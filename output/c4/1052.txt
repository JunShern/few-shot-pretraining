    "text": "It\u2019s not always our choice as children to be emotional deprived, which is the feeling that we\u2019re not loved enough or are important enough, which can persist into our adult lives. This results in having a mindset of scarcity. This is the feeling, that we never have enough of the things that we want or need more of. That we\u2019re always lacking.\nWhat this sense of insecurity does, is it harms our closest relationships, as what we\u2019re expecting is that they\u2019ll let us down somehow. We never express our needs directly to them, while also avoiding intimacy. We feel deprived of emotions such as love, time, or money.\nWe act as if we\u2019re constantly in panic mode, as we penny pinch even if we don\u2019t need to. We\u2019ll schedule every moment of our day. These are the thoughts of having a scarcity mindset. That things will get worse, rather than get better.\nYou wake up, get of out bed and instantly feel that you don\u2019t have enough time. You wake up feeling you didn\u2019t get enough sleep, and then deprive yourself of all the important things that you needed to do that day.\nYou\u2019re bad at time management. You then have no idea how the days, weeks, and years of your life have slipped away so fast. You over schedule appointments, while spending too much time changing them. You\u2019re always late paying your bills.\nYou think you\u2019re losing it, but you\u2019re just incompetent at managing time. These issues fall under the laws of scarcity. It\u2019s found that those living with limited resources, who are poor, are more likely to make these types of bad decisions.\nThis occurs especially when it comes to money and relationship issues. It\u2019s found to be instinctive and not always their fault, as that\u2019s how the brain responds to scarcity.\nOnce we develop a mindset of scarcity, what doing so does is it narrows down our time frame, which causes us to make short term erratic decisions, which are usually impulsive.\nDoing so throws our long-term goals in disarray, such as we\u2019ll delay paying our credit card bills, hoping that they\u2019ll disappear, or not answer the phone thinking it\u2019s bad news.\nFarmers who have a scarcity mindset, will become stressed when planting their seeds, but will relax once they\u2019ve had a successful harvest. They become short on money, constantly worry about the weather, and worry about the market conditions.\nOnce someone is forced to deal with extremely limited resources, what that does is it increases the problems and the barriers that they need to deal with, which results in mental fatigue.\nThose who are constantly deprived of what they want, develops an unhealthy obsession of overvaluing the things they don\u2019t have. The nature of scarcity itself, however, impedes our efforts of coping.\nThe stress and the anxiety that\u2019s associated with scarcity, interferes with our motivation, which causes us to become more vulnerable towards temptation.\nThis is the reason why some will purchase items on sale, even if they don\u2019t need it. This can occur right after an emotional period such as the holidays, when they can\u2019t really afford it.\nThe reason for this, is because of scarcity thinking. We think that we\u2019re unable to resist the limited time of the sale, which the marketers prey on.\nThose who are alone, will often see themselves and others in a more negative pessimistic light. They may avoid joining social gatherings and activities, based on the fear of rejection.\nSo how can we correct living in this scarcity mindset, while not becoming overly complacent. To feel more comfortable at the various levels of scarcity, and not feel deprived.\n\u2022 Practice Gratitude \u2013 Always focus on what\u2019s currently good about your life, which includes all those who support you. The community you live in, and your healthy active lifestyle. What doing so does, is it takes the focus off scarcity, such as time and money.\n\u2022 Never Compare Yourself To Others \u2013 You\u2019ll always meet someone who\u2019s better than you. They will have more money, time, or possessions than you. You may then feel a tinge of envy. But in reality, you have no idea what it\u2019s like to be them.\nSo never compare how you\u2019re feeling inside, to how someone appears to be physically. What your struggles have created, are internal strengths that you don\u2019t completely appreciate.\nBreaking away from this cycle, requires plenty of preparation and effort. Create a plan so you won\u2019t catch yourself ruminating. What getting active does, is it activates the left hemisphere of the brain, which avoids moodiness and depression.\nSo instead, decide to go for a walk or a run. Call someone. Tidy up your closet or garage, wash your car, or read a good book. Just keep busy.\n\u2022 Take Precautionary Measures \u2013 Make a grocery list whenever you go to the supermarket and stick to it, so you won\u2019t impulse buy.\nSet up prepayment withdrawals for all your bills to be automatically withdrawn from your bank account. Leave your credit card at home. Remove all the sweets and refined sugar products from your home.\n\u2022 Never Become Greedy \u2013 Whenever there\u2019s a feeling that resources are becoming scarce, what most will do is get competitive with each other. This since they believe that if someone else gets more, that they\u2019ll get less.\nOnce you decide to help someone grow their business for instance, they may in return be more than willing to refer new business to you.\nBeing helpful towards others, leads to gaining greater respect and reputation, which develops deeper relationships, while creating exchange and making new allies."
