    "text": "Amsterdam has long been a popular summer destination for tourists flocking from far and wide to sample the sun, entertainment, and ~herbal remedies~. The Dutch capital is jam-packed with fun things to see and do to suit a range of tastes and preferences. Summer is usually the busiest time for tourists in the city, and for good reason, too. Amsterdam is one of the best places to spend a few days in the summer for a number of reasons. So, whether you\u2019re counting down the days \u2019til your summer break to \u2018Dam, or if you\u2019re merely considering to visit Amsterdam this summer, then here are a few reasons why you should just go for it.\nWhat better time to enjoy a canal cruise than during the summer months? Amsterdam is famous for its sprawling canals, and taking a canal cruise is one of the most common things to do here. With sparkling waters and views of all the different neighbourhoods, it\u2019s the perfect opportunity to take some good photographs. The guided boat tours provide the chance to learn about the history of Amsterdam\u2019s canals, and the night-time ones with a candlelit dinner included are incredibly romantic. Book your canal cruise before you head off to \u2018Dam online to save money \u2013 there\u2019s a range of websites offering all kinds of boat trips around the city.\nWhat sets Amsterdam apart from major European cities (aside from the obvious) is its lenience on barbecues. Tourists in Amsterdam can take their disposable barbecues and Dutch sausages to the following parks: Oosterpark, Rembrandtpark, Sloterpark, Meerpark, Frankendael and also Amsterdamse Bos. After a day exploring the city\u2019s vast museums, what better way to wind down before a night on the town than eating burgers in the sun? Yes, please.\nAmsterdam is a mecca of outdoor markets that are thriving in the summer months. There really is a market for everyone in Amsterdam, and each one is a bustling, multi-cultural paradise. The Singel Flower Market is one of the most colourful sights in the city. The market is home to practically every flower in existence, including a wide selection of tulips, of course. Each stall is located inside a row of floating barges. On the other hand, the Noordermarkt takes over the Noordermarkt Square every Saturday. Here you can find a range of organic foods, fine antiques, oriental rugs and vintage clothing. Be sure to go to these markets when you visit Amsterdam this summer."
