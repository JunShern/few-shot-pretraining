The same engines and drivetrain components that power John Deere equipment, power thousands of OEM applications around the world. That's the power of John Deere.\nOur engines power more than John Deere green and yellow machines. John Deere engines are at the heart of a vast array of machines that perform the work around us. They provide the lifeblood that powers your work.\nJohn Deere OEM engine application capabilities.\nA customer testimonial from Puck Custom Enterprises, Inc. who specializes in high performance nutrient handling solutions using pumps powered by John Deere engines.\nChad Pregracke's not-for-profit organization, Living Lands & Waters, is fueling a nationwide environmental movement that is cleaning up America's inland rivers. John Deere is helping propel his work with reliable marine power.\nWhat do you need to know to operate the latest generation of diesel engines from John Deere? As you\u2019ll learn in this video, most of the new systems take care of themselves. John Deere followed a carefully planned approach to meeting Final Tier 4/Stage IV emissions regulations that doesn\u2019t compromise on power, uptime, durability, or ease of operation. We were able to make these advancements with minimal impact on operators thanks to technologies like advanced engine control units and smart exhaust filters that clean themselves using the engine\u2019s natural heat. You\u2019ll also learn about the addition of selective catalytic reduction (SCR), the proper use and storage of diesel exhaust fluid (DEF), and take a look at symbols and controls the machine operator may see during exhaust filter cleaning and SCR operation.\nA proven way to get faster, smoother, easier starts during cold winter months, saving you plenty in time, money and engine wear.\nWe know how the best engines should work because we build them. That's why our approach to meeting Final Tier 4 emissions regulations allows us to focus the performance of the engine's power, efficiency, and responsiveness, rather than just emissions compliance. Learn more at http://www.JohnDeere.com/FT4 or see your local John Deere dealer.\nSee how John Deere PowerTech\u2122 Final Tier 4/Stage IV engines with the Integrated Emissions Control system offer the right technology for maximum performance.\nJohn Deere's Straightforward Blog (http://bit.ly/hcXSGr ) is your hub for the latest emissions news. This video breaks down the process of regeneration, or \"burning off\" particulate matter from diesel engines and answers your questions on operator maintenance routine.\nWatch this video to learn about the emission technologies that John Deere will use to meet Interim Tier 4/Stage III B off-highway emissions regulations for diesel engines.\nEmission regulations are quickly expanding globally. To meet with the individual emission regulation across the globe, Kubota offers industrial engine line-up up to 100HP seamlessly. With the technologies such as cooled EGR, CRS, DPF, and ECU, all are certificated by the latest EPA (CARB) and EU regulations. Spark Ignited engines are also developed as alternative Tier 4 solution with the same footprint and similar performance to diesel engines. Kubota offers solutions for use in every corner of the world."
