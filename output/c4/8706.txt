Honda Finance Europe Plc is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, Financial Services Register number 312541.\nThe legion of VFR800F fans know exactly what they like about their bike and also what they\u2019d like more \u2013 and less \u2013 of in a new model. With such an important model Honda has listened intently to customers\u2019 views; in essence they want a high-quality motorcycle with strong low and mid-range torque, light and slim but just as capable and adaptable, with a return to the evocative look and feel of VFRs of the past.\nTwo factors were key drivers for Honda\u2019s engineers in development of the new VFR800F \u2013 firstly, to retain and expand the essential VFR qualities that inspire so many, and, secondly, to update the new model with modern features and technologies.\nStarting with the 782cc V4-VTEC engine, bottom and mid-range power have been boosted, to strike the ideal balance of enjoyable sports riding and easy commuting. The VTEC transition has been softened and the resulting power delivery is smooth, strong and linear. Honda\u2019s TCS (Traction Control System) has also been added.\nExtensive work has gone into making the new VFR800F lighter than its predecessor, a whole 7kg lighter in fact. A single exhaust muffler has replaced the dual underseat design of the previous model and a host of detail changes save weight.\nA brand new Pro-Arm single-sided swingarm, 43mm telescopic fork, radial-mount four-piston front brake calipers and redesigned wheels hang from the quintessentially VFR twin-spar aluminium beam frame. Seat height is adjustable by 20mm, ABS is fitted as standard and \u2013 for the first time \u2013 a Honda Genuine Accessories shift assist system is available to bolt straight on.\nAnd then there\u2019s the styling. Considerably slimmer in the middle than the outgoing bike the 2014 VFR800F mixes a sleek silhouette with crisp, contemporary angles \u2013 and more than an echo of classic VFR design.\nThe VFR800F\u2019s 782cc, liquid-cooled 16-valve DOHC 90\u00b0 V4-VTEC engine has received significant development \u2013 mainly focusing on cam timing and valve duration/overlap \u2013 to deliver the required increase in low-to midrange power and torque. Peak power of 77.9kW is delivered at 10,250rpm, with peak torque of 75.1Nm arriving at 8,500rpm.\nVTEC valve timing still operates one pair of inlet/exhaust valves per cylinder at low rpm, and then switches to four as revs rise but the transition is now seamless. Combined with the uprated torque, the effect is a remarkably linear power delivery and effortless overtaking at highway speeds.\nBore and stroke is 72mm x 48mm, with compression ratio of 11.8:1. The PGM-FI fuel injection \u2013 with 36mm throttle bodies \u2013 has been remapped to suit the engine\u2019s new performance parameters, and fuel economy is 19.4km/l (WMTC).\nThe diamond triple-box section aluminium twin-spar frame is unchanged; a revised die-cast aluminium subframe is significantly lighter than the previous model. In total, kerb weight is reduced by 7kg to 242kg. Rake is set at 25\u00b030\u2019 with trail of 95mm and 1,460mm wheelbase.\nCompletely new are the aluminium single-sided Pro-arm swingarm and 43mm Honda Multi-Action System (HMAS) telescopic fork. They feature stepless spring preload adjustment and 108mm wheel travel; the HMAS gas-charged rear shock operates through a Pro-Link suspension linkage with remote spring preload and stepless rebound damping adjustment.\nThe fork lowers have been redesigned in two pieces to accept radial-mount four-piston brake calipers. New Fine Die-Cast (FDC) hollow aluminium wheels employ dual 310mm floating discs up front and a 256mm disc at the rear. The front rim is a 17M/C x MT3.50, the rear a 17M/C x MT5.50 with 120/70 ZR17M/C (58W) and 180/55 ZR17M/C (73W) tyres. 2-channel ABS provides consistent and safe all-weather stopping control.\n\u2018Elegant Sport\u2019 is the essence of the VFR800F and its stunning new bodywork not only provides a contemporary outline, with a mixture of sharp angles and soft curves it pays respect to design elements from the VFR\u2019s history \u2013 details like the small air intake duct on the fairing\u2019s flank.\nThe VFR-signature \u2018X\u2019 headlight shape is updated and now features LED lights \u2013 a first for Honda. Positional lights are integrated with the wing mirrors, just like the VFR1200F. At the rear, the wide, angular tailpiece offers plenty of room for a pillion and features an LED rear light unit with combined indicators for a clean look. With fuel economy of 19.4km/l (WMTC), the 21.5-litre fuel tank offers a 350km plus cruising range.\nAt 500mm the width around the middle cowl is reduced by 40mm giving the VFR800F a slim and compact feel. The seat is height adjustable (789mm or 809mm) using the tool provided and a handlebar height spacer, adding 15mm is available as a Honda Genuine Accessory.\nA new dashboard houses a digital speedometer/tachometer plus gear position indicator, ambient temperature gauge, fuel consumption information and clock. There\u2019s also an indicator for the 5-stage heated grips, which are fitted as standard. A compact automotive-style \u2018wave\u2019 design key \u2013 with internal grooving \u2013 reduces the chance of breakage.\nFor the very first time Honda Genuine Accessories are offering a shift assist system. Designed to bolt on and plug straight in it provides race-style split-second upshifts with no need to use the clutch."
