    "text": "I've owned an iPad for almost a year now, and I'm a complete convert: I use it to read books and magazines, to watch movies, and to research and write these very posts. But I've been reluctant to let my kids get their grubby little paws on it, mostly, I think, out of bad emotions like selfishness (\"It's my precious...\") and fear (\"Omigod, what if they break it?). Beyond teasing them with occasional looks at the stunning Star Walk app\u2014which uses the device's GPS to give you a full, accurate view of the night sky that you can hold up to identify stars, planets, and even satellites, and may represent the best three dollars I\u2019ve ever spent\u2014I've kept the iPad firmly out of their reach.\nWhich means that beyind being a cruel parent, I know next to nothing about the burgeoning world of iPad games for kids. I have resolved to change, on both fronts, but each passing day makes the prospect of entering that world more daunting, as another umpteen games hit the market. How on earth does a moderately late adapter figure out which are the good ones and which ones are crap?\nAnyway, Ian was gracious enough to give me not only some excellent kids' game recommendations for the iPad, but a few security tips for the wary parent on putting one's precious into child hands.\n1. Click on Settings. The third setting is \u201cNotifications\u201d; turn them off for all the games your kids download and then annoy you with. This will prevent \u201cYour Smurfs are hungry!\u201d from popping up on your screen in the middle of that important Keynote presentation at the office.\nOther good choices: Battleheart (a mild fantasy game, with combat; $2.99), Pocket Frogs (in which you breed, well, frogs\u2014surprisingly addictive, and free!), and Puzzle Planet (just what it sounds like: jigsaw puzzles, with an iPad twist; also free!).\nIan\u2019s kids\u2019 faves: Solomon's Keep (think Harry Potter mixed with D&D, in a simple app; $0.99), LEGO Harry Potter (the real thing, except in LEGOs\u2014four movies\u2019 worth of plot and levels, all incredibly habit-forming; $4.99), Cut the Rope (a very clever and original puzzle game; $0.99), and of course Freeverse\u2019s own Parachute Ninja (a flying adventure/story-driven game; $0.99).\nThanks for this! My Dash loves all things frogs, so we'll definitely check out the Pocket Frogs game.\nI found your blog through Daily Candy and find myself coming back to this post anytime we need new iPad games! We like Cut the Rope, Battleheart and Math Ninja. Our boys are 3 and 7 and have discovered our Plants vs Zombies app... not very age appropriate. We like Cows in Space, Hippo High Dive (like Papi Jump), Trainyard EX, Touch Hockey Extreme (like table air hockey). Our oldest likes NinjaChicken (I think made by the Angry Birds people) and Fieldrunners (both have cannons or guns that fire at opponents, just FYI).\nAnyway, just wanted to share our favorites. Looking forward to finding more. Thanks also for the tips about the Settings... smart.\nThanks--glad it's been a help!\nSecurity Blanket: Here Comes the Garbage Barge!"
