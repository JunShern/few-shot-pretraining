    "text": "Proof Alliance is committed to preventing prenatal alcohol exposure and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) by creating awareness of the risks associated with drinking alcohol while pregnant and increasing the number of people who plan their pregnancies and engage in healthy behaviors before becoming pregnant. In support of this work, we are seeking applications from colleges and universities that are interested in engaging their student population through events focused on preventing alcohol-exposed pregnancies. Colleges can request up to $2,500 to host one or multiple prevention events on campus.\nThe College Ambassador Program focuses on early prevention efforts on college campuses. Most college students are not actively considering starting a family, but many are engaging in high-risk behaviors such as alcohol use and unprotected sexual activity, both of which increase the risk of unintended pregnancy.1 In Minnesota, 60% of college students report monthly alcohol use, and nearly 1 in 4 engage in high-risk drinking. Nearly 80% of female college students in Minnesota are sexually active, and 15.6% report having used emergency contraception at least once.2 By informing students about preconception health and the importance of planned, alcohol-free pregnancies, grantees will: increase the students\u2019 awareness of FASD; help them address and reduce risky health behaviors; and decrease their risk of unplanned and/or alcohol-exposed pregnancies.\nFor any questions related to the College Ambassador Program, please contact Sarah Brown at sarah.brown@proofalliance.org or 651-917-2370.\n Huber LRB, Ersek JL.
