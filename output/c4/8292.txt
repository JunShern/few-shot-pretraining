    "text": "Dad was a hard-working guy. I remember once he didn't take a sick day for five years straight and he was so proud of it. His accounting job didn't pay much, but somehow he and Mom always put enough away for a family vacation. Of course there was sightseeing -- a trip to the Deerfield Fair, 4th of July fireworks at Hampton Beach, hiking in the White Mountains or a trek to numerous \"kissing bridges.\" But thinking back, I realized the best thing about these trips, was the fact that we had time ... for unhurried walks in the woods ... for laughing 'til it hurt watching Dad trying to master the hula hoop ... for singing silly songs around the campfire ... for thinking and dreaming.\nWhen family members or friends aren't able to help the older adults they love, Home Instead CAREGiversSM can.
