    "text": "as a franchise stockpiling draft picks Anthony Beauvillier Jersey Womens , Vegas Golden Knights general manager George McPhee is using them for the Knights\u2019 unexpected playoff push.The Knights acquired forward Tomas Tatar from the Detroit Red Wings for three draft picks on Monday. The Red Wings will receive Vegas\u2019 2018 first-round pick, a 2019 second-round pick that originally belonged to the New York Islanders and Vegas\u2019 2021 third-round pick.It was a steep price for the 27-year-old, but one that McPhee was willing to pay considering Las Vegas\u2019 stunning debut season. The Knights are at the top of the Western Conference in their first season.\u201dIt was easy because when we acquired all of those picks we said we\u2019re either going to use those picks to draft players or to acquire players and this is an example of acquiring a player,\u201d McPhee said.\u201dThe picks that we gave up are spread out over four drafts so we have lots of picks and to spread them out over four drafts was not a problem for us. It was the way we were hoping to do a deal today.\u201dTatar adds both scoring and depth to Vegas\u2019 lineup. Tatar has 16 goals and 12 assists this season and is under contract through the 2020-21 season. He\u2019s topped the 20-goal mark in each of the past three seasons and had 19 goals in his first full season in the league in 2013-14.\u201dWe went into the deadline with one thing circled on our board, or at least this part of the deadline, and that was adding one more top-nine forward and we accomplished that,\u201d McPhee said.\u201dHe\u2019s only 27. He\u2019s quick, he\u2019s competitive and he can score. He\u2019s scored 20 goals a season over the last three years and he\u2019s on pace to do it again. We didn\u2019t want to trade draft picks for someone that isn\u2019t going to be here after the summer and he has three years left on his contract, we\u2019re happy about that.\u201dWith the Red Wings five points out of the final wild-card spot in the Eastern Conference Dustin Tokarski Jersey Womens , turning to the future was the way to go according to general manager Ken Holland.\u201dWe really made the deal because we\u2019re looking toward the future,\u201d Holland said. \u201dObviously we missed the playoffs last year and we\u2019re five points out this year and we\u2019ve got a tough road to hoe here ahead.\u201d\u2014 EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) \u2014 The longest point streak in the NHL this season will extend through the holiday break.Nikita Kucherov had a goal and four assists, Steven Stamkos and Tyler Johnson each scored twice and the Tampa Bay Lightning stretched their run to 12 games with a 6-3 victory over the Edmonton Oilers on Saturday night.\u201cI\u2019m just playing hockey and trying to enjoy the game, trying to make the right play every time and sometimes it doesn\u2019t happen, sometimes it happens and today it happened,\u201d Kucherov said.J.T. Miller also scored for the NHL-leading Lightning (28-7-2), who are 11-0-1 in their last 12 games.\u201cI think we played great,\u201d defenseman Victor Hedman said. \u201cOverall Valtteri Filppula Jersey Womens , it was a great performance by the guys and you can tell we really wanted to win this game and go into the break on a high note, and we\u2019re feeling good about ourselves.\u201dRyan Nugent-Hopkins, Alex Chiasson and Leon Draisaitl scored for the Oilers (18-15-3), who have dropped three straight. Connor McDavid had three assists.\u201cRather than relying on the same people every night to do everything, I\u2019m trying to get people connected,\u201d Edmonton coach Ken Hitchcock said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to figure out who\u2019s helping and who\u2019s hurting, for us to get to another level.\u201cWe can\u2019t keep doing it the same way over and over. It\u2019s not going to work.\u201dEdmonton goalie Mikko Koskinen lost for the first time on home ice this season, falling to 7-1-0.The Oilers got on the board first midway through the opening period on a give-and-go play from McDavid to Nugent-Hopkins, who sent his 12th goal past Tampa Bay goaltender Andrei Vasilevskiy.McDavid picked up his 200th career assist on the play Fredrik Claesson Jersey Womens , becoming the sixth player in NHL history to reach the milestone before his 22nd birthday \u2014 joining a club that includes Wayne Gretzky, Sidney Crosby, Mario Lemieux, Dale Hawerchuk and Ron Francis.Tampa Bay tied it on a power play with three minutes left in the first when Stamkos fired a one-timer past Koskinen for his 19th of the season.Koskinen made a huge save on Kucherov\u2019s breakaway early in the second.The Oilers pulled back in front on the power play three minutes into the middle period when Chiasson tipped a point shot by Darnell Nurse.Kucherov got another clear breakaway with seven minutes left in the second and this time made no mistake in scoring his 16th goal.The Lightning went up 3-2 a minute and a half later as Miller redirected a shot from in front of the net.Tampa Bay added to its lead four minutes into the second when Johnson pounced on a big rebound for his 15th.Edmonton got that one back quickly on a power play as McDavid fed the puck to Draisaitl for his 17th of the season, but the Lightning put it away on Stamkos\u2019 second of the game with five minutes left and an empty-netter from Johnson.\u201cWe\u2019re going to need a little better out of everyone,\u201d Chiasson said.UP NEXTLightning: Return home to face the Philadelphia Flyers on Thursday after the Christmas break.Oilers: Host the Vancouver Canucks on Thursday."
