And I took unto me two staves; the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock.\n11:10 And I took my staff, [even] Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the people.\n11:11 And it was broken in that day: and so the poor of the flock that waited upon me knew that it [was] the word of the LORD.\n11:12 And I said unto them, If ye think good, give [me] my price; and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my price thirty [pieces] of silver.\n11:13 And the LORD said unto me, Cast it unto the potter: a goodly price that I was prised at of them. And I took the thirty [pieces] of silver, and cast them to the potter in the house of the LORD.\n11:14 Then I cut asunder mine other staff, [even] Bands, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.\n11:16 For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, [which] shall not visit those that be cut off, neither shall seek the young one, nor heal that that is broken, nor feed that that standeth still: but he shall eat the flesh of the fat, and tear their claws in pieces.\n11:17 Woe to the idol shepherd that leaveth the flock! the sword [shall be] upon his arm, and upon his right eye: his arm shall be clean dried up, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened."
