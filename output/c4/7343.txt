Wait a minute\u2026.If this is the case why do you see some athletes walking out of the gym with handfuls of gummy bears, jelly beans, or a bag of skittles?\nWell, have you ever stopped to ask them? Don\u2019t, because they probably couldn\u2019t tell you why they are doing it. You would probably get a response like\u2026\u201dbecause I saw that one guy with big muscles doing it..or..because Milton told me to\u201d. Well my friends, Coach Korbie here is going to answer the question of what to eat after a workout to build muscle.\nLet us examine the process for muscle growth and making changes to your physique that will help you reach those fitness goals. You must first comprehend what happens to the body during an intense workout. During exercise, cortisol levels will elevate as you burn fat and break down muscle tissue. This enables your muscles to rebuild and grow bigger during the recovery process.\nDuring a workout, cortisol and energizing hormones like the adrenaline hormones and growth hormone are released. This allows the body to free fat stores so the we can utilize them for energy. Insulin, a storage hormone will then decrease at this time.\nWhy is it a Good Idea to Spike Your Insulin After a Workout?\nNow that you have a basic understanding of what happens to your body when working out, let\u2019s make it clear as to why an insulin spike post workout may be favorable. As previously mentioned when cortisol levels are elevated, insulin levels are low. After an intense workout, cortisol levels have increased to get you through that heavy lifting session. In addition your glycogen stores are depleted, and you have torn down your muscle tissue.\nTo start that recovery process and repair and build muscle tissue, you must spike your insulin. To create an insulin spike after training, a simple carbohydrate (sugars) should be consumed. Insulin transports nutrients to the organs in the body, including muscle cells. While insulin is driving amino acids and glucose into muscle cells, it also prevents the \u2018leaking out\u2019 of these nutrients from the muscle cells that usually occur in response to training.\nWhat Exactly Should I Eat After My Workout?\nYou made it through a heavy lifting session. You maxed out and surpassed all your reps. Now what? Does this mean you reward yourself and go for a king size Snickers bar? After all, you just experienced major muscle breakdown and you want those quads to grow. Not so fast. Yes, insulin does promote muscle growth. However, you must take into consideration what your fitness goals are. What exactly are you trying to achieve?\nTo reach those fitness goals and build the physique you strive for, you must eat according to your body type and your goals. This is where I come in. You will see the best results when you seek professional help from a nutrition management specialist like us here at Training Innovations.

You know how much you should weigh. You know your ideal pant size. You can even picture how great those skinny jeans will look. So why aren\u2019t you living life in your ideal body? There are many complex reasons that make weight loss a challenge, reasons that go deeper than simply calories-in versus calories-out. I\u2019m talking about the life issues that get in the way of your success. Here are 5 obstacles to your fitness success and the solutions to unlock your best body ever.\nIt\u2019s in your DNA to avoid pain and seek out pleasure. Unfortunately this works against you when trying to get fit. You see, in your mind it\u2019s painful (or at least uncomfortable) to deny yourself the tasty food that you crave and to exert yourself with exercise.\nThere\u2019s a simple way to work around this obstacle. First find something painful about being fat to motivate yourself towards healthy eating and exercise. Then, focus on the negative impact your current weight has on your health, self-esteem and lifestyle. And finally, convince yourself that the pain of being out of shape is much greater than the discomfort of losing weight.\nJust as you wish to avoid pain, you are also an expert in seeking out pleasure \u2013 namely food. This served the cavemen well, but these days it ends up as extra pounds around your waist and thighs. But there\u2019s good news: extra calories are not your only option to stimulate the pleasure center of your brain. Find an activity or two that make you smile and indulge in those regularly.\nLet\u2019s face it, you work too much, commit yourself to too much and don\u2019t even get enough sleep most of the time. And the fast-paced way you live leaves you exhausted, stressed and hungry for comfort food. So you begin to feel too busy to take care of your health. It\u2019s time to reprioritize. Let go of your perfectionist standards and remove a few commitments from your schedule so that you are able to cook healthy meals, exercise and get a good night\u2019s sleep. Remind yourself that taking care of your health is not a luxury \u2013 it\u2019s a necessity.\nI don\u2019t agree with it, but you sure act like you don\u2019t deserve to live the good life in the body of your dreams. Take a moment to think back on all the times you have self-sabotaged your weight loss efforts. If you don\u2019t believe deep down that you are worthy then you\u2019ll never give yourself a chance at a fit body. I believe that you deserve to have a healthy body \u2013 and I urge you to dig deep down to uncover why you don\u2019t. Once you conquer your feelings of unworthiness, defeating the obstacles to your fitness success will be easy.\nFor more help with conquering the obstacles to your fitness success, reaching your fitness goals, or if you\u2019re frustrated with the results you\u2019ve been seeing at the gym and are thinking about hiring a personal trainer, contact us!\nHow to Increase Flexibility! 4 Ways.\nYou eat the right foods, drink the right drinks, and exercise regularly.

From breakfast cereals, to coffee drinks, to protein bars, to energy drinks\u2026more items in your daily diet contain sugar than you\u2019re aware of. All of these sugar calories add up quickly and translate into many pounds gained.Make it a habit to read the ingredients and the sugar count in the foods you are eating. Pay special attention to breakfast items, yogurts, protein bars and any item that is packaged. Avoid eating foods that contain added sugars as a part of your daily diet.\nThere used to be a time and place when desserts were reserved for Sunday evenings and special occasions. Not anymore!

Forget eating dessert everyday. Save desserts for cheat days and special occasions, and stick with fresh fruit as your daily after-meal sweet.\nIn recent years snacking has been named one of the best ways to maintain your metabolism, in order to burn fat all day long; and while there is some truth to eating small, high protein-high fiber meals frequently, for the most part all of this snacking has done nothing better than make us fat.

It\u2019s actually quite simple. High fiber foods are nutrient dense and low in calories. This means that you\u2019ll feel full from fewer calories, encouraging weight loss. Try these high fiber favorites: spinach, raspberries, pear (with skin), artichoke, peas, apples (with skin), broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and carrots.\nDon\u2019t be afraid to eat when you are on the get-great-abs-quickly plan. It is really important that you are nourishing your body with quality, lean protein in order to develop that six-pack. Lean protein helps support muscle growth while controlling blood sugar \u2013 all important factors when it come to washboard abs. Good sources of protein include: chicken breast, ground turkey, egg whites, and grilled fish.\nIf you only did this step, and skipped all the rest, your abs would look significantly flatter by summer. I can\u2019t emphasize enough how quickly sugar will cover your hard earned stomach muscles with a soft layer of fat. Yes, sugar tastes good, but indulging in it causes your body to store layers of fat. Enjoy fresh fruit, rather than refined sugar. Once you stop eating sugar your body will no longer crave it, so don\u2019t give in to the initial cravings.\nSure, whole grains are being touted as essential to a healthy diet, but the truth is that you\u2019ll do just fine without them for a while. Even the heartiest wholegrain bread will encourage fat storage, so put down the breadbasket as you prepare for beach season. Grains are full of insulin-spiking carbohydrates \u2013 the perfect combination for fattening you up. Learn to love grain-free meals that center around lean meats and vegetables.\nHigh intensity bursts of cardio are a proven way to burn away layers of fat, so incorporate sprints into your exercise routine. If you haven\u2019t run for a while, take it easy as you start, and gradually increase the intensity of your sprints. Run 60-90 second sprints in between resistance training sets to really kick your fat burning mechanism into high gear."
