    "text": "From Connections: Just what do you mean Connections?\nConnections: Member to Member was first published as an insert in the February 1998 issue of The Journal. It was the brainchild of Mark Farmer, its founder and original publisher.\nI believe Mark's idea was to create a publication that would be helpful and informative to those of us with a Church of God background, yet light and noncontroversial in nature. Mark has moved on to other ventures, but his vision for Connections is what we continue to strive for.\nIn keeping with Mark's original intent, I'd like to see Connections develop into a publication that would truly connect us. Just like a family, we need a place to come together, to laugh, to remember, to hug and to share what's happening in our own families. But, just as in families, let's not take ourselves too seriously.\nYes, we do sell advertising space, but I see Connections as more than that. Prayer requests and certain other announcements of a serious nature will continue to be printed free of charge in the classifieds section. I'd like to encourage each of you to please share your thoughts, snapshots, poems or stories of bygone eras so that as space permits we can all enjoy them.\nThe idea behind Connections is to offer an addition to The Journal that deals specifically with drawing people together, whether it be through the listing of prayer requests, locating old friends, swapping sermon tapes, advertising Feast sites, offering booklets or simply providing an avenue for a little fun.\nWorking with Connections continues to be a learning experience for me, and I appreciate Dixon Cartwright's abundant patience that he continues to exhibit as I muddle through each month. There's no doubt that the most enjoyable part of working with Connections is meeting and getting to know so many people. I look forward to hearing from many more of you in the future.\nTraditionally, as the fall holy days approach, our lives seem to become increasingly more hectic each passing day. Instead of letting things spiral out of control, why don't we decide now to slow down and really enjoy the meaning of God's Feast days?\nAs we enter the fall holy-day season I'd like to wish for each of you a time of peace and spiritual rejuvenation. Have a good one."
