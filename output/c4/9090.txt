    "text": "Weight loss occurs when the amount of calories you take in is less than those you burn. We all know that if we eat high-calorie foods, it's going to take a lot to burn them off.\nFor instance, if you like your morning roti prata with egg (around 289 calories), you'll have to take a brisk walk for around an hour and a half to burn it off. You can still enjoy that delicious dish, but why not make it a treat, and not a routine?\nWhile exercise goes hand in hand with a healthy diet, making a few good food choices helps us make sure the dial on the bathroom scales goes down instead of up.\nReplace sugary and artificially sweetened drinks with fresh coconut juice or plain water.\nDouble your vegetable intake and halve your meat intake \u2013 let your veggies and not your mutton rending curry be the star of your lunch.\nReplace sugary desserts with one serving of fresh fruit.\nIf you usually eat deep fried food three times a week, reduce this to a once-a-week indulgence.\nStart the day with a healthy breakfast. Protein-rich eggs are good (boiled or poached), and they will keep you satisfied until lunch \u2013 just don't be tempted by the empty calories of the accompanying kaya toast.\nMost successful dieters find that having four to five small meals a day is better than loading up on three large ones. It keeps hunger at bay, making it less likely you will succumb to an unhealthy choice.\nIf you are a snacker, swap your morning muffin or afternoon cake for healthy options such as celery with peanut butter, plain nuts with a square of dark chocolate, or half an avocado.\nBeware of low-calorie options. You might think that low-calorie dressing or half-fat coconut milk is better for you, but the addition of additives such as sugar can still make it high in calories.\nDownsize your plate. If you have a smaller plate, you'll eat less \u2013 just don't compensate by piling it high to make up for the fact it's not as wide!\nNo one's saying you have to deny yourself \u2013 just be sensible. If you crave chicken rice, halve your portion.\nManaging your weight is as much a state of mind as a plan of action. Help yourself by shopping for groceries after you've eaten. If you're eating out, have a couple of glasses of water before you go \u2013 feeling full is a great deterrent to overeating."
