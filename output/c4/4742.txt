    "text": "Being employees, it is of mere importance that we know how much we\u2019re working for on a monthly basis. This is a given; our monthly salaries are already given to us and that\u2019s part of the reason why we\u2019re accepting jobs and offers from different employees. But do you actually calculate how much you\u2019re earning per day? per week? Do you even know how much money you generate per hour? In this article, we will teach you how you can compute not just for your daily rate, we\u2019ll help you compute how much your hourly rate is depending on your monthly salary.\nWhy is computing for my hourly rate important?\nIn general, knowing how to compute is an essential tool. It\u2019s not only applicable to compensation, knowing how to compute for things can actually help you even when you go abroad for either vacation or for work. It\u2019s a mere fact of knowing how much you\u2019re getting, how much you\u2019re buying a certain product for, and somewhere along those lines.\nHere in the Philippines, especially in call centers, there are companies in which holidays, night differentials, and hazard pay premiums are given or added on an hourly basis. Another reason why knowing how to compute for an hourly rate is an important thing.\nNOTE: The total number of working hours in a day may vary from person to person or from company to company. If you\u2019re unsure of how much hours you work for in a day, inquire about it first. Furthermore, if you think you\u2019re working for more than five (5) days a week, inquire about it as well.\nNow that you know all of your variables, it\u2019s time for you to know the formula on how you can compute for your hourly rate. In the examples we\u2019ll provide, let\u2019s assume that the monthly rate is Php20, 000.00; the total number of working days in a year is 261 days; and lastly, the total number of hours in a day is 8 hours.\nBy putting the formula to work, we arrive at a Php115.00 hourly rate if the basic salary of the employee is Php20, 000.00 per month.\nRead: How to Compute your Salary during Regular Holidays and Special (Non-Working) Days?\nBut what if the employee is paid on a daily basis?\nIf the employee is paid on a daily basis, we\u2019ll follow the same formula; same procedure. We just have to take out the daily rate and divide it by the number of hours.\nThere you go, you now know how to compute for your daily rate. You just have to know the variables beforehand so that you can properly calculate it.\nWait, how did we know the total number of working days in a year?\nWe all know that a calendar year has 365 days, so why is the total number of working days only 261? We should, of course, exclude the weekends and the holidays. In a 7-day week, we\u2019re only required to go to work at least 40 hours. That means for 5 days, we only work 8 hours every day.\nIn addition to that, the Department of Labor and Employment has the formula on how that is computed. Click on this link to access the formula for both non-muslims and Muslims.\nWhy is it important that I know my hourly or even my daily rate?\nOur employers are not perfect; they commit mistakes as well especially if the employees of a certain corporation are thousands. By you knowing how you should properly compute for your daily or hourly rate, you get to see whether or not there are errors on your payslip when payday is just right around the corner.\nIf you notice an error within the computation, let your immediate supervisor aware about this right away so they can help you with the modifications and with the corrections. You can\u2019t expect that your pay is always right and is always spotless; people and the payroll team make mistakes, too.\nBut now that you\u2019re equipped with the knowledge, you can do the computation on your own without asking the help of someone from your payroll department.
