    "text": "We\u2019ve been incredibly impressed this year with all the changes and additions Great Adventure has made to their annual Fright Fest event. This up charge attraction seems to just keep getting better with age.\n\u200bFor guests that have previously experienced fright fest numerous improvements await them this year.\nWe've also got some EXCLUSIVE pics of Justice League Battle for Metropolis as well as a look at Rage of the Gargoyles.\nPerennially, The Dead Man\u2019s Party: Graveyard Rock has been the official start to the Fright Fest festivities. This year numerous improvements have been made to the event including a noticeable addition of production value with more dancers, ghouls, lasers and pyrotechnics on stage. The largest improvement though, has been the complete relocation of the event into the former Batman Stunt Show Theater. This gives the event formal seating and improved sight lines for all guests. It also allows the party to go on throughout the entire length of Fright Fest. We saw dancers still rocking on stage at 10:00pm as we rode up the lift of hill of Nitro.\nAnother new entertainment addition this year is Slash, an illusionist that mixes gore and dark humor. Think \u201ctraditional magic show\u201d meets \u201chorror movie\u201d. The show is located in the Adventure Theater and is performed multiple times each evening. Its another great new use of Six Flags using their existing venues to add new entertainment.\nThe other noticeable change to the non uncharge events is The Awakening (a parade of ghosts and ghouls that starts the events as become more of an informal walking of the scare actors to each of their mazes. You can refer to our coverage last year of the event to see how the awakening was much more of a formal parade. The diminishing of this event might seem like a negative on paper, but it allows the scare actors to surprise guests in more organic nature; and they are all doing an amazing job of that this year. Scare actors seem to be hidden in nearly every public area.\n\u200bThe Manor- The manor is one of Great Adventures oldest attractions and like its sister maze Total Darkness is probably in need of retirement soon. These mazes do serve one singular purpose and that is allowing the mazes to open 3:00pm since this and the dark carnival are the only indoor mazes. While we enjoy both of these mazes we have noticed no changes or \u201cplussing\u201d to them in recent years.\nVoodoo Island- Voodoo Island Seemed really amped up this year with changes to make the maze seem more claustrophobic and added spots for the scare actors to really surprise you. This was easily the most improved maze this year.\nWaste Land- Waste Land remains another maze that has change little over the years. This year we were fortunate enough to have some of the most amazing scare actors which made a maze we typically aren\u2019t impressed by, a must do.\nBlood Shed - Best outdoor theming. Great scare actors. interesting layout. Since this is a relatively new maze we won\u2019t give away too many spoilers. But this is not to be missed.\nCell Block 6- If we had to give you just one reason to visit Fright Fest this year, it is the new maze Cell Block 6. Six Flags has truly outdone themselves with this prison themed maze. This maze is easily on the level of anything Universal has ever done. The scare actors are top notch, the theming is amazing, the layout is unprecedented. Do not miss this.\nOf course if all of these things seem a little too scary for you or the younger members of your party, there are numerous events during the day with no frights including a great Trick or Treat Trail, Dance Parties and Character Meet and Greets. There are also safe areas throughout the park if being scared isn\u2019t your cup of tea.\nWe've also got a few surprises ... first, we got an exclusive look at Justice League. It's not much more than dirt right now but thank you to the park for allowing us to get these awesome pics.\nLastly we thought we'd share some park photos since we don't have as many updates from this great park as we'd like."
