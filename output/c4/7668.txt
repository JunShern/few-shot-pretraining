    "text": "Here are some thoughts on the current situation at the University of South Carolina regarding fraternity recruitment. If you are unaware of the situation, you can read about it here. The University of South Carolina has suspended fraternity recruitment because of a series of alcohol-related incidents already this semester. I want to preface these thoughts by saying that I\u2019m fully aware I am an outsider to this. I only know and can react to what I\u2019ve read. I\u2019m sure all sides are trying their best.\nYet, there are three truths in life: death, taxes, and that 18-22 year-olds don\u2019t like being told what to do. I understand why the University felt they needed to act, and why they felt they needed to act swiftly. I really don\u2019t mind the decision, since it seems as though that community needs to step back and re-assess itself.\nThere is also something to be said about the courage of this decision. Backlash was certain. I always admire people and organizations strong enough to put their hand up and say \u201cenough.\u201d I have nothing against the administrators because I\u2019m sure they believe they are doing the right thing.\nI only wish the decision had been made differently. I only wish it was the students who were the ones saying \u201cenough.\u201d And I think it could have been.\nThe students need to change their behavior. There needs to be no alcohol in the recruitment process, and the emphasis on alcohol in fraternity life needs to be diminished. Those goals are noble and need to be pursued. However, I\u2019ve seen too many situations where the process to try and achieve goals such as these is a heavy-handed, top-down, parent-child approach. And it never seems to work.\nWhy are we surprised about the student reaction? Sure - some of their responses have been immature, but when people feel cornered or dismissed, they fight back. And often without logic.\nAccording to reports, university administrators had told student leaders in the Spring that things needed to change. Fair enough. What if they had instead worked with the Fraternity Council to form a group of staff/students to develop a strategic plan for alcohol-free recruitment? In my few years working with fraternities and sororities, I haven\u2019t really seen the Dean Wormer approach of \u201cshape up or else\u201d work very well. Although it is used extensively.\nAgain, this doesn\u2019t mean the university shouldn\u2019t have acted, or set high expectations for the fraternities. But if they wanted results - if they wanted a change in behavior - those expectations could have been matched with more guidance and support.\nAlso, according to reports, fraternities were informed of this decision by email. Do any of us like being given hard news by impersonal means? Hosting a meeting with leaders to tell them in person would have been better. They could have given the leaders the tools to communicate the decision back to their members (even though some still wouldn\u2019t have used them).\nThe students need to grow up and take ownership for this problem. They know it was there, and they\u2019ve been asleep at the wheel. Because of that, they have deferred much of their power over to the university administrators. The Fraternity Council should be ashamed of itself for how invisible it appears to be. However, if progress in this situation is for the students to take ownership again, I\u2019m cynical the current course of events will get us there.\nI can still remember my perspective as a fraternity undergraduate. I wanted us to captain our own ship, not just ride on one that was built for us.\nIt seems that as Greek professionals and university administrators get further away from the undergraduate years, they become more and more amazed that the students just don\u2019t get it. It\u2019s like we\u2019ve all pulled up rocking chairs on the front porch and are taking turns saying, \u201cthese kids today!\u201d These kids today aren\u2019t very different from kids their age across time. They will do the right thing, once they believe it\u2019s the right thing to do. They will also respond better to their peers rather than the town elders from Footloose.\nThere is defiance in the DNA of fraternities that goes all the way back to our founding. This has caused the relationship between us and our host institutions to be perpetually strained. That will probably never change. However, our approach as alumni and administrators can.\nIt will be interesting to watch this as it goes forward. I hope to see the Fraternity Council respond as partners in this problem and take a very active role in its solution. I also hope to see them regarded as such by the university administrators.\nAm I seeing this incorrectly? Feel free to comment below.\nAnd not feel any regret.\nBecause I\u2019ve done enough for now.\nNo one will miss me if I hole up here for a while.\nI can let the couch win.\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with a lazy day.\nBy the vast wasteland of 600 channels.\nPoker on ESPN, Jersey Shore on MTV.\nAnd enter an alternative video game world.\nI can blow things up.\nI can win the World Series.\nI can pretend that I\u2019m a rock legend.\nAnd stare out of this window.\nSit in a quiet and reflective state.\nThink about what I should do.\nBe lost in my thoughts.\nTurn back to reality TV.\nYet, lethargy is so draining.\nI can\u2019t just sit here, I can\u2019t just relax.\nI made a decision to do more.\nTo be a part of a movement.\nTo strive to be my best self.\nTo do more with my life.\nBut there are not enough of me.\nInto the weary face of a world that needs me.\nI could just sit here."
