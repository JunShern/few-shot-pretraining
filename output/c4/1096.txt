    "text": "A week after Bhartiya Janta Party won a historic mandate in the UP assembly elections, 2017, Yogi Adityanath was announced as the Chief Minister-designate. This announcement added even more to the buzz created by the victory of the saffron party in Uttar Pradesh.\nWe crawled the web (news websites + blogs) for the entire election period and came up with the following report.\nElections are always a matter of discussion but this time, the election of the CM of Uttar Pradesh is an even bigger deal. Yogi was announced as the CM-designate on 18th March and this news stole all the attention nationwide. You can see the graph inclining upwards in that duration. All the major publications had nearly the same news trending on the front page in both positive and negative context.\nA number of well-known publishers remained active and the list also includes the online lifestyle magazine for men, MensXP.\nFor the next insight from our analysis, we have generated a word cloud of digital media (news + blogs) keywords concerning Yogi, crawled from the beginning of the election season till the CM taking the oath. These words have been pulled out from the online media conversation regarding the subject of matter.\nAs you can see in the image, the most talked about topics revolved around the Babri Masjid controversy where Yogi Adityanath was a hardline advocate of the construction of Ram Mandir on the site. The other trending words included slaughterhouses that have been recently shut down on his orders along with other common topics of discussion during an election.\nThe alternate media also supports the positivity in the sentiment of people. A massive amount of tweets (nearly 76k) concerning Yogi Adityanath surfaced within a span of 2 days of him being announced as CM. The overall sentiment remained positive throughout.\nWith majority positive sentiment, we got mixed emotions with significant scores of the angry and funny emotions.\nUnlike the other buzzed up issues, this one had opinion-driven tweets mostly. Yogi\u2019s appointment as the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh was a lot for people to sink in with BJP already making a historical win. People expressed it all quite precisely on twitter.\nWe are introducing a new feature in this report where you can see the word distribution of the positive and negative tweets with their respective frequencies.\nThe BJP win and Yogi\u2019s appointment as the CM are certainly a huge reorientation in the political arena of Uttar Pradesh. People are looking forward to a better state and the government has 5 full years to bring a change and make that happen.\nWant to get an accurate analysis? Click here to schedule a free demo."
