    "text": "Resident Evil 2 remake is an upcoming survival horror game developed and published by Capcom. As a fan of the Resident Evil franchise, I was totally hyped for this game. After rushing through the demo, since it only allows players to play it for 30 minutes (Tip:Pausing the game stops the timer), I find the game to be thrilling and gory. There are a few nit picks, but it didn\u2019t ruin my overall experience with this one shot demo.\nAlong with the thrills, this game can get real gory (No surprise) I mean, look at the screen shots. Seeing a man get mauled in half by zombies or examining a zombie up close caused me to cringe a bit. The gore fits into the game play too, similar to Dead Space (Love this Franchise as well, DAMN YOU EA!) , I was able to disable a zombie by shooting at their limbs. For example, I accidentally shot a zombies arm as I was running away from it (Rushing the demo). The next time I saw the same zombie, its arm was dangling. (Not sure if it affects how it attack).\nA big step up from \u201cResident Evil 6\u201d (Didn\u2019t play Resident Evil 7, yet.) and a good fill in for that \u201cDead Space\u201d space in my heart. Totally looking forward to this game\u2019s release and Resident Evil fans should be too."
