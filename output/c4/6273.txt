    "text": "9. The Priest \u2013 We\u2019ve heard amazing things about this hike and we weren\u2019t disappointed. You can truly contemplate and appreciate nature while taking in the scenery at the top.\n8. McAfee Knob \u2013 This was our first time doing this hike, but I know we\u2019ll want to go back sometime. The summit gives you some amazing panoramic views.\n7. Hawksbill Summit Loop \u2013 We really enjoyed the ability to see the peregrine falcons and talk to one of the volunteers who has been monitoring their nest.\nThe Brown House (as opposed to the White House) is where President Hoover stayed.\n6. Mill Prong \u2013 Rapidan Camp \u2013 We had a wonderful time doing this hike. Wading across the stream and getting a private tour of President Hoover\u2019s retreat cabin made this a memorable trip.\n5. Mary\u2019s Rock \u2013 Starting our trail from the Jewell Hollow Overlook this time led to a wonderful ridge hike that made it much more enjoyable than previous trips.\nGorham Mountain's mix of mountain and ocean scenery makes the hike an annual favorite.\n4. Gorham Mountain \u2013 This hike we did in Acadia National Park. It is probably one of our all-time favorites and one we do every time we visit Maine. This time, we had a lot of fog move in right after we reached the summit, but it is one not to be missed.\n3. Mount Morgan \u2013 Mount Percival Trail \u2013 This trail we did on our visit to the White Mountains of New Hampshire. The hike included a lot of interesting hiking to include climbing a series of ladders and navigating a cave crawl-through on the way down. Great views. The only letdown was Christine got stung by some weird insect which caused her to not feel great on the way back.\n2. Cole (Cold) Mountain \u2013 This was a pleasant surprise to us. I had heard good things about the hike, but this blew away my expectations. Great views as you walk along the summit. It really helped that we had a great day for fall foliage.\n1. Mount Rogers \u2013 While we thought this day was going to be covered in fog, it turned out to be a marvelous hike. This hike is what gives Virginia Highlands its name \u2013 gorgeous views all along, varied terrain, and the bonus of wild ponies."
