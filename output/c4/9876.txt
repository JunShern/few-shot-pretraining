    "text": "A new study suggests that two sets of dynamics initiate and perpetuate the kinds of leaps of faith firefighters and others in high-risk occupations routinely take: supporting and sustaining.\nThe findings convey what goes into a person\u2019s ability to make critical trust-related judgments. The study also has relevance and managerial implications in an era of declining trust in both people and institutions, researchers say.\nFor the study, which appears in Administrative Science Quarterly, researchers studied firefighters who, in a high-stakes profession, have to take such leaps. Only around 4 percent of calls to a fire station are fire-related, so firefighters may not have seen their colleagues fight a fire. They may not even know them by reputation.\n\u201cWe found that firefighters take a leap of faith to move from weak evidence derived from mundane tasks and behaviors at the fire station to trust in terms of entering a burning building with other firefighters,\u201d the authors write.\nThe dynamics of support begin with knowing who is\u2014or isn\u2019t\u2014a good firefighter, the authors say. This knowledge is passed from one firefighter to another through stories that have to be clear enough to indicate a firefighter\u2019s trustworthiness. In this way, firefighters use cues at the firehouse\u2014how people look, act, and talk\u2014to determine how someone will act in a fire.\nGroups also need to be sure new information doesn\u2019t cause one person to constantly upend judgments about someone else, as that could make an already dangerous job more hazardous, the authors say.\nThus, firefighters also need sustaining dynamics that cut off or diminish new information and keep their judgments stable. These dynamics can also mean that firefighters who are initially categorized as untrustworthy aren\u2019t provided with many chances to prove otherwise.\nPast research has looked at the types of information that lead to trust, but because such information is rarely perfect or complete, trust always involves a leap of faith, the researchers say, adding that few previous studies have looked at how people do this.\nThrough a multiphase study of more than 60 firefighters in the US\u2014beginning with firefighters at stations in the Midwest and West Coast and narrowed to a single firefighting department in New England\u2014the authors explored processes that facilitate and maintain leaps of faith.\nAll but one of the firefighters were male, and they ranged in tenure from three months to 40 years. Nationally, firefighters are overwhelmingly male (96 percent) and white (82 percent), and 75 percent are between the ages of 32 and 50, according to the National Fire Protection Association.\nThrough interviews, observations and surveys, they asked about different types of firefighters (for example, those \u201cwith heart\u201d versus those \u201cworking for a paycheck\u201d), issues of trust, and how trust was assessed at the site of a fire. For example, the authors asked firefighters to describe colleagues they trusted and those they didn\u2019t, why they held those opinions and what concrete information they relied on as evidence of trustworthiness.\nThe authors lived at the station with the firefighters so they could observe them performing daily routines, such as grocery shopping, preparing and eating meals, conducting inspections, and responding to calls.\nSimilar trust dynamics are likely to be found in occupations where there is not a lot of direct information about another person, such as bodyguards or nuclear power plant emergency operators, the researchers say. But because work relationships can be complex, one person might never really have all of the direct evidence needed to judge a colleague.\nFor example, the researchers say it may be difficult for employers to gain direct evidence that employees won\u2019t embezzle from them. One needs to take a leap of faith.\nThis is likely true for most of a person\u2019s strong personal relationships as well. Leaps of faith are also important at the beginning of a relationship, when the participants don\u2019t have any direct evidence.\nTrust can be strongly influenced by company culture, the authors say. The stories and values in an organization shape who will\u2014and will not\u2014be trusted. For these stories and values to be useful in strengthening trust, they need to be sustained such that employees come to see evidence that supports the story.\nThe authors stress that those who are or aren\u2019t trusted might not be determined by what they actually do, but by the categories that people fit others into. This means bias in trust is real.\n\u201cTrust comprises both knowledge and faith. Although we know much about the role of the former, faith has remained rather inscrutable,\u201d the authors say.\n\u201cWe shed light on the dynamics that allow members of an occupation to accept the uncertainty inherent to trust and to maintain a willingness to be vulnerable despite not knowing when or whether they will ever observe the trustee perform in the task domain\u2014and in this case, a high-risk domain."
