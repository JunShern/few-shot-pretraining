    "text": "There is a blurred line between a web developer and a web designer, and probably that\u2019s why you\u2019d want to read this article!\nI\u2019ve concocted a helpful quiz for you below, near the ending of this article, should you wish to try it out!\nWeb developers, well \u2014 develop \u2014 whilst web designers create mockups through Photoshop or Illustrator or Sketch, right?\nNot so easy, considering that Web Developers know Photoshop as well, and Web Designers know how to use Git.\nSo, it must be that one or the other delve deeper into their technical sides.\nThe above are qualities and skills that are present in both a web developer and a web designer. Since working in a web or digital company, both of these roles are interchangeable, but sooner or later one will have to take a route on which they feel more comfortable with.\nThe web designer will feel more comfortable with getting the whole picture of visual and interactive design in good working order \u2014 pixel perfection \u2014 as soon as they get a good grasp of how a website functions.\nWeb Designer: This Twitter feed found in the footer should update itself in realtime, instead of the user having to refresh their browser to see the latest tweets, please.\nWeb Developer: Sure, I\u2019m going to add this to the to-do list of that website. I can implement this in 20 minutes!\nYou will realise in the conversation above that both designer and developer understand how the Twitter feed works. Yet, one of them was responsible for thinking of putting the Twitter feed there in a design layout, and another one is responsible for making it happen on a real website.\nAs a Web Designer, you\u2019ll love putting out amazing works of art, that thousands of people use and will make their day even better as they interact with your art.\nIf it makes you smile with joy, then surely it will make the audience smile as well!\nYou put your heart and mind into it. Period.\nIf that\u2019s enticing enough for you to become a web designer, what more could you ask? Yes, you could even work as a team of web designers who perform handiworks to brainstorm designs creatively, which is absolutely fun!\nThe web developer, however, is the person who loves to hold the nitty and gritty info, make it simple to understand, and convey it to people so that the discussion doesn\u2019t go way too far off on the developer side. This is an attribute of Mastery, which we will discuss below.\nI\u2019m sure you tick all the boxes for what gets you driven or motivated \u2014 that could include Mating \u2014 but if you think deep enough or what gets your attention the most, what would it be?\nBecause as a Web Developer, one of you heartfelt M\u2019s of motivation would be Mastery and/or Material.\nLike, who wouldn\u2019t want to have the shiniest and greatest technology? That\u2019s Material.\nOr, who wouldn\u2019t want to be their own boss, keeping their actions intentional, and owning their agenda? That\u2019s Mastery.\nAnd as web developers, it is easy to be code monkeys of the 21st century, but I know that as you read this article, you understand to stay away from being a code monkey. It isn\u2019t nice in the first place!\nAm I a web designer or a web developer?\nI have a quiz below which should help guide you on whether you would love being either a web developer or a web designer, even if you are either one already!\nAre you a Web Developer or a Web Designer?\nIf you still feel like you need proofing before you get out into the field and plot your route even firmer, see the quotes below.\nAll web developers are masters of the art of semantics. They have to be detailed-oriented and passionate about structure and semantics.\nA Web Developer to me is someone who understands how a website needs to integrate with a backend service whether it be a database, flat file, service API endpoint.\nA great web/graphics designer Knows the perfect balance between usability and beautiful graphics. He/She also knows the design process is always user-centred and not ego-centred.\nA Web Designer to me is someone who understands how a website is put together. They are able to take resources (images, scripts, stylesheets, documents) and create or configure the markup to produce an end result.\nBoth web developers and designers have things in common, but one or the other is responsible for more technical work on their side.\nThey both look up to each other as having similar knowledge, so that the ties between technical conversations are clearly understood.\nBut with that said it\u2019s very common for them to flip around their job roles, but at the end of the day it\u2019s up to them to decide what profession describes them more \u2014 on a personal level as well.\nFinding out which one you may be is a simple decision, but a tough one. Where you\u2019ll have to ask a question to yourself on which one suits you better. However, this isn\u2019t a black-or-white decision but instead a weighted decision.\nThe bottom line is: choose what you\u2019re more comfortable with, and stick with that. If it doesn\u2019t fare as much, you can always nudge a little to the opposite side and see how things go well for you. Sooner or later you\u2019ll get a good understanding of your own likings, and choose what fits best for you!"
