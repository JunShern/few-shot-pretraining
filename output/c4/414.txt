Penginapan ini juga terletak dalam jarak berjalan kaki yang singkat dari tarikan-tarikan yang ditawarkan di Fira yang termasuk Pusat Persidangan Nomikos yang berjarak hanya 50 meter jauhnya.\nKaunter penerimaan tetamu dibuka dari jam 07:30 hingga 21:00.\nClean and generally comfortable. However, check in was late at around 2pm despite official check in time at 12pm. Breakfast was served late despite indicated at 9am. Breakfast was not ready at 10am and we decided to go out and eat.\nin general this place had value for the money spent. cozy room with great view of the ocean and surrounding islands. decent breakfast of yogurt with honey, egg, pastries, and eggs accompanied by decent coffee/juice. if you are looking for \"luxury\" however, this place is not for you, it more to enjoy the view and clean comfortable place to sleep.\nThe rooms are small and fairly old and there are no facilities of any note. The staff are friendly and the location is great.\nThe hotel was a big disappointment. It started with the terrace (which looked very nice in the pictures) being totally neglected with furniture thrown over etc. Also the whole hotel smells of stale smoke and the rooms, especially the ones at the top, are shabby and not too clean.\nSantorini is expensive, but this place was certainly the cheapest we could find. The rooftop terrace is the best part, the sunsets from here are great. The morning breakfast was also very good. The only thing we didn't like was the jacuzzi, it didn't look clean and also we read we had free airport transfers but she made us pay 10 EUR per person to use this service. Overall though, you are in a great location and can walk to anywhere.\nWe stay at the room with balcony. The view is superb.. Maria is very helpful and nice to us. The breakfast is perfectly served too. I don't mind to come back and stay at the same place when i go to Santorini in the future..\nNice location on the caldera. Very nice view of the sea not much view of the caldera. But best place to see the sunset from the roof top.\nGood location to see cliff & fair price for the room. Difficult to find the location of apartment.\nI would like to say \"Thank you, Maria\"!!! Best staff at Kafieris Apts, best view to Imerovigli & Fira.\nBreakfast was AWESOME!!! Staff was friendly and location is alright as you can just park your car up front. Shower is small and the bathroom is smelly tho. Overall we had a good time at Kafieris.\nThe location, price, view, and service were excellent!\nI spent my birthday at this hotel and it was amazing. The view from roof in the morning and at sunset was unbelievable! It overlooks Skaros rock and the Agios Theodori church is right next door. Would definitely stay here again!"
