    "text": "\"For excellent service as a squad leader in a Marine rifle company during operations against the enemy on IWO JIMA, VOLCANO ISLANDS, on February 19, 1945. When his platoon sergeant was wounded on the beach and his platoon leader pinned down by enemy fire , Sergeant LEWIS assumed the duties of platoon sergeant and reorganized his platoon while subject to intense enemy fire and completely disregarding his own safety. This quick reoganization permitted his platoon to be committed immediately on the right flank of the battalion where it was needed. His courage and conduct throughout were in keeping with the highest tradition of the United States Naval Service.\""
