    "text": "US Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein has denied a report that he discussed invoking a constitutional clause to oust President Donald Trump.\nAmerica\u2019s second most senior law official said the allegation was \u201cinaccurate and factually incorrect\u201d.\nThe New York Times, citing anonymous sources, also said Mr Rosenstein had suggested secretly recording Mr Trump to expose chaos in the White House.\nBut a source told the BBC that the comment was sarcastic.\nMr Rosenstein is reported to have made the remarks after Mr Trump fired the FBI director last year.\nJames Comey had been overseeing his law enforcement agency\u2019s investigation into alleged ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. Mr Trump referred to the \u201cRussia thing\u201d when asked why he was removed.\nMr Trump told a rally in Missouri on Friday evening that there was a \u201clingering stench\u201d about what was being exposed at the US Justice Department.\nHe said he would get rid of it just as his administration \u201chad gotten rid of bad people at the FBI\u201d.\nThe 25th Amendment: Could it be used to unseat Trump?\nThe New York Times reported that Mr Rosenstein had discussed recruiting cabinet members to invoke the 25th amendment of the US constitution, which provides for the removal of a president if he is deemed unfit for office.\nIt also says he suggested secretly recording Mr Trump to expose White House turmoil and dysfunction.\nThe suggestions came during meetings and conversations in May 2017 with Department of Justice and FBI officials, the paper said.\nIt cited several unnamed sources who were briefed on the events.\nAccording to US media, the source of the allegations are memos created by former FBI acting director Andrew McCabe, who was fired by Mr Trump in March this year.\nMr McCabe\u2019s lawyer, Michael Bromwich, said his client \u201chas no knowledge of how any member of the media obtained those memos\u201d.\nMr Bromwich said the memos had been submitted to the special counsel who is investigating possible Russian meddling in the 2016 election and obstruction of justice, and that another copy had remained with the FBI.\nHow did Mr Rosenstein respond?\nThe deputy attorney general issued a statement saying: \u201cThe New York Times\u2019s story is inaccurate and factually incorrect.\n\u201cI will not further comment on a story based on anonymous sources who are obviously biased against the department and are advancing their own personal agenda.\nA justice department press officer told the BBC that Mr Rosenstein\u2019s comment about secretly recording the president was a joke.\nThe statement was attributed to \u201ca source who was in the room\u201d and was said to remember the exchange in question.\n\u201cThe statement was sarcastic and was never discussed with any intention of recording a conversation with the president,\u201d the unnamed source said.\nThe spokesperson did not immediately reply to an emailed question asking if the 25th amendment was discussed during that meeting.\nIn other US media, there was scepticism that the US deputy attorney general would earnestly propose ousting the president.\nActivating the relevant section of the 25th amendment would require a majority of Mr Trump\u2019s cabinet, the vice-president and majorities in Congress, which is currently controlled by the president\u2019s party.\nThe Washington Post also reported that Mr Rosenstein\u2019s remark about surreptitious recordings was not serious.\nThe newspaper said the deputy attorney general had been responding to Andrew McCabe\u2019s suggestion that the justice department investigate the president.\nThe newspaper also said that someone who was present at the meeting denied the 25th amendment had ever come up.\nDonald Trump has spent a lot of time disparaging \u201cfake news\u201d reports from the \u201cfailing\u201d New York Times largely based on anonymous sources. It will be interesting to see how he responds to an article that seemingly confirms his suspicions that members of his own administration are out to get him.\nOr maybe they\u2019re not. It all depends on whether you believe sources who talked to people who were in the room when Rod Rosenstein reportedly entertained notions of secretly taping the president or organising a constitutional manoeuvre to remove Mr Trump from office.\nOn some level, it doesn\u2019t matter if the reports are true. They alter events and perceptions either way. Mr Rosenstein has been on thin ice with the president for so long his feet probably have frostbite. The New York Times story could be the ominous crack that presages a plunge into the cold abyss.\nGiven Mr Rosenstein\u2019s position overseeing Robert Mueller and the Russia probe, any move against him by the president would be fraught with political peril. The president has vowed that he won\u2019t make a decision about Jeff Sessions until after the mid-term elections in November. Would that reluctance extend to the attorney general\u2019s second in command?\n9 May 2017 \u2013 Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein submits a memo to the attorney general regarding FBI boss James Comey\u2019s investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s handling of classified documents. President Trump fires Mr Comey, and Andrew McCabe becomes acting director of the FBI.\n11 May 2017 \u2013 Mr Rosenstein denies that he threatened to quit after being described as a key influence in Mr Comey\u2019s firing. The New York Times says Mr McCabe\u2019s memos from around this time note that Mr Rosenstein was upset and wished Mr Comey was still at the FBI.\n16 May 2017 \u2013 Mr Rosenstein met Mr McCabe and other senior officials to explain his role in Mr Comey\u2019s firing. He reportedly said he was frustrated with Mr Trump, suggested wearing a \u201cwire\u201d to secretly record the president during White House visits, and discussed invoking the 25th amendment to oust Mr Trump for being \u201cunfit\u201d for office, the New York Times reported on Friday.\n17 May 2017 \u2013 Mr Rosenstein appoints Robert Mueller as special counsel, tasked with overseeing the Russia investigation.\n17 March 2018 \u2013 Mr McCabe is fired by Mr Trump a day before his planned 18 March retirement. He had stepped down from his FBI role amid relentless criticism from Mr Trump.\n30 May 2018 \u2013 US media report that Mr McCabe handed over a confidential memo on Mr Comey\u2019s firing \u2013 which reportedly details his conversation with Mr Rosenstein \u2013 to the special counsel.\n26 July 2018 \u2013 After the Justice Department rejects a request to release Mr McCabe\u2019s memos, conservatives in the House of Representatives file articles of impeachment in an effort to oust Mr Rosenstein, accusing him of stonewalling their requests for information, which he denies."
