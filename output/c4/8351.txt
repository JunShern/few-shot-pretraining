    "text": "Here is a link to a sample letter in PDF format.\nI live near the Lytton land in or near the town of Windsor, Sonoma County, California. I will be very negatively impacted if HR 597 moves land into trust for the Lytton.\nRep. Jeff Denham is not my representative. He does not represent my district. His district is 150 miles away. He has received +$80,000 in contributions from the Lytton.\nThis bill is a Carcieri-fix for the Lytton. They already have an open 2009 Bureau of Indian Affairs application. The Lytton were not a tribe in 1934, per Carcieri v. Salazar, the Department of the Interior lacks the authority to put their land into trust.\nThis bill would enable the Lytton to flout local zoning. The housing listed on this bill is non-compliant. Their documented plans for large commercial development (200 room hotel, 200,000 case a year winery) are not even mentioned in the bill.\nThe 2016 Congressional Report 114-633 for H.R. 2538 states that \u201cthe Natural Resources Committee has received a relatively large number of communications from the residents of Windsor, California in opposition to the bill.\u201d I still oppose HR 2538 and HR597.\nPlease listen to my concerns and do not approve HR597.\nA poll conducted by Probolsky Research from Newport Beach CA regarding Windsor residents\u2019 opinion on Lytton Rancheria Homelands Act of 2017 was recently completed. Here is a link to the Complete Document.\nFor details see the Recommended Books page.\nOur Windsor City Council are not representing our community in that they are making decisions without our input. They have had 15 closed door meetings with the Lytton\u2019s in order to make a deal with them regarding our community, all without a discussion with the citizens. We elected them. We are their constituents. They work for us.\nA couple of things jump out from these excerpts. One is that that \u201cThe Lytton Band of Pomo Indians\u2026appears to have been invented in order to open a bingo hall.\u201d. Another is section points out that in 1990, the Lytton\u2019s had 20 members. Yet in 2005, they claimed to have 275.\nMitchell on Lytton Click on blue link to the left to read the chapter.\nTell your neighbors, friends and co-workers about our website! Email it!

There is nothing anyone can do about it.\n3) The fact that they already have a 9.5-acre reservation in San Pablo, and their homeland, according to the Attorney General Kamala Harris, should now be considered Contra Costa County.\nHere is just a small portion of the beautiful land, trees and views we are fighting to keep.\nJared Huffman Letter to Councilman Foppoli \u2013 More Misinformation!\nJared Huffman continues to spread misinformation about the Lytton project.
