    "text": "Hanukkah Menorah Craft Using Recycled Cereal Box Cardboard!\nI have been busy making the cutest Hanukkah menorahs ever, using cereal box cardboard and a template that I'm planning to have in my shop any day now. The month before Hanukkah is always super crazy for me, and while the template isn't 100% ready, I did want to put the idea out there for those who are thinking about getting serious with the holiday preparations.\nThese cardboard menorahs can be made in a few sizes and they are equally great as centerpieces or displayed around the house. I have a bunch on my piano right now and it looks fabulous!\nAnd if you'd like to make a cardboard menorah that is larger than a cereal box, well I did that too, using chip board, and the results are so much fun!\nIf you'd like me to shoot you an email when the template and tutorial are in my shop, just leave me a comment and I'll be more than happy to do so!"
