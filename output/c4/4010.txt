Now her friends and family in Wyoming, Ill., are honoring the sacrifice she made to save her newborn daughter, reports KWQC. Carter, who had just turned 21 on Sunday, was alone with her baby Monday morning when their house went up in flames. The local fire chief says Carter strapped Keana into a car seat and dropped her from an upstairs window, saving her life. \"You put yourself in that situation and you know it wouldn't be easy,\" says Stacy Unhold, a family friend. Carter was found near an upstairs window, and an autopsy determined she died of smoke inhalation.\nVery brave of this woman and proves a mother's love and sacrifice! Sadly, many other stories out there are about horrid women that do the most evil to their own children!\nIt's possible flames from first story kept her from jumping herself. She might have been able to toss her newborn far enough away from the house, but then was scared to jump herself if flames were directly below her. Maybe the windowsill was too hot to climb out of? I don't know, but it was definitely an incredible, selfless act thinking quickly to protect her daughter as best as she could.\nMedal of Freedom Award.
