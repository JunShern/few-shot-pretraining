To do so I've built several phylogenetic trees (single-gene: 18s SSU, 28s LSU, ITS and multi-gene: ITS + 28s LSU + RPB2). Data set for such analysis contained sequences from two orders (BLAST search showed affiliation with this two orders). Topology of trees tells that target strain may be a new species or may be insertae sedis.\nWhat kind of analysis should be performed in order to proof that target strain is a new species or may be insertae sedis or none of that?\nOne of the multi-gene trees for one of the orders is shown on picture."
