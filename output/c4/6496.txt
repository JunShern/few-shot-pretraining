We get a lot of compliments on our imaginative lunches \u2013 making them something to look forward to as well!\nWe should finish our hike around 4 pm, giving you time to wash up, relax at the hotel, visit the pool and spa, or perhaps do a bit of shopping in town. All of our hotels on this tour have great facilities and gorgeous pool and spa areas, so we\u2019ll look forward to having time each day to enjoy those.

We\u2019ll stay in the 4-star Hotel Doldenhorn, a lovely chalet-style hotel on the outskirts of the village with a new pool and spa and gourmet meals.\nKandersteg \u2013 One of the must-see hikes in the region starts with a gondola ride up to the Oeschinensee lake, an emerald-green jewel of a lake, surrounded on three sides by mountains.\nCowbells jingle and waterfalls plunge over dramatic cliffs into the lake below. Hike up above the lake for bird\u2019s-eye views through meadows and forest on a scenic loop back to Kandersteg, where we return to our hotel for a second night.\nLeukerbad \u2013 Hike over the historic Gemmi pass on a mellow approach trail beneath the pyramidal Balmhorn and Altels peaks.\nViews of the Valaisian Alps to the south spur us on as we wind our way down the serpentine mule-path to the village of Leukerbad, where we stay in an elegant 3-star hotel and enjoy a relaxing soak in one of the town\u2019s thermal baths. Convenient cable cars can be utilized for an easy hike.\nZermatt \u2013 After breakfast, we\u2019ll say good-bye to Leukerbad, and travel a few hours to nearby Zermatt.
