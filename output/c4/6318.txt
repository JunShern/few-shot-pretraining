I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s their delicious taste, their appearance or just the fact they\u2019re not that complicated to prepare.\nEither way, Stuffed Bell Peppers can serve as a side dish or as the main meal. That makes them double handy.\nI cut the tops off of 3 bell peppers and removed the excess membrane and ribs. Be sure to put the bell pepper in a pan of water to parboil before making stuffed peppers otherwise the pepper will still be a bit crisp and not easily cut with a fork. Make sure the peppers are covered by water and boil for 5 minutes, drain and set aside.\nI took the bell pepper tops and minced finely. I put my skillet on medium heat, added 2 tablespoons of Canola oil and added \u00be cup minced bell pepper and saut\u00e9 for 3 minutes. Next I added \u00bc cup minced onions and 1 tablespoon dried parsley and saut\u00e9ed another 2 minutes. Last I added 1 tablespoon minced garlic and saut\u00e9ed for about 30 seconds more. You have to be sure to keep stirring this so you don\u2019t let it burn, especially when the garlic is added. I turned off heat.\nI added 1 can (14.5 ounces, about 1 \u00bd cups) petit diced tomatoes to the mixture. I didn\u2019t drain the tomatoes because the rice I\u2019ll add soon will absorb the extra liquid. I turned the skillet on to simmer.\nNext I added \u00bd tablespoon of fresh homemade dried oregano (you can use bought dried herbs) and \u00bd tablespoon of fresh homemade dried basil to the mix. I continued to stir and let the mixture simmer. I added 1 \u00bd cups of cooked rice (I used instant rice). The rice marries with all the flavors and absorb the liquids. Next I added 1 \u00bd teaspoons fresh ground kosher salt, a \u00bc teaspoon fresh ground black pepper and 2 cups cooked ground pork.\nThe cooked ground pork was 4 leftover cooked boneless pork chops that I sliced and put into the food processor. I used 2 cups of the pork for the stuffing and still had another 2 cups left to use in another dish later.\nI continued to stir as the mixture simmered for about 7 to 10 more minutes.\nRemoving the mixture from the stove, I placed it in a large bowl. Even though this is a stuffing mixture I concocted for the stuffed bell peppers, you could stop at this stage (add the cheese, if desired) and eat it as it is. It would go good on a bed of spinach. Just don\u2019t add the eggs if you\u2019re not going to cook it any further.\nI added \u00bd cup Kraft shredded mild cheddar cheese and 2 large eggs (beaten) into the mixture. Once the mixture was blended thoroughly, I spooned it into the bell peppers. There was enough stuffing for 4 large bell peppers. I placed the peppers in casserole dish and baked them for 45 minutes in a pre-heated 350 degree oven.\nThese aromatic Stuffed Bell Peppers are delicious and easy to prepare. The stuffing is moist and flavorful.\nThanks for visiting today. If you decide to try this recipe, be sure to stop back by and let me know how it turned out or if you post it online just tag it with #thesurprisedgourmet. I\u2019d sure like to know how it turned out.\nStuffed Bell Peppers make a delicious side dish or a savory main meal.\nCut tops off the 3 bell peppers and remove the excess membrane and ribs. Put the bell pepper in a pan of water making sure the peppers are covered by water. Boil for 5 minutes, drain and set aside.\nTake the tops of the peppers and mince finely.

Add \u00bd cup Kraft shredded mild cheddar cheese and 2 beaten large eggs into the mixture. Once the mixture is blended thoroughly, spoon into the bell peppers. Should stuff about 4 large bell peppers. Place in casserole dish and bake 45 minutes in preheated 350 degree oven.\n*Ground pork can be made from 4 cooked boneless pork chops that have been sliced and put into the food processor. There will be more than 2 cups of the ground pork after placed in the food processor.\n**Even though this is a stuffing mixture concocted for the stuffed bell peppers, you could stop at this stage before you add the eggs and eat it as it is. It would go good on a bed of spinach.\nWith summer quickly drawing to an end and fall activities gearing up, it\u2019s always good to have a couple of tasty side dishes you can prepare at a moments\u2019 notice.\nToday I want to share two dishes that are hits at our house. One is a longtime favorite and the other is one I came up with when I started out to make a salsa.\nThe longtime favorite is cole slaw and the new favorite is a delicious take on guacamole.\nThe guacamole dip came about this way. I had 2 avocados that weren\u2019t as ripe as I had hoped, but I decided to use them anyway. I seeded, peeled, chopped and mashed them.\nNext I added 1 teaspoon of onion powder, 3 teaspoons of lime juice, 1 teaspoon of Lawry\u2019s Garlic salt, 1/4 cup of mayonnaise and 1/2 teaspoon cumin. These ingredient amounts came about a little at a time as I added, tasted and then added a little more.\nUsing a hand-held immersion blender I pureed all the ingredients together into a smooth and creamy mixture. This became perfect for a dip. In fact, the texture of the mixture is so creamy you could use it on sandwiches, hamburgers or hot dogs to replace mayonnaise or mustard if you wanted to.\nTake 2 large avocados - seed, peel, chop and mash them.\nAdded 1 teaspoon of onion powder, 3 teaspoons of lime juice, 1 teaspoon of Lawry's Garlic salt, \u00bc cup of mayonnaise and \u00bd teaspoon cumin.\nUsing a hand-held immersion blender, puree all the ingredients together into a smooth and creamy mixture. This becomes perfect for a dip. In fact, the texture of the mixture is so creamy you can use it on sandwiches, hamburgers or hot dogs to replace mayonnaise or mustard if you desire.\nCole slaw is a great side dish that goes well with hamburgers and hot dogs. But is also makes a tasty side dish for full meals.\nTaking a half of a medium head of cabbage, I chopped it up into pieces that would fit into the chute of my food processor. Next I peeled one large carrot. I put the cabbage and carrot through the shredding disc of the food processor creating a fine looking texture similar to angel hair cole slaw you would find in a grocery store.\nPlacing the cabbage and carrot mixture in a large bowl, I added 1 tablespoon of dried parsley and 2 teaspoons of celery seed.\nUsing a jar with a lid, I mixed 2 tablespoons of sugar, 3 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar and 1 cup of mayonnaise shaking the jar until the ingredients were well blended. Then I poured the dressing mixture over the cabbage ingredients until I got the desired moisture consistency I wanted, stirring well as I added. By mixing the dressing separately, you can adjust it to make the cole slaw as moist or dry as you prefer. The cole slaw comes out with a creamy, tangy taste.\nTo make the dressing mixture I used a mayonnaise jar, but a mason jar with a lid will work too. The cole slaw (covered tightly) will keep well in the refrigerator for several days.\nDo you have any favorite side dishes that you can prepare at a moment\u2019s notice? Do you have a favorite guacamole dip recipes?\nHomemade cole slaw goes great with hamburgers and hot dogs or a full meal.\nTake a half of a medium head of cabbage, chop it into pieces that will fit into a food processor chute. Next peel one large carrot. Run the cabbage and carrot through the shredding disc of the food processor for an angel hair-type texture.\nPlace the cabbage and carrot mixture in a large bowl, Add 1 tablespoon of dried parsley and 2 teaspoons of celery seed.\nUsing a jar with a lid, mix 2 tablespoons of sugar, 3 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar and 1 cup of mayonnaise shaking the jar until the ingredients are well blended. Then pour the dressing mixture over the cabbage ingredients until you have the consistency you want, stirring as you go. Covered tightly the cole slaw keeps well in the refrigerator for a couple of days."
