    "text": "Tyrannodorkus is an avid gamer and enthusiast with a focus on MMOs.\nIf you\u2019re confused by the title, it\u2019s an old term from my Everquest 1 days. It\u2019s not a misspelled word like boom, loom, or doom\u2026 although oom seems to be attached to pretty negative words. It\u2019s an acronym for \u2018out of mana\u2019, or \u2018out of magic\u2019. That means your group better be careful lest their cleric can\u2019t heal, or their illusionist can\u2019t control a crowd of monsters.\nWhy do I feel out of juice though? My job has basically went into a highly suggested overtime period from the day I started. It didn\u2019t really effect me so much, but my brother works the say area and we car pool, so I sort of am doing overtime anyways. And my brother is a work-o-holic, and he likes to make plans, and he drags takes me to the gym. I don\u2019t even get to touch a game except for the weekends, if those days don\u2019t have stuff planned for them. I\u2019m at least financially independent again, so I get the good with the bad. It\u2019s not his fault or anything, it\u2019s just that\u2019s how our situation happens to be at the moment.\nBecause of all this, I don\u2019t get time to recharge my batteries. If you took the MBTI personality test, you may understand what an intj, and intp might be, specifically the \u2018i\u2019 part. Of all the letters, I stayed close to the center so I could kind of go one way or the other, except for \u2018i\u2019. The \u2018i\u2019 stands for introvert, which many of my fellow bloggers and video game enthusiasts typically are. I tested pretty extreme for introvert both times taking the test and what that means is I need a lot of personal time and quiet to help keep my mental and physical energy up. Conversely, extroverts gain energy from lots of socializing and having the spotlight. So my energy reserves are pretty much empty.\nOne of the best ways I\u2019ve heard how introverts work is from Pyschochild explaining what he heard from NPR. People may see us like we are removed from the world, but what really happens is that we can\u2019t shut off the world. It\u2019s hard for us to be in highly energetic environments with lots of input to our senses, we can\u2019t filter it very well. That is why we like quiet, and getting out of the spotlight.\nIf you made it this far, then I can only assume you like me and what I write (hey I like you too) or may be in the same, or similar situation and can\u2019t find time to energize. I truly sympathize with you if you do, but have this silly image below. I don\u2019t know what it is yet since I haven\u2019t made it, but it\u2019ll be the best thing ever going through a long post like this.
