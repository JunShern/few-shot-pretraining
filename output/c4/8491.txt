    "text": "Over the summer my son is focusing on play but I am focusing on working on his fine motor skills. This activity satisfies both . The best part of these letter puzzles are how adaptable they are. You can make letters, shapes, even spell simple words. You could provide your child with a card next to each group of pegs to let them know what letter it is or leave it as a puzzle for them to figure out like I did to combine fine motor and spacial skills.\nGather your materials. You will need a cork board , some pushpins and elastics.\nStart by stretching two elastics across the board to make 4 distinct areas.\nUsing the push pins I created 4 letters. I wanted to make sure that they could be made into letters so created them myself. Then removed the elastics and called my son.\nHe dove right in. The A was easy but the B was tricky. It took a while for him to see that it was a B but once he did he couldn\u2019t make the B fast enough.\nI took all the pegs out ( adults only if you aren\u2019t careful the elastics can pull the pegs out and they go flying) and reconfigured them into 4 new letters. These were easier and he flew through them but he was still getting lots of opportunity to fine tune his fine motor skills.\nThese books aren\u2019t your basic alphabet book. They offer challenges that will appeal to school age children but could still be shared with kids 5 and under.\nAnimalia by Graeme Base is iconic in teaching circles, you can loose yourself for hours in the detailed illustrations. The book is an alphabet book on steroids! Each page had a wonderful paragraph in each letter such as for the letter L \u201d\u009d Lazy Lions lounging in the local library.\u201d\u009d The pages are filled to the gills with pictures of things that start with that letter as well. Parents and kids a like will fall in love.\nAll Aboard!: A Traveling Alphabet by Bill Mayer was more fun for my husband and I than for my son when he was a toddler, but that\u201d\u2122s not a bad thing. It\u201d\u2122s a book of pictures, with hidden letters in them. For example the letter O is overpass with loops of road and hidden in it is an O. Some letters were easy to find some were hilariously hard. We read this to my son tonight at bedtime and while we stared at the letter H ( highway) picture debating where the h was, he fell asleep between us in his bed. This is a great alphabet book for families with children just learning and those who have mastered the alphabet. Oh and the debate was settled , we were both wrong. The final page highlights the letter in each picture in a compilation of the whole alphabet.\nAl Pha\u201d\u2122s Bet by Amy Krouse Rosenthal is a rare find. An alphabet book that can keep a 5 year old who says alphabet books are for babies, completely engaged. The story follows Al who has bet himself that he can win a contest ordered by the King figure out an order for the brand new 26 letters that were just invented. In a string of adorable events and a little chance the alphabet as we know it is put together. My son thought it was hysterical that P was put in the line up after Al went pee. It\u201d\u2122s a cute idea for a book and abstract enough to be a bit of a challenge for preschoolers but just the right level of interest for kids that think they know it all when it comes to the alphabet.\nLove this idea and the book suggestions. Another one of my advanced ABC favorites is Q is for Duck. For each letter there is a riddle that invites some critical thinking to go along with the general alphabet practice. Thanks for sharing!\nLove this idea! Very tactile and fun for kids learning the alphabet!\nThank you for a creative and fun learning activity!"
