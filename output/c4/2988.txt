As much as I love Jimmy Fallon, Seth Meyers and Stephen Colbert, post-11:30 p.m. TV would be a lot...quieter (and tamer) without Handler.\nTo my relief, Handler just announced her next move, and it's a big one\u2014the comedienne is headed to Netflix, where she'll launch an on-demand new talk show in 2016. Obviously, that's not nearly soon enough, so, to tide us over, she's airing a stand-up special based on her latest book, \u201cUganda Be Kidding Me,\u201d on October 16, and a series of docu-specials, tacking topics from NASCAR and politics to the NBA draft and Silicon Valley, throughout 2015. I mean, who does't want to hear Handler riff on Nascar?\nIt should be super interesting to see how Handler's new show fares on a network that's made it's name on binge-watching (try to tell me you didn't watch all of Orange Is The New Black or House of Cards in one go, I dare you). Obviously, the talk shows as we know them are meant to be watched nightly, as a reaction to the news of the day. Will people start tuning in to Netflix as if it was just another channel, or will people end up watching old news on demand? Late night TV has already seen a ton of shake-ups this year (see: Fallon, Meyers and Colbert), but, if anyone could take a step further, my money's on Handler."
