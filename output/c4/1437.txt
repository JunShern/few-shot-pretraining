    "text": "Ford UK announced that the 2008 Focus ST will officially go on sale from May 1. Created by the performance vehicle division TeamRS the new ST is powered by the 2.5-liter engine which delivers 225 hp and is capable to sprint from 0-100 km/h in just 6.8 seconds while the top speed is limited to 240 km/h.\nFord added three levels of equipping: The ST comes with 18\u201d wheels, Recaro sport buckets, unique sport steering wheel, with the new \u201eFord Power\u201d starter button and Easyfuel capless refuelling system. The ST-2 has also a Sony audio system, bi-xenon lights, LED rear lights and Quickclear heated windscreen while the ST-3 includes a full leather trim plus an in-dash six CD player. For all the ST fans, the vehicle also set a segment-leading record of 8min 35sec at the Nurburgring race track.\nFast, fun and fabulously good looking, a new version of Ford\u2019s the performance flagship Focus goes on sale at dealerships across Great Britain from May 1. Created by Ford TeamRS, the company\u2019s dedicated performance vehicle arm, the 2008 Focus ST benefits from the new exterior and interior styling changes introduced across the rest of the Focus line-up earlier this year. Importantly though, while offering new technologies and features, the car\u2019s well-honed dynamics remain untouched.\nAt the heart of the matter is the familiar 225 PS, 2.5-litre turbocharged five-cylinder Duratec engine. Powerful, and accompanied by a suitably sporty soundtrack, this powerhouse delivers a potential 150mph top speed in tandem with 0-62mph acceleration in just 6.8 seconds.\nIndeed, as a measure of this car\u2019s ability, a standard production Focus ST set a segment-leading record time of 8 minutes 35 seconds around the Nordschleife circuit at the famed N\u00fcrburgring.\nThis sort of achievement requires more than just brute power and the Focus ST remains one of the sharpest handling cars in its class. In fact, the ST may well be the definitive choice for enthusiastic drivers who also demand comfort around town and an array of subtle suspension enhancements ensures this is still the case.\nA powerful braking system is top of this list while Electronic Stability Programme (ESP) and Traction Control are now standard on all versions.\nThe Focus ST has always provided lots of choice and the range retains its simple ST, ST-2 and ST-3 trim grades and three or five-door hatchback bodystyles. It is priced from \u00a318,250 - \u00a320,850.\nEvery Focus ST boasts 18-inch five-spoke alloy wheels, sports styling, body-hugging Recaro sports seats, a unique sports steering wheel and upgraded instrumentation. New to this generation of ST are the \u2019Ford Power\u2019 starter button and Easyfuel capless refuelling system. Upgrading to ST-2 adds a Sony audio system, bi-xenon lights, LED rear lights and Quickclear heated windscreen while the ST-3 includes an in-dash six CD player plus full leather trim.\nIn common with other members of the 2008 Focus family, a range of high-tech options can be specified. Among the list is a Tyre Deflation Detection System, a new audio connectivity module for external devices like Bluetooth, voice control and navigation systems plus various infotainment options including an affordable sat nav system with SD card slot.\nCombining bold looks with a thrilling driving experience and numerous new features, Ford\u2019s new and improved Focus ST is the definitive hot hatch.\nI can say the exact same thing for the U.S."
