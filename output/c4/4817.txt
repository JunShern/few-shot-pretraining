    "text": "How do I access and enable more icons to be in the system tray?\nSo I'm messing around with Natty a little, and I noticed that all the apps that would normally use the system tray (or \"notification area\"?) aren't displaying there. Is that a bug, or is that the way it's going to be? I heard something about Ubuntu getting rid of that feature entirely. Is there a way to add it back? I mean, I didn't really like it, either, especially when there were apps that used it unnecessarily, but I can't use CryptKeeper at all now, or easycrypt, and I don't know whether Dropbox has synced without opening Nautilus.\nFrom Ubuntu 13.04 onwards you have to whitelist the applications if you want to allow access to the system tray.\nFirstly install dconf-tools from the software center ( or by clicking here) Then Press Alt+F2 and enter dconf-editor and run it.\nNow navigate to Desktop -> Unity -> Panel.\nHow do I set the panel whitelist back to the default?\nWhy aren't certain indicators showing in Unity?\ngsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Panel systray-whitelist \"['all']\"\nYou can upgrade Dropbox, as in the latest builds it has an indicator on Ubuntu. For other applications, if the developers do not add indicator support for them, you can simply white-list them as Alaukik says, and also notify the developer that they need to fix the application.\ngsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Panel systray-whitelist \"$(gsettings get com.canonical.Unity.Panel systray-whitelist | sed -e \"s/]$/, 'MYAPP']/\")\"\nInstead of changing it to 'all' I suggest adding the name of the desired application to the list. With this you avoid all kinds of problems with panel caused by the \"all\" value.\nFor example drweb indicator was missing, so I tried to add the command which executes dr web antivirus into the whitelist. The value was like ['JavaEmbeddedFrame', 'Wine', 'Update-notifier']. I changed it to ['JavaEmbeddedFrame', 'Wine', 'drweb-cc', 'Update-notifier'], then I logged out and logged in, and the indicator was on the panel.\nYou can edit its value to simply ['all'], you can restore it by clicking \"set to default\" button also.\nOr find out what icons you want to show, one by one and add them there.\nNot the answer you're looking for?
