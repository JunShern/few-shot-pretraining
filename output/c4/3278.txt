    "text": "Pok\u00e9mon Maize is an ambitious hack that overhauls Pok\u00e9mon Red Version and brings a whole new experience to the player. I've been working on Maize periodically for nearly four years now, so it has a lot of new features! The current release is Beta 2.2, which is essentially a revamp from Beta 1. There are tons of new features and gameplay that wasn't in Beta 1, and the Beta ends after 4 badges in Pyrite City. Keep reading below to see what new things Maize's Beta 2.2 has to offer.\nI decided to stick with a traditional Pok\u00e9-storyline. An organization known as Team Quarry is excavating vast amounts of materials from the ground in pursuit of building a mighty city to be the center of their empire (or something like that). While wielding your trusty broom, you set out on an adventure to become a Pok\u00e9mon master. Explore the region of Boldor while you attempt to thwart Team Quarry and tolerate your ridiculous childhood acquaintance.\nQ:\"Why didn't I receive the Town Map?\"\nA:Your rivals sister didn't give it to you. You can acquire it later on.\nQ:\"Why aren't my Running Shoes working?\"\nA:You need to press and hold the B button. You also need to acquire them from somebody in Agate City.\nQ:\"Why won't my Item Stone evolve my Slowpoke/Magmar/etc.?\"\nA:Those Pok\u00e9mon aren't in the game. Please see the list of new Pok\u00e9mon in further down in this thread.\nQ:\"Why isn't my Ring working?\"\nA:Items like the Shield Ring or Scouter only work when they are equipped in the top slot of the inventory. That means that only one special item can be equipped at a time. When in doubt, read the in-game item descriptions by selecting them in the items menu.\nQ:\"Why can't I find the Old Rod?\"\nA:It's in Agate City. Just look harder.\nQ:\"What is the main character holding in his hand?\"\nPlease note that not all of these items are obtainable in Beta 2.2. They are all fully functional in the game, though.\nThe current release of Maize is playable through 4 badges, the last of which is in Pyrite City. You can download the .ips patch from the link provided above, and then you'll need to apply the patch to the Pok\u00e9mon Red Version (english) ROM using a .ips patcher program, such as Lunar Magic.\n2.2 - Nuzlocke NPC gives a Clefairy instead of Paras. Various bug fixes. Added Shiny Pokemon, Shiny Ring, and Shiny Ball.\n2.1 - Added NPC who gives you HM-compatible Pokemon in Nuzlocke mode to prevent player from getting stuck. Fixed Basalt Cave ladder placement.\n2.0 - Complete overhaul of beta 1. Rebuilt entire project using the pokered disassembly. Added many new features.\n1.2.1 - Fixed evolution bug that calculated new stats incorrectly.\n1.2 - Finished Pyrite City. Added Honchkrow. Fixed growlithe evolution bug. Fixed starters' evolutions' growth rates.\n1.1.2 - Added Nostalgia-filled building and Pyrite City Outpost. Fixed some typos.\n1.1.1 - Bug fixes: pokedex now correctly displays caught/seen status; Growlithe no longer evolves by level if the battle is finished with Mareep; PP UP now works; fixed shared map data for Jade Village house and Pyrite City house.\n1.1.0 - Fixed future-gen attack animations. Finished Ma(i)ze house in Pyrite City. Squirtle is obtainable.\n1.0.0 - Initial Release. Playable through 4 badges.\nIf you think you or somebody else belongs on this list, please let me know! I've probably forgotten to mention some individuals.\nLook's amazing, keep it up the good work.\nI'm not a fan of 1st gen but looks cool.\nIf you used Swampert's mart editor, it uses the hex value for the wrong PP UP.\nThe real PP UP has an ID of $4F, and there is another item with the name \"PP UP\", but it can't be used and it has an ID of $32.\nSwampert's mart editor uses $32.\nAnyway, this looks really cool. I'll try this out tomorrow.\nEDIT: HAHA, I love your new Town Map script!\nWhaaat? 1st gen is the bomb! Thanks, though!\nI didn't use the mart editor, but I made the exact same mistake. It's good to know that this is a well-known thing. The reason I haven't fixed it yet is because I can't remember exactly where in the game you acquire the PP UP..... I'll find it on my next playthrough, though.\nI see you're just another typical RPG protagonist bursting into others' homes without permission!\nAh yeah, you posted it also here!\nI played also the Demo: it's enjoyable and it offers things which aren't expected in the most common \"minor\" hacks of Red\\Blue.\nYou put also a GivePokemon-like script, right?\nGenerally this game seems to be very cool and promises to be nice, keep the good work up mate!\nThanks for playing! Yeah, nobody seems to post on the thread at pokecommunity. Plus, this place seems more relevant for Gen 1 hacks, so I figured I would come over.\nWhat script is the \"GivePokemon-like script\" referring to? There are several scripts in the game that I'm especially proud of.\nCool hack! I always like when people insert custom music in their hacks.\nIt all looks neat from what I can see, but the player overworld sprite doesn't seem to fit into the rest of the game. I think it's the style of the hands, they usually have little ball hands.\nCan someone make it in .jar please?\nCool. So good that you have added the dark-steel/type. And some more pokemon and moves. Will you also add a second region in te upcoming betas?\nI'm sorry to report this, but I was still in the middle of the second dungeon when I caught a 26th Pok\u00e9mon (Abra) and then the Pok\u00e9dex got extremely glitched up.\nIn the Pok\u00e9dex, there is a Pok\u00e9ball still next to the correct Pok\u00e9mon that I have caught, but some of them are not marked as \"seen\" (as in, some have a Pok\u00e9ball next to a row of dashed lines).\nSo my \"owned\" data is still correct, but now it says I have seen 119 Pok\u00e9mon. I can see the new Pok\u00e9mon in the Pok\u00e9dex up to Murkrow, but after that, the seen Pok\u00e9mon are completely random (repeats of old Pok\u00e9mon, glitched Pok\u00e9mon). And I can scroll down to 203 before the game freezes.\nI don't know what caused this. It could have been from catching a 26th Pok\u00e9mon, it could be that Abra is broken, or it could have been coincidence. But the Pok\u00e9dex worked completely fine up until now.\nAlso, wasn't the limit of Pokemon set to 164?\nIf so, the limit of Pokedex entries probabilly has to be set to 164 instead of a higher number.\nI experimented some of those problems in the early developement stages of my hack too, but then I fixed them.\n80C, of course I would have considered those options.\nThe reason that this is unlikely is because it worked for so long with zero problems, even with catching 2nd gen Pok\u00e9mon, like Murkrow.\nMaybe that still occours because ShantyTown didn't changed Oak Rating System yet (it's not hard to figure out) or maybe because the Flags were repointed in a location that may interfere with other flags such as badges, pokemon in the party etc.\nHaha, I just realized something mid-sentence.\nHm, now that you mention it, the game told me I couldn't throw a Pok\u00e9ball because Box 1 was full, so I went to change boxes and then caught Abra.\nSo I actually had 6 Pok\u00e9mon in my party, 19 Pok\u00e9mon in Box 1, and then the glitching started when I had 1 Pok\u00e9mon in Box 2.\na game with a new storyline and music.i like it!\nA couple people have mentioned that the player's overworld sprite doesn't fit in. I kind of agree, but he's the main character from another game called Anodyne, so I don't want to change him at all... I guess I could try and change him to be more Pokemon-like, but I'm not exactly gifted in the artistic realm of things.\nI don't know much about this process, but here is a thread describing how to make one.\nNow, regarding this pokedex bug... I fixed the first (and simplest) issue, which was that you could scroll 8 pokedex slots past the last-seen pokemon. It was simply an off-by-one error in the pokedex viewing routine.\nDanny, thanks for providing me more info with how you noticed the caught/seen bug start. I initially thought there was a super easy fix to it, but that didn't turn out to be true.\nEDIT: I also just found the bug you described about the girl standing in a bookshelf. Apparently, the map of the school in Viridian City and the room where you acquire EEVEE in Celadon share the same map data... Guess I'll have to fix that, too.\nEDIT2: I just discovered that the bug is related to switching boxes.\nI released a new patch (beta 1.1.1) with lots of bug fixes. I believe I've fully resolved the pokedex caught/seen bug. You can read the list of changes in the changelog in the first post!\nJust a little question: Does the newpatched game work with the savefile of the old game?\nI'm not sure. I haven't tested it. If I had to guess, I would say \"yes, it works\".\nI've made some progress in Pyrite City the past few days. I completed a building which will let you experience maximum nostalgia.\nI also finished the Outpost in Pyrite City. You get your first Moon Stone there.\nWow, i like it nice work.\nWow, this just looks like another game!\nTMOTW have reason, looks like an game that happen in the space, or something like that.\nI'll accompany others - that screenshot does look interesting!\nI haven't tried out this hack yet, but I may do that eventually. Haven't been that into playing others' hacks although I like following updates on some specific hacks. There are so many I would like to try out (not talking about pokemon specifically, mainly hacks of other games) but then again, there are things I prefer to doing that."
