The British Board of Film Classifcation have today published the results of a lot of extensive research they have decied to undertake on games and the gaming industry. A fair few of the findings are fairly obvious, it\u2019s excellent that the words are coming from an offical regulatory body.\nIt\u2019s also good to see someone taking an imaprtial and indeed through study of the subject, especially with such happenings of the recent shootings in the US, of which certain people are already jumping on the blaming video games bandwaggon (anyone who follows the industry already knows whom I\u2019m talking about, the rest of you should do a search for Jack Thompson). The BBFC have also already been praised by Thompson previously, so I also feel the results of this survey, which pretty much debunk most of his arguments about the industry, are deliciously ironic for him.\nAnyway, I\u2019m going to read the full report, and hopefully comment more later, but for those of you in a hurry and want to know the main points, you can read about it on the BBFC website, and then download the report and have a look for yourself here."
