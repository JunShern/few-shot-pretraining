    "text": "Working toward a home improvement project together is a fun way to improve your home while improving family ties. A backyard is the perfect place to start, because you can be inventive and playful in the project design while including even smaller children.\nAt the end of the project, everyone will have a sense of personal pride in the project, and your yard will be the envy of the neighborhood. Here are some fun yard improvement projects that you can work on with the whole family.\nA fort or a play structure is an awesome project to build in your back yard. Kids can use it as a clubhouse, play make believe, and just generally have a fantastic time using their imaginations. Maybe your family prefers a tree house with a rope ladder, or a life size dollhouse with a play kitchen. Either way, make sure to involve the kids in the process by letting them choose design elements, pick paint colors, or help with age-appropriate construction tasks.\nInvolve the whole family in your garden project from planning to maintenance. Consider making a edible garden to encourage kids to eat their produce. Children may also enjoy a garden design with plenty of hidden paths or a sunflower ring fort or a tunnel of lilacs. Choosing plants that attract birds or butterflies can also be fun for kids. Make sure to involve kids in the planting and care of the garden as well for some educational and wholesome family fun.\nPut in a game space that you can enjoy as a family or while entertaining. You can build a giant chess game, checkers, or jenga. Build a bocce ball court or a horseshoes space. Decide as a family what you would use the most, and select age appropriate tasks that each member of the family can do on the project. For example, kids can paint or glue giant game pieces, rake a dirt court or be in charge of set up or clean up.\nThis is a big project, but it is an awesome project to involve the family in the process. Involve kids in planning the pool shape and size and depth if possible. Let kids choose a fun feature like a water slide, poolside climbing wall, or diving board. Rent a tractor or other such equipment to help get the job done. Although you should keep them at a safe distance from all the serious action, your children will love watching the machines work. Try to involve the kids in every step of the process that is safe for them to participate in and they will love their new pool all the more.\nThese are just a few ideas to get you started. The project you ultimately choose should be tailored to your family\u2019s wants and needs. Choose the right project, and your kids will have fun and learn important lessons about hard work while you make your backyard awesome.\nAuthor; Hannah Whittenly is a freelance writer and mother of two from Sacramento, CA.
