All you have to do to enter is go to http://www.facebook.com/target and become a fan of Target. Click on the \u201cSweepstakes\u201d tab and fill out the entry form. All entries must be received before midnight tomorrow and the winners will be drawn randomly this Friday, October 8th. You\u2019ll be competing against me, as I just finished casting my entry. But since there are a few bags to go around, I wish all of us luck!"
