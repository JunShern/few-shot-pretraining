    "text": "I love a pun. What is not to love?! Tweaking a phrase to create layered meaning is a damn fine use of anyone\u2019s time. A good pun tickles the back of your head, it inspires mental gymnastics as you crane to create several links in you brain at once.\nMy mum, ever the ideas woman, wanted to open a shop selling nautical second hand items. The shop title: Nauti secs. Don\u2019t deny that didn\u2019t raise a snicker at least!\nNewspapers love a pun. The erstwhile Channel 4 show \u2018The Big Breakfast\u2019 lauded the \u2018Pun of the Week\u2019 segment, a spot enormously enjoyed across the UK.\nThere is the famous kebab van in Bristol called \u2018Jason Donnervan\u2019. I challenge anyone not to applaud that work of genius.\nAnd finally: the Halal butchers named \u2018Halal, is it meat you\u2019re looking for?\u2019. The more tortured the better.\nIt is a truth puniversally acknowledged, that a human in possession of a sense of humour must be in want of a laugh.\nRicky Gervais has called them the \u201clowest form of wit\u201d.\nPresumably as sarcasm is the highest in his opinion, opening up the ground floor for a new loser. Even if you despise them, you cannot get away from them. They have more uses than just to make people gasp, snigger, groan. They have political validity. They can be crushingly painful.\nYes, dear reader, a pun can have weight. And this light-hearted look at the joy of punnery has indeed taken a turn. We all know those puns that deal with and flip the meaning of borderline offensive ideas, but the myriad ways in which meaning is imbued can be used to change the world, to revolt and reclaim power. Somewhat ironically, when looking at Orwell\u2019s dystopian fiction \u20181984\u2019, you can see puns at play.\nWithin the world of the novel, language is stripped of nuance, simultaneously creating an eroded selection of words that can mean many things, or only one thing when necessary. When expressing agreement, happiness or consent, \u201cGood\u201d, \u201cplus good\u201d and \u201cdouble plus good\u201d cuts out any room for exaggerated excitement.\nIt dulls the senses and keeps the protagonist and proles in line. Joyous expression is so individual \u2013 remove the nuance, you remove the individual. The destruction of creative language in the book curbs the minds of the people we meet, it is entirely chilling, and an incredibly viable tool.\nIn 2014, China actually banned the use of puns in the media, announcing that puns could incite \u201ccultural and linguistic chaos\u201d.\nFurther research into the use of puns in China found the use of \u2018May 35th\u2019, an alternative phrase which is used when discussing June 4th and the massacre at Tiananmen Square. May 35th is classic misdirection. It is seemingly a non-existent date, but add the first 4 days in June to the 31 days in May however, and bingo!\nCensorship of such phrases has been rife, with the internet in China becoming devoid of such alternatives as 8\u00d78 or 82, anything that related to the number 64, or the forbidden date 06/04. Even the collection of Chinese characters \u5360\u5360\u70b9 (which has no real combined meaning) has been banned because they look like tanks.\nThese are examples of what is known as a micropun. Their use allows discussions around topics the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) aim to stamp out of collective memory.\nPuns are a beacon, in this instance. They are a weapon of revolt, a creator of underground communities. On the surface, they are beautiful little mind games forming eddies of understanding rippling across your intellect. Pun and poetry are equally powerful means of rebellion, creation and persuasion.\nThe pundemental joy of wordplay is a successful tool of funny, intelligent people around the world. Upon learning the myriad ways in which the pun can inform, create rebellion, conjure laughter, and just generally connect the world, I have far more respect for it than I do for those who mock it.\nA tip of the cap to you sir!\nAll cards are by the punderful Hello Lucky!\nHow do I accept being average?"
