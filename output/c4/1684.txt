    "text": "At long last, the time has come. Today, The Tennis Recruiting Network and CrampsAWAY kick off our coverage of Signing Week 2018, and our slate of articles is ready to go.\nThis Wednesday, November 14th, is Signing Day - the first day that high school seniors can formally commit to Division I or II tennis programs. We have been counting down the days for the past month, but today we switch to our Signing Week coverage.\nFirst thing\u2019s first. Let\u2019s check in on the blue chip seniors.\nThe tables below show the blue chip athletes and their latest recruiting statuses. The Commitment column shows whether the recruit has made a verbal commitment or is undecided, while the Interests column indicates schools of interest for uncommitted players.\nAs was the case back in October, there are only a few blue chip boys remaining on the table - and there has been no real movement with the four remaining uncommitted boys. All of these players are keeping their candidate schools private.\nWe will continue to reach out to these boys over the coming weeks - and keep you up to date on their progress.\nThere has been some excitement on the girls side with two blue chip girls announcing their commitments over the past week. Angelica Blake of Boca Raton, Florida, got things started by announcing her commitment to Stanford, which TRN carried in this article.\nLater in the week, Gia Cohen, who has been focusing on ITF junior and professional events kept things moving when she announced her commitment to Georgia Tech. Cohen has gone 11-4 in ITF junior tournaments over the past year - including an appearance in the singles semifinal at the Eddie Herr International last November.\nAll in all, 16 of the 26 blue chip girls have now announced their commitments, and that number will go up by at least one on Signing Day. This Wednesday, three-time state champion Alana Wolfberg plans to announce her commitment. We will have coverage of that announcement right here at TRN.\nWe will keep an eye on all of these players as their stories continue to develop \u2026 but we already have a lot of content on the schedule.
