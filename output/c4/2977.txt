    "text": "An advanced interpretation of the 'Zoom-Zoom' design ethos, The Mazda Sassou is designed to mix the dynamism of the brand with a 'youthful lightness' and surprising hidden features never before seen on a Mazda concept.\nOnce these changes were incorporated, a 3-D scan of this side of the model was made using point-cloud data. Advanced computer software then created an exact mirror image of the scanned side for the other side of the Sassou. This computer image of the concept with all changes was then used to mill a full-sized version from a rough \u0093form block\u0094 covered in thick epoxy resin.\nThe full-sized model was then reviewed in one last approval session with a further developed exterior colour in Dynoc film, which could be removed so the team could fine tune the exterior design by hand. This exterior version of the concept was then frozen as the final version. It was then caste for final fibreglass production, from which body panels were made, painted and fitted to the chassis.\ndesign elements, as well as the concept\u0092s unique use of materials.\nA good example of this are Mazda Sassou\u0092s exterior lights, which are one of the concept\u0092s most interesting features, and one of the most difficult to realize. The team first built a full-sized functional front end based on design sketches and material selections, and tested it indoors, in showroom lighting conditions, and outdoors in sunlight. Changes were made until just the right type of exterior colour, surface treatment with translucency and the lighting technology behind this surface was found. Once finalised, they were milled using the same process as the body panels and then mounted to the front and rear of the final show car version.\nwith a distinct look and feel, and that included convenience features \u0096 like a USB stick activated hard disc drive system \u0096 that might someday be employed in a Mazda B-car.\nThe dashboard assembly went through the same design stages as the exterior, from concept to sketch to epoxy resin modelling. Extensive material testing was done by the entire design team to achieve the desired affect of hidden lighting, revealed when an interior system is activated.\nMazda Sassou\u0092s high-tech centre stack, instrument graphics door panels and seats were realized using the same design process as the exterior.\nSketches of the seating (above) are realised in wood and clay (left)."
