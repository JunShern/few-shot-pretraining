Our training mechanism is designed to arm teachers with practical and effective techniques, which are easy to incorporate with children.\nAn interactive Q&A session after every workshop/seminar ensures in-depth understanding of concepts and better interaction with trainers.\nThrough all training interventions, we enable our teachers to bring Illume to life. We get our academic managers to observe teachers conducting Illume-in-action and provide diagnostic feedback."
