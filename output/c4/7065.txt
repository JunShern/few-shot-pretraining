    "text": "An accident involving a large truck, such as a tractor-trailer or semi truck, can be devastating for all drivers or any passengers involved. While some truck accidents are caused by driver error or defective equipment, improper cargo loading can be at fault.\nWhen a truck accident is caused by improper cargo loading, someone needs to be held liable. A legal professional is a valuable asset in recovering compensation following a truck accident.\nWhen cargo isn\u2019t loaded according to regulations, the risk of an accident increases. Improperly loaded or overloaded cargo can increase the number of risks. Loading too much cargo can add excessive weight to a truck, which may put it at risk for a tire blowout or tipping over in a turn.\nBut the greatest risk of improperly loaded cargo is that it may shift during transport. A cargo shift can be extremely dangerous for an already large and heavy truck, and may lead to multiple types of truck accidents.\nIf any of the above occurs, other drivers are a high risk of being involved in the accident.\nIf an accident caused by improperly loaded cargo occurs, injuries can be severe. If an improperly loaded trucks hits another vehicle, experiences a rollover, or drops cargo from the truck, other drivers risk sustaining injuries such as these.\nSadly, accidents involving large trucks often cause injuries that result in permanent disability or long-term impairment and complication. Spinal cord injuries, for one, can result in permanent paralysis.\nIf you\u2019ve been in a truck accident, seeking compensation for your injuries can be complicated. If the accident was caused by improperly loaded or overloaded cargo, a variety of people or entities could be held responsible for your injuries.\nThe Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration has very explicit cargo securement and loading rules. if these rules were violated, then one of the above responsible parties will most likely be held liable.\nIf any of the above parties are found liable, then you can recover damages for the harm that you\u2019ve suffered. Damages may be payable for your medical expenses and lost wages, as well as personal emotional distress or pain and suffering.\nIf you want to pursue a personal injury suit for damages, you have two years from the date of injury to do so, according to Chapter 55 \u2013 Title 42 of Pennsylvania Code. An attorney can help you get started.\nBecause of the statute of limitations, which limits the time you have to recover compensation, it\u2019s important that you contact a personal injury attorney as soon as possible.
