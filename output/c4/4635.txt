    "text": "REPORTER (Jeff Mason from Reuters): For President Putin if I could follow up as well. Why should Americans and why should President Trump believe your statement that Russia did not intervene in the 2016 election given the evidence that US Intelligence agencies have provided? Will you consider extraditing the 12 Russian officials that were indicted last week by a US Grand jury.\nTRUMP: Well I\u2019m going to let the president [meaning Putin] answer the second part of that question.\nAs you know, the concept of that came up perhaps a little before, but it came out as a reason why the Democrats lost an election, which frankly, they should have been able to win, because the electoral college is much more advantageous for Democrats, as you know, than it is to Republicans. [That allegation from Trump is unsupported, and could well be false.] We won the electoral college by a lot. 306 to 223, I believe. [It was actually 304 to 227.] That was a well-fought battle. We did a great job.\nFrankly, I\u2019m going to let the president speak to the second part of your question. But, just to say it one time again and I say it all the time, there was no collusion. I didn\u2019t know the president. There was nobody to collude with. There was no collusion with the campaign. Every time you hear all of these 12 and 14 \u2014 it\u2019s stuff that has nothing to do \u2014 and frankly, they admit, these are not people involved in the campaign. But to the average reader out there, they are saying, well maybe that does. It doesn\u2019t. Even the people involved, some perhaps told mis-stories. In one case the FBI said there was no lie. There was no lie. Somebody else said there was. We ran a brilliant campaign. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m president. Thank you.\nPUTIN: As to who is to be believed, who is not to be believed: you can trust no one. Where did you get this idea that President Trump trusts me or I trust him? He defends the interests of the United States of America and I do defend the interests of the Russian Federation. We do have interests that are common. We are looking for points of contact.\nThere are issues where our postures diverge and we are looking for ways to reconcile our differences, how to make our effort more meaningful. We should not proceed from the immediate political interests that guide certain political powers in our countries. We should be guided by facts. Could you name a single fact that would definitively prove the collusion? This is utter nonsense \u2014 just like the president recently mentioned. Yes, the public at large in the United States had a certain perceived opinion of the candidates during the campaign. But there\u2019s nothing particularly extraordinary about it. That\u2019s the normal thing.\nPresident Trump, when he was a candidate, he mentioned the need to restore the Russia/US relationship, and it\u2019s clear that certain parts of American society felt sympathetic about it and different people could express their sympathy in different ways. Isn\u2019t that natural? Isn\u2019t it natural to be sympathetic towards a person who is willing to restore the relationship with our country, who wants to work with us?\nWe heard the accusations about it. As far as I know, this company hired American lawyers and the accusations doesn\u2019t have a fighting chance in the American courts. There\u2019s no evidence when it comes to the actual facts. So we have to be guided by facts, not by rumors.\nNow, let\u2019s get back to the issue of this 12 alleged intelligence officers of Russia. I don\u2019t know the full extent of the situation. But President Trump mentioned this issue. I will look into it.\nFor instance, the last year, there was one extradition case upon the request sent by the United States. This treaty has specific legal procedures we can offer. The appropriate commission headed by Special Attorney Mueller, he can use this treaty as a solid foundation and send a formal, official request to us so that we could interrogate, hold questioning of these individuals who he believes are privy to some crimes. Our enforcement are perfectly able to do this questioning and send the appropriate materials to the United States. Moreover, we can meet you halfway. We can make another step. We can actually permit representatives of the United States, including the members of this very commission headed by Mr. Mueller, we can let them into the country. They can be present at questioning.\nFor instance, we can bring up Mr. Browder in this particular case. Business associates of Mr. Browder have earned over $1.5 billion in Russia. They never paid any taxes. Neither in Russia nor in the United States. Yet, the money escapes the country. They were transferred to the United States. They sent huge amount of money, $400 million as a contribution to the campaign of Hillary Clinton. [He presents no evidence to back up that $400 million claim.] Well, that\u2019s their personal case. It might have been legal, the contribution itself. But the way the money was earned was illegal. We have solid reason to believe that some intelligence officers guided these transactions. [This allegation, too, is merely an unsupported assertion here.] So we have an interest of questioning them. That could be a first step. We can also extend it. There are many options. They all can be found in an appropriate legal framework.\nREPORTER (Jeff Mason from Reuters): Did you direct any of your officials to help him [Trump] do that [find those \u2018options\u2019]?\nPUTIN: Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because he talked about bringing the US/Russia relationship back to normal.\nThe evidence regarding that entire matter, of Bill Browder and the Magnitsky Act, can be seen in the links and the other evidences that are presented in two articles that I published on that very subject, earlier this year. One, titled \u201cPrivate Investigations Find America\u2019s Magnitsky Act to Be Based on Frauds\u201d, summarizes the independently done private investigations into the evidence that is publicly available online regarding Bill Browder and the Magnitsky Act. The Magnitsky Act was the basis for the first set of economic sanctions against Russia, and were instituted in 2012; so, this concerns the start of the restoration of the Cold War (without the communism etc. that were allegedly the basis of Cold War I). The other article, \u201cRussiagate-Trump Gets Solved by Giant of American Investigative Journalism\u201d, provides further details in the evidence, and connects both the Magnitsky Act and Bill Browder to the reason why, on 9 June 2016, the Russian lawyer Nataliya Veselnitskaya, met privately at Trump Tower, with Donald Trump Jr., Paul Manafort, and Jared Kushner \u2014 the reason was specifically in order to inform them about the documentation on this case, so that Trump, if elected, would be aware of the contents of those documents. She had used the promise of dirt on Hillary so as to enable Trump, who effectively became the Republican nominee on 26 May 2016, to learn about the actual documents in this crucial case.\nThe Russian government has been legally pursuing Mr. Browder, for years, on charges that he evaded paying $232 million taxes that were due to the Russian government. These private investigations into this matter \u2014 regarding whether or not the Magnitsky Act was based on fraudulent grounds \u2014 have all found that Mr. Browder has clearly falsified and misrepresented the actual documents, which are linked to in those two articles I wrote. These might be the very same documents that she was presenting on June 9th.\nSo: this is a matter of importance not only to the validity (or not) of the Magnitsky Act economic sanctions against Russia, but to the Russiagate accusations regarding U.S. President Donald Trump. In my two articles, the general public can click right through to the evidence on the Magnitsky case."
