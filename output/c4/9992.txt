I wanted to make sure that blog readers had this important overview of the getting unstuck process, before we get into more specific tips and ideas. And here on the blog, we can discuss what you\u2019re learning and how you\u2019re putting it to work to get \u2013 and stay \u2013 unstuck and live in flow.\nTo get your monthly newsletter with more tips, ideas and ways to feel inspired and energized, request your Achieve Your Ideal Results kit using the sign-up area to the right.\nWhen you\u2019re feeling stuck or stressed, it\u2019s easy to feel that no one understands exactly what you\u2019re going through. And you\u2019re right. Everyone\u2019s situation is indeed unique.\nBut there are a series of steps that apply across the board. Here\u2019s an overview of the process and some simple questions to get you started living more in flow.\nBeing stuck in your life is a lot like being stuck in your car in a snow bank. You can keep pressing the accelerator, making the car work harder and harder, but it\u2019s not going anywhere.\nThrow a little bit of sand under the wheels though, and all of a sudden you start to move.\nYou\u2019re not a car, but when you\u2019re stuck, the same principle applies.\nFind one or two practical, manageable actions, and all of a sudden you start to move.\nOverwhelm and frustration \u2013 between the two of them, it\u2019s hard to think clearly or find new perspectives on what\u2019s happening.\nFor anyone who grew up driving on wintry roads, you know what to do when you get stuck. But after a lifetime in Southern California, my first experience getting stuck on a snowy incline was an eye-opener. I had no idea how to get the car moving so I just kept doing the same thing over and over, working myself up into quite a sweat.\nIt wasn\u2019t until I finally got out of the car and took a deep breath that I realized I needed something for traction. (All of you who know how to drive in snow can stop laughing now. ;-)) Miraculously I had a bag of kitty litter in my trunk that I\u2019d not yet carried into my house.\nCreating some breathing room opens space for new ideas. It gives you a chance to listen to your gut, your heart, and your intuition. A few minutes sitting in your chair taking deep breaths, going for a short walk, or bopping around the room to dance party music may be all it takes.\nOnce you have traction and room to breathe, it\u2019s much easier to gain clarity. You\u2019re better able to be honest with yourself about what\u2019s really most important and what trade-offs you\u2019re willing to make. You\u2019ll have more emotional and mental energy to challenge your assumptions and open up to new possibilities.\nAs you sort through what\u2019s right for you, you\u2019re able to integrate the three dimensions of your life: who you are, what you do, and how you do it. And that is your recipe for living with a sense of flow.\nWhere are you stuck right now? Be really specific and don\u2019t judge.\nWhat is one tiny step you can take to gain some traction? It could be closing your email program 30 minutes a day, working on your resume for 15 minutes every morning, or starting your day by writing down one small thing to do that day to move you one step closer to your goal.\nWrite down your step daily and acknowledge your progress every day. And if you backslide, be kind to yourself and start again.\nThe night I was stuck on the snowy road, I was thrilled to realize I didn\u2019t have to wait for a warmer weather to get moving again. You too don\u2019t have to wait to get going!!\nPlease use the comment box below to share your thoughts on this article and your experience creating some traction on whatever has you stuck or stressed."
