Some have stuck to the common, ordinary house designs while others have creative ones that are rather strangely out of the box.\nIf you\u2019re needing some inspiration to design your new home, here are some for you!\nOnce a fan of the classic cartoon The Flintstones? Maybe you\u2019d eye this Flintstones-inspired house. This single-story abode in Malibu is priced at $3.5 million.\nThis portable wooden structure designed by Van Bo Le-Mentzel is the world\u2019s smallest house at only a square meter. It\u2019s been moving around Germany since its creation.\nBham Design Studio has transformed this old 100-feet high water tower turned Nazi hideout during the war into a lovely livable space.\nThis fairly large rock house in Portugal is furnished with a door, a chimney, and a window. Tourists have been flocking to its location for a closer look of this weird thing.\nOur homes should be private, but if you\u2019d like to show off to your neighbors what\u2019s happening inside your house, this completely transparent house designed by Sou Fujomoto Architects is the one for you! It\u2019s the modern version of tree houses, and it offers you much daylight.\nOn one side of this three-story house is a regular staircase while on the other lies a slide, which takes you all the way down to the first floor. Great for families with kids and for kids at heart!\nZecc Architecten gave new purpose to two abandoned churches in Utrecht, the Netherlands, and converted them into modern family residences.\nBetween two buildings is inserted the Keret House, which measures only 92 to 152 centimeters wide! If you\u2019re single and do not mind the tiny space, this house will suit you perfectly!\nInspired by the work of Gaudi and Frank Lloyd Wright, this house is owned by a family with two kids. It is a seashell-shaped house designed and built for them by Arquitectura Organica.\nSkaters can skate all day in this skateboard house as its surfaces, both indoors and outdoors, are designed for skateboarding."
