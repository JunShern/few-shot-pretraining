    "text": "SYNOPSIS: A practical and extensive collection of ideas, frameworks, tools and tips to supercharge your learning, ostensibly for programmers but relevant to anyone who plans on hacking their learning at school, home and work \u2013 by programmer and life-long learner, Andy Hunt of Pragmatic Programmers.\nNOTE: Not all books are created equal. And Pragmatic Thinking and Learning is easily one of the most comprehensive and practical on learning I\u2019ve yet read.\nAnd you\u2019ll find not only these but many (many) more ideas, frameworks and techniques inside.\nThere\u2019s so much in here it would be very hard to know where to practically (let alone pragmatically) begin.\nThat said, there is huge value here (far more than I could even begin to get to in 3 hours) and I definitely plan to come back for a couple of weeks of thorough crunching.\nLike The 7 Habits, Getting Things Done or How to Win Friends \u2013 Pragmatic Thinking and Learning is the kind of book best kept on your shelf and revisited at least once every year for as long as it takes to internalise its thoughts.\nFor now, I\u2019ve pulled out the structure, \u201crecipes\u201d, end-of-section actions and a few frameworks to give you an overview (and remind me) of the ground the book covers.\nIf you\u2019re looking for a solid, practical primer on Learning How to Learn \u2013 even if you never have or never plan to learn programming \u2013 this book is a great place to start.\nBeyond Expertise \u2013 Unraveling change, its many obstacles, and how to get started tomorrow.\nRecipe 1: Treat people according to their expertise.\nRecipe 2: Use rules for novices, intuition for experts.\nRecipe 3: Know what you don\u2019t know.\nRecipe 4: Learn by watching and imitating.\nRecipe 5: Keep practising in order to remain expert.\nRecipe 6: Avoid formal method if you need creativity, intuition or inventiveness.\nRecipe 7: Learn the skill of learning.\nWhere do you see yourself in the Dreyfus method for your core skills?\nAnd for your other skills? Be aware of metacognitive blindness.\nWhat would it take to advance each skill to the next level?\nReflect on problems you\u2019ve experienced in teams \u2013 how could the Dreyfus model help?\nWhere are your teammates on their own journey?\nExperts \u2013 targeted, intuitive actors.\nInnovate \u2013 offer an original thought.\nRecipe 8: Capture all ideas to get more of them.\nRecipe 9: Learn by synthesis as well as by analysis.\nRecipe 10: Strive for good design; it really works better.\nRecipe 11: Rewire your brain with belief and constant practice.\nList your favourite and least favourite apps. How important are aesthetics?\nAre your L-mode (analytical) and R-mode (creative) in balance? If not, how can you balance them?\nKeep doodle pads to hand wherever you spend time and use them.\nKeep a note pad or note taking device with you 24 x 7 and use it.\nN.B., for more on L-mode and R-mode (mentioned several times below), see this Wiki article on lateralisation of brain function.\nRecipe 12: Add sensory experience to engage more of your brain.\nRecipe 13: Lead with R-mode (creative); follow will L-mode (analytical).\nRecipe 14: Use metaphor as the meeting place between L-mode and R-mode.\nRecipe 15: Cultivate humour to build stronger metaphors.\nRecipe 16: Step away from the keyboard to solve hard problems.\nRecipe 17: Change your viewpoint to solve the problem.\nUse a thesaurus or WordNet to help make new metaphors.\nDo morning pages for at least two weeks.\nLook for connections and analogies between unrelated things.\nInvolve more senses when facing a tricky problem.\nInvert problems for a fresh perspective.\nRecipe 19: Be comfortable with uncertainty.\nRecipe 20: Trust ink over memory; every mental read is a write.\nRecipe 21: Hedge your bets with diversity (of people).\nRecipe 22: Allow for different bugs in different people.\nRecipe 23: Act like you\u2019ve evolved: breathe, don\u2019t hiss.\nRecipe 24: Trust intuition but verify.\nList the cognitive biases (see below) that you recognise in yourself.\nHow many very unlikely events have you noticed in your life? How unlikely were they with hindsight?\nStart and maintain a log of notes from meetings.\nDetermine which generation you were born into and reflect on its implications.\nDetermine the generation your coworkers belong to.

How does this change when you \u201cthink about it\u201d?\nAct on impulse, but not immediately.

Doing so may be as effective as antidepressants.\nWhen in conflict, broaden your awareness and consider the full context to help find a solution.\nInterrogate your own position. How do you know?
