    "text": "However, there\u2019s one type of revenue source that we haven\u2019t discussed yet, and it may be a great strategy to fill many of your slow daytime hours: Hosting athletic-themed preschool programs.\nSteady, recurring revenue is important for any sports academy, but it\u2019s essential for those who operate their own spaces. Whether these businesses have constructed their own buildings, purchased them, or are leasing them exclusively, owners are on the hook for big overhead costs every single month. They\u2019re also trying to ride out seasonal changes in demand for practice space and programming. Both of these factors lead to the kind of cash flow struggles that can shut sports facilities down. (Related: Managing Cash Flow at Your Sports Academy).\nParents looking for child care usually need services for several hours each day (much more than the hour or two of classes you\u2019d typically be trying to fill) and for several months at a time. A preschool or child care program could book up a majority of your turf, floor or studio space during your slow hours.\nHave some reservations about pivoting your brand and business model to host what seems like a very different service for half of the day? Don\u2019t worry. Hosting preschool programs doesn\u2019t have to be a huge commitment, and it can be tied in with the rest of your brand and mission.\nAs fitness and athletics professionals, you know all about the enormous value of physical movement for kids and adults alike. Physical and sensory experiences are also extremely important for children under age 6.\nAs any parent knows, there are plenty of times in small children\u2019s development where movement is paramount. At various points, kids are laser-focused on learning how to roll, crawl, walk, balance, and jump. Plenty of families recognize how important this aspect of development is, and they\u2019re looking for care options that take it seriously.\nPlus, many parents of older preschoolers would love the chance to expose their kids to things like tumbling, martial arts, dance, and beginner sports. If these experiences are rolled into their daily care, that\u2019s a big perk \u2014 especially when the instruction is coming from credentialed staff.\nIf you brand your preschool as a good fit for high-energy kids who love to move, you may reach a demographic that isn\u2019t getting their needs met elsewhere. Current member families who already trust your facility and staff will be especially happy to bring their smaller children in for a few hours during the day.\nIt\u2019s not necessary to host preschool for the entirety of traditional school hours, or even every day. Many families start their children out in preschool just a few days a week for as little as 2.5 hours.\nAnd thanks to the gig economy and growing work-from-home job opportunities, more parents need part-time care on a more flexible basis. That opens up an even easier option for you: Invite parents to stay on site and get work done while their children play. Laws regulating child care can be extensive and vary by state, but many have few regulations for child care options where the parents stays on site. That\u2019s why places like churches and fitness facilities often offer more casual and flexible child care options.\nIf you have a comfortable lobby area with a few tables, you may be able to basically convert your sports academy into a coworking space with childcare for several hours in the morning.\nDespite the potential for this idea to be a big help to your business, it\u2019s certainly not to be taken lightly, and it won\u2019t be a good fit for every sports academy.\nYour company may also be particularly suited to adapt to programming for small children if it\u2019s already family-friendly. In particular, tumbling facilities (or fitness spaces that offer a tumbling or dance program for little ones) have typically already invested in mats, tunnels, and tools for large-motor physical play.\nBut if your gym can\u2019t be childproofed, for example, hosting preschool won\u2019t work. If you have an especially intense brand geared toward older athletes, you\u2019ll have to be careful not to corrupt that brand. And if you want to pursue a type of child care where children are dropped off for longer periods of time, you\u2019ll certainly be subject to a host of regulations and laws that you may not be prepared to take on.\nRegardless of your unique situation, consult with your lawyer and make sure that you\u2019re insured for this type of activity.\nYou\u2019ll may also need to make a few new hires if you don\u2019t have anyone qualified on your staff, which is always a big investment of your time and energy. However, if you have staffers who love kids and are familiar with the needs of younger ones, it can be a great way to give them lots of more reliable hours. Your staffers should already be trained in first aid and CPR, which is another marketing point for parents looking for child care.\nWhat do you think? Would you consider preschool programming in your sports facility? Leave a comment and let me know."
