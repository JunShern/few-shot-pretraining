Not sure how 2011 can be topped though\u2026it\u2019s going to be tough but I\u2019m eager to see all it has to offer! My plans for taking December off from shooting & design work went great and I know for sure, I will do that again I had some precious newborns & a workshop, but it was nice to not travel for sessions for a whole month straight! However, now that January is upon us, I am already booked for a few family sessions in addition to 6 newborns! I figured it was the perfect time to give my clients and other photographers some styling inspiration! Up until now, San Diego has seen a fairly warm winter (which I HATE), so these outfit combinations are perfect for Southern California or for early Spring looks\u2026.\nThis is totally awesome\u2026thanks so much for sharing!!!!\nThanks so much for sharing these!
