After looking up the artist and reading about some of the reactions to the art, it prompted me to do more research. Fell down one of those rabbit holes on the web, but found a bunch of new sites I'll be re-visiting. It's kind of sad how little real California history got taught in the schools when I was a kid, maybe it's better now....?\nThe artist who created the bike/pedestrian bridge sculptures known as \"The Berkeley Big People\"\nbe in Part Three of this post.\nBerkeley side of Freeway 80, a nice freshwater lake or lagoon...?\nKayak and canoe rentals, have to see if I can launch my own craft here.\nThese were all shot from the walkway up to the Bike/pedestrian way.\nDidn't know it at the time, but this bit of graffiti has a tie-in with some on the Emeryville side.\nLooking South towards Emeryville/Oakland. Lake to the left, Ocean Bay to right.\nWalking up to the Sculpture on the Emeryville side, \"The Recreationists...?\"\nOn the walkway Emeryville side, that ties in with graffiti on the Berkeley side.\nThinking this is a good point to end \"Part 2\", will be back with what I found on the Emeryville side.\nWas expecting a park of some sort...?\nIf you happen to look at this post, let me know if you have any problems with the links, Thanks.\nThose are really interesting sculptures, not only very artistic, but also tell a story. Links work fine.\nThanks Norman, they seemed to work o.k. when I tested them from here. A few times at other sites I've had problems with links. Must be getting the hang of it."
