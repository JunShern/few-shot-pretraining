    "text": "Arnaldur Indirdason\u2019s Icelandic thriller series, featuring Inspector Erlendur, continues with this look into his early days as a detective in Into Oblivion, an aspect first explored in last year\u2019s acclaimed Reykjavik Nights. The CWA Gold Dagger Award winner is the only author to win the Glass Key Award for Best Nordic Crime Novel two years in a row, and with good reason.\nThe book opens a few years after Erlandur decides he wants to be a detective. It\u2019s 1979 and the year springs to life, the mood set by the music, clothing and social mores of the era. The detective is working with Marion Briem, an older, more experienced detective, when the body of man is found in a blue lagoon known for its healing waters.\nExamination reveals that the man has fallen from a great height and died before his body was moved to the lagoon. Could he have fallen from a plane? The only immense height in the area is an aircraft hanger on the grounds of the controversial US military base nearby.\nWhen it becomes apparent the base is involved, Erlandur and Briem find themselves tiptoeing around the base to investigate after the US powers that be have stalled their investigation and denied them access to the hanger. It will take an unlikely accomplice to help them get to the bottom of the man\u2019s death, thwarted by a rogue CIA agent.\nAs the action unfolds, Erlandur also takes it upon himself to run a parallel cold case investigation. A young teen went missing on her way to school, her body never found, and as both cases heat up, the young detective finds himself in his element, conducting interviews and following slender leads to find resolution.\nAnother hit that gives insight into what made Erlandur the detective he becomes.\nEngland\u2019s rural Derbyshire is the setting for Sarah Ward\u2019s debut mystery, In Bitter Chill, introducing introspective DI Francis Sadler, DC Connie Childs and their team. It promises to be the best of police procedurals, where the mystery is strong and setting as stark as the killings being investigated.\nThirty years ago two young children were kidnapped on their way to school. Rachel Jones was found wandering hours later, but her companion, Sophie Jenkins, never surfaced and no trace of her body was ever found.\nOn the 30th anniversary of what is surely Sophie\u2019s death, her mother commits suicide, which reopens the cold case in hopes the original team overlooked something that might lead to resolution of the case.\nRachel has become a genealogist and a local history expert who lives quietly and would continue to do so but this reopening of the case on the heels of Mrs. Jenkins suicide disrupts the peace Rachel has created, bringing reporters at her door. Worst of all are her efforts to remember details of that horrific day, when the girls were coaxed by a woman into a car with disastrous results.\nThen a former teacher of Rachel\u2019s is found strangled in the same woods where the girls went missing, and suddenly no one in the area feels safe, least of all, Rachel Jones. As Sadler and Connie investigate the new and old cases, they uncover secrets long kept buried as the threat rises.\nWard does a nice job of letting the setting become another character, and gives us enough of the inner lives of Sadler and Connie, as well as Connie\u2019s closest competition in the team, the almost-married Palmer, to make readers look for the next installment of this team. Destined to be a series readers will seek out.\nSarah Ward: I was living and Greece at the time I wrote the book and having a bout of homesickness. It was incredibly hot, and I kept myself cool by thinking of the Derbyshire winter. It seemed natural to use that area, but Stephen Booth has stolen a lot of the popular places! So I made up a fictional town surrounded by the real ones and that\u2019s worked well. I think being at some remove helped me write it, too, although having lived there I obviously know the area well. In the winter the tourists have gone and it\u2019s deserted and feels isolated but very beautiful.\nAuntie M: That certainly comes through, the majesty of the area as well as its bleak isolation. What about the sequel, which I hear is written and will be out next year? What it easier or tougher to write?\nSW: I was back in Derbyshire by then and it seemed a bit harder to remove myself from the area as I wrote. It\u2019s such a lovely area, with the Peak District National Park owned by private landowners. I\u2019m quite proud of the fact that it was the first national park, this jewel of nature surrounded by South Manchester, Sheffield and Nottingham, great industrial areas.\nAM: After you chose the setting, what prompted this particular storyline?\nSW: I had a very similar incident happen to me when I was twelve and walking to school. A woman stopped and asked me to post a letter for her, which I did, and then wanted to drive me the rest of the way to school. I didn\u2019t get in her car, but she was persistent until she finally drove off. I never told my parents about it, either. But years later I wondered what would have happened if I HAD gotten into that car . . . so I made the story revolve around two younger girls who had gotten into the car with the woman.\nAM: Was there a kind of release in writing it down, exploring that episode?\nSW: To a degree, but the most surprising thing about exposing secrets, which the book revolves around, is that people come up to me all the time at signings and tell me their secrets, completely without prompting. It\u2019s usually family secrets of some kind, so I suppose the book has struck a chord with them.\nAM: What about the relationships of Sadler, Connie and Palmer?\nSW: I have a story arc planned, oh yes, but I\u2019m not giving away secrets except to say there\u2019s a surprise there\u2013you\u2019ll just have to read the next one to see what\u2019s happening!\nLynda LaPlante\u2019s newest DCI Anna Travis novel, at close to 500 pages, could encompass two stories and then some. The London detective finds herself heavily embroiled in a case of suicide which is reopened after a criminal awaiting trial claims he has information that proves the man was murdered. With too many suspects to count, and far too many toes to step on, Travis is treading lightly when she\u2019s handed a partner from the US, FBI profiler Jessie Dewar, part of the same exchange program that finds Travis seconded to an FBI course in the US.\nDewar\u2019s brash approach soon ruffles feathers in everyone from suspects being interviewed to members of Travis\u2019 team. It\u2019s an uneasy alliance, even as Travis realizes Dewar has solid information to contribute.\nAuntie M has a love-hate relationship with these books. La Plante\u2019s dialogue with its lack of contractions often sounds stilted and formal. Yet there\u2019s no question the author of the Prime Witness series has a knack for complex plots and that is certainly on view here. You\u2019ll notice Auntie M keeps reading the series, because despite the reading flaws, the stories are compelling and the cases far from simple.\nAlways on the side is Travis\u2019 boss, Langton, with whom she has her own complicated history. And there will be the potential for Travis to finally have some kind of private life after the death of her fianc\u00e9 two years ago. A storyline in the US is conveniently cleared after Travis gets on the case, and it remains to be seen if she will return to the US in future entries in the series.\nAuntie M is a huge fan of M R Hall\u2019s series featuring Coroner Jenny Cooper and her complicated life. He gets inside a woman\u2019s head well and writes in a believable voice. The cases are complex and yet have the ring of truth, and along the way, readers learn what constitutes the real job of a coroner.\nIn this outing, it\u2019s the cold period between Christmas and New Year\u2019s when Jenny is called to an horrific scene: a house has burned to the ground and it\u2019s later discovered that three members of the family were inside; two daughters and stepfather Ed Morgan. With evidence of shotgun injuries to the three bodies, it is felt that Ed killed the girls and turned the gun on himself after starting the fire. But what has happened to his young son with wife Kelly, who was off premises at work that evening?\nIt\u2019s a complicated case, made all the more so by some witnesses withholding information and others not realizing how important their information may be. And how does it tie in to the disappearance ten years ago of another young girl from the same village? There will come a time when Jenny isn\u2019t certain who she can trust and that includes members of the police force who are supposed to be helping her investigation.\nAdd in the twists of Jenny\u2019s personal life, and the return of her assistant after an accident from she sustained in the last book, helping to save Jenny\u2019s life and that of her son, and it all adds up to a complex and compelling read.\nAuntie M is surprised more readers haven\u2019t discovered this always-satisfying series. Give it a try if you haven\u2019t yet found the delightful and compelling novels in this series."
