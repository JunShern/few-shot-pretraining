Black Rock Solar started as a project at Burning Man to power part of Black Rock City. We\u2019re named after the Black Rock Desert in which the Burning Man event takes place, a reflection of our deep roots in the Burning Man community. The staff and board of Black Rock Solar (BRS) will be on site at the Culture Labs daily to discuss what it is that BRS does, and how to get 'plugged in' to alternative energy yourself. Consult the experts, have a glass of tea, hang out in the shade. Discover what the other Outreach groups (BRAF, Regionals, BWB) are up to. We'll have a map of Black Rock City available so you can add your camp with your alternative energy installation to it, and see what the other denizens of our fair city are up to this year."
