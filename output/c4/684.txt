On this occasion the wedding was taking place at the Spa Hotel in Saltburn so it provided us with the perfect opportunity to explore the sea front.\nPlease have a look at more of my photographs here.\nAs I've mentioned before, sometimes I don't have long to get the photos I need on the day. It is often a case of a small window of time to get as many shots as you can.\nOn this occasion we found ourselves on Saltburn Pier on a cold November day.\nI work at the Spa Hotel in Saltburn a couple of times a year but up until now I have not had a couple that have requested to go to the sea front & pier for photographs.\nSo I was pleased on this occasion when the bride & groom asked me to go down there for photographs.\nAre you getting married in Saltburn? or somewhere else? Please contact us today to discuss your wedding photography in more detail.\nHere is a slideshow of a wedding I photographed at Rushpool Hall over the summer.\nThere are over 60 photographs in the slideshow, more than I usually share in a blog post, I thought it would be good to show a more detailed look at a wedding today.\nAre you getting married at Rushpool Hall? please contact me today to discuss your wedding photography."
