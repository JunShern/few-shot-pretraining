    "text": "In a multi-lingual setting (either where a country has more than one official language, or when an organisation employs speakers of different languages), it would be useful to present the interview for a template in the language of the user. Why this is an issue is that it appears obvious that the captions, help, etc. in a template will be encoded in the language of the template. But in a multi-lingual setting it might very often be the case that a user of one language is required to run templates whose merged document will be in another language. It would be really useful for XpressDox to be able to present an interview in French if the user is a French speaker, and in English for English users, where the document itself is in English. For the same template. And vice versa. XpressDox can indeed do that, as long as the template author marks up the template accordingly.\nInclude the following at the end of the template, replacing the duplicate commands with these, or by inspection merge them \u2013 play around and see what happens.\nSave the Layout.xdtpl template and then run the Will template.\nUsing the Settings>Language sub-menu on the XpressDox ribbon, change the language between French and English and see what happens.\nSome of the controls on the interview will not behave in the way expected. In particular the <<ChooseFromRDBList(FailingClause,\u2026..)>>. This is because the command appears in the Will template as well as the Layout template. Play around with these commands until you get what you want.\nNone of the Help messages have been translated above, but by this time you should be in a position to try doing that."
