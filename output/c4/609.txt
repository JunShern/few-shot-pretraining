For conditions on other climbs, return to Planning a Climb.\nCondition reports come from climbing and wilderness rangers, the voluntary climbing register, and other climbers. To make a climbing report, please email the Wilderness Information Center in Marblemount. Please include the route, snow level, any hazards encountered (or not), peak(s) attempted, and whether your party successfully summitted.\nAll of the climbing routes in the park complex are located in wilderness, but some are wilder than others, and there may be limited or outdated information. Use these reports as a baseline, but plan for changing conditions and a true adventure. On many routes, the discovery, physical stress, and route-finding challenges are half the fun.\nCascade River Road currently gated at MP 21, one mile beyond Eldorado parking lot. Road is snow free until about MP 22, near Boston Basin parking area. Cascade Pass is completely snow covered, with lots of natural avalanche activity (wet slides and point releases)."
