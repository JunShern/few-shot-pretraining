Below is a list of programs that support files with this extension. Just download one of them, then double click on the DMX-INFO file, which did not want to open and manually select the program installed by default. The DMX-INFO file should open now without any problem.\nIt can also happen that, despite the installation of one of the following programs, your DMX-INFO file will still return an error when you try to run it. In such a case, refer to the next part of our article, where we present solutions to most problems that may occur when you try to work with the new file extension, which is the DMX-INFO.\nRight-click the DMX-INFO file that we want to open, then clicking the option \"Open with\"\nIn this case, the solution may be to find another copy of the DMX-INFO file, to ask for another copy of it (if you got it from another person), or to try to download it again from the internet.\nIn this case, you must associate the DMX-INFO file with the application either by selecting the application (information here) or manually (information here).\nThe application for supporting the DMX-INFO file has not been entirely installed.\nYour computer does not have sufficient resources to the currently open the DMX-INFO file.\nWe install all the drivers that are needed to run the application that supports the DMX-INFO file.\nMost of the items on the registry concerning the DMX-INFO file are added automatically during installation of the program/application. In some situations, the user himself has to create a new registry entry, and type in the appropriate value. This method can be used to associate a file type with an existing application. Then locate the ProgID of the application in the registry. To access the Windows registry editor - click \"Start\", type \"regedit\", and then press ENTER.\nTo associate the DMX-INFO file type with the new application, you must define the ProgID for a particular application and if you want to get information on defining a new ProgID, you should see the program identifiers. For information about file extensions and its associations with applications look in the key HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT .\nHave you ever got a file that you could not open? Probably the situation was that it had an extension not used before on your computer, e.g. DMX-INFO. Such a situation could also take place with other extensions, but it always ended the same - giving you a headache when determining which program should be used to properly open the file.\nTypically, Windows has the appropriate software to open the DMX-INFO file or just preview its contents. Often, however, there is no such software, and then we need to identify what kind of file it is, and download the appropriate software to support it."
