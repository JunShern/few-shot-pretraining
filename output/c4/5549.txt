Parents will be notified if their child falls into either of those categories.\nOnce a potential candidate for SOAR has been identified parents will be asked to complete a \u201cPermission to Evaluate\u201d form authorizing KCFS to undertake a multi-disciplinary evaluation of their child. This evaluation will be conducted under a process prescribed by the state of Pennsylvania and will include an evaluation of the student by the KCFS certified school psychologist.\nIQ scores are not the sole factor for determining admission to SOAR. Students who score slightly below or above the benchmarks established for the program may be admitted if they demonstrate characteristics such as advanced creativity, exceptional performance in one area of study or specific subject, i.e. Math, or other recognized attributes of gifted or highly talented students.\nThe BSJPII principal will, after close consultation with the Gifted Program teacher, make the final decision regarding a student\u2019s admission into SOAR."
