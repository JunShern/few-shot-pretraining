I've not got many models in airworthy condition at the moment (certainly not ones that take up a minimum of space) other than my Jibe2, and Unicorn wing. Both of these are electric, but both fly off the slope really nicely (the jibe in strong winds, the Unicorn in not so strong winds).\nAnyway, I'll be staying not too far from Hayle (Tehidy), so I was wondering if there are any good sites for flying/sloping that I should head to in particualr winds? I've hear St Agnes is pretty good, but anywhere else?\nsquirmish has his own thread going at the mo, he's staying about 5 miles away from tehidy, your even better placed with the A30 just a few hundred yards away to go where ever you want.\nalso www.rcflyers.net for the local power site, about 2 miles away.\nwww.xcweather.co.uk pretty accurate up to a week ahead."
