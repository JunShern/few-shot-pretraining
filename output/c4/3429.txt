    "text": "Houston, Texas (April 27, 2010) \u2013 A free workshop for energy executives detailing how to move process improvement closer to the CEO\u2019s office is scheduled for May 24 at the second annual Energy Forum for Process Excellence.\nThe workshop is a complimentary session within the four-day energy forum produced by iSixSigma Live! and presented by SSA & Company. The conference runs May 24-27 at The St. Regis Houston.\nThe good news is that many energy companies are utilizing process improvement designed for today\u2019s competitive and complex business environment \u2013 they\u2019re applying fewer resources and providing faster results than in years past, with global operations rapidly aligning around a central strategy. The bad news is that most business improvement senior executives are still too far away from the CEO\u2019s office \u2013 literally and figuratively \u2013 to allow PI to deliver fully on its promise. If process improvement isn\u2019t a core component of a CEO\u2019s strategic plan, then it is under-serving the corporation and its shareholders.\nHandpicked Content : Excel Partnership's Six Sigma program drives your organization out of the box to new levels of performance excellence.\nIn this session, attendees will learn how to embed business improvement more deeply into their company\u2019s overall strategic plan, and what the exponential returns will be for their CEO and corporate shareholders when they do. In reviewing these case studies and processes first-hand, attendees come away with an understanding of the transformational potential of locating process improvement in the corner office (or at least closer than it is today).\nIf you are interested in attending the four-day Energy Forum, see the complete agenda at: http://live.isixsigma.com/events/forum/houston/2010/agenda.html. The Forum features master class workshops, two days of conference sessions and a half-day of site tours, as well as two networking receptions.\nThe Energy Forum\u2019s presenting sponsor, SSA & Company (http://www.ssaandco.com), has shown some of the world\u2019s leading corporations how placing process improvement in the strategic plan at the CEO level improves culture, performance, margins and returns."
