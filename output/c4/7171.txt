    "text": "Cooking With Melody \u00bb What\u2019s in your Harvest Bowl?\nWhat\u2019s in your Harvest Bowl?\nThe air is cooler and the warm fall colors are here, its harvest season. The meaning of harvest is the gathering of a crop. Sitting in the center of my kitchen island is a big decorative bowl that I use to fill with my daily harvest. Acorn, butternut, pumpkin, kacocha, and spaghetti squashes; Pineapples, bananas, lemons and oranges is what I have in my harvest bowl today.\nYou may have a similar type of bowl or basket in your kitchen. If you don\u2019t I recommend that you start one of your own. There are many different types of bowls or baskets that you can find to fit your needs and style of your kitchen. There are metal, wire, woven or wooden materials as well as two or three tiered standing baskets that you may prefer.\nWhat I enjoy most about having a harvest bowl is to present what is growing in our garden and what foods are in season. It\u2019s a reminder of what I have available to prepare meals with daily. A harvest bowl is decorative and colorful, a place to store your fruits that need ripening, and serves as good storage. When the harvest bowl starts to look bare I know it\u2019s time to visit the garden or take a trip to the market!\nGrowing a harvest of my own has taught me to appreciate the fruits and vegetables that we have available throughout the year. Many times we take for granted all of the food we have available to us at all times. In some countries around the world people cook with what\u2019s available to them that given day. I\u2019ve learned to cook with what I have available and prepare them in many different and creative ways. If you don\u2019t grow your own fruits and vegetables at home (I absolutely still make frequent stops to the market for various items) test you\u2019re cooking skills and experiment with new seasonal fruits and veggies. The taste is best when in season and the prices are usually cheaper. There is always something in our harvest bowl. What\u2019s in yours?\nWhat can you put in your Harvest Bowl?\nBe sure to sign up for the CookingwithMelody.com email newsletter to receive the latest updates!"
