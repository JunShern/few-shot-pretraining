    "text": "We live in a world where some people are really athletic and some are super smart. Other people are funny, and still others possess great wealth. Some can sing and others dance. Some are good at communicating and others at peacemaking. Some can cook, some can host, and others can sew. There are so, so many gifts that God uniquely distributes to each and every one of His children. At Grace, we are grateful for all of the gifts God gives to each of us, but we know that it is not our particular gifts that make any one of us great. Our greatness comes when we discover our gifts (whatever they may be) and use them to serve and bless others.\nWe find no satisfaction or joy in comparing who we are or what we have or don\u2019t have with each other. We have no time for trying to be something or someone we are not. Our collective aim is to live into the very best versions of ourselves that we can. We want to discover how God made us, grow comfortable in our own skin, and then together pour out our lives for the sake of others. We want to be agents of healing and hope and transformation in our families, our communities, and in our world that so desperately needs it.\nIf you would like to join us and use what God has uniquely given you in order to be a blessing to others, you can contact us at 732.542.7373 or at information@gracechristianchurch.com and set up an appointment to talk about how you might be able to get involved in the exciting things that are happening at Grace and beyond."
