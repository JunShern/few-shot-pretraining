    "text": "What is Through the Woods?\nHello and howdy, people and others.\nWe just looked at our very sadly neglected website and realised it\u2019s been around seven months since the last blog post. That\u2019s crazy! We\u2019ve decided it\u2019s time for us to get back up and kick the horse, as the saying goes.\nTo re-introduce ourselves back into polite society, the first thing we\u2019re going to do is the most simple thing we can think of; re-introduce you to our game, Through the Woods. What is it? What does it do? Where can you find it in the wild? All these questions and more will be answered henceforth. It\u2019s difficult to know how much of the game to reveal before release, so we\u2019ll just see how it goes.\nAll kinds of Norse creatures can be found in the forest. Or they can find you.\nWhat is Through the Woods about?\nThrough the Woods is a third-person horror adventure game about how far a mother would go to save her son. At the beginning of the game, Espen and his mother are at their summer cabin by a lovely lake. You wake up in the morning to find your son gone and you go outside to search for him. Down by the old pier, you witness Espen being pulled into a boat by an old man who rows him across the lake and into the fog. In desperation, you swim after them and find yourself in a forest on the island where the game takes place.\nThe objective of the game is to find your son and to discover the identity of the mysterious man who took him, and, more importantly, why he took your son. You will also learn a a lot about the history of the island and the strange and sometimes horrific things the old people who once lived there had to do to survive.\nWhat is the gameplay actually like?\nWe usually describe the gameplay of Through the Woods as similar to Gone Home mixed with a little Amnesia.\nYou explore the environment, finding any clues you can as to where you son is, while trying to avoid being killed by the various creatures that roam the woods.\nWe decided pretty early in development that combat was not really going to be a part of the game. We have gone back and forth on this over the last year or so but stuck to our guns on the combat. There are certain creatures who don\u2019t like the light of your torch, and there is a section of the game where you have to keep some creatures at bay with a certain object, but physical combat is not what this game is about.\nThis is a terrified woman who is forcing herself to cross this terrible place with the sole intention of finding her son. Some of the creatures in the game are vicious and as big as rhinos, so a heavy sword or a chunk of wood is not going to do much good. Sneaking and avoiding being spotted is the way to go. There are certain aspects of the character that do become stronger as the game goes on, but physicality is not part of it, and we are all happy with that.\nHow is the story delivered?\nJournals \u2013 There are dozens of journals scattered across the island that tell the history of the island and Erik, the man who kidnapped your son.\nDialogue \u2013 There is a running dialogue over certain parts of the game, recorded by the mother after the events of Through the Woods. It is not clear to whom she is speaking or why, but she talks about how she was feeling during her ordeal and the player is filled in on some of the history of the relationship between her and her son.\nRunes \u2013 These are written in various places, and always on the large standing runestones that act as the game\u2019s checkpoints. You can see one below. Stian, our very talented character artist, is actually pretty fluent in old Norse runes and has translated the English text into Norwegian, then into Norse runes. Sometimes the text was translated directly from Norwegian into Norse runes, as Stian wrote some of the checkpoint poems himself. It\u2019s pretty nerdy, but nice for those who think it\u2019s fun to figure this stuff out. The text on the runestone in the image below says, \u2018Myrkstad, i skogens skygger. Beskytt oss mot ham, Hels eget avkom\u2018. And in English; \u2018Myrkstad, in the forest shadows. Protect us from him, Hel\u2019s own offspring\u2018.\nEnvironment \u2013 There is also a bunch of environmental storytelling in the game, some of which is up to the player to figure out for themselves, and some of which goes together with perhaps a journal somewhere that might help with some context.\nFully translatable runes! You can translate them into old Norse, and then into English. Fun!\nWhat kind of enemies will I encounter? Can I die?\nThe game is full of creatures. You will be killed. Probably a lot.\nSo hopefully players will know that they need to use their flashlight to scare the secret creature away.\nThe stages and pacing of the game is also set up in a very interesting way, but I think we might be keeping that under wraps for the time being. We may discuss it more, but it\u2019s difficult to tell at this point whether revealing it will enhance or detract from the experience. Suffice it to say it adds a very interesting subtext to what the mother is going through.\nOk, you made it this far! Thanks very much for staying with us. Hopefully reading this will make people understand why, when people say to us, \u2018So, it\u2019s a bit like Slender, is it?\u2019 we recoil against the comparison so much! Through the Woods is a carefully thought out and crafted game that we hope people will enjoy and get lost in!\nThrough the Woods releases in September and you can add it to your wish list on Steam right now!\nThanks again! Until next time!\nKickstarter T-Shirt Options for Backers!\nI am very excited for this!\nWhat are the system requirements likely to be?"
