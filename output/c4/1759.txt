    "text": "DARK MATTER Season 3 Finale Review \"Nowhere to Go\"\nIT\u2019S HAPPENING. IT\u2019S HAPPENING; EVERYBODY CALM DOWN.\nWe open right where we left off: Ryo in his Glass Cell of Villainy, Two with her gun raised. Ryo attempts to make it easier for Two to kill him, but Two\u2019s moral dilemma rages on. She\u2019s interrupted by Six. They got a subspace message from Teku.\nTeku asks for Two to return the Emperor. Three replies that Ryo isn\u2019t emperor anymore, and Teku forcefully states that he is the rightful heir to Ishida, and they want him back.\nTeku informs them that he\u2019s brought a fleet with him\u2014maybe to sweeten the deal. As the crew issue their grievances, Teku assures them that he knows Ryo was less morally bankrupt than they imagine. Guessing they need a cherry on top, he also notes that he tracked Boone as a precaution\u2026right back to an off-grid base.\nBegrudgingly the crew agrees to stay Ryo\u2019s execution, albeit temporarily. Two questions Ryo\u2019s affection for Teku, and Ryo replies that Teku is the most honorable man he knows. Three doesn\u2019t like the situation, and Two isn\u2019t much happier with it, but she knows it\u2019s worth investigating.\nSix visits Five to ask how she is. Five\u2019s disturbed by half their crew voting to kill Ryo\u2014and also something she learned from Ryo. She reveals that she was looking for her sister when she stole the Blink Drive on Eridani-6. In the end, her sister came to meet her on the station\u2014along with her mother, Alicia Reynaud.\nThree visits Sarah\u2019s Personal Holodeck, now (of course) minus Sarah. Bereft of her presence, there\u2019s something oddly stale about it, even with the greenery. Does he have a sense of regret over the things he can\u2019t remember?\nOn the bridge, Android shows them onscreen the complex where Boone\u2019s ship is located\u2014only to reveal Project Phoenix.\nSpurred into action, they realize that their one ship can\u2019t possibly take on the secret Ferrous Corp fleet. Two suggests they call on Mikkei to lend a hand. Truffault helpfully reminds them that the Blink Drive makes the Raza the only ship in the galaxy able to surpass the exclusion field. Truffault suggests a summit, but brings a whitehole device along with her, revealing that they\u2019re allied with Traugott now. She proposes that the Raza gang use the whitehole device to destroy the entire complex\u2014and everyone on it. On the grounds that many more people will die if they don\u2019t. They agree.\nThey use the Blink Drive with the Marauder to bypass the exclusion field and drop the bomb successfully, but as Six attempts to blink out, the Marauder completely fails.\nThey are, of course, taken hostage.\nBack on the Raza, Five and Android realize something\u2019s wrong. Truffault discovers it was a double-cross\u2014they were set up by Traugott. The good news: the bomb won\u2019t kill our gang. The bad news: everything else.\nTruffault bails, as she is wont to do.\nOn the station, Six and Three are escorted into a holding cell as Two is taken aside to a chamber where a blunt scientist orders her to tell her everything she knows. Two insists she really knows nothing\u2014all Blink work was Android\u2019s doing. The scientist assures Two that she knows everything\u2014more than she knows\u2014and she\u2019ll share it.\nThree and Six are reunited\u2014unhappily\u2014with Wexler. He assures them that Commander Nieman will join them soon. Unexpectedly, Wexler saves them from the guard\u2026and then reveals that he\u2019s Truffault\u2019s contact. Wexler convinces them that the only way off the station is if they take down the field\u2014and, bargaining for his own life, points out that he\u2019s the only one who knows where the control room is.\nWexler and Three shoot their way into the control room where Wexler astonishes Three by coming up with a way to circumvent the field.\nSix rescues Two, but warily\u2014he suspects he\u2019s bringing Portia Lin back.\nAs Three and Wexler head for the Marauder, Wexler realizes he\u2019s slightly miscalculated how long they\u2019d have before the alarm sounds\u2026and promptly bails on Three. Or, more accurately, he runs as Three shoots.\nA few guards report back to the blunt scientist, and she assures them that Commander Nieman will not be pleased. As they exit, however, she gives a slight smile as her eyes cloud over, going totally black.\nThe Marauder and Raza reconnect, minus Three. Two berates Truffault, urging her to act. Truffault offers a half dozen ships\u2014maybe. Two says she can do better, and seeks out Ryo.\nTwo tells Ryo that Teku has a fleet\u2014enough for him to start a move towards taking back the empire. She asks if he has an alliance with Ferrous Corp, and he denies it\u2014it was a one-time deal with Nieman, nothing more. Two considers it, and offers him a deal: if he pledges the fleet, then she\u2019ll help him win the war.\nBack on the station, Three\u2019s being kept company by the ever-charming Portia Lin. Meanwhile, Ryo informs Teku of the plan\u2014not to retake the empire, but to deal Ferrous Corp a death blow.\nAs the crew preps for battle, though, something is not quite right with our wonderful Two. That\u2019s right, she too is now host to one of the dimension-hopping Cthulhus.\nBut the attack begins as planned, with Mikkei, the Ishida fleet, and the Raza all engaging Ferrous in a space brawl. On the station, Portia escorts Three to safety. The battle turns against them, and Two tells Android to rig the Marauder so that the Blink Drive goes critical and swallows the station. Just then Three calls them to let them know he\u2019s escaping to safety\u2014with Portia, improbably. Two goes to prepare the Blink Drive, and\u2014to the annoyance of her new possessor\u2014Android comes along.\nOut of sight of the bridge, Not Two shoots Android. Paralyzed, Android asks simply, \u2018why?\u2019 Not Two replies that it\u2019s the beginning of a new age.\nTwo hails the bridge, faking that a relay surge put Android out of order. She says they need someone to pilot the Marauder, and Three volunteers. Horrified by the implications, Five refuses to let him, begging him not to go. Six tells her that he has to go, and apologizes. He leaves the panicking Five with Wexler.\nSix boards the Marauder and begins his suicide run towards the station as more and more Ferrous Corp ships drop out of FTL. On the bridge, Five\u2019s console shuts down as Android remotely relays a simple message\u2014TWO COMPROMISED. Five tries to contact Six, but has no response.\nAt last, she turns to Ryo.\nFive frantically hails Six, but the message doesn\u2019t get to him in time. With a stoic goodbye, he activates the drive, opening a massive space-time anomaly.\nOkay, okay. I\u2019ll try to be reasonable.\nDark Matter has a thing for killer cliffhangers, but this one is especially nooooo inducing. So many questions! Where are Three and Portia? Six isn\u2019t really dead, right? Will Android reboot? Is Wexler part of our team now? Can we start calling Ryo Four again?\nAs far as cliffhangers go, though, this is a good one. I was pleasantly surprised by the diversion away from Ryo\u2019s villainy, and I hope that Season 4 will let out crew be a family again (please. please, they deserve happiness.). Two\u2019s possession by the Cthulhu creature/Goo Monster is troubling, though\u2014what lies ahead there?\nThis finale posed more questions than it provided answers, but it did so in a way that felt organic and kept the flow of the narrative moving briskly, right until the end. It\u2019s not that loose ends were left dangling so much as they were reabsorbed into the wider plot, trickling into the great sea of Season 4."
