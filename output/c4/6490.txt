    "text": "Audemars Piguet managed to impress everyone by coming out with this lovely Arnold Schwarzenegger watch, apparently a watch that was made in limited edition for him. The series also included T3 and End of Days as watches so everybody who was a fan or simply liked the design was allowed to buy these pieces. However, this series, called The Legacy is very limited as it only contains about 1,500 watches, so if you want one, you should probably hurry. Another interesting thing about these watches is the fact that the money will be going to a charity foundation so it\u2019s definitely a good thing to buy a watch if you want to help. Also, let\u2019s not forget the fact that being a limited edition, this watch will have a better and better value in time, so don\u2019t see it as just buying an accessory, see it as an investment.\nThe design of the watch is definitely timeless, you can easily see the beautiful curves on the watch and the stylish approach the lead designer Octavio Garcia managed to do on this piece. Also, it seems that the design is definitely more simple than in other years and each focus is on the bigger details rather than the smaller ones, as we were used to. Also, the watch contains amazing high tech materials like titanium, ceramic and gold, so you will certainly get value for your money. If you were wondering about its size, the 48mm wide would make it a big watch so it\u2019s only suitable for men with bigger wrist and it will surely stand out. The ceramic bezel has a beautiful finish that looks polished and brushed but also has some lovely set titanium elements that make the watch stand out even more. Also, the hour indicators and a lot of parts and details of the watch are made of gold, which gives it an interesting touch and a nice look overall. Also, the watch features automatic chronograph movement.\nThis is definitely an exquisite watch and behind it there\u2019s a wish to make some people\u2019s life better so you are not just investing in a wonderful accessory, you are helping through charity."
