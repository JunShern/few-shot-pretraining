    "text": "1. Never place a water feature such as swimming pool, spa, pond(s) or water fountain(s) without consulting with a Certified Feng Shui Consultant. Water placed in the wrong sector can lead to serious health problems or financial losses.\n2. Dead trees or bushes should be removed immediately. Make sure that the trunk is removed or covered with soil.\n3. Trees, sharp corners, utility poles, fire hydrant and posts should not be aligned with the front door. This restricts the Chi from entering your dwelling.\n4. Pathway to the front door should be curved to allow Chi to meander and bring beneficial Chi.\n5. Avoid placing the fire element such as a BBQ or a fire pit in the North West sector of the yard. This direction represent the trigram Qian/Chein, the element of metal, the father or owner of a company, as well as certain body parts such as the lungs, head, nose and intestine. Placing any of these fire elements including the color red, orange, purple and pink is not beneficial to the father, husband or owner/CEO of a corporation.\n6. The back of your garden or site should have a virtual or real mountain for support and financial backing. Virtual could be trees or a taller dwelling.\n7. Avoid trees such as weeping willows to close to the dwelling or front door, as well as plants with thorns to avoid unpleasant incidents.\n8. It is best to have a lot that is either square or rectangular. If the site is uneven use landscaping to square it off.\n9. Electric power poles and wires can upset our body Chi. The solution is to place a pile of round stones in that area. The round stones will absorb the negative Chi which isproduced by the electric power poles.\n10. Wrought iron or wood fences should not have sharp and jagged tops. This creates \u201cpoison arrow\u201d, detrimental to the health, relationships and wealth of the residents.\nCascading waterfalls, bells, chimes and bamboo flutes all add soothing sounds to the garden. They serve to stimulate stagnant or beneficial Chi or disperse the flow of \u201cpoison arrow\u201d. Don\u2019t forget to plant flowers that will attract butterflies and birds. These are wonderful creatures of nature that creates beneficial Chi and add endless hours of delightful pleasures of our senses."
