    "text": "If you live in Central Florida, you\u2019re aware that Hurricane season is upon us and that the upcoming months are the most active of all. Hurricanes are virtually unpredictable, so it\u2019s important to be prepared for heavy rain, damaging winds and debris. Here are some precautions to keep in mind when preparing for this hurricane season and what you can do to provide your HVAC system with proper protection for riding out any storm.\nTake Cover. Lets say a major storm is about to impact your area and might possibly have severe effects. Shutting down your HVAC air conditioning system as well as turning off the power it is sourced from is necessary. This will protect your system from flooding as well as any power surges from severe thunder and lightning. Not many people realize it, but you should also cover your HVAC system with a tarp to save it from any flying debris falling onto it and damaging it.\nPost-Storm. You may think when a hurricane is over, you can simply just plug everything back in and start running it like usual; this way of thinking is incorrect. After a storm, there are still many precautions you need to take in order to make sure you and your family are safe. Before you decide to flip the switch and turning your unit on, it is wise to have an HVAC professional come out and take a look to confirm nothing has happened to your system that could be dangerous. Some examples of post-storm side effects include: water in your HVAC system, electrical lines damaged and or debris/contaminants stuck in the duct or fan.\nIf you happen to be a victim of a damaged HVAC system due to mother nature, contact ABC Air and Heat to replace or repair your HVAC unit.\nThe post Hurricane Season and Your HVAC System appeared first on ABC Air Conditioning & Heating Specialist, Inc.."
