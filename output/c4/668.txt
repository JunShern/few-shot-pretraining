    "text": "These creative nursery colour schemes are guaranteed to get you thinking outside the (toy) box.\nNurseries are a fantastic opportunity to have some fun with your decorating scheme, and playing around with colour is a great place to start.\nOur experts have chosen five inspiring colour combinations that are guaranteed to get your creative juices flowing.\nWarm and passionate, citrus colours are incredibly striking when teamed with understated cool neutrals. Think juicy hues of lemon yellow, orange fizz, kiwi green and blood orange.\nEven a small dose of these bright colours will create an atmosphere bursting with youthful energy to match the little person who\u2019ll be living in the room.\nIf you\u2019re new to decorating with bold colours, why not try before your buy using the Dulux Visualizer app?\nIt gives you an instant impression of how your room will look once it\u2019s been painted and is really easy to use. Simply hold your Smartphone or tablet up to the wall you want to paint, choose any colour from the Dulux paint palette and tap the screen to make the colour appear on your wall.\nIf you think blue and green should never be seen, think again! Grass green and sky blue not only make for a wonderful nature-inspired colour palette, they\u2019re also calming hues that will bring a sense of tranquillity to your baby\u2019s surroundings.\nThe colours contrast beautifully, as blue gives a real sense of space and freedom, while green adds depth and warmth.\nWhy not paint your walls green and your ceiling blue to echo the way the colours appear in nature?\nPink is still a go-to hue for many parents expecting a girl, but if you want to think outside the box, why not try pairing bright pink with turquoise? These colours may seem like a bold combination but when used sparingly they\u2019re surprisingly appealing.\nFor a preppy look, pair an emerald green with a soft, muted pink like blush or dusty rose. Want to make a serious statement? Choose a moss green for the walls and ceiling and paint one wall in a brilliantly hot pink like fuchsia or orchid.\nGive vibrant and uplifting aqua an urban edge by pairing it with a warm muted green. This modern colour combination is perfect for parents who are waiting to find out the gender of their child, or for those who want to create a timeless nursery space.\nCombine with furniture in natural tones, such as brown and white, for an easy-to-live-with look that/s also timeless.\nGive pastels a modern edge by pairing them with a soft shade of brown. When choosing the pastel hues, think candy colours: soft pink, lemon and blueberry. Alone, these shades have the potential to look saccharine, but when paired with a warm neutral, like mocha, chocolate or latte, they take on a modern, sophisticated feel.\nCandy coloured pastels also look fabulous when paired with lots of white and warm wood tones, like oak and timber.\nIf you\u2019re still struggling to choose your paint, why not pick a theme for your nursery and the colours will follow naturally? For example, a woodland theme suggests green paint, while a seaside scheme suggests blue and yellow."
