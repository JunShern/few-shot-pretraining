    "text": "Inspiring bridges of understanding that celebrate diversity!\nBy visiting the F.I.R.E. website and social media site(s) you agree to the following terms and conditions.\nF.I.R.E. offers a variety of earth-based religious observances and celebrations. Our ceremonies and gatherings are inclusive to those who revere Nature, the earth, and all related energies as integral elements of their religious and spiritual path.\nLearn more about our services/events and what you can expect on our EVENTS page.\nThe Fellowship of Interconnected Religious Equality\u2019s purpose is dedicated to cooperative partnerships and creating a safe haven where people of Spirit can worship, learn, and teach in harmonious companionship.\nWe are here to strengthen our community through the observance of spiritual and religious practices, through education, and encouraging acceptance for all within our community. We look to support everyone who comes to our organization with our many years of clergy experience and with a deep love for all.\nWe are an interfaith community and church that is inclusive to all earth-based faiths and practices for the purpose of unifying our communities and establishing respect for our communities within society.\nF.I.R.E. is a place where marginalized earth-centered faiths can worship and practice in a safe and open-minded environment. We offer religious and spiritual support to those who look to connect with others of like mind.\nWe work to help eliminate the deeply ingrained, negative and limiting ideas and beliefs that are often associated with Paganism, and other \u201calternative\u201d religious practices. We challenge and dissolve mindsets that keep good people fearfully hidden away from the larger religious community and general society. We are a community that openly engages other communities in education, shared leadership, tolerance, acceptance, and understanding.\nFIRE is a secure and transparent community when it comes to the expectations of our members as well as its clergy. We work to provide a safe haven for souls so that they might freely seek their personal spiritual path. We work to establishment codes of ethical standard and conduct that help us in our efforts to create and maintain wellbeing and autonomy for all. F.I.R.E. is a community that is styled in a circular rather than pyramid structure; inviting clergy and master/mistresses of various areas of theological study to share their traditions and wisdom with the community.\nOur board serves as a necessary element of administration in maintaining the organization\u2019s primary vision while serving the administrative needs of our organization. We welcome qualified clergy and teachers to come share on equal footing without ego, as we sit at the Round Table of Spirit.\nWe are passionate about leaving a communal legacy for the next Generation.\nThis is a religious and spiritual organization where seekers can learn the truth about various earth-base faiths, and practices. This organization serves as a church for spiritual exploration, enlightenment, and understanding in an open and non-judgmental atmosphere.\nF.I.R.E. will work to unite earth-based faiths and serve this community through offering public events, education, and as a bridge of trust and understanding between our faiths and the greater community.\nEarth-based spirituality and religious practices are the first religion. Since the beginning of time earth based religious and spiritual practices have been an interwoven component of humanity. Our connection with Nature is infinite. Nature is part of the fabric of our being. We are not set apart from nature, instead, we are nature.\nIt is the belief of this Church that no one doctrine (such as the Koran or Bible) dictates the beliefs of the individual or the church. Instead, it is the individual and those of clergy status who are called to recognize Divinity and religious worship as he or she is called. Nature offers the followers of this path all the necessary and adequate governing laws as dictated by the cycles of nature, solar cycles, lunar cycles, and ethical social behaviors.\nThe presence and appearance of Divinity, God, Goddess and the like come in many forms and especially manifests itself in nature, the universe and all natural things. Divinity will manifest itself to the individual in the form that is best perceived by the individual. Therefore, the Gods will manifest in various forms.\nHumanity and nature are infinitely connected. Nature is not separate from man, as man is nature just as the trees, rivers, and stones of the Earth are nature. Nature and all natural things are sacred to all who follow earth-based spiritual and religious paths.\nWe believe in the reverence of Nature as we see Divinity in all; including our kin. Nature is our creator and we are made of the essence of the Universe. Man and Nature are not seen as separate entities, rather they are one in the same.\nThe Church will act as a conduit for and as a representation of earth-based faiths and will recognize and honor each individual perspective of earth-based spiritual and religious practices.\nStewardship to one another, the Earth and all who depend on the Earth is essential to the practice of earth-based spiritual and religious practices. We will do what it is within our power and capacity to help the earth heal and thrive as we work to preserve its resources. We view the Earth as our one and only home and our mother from whom all things are born. We will treat this Mother Goddess, known as Mother Earth (and by many more names), with respect and gratitude. Many of our observances and celebrations are in relation to planting and harvest festivals, making the earth, the soil and the foods and plants we grow a scared element of our practices. We also revere the animals who sustain us as they depend on the earth for nourishment and survival.\nWe regularly congregate, observe and celebrate our faiths in accordance to the solar and seasonal cycles, moon cycles, and other nature cycles; including planting and harvest festivals. All worship and religious and spiritual practices should be conducted within a natural surrounding whenever conditions allow. When specific conditions (relate to weather, space, location and other factors) prevent the congregation from practicing within nature, an indoor alternative is acceptable.\nWe believe that personal development, growth, and introspection is essential to developing as a human, as a spiritual seeker, and in developing a spiritual connecting with nature. As we spend time in meditation and in nature we learn more about the rhythms of natural cycles inside and outside of ourselves. During this time of personal development and improvement, we better connect with the spiritual energies surrounding us and guiding our lives."
