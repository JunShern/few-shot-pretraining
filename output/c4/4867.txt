    "text": "This dip is for anyone who loves a gooey bacon cheeseburger! It\u2019s so creamy and addicting\u2026 serve it at a party and watch it disappear, quickly!!\nDoes it get much better than a great dip at a party? I don\u2019t know about you guys, but for me, the best part of a party is the food! Hanging out with great friends gets even more awesome when you\u2019re hanging out around a spread of amazing party food. Wings, finger foods, and dips!!\nI\u2019ve always been a sucker for a great dip. There are SO many flavor combinations! I can\u2019t take all the credit for this one though, I saw it on Delish and knew I had to try my hand at it.\nI added a little extra bacon, more cheese on top, and garnished with chopped dill pickles (my favorite part!!), and let me just say\u2026 WOW!!! This is one of those dips that you literally won\u2019t be able to just have one bite of\u2026 you\u2019re going to be going back for seconds, thirds, fourths, etc.\nFor all the party foods I share here on the blog, I might give off the impression that I live this grand life full of parties and gatherings. Not really lol. Since having kids, we\u2019ve settled down and prefer to either be with family, or hanging out here at home\u2026 which makes this introvert happy!! In years past, on Christmas Eve, we all would gather at my grandma\u2019s house and everyone brings an appetizer/snack food\u2026 and we all just graze and spend time together. If we do that this year, I know I\u2019ll be bringing this dip!!! Once it\u2019s baked, you could transfer it to a small slow cooker and keep it on warm.\nOur daughter\u2019s birthday is actually on New Years Eve, so that holiday is spent at home as a family\u2026 but I\u2019m going to start a new tradition where I\u2019ll make all of our favorite appetizers for dinner that night (plus her cake of course). Everyone loves an appetizer dinner right?!\nAs far as dippers go, I stayed with the potato chips (that salty crunch is so satisfying!), but some toasted baguette slices would work too! This bacon cheeseburger dip is gooey, cheesy, creamy, and incredibly delicious!! I hope you guys give it a try\u2026 whether it\u2019s for a party, game day, or even just as a fun snack to share.\nPeanut Butter Cup Cheesecake Dip \u2013 great for using up leftover Halloween candy!\nWANT TO TRY THIS CHEESEBURGER DIP?\nPreheat oven to 350 F degrees. Spray an 8 inch cast iron skillet or 1.5-2 qt baking dish with non-stick cooking spray and set aside.\nTo a large skillet, add bacon slices and cook over MED-LOW heat until browned and crispy. Remove to paper towel lined plate, reserving grease in skillet.\nIncrease heat to MED-HIGH. Add onions and cook until soft and translucent, about 4-5 minutes. Add ground beef, crumble and cook until cooked through, about 4-5 minutes. Transfer beef to another paper towel lined plate to absorb excess grease.\nWhen bacon is cool enough to handle, crumble. Add crumbled bacon, cooked hamburger and onion, cream cheese, 1 cup of the cheeses, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, salt and pepper to a large mixing bowl. Mix well.\nTransfer mixture to prepared skillet or baking dish, top with remaining 1/2 cup cheeses and bake until bubbly, about 12-15 minutes.\nTop cooked dip with diced dill pickles and a sprinkling of fresh parsley (if desired), and serve hot. I like to serve this with potato chips.\nComplete steps 2, 3, and 4 as directed. Next, transfer to a 2 quart slow cooker, sprinkle with remaining cheeses, cover, and cook on LOW for 3-4 hours or HIGH for 1 1/2 - 2 hours, or until warmed through and bubbly. Proceed with step 6 as directed.\nFor a large party, or if you have hungry guests, I suggest doubling the recipe.\nThe whole family loved this dip! Good with pita chips but even better with potato chips! Thanks for sharing!\nSounds great! Trying it tonight for the Super Bowl party.\nThis looks really good! A must-have for parties!!\nI know what I am making for this weekend\u2019s GNO!!!\nPass me the dip!! That sounds soooo good!\nWhat a delicious dip! Great for all the Football Parties!\nThis looks amazing and the combination of flavors is simply incredible. Love it!!\nI\u2019m a sucker for a good dip, and this looks amazing!\nThis is sure to become a party dip favorite! Looks addictive!\nWowza. This. Looks. Amazing. Nothing better than a fall saturday full of friends and gameday eats, amirite!? Can\u2019t wait to try this!\nWe love appetizer dinners! Everyone gets their favorite and it\u2019s so much fun! I\u2019ll definitely be adding this to the spread."
