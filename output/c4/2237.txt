    "text": "Krackerjack is coming along nicely. I have all the stars that will use done. I will be sewing them together today. The three on the left are together already. After that comes the auditioning of the secondary blocks which is part of the sashing.\nThis is one colorful project! See other projects at Patchwork Times. Happy Memorial Day.\nFirst to show is my purchase for this week. I picked these two fabrics up at Beverly's on Friday. The blue is to be the back for Koliding Krosses and the black is the final black fabric needed for the collection of 30 blacks for Winston Ways. I just about have all of Winston Ways cut and ready for October's Bonnie Hunter Workshop. I'll be taking two workshops the other will be Scrap Crystals.\nKrazy Krones was finished last week. This oh so adorable Buggy Barn design is called If the Hat Fits. I honestly think the noses look more like pickles...don't you? The quilting which is difficult to see is perfect. It is called Gossamer; a spider web. Kerry's Quilting did an awesome job with it. I'm ready for Halloween!\nKonqueror came home with me Friday. Kerry had it waiting for me. The fabrics aren't the brightest, but I do like how they all work together. I'll be attaching sleeve, binding, and label during the week. This is a pattern by Joyce Weeks of Geoff's Mom Pattern Company called Survivors. The quilting on it is called Shell Shock and thread is Signet Ring.\nKrackerjack is keeping me busy right now. There is a setting that goes between the star blocks. I have at least two more stars to assemble...depends on how many of the 2 1/2\" corner of the star blocks I can get out of this fabric. I have plenty of the white and the flower centers. We'll just have to see. Krackerjack is a pattern by Bloc Loc called Star Fusion.\nI'm working on Krazy Krones among several other projects :). Krazy Krones needs the swoosh between the star and the tip of the hat on each of the eight witches. I have six of them done right now. I'm using either gold or black pearl cotton thread depending on what background the witch has. The gray one in the photo will probably be gold. This project is the last of my Buggy Barn designs needing to be finished. I have some leftover blocks from Krazy Kattle and Krazy Krones that I plan to make into small wall hangings. I'm waiting on Julanne now for the next cute project to be instructed.\nI have some free sewing time left this month before the next UFO is announced; think I might pick up Krackerjack (aka Star Fusion by Jana Thomas). I haven't had opportunity to work on it since January. I'm real anxious to see this project finish.\nEnjoy all the link ups at Patchwork Times today! Have a wonderful week.\nGood day everyone! We are getting closer to normal in our beautiful town of San Diego. The fires have reeked havoc on us most of this last week. A few are still at evacuation centers, but they are being told that either today or at the latest if all conditions continue on the current plan should be back in their homes not later than Monday. Unfortunately there have been several who don't have homes to return to. So sad for them, a time to rejoice at what we have. For them, a time to rebuild. I wish the best for a speedy process.\nThere is a lot of cutting involved in the two workshops I am signed up for in October with Bonnie Hunter. I have finished Scrap Crystals and almost there with Winston Ways. I need a few more sets of blue, black, gold and neutral to finish. I have one more place to look at home and then Kerry's on Friday. We really get a break from enhancing and using our stashes when we shop from each other. When the time comes these two projects will really take yardage away from my stash.\nI do have a finish to claim this week. My UFO for May is complete. To be honest this is not a project I would be scrambling to want to make at this time. It has finished nicely. I plan to use the darkest of the blues for the binding. Not sure what I will select for a quilting thread or pattern. I suppose so many years ago my tastes in quilting designs was different...perhaps this is why I haven't been anxious to check this design off my want to do list. Well now I can thanks to Aunt Marti's 2014 UFO Challenge. You can see all my 2014 UFOs here.\nThis is the wall hanging from Newly Hatched pattern by Karen Brow. I took a workshop with her and members of Sunshine Quilt Guild on Saturday to learn Karen's techniques. There is a juvenile turtle to be done that will sit above and to the left of mama turtle. I'm prepping the applique pieces right now. I really enjoy Karen's workshop. If you have a chance check out her patterns at Java House Quilts. I'm hoping to have the juvenile done for Tuesday's monthly meeting where all the students will be sharing their project. Anyone have an idea on a \"K\" name for my turtle project?\nI know you want to see more, but it just can't be done... Here's just a small porting of my Whisper Challenge project. It's due at the June 10th meeting. I'm anxious to see how my interpretation of the photograph everyone started with plays out. There will be sharing after June 10th!\nThis is Koliding Krosses. I have all the pieces made. Time for putting the blocks together and then the rows. I'm right on track for an end of the month finish.\nThere is more to see today through the links at Patchwork Times.\nHappy Mother's Day! I hope you have treated your Mom right and for you that are Mom's your children are making a fuss over you. My brother and sister and I treated our Mom extra special starting on Wednesday and culminating with telephone calls today. Karen found time on Saturday to take Mom out to lunch and spend some time at a fabric shop. Wish I could have joined them, but 3,000 miles separate us. Mike is separated by 850 miles too or he'd have joined us at least for lunch. Mom knows we think of her always. She's the best! Soon she will be here visiting just a few short weeks away now. I'm pretty anxious for Mom HUGS!\nThese are my purchases this week. All five fabrics are 1/4 yard cuts. Two different projects needed just a bit more to complete them. The blue is for my May UFO that I'm calling Koliding Krosses. I am at the point with it where the blocks and rows need to be sewn together. Perhaps today will see it finish into a top. It would be nice to finish ahead of schedule. Like to get the projects with deadlines complete so I don't feel pressured. The three remaining fabrics are for my turtle wall hanging. I took a class with Karen Brow yesterday at Paradise Sewing in Poway. I want to work on this a bit today. Everyone who took the class will be sharing on Tuesday at Sunshine Quilt Guild meeting.\nThen there's the Whisper Challenge project I'm working on. And the cutting of Scrap Crystals for an October workshop with Bonnie Hunter adds to the business of my sewing room. See what others have been doing with their stash through the links at Patchwork Times. Have a wonderful day!\nI will share my design wall. Koliding Krosses is coming along very well. I want to add in another dark. I am thinking about a solid or one that reads that close. So far all of these fabrics are from my stash. I think the fabric I have in mind...if I can find it...will be what my #9 UFO needs. I share the designer/pattern information here. There is no border to be added. I have enough of he dark blue print that is in the blocks now for the binding. This month's project has been quick to assemble.\nSee other projects through the many links today at Patchwork Times.\nI am using up my stash, but not ready for any used statistics to change quite yet. The photo above goes to the Whisper Challenge project I'm working on. Certainly I can't tell you more!\nThese fabrics will be for my May UFO. You can check out #9 UFO to see the design. The coral and ivory will be my pop colors to float through the middle. I may need to dig a little deeper in my stash or I'll just end up making the quilt a bit smaller.\nThese last group of fabrics is for a workshop I will be taking on Saturday. It will be at Paradise Sewing in Poway with Karen Brow. I'll be making the cute wall hanging; mother turtle and her youngster. I do need to add in a white and turquoise dot to this collection for the turtle's tummys.\nHope you are enjoying your Sunday. See what others have been doing with their stash through the links at Patchwork Times."
