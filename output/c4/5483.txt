I quote the article: \"For example, Koppel's group found that the single biggest difference is that women are far more likely than men to use personal pronouns-''I'', ''you'', ''she'', ''myself'', or ''yourself'' and the like.\"\nDare I ask about the male/female ratio in STC? Please, no flames - at the stake or otherwise... Posing a question does not necessarily reveal the opinions of the poser.\nI have actually had clients tell me to pull all those personal pronouns out of my work because it was either too demanding (\"You\" don't have to do x, the design must incorporate x) or somehow struck the client as \"unprofessional\" or some such."
