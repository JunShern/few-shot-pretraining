Poor project planning can cost you: sometimes in the form of thousands of dollars, sometimes just in time and headaches, which can be just as bad. Get some examples of how poor project planning can cost you, and some tips on getting it right the first time.\nI often try to implement new processes or procedures in my car dealership based on customer or employee input. One of the processes I wanted to improve upon was the time it took for service customers to bring their cars in for service, communication on needed repairs, and an easy pick up when the vehicle was ready. Seems simple right? Well it wasn\u2019t!\nFirst off, I gathered the opinions and concerns from both employees and customers. I created a timeline of the way things were currently being done along with the suggestions on how to improve the entire process. I was sure my new process would be streamlined and keep the customers and my employees happy.\nOnce my service manager and I created the written policy, we reviewed it with our service employees. Even though we had obtained all of our service employees\u2019 input, one employee noted, \u201cWhat if the service manager is not available to take a customer\u2019s telephone call?\"\nYes, that \u201cwhat if\" did indeed occur! Upon this realization, suggestions were thrown at me and before I knew it, I had six different ideas on how this could be handled\u2014some good and some ineffective. At this point, I tried to implement an unnecessary element into my new service process\u2014after all, the service manager does go out to lunch! It didn\u2019t work out well because I tried to force a solvable element into a process that really didn\u2019t need this element!\nHence, my service manager and I went back to the drawing board to figure out the solution to this problem which could have been avoided if I would have analyzed my project in more detail. In essence, this service solution project failed and, until redeveloped, both my customers and my employees were affected.\nAnother real-life example of poor project planning is the introduction of the Chrysler PT Cruiser. While the Chrysler Corporation had the design, production, and advertising right on key, they didn\u2019t consider dealer showroom delivery times into the project equation.\nWhile top heads at Chrysler production plants fought about how to deal with this, they also received nasty phone calls from dealership owners who had their own ideas. The solution (an added, non-planned-for element) was to just ship out cars to any old rails in any old city and let the dealers figure it all out\u2014this, of course, did not work, revealing the importance of a good project plan.\nDeciding upon the best idea on delivery times and ensuring the much anticipated public turned the delivery of wanted PT Cruisers into a real-time nightmare. Dealers lost deposits and customers purchased cars from other automakers.\nIf product delivery schedules would have been included in the project scope, this debacle would have never happened. Avoiding the analysis of the delivery times harmed Chrysler\u2019s initial sales of the PT Cruiser.\nVision & Mission \u2013 Every project must possess a good vision and mission that is clear, concise, and understood by everyone involved in the project.\nWork Breakdown Structures (WBS) \u2013 A good WBS, if well written and reviewed, can determine just about every element of a project including items from initiation to testing to completion to delivery to market, as well as the project tasks that need to be completed.\nUser Stories \u2013 Although an Agile Management Methodology, user stories offered by clients, stakeholders and end-users can make a world of difference in determining every element of the project at hand.\nMilestones \u2013 You should create milestones within the project that can be reviewed when complete and compare the outcomes to your WBS and user stories. Don\u2019t proceed if milestones aren\u2019t clear or effective.\nIterations \u2013 Used in Six Sigma, iteration planning is often very effective. Once an individual team completes its iteration sprint, if it\u2019s not right, it goes back.\nCritical Path \u2013 Use a critical path method to find acceptable levels of project goals and milestones as well as those that are not acceptable or above or below the critical line of the chart.\nScheduling \u2013 Stick with a good scheduling plan and review it often to address concerns.\nStatus Meetings \u2013 You must employ regular status meetings to keep up to date with what every member of your team is doing. Make these mandatory.\nCommunication \u2013 Without an effective communication plan that is accessible to everyone, issues are bound to come up that you did not think of.\nIf you look back at your career, you can probably identify at least one project where unplanned obstacles derailed your goals. Use these steps to avoid problems, and if need be, run with a project scenario first to see what\u2019s not included, what shouldn\u2019t be included, and how best to fix the wanted or unwanted project elements."
