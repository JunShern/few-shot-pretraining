    "text": "Our 50cc Mini Moto range is based upon the Italian and Chec exotic race models. A budget based reproduction of these \u00a32000+ high-performance editions, these bikes are incredible value for money and produced for fun!\nWith a range of stylish themed decals, you can choose your colour and style.\nThe 49cc engine is reliable, easy start and with tuning modifications, power and speed can be easily doubled!\nThe excellent geometry means the bike steers, turns, and corners without fuss. Complementing the sweet handling are the performance racing tyres, better grip over standard tyres in either dry or damp conditions.\nTop speed depends on rider weight, but on average you should see 20-30mph with the bike in the standard specification. At just inches from the ground, it feels twice as fast!\nBoth standard and performance parts are available for this model.\nDespite being the highest quality in this product type, as a budget replica, please bear in mind that these bikes are produced for best value, and as such the finish will not be that of our higher priced ranges. It is not unusual to find blemishes, slight marks and scratches in the paintwork, and if you could please manage your expectations to suit the cost of the bike, you will not be disappointed.\nOverall Length 94cm, Width 49cm & Height 55cm. A seat height of 46cm. 60kg max rider weight and a top speed of 30mph based on weight and terrain."
