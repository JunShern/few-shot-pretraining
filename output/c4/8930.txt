Each toolkit focuses on topics that are critical to the \u2018me too.\u2019 Movement, ranging from clearly defining consent, to how to open discussions about sexual violence with your child. Each toolkit contains evidence-based research, journal prompts, and social media cards with snapshots of sexual violence data.\nFind resources for survivors and advocates near you."
