Here\u2019s a few tiny pumpkin shacks/houses to get you in the mood- its actually amazing how many people go this route when carving theirs\u2026.. Enjoy!\nAgain, I\u2019ll be looking for weird, fun, unusual, and self-built forts, shacks, tiny houses, tree houses, and playhouses for a new upcoming book- send photos of your builds (or the work of others that you\u2019ve captured) to kidcedar at gmail dot com.\nWell, aside from the natural light, the affordability, its light weight, ease of installation, the look (I love it, some don\u2019t), and the flexibility\u2026.this photo pretty much sums it up: THE VIEW, and the filtration of colored light you receive in the fall (my favorite season) is one of the main things I love. The brand I use, since many ask, is \u201cTUFTEX\u201d- the rest that I\u2019ve used, is crap by comparison. Of course, this stuff does have its downside too, its plastic (environmentally), and r-value wise its lousy- although GREAT for solar gain in the winter!\nThe cabin above is \u201cTHE GYPSY JUNKER\u201d, one of the micro cabins thats on the premises for our \u201cTiny House Building Workshop\u201d in MA this weekend. Its also featured in my book \u201cHumble Homes, Simple Shacks\u201d AND in the video below, which gives you a full tour!\nHere\u2019s a photo of the progress on my 64 square foot guest cabin/shack/house in my yard. I\u2019ve been working on it, and many other things, in preparation for this weekend\u2019s \u201cRelaxshacks.com Tiny-House Building (Hands-On) Workshop\u201d. THREE days of building, speakers, tiny house tours, demos, campfire discussions, and MORE!\nStill alot of work to go on this little house, but its a start! Right now, a certain lil\u2019 Hurricane is keeping me from getting any more done.\nAbove: The ANTI-CLASSROOM classroom\u2026..where we\u2019ll be hanging. This is the podium for most of our speakers and discussions\u2026.\nAnd\u2026.lumber n\u2019 windows galore, outside, and inside the shed- which we\u2019ll be using to build a tiny house on wheels\u2026.together!\nT-MINUS 5 days until our \u201cRelaxshacks.com Tiny-House Building (Hands-On) Workshop\u201d in Stoughton, MA- I can\u2019t wait, and have been prepping like mad! The weather is supposed to clear by the weekend too! No complaints here!\nPhotographically I just love this, and the overall idea is just fun/unique as well- its a floating sauna cube, where two holes serve as the access to this tiny space, and the means, or exit, to cool off. Yes, there is another entrance too, one you don\u2019t have to swim through\u2026.\nThis simple. yet artsy n\u2019 slick sweat shelter, was designed by Marco Casagrande, a man with a last name not befitting such a small structure\u2026.\nI not only like it as a sauna, but because of its potential to be a great tree house- one that would allow in lots of natural light!\nYou can barely see it in the photo above, but the wood stove IS strapped down to the structure by means of steel cables- this way, if a wave, of wake, were to upset and jostle the structure, the wood stove wouldn\u2019t tip over. Very smart.\nI\u2019ve been firing on all cylinders getting ready for next weekend\u2019s \u201cRelaxshacks.com Tiny House Building (Hands-On) Workshop\u201d here in MA, from pre-painting certain materials, to purchasing trailer-loads of lumber for our collective tiny-guest-house-on-wheels build, to just cleaning up and getting the micro-cabins on my lot up to speed (which usually means improving them, and getting carried away). Anyway, because of that, I\u2019ve had a little less time for the blog- my apologies, and part of it is because I\u2019m still recovering from three incredible days in NYC for the Tumbleweed Tiny House Workshop I hosted out there. While in NYC, I also shot two very cool little architecture/tiny dwelling videos too- which I\u2019ve also been working on.\nAnyway, in times like these, I love to just kick back (when I find a chance) and give my brain a rest and take a look through some of the photos I have saved on my computer, such as this one- today\u2019s EYE CANDY SHOT\u2026\u2026a sheep wagon interior. Its so fun, yet orderly, and still cozy looking overall.\nTHIS IS THE KINDA STUFF I\u2019M LOOKING FOR! Love this- and I\u2019m in search of more rustic, fun, less refined/stiff tiny houses, forts, tree houses, playhouses, and more (ones you built, or photographed yourself) for an upcoming, in-the-works, book on the very same subject. kidcedar at gmail dot com, if you\u2019re down.\nFile Under: Zoinks! Check out this cool little tiny house/escape in the trees. This micro cabin in the woods, was built and designed by Peter Bahouth. The photos are actually from a network of tree huts Peter has. Peter was the former executive director for Greenpeace USA, and is the current director of The US Climate Action Network.\nThis tree house uses a good deal of recycled materials, including 100-year-old windows taken from a Masonic Temple. The structures are also built so as to inflict minimal harm and damage to the trees that support them (always a great idea).\nThis treehouse was also recently featured in the book \u201cMy Cool Shed\u201d by Jane Field-Lewis- definitely worth a look- some great photos within! I\u2019ve linked it below.\nAlso, below, a recap post on two other NEW videos from this week too.\nALSO, my TINY HOUSE BUILDING WORKSHOP is next weekend! I can\u2019t wait!!!!"
