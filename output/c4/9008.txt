Blow the trumpet in Tekoa and raise up a signal on Beth Haccherem, for evil looks out from the north with a great destruction.\n2 - I will cut off the beautiful and delicate one, the daughter of Zion.\n3 - Shepherds with their flocks will come to her. They will pitch their tents against her all around. They will feed everyone in his place.\"\n4 - \"Prepare war against her! Arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe to us! For the day declines, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out.\n5 - Arise, and let us go up by night, and let us destroy her palaces.\"\n6 - For the LORD of Hosts said, \"Cut down trees, and cast up a mound against Jerusalem. This is the city to be visited. She is wholly oppression within herself.\n7 - As a well produces its waters, so she produces her wickedness. Violence and destruction is heard in her. Sickness and woundes are continually before me.\n8 - Be instructed, Jerusalem, lest my soul be alienated from you; lest I make you a desolation, an uninhabited land.\"\n9 - The LORD of Armies says, \"They will thoroughly glean the remnant of Israel like a vine. Turn again your hand as a grape gatherer into the baskets.\"\n10 - To whom should I speak and testify, that they may hear? Behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they can't listen. Behold, The LORD's word has become a reproach to them. They have no delight in it.\n11 - Therefore I am full of The LORD's wrath. I am weary with holding it in.\"Pour it out on the children in the street,and on the assembly of young men together;for even the husband with the wife will be taken,the aged with him who is full of days.\n12 - Their houses will be turned to others,their fields and their wives together;for I will stretch out my hand on the inhabitants of the land, says The LORD.\"\n13 - \"For from their least even to their greatest, everyone is given to covetousness.From the prophet even to the priest, everyone deals falsely.\n14 - They have healed also the hurt of my people superficially,saying, 'Peace, peace!' when there is no peace.\n15 - Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination?No, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush.Therefore they will fall among those who fall.When I visit them, they will be cast down,\" says The LORD.\n18 - Therefore hear, you nations, and know, congregation, what is among them.\n19 - Hear, earth! Behold, I will bring evil on this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not listened to my words; and as for my law, they have rejected it.\n20 - To what purpose does frankincense from Sheba come to me, and the sweet cane from a far country? Your burnt offerings are not acceptable, and your sacrifices are not pleasing to me.\"\n21 - Therefore the LORD says, \"Behold, I will lay stumbling blocks before this people. The fathers and the sons together will stumble against them. The neighbor and his friend will perish.\"\n22 - The LORD says, \"Behold, a people comes from the north country. A great nation will be stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth.\n23 - They take hold of bow and spear. They are cruel, and have no mercy. Their voice roars like the sea, and they ride on horses, everyone set in array, as a man to the battle, against you, daughter of Zion.\"\n24 - We have heard its report. Our hands become feeble. Anguish has taken hold of us, and pains as of a woman in labor.\n25 - Don't go out into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword of the enemy and terror are on every side.\n26 - Daughter of my people, clothe yourself with sackcloth, and wallow in ashes! Mourn, as for an only son, most bitter lamentation, for the destroyer will suddenly come on us.\n27 - \"I have made you a tester of metals and a fortress among my people, that you may know and try their way.\n28 - They are all grievous rebels, going around to slander. They are brass and iron. All of them deal corruptly.\n29 - The bellows blow fiercely. The lead is consumed in the fire. In vain they go on refining, for the wicked are not plucked away.\n30 - Men will call them rejected silver, because the LORD has rejected them.\""
