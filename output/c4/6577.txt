    "text": "Managing a huge and active guest blogging community is exciting. I never stop discovering new and new things.\nIn fact, the scam I am going to share today isn\u2019t new at all.\nIt\u2019s been around for ages, but considering I\u2019ve been involved in the content marketing for quite some time and have never seen this before, I\u2019ve figured it may be new to you as well.\nIf you accept guest articles or outsource content creation, you\u2019ll be as surprised to hear about this scam as I was. It\u2019s almost impossible to catch!\nDo these pieces look exactly the same?\nNote: If you select the source code in the second column and click \u201cView Selection Source\u201d, you are most likely to be unable to see the wicked symbols even there (the above screenshots are made from the HTML editor).\nLike Google, no duplicate content checker will ever recognize that line of text as a copy from the existing text.\nHow the Heck Could This Happen?\nHow Do I Detect the Scam?\nHow Can the \u201cAlien\u201d Characters Be Stripped?\nSimple. The text from the second column contains Cyrillic character \u201c?\u201d which looks exactly the same as the English \u201co\u201d but, taken from another language, it forms a new word.\nWYSIWYG editor \u2013 Our very-much-loved WordPress Editor not only fails to strip the alien characters (which is quite natural as who knows what they should be converted into), but also fails to signal about them in any way (it turns the corresponding code into normally-looking characters). So if you are using WordPress and copy-paste the text from the second column into the \u201cVisual\u201d editor, you won\u2019t notice anything. This makes the scam even more dangerous and easier to go away with. My WordPress even didn\u2019t highlight the words with foreign characters as errors.\nThe best advice here: search Google! Even if the article you are going to publish passes Copyscape, grab a long phrase from it and search for the exact match to make sure Google understands it.\nThese guys are clever \u2013 pitty they can\u2019t find a better outlet for their intelligence.\nGood thing I got this heads up quite early. Been wondering how some of obviously copied articles still come up clean on plagiarism checks. Will look out for this one from now on.\nNice catch,Ann! This is a new one to me. As Keith said, what a shame they can\u2019t put their brain to better use.\nI\u2019d expect that Google would be able to easily detect such tricks, if they consider it worthy of their attention. Since there\u2019s little chance of any organic SEO benefit from such tactics, though, I suspect the most likely purpose is to bilk buyers of articles. Though dropping a link on someone else\u2019s blog is certainly a possibility.\n@Doc, Google is already best at identifying the scam (this is why I encourage everyone to search Google). But many people buying content and accepting guest posts may be unaware of the fact they are publishing nonsense! Unless they search Google, they will never be able to find out.\nAnd you\u2019d be surprised how well the scam is spread already. Several people in the thread I linked to above said, they had come across such scammers once or twice!\nSo the flip side is, someone else could be ripping off your content, selling it to the unsuspecting, and making it that much harder for you to find the instances of copyright violation (which it still IS). GREAT.\nIts an occupational hazard this copying menace, and the sooner a solution is found to eradicate it, the better.\nWow, never thought about it. There are many languages and many letters which could be mixed this way.\nWow. This is really shady! Thank you for posting it.\nAwesome, Greg! I have update the article to include your plugin!\nYou should add that you can\u2019t copy and paste it into google because then you\u2019re pasting the foreign characters. To check if its original, manually type 5-6 of the words all in quotations for the exact phrase search. Chances are, it won\u2019t be original (at least the sources it was created from) but if it\u2019s intended for SEO as well, that\u2019s not even the issue. The bigger issue is it\u2019s probably going to have negative value to google because to a computer (or word processor), it\u2019s a mashup of nonsense characters from different languages with contain no real keywords or even words at all.\nAnd yes I just got scammed by this on a Fiverr gig. Going to see what can be done about it.\nThank you Ann for providing the details of content writing scams that occur on sites like Fiverr. I myself was scammed once. Thanks again for creating awareness of these unethical practices.\nThanks for saving me from. a massive disaster which is coming. I am getting lots of guest post request and I think most of the guest post writer is following this is scam way to generate more article. Thanks again for giving solutions by which I can solve the alien coding issue."
