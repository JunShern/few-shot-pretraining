    "text": "Happy Saturday! It was completely unintentional but this week\u2019s work outfits were all black and white.\nI wore this heart print dress to work the other day. It has a shorter length so I wore black tights and oxfords to make it look more work appropriate.\nThe 22cm bag measurements are as follows: 2.5\u2033 width, 5.25\u2033 height, 7.5\u2033 top length, 8.5\u2033 bottom length, and 44\u2033 max strap length (approximately 22\u2033 drop length).\nI lined dried the above Ann Taylor sweater and washed it on cold but I found that the material (76% viscose, 24% nylon) shrinks a bit when you wash it. I always line dry my tops but the sweater fit snug after laundering. I had to steam it out after it was dry in order to loosen the fibers and get it close to the original fit.\nMy exact skirt is old but I noticed that a similar style is back at LOFT Outlet in a houndstooth print!\nGet 40% off your purchase at LOFT if you use your LOVELOFT or Ann Taylor credit card.

Purchases must be made with an LOVELOFT or Ann Taylor credit card.\nHere are some LOFT new arrivals I\u2019ve been eyeing.\nNew early access styles (these styles are not yet in stores) are also online at LOFT Outlet.\nI spotted a new section on the LOFT site on Tuesday for \u2018back in stock\u2018 items. This popular turtleneck poncho sweater (last featured here, review here and here) from the fall is back in regular missy sizes! I took my usual size XXS regular. Update 1/28: It\u2019s also back in a speckled version here!\nIf you missed out on the white version of this lace dot peplum blouse from last year (refer to last year\u2019s review of size XXS regular and XXSP here and size XS regular here) I noticed that it\u2019s back in stock in the missy sizes at LOFT Outlet.\nI noticed that this popular cozy cowl neck sweater from last year (old review here) is back at LOFT Outlet and this version doesn\u2019t contain wool.\nThis popular sweater vest from 2016 and 2017 is back in regular and petite sizes at LOFT Outlet (old review here).\nFor size reference I\u2019m 5\u2032 2.5\u2033, I weigh 108-110 pounds and I\u2019m usually size XS petite in tops and 0/25 petite in pants and jeans if an item runs true to LOFT sizing. If you\u2019re new to my blog I typically share the link to a short video clip below each image (the same video clips I share in my Instagram stories swipe ups). My reviews and outfits are also Pinterest for those of you that prefer a more organized, visual catalog. Check out my other reviews organized by retailer here.\nThis heart print dress has a generous fit so I made it work by pairing a more substantial cardigan with some structure over it. My usual size is roomy all over if you view the clip here. The dress is also very short measuring 32.25\u2033 total length (the missy sizes should be at least 1\u2033 longer if not more). The other measurements of size XSP are as follows: 14.25\u2033 shoulders, 22.25\u2033 sleeve length, 34.5\u2033 bust (measured pit to pit) and 40.5\u2033 where the flounce hem begins.\nI thought this neutral sweater was cute over the dress. I would probably need to size up in the sweater for a looser fit at the hips so that it allows the bottom of the dress more room to flow. I\u2019ll have to try on my other sweaters on over the dress to see if any others would work. However, my favorite wait to wear the dress is to pair it with the black cardigan I showed in the first look.\nI\u2019ve been wanting to try this plaid blouse for a while and I finally remember to order it to try. I\u2019ve tried on other split neck blouses before and I\u2019ve always had to size down since I have a smaller chest. The material is thinner and it\u2019s the same material as this plaid ruffle collar utility blouse I reviewed here. Size XXSP fits like size XSP so I found it to fit one size bigger and would recommend sizing down. The top is still a bit loose (the v-neck moves around and I can see a slight peek of my bra) all over on me so I returned it but I really love the size of the plaid print.\nSpeaking of split neck blouses, I bought this keyhole bell cuff blouse (review here) in size XSP last year and I really wish I had gone down to size XXSP for a better fit.\nI thought this pink swiss dot blouse was so cute but it has a very flowy/boxy fit. I am usually size XSP but I went down to size XXSP which measures: 34.5\u2033 bust (pit to pit), 36\u2033 at the start of the piping at the top of the peplum flounce, 19\u2033 sleeve length and 14\u2033 shoulders. I did not love how this year\u2019s version fits me at the chest so I returned it.\nYou can see the side by side comparison of this new blouse and the older one from last year here and here. Based on my comparison I would saw this year\u2019s version fits at least one size bigger than last year\u2019s version.\nI was curious about this sweater but I didn\u2019t love this blue color on me. I\u2019ll have to try it in the grey color another time. It fits true to size for a relaxed fit and the material isn\u2019t itchy since it doesn\u2019t contain wool. Update 1/13: I tried on the grey color in a size XS and the oversized fit from sizing up is a really cute look.\nI also ordered this heart zip mirror compact but I was disappointed with the mirror inside since it isn\u2019t very clear. Looking at the little mirror was actually disorienting, the outside was a bit bumpy due to how they put it together and the zipper wasn\u2019t very smooth for the one I received. It was a cute compact but the execution was lacking.\nIf you caught my previous post I have some more items to review so I\u2019ll be back with more. I also plan to stop by the stores tomorrow so I\u2019ll see if anything else catches my eye.\nThanks so much, Young. You always leave the sweetest comments on my blog!"
