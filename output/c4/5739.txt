Love the penguin series, but this one takes you to a new level of fun. I didn't have very high hopes as most leave me disappointed, but surprised in a pleasant way. If you love these types of puzzles, this is a must.\nRated 5 out of 5 by Limey2 from Worlds greatest places mosaics 2. I believe this is the first time I have ever given 2 reviews in 1 day - never mind 2 good reviews - for mosaics style games. Out of sheer boredom I have tried 2 new games, both being mosaics style. They actually both have something new, this one having different shaped tiles. It gives you something else to think about other than just colours. You have to take a bit more care and think a bit more about what you are doing. I just wish the demos were a bit more than one hour. It is over all too quickly. This is a definite buy for me.\nRated 5 out of 5 by grandmacathy from Who knew you could create different griddlers? I love these griddler games! I do the trial for every one that I see on Big Fish. I always enjoy them, some more than others but generally they are all fun. This game, though, takes griddlers to another level and beyond. It was fun when the different colors came out. Each new game had more colors. I loved it. This game not only has 4 colors to some levels, it has two other new twists to the game - swap and shapes. i'll admit - it took me a while to catch on to the shapes one. Especially when there are multiple colors involved too! I really had to pay attention to what I was looking for - a red square or a red circle or a red hexagon. I had to play that first level a few times before I caught on. Once I did, I was hooked. Bravo!\nRated 5 out of 5 by dachsy from Another Winner With Clever Innovations! Pennmom36 has done a great job of reviewing this game, so there is little to add. The innovations presented are well thought out and work well. It will take you a while to get used to the these new formats, but persevere and I think you will be pleasantly surprised. Both of the two new variations require patience and care, if you are to get the 3 stars for them. You cannot make a mistake in these to obtain the three stars. In the demo, the five puzzles I got through were done completely with logic. For these new variations to succeed, logic would have to be certain, so I am cautiously optimistic that the logic will continue. If so, this will set a new standard in this genre, making the penguin look quite mundane in comparison.\nRated 5 out of 5 by gg3000 from One of the BEST games I've played this year! I am a big fan of the mosaic/griddler/fill in puzzles and have been playing them since I found the pencil and paper version decades ago. So it is with great pleasure I can recommend this latest version of the game done by \"World's Greatest Mosaics 2.\" This particular game has so many awesome twists to the usual fill in method that I was delighted every time I started a new level. As another reviewer mentioned, I don't want to spoil things by revealing too much, and besides, some of the mechanics just need to be played to be believed, but the puzzles are challenging and the colors are bright. I WILL recommend playing at the casual level until you see what's what and replay later for the time challenge.\nRated 5 out of 5 by sunnyglow from EXPLORE A WHOLE NEW WORLD - ONE FILLLED WITH DIVERSITY OF PUZZLES IN DIFFERENT COLORS AND SHAPES OVERVIEW: A BIG THANK YOU TO BFG! What a wonderful Monday surprise! Travel the world with a rich diversity of mosaic puzzles differing in colors and shapes. This developer is now the one to beat in the creation of these games. I LOVE this type of game and this one is well-crafted \u2013 truly exquisite! As you play each puzzle, you will add to your wisdom about the world. Every puzzle contains a small blurb about some aspect of the country you are visiting. Each level contains fifteen (15) puzzles which can be modified for your enjoyment. Customize this game to your preference! This game provides some special features not available from other developers in this game genre. There are up to six colors used within the puzzle. There are also puzzles featuring different shapes and some allow you to switch the tiles as well. There are three levels of play with the ability to customize the game. The colors are vivid and the completed pictures are recognizable and well-defined. There is an ample supply of puzzles in all levels of difficulty. The grids vary as well. This is a quality game which is a must have for all lovers of this type of puzzle. It is a steal at the listed price! HOW TO PLAY: This is variety of a Sudoku puzzle. In this puzzle, create pictures by filling in squares in a grid. The grids in this game will vary in size. Each side of the grid will have numbers for each line of squares indicating the number of squares which are to be filled in for that row of squares. Squares are filled in where the squares intersect between the two sets of numbers on each side. GAME FACTS: \u2022 Levels: Casual, Normal, Expert, and Custom. \u2022 In the customized version you can choose between 30 to 120 seconds for the hint bar to refill and you can choose between 1 to 5 errors before you must restart the puzzles. \u2022 Choice between whether you cross off the numbers listed at the top and on the sides - either one-by-one or when a row is complete. \u2022 Colors: The game has up to six colored screens which can be switched at any time while playing the puzzle. \u2022 Puzzles vary by colors and shapes. There are puzzles which allow you to swap tiles. \u2022 Autofill: The computer will automatically fill in unused squares with X\u2019s. \u2022 You get up to three stars per puzzle if you meet the requirements by finishing it without errors and within a specific time. I highly recommend this game if you like Sudoku games or any type of mathematical puzzle.\nRated 5 out of 5 by lamp_post from FINALLY! IT IS HERE I have been waiting for this game to come out for quite sometime and I am not disappointed. The colors are vibrant and it is a little different from the first game in this series. Once you try it you will see what I mean. I do not like to give too much away in my reviews, as I like to be surprised when playing games and not have the entire game laid out for me. The music is relaxing and the Mosaics are beautiful. I am one Happy Camper! This is a buy. Please try this game if you are into Griddlers, Mosaics or whatever you want to call them. It is a fun filled game.\nRated 5 out of 5 by pennmom36 from I FELL IN LOVE WITH THE \"SHAPES\" TYPE MOSAICS IMMEDIATELY! World's Greatest Places Mosaics has done it again! These guys really know how to think outside the box, to come up with some of the most unusual variations of Mosaic puzzles. I fell in love with the \"Shapes\" type Mosaic puzzle almost instantly. It would be really cool if you could opt to solve all of the mosaics with the type of your choice, instead of having to do the puzzles in whichever type they come in. Once again, you can choose the difficulty of the puzzles from several options. Casual mode has no timer, numbers are crossed off one by one and the hint timer recharges quickly. Normal mode has a timer with plenty of time, numbers are still crossed off one by one, and the hint recharges slowly. Expert mode gives you limited time to complete each level, numbers are crossed off only when an entire row has been completed, and the hint recharges very slowly. However, there's also a Custom mode setting that allows you to choose whether or not you want a timer, how long the hint takes to recharge from 30-120 seconds, how many mistakes you are allowed from 1-5, whether you want the numbers crossed off one by one or when an entire row is completed, and whether you want a time bonus. Not only do you get to create beautiful and colorful pictures, but you get to create pictures with depth. There are the original one color grids, as well as the newer three color type grids where you change the colors by clicking on the color bubble. This feature helps you solve the puzzles when you get stumped, because you can switch between colors to narrow down the field. The Swap type Mosaics is a very challenging variation, each puzzle starts out with several different colored cells filled in, and you must swap the tiles to complete the puzzle. If a colored tile is in the correct cell, you won't be able to swap it, which is a good thing, otherwise this type could drive you insane! The final type was my absolute favorite, The Shapes type Mosaic. You will not only have the multi-colored bubbles to choose from, but you will also have a multi-shape button to toggle between. The numbers located on each column and row will indicate the shape, for instance, there might be a number 5 that has a circle around the number, indicating that you must switch to the circle shape button, or it may have a square or a hexagon shape around the number. This feature adds just the right amount of challenge to make it really interesting, at least for me personally, I wish all of the puzzles were offered in this style! The coolest part about Mosaics offered by this developer, is that you can choose the order you want to play the grids, in each level, if you want to play all of the swap types first, you can, in fact, you can play the mosaics in any order you want! World's Greatest Places Mosaics, also gives you some interesting facts and pictures of different places around the world. I really like how they are able to add new twists to an age old standard. Give this one a try, I'm eager to see what's in store for me with the other Mosaic game offered today. This is a great Mosaic griddler day, enjoy!\nRated 3 out of 5 by gagoogle from Hard on the eyes and sensibilities The shaped clues were hard to decipher--I kept mixing up the circles and hexagons. Also, the dialog accompanying the levels regarding the \"great places\" was full of misinformation, poor spelling and bad grammar.\nRated 3 out of 5 by verimeri from from excellent to mediocre I very much enjoyed the levels with shapes. I wish this developer would create a game that only has shape mosaics. The three color level and the one color levels are so last year, or it is the year before that or even before that? Swap is mostly just boring. So out of every 15 levels you get three shape games. Got to suffer through 12 boring games. No way to skip them, I tried. I can't really recommend this game. Three good games out of every fifteen is not worth spending your money on.\nTake a trip around the world and solve over 100 colorful mosaics puzzles!"
