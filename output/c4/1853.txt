    "text": "Fix: \"This Project location not fully trusted by .NET Framework...\"\nUsing the Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1 Configuration administrative tool, you need to add a code group with a path to the network share and give it full trust.\nIf you know you are going to have zeros appear in the denominator of formulas in a stored procedure or function, use the nullif function to null them out, e.g. nullif(@MyValue, 0).\nThe test is a complex test with a simple result (a happy smiley face...as opposed to a sad smiley face) if your browser meets all the standards.\nThe complexity involved in creating a full-blown SOA where everything is a service seems to me to more often than not outweigh whatever the benefits of separation of logic is supposed to be in terms of code reuse (and I'm a heretic on that whole issue anyway...one should remove business logic from your data layer, but only if it makes sense).\nStep 1: Setup a system DSN. In this case, we will be using a database file. I named the DSN VFPDBC, and set it to a dbc file called TestDatabase.dbc which contained a table called TestContainedTable. Create DSN using the Microsoft VFP Driver for .dbf files (there are different drivers listed in the available dropdown).\nStep 2: Create the Linked Server in SQL Server Enterprise Manager using the Microsoft OLE DB Provider for ODBC Drivers. In this case, I named the Linked Server VFPDBC.\nT-SQL: \"exceeds the maximum number of bytes per row (8060)\"\nThis message occurs when the sum of the bytes of the data types of all the columns in a table exceeds the limit that SQL Server allows. The only real solution for this is to break up the table into multiple tables.\nThis method allows you to set filter and sorting criteria and pull all rows that meet them from a DataTable. However, if you have a large number of rows, the performance nose-dives dramatically.\nFor instance, with a data table of about 400,000 rows, to do a certain number of iterations of a method that used DataTable.Select took approximately 20 minutes. By ordering the data and doing some checks on each row within a for loop to make sure it met the criteria I needed, the same number of iterations took less than 1 second.\nSo, be careful when using DataTable.Select (and make sure you index it, etc. regardless). If you have a large number of rows, you might find that writing more code (which, depending on your view of for loops, may look messy) performs significantly better.\nDoes the table contain a column uniquely identifying the row?\nBe careful of performance, add few indexes.\nBe careful of the indexes disk usage. Index all fields used in where or sort clauses.\nDo most queries sort on a particular field?\nIndex this field! Sort the index the way your sorts expect the data.\nDo most queries filter on a particular field?\nIndex this field! If the query selects a few columns, create a composite index and add the selected fields to the index.\nDoes the table contain mainly natural language text?\nThis error will occur if you are trying to use NTLM authorization on a web site, and the users are hitting it from behind a proxy server. There is no 'fix' for this. The web site will need to be reconfigured to use basic or digest authentication.\nThis is related to XP. As with XP, I don't know all of the details, so I can't really judge this (though I am initially skeptical), but there's a lot of info here.\nOtherwise, if ansi_warnings is on, it will still report errors and terminate batches, regardless of the setting of arithabort. Also, arithabort overrides arithignore.\nThere's a lot in here for those that deal with SOA to think about."
