The objective of the club is to provide a community of folks who appreciate birds and each other.\nPhoto by Birdwatching Club member Mark Gieger.\nIt has been advertised in the past to freshmen as a very low-commitment club with the one annual meeting not even a requirement. They have two or three larger events that they plan each school year in relation to birding.\nTheir current goals, besides campus birdfeeders, are to get bird books and a couple sets of binoculars for community use.\nPhoto by Birdwatching Club member Corey Stockman.\n\u201cAnother big goal that we have is just to make birding more accessible to the typical BSU student,\u201d says Brey.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if a student has any experience with birds or bird watching; all skill levels are welcomed in BWC. For more information about the club, check out their page on Beaverlink and their page on Facebook.\nGet Ready to Laugh, Bemidji!"
