    "text": "Mercury Records and UMe have gone beyond the call of duty and created a MASSIVE Kiss vinyl box set to celebrate the band\u2019s 40th Anniversary. Kissteria \u2013 The Ultimate Vinyl Road Case will contain 34 vinyl LPs alongside a plethora of memorabilia items.\nThe vinyl LPs include 19 studio albums, five Alive releases and six exclusive pressings for this box: Double Platinum, Greatest KISS, KILLERS, You Wanted The Best, You Got The Best, Smashes, Thrashes & Hits and KISS Symphony: Alive IV.\nAll the vinyl packaging will replicate the originals with (where applicable) special features like embossing, sticker sheets, posters, and lenticular covers.\nAdditional bonus items include twelve large (11\u201dx17\u201d) posters, KISS vinyl cleaning cloth, KISS turntable mat, KISS dominoes set, four band lithos and a numbered certificate of authenticity.\nThis set is newly remastered and weighs in at almost 50 pounds. It will be shipped in two batches: the Road Case loaded with some of the LPs and the KISS-related merchandise goes out at the end of June and the rest of the LPs, including the ones exclusive to the box, will be send out at the beginning of August.\nThis ludicrously excessive set has a price to match \u2013 $1750!\nCustom ANVIL\u00ae Road Case to house 34 KISS LPs and a plethora of extras.\nSonic Boom missing for a reason?\ntext. Vets name these peripheral (outside the brain), or central (inside the brain) vestibular illness.\nillness. Try not panic over your dog\u2019s vestibulitis.\nI do believe all of the concepts you have offered in your post.\nThey\u2019re very convincing and will certainly work. Still, the posts are very quick for starters.\nsite lots of times pprevious to I could get it to load properly.\nMmmmm Jethro Tull conkers. Where do I sign up?..!\nWow\u2013I count myself as one of their fans and even I think this is a ripoff.\nThey put on a great show, but does the quality of their recorded material justify this over-the-top, super-expensive box set? I\u2019ll pass.\nFirst we had marbles now we have dominoes. What\u2019s next, a Jethro Tull vinyl discography box that features artwork themed conkers?\nThere is evidently a label-wide bet going on as to who can produce the most over-priced box set that features a band themed traditional game for no apparent reason.\nThey should start thinking inside the box rather than outside it at their meetings and then fans won\u2019t be so bemused when they see what extras they are paying for.\nKISS doesn\u2019t ever do anything small.\nDoes look nice! Hopefully the folks who put this project together also focused on quality vinyl as well as sound.\nI think the exclusive editions are the titles that haven\u2019t been re-pressed as part of the new individual Kiss remasters that are due for release soon.\nDisappointed that with all that cost, they couldn\u2019t stretch to including a complete discography; most obvously they\u2019re missing Sonic Boom, and to a lesser extent the Kiss Klassics/Jigoku-Retsuden album of re-recorded material by the current lineup, and the remixed Destroyer Resurrected.\nwhy.. ? because its KISS !\ni am not sure i follow the \u201cexclusive\u201d part of some of the pressings, as i have the vinyl of Smashes, Thrashes & Hits, as i suspect many do.\ndoes this simply mean that the non-exclusives either are or have been reissued on their own anyway?\nand wasn\u2019t there a PC game of PsychoCircus?"
