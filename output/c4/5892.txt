The Gramcrackers Mitts by Alyssa Copp in Wool of the Andes Tweed make the perfect accessory! Rustic tweedy nepps really shine in this simple pattern. Shown here in Rabbit Heather, I think they would look incredibly stunning in a dark color like Wellies Heather (on sale for $3.14/50g ball). I've knit three sweaters in this incredibly rugged-yet-soft yarn and have become a total super fan-girl for Wellies Heather.\nThis month, our most colorful yarn, Chroma, is now on sale for 20% off! To say we love Chroma is an understatement...you could say we're obsessed and that would be fine with us.
