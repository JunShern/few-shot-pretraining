    "text": "Before SAP Labs designed its new digs in Palo Alto, company executives asked employees how to make it a welcoming place to work. After all, that\u2019s where they spend most of their day.\nThe answer? Windows. Lots of windows letting in lots of light.\nThe German-based business software company complied \u2013 even going so far as to move executives away from windows to give more workers access to daylight.\nAs the country embraces \u201cgreen\u201d building design \u2013 be it in the workplace or at home \u2013 daylight has become a premium. Not only does it save energy \u2013 more sunlight means less bulb light \u2013 but research shows that workers with access to natural light are more productive.\n\u201cYour mind is pretty powerful. If you feel more connected naturally, you perform better,\u201d said Alan Turner, principal of the Mountain View architectural firm Hawley, Peterson and Snyder, which designed the Hewlett Foundation\u2019s Menlo Park headquarters, one of California\u2019s first buildings to earn a gold rating from the U.S. Green Building Council.\nPerhaps, but recent studies supporting the productivity claim are helping architects convince developers that such green features are good for business \u2013 everybody\u2019s business. Not only can landlords charge more for the space, but companies can achieve better results from their employees.\nLisa Heschong, founder of Heschong Mahone Group in Sacramento, has spent years studying the connection between people and sunlight. In 2003, Heschong studied workers in a Sacramento Municipal Utility District call center to discover whether natural light plus a view made any difference.\nBased on a 1999 analysis she performed with shoppers and schoolchildren, she already knew that natural light caused shoppers to buy more and students to perform better in school. But in the study requested by the California Energy Commission, she wanted to analyze worker productivity and whether it mattered if people had a view.\n\u201cWe found really, really big effects,\u201d said Heschong, who studied two call centers operating 12 hours a day with 100 employees. In each study, employees with views outside their windows answered and processed calls 7 percent faster than employees doing the same work without a view.\nNo one is exactly sure why people perform better with a view, but Heschong has a theory. It has to do with circadian rhythms, the 24-hour cycle in the physiological processes of living beings.\nWhile the data was compelling, when it was released four years ago there was little if any construction under way in the U.S. commercial real estate market, and Silicon Valley was experiencing one of its worst downturns in history. Now that the construction pipeline is bulging with commercial projects, the research is beginning to resonate with companies planning new buildings, as well as the developers in charge of building them.\nIn fact, after years of watching developers\u2019 eyes glaze over when he mentioned environmentally friendly design, David Hobstetter, principal at KMD Architects in San Francisco, has seen a change.\nOne developer who\u2019s already on board is Jay Paul Co. of San Francisco, currently building Silicon Valley\u2019s largest development in five years, the 1.8-million-square-foot Moffett Towers. Matt Lituchy, chief investment officer for Jay Paul, said bona fide research linking light with worker productivity helps make the case for designing buildings with more natural lighting.\nThe seven-building, eight-story Moffett Towers offer what Lituchy called a \u201ccurtain wall\u201d of floor-to-ceiling windows, with floors that measure 38,000 square feet, allowing more light to reach the buildings\u2019 interior. In comparison, much of the valley\u2019s older building stock has floors that are two and three times as large, and not much if any light reaches inside. None of the Moffett Towers buildings has leased yet, but Lituchy said the interest is high.\nTo critics who say such construction costs too much, architects counter that green design is no longer more expensive than standard design because more suppliers have entered the marketplace, bringing down prices.\nCompanies have also discovered that offices designed to make workers more comfortable pay for themselves. Standard industry norms say that during a building\u2019s 30-year life cycle, a company will spend 90 percent of the costs on salaries for its workers; 3 percent on energy for lighting, heating and cooling; 4 percent on operating the building; and 3 percent on constructing the building.\n\u201cIf we can achieve a minor improvement in productivity \u2013 and good daylighting has demonstrated that you can get 7, 8 or 10 percent improvements in performance \u2013 you pay for the bricks and mortar,\u201d said Hobstetter, whose firm is designing the San Francisco headquarters for the Public Utilities Commission, touted to be the greenest building in the country.\nRoney said that bolstered with the research, he has little trouble convincing the bosses to give up the corner office with a view so more people can enjoy it. Especially in Silicon Valley, where companies lure workers with such features as chef-prepared meals, massages and dry cleaning service, it stands to reason that offices with views would not be a tough sell.\n\u201cAll companies are realizing that their most important asset is their people,\u201d Roney said."
