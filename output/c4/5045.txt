Positive change is not usually easy, but it is definitely worth it in the long run!\nDr Damon Ashworth is a Clinical Psychologist who specialises in treating sleep disorders. This is primarily Chronic Insomnia, but he also assists people with Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorders (advance or delayed sleep phase disorder), Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Restless Legs Syndrome, Periodic Limb Movement Disorder, Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Parasomnias including sleep talking, sleepwalking, nighttime hallucinations, nightmares and night terrors.\nDr Ashworth completed a Doctoral degree in Clinical Psychology at Monash University and a Bachelor of Behavioural Sciences and a Bachelor of Psychological Science with Honours at La Trobe University.\nHis Doctoral research was a randomised clinical trial that significantly reduced insomnia and depression severity of participants across only four sessions of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I).\nThese promising findings were published in the Journal of Counselling Psychology and were the first in the world to show that CBT-I can significantly improve both mood and sleep in individuals who have previously failed to progress through antidepressant treatment.\nDr Ashworth applies all of the knowledge that he has learnt throughout his research, studies and personal experiences to help clients who seek a greater understanding of their difficulties as well as strategies to improve their psychological health and well-being.\nDr Ashworth has a specific interest in Health Psychology and has worked with Caulfield Rehabilitation Hospital and Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in helping people adjust to and cope with severe and chronic physical conditions.\nHe is also interested in trauma-focused Psychology and has experience in treating trauma-based symptoms in war-veterans and other individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\nDr Ashworth takes a client-centred approach to treatment and aims to reduce distress and improve well-being in clients while helping them to achieve their goals.\nHe practices mostly from a Cognitive Behavioural Therapy or an Acceptance and Commitment Therapy framework, but also utilise Existential, Psychodynamic, Interpersonal, Humanistic, and Positive Psychology principles where clients will benefit from such approaches.\nDr Ashworth is passionate about the field of Psychology and always aims to apply the latest empirical findings to best help individuals meet their psychological and emotional needs.\nDr Ashworth is currently volunteering as a Mental Health Specialist with the Vanuatu Ministry of Health in Port Vila, Vanuatu. He is assisting the Mind Care Unit at the Port Vila Central Hospital. He is volunteering under the Australian Volunteer Program, which is sponsored by the Australian Government.\nThanks for taking an interest in my blog.
