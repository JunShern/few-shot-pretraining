    "text": "I hope everyone's had a good week! Are you ready to share your accomplishments for the week? Even if it's small, we want to hear about it! So grab your camera, write a quick post, and show off a little!\nToday I want to share a special quilt with you, made for a special friend. Cindy, a friend of mine at church and member of the quilt ministry, gave up her days off over four months to go with me to my chemo treatments. Together we worked on binding ministry quilts while talking to the other people there receiving their chemo treatments. She turned what could have been at the very least a boring time, and at the worst a frightening and unpleasant one, into a pleasurable few hours spent in the company of friends. So I wanted to make a quilt for her to thank her for taking those hours that she could have used for much more pleasant purposes and spending them with me!\nYou may remember the Charlie Brown quilt I made a few weeks ago - this quilt is made by the same design. There is a tutorial by AmandaJean (aka Crazy Quilt Mom) that you can see here. It's super simple and easily adaptable for different sizes. This one is made with 30 WOF strips in prints (3 of each print makes one row) and 30 WOF strips in the background solid. It makes this quilt approximately 60\" square, and even leaves a few blocks for the back of the quilt.\nThe fabrics in this quilt are some of the Denise Schmidt prints from Joann Fabrics and Kona White. The binding is a Michael Miller print, I think called Confetti. The colors blended very nicely with the Denise Schmidt prints, with a tiny pop of purple for spice!\nI really had fun quilting this one - using the Juki on the quilting frame, I did strings of curlicues in each band of zig zags. It kind of reminds me of a string of Christmas lights!\nI like the way it looks on the back, too. It wasn't very hard to do, unless I started thinking about which direction the loop had to go, then I almost always messed it up!\nAnd here's the back in all it's glory - simple but pretty! Thanks for letting me share this special quilt with you!!\nLink up and share your accomplishments!\nPS - Remember that I'm going to have a really great giveaway when the followers counter hits 500 - only 6 more to go!! My adorable husband bought one item on my Christmas wish list twice, and suggested that I use the duplicate for a giveaway - and it's a really great item! So spread the word and be sure to join in when that number rolls up!!\nWhat a special person Cindy is-friends like her are precious and rare.\nLove the quilt you made for her and the quilting is wonderful.
