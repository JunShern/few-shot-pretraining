    "text": "Gully Boy is one of the most awaited movies of this year which hits the theatres today. The movie starring Ranveer Singh and Alia Bhatt in lead roles has already won critical acclaim internationally and is all set to take over the country with the music and power packed performances. Amid this, we got in touch with Bollywood\u2019s go-to celebrity hairstylist Avan Contractor, who is the person behind Ranveer's hairdo in the movie. Avan decoded Ranveer aka Murad's look who plays an underdog from the slums of Dharavi with a boyish charm who dream of becoming stars.\nAbout what inspired Ranveer's look for the movie, Avan explained, \"Young rappers from Dharavi. We actually went and met the real rappers who the film is inspired by. We watched them and literally studied their style. Though they take most of their style inspiration from international rappers, there are hints of their roots in their style as they come from simple backgrounds.\" She further elaborated that the description given to them for the look was that it must be \"Hassle free, disheveled, textured hair with easy movement.\" Well, Ranveer surely does look the part and how!\nMeanwhile, Gully Boy, also starring Siddhant Chaturvedi in pivotal role, has been inspired from the lives of real life gully boys, Divine and Naezy. Ranveer and Alia have been going all out with promotions and looks like the duo is here for a win. According to trade analyst, the movie is set for a big opening at the box office."
