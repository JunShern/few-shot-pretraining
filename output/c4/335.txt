    "text": "ABOUT US Over the past 15 years project design work has taken Polis Group beyond New Zealand to exotic places like Qatar, Malaysia, China, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Turkey, India and South Africa. Landscape planning of large tracts of land, architectural design within the public realm, and the design of urban areas have all featured in our portfolio. Our involvement with projects in the Middle East has allowed us to provide design solutions that incorporate indigenous and sustainable qualities in both building and landscape projects, as well as providing modern solutions in rapidly developing locations.\nshared design goal through collaboration. This blending of knowledge and expertise in allied disciplines invariably leads to the adoption of well-grounded design principles, ultimately reflected in a harmonious and successful end product. Our company is often faced with optimising the benefits of development for our clients, while still maintaining a wider stewardship of environmental features and values. As facilitators of land planning and design, we are well placed to create places that have meaning, function and a sensitivity for environmental and social purposes. The end result of our work is about creating inspirational places and communities.\nThom is a director of Christchurch based architectural firm Thom Craig Architects LTD (TCA Ltd) with 35 years of experience in New Zealand, South Africa, England, Asia and Middle East.

The design embraces an abstraction of nature using local materials, colours and vegetation. Elements include the design of streams, pools, planting, shade structures, rock work and bridges.\nAL BAYT STADIUM QATAR The Al Bayt Stadium in Qatar will become a centre piece for the 2022 Football World Cup. The stadium landscape will impact a powerful message. The design inspiration is based on an abstraction of the Arabian desert with the plaza being located on the high plateau with wadis running off the plateau as waterfalls which form oases and give life to plants. A sadu pattern within the paving creates a local identity which complements the stadium\u00e2&#x20AC;&#x2122;s indigenous pattern. Our seamless approach to this project integrates the disciplines of landscape, architecture, lighting, irrigation and engineering into a comprehensive and coherent whole. The project was undertaken in conjunction with QDC Engineers, who managed the design process.\nThe various designs for the restaurants, kiosks and activity nodes enhance the spirit of this place beyond the focus of the 2022 World Cup. As with the design of the main stadium building, these various ancillary structures maximise the functional use of their varied enclosures with the use of macro and micro scaled outcomes that includes the use of master planning, materials, structural solutions, and interior \u2018drama\u2019. That delivers a flexible design that supports the intended design use.\nNote: Concept plan only. Areas are approximate and subject to final scheme plan & survey.\nK ATARA PARK QATAR As part of the competition, the design for this 50ha parkland in Doha, Qatar has been strongly influenced by nature itself. It will be a parkland of topographical features, a stream with ponds and falls; trees and shrubland; and a complexity of small spaces with paths to encourage adventure. The design proposes a rich image of shade and shelter, of recessively placed buildings in a modernised and naturalised community for the introduction of bird life. It will symbolise a retreat from the world to a cool oasis which will foster harmony and enjoyment. The naturalistic forms celebrate the sound and sight of water, emphasises the spirit of harmony in nature.\nGRAND HERITAGE HOTEL QATAR The early 18th Century English garden served as the principal design influence for the design of the Aspire Hotel in Doha, Qatar. The design is structured by water and path axes with parterres, pools and foundations, follies, a band rotunda, boat house, a maze, pergolas, copses of trees and undulating land forms. The project was undertaken in conjunction with QDC.\nK ATARA MALL DOHA, QATAR Located near to the Doha seafront, this is a high quality mall with retail shops and fine dining restaurants for locals and tourists to enjoy. Our role was to assist QDC with the entrances, car parking and landscape design throughout and give a sense of grandeur.\nAL EMADI VILLAGE DOHA, QATAR CGLA played a key role in the masterplanning and design of the streetscape and open space in this urban development in Doha. A large outdoor space for fine dining, promenading and socialisation. Classical elegance portrayed with landscape components of bridges, pergolas, plants lighting and water. An outdoor cooling system will allow for usage during hot conditions.\nDOHA SK ATE PARK QATAR Polis Group has recently delivered a design for Doha\u00e2&#x20AC;&#x2122;s primary public skate park, set into a newly developed part of the Corniche area.

Spaces surrounding the stadium will provide green oases with canopy trees, enclosed courtyards for shade and relaxation. Use of water draws a connection towards the ocean and the seafront where recreation, play and delight are fused together to create a vibrant, exciting public space.\nDOHA CORNICHE QATAR Polis Group has recently undertaken conceptual work for an extention to the Corniche in Doha. The work focuses on access and seafront improvements along a 3km stretch of the Doha coast, which connects the Doha Port World Cup Stadium to the existing corniche. The design incorporates several nodes of activity which include public spaces and facilities including shade, play, kiosks, cafes, fan zones, an ecological reserve area, boardwalks, and use of existing features such as jettys and pontoons.\nMT COOK NATIONAL PARK NEW ZEALAND The design at Mount Cook Village has created a distinct and attractive area with a sense of arrival for visitation. Connections and linkages are established with the surrounding facilities through roading and pathways. The use of local materials and colour schemes integrates the design into the environment. For housing units, an indigenous alpine landscape has been created with the mounded periphery. The use of boulders, woodsets, bridge beams and alpine shrubs as landscape features help to relate the place to its context.\nCAIRO HOUSING EGYPT The Kasbah includes the design of Egyptian vernacular architecture in a modern idiom incorporating gardens, shade and water with different styles and densities of housing.\nALMARAI BOTTLING PLANT SAUDI ARABIA This proposed development to the NW of Riyadh for a fresh water bottling plant is based around a central shaded forecourt and water feature.
