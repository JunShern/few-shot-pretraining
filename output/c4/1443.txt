    "text": "Home \u00bb News \u00bb Facebook secretly sharing your data to Apple, Amazon and Microsoft?\nFacebook, perhaps the most popular social media internet site, is again under the red eye of customers for purportedly dripping their information to companies such as Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, as well as Yahoo. The record came from New York Times and stated that Facebook has been sharing data like usernames, contact details, usernames of good friends, likes, etc. without the approval of the customer.\nVisitors may be asking yourself why Facebook would do this without any advantage. However the fact is that Facebook is profiting mostly from it. They would have a lot more website traffic on their site, their customer base would raise and also the advertisements they get from their marketers would also expand in number. All this suggests an increase in revenue for Facebook. They might even market the information for financial returns from 3rd parties.\nThis is not the first time Facebook has actually been accused of selling its users\u2019 data to 3rd parties. In April, the CEO of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg needed to encounter the Congressional hearing relating to numerous claims made by studies as well as studies on Facebook. Nonetheless, Mark rejected the claims entirely, saying \u201cWe do not market information to any individual\u201d. Whether that holds true, users, regulators, as well as media have actually taken it out on Facebook concerning privacy violations.\nAltogether, Facebook has actually turned into one of the biggest marketplaces for data on the web and the users do not also find out about it. Breaking out social media accounts, online search engine and also applications are simply \u2018information losses in disguise\u2019. All of the data that these web sites, applications, and systems accumulate are being utilized to set a target audience and also obtain advertisements.\nIn April, the CEO of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg had to face the Legislative hearing concerning several claims made by researches and surveys on Facebook. Whether or not that is true, users, regulatory authorities, and also media have taken it out on Facebook pertaining to personal privacy breaches.\nCompletely, Facebook has actually ended up being one of the largest industries for information on the internet and the customers do not also recognize concerning it."
