An approachable, friendly person, good with numbers and anticipating and solving the issues faced by the students with an extensive experience in tutoring. I'm good at teaching the basic concepts and build the foundation of the subject for the student. I have an interactive way of teaching in which the student contributes and positively reinforces his understanding.\nIts been approximately 2 years that I have been teaching Economics. Most of the students get confused between the concepts and after teaching so many students, I now know the precise places where the students tend to get confused at.\nThe block booking of 10 lessons is available with a 10% discount.\nI've completed my MBA Finance with a distinction. I have studied Finance in my undergrad as well and passed the same with merit.\nShe is very precise at conveying concepts and is very patient with students. Individual approach, great advice, positive attitude. Always on time, ready to help, very easy going, intelligent and kind. Highly recommended and Thank you so much!"
