    "text": "One of the most annoying feelings in the world is when you have headphones on, you are trying to listen to some music, but the noise from outside is not letting you enjoy the music. It\u2019s a park, an airplane or any other place, you are bound to be interfered with because of the outside noise.\nSo what is the best way to get rid of all this unwanted noise and just focus on what you want to listen to? The answer is Noise Cancelling Headphones. With these headphones, the material used for the covers are blocked out all the sound from the outside so that you can enjoy your music without any distractions.\nThis list for best noise cancelling headphones under $100 looks at some of the best headphones available in the market and understand the features which make these headphones stand out from the rest.\nThe Cowin E7 are budget headphones which are made specifically for noise cancellation. The noise cancellation feature is, by far, the only feature that has helped the E7 to make its way to our list of best noise cancellation headphones. The headphones have compromised severely n sound quality which came out much muffled. Apart from that, the headphones are decent if you consider the price tag but not the best product if you take a look at its features.\nThe design for the Cowin e7 is an elegant one. However, where the pair of headphones starts looking cheap is the build quality. The headphones are not sturdy and make creaky noises when turned. The headphones are considerably comfortable for many users who do not have a problem with the headband extension. This is usually a problem when different people are using the same pair of headphones. The tight fit of the headphones makes them look stable and not as cheaply built as they actually are. Due to their less durability, these may not be the best headphones to go on a jog with.\nThe headphones are not well designed to handle heat and may warm your ears during a session of intense exercise. The headphones are still relatively more breathable than other designs and can allow you to exercise for almost an hour before they become irritating.\nConsidering the price of the headphones, the sound quality produced is justified. For $70, you do not get crystal clear sounds and a nice low range of music. However, the E7 lags way behind in terms of the sound. The mid-range for the headphone makes fluttering noises. While the bass is pretty consistent throughout the test periods, the bass sounds a bit boomy which hinders a nice listening session. The treble of the headphones lacks clarity which is why the sound quality also feel very cheap.\nApart from the extremely average sound quality of the part of headphones, the E7 also performs badly with the microphone. The voice from the microphone almost always sounds a bit muffled and is hardly audible in a somewhat noisy environment.\nThe noise cancellation aspect of the headphones is truly remarkable. The headphones work by creating a seal around the ear so that the sound does not leave the ears until and unless the headphones are removed. For commutes involving too much traffic, these headphones can be your perfect companion. However, if you use these at higher volumes, surrounding people can easily hear you and feel annoyed with the loud thumping noise.\nThe headphones have a pretty decent battery life of almost 24 hours. This battery life is calculated with continuous playback in mind so these are very good numbers. The headphones take a longer time to charge through and cannot be used to watch movies because of the problem of high latency.\nThis company is not one you would see competing with the big players in the industry. However, Bohm has worked tremendously to offer this beautiful product in the market which competes with big company names likes Bose, Limmer, and Sony. The beautiful design along with very useful features allow it to become part of the list of best noise cancelling headphones. This pair of headphones from the company is actually the first one which has gained some spotlight in the market. So, let us now judge the features and find out what exactly does the product offer in this sub-100 range.\nThe main feature for a pair of headphones is the sound quality. If the sound is no good, then there is no point in buying even a cheap pair of headphones. The Bohm B66 has performed exceptionally well in our sound test. The audio has great clarity with all the highs, lows and mid-range distinguished between each other. The sound was great when listening to music as well as when watching movies and did not show the slightest bit of distortion. The low ranges were done very well as the bass didn\u2019t thump like other cheap headphones.\nThe headphones boast a great upgrade in technology with their Bluetooth connectivity. The Bluetooth can be connected from your phone, tablet, laptop or even your smart TV. Although it does take a while at first, it works fine when you have paired the device once to your computer or phone. The Bluetooth remains connected even if the device goes a bit far because the range for it is almost 15 feet which is a lot for a pair of headphones.\nThe leather of the earpieces tends to get warm after long use. This may result in sweat accumulation and may not be the best decision to wear during a workout. This kind of problem is widespread in many other brands of headphones as well. The solution to this hasn\u2019t still been uncovered by any other brand.\nThe Bohm B66 also has a very long lasting battery life. After charging for about 3 hours, the headphones worked for almost 16 hours. This too, during continuous playback. These stats show a very impressive number as many tops of the line companies have failed to produce a pair of headphones which could last this long. One of the reasons why we felt that Bohm has to be added to the list of best noise canceling headphones under $100.\nBohm has used very high-quality materials to make the headphones in order to address the comfort demands of their customers. The pair is lightweight but at the same time very sturdy because Bohm has used aluminum for production. The ear cups were made with a leather material which was very smooth and comfortable.\nThe product is available in two different colors, Silver and black, or gold and tan. The two color combinations look extremely attractive paired with the beautiful design of the Bohm B66. It is a wonder how such a well-designed product is being sold for such a reasonable price.\nLeather ear cups get heated up after a long use.\nMonoprice has always been known for destroying its competition with high-quality products and very reasonable prices. If you are willing to spend your bucks on something that is the top of the line with a high price then no one is stopping you. But what if another company is making almost the same product for almost half the price? What do you do then? I know I would go for the cheaper one. Monoprice does exactly that. They create products that are almost a fraction of their competitor\u2019s price and they make it look extremely good.\nThe design of the headphones is relatively simple. The manufacturer has clearly gone for a minimalist design with shiny plastic used for ear cups. Although the shine does give birth to fingerprints on the surface, there is nothing a little polish cannot fill. All the other surfaces are clean and finished with matte which makes the maintenance process fairly easy. The headphone design makes them look very heavy when in actuality they are only 6.3 ounces making them fairly lightweight. The build is sturdy and they definitely do not look cheap. The grip of the headband is exceptional as it is just right. Not too tight and not too loose. The little bit of looseness allows for some air to flow through which helps to prevent sweat from accumulating.\nYou can easily store the headphones because they are foldable. This feature is not present in a vast number of high-quality headphones. The ear cups contain the battery compartment so you can store the batteries as well which are designed to give the headphones power for almost 50 hours. This is a pretty big number considering the price for this piece.\nThe sound quality may not be as good as those of other very high-quality headphones but for the products in this price range, this pair of headphones is a steal. The sound reproduced by the headphones is very good for background work where you are listening to music for leisure a=or just casually watching a movie. The noise canceling feature works pretty well and the hissing sound it makes when the mode is activated, fades away into the background. The noise canceling feature is obviously not as good as that of the Bose but it still works pretty well.\nThe product may seem very attractive to people who are just looking to buy headphones for casual usage but the slight difference in quality has a huge impact on professional usage because the noise cancelling feature and the slight distortion in sound is annoying if you are working on something analytical.\nOne of the best features of the Monoprice is the package it comes along with. The box has all the small wires and technical stuff that you may require. The best part about the box is that it contains a hard shell nylon case with an internal mesh pocket to keep the headphones safe.\nThe significant attention to detail is the reason why we included this pair of headphones in our list of best noise canceling headphones under 100.\nThe Avantree audition pro is one of those brands that may not be on the top of your list when you are considering to buy a pair of headphones which are great for gaming as well as reproduce good audio and good noise cancellation. However, when you realize how expensive brands like Sony and Bose are, you are bound to find a cheap substitute. That is where you will find the Avantree Audition Pro. The features promised by the product along with the reasonable price is what makes us add this pair of headphones to the list of Best Noise Cancellation headphones.\nThe audition Pro has an attractive design that has put extra emphasis on comfort. The earpieces are lined with leather which adds a very nice textured feel to it. The headphones are available in 2 different colors, black and brown and black and red. The design is built with resilience and it would take a lot of effort to damage the metallic frame of the headphones. The durability, therefore, is significant in the Audition pro.\nThe headphones have a mode called the bass boost. The bass boost can be activated and deactivated using the settings. With this boost, you can amplify the experience whether it\u2019s gaming, music or movies. We suggest, however, do not use the bass boost regularly because even though it gives you a loud thumping sound, it leaks more sound.\nThe sound quality considering the price tag is pretty decent. You will have to customize the equalizer settings to get the sound that soothes your ears but generally, the overall sound quality of the headphones is a bargain at this price. The trebles are clear and the low ranges, on top of being very immaculate, have a bass boost installed as well.\nThe headphones have one disadvantage which is that they do not have active noise canceling. This is the one big feature that other companies have over the Audition pro 2. Even after this difference, the headphones perform well in keeping the sound from leaking out.\nThe audition pro even delivers an ample battery life. According to the user manual, the company claims that the audition pro can get you almost 40 hours of wireless usage. That is a substantial amount when you compare it with those of the competitors. In the case that your battery dies, you can plug in your wire and use the headphones on wired mode. This is a feature that many headphones lack but the Audition Pro delivers.\nThe headphones are also great for working out and jogging. The material does not accumulate a lot of sweat and the headband of the headphones allows you to clamp it to your head so that the headphones do not fall off your head.\nThe Paww Wavesound 3 is one of the most complete headphones in our list of best noise canceling headphones under $100. These headphones give the user all they require. From an aesthetic design to a long battery life to good sound quality. The Paww Wavesound 3 offers all that you need at a reasonable price.\nThe design used for this headphone is an over the ear style. Although they look a bit bulky, they are incredibly comfortable and only take a short time for the user to get used to it. The headphones are big in size but are still relatively lightweight weighing in at less than 1 pound. You have the option of choosing from two colors.\nThe company has kept their style sophisticated and released the headphones in only black and white which means no funky, stylish colors for the fashion icons out there. The headphones are also very comfortable with a leather cushion on the headband and the thick cushions attached to the air piece. Such additions to the headphones make it much better for the user\u2019s overall satisfaction with the product.\nThe buttons to control the headphones are all on the right and left earpiece. You can control the track, the volume and Bluetooth connectivity buttons from the air piece which makes usage much more convenient.\nThe headphones are wired and wireless as well. The feature seems redundant in this age but the wired connection allows you to listen to the music even when you are charging the device. The company has worked hard on the connectivity aspect of the headphones make it easy to connect with Bluetooth devices as well. The range for Bluetooth that the company claims you can use it for is almost 33 feet. This is a very long distance and at first, we thought that this wouldn\u2019t be possible. On further inspection, we found out that the Bluetooth worked without any interference or obstruction and that too through a long distance.\nThe best feature of this product is the Active noise cancellation. This feature is rare in headphones but works exceptionally well in the Paww Waveosund 3. The technology works by blocking out almost 25 dB of noise from the outside. You could still distinguish significant sounds like passing cars or certain louder noises. However, for a reasonable price, the active noise cancellation works significantly well.\nOne of the best features of a company come in the form of response to customer criticism. Cowin has shown us with their newly upgraded E7 design that they strictly gauge what their customer requires and solves the problems that users face. The E7 model they released earlier, although a great pair of headphones, had plenty of issues which the customers complained about. However, in the updated model, all these issues have been taken care of. This brilliant response in the form of E7 has got Cowin in the list of best noise canceling headphones under $100.\nThe design has been considerably improved by adding the metallic look on the exterior. This aesthetic addition has added great value to the headphones. The size has been decreased to a certain extent which has made the headphones slightly more compact with the weight rounding off to about 1 pound. The drivers used in this speaker are relatively larger than the ones in the old model. These drivers have been increased in size to add to the bass response of the headphones. The clarity of the music has also significantly improved because of this slight modification.\nA feature of this pair of headphones which makes this a standout in our list of best noise canceling headphones under $100 is the fact that the design is an above ear design. This helps to avoid the sound from leaving the headphones so that people surrounding you do not hear it. This may seem like a trivial detail but this feature is what makes a good noise canceling a pair of headphones.\nThe headphones come in 3 different colors so you can choose from whatever you like. The white color gives off a slightly metallic look while the black is a fairly elegant look which goes more towards a professional look. The red, on the other hand, is one that is made for all the fashion enthusiast who likes to wear around the headphones for the sake of the outfit.\nAn area where the Cowin failed to make progress is the stutter of the headphones. The connectivity has some sort of issue with rapid movements which means that for certain quick movements, the speaker lags for a bit. This issue should have been fixed but, unfortunately, has not been taken care of.\nThe updated version of the speaker has improved on comfort with thicker ear cushions. These provide the sofa your ear needs when listening to some peaceful music. The surface of these cushions is smooth and is also designed to dissipate the heat off quickly for better usage. The headphone is also easier to clean because of the smoothness of the surface.\nOther significant improvements in the headphones are microphone attached to the headphones. There had been a lot of complaints regarding the microphone of the older model. This glitch is now fixed just like all the other glitches of the headphones.\nAnother area where the E7 has upgraded is the battery aspect of the speaker. The battery used is an 800mAh which makes this easily useable for almost 30 hours. This makes an increase of 25% from the last model.\nDuring recent times, Sennheiser has launched a number of new headphones. All of these were top of the line models and had features that couldn\u2019t be found in any other pair of headphones. The product had their issues but have been a huge success in today\u2019s market. Here, we discuss some of the features that make Sennheiser one of the best Noise canceling headphones available.\nThe Sennheiser HD 4.4 is not as sleek looking as its more expensive sibling. However, the design is made by the same manufacturer and the aesthetics can be seen the way the headphones look in their matte black color. To prevent noise from escaping the earpieces, the company has made bigger ear pieces which cover the ear fully and are thicker than the older models. The ear cups have power buttons on them as well including the forward, backward, volume buttons etc. The controls are a bit vague because there is no button to activate or deactivate the noise cancellation.\nOne of the things that Sennheiser missed out was the padding underneath the headband. Ironically, this is part of the headphones which gives you the most discomfort. Even after gauging the lack of quality here, it is still not as discomforting as the other products in the market.\nThe build quality of the headphone is pretty decent. However, the frame of the headphones does feel a bit less sturdy than its counterparts but we attribute this tradeoff with the lightweight feel of the headphones. The lightness does in no way correlate with the strength of the headphones. These are a durable pair and withstood all the violent throwing around abuse with ease.\nThe headphones are generally very comfortable with sufficient padding under the earpiece. While design and comfort are obviously very important for a pair of headphones. The most important part is the sound. The sound reproduced by the Sennheiser is amazing. The different sounds are easily distinguishable and extremely clear. The low end of the sound is deep and powerful with the sound of bass not too powerful as to overpower the other frequencies of sound. The midrange of the audio seems very clear as well. However, the higher part of the midrange has taken a bit of a hit and lacks quality.\nThe performance of the headphones is pretty decent if we take the price into consideration. The headphones give you almost 24 hours of continuous playback time which is sufficient for a pair of headphones of this category.\nOne of the oldest companies in the business, it is no surprise that Sony has made it way into our list of best noise canceling headphones under $100. The company has gone through ups and downs but has always made sure that it delivers the best quality to its customers. The WH-CH700N, which is an upgrade of a previous model, is a very decent pair of headphones. The sound quality of the headphones is good enough along with a beautiful design which makes these headphones look very attractive.\nThe design of the headphones is very similar to its previous model. However, on close inspection, you can see that the headphones are a bit compact. The ear cushions used on either side are softer to provide more comfort. The new model has also been made sturdier because of the countless complaints made by users about the old models very weak feel. The swivels on the headphones are made a bit more stable so that they do not get damaged during some harsh movements. The design does not have a lot of different unique features about it but gets the job done in a simple and elegant manner.\nThe design for the WH-CH700N is very sophisticated and adds that classy aesthetic touch to the headphone. The headphones are available in 2 colors which are matte grey and blue. So, for anyone who prefers simplistic designs without the flashy colors, this Sony speaker is a great choice.\nAlthough the company has worked hard on the design to make it more comfortable, they have lacked in terms of making the speakers breathable. The material used for the air cushions of the headphones allows minimal airflow which results in your ear becoming warm. For longer periods of listening, this may not be the perfect device.\nThe sound quality of the headphones is extremely average although it does perform well within a normal mid-range and gives a thumping bass, it has fallen short of a high rating because of the inconsistency of the bass and the mid-range. The hollow midrange results in the vocals and acoustic part of the audio to be at the back of the speaker which makes listening to vocals very difficult. The device may be an average, or even an above average for normal users, but may not be enough for professionals looking to get a headphone for sound mixing purposes.\nThe headphones can be used during traveling by carrying these in a bag. A feature that the headphones lack is a foldable design which can easily be portable. The way some other headphones close up into compact devices is very useful.\nLinner is one of those very few brands which have made a name for themselves in a very short span of time. The brand has only come out in recent years and with much less experience, had shocked us with the products they have released. The company works on reasonable prices and delivers good quality to the customer which is value for money.\nThe company has done an exceptional job in creating a pair of blue tooth wireless headphones which also follows the noise cancellation property very well. Even though the headphones are considerably cheaper than its competitors, it has still not compromised on the quality of the materials used to make one of the best noise canceling headphones under $100.\nAlthough many budget headphones claim that they have a noise canceling property, hardly any headphones deliver the high performance. The Linner NC80, however, has proven that even budget buys can end up giving you some of the best qualities you can get in a pair of headphones and that too for a very reasonable price. The noise cancellation mode can be activated or deactivated by pressing a button on the headphones through this mode, you can travel through a busy train or a loud airplane, peacefully.\nThe device, on top of having great noise cancellation features, also has degrees of noise cancellation. With this feature, you can either press 1 for slight noise cancellation or press 2 and get a very promising noise cancellation effect.\nLinner has definitely spent some time in the lab trying to figure out a beautiful design to go hand in hand with the immaculate performance of this product. The material used to manufacture the headphones is a very high-quality rubber and durable plastic.\nThe design also equips very comfortable ear cushions so that you can use the headphones for a longer period of time. All this material used does not make the pair of headphones a heavy product. Instead, they lie in the optimum weight zone for noise canceling headphones. Another thing that sets the Linner apart is the 18-month warranty given by the company for any sort of issues with the product. This has been a great way to get feedback and improve the product according to the user.\nThe sound quality of the headphones is very exceptional considering the fact that the pair of headphones is for a very reasonable price. The mic of the treble and bass does in no way show that this is a budget buy. Rather, the bass is said to be so good that no other headphones have been able to deliver it with such perfection.\nThe Linner NC50 is one of those headphones which can be used everywhere. During a walk, gym or just listening to music during a commute, the NC50 does in no way look like a cheap pair of noise canceling headphones which is exactly what the product is.\nA single wireless mode. No plug and play mode.\nFrom the analysis of our list of best noise-canceling headphones under $100, we believe that the Cowin E7 Pro released in 2018 is one of the best of the best. This pair of headphones has it all. From an attractive design to comfortable ear cushions and an immaculate noise cancellation technology, the E7 Pro delivers what other speakers cannot. There are of course some minor issues in the pair such as the lack of breathability in the design but considering how Cowin has fixed their previous designs, we can expect an improvement in this design as well. However, not much needs to be changed in the Cowin E7 because it performs very well."
