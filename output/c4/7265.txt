    "text": "Pepe Aguayo replaced Leo, Rafaga replaced Malefico. Rudos took 2/3.\nGuerreros took 1/3. Third fall finish saw the rudos pull some tricks involving Ultimo and Gran Guerrero swapping masks and sneaking in a foul on Mistico.\nMistico is in the center of every finish, so it\u2019s hard to figure if they plan on doing a singles match or a trios title match.\nElectro Boy replaced usual partner Atomic Star.\nElectro Boy worked twice, won twice. Emperador Azteca replaced Metaleon.\nGringos 7th defense. Gringos won when X-Fly meant to splash Eterno but got X-Fly instead. Eterno & Canis were highly annoyed with X-Fly for costing them the match.\nLady Maravilla\u2019s debut here in a win.\nTecnicos took 2/3. Electroshock beat Dos in the first and had him beat in the third, but got caught with La Mistica. Electroshock felt that was good enough to get him a title match, and Dos accepted.\nElectroshock versus Hijo de Dos is not a match that thrills me. There are not a lot of promising heavyweight matches. Lady Maravilla, a Monterrey regular, is probably not in the Mexico City metro area just to work indy shows.\nBlack Terry Jr. also has highlights of the opener.\nToday\u2019s CMLL show also has a Sky Team main event, this time against the Peste Negra trio of Niebla, Casas and Cavernario. This is Niebla\u2019s first Friday appearance since his latest return. It appears CMLL is planning a bigger week of shows starting with the Sunday April 26th shows, taking advantage of the Kid\u2019s Day boost and the Arena Mexico anniversary show. A Sky Team trios defense on one of the shows that week would make sense, and this is the only show they\u2019re being set up with one.\nSemimain has Sombra, Marco, Maximo vs Rey Escorpion, Thunder and Ultimo Guerrero, where we find out if Thunder still has a feud. Titan and Polvora match once again in a singles match. Narumiya (who visited from REINA back in October) returns for a couple weeks of shows. Narumiya did interviews yesterday reintroducing herself. She\u2019s now the CMLL-REINA International champion, having beat Amapola in Japan. Narumiya says she\u2019ll have no problem teaming with her tonight.\nSuperLuchas has nine reasons why the proposed lucha libre commission would be a poor idea. There\u2019s a lot here, but one of the important points is the whoever is regulating things needs to regulate lucha libre like a business (not an art) and the promotions need to be as well regulated or better than the wrestlers. None of the stated goals address the promotions, and it was the promotion\u2019s readiness which looked to be the initial problem with Perro Aguayo Jr.\u2019s death.\nMeanwhile, the Torreon lucha libre commission had a meeting to make their own new rules: luchadors will have their fitness tested more but won\u2019t be allowed to work two shows in a night.\nMore pictures of Drago & Pentagon Jr. playing Mortal Kombat X.\nRobViper has a music video of the second half of December 2014.\nSegunda Caida highly recommends Invasors vs Blue Panther, Fuego and Super Porky from 01/11.\nSuperLuchas notes yesterday is the anniversary of Villano II & Ray Mendoza\u2019s passing.\nLV reviews this week\u2019s CMLL C3 and Lucha Underground.\n+LuchaTV has Paranoiko and Pagano promos for tomorrow\u2019s DTU show.\nLuciferno talks about his new trio.\nLeyendas Inmortales has a 04/28 Queretaro main event of Canek, Octaogn, Heavy Metal vs Fuerza Guerrera, Psicosis II and Hechicero. Hechicero??? Also, Mr. Jack is losing his title in the semimain.\nWWL is back because \u201cthe fans demanded it\u201d. No actual show is announced.\nAlso: The FULL/Tineiblas show starts this weekend. It\u2019s even on TV Mexiquense\u2019s schedule for Sunday at noon, like a proper show, and they have a webfeed. It\u2019s only a half hour and I have no idea what\u2019s going to actually air or if you\u2019d like to watch it.\nNoches de Coliseo appears to be airing on the Multimedios US on Monday morning sometime after 3AM. Convenient for everyone.\nThe women\u2019s title match airing on Fox seems like the lock of locks.\nThe four matches listed for AAA are the ones left over from SLP; it\u2019s possible the minis opener doesn\u2019t air.\nLucha Underground has only two matches listed. There\u2019s reasons. That tag tournament goes for a while.\nEscorpion & Valiente didn\u2019t air in Mexico, may get pulled for the women\u2019s match again.\nThe rest of last week\u2019s IWRG did turn up and will go up next week."
