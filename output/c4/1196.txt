    "text": "From the people who brought you the massive Hangar One at Moffett Field, The Empire State Building and Hoover Dam, comes arguably the grandest, most scenic (and most insane) roller coaster idea of ALL TIME!\nThe stats for this proposed duo of coasters are simply staggering. 1,000 feet tall \u2013 750 foot drops \u2013 a 190 mph top speed. Even by today\u2019s standards, these two coasters would have easily kept their records for height and speed.\nBy comparison, the Transamerica Pyramid \u2013 which was built in 1972 and is the tallest building in San Francisco \u2013 is 850 feet tall.\nThe tallest roller coaster in the world currently is Kingda Ka at Six Flags Great Adventure. It tops out at a measly 456 feet high. Formula Rossa in the UAE is the fastest in the world, at a yawn inducing 149 mph. Heck, even the \u201cbunny hills\u201d on these coasters were proposed to do 40 mph over them\u2026at 1,000 feet in the air!\nDouble the height of Kingda Ka, and it still wouldn\u2019t be as tall as the proposed \u201cGolden Gate Thunderbolt\u201d roller coaster!\nThe folks in the Depression sure thought bigger than we do today, and it\u2019s understandable. It was a dark time for America \u2013 and people needed something \u2013 anything \u2013 in order to lift their spirits. What better way than to build something that was (and may never be) seen by human eyes?\nI\u2019m not exactly sure how they would have propelled the ride at such speeds, or how to get it up there to begin with \u2013 I know for a fact that Cal OSHA would laugh the proposal right out the door in today\u2019s litigious world\u2026not to mention it\u2019s pretty clear the physics of a ride with that much wind resistance would never be able to complete its circuit!\nIronically, two identical roller coasters WERE built at each of the 1939 Expositions in New York and San Francisco. After the fair ended in New York, the ride was eventually moved\u2026to Riverside Park in Massachusetts, eventually becoming Six Flags New England \u2013 where it still runs today as \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 \u201cThunderbolt,\u201d the same name proposed for the rides on the bridges.\nThunderbolt at Six Flags New England.
