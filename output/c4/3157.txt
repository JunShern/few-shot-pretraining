    "text": "Thanks to Meghan Markle, black pants are no surprise on a royal outing \u2014 but when Kate Middleton decided to opt for the look, we had to do a double take. On Dec. 5, the Duchess of Cambridge stepped out with Prince William at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus, wearing black wide-leg pants and the very appropriately named Smythe Duchess Blazer ($695), which she paired with a white t-shirt and an L.K.Bennett Dora clutch ($285). And this time, the casual look wasn't to play sports.\nWhile Kate often wears pants if she's participating in physical activity or visiting a center where she is expected to interact with the public, she typically goes for jeans and heels and rarely for wide-leg trousers. For this look, we can't help but wonder whether she's taken a styling tip from her sister-in-law, Meghan, who's more than once worn pants and a blazer on an official outing.\nAhead, get a closer look at Kate's outfit \u2014 as well as a few of the times Meghan's worn this kind of ensemble \u2014 then shop similar pieces to re-create the look for yourself. Honestly, we won't blame you if you've already decided to dig out your pants and favorite blazer for work tomorrow."
