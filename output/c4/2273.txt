    "text": "In the second article in her series on comfort, Aren Cohen considers the expression \u201ccreature comforts.\u201d A phrase originally intended to highlight the material possessions and luxuries that provide us with comfort, Aren explores how it works the other way around. Comfort can make us fully realized beings. Comfort can make us happy and brave creatures.\nThe first of a series of articles, Aren Cohen investigates the notion of Comfort and why it is a complex and relatively under-examined idea in positive psychology. Does experiencing comfort open the way to contentment, interest, and love? How does offering comfort soothe or console? Does comfort stem from attachment? What role does comfort play for children learning new things? Come explore this multi-faceted word.\nRecently, I took a wonderful vacation with my husband to Argentina and Brazil. Since I had been busy before our departure, I had done only minimal research on site-seeing or dining. I happily entrusted myself to Andre and embraced his \u201cgo with the flow\u201d approach to travel. I would like to share some thoughts on the VIA Strengths I found amplified on our trip. For the sake of brevity and relevance I will focus on the following eight.\nOne of my favorite YouTube videos, called \u201cFree Hugs,\u201d shows a young man, then a group of people, standing in a mall in Australia offering free hugs. Why did I wake up this morning thinking about \u201cFree Hugs?\u201d First, I read an op-ed piece in the New York Times with the fact that \u201cmore people live alone now than at any other time in history.\u201d Second, I watched the amazing HBO movie about a woman named Temple Grandin who invented a \u201csqueeze machine\u201d for herself.\nIs music positive psychology? Music is not a solitary thing. Musical tastes not only become a mark of personal identity, but they also help create social bonding and cohesion. Music is indeed both primal and powerful, thus the potential it has to serve positive psychology is awesome.\nAll of us have this constant monologue of chatter running in our head. How do our perspectives and languages habituate our inner monologue? This inner monologue sometimes is great and sometimes it is lousy. How best can we train our inner voices to be more loving, more supportive, more friendly, more forgiving, and more productive?\n\u201cThou Shalt Not Envy\u201d is the 10th commandment Moses brought down from Mount Sinai. Envy certainly gets a bad name everywhere you look. Nonetheless, it is part of the human condition. Does envy have a place in the world of Positive Psychology? Are there ways that can envy can benefit humanity?\nBut if men and women communicate so differently, how do we ever find the words to fall in love? And, more importantly, what makes one person\u2019s words seems so right to us? What makes us \u201clike the way he/she talks,\u201d so that we click and fall in love?\nRecent research shows that good posture is important for reasons besides a healthy spine. Researchers at the Kellogg School of Management and Stanford Graduate School of Business found that our posture has a significant effect on our behavior. They found that posture, more than a person\u2019s actual rank or hierarchical role in an organization (i.e. job title), is likely to dictate how a person will think and act.\nThanksgiving is a great positive psychology holiday. In fact, thanksgiving, not as a holiday but as a phenomenon, is part of positive psychology lingo, appearing in Fred Bryant and Joseph Veroff\u2019s model of savoring. Thanksgiving is a reflection on what the world has to offer us and why we should celebrate it.\nOur choice of words reveals a lot about us. Tal Yarkoni from the University of Colorado published the results of an extensive study looking at what bloggers write. The article examined correlations between personality traits and word use, using a sample of almost 700 bloggers who had written an average of over 115,000 words over almost two years.\nI watch The Daily Show with Jon Stewart religiously. Instead of CNN, Fox or MSNBC, my news source of choice is Comedy Central. Why, you may ask? Don\u2019t I want to be a well-informed citizen? Shouldn\u2019t I be reading the New York Times and taking things seriously. Maybe. But in today\u2019s environment, I desperately need a laugh."
