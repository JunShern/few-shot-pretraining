    "text": "LEMON TREE - Marquez Laundry Theatre Co.\nArtefacts is a storytelling exhibition and a collaborative effort between artists and the public, bringing together some diverse and compelling cross-cultural works by visual and performing artists from two seemingly disparate but very distinctive disciplines.. This exhibition is curated and initiated by Sydney curator Arthur Chan, whilst the original exhibition was held in 2014 at Melbourne's Chinese Museum.\nEach of these events starts with an official welcome and a prepared program, followed by featured talent showcasing their works, then a conversation with both of the artist and performer before concluding with a brief Q&A session."
