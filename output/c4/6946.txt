    "text": "Closing date for nominations: 4pm Wed 3rd April.\nWhy would you want to become a Parish Councillor?\nYou can help protect and shape the future of this beautiful parish we all live in.\nYou will learn more about our Parish, it\u2019s people, it\u2019s geography, it\u2019s past and, most importantly, it\u2019s future.\nAnyone who lives in our Parish over the age of 18yrs can, and some might say should, spend some time as a councillor to fully understand our wonderful environment.\nAn election is coming up and will take place on Thursday May 2nd.\nThere are nine places to fill.\nWelcome to Staverton Parish comprising the villages of Staverton & Landscove in South Hams, South Devon.\nIn addition to providing regularly updated information on events, this website was conceived of as a way to connect the community more closely with their elected representatives, the Staverton Parish Council. Staverton Parish encompasses the villages of Landscove and Staverton along with some smaller hamlets.\nA separate section of this site is used by the parish council to post information such as agendas, minutes etc. Use the menu on the left to navigate to parish council pages.\nI run this site in my spare time. Several other people now have access to add events, but the more people contributing to the site, the better. So if you\u2019re interested in getting involved, please email me using this contact form or give me a buzz on 762 740. You don\u2019t need to be a technical whizz to add events or news posts.\nThis site builds on the website originally created back in 1996 by Graham and Jain Wood. Many thanks to Jain for allowing me to use much of the original content."
