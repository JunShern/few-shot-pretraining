    "text": "Sudan (HRNW): Sudan\u2019s military has an \u201coverarching duty\u201d to refrain from using violence against protesters and ensure that their human rights are protected amid concerns of a further escalation, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet said on Friday. Her comments followed the ousting of President Omar al-Bashir, announced on State television on Thursday, accompanied by the declaration from the defence minister, that a military council would govern the country for up to two years. Those developments come amid protests that erupted nearly four months ago when the Government attempted to raise the prices of bread and basic commodities, and which are also believed to have claimed dozens of lives.\nSpeaking in the Security Council on Friday morning, Sudan\u2019s Deputy Ambassador, Yasir Abdullah Abdelsalam, said that the military council\u2019s imposition of a State of Emergency for three months, a suspension of the constitution and nightly curfew, had been done in response to \u201cthe demands of the crowds\u2026who have expressed their aspirations and their demands\u201d He said the military council was committed to respecting all international agreements, and \u201ca peaceful transition\u201d, in which it would be the \u201cguarantor\u201d of a return to \u201ccivilian government\u201d. \u201cNo party will be excluded\u201d from the future electoral process, he added, including armed groups. He told Council member the suspension of the constitution \u201ccould be lifted at any point\u201d and the transitional period back to civilian rule \u201ccould be shortened, depending on developments on the ground and agreements reached between stakeholders\u201d.\n\u201cThis is a very critical, volatile moment for Sudan and there is deep uncertainty and unease about the future,\u201d High Commissioner Bachelet said in a statement, delivered in Geneva by Ravina Shamdasani, from the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). In an update to journalists, Ms. Shamdasani said that it was \u201cencouraging that there was no violence overnight\u201d in the capital Khartoum \u2013 \u201ceven though the curfew that had been imposed was not respected by peaceful protesters\u201d. The OHCHR official also noted unconfirmed reports that some political detainees had been released, before urging the authorities to release all political prisoners.\nHowever, amid uncertainty about how the crisis might play out, Ms. Shamdasani noted that the demonstrators might be unwilling to accept the military council\u2019s declaration. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to get into details on who our sources are, but there are clear indications from them that they are not happy with what happened yesterday and that the protests will continue,\u201d Ms. Shamdasani said. \u201cWhich, again, is why we are calling on the authorities to address the people\u2019s demands.\u201d Reiterating the High Commissioner\u2019s comments, Ms. Shadasani noted that the protests against President Bashir stemmed from widespread human rights grievances: economic, social, civil and political.\n\u201cWe also understand that the announcement that was made yesterday didn\u2019t indicate any possibility for people to participate in this transition,\u201d she said. \u201cWhich is why we are, again, calling on the authorities to ensure that there\u2019s a concerted effort with the meaningful participation of civil society, of dissenting voices, in charting a way forward.\u201d Asked whether former president Bashir should stand trial on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity including genocide linked to violence in Darfur \u2013 issued by the International Criminal Court in 2009 and 2010 \u2013 Ms. Shamdasani said: \u201cWe would encourage the Government of Sudan to fully cooperate with the International Criminal Court\u201d. \u201cWe are also calling for full accountability, including for the use of excessive force that has taken place since December this year\u201d.\nBe the first to comment on \"Sudan military committed to \u2018ensuring stability\u2019 and \u2018peaceful transition\u2019 says senior diplomat\""
