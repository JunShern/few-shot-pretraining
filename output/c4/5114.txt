    "text": "I celebrated Mothers\u2019 Day twice this year: both on the holiday as celebrated last Thursday in Mexico and again on Sunday in the U.S. (In Mexico, they keep a fixed date of May 10, whereas in the states we change the date around to keep it as the second Sunday in May).\nThough I\u2019m usually out in Teotitl\u00e1n del Valley every Thursday anyway teaching English classes as part of En V\u00eda\u2019s loan enrichment program, we had cancelled class for the fiesta. Not only would most of our students and their families be attending the Mothers\u2019 Day celebration in Teotitl\u00e1n, but the entire municipal building where we hold classes, as well as the town plaza just outside, would be occupied with the fiesta. Honestly, there\u2019s always a fiesta going on in town. Or a parade. Or both.\nI had stopped by the weaving shops of a couple of En V\u00eda borrowers on the way to the fiesta, including Josefina, who was one of the program\u2019s very first loan recipients. Mother of four children herself, her youngest, six-year-old Maria Jos\u00e9, was getting ready to participate in a dance for the celebration. Josefina helped her into her full, ruffled skirt and embroidered blouse. Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 was hopping around so excitedly she almost couldn\u2019t stand still enough for her mother to add a little lipstick and blush.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the name of your dance,\u201d I asked her? \u201cThe caballito dance!\u201d she squealed. Kidding, I asked her if she was a caballita (little horse). \u201cNo, silly!\u201d she said. \u201cThe boys are the caballitos!\u201d And not wanting her to be late \u2013 for hers was the first dance of the event \u2013 we piled into a moto-taxi and headed to the town square.\nThe whole plaza was covered with a big white tent, good insurance not only against the blazing afternoon sun, but also for the possible showers in this early rainy season. Up against the steps of the municipal building were piled a beribboned stack of door prizes for the raffle: woven market baskets and a host of coveted household goods like dishes, glasses, pitcher and glass sets, blenders and the clear king: a full-sized refrigerator.\nAt least half the town\u2019s 6,000 or so residents turned out for the day\u2019s festivities. The older gentlemen wear slacks and straw hats, the women traditional plaid skirts (actually just pieces of cloth tied with a sash), floral blouses, braids and rebozos, or shawls, on their shoulders or heads.\nBeing at least six inches and sometimes a whole foot taller than most of the indigenous women (and I\u2019m only 5\u20196\u201d, not exactly a giant in the states), I guess I stood out in the crowd in my turquoise visor. At least a dozen women, former and current students in the English classes and weavers I know from town, shouted out greetings to me as we waited for the fiesta to begin. I can manage \u201chello\u201d in Zapotec, but not much more; it\u2019s a tonal language, all soft sounds pitched inflections. (But of course, they all speak Spanish too (which means our English classes introduce a third language).\nThe traditional nieve served on Mothers\u2019 Day \u2013 prepared in the municipal building where we normally hold English classes \u2013 was brought out on trays and passed around to all free of charge. Nieve is a frozen treat more like sorbet than ice cream, and these were festively red and white: white leche quemada ice cream (literally \u201cburned milk,\u201d like a vanilla custard) with a topping of rosy pink tuna (which has nothing to do at all with tuna fish, but is made of the red fruit of the prickly pear cactus).\nThe band began to play, the first dancers came out. The caballitos pranced and threw their handkerchiefs down; the little girls (including Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9) danced and smiled and completely captivated the crowd. Alas, I didn\u2019t get to stay for the whole fiesta; the last bus from Teotitl\u00e1n back to Oaxaca leaves at 6 p.m. and you\u2019d better be on it if you don\u2019t want to be waiting down on the highway three miles away to catch a ride back to the city in the dark.\nI ate the piece of sweet corn cake, given to me at the fiesta by one of my students, on the bus back to Oaxaca City (about an hour away), and got soaking wet walking back home from the bus stop in the rain. Nothing, though, could dampen the wonderful feeling of belonging here, with my own children so far away on Mothers\u2019 Day.\nAnd yeah, the kids (who turn 26 and 28 this week). Bryan, the younger one, called me on Sunday morning to wish me happy American Mothers\u2019 Day. He was sitting with his girlfriend at the feet of the Grand Tetons outside of Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where he lives. My older son, David, Skyped me that night from Katmandu, Nepal, just having trekked back from Everest Base Camp One, halfway through his trip around the world this year.\nKids grow up and if you\u2019re lucky in this economy, they leave home. My own left not just the house but the state and even the country, as did I. I used to be a suburban Dallas housewife and now -- I\u2019m not. And in choosing a new place to live, I\u2019ve gotten to choose new family as well to stand in as my own.\nHappy Mother\u2019s Day! Recognising the ways that Mothers Invest for the Future.\nThe great majority of the women that En Via works with are mothers. Today we wish to recognise the ways in which as mothers and businesswomen, women are working hard to provide for their children and families.\nAmeli and her son Axel, in Diaz Ordaz.\nOne of the primary reasons that En Via lends money to women is that statistically, women have shown to invest in ways that directly benefit their families and communities. We see this time and time again as we hear that profits from businesses are used to support children through school, or to provide them with healthcare, or other essential aspects of their development.\nWe know that each individual loan is making an impact on the lives of many people because we know that the women we work with are sharing not only the financial profits of their projects and businesses with their families, but also the knowledge and self-esteem that comes from their participation in the program as a whole.\nAmelia and her daughter and expected baby boy, in Teotitlan.\nRecently we had the pleasure of visiting with one of our borrowers, Enedina Gonzalez Alvarez, with a tour group. Enedina is a weaver, and like many of our borrowers, she invests her loans in a family business that produces tapetes, or wool rugs. Her husband and children introduce themselves to us as we arrive, and it is clear to everyone that the family is a very close unit.\nOscar, Enedina's 17 year old son, hurries over with something to show the group; a great big bag of seed pods that will be used for naturally dying the wool the family will use for weaving. His face is glowing with pride as he stands by his mother as she explains the process to us.\nLater I ask him what he thinks about the En Via program. Regarding the tours, he said he loves to have the chance to meet new people and interact with visitors. \u201cThe loans help our family and other families we know a lot\u201d, he says seriously.\nEnedina and her sons Oscar and Romero in Teotitlan.\nI often wonder about the type of role models that are being encouraged and created, and am delighted to hear Oscar say that he is learning from his mother and family about how the money is best managed.\nEnedina tells me how one of her favourite parts of the work is the way she works everyday with her family. They have 4 looms that are arranged side by side in the patio.\nOscar says that they exchange ideas, and even sing together sometimes as they weave. \u201cI enjoy the time when we are together. When I am by myself working I feel lonely\u201d, he says.\nRomero, Enedina's younger son of 14 years, is also interested in the visit from En Via. \u201cI think it is a good program that is helping the community\u201d, he says. \u201cI am proud of my mother, and I am grateful for what she teaches me\u201d.\nThere are mothers of all ages and backgrounds in our program. Many have told me personally that the most important thing in their lives is being a mother. We have the privilege of knowing many of their children and of seeing them grow and develop over the years we have been working in the communities. All of us at En Via wish to congratulate all the mothers of the program for their hard work, and for the ways in which they continue to support their families as well as their communities as a whole. To all mothers everywhere, Happy Mother's Day!\nRosa, a single mother, stands with her daughters outside her house in Tlacochahuaya.\nFighting poverty around Oaxaca, and educating travelers from around the world about the power of microfinance."
