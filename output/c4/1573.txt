Some are better than others, and all are horrendously overpriced by any normal standards, but there are some gems, and this one seems to be in that special category.\nOf course it\u2019s not at all related to the old Warhammer Quest really \u2013 it\u2019s all about the IP these days isn\u2019t it? \u2013 but that\u2019s a good thing, as the game here is more fun and interesting than that venerable but creaky dungeoncrawler. With bits of dice allocation (a la Claustrophobia) and paragraph reading (Tales of the Arabian Nights) in the mix and some decent variety in the scenarios, there\u2019s something to please everyone.\nDespite the premium cost, corners are still visibly being cut, which is a shame. The creatures could have had their own reference cards, for example. As usual, those not interested in assembling and painting miniatures certainly have their work cut out for them before they start playing. And I do think there could have been less small minis to fill out the miniature count.\nBut the minis you do get are incredibly detailed and high quality, and it\u2019s good to see a bit of experimentation with the dungeoncrawler form. Though why are so many GW characters leaping into the air these days?"
