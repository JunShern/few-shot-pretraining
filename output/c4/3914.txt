    "text": "In my gut, poop was the answer. But I didn\u2019t really know\u2014it could just be one of those days.\nIf there was success, I\u2019d feel vindicated. And if the little one spent the better part of our afternoon on and off the toilet, if dinner time rolled around and there was nothing to show for it? Then? I\u2019d feel awful.\nI took a deep breath, walked passed Nadia, and gathered myself for yet another round of hand holding, humming, board book \u201creading,\u201d and 1-2-3-push!-ing and entered the bathroom.\nUp to this point in my children's lives, I have given myself the labels of Best Mom and Worst Mom more times than I can remember.\nThere was the time I decided that Nadia, as a baby, should cry it out for nap time; she ended up working herself up so badly she vomited all over the carpet. And the time I was in the bathroom and my son shocked himself (with real electricity) by trying to pry off the baby-proofed outlet covers with a metal spatula. Once, I went to get my kids new shoes the lady told me the ones my kids were wearing were two sizes too small. From forgetting it was pajama day to losing my temper to turning to talk to a friend while a little one jumped without his wings into the pool. Worst mom, worst mom, worst mom, worst mom.\nBut there have also been times I\u2019ve called myself Best Mom. Like when I caught one of my boys from falling off his changing table when he decided to roll over for the first time. It was one of those spectacular, one-handed, sixth sense type of things\u2014because I wasn\u2019t even looking. Or the time I insisted my child hold my hand in the parking lot, only to reactively pull him out of the way when a car started to back up in front of us. From the times I just knew I should go check on the kids who were playing too quietly, to the times my kiss made everything better. Best, best, best, best.\nWhen I first had kids, everything was new and unknown. It was like I was feeling my way around in the dark, stumbling over pacifiers and piles of burp cloths left on the floor and stubbing my toes on the legs of a coffee table. But in time I adjusted to the lay of the land. I learned to maneuver through motherhood without having to think too hard about the once-overwhelming obstacles.\nBut at each new chapter, I\u2019ve revisited the same disorientation and desire to figure things out. To get it right. To seek after being the Best Mom and avoid being the Worst.\nI know it\u2019s not right. But this is my nature.\nThis past summer, Nadia began attending youth group at our church, riding her bike independently to and from swim practice, and generally having more freedom. This month, she started middle school.\nMy Best Mom and Worst Mom labels for this next chapter of our lives lay on my kitchen table \u2026 right next to composition notebooks and a house key for which this once-baby is now responsible.\nWithout any interest in entering into a public dialogue or debate of its necessity versus perils, I will simply state that our middle schooler doesn\u2019t have a phone. (Yet.) But, we\u2019re happy to have her friends over whenever she wants. We give her a bedtime she considers way too early. But she has clothes and shoes and food and parents who are trying to figure out the balance between pretty involved and too hands-off. She\u2019s allowed to read anything she wants, but we set limits on what she watches. She has daily \u201cresponsibilities,\u201d but she\u2019s also allowed to use our technology to FaceTime her cousins and text her friends.\nAt any given moment these days, I could be the Best Mom or the Worst Mom.\nMy own mom passed away before I ever had kids. But I\u2019d love to ask her if she felt this pull between Best and Worst. I\u2019d love to know if she had the same kind of moments I\u2019ve had throughout my entire motherhood journey, the ones where I feel like I\u2019m either crushing it\u2014or am at a complete loss. Did she fist pump the air when she made a good call from little more than her intuition? Did she go to bed with a crumpled forehead and a heaviness on her chest, the way I do some nights, after a day where my friable patience ripped apart from the very smallest of irritations?\nMy youngest did poop that day, and I did feel proud of myself. (Strong work, momma, you knew it. #Bestmom) But what I said to my oldest daughter stuck with me. Am I really \u201cthe Best\u201d when I make a good call, and \u201cthe Worst\u201d when I do something wrong?\nI\u2019m so quick, so quick!, to judge myself on merit. To give myself a worthiness when I accomplish, produce, achieve, protect, or correctly guess. And I let myself take on feelings of guilt and shame, lack and inferiority\u2014even grief\u2014when I don\u2019t.\nThis is not how it\u2019s meant to be, I know. Grace is sufficient, right?\nBecause I don\u2019t always carry this truth into motherhood.\nFor my sake (and for my kids\u2019) I know I need to shift my thinking. I need to stop operating in such a binary, black and white, un-nuanced way. Because no matter how strongly we want to slap a label on ourselves in the moment, we are not judged by one point in time.\nWe all mistake the hungry cry for the I\u2019m wet cry, and shyness for control issues, or embarrassment for indifference, and tiredness for needing to poop. We all look away. Don\u2019t go check. Let go of hands. Feel so done at the end of the day. And it doesn\u2019t make any of us Better or Worse. Maybe it\u2019s just part of the journey.\nThere is grace for those who knock it out of the park, and grace for those who are just getting through the day. There is grace over our mistakes and grace over the circumstances not even in our control.\nWe are not the Best or the Worst.\nWe are simply Mom, as it was meant to be, and it\u2019s sufficient."
