    "text": "Director Patty Jenkins has revealed details about the upcoming sequel.\nIf we've learned anything from our era of superhero movies, it's that no one is actually really dead. At the end of Wonder Woman, Chris Pine's Steve Trevor heroically sacrifices himself to save everyone else. It marked the death of some great on-screen chemistry between Pine and Gal Gadot.\nBut today, director Patty Jenkins has revealed the first details about the upcoming sequel, Wonder Woman 1984. It takes place in, well, 1984, and somehow marks the return of Pine's Steve Trevor. Jenkins tweeted a photo of Pine on set for the film, and he's got a great fit with a Member's Only jacket and a vintage Casio watch. He also looks pretty damn good for being either dead or at least 90 years old. Considering this is a superhero movie there are any number of reasons why Trevor would still be alive.\nThis sequel has Wonder Woman squaring off against The Cheetah, played by Kristin Wiig. While there have been a few versions of The Cheetah, all the characters have roughly the same powers, which \"consists of enhanced strength and speed well beyond that of the most powerful felines, as well as heightened senses of smell and hearing for hunts and night-vision for stealth. Their reflexes and agility are similarly augmented, allowing them superior gymnastic and parkour feats for inhuman mobility. These superhuman traits allow them to challenge Wonder Woman in physical battles. Additionally, their fangs and claws are preternaturally sharp and strong.\"\nAnyway, we'll know for sure when the movie is out on November 1, 2019."
