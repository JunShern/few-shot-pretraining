    "text": "First, the TSA locks do not secure the luggage very well. They are easily cracked.\nSecond, the TSA does cut off the lock if it isn't a TSA lock, and often cuts off the lock if it is a TSA lock.\nThird, having made sure we cannot secure our luggage, they then pass these unscreened items on to non TSA personnel.\nYes, it is fair to blame the TSA.\nIf TSA locks are being cut off cause the officers are too lazy to get the TSA keys for them out of a cabinet then that needs to be brought up so the action can be corrected. Oh this makes the \"secret shopper\" idea more plausible. They can travel with TSA locks on their baggage. There is no reason for this TSA. Your officers are failures if they do not know how to recognize and use TSA approved locks and keys.\n(1) Even my breakfast cereal box is more difficult to open than a \"TSA Approved\" toy luggage lock.\n(2) Putting a high quality lock on one's luggage is simply an invitation to the TSA underwear checkers to destroy the lock or the luggage to get inside.\n(3) In too many cases TSA even cuts off TSA approved locks, then leaves the destroyed lock inside the now unprotected luggage with one of their little \"TSA was here\" love notes.\n(4) Even with TSA pre-approval (such as when firearms are in checked luggage), a quality lock placed on luggage AFTER TSA INSPECTION to prevent casual theft is sometimes cut off by yet another TSA dolt somewhere down the line.\n(4) With TSA using their current poorly though out methods, there is NO way to adequately protect one's belongings from TSA, and because of that no way to protect one's belongings from others down the line.\nWith so may valuables not allowed in carry-ons, one is forced to place valuables in checked luggage with no way to protect them.\nGlad my spin on Ponter's post increased your enjoyment. Please keep blogging.\nI can't think of any excuse for cutting a TSA approved lock and then placing it in the bag with the \"love note\". I have, however seen locks of all quality (and straps and luggage tags) get caught in the conveyor belts and ripped right off.\nFor a time we (TSA) were securing the closures of bags that we had checked (whether they were initially locked or not) with plastic zip ties. Realizing that anything sharp enough to remove the zip ties wasn't allowed through the screening checkpoint - it was inside the bag we'd just secured this practice was discontinued.\nThey haven't come up with anything else yet.\nTo All - I never, never, post on this blog from a computer at work!\nTSA Approved locks are not much more than a hollow shell.\nPretty much like the hollow shell of all TSA Security Theater.\nYou know as well as I do that what TSA does is to make people \"feel\" safe, not to provide security!\n\"People its a zipper on your bag. A ZIPPER! No kind of lock is preventing access to your bag\"\n..and since TSA policies leave our bags vulnerable to both theft and the insertion of bombs a zipper is all we need.\nIf we are ever allowed to secure our bags again, many of us will move to more secure lugage.\nPeople its a zipper on your bag. A ZIPPER! No kind of lock is preventing access to your bag.\nExcept, of course, for my old hard-sided Samsonite suitcase, with honest-to-goodness latches and a built-in lock. Which, of course, I can never use again, because I have to leave it unlocked to comply with TSA regulations.\nQuote from James: \"he point I am making is your bag is not secure unless TSA did something like the strapping idea I have seen.(Costs to much)\"\nActually, with the way TK proposed it, it wouldn't be that expensive and certainly would be cheaper than a lot of the things TSA currently wastes money on. Like cop uniforms that cause rashes.\nBut farbeit from TSA to spend money on something that would increase security rather than waste money or put on a good show. I'm beginning to think that unless it's invasive and/or rights infringing, TSA isn't willing to spend money on it.\n\"By the way, there has still been no answer to my question as to how the bloggers even got these positions and why they weren't advertised on the job site.\nJanuary 8, 2009 11:10 AM\"\nWow! I've seen this question asked before and still no answer! Guess we all know who has friends in the organization!\nWould you really want to have blogger Bob's job? He is gets thrashed and has to answer questions over and over again.\nAnd as to my post about the zipper bags. The majority of bags have zippers. Some luggage is more secure, hard-sided, pelican cases. I am speaking of more common luggage.\nCarrot Top TSO, you're absolutely right. The TSA was indeed thrown together in the aftermath of the horribly embarrassing failure of 9/11. The main intent was to convince the terrified public that the government was Doing Something in reaction, and therefore they should feel it was safe to fly. It seems to have been successful at that short-term aim.\nUnfortunately, the well-intended officials who came up with the TSA decided that \"nothing succeeds like excess.\" If the hastily conceived security theater was so successful at restoring public confidence, clearly more of the same would be even better! They were sure that if they made airport screening enough of a hassle, everyone will then be completely convinced that it must be effective. So it won't matter that every test or audit consistently shows that it isn't. They make us take off our shoes and confiscate our gel packs and unlabeled one-ounce shampoo bottles, so we can see for ourselves that they obviously must be extraordinarily effective at protecting us from terrorists carrying box cutters!\nSo they built a palace to house the top executives, erected a Wall of Secrecy, and bought a big box of stamps to mark every rule and operating procedure \"SSI.\" They gave their screeners the fancy title of \"Transportation Security Officer,\" bought them all itchy formaldehyde-laced uniforms with badges, empowered them to capriciously \"interpret\" vaguely-defined arbitrary rules, and effectively encouraged them to abuse their authority by issuing glowing press releases standing resolutely behind TSOs whenever an incident (such as that woman with the piercings) gets enough publicity to be embarrassing.\nWhen too many passengers started complaining about the arbitrary inconsistency and the obvious holes in the system, Kip called in Propaganda Minister Karl Rove. Rove advised him to re-brand all that arbitrary inconsistency as a powerful \"Security Strategy\" of unpredictability that would keep the terrorists off-balance. Rove also advised Kip that fear is the only defense against liberal enemies who, in their hatred of America, question or criticize the TSA, calling it \"security theater\" or \"ineffective.\"\nRove's script called for Kip himself to deflect all questions by repeatedly reminding everyone to think of 9/11 as often as possible, and repeatedly insisting that the TSA is highly effective at protecting the Homeland from enemies who are trying to kill Americans. For lesser threats like people who write uncomplimentary comments on this blog, the appropriate strategy is to just repeat the party line once and then ignore the commenters in the hope that they'll just go away. And it's also essential to put out periodic glowing press releases about spectacular successes in finding drug paraphernalia, cash, and fake military jackets. How then could anyone deny that the TSA is vigilant about protecting aviation, even if what they found is no threat to aviation. The important thing is that they found something suspicious, which incontrovertibly proves that the TSA is highly effective!\nReading about the TSA and recalling my own \"experiences\" at checkpoints used to bring me to tears of frustration. This blog is no exception. But then I recalled Stephen Sondheim's advice to \"laugh at the kings, or they'll make you cry.\" So perhaps sarcasm might be more effective than serious questions or criticism. I don't know if my attempt was effective, but it's interesting that some people thought I was serious. And in a sense I was, since my post was merely a compendium of official statements Kip and others have made, presumably following Rove's advice to spin away the criticism.\nCarrot Top TSO, I am heartened that there are people like you within the TSA who recognize and admit their agency's shortcomings, and who have a sense of humor. Both of those are necessary within the TSA if that agency is ever going to provide effective security rather than merely intrusive and annoying security theater.\nWould you really want to have blogger Bob's job? He is gets thrashed and has to answer questions over and over again.\"\nThe job opening (Program Analyst for Public Affairs)was made public on USA Jobs. I applied for it. I submitted my resume, 8 lovely KSAs and I interviewed. I got the job.\nJanuary 9, 2009 4:08 PM\"\nWow! Finally an answer. Thank you Bob. Unfortunately, I posed this very question the day the blog was launced and several times since and this is the first time an answer was posted. With a time frame like that to answer a simple question, it's no wonder there is so much animosity on this site.\n\"People its a zipper on your bag. A ZIPPER! No kind of lock is preventing access to your bag. It is but a mere zipper. So your locked zipper tabs are on one side of that bag and you use a tool to pop the zipper open on the other side. Oh my the bag is open and you can close it by moving both zippers back around to the side you popped the zipper open. Try it out it can make you feel like a lockpicker. The point I am making is your bag is not secure unless TSA did something like the strapping idea I have seen.(Costs to much)\"\n\"Anonymous its a high-security equipment case. HIGH SECURITY! A hermetic seal and good lock are preventing access to my stuff.\"\nNot everyone's luggage is a cloth bag with a zipper, mine is an air tight shipping case that is locked solid.\n\"And as to my post about the zipper bags. The majority of bags have zippers. Some luggage is more secure, hard-sided, pelican cases. I am speaking of more common luggage.\"\nSince we can not secure our bags, zippers are fine. When...

I am not buying it.\nI am pretty sure that terrorists know your procedures. Not much is secret.\nYa Phil, why dont you tell the president that you need his office for a slumber party. I mean you're his boss and all... I think the fumes from all your dirty dishes stacking on your desk is starting to rot your brain.\nI think what Phil means is that the TSA works for the people. You, the TSA, are here to serve the public. In a sense you work for the public but we, the public, are not your employer.\nIn response to Phils statement.\n\"I want to know what -- besides simply being in compliance with laws as we do anywhere -- we need to do in order to avoid having our freedom of motion restricted by TSA at their checkpoints.\"\nI want to know what -- besides simply being in compliance with laws as we do anywhere -- we need to do at a TSA checkpoint in order to avoid having our freedom of motion restricted by TSA there."
