By serving as both a laptop and tablet, a 2-in-1 can take the place of both, reducing the amount of capital spent on supplying the company workforce with the devices they\u2019ll need. Add in a dock for work in the office, and you\u2019ve got a device that can also serve as a workstation and thereby be fill every need your employees might have.\nIf you\u2019re concerned that a 2-in-1 device won\u2019t have as much computing power behind it as a typical laptop does, don\u2019t be. Plus, Windows 10 was designed specifically with 2-in-1 devices in mind, so transitioning from laptop mode to tablet mode and back is fairly seamless, and you have the ability to simultaneously run multiple applications.\nWhile most 2-in-1 devices won\u2019t be capable of running the type of programs that video editors or graphic designers will need, there are some that can. These options sometimes even include a built-in stylus to make such activities more hands-on.\nSpeaking of hands-on, these devices allow the user to use them in the way that feels more natural. So, if a user prefers to use the touchscreen, they can, while others can use a mouse. Another benefit of the touchscreen is the fact that users are more and more likely to be accustomed to using touchscreens in the rest of their life, and incorporating it into a work device can increase productivity through familiarity.\nThis is perhaps one of the most visible benefits of utilizing a 2-in-1 device. No matter what you have to do, the chances are good that your device can handle it efficiently. Switching between laptop and tablet modes gives you a dual-purpose interface. In a matter of moments, you can work on a project and then present it to your peers before submitting it to management. That ease-of-use is not inherent in any other type of device.\nSo, what do you think? Would a 2-in-1 solution be useful in your company\u2019s day-to-day activities?
