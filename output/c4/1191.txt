    "text": "After competing many times, local artist Ann Iungerich and her husband, David, decided to share some lessons learned Saturday in an ice-sculpting workshop.\nThe concept was more sculptors might make for a better competition.\n\"We've done a lot of research and tried to figure out what's what. That was why we decided to have a workshop - what few little secrets we know, we're willing to share that with others,\" Ann explained.\nAnn and David Iungerich taught the half dozen participants how to chop away at the ice, just using wood chisels.\n\"Over the years, we've learned that just wood chisels work the best for us,\" Ann said. \"We don't bring any power tools. We just have different various sharp chisels and that's what we use.\"\nThere's typically six to eight teams each year, and the Iungerichs are hoping this workshop will expand involvement and break down the barrier for people who may be interested in competing themselves.\nAlthough she is an artist in many other mediums herself, Ann says she had never sculpted ice before her first year. After a friend suggested she try it, Ann said, \"Sure!\"\n\"I'm always up for a new adventure,\" Ann said.\nBut even as an artist herself, she said it was a little scary to start.\n\"It was a little bit intimidating, because we didn't know exactly how to do what we were doing, and yet it was exhilarating to watch, to take the blocks from nothing,\" she said.\nAnn says she competed that first year with her husband and her son. David said he was skeptical at first.\n\"I initially said no. She talked me into it, 'cause I had no clue, I'm not very artsy,\" he said. \"After that, we got hooked. It's a blast.\"\nAlex Vance, a fan of Iungerich's, decided to come to the workshop because she loves her work.\n\"I'm an Ann Iungerich fan, so I follow her,\" Vance said. \"Then she said: 'Here! Try it!' And now my hands are cold and I don't know what i'm doing. But it's fun!\"\nFor those intimidated by the ice and the chisel, Ann Iungerich has some advice: \"Sometimes I feel like we let fear rule our lives. Just jump in and try it. What's the worst that could happen? You could fail! Big deal, so what. It's just for fun. Just be part of a team and enjoy it.\"\nFor those who could not attend, a Facebook live of the event was filmed and Iungerich said they may upload it to YouTube. Iungerich also advised: \"Google ice sculpting or search YouTube and look at videos, how other people do it.\"\nFor her and her now-skilled family of ice sculptors, \"we just kind of, by trial-and-error, figured something out,\" she explained.\nThe Media Logic Radio's Ice Sculpting Competition will take place from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. in downtown Fort Morgan. Iungerich said they usually provide the theme several days in advance, and encouraged anyone interested to get involved."
