    "text": "This radio is in good condition, it comes with the original box and accessories, and transmits out of band. The radio appears to have been lightly used.\nThis radio comes with the MH-34 hand mic, programming software, drop in charger, and an SD card reader.\nThe most attractive benefit of digital communication is its ability to transfer large amounts of data. The new FT1DR uses 12.5 kHz C4FM FDMA digital modulation mode to enable high speed data communication capability, reliable voice communication with strong error correction performance. C4FM FDMA provides 9.6 kbps data baud rate speed. It is significantly different from existing digital Amateur Radio and expands the opportunities for Amateur radio operators activities in the future.\n\u00b7 V/D mode is Voice and Data communication in the same time frame. This mode enables the transceiver to send voice data with GPS position data and ID data in the same time frame. Also, this mode can pass the voice data with strong error correction data to stabilize the digital communication. This mode will be the basic mode of C4FM FDMA Digital HAM radio.\n\u00b7 Data FR mode uses the full rate of data capacity for transfering data. This mode enables you to transfer large amounts of data, text messages, images, and voice memo data with double speed in V/D mode.\n\u00b7 Voice FR mode uses the full rate of data capacity for voice data. This mode enables you to transfer clear, high quality voice data.\n\u00b7 Analog FM mode is the same as current FM mode allowing you to communicate with all VHF/UHF HAM radio operators.\nThe new FT1DR has very useful Automatic Mode Select function to identify and automatically select these four modes and when the radio receives a signal.\nYou can depend on up to 5 watts of reliable power output. There are four steps of power output, 5 watts, 2.5 watts, 1 watt and 0.1 watt. There are two types of Li-Ion battery. The optional FNB-102LI battery will provide up to 8 hours of typical 5 watt operation.\nWith two independent receivers, you may listen to either the same or a different band simultaneously.\nListen to AM or FM radio stations while monitoring two frequency channels! Two independent receivers will allow you to listen to your favorite AM or FM broadcast station, and monitor two different bands (\u201cBand A\u201d and \u201cBand B\u201d) at the same time.\nThe FT1DR operates in one traditional analog mode and three digital modes! Enjoy communication in the mode that best suits your needs. purpose.\nHalf of the bandwidth is used for voice signal with error correction. The transceiver uses powerful error correction technology developed for professional communication devices. The very effective error correction code provides benefits such as minimal interruption of communication. The basic digital C4FM FDMA mode provides a good balance between sound quality and error correction.\nThis mode uses the entire 12.5 kHz bandwidth to transmit digital voice data. The larger voice data size allows voice communication with high sound quality. Use this mode for pleasing sound quality communication between amateur radio friends.\nA high-speed data communication mode that uses the entire 12.5 kHz bandwidth for data communication. The transceiver automatically switches to this mode when sending and receiving images, allowing a large amount of data to be transmitted quickly.\nAnalog FM is effective for communication with a weak signal that causes voices to break up in the digital modes. The analog mode allows communication even at distances where noise and weak signals make communication almost impossible. The tried-and-trusted low-power circuit design uses less battery power than the digital modes.\nThe transceiver automatically selects one of the four communication modes according to the signal received. This is extremely convenient when listening for communications, as you do not need to be aware of the other party\u2019s communication mode. The transceiver can also be operated in a fixed communication mode.\nWhen using the handy speaker microphone camera (optional MH-85A11U), press the shutter button to capture a snapshot, then press the image transmit button to easily transmit the image data.\nThe snapshot image or received data is stored in a high capacity micro SD card that is installed in the radio. You can recall and send that image data from the SD card anytime. The image data size is 320 x 240 dots or 160 x 120 dots. Image quality can set from 3 types, and you can choose a format that is suitable for the image and purpose.\nThis image data also retains a time record and the GPS location data of the snapshot. It is easy to view and edit the data file after taking the pictures by using a personal computer.\nA snapshot aids in navigating and returning to the pictured location; other various uses are possible.\nThe digital GM function automatically checks whether members registered in a group are within communication range, and displays information such as distance and direction for each call sign on the screen. This convenient function makes it possible not only to see whether any friends are in communication range, but also to instantaneously determines the location and relationship between all members of the group.\nThis function can also be used to send messages and data such as images between members of a group, permitting convenient and fun communication between friends when out for a drive or hike. Sent and received messages and images can be checked on the LOG List screen, with icons making them easy to distinguish.\nThe FT1DR includes a high resolution band-scope with about 50 channels.\nCovers 504 kHz - 999.900 MHz (A Band), 108 MHz - 580 MHz (B Band), continuous reception for short-wave, FM/AM broadcasts, aircraft, public service channels, etc.\nPreset Receiver Function with an Extensive Range of Major Broadcasting Stations and Various Wireless Information Services. The FT1DR has a preset receiver function with various frequencies in memories, making it easy to call up stations in the various communication services. The frequencies include short-wave broadcasts, international (marine) VHF and NOAA Weather channels.\nIntegral GPS receiver and antenna (located on top of the radio) provides location, time, direction and APRS\u00ae information. The FT1DR has a very useful GPS data transmission capability.\nThe built-in worldwide standard AX.25 Data TNC Modem permits uncomplicated APRS\u00ae (Automatic Packet Reporting System) operation. You will be able to display the information, station list; and use the message, SmartBeaconing TM function . You will be able to track your APRS\u00ae movement on the Internet websites.\nThis is a real-time navigation function that records the location and direction of Group Monitor (GM) stations. Digital V/D Mode communicates information such as position data at the same time as the voice signal, allowing you to view the distance and direction of the other party in real time while communicating. This makes it possible to confirm your position and the other party\u2019s in situations such as hiking and driving where your positions are constantly changing, providing an easy way to meet up or join routes.\nThe FT1DR includes 1266 channel memories; 24 100-channel memory banks; memory TAG up to 16 characters.\nWe were sure to include versatile scanning capablities for the monitoring enthusiasts!\nBuilt-in CTCSS, DCS and an all new PAGER fution encode/decode enables multiple-use selective calling features.\nA micro SD card slot is provided on the side of the radio. Memory back-up, the picture image data and other useful information is stored on the high capacity micro SD card (Maximum 32GB). The GPS logger records the location and track information of your moving station, which may be shown later by using Map software on your personal computer, By using the SD card, it is also possible to clone the radio data to the other compatible radios.\nThe FT1DR GPS receiver is used to provide a highly accurate 24 hour Clock for your various needs.\nPassword Lock function to meet you security concerns.\n- Built-in sensor provides accurate temperature readings."
