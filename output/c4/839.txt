    "text": "OK folks so it\u2019s Chinese New Year and the pig has chased off the chicken and now rules the roost.\nApparently anyone who is born in the year of the pig is studious and gallant, has tremendous inner strength, will not hesitate to strive for their goals, is quiet but well informed, kind, affectionate and loyal for life. Long story short, in China, being a pig is actually pretty darned cool.\nHere at Mandarin Film, our annual Chinese New Year tradition is to share the ten most mind-blowing locations that we have had the pleasure of filming at this year. If you\u2019re curious about filming in China or partnering with us on a project, please feel free to reach out!\nYes, floating solar farms are a thing, and of course, in China they are the biggest and the best.\nThe vast fields of panels that sit atop the Yangtze river are known as the largest floating solar project in the world. Having said this, given the brisk pace China is building more renewable projects, it\u2019s unlikely to hold that title for very long.\nThe floating power plant will produce enough energy to power 15,000 homes. Building on bodies of water, especially manmade lakes that are not ecologically sensitive, helps protect agricultural land and terrestrial ecosystems from being developed for destructive energy use. The water also cools the electronics in the solar panels, helping them to work more efficiently.\nThe panels featured in Our Planet, a film for Netflix by Silverback Films in association with WWF. See the Trailer here.\nCar shoots in Shanghai are pretty standard, but our client Final Frame in Germany wanted to make this one stand out \u2013 so we bridged that valley to get extra super-duper cool locations for the Hella shoot. Nanpu Bridge is as rad as bridges get in Shanghai \u2013 and of course you need to shoot it with a drone to get the full effect. This video recently won gold at the New York Festival TV and Film Awards. See our number one location slot below for Britain\u2019s schoolboy answer to Nanpu Bridge.\nThe Beijing Swift is so famous it is the emblem of Beijing\u2019s foremost beer. The swift nests in some of the city\u2019s most spectacular locations \u2013 including the Summer Palace and Zhengyang Gate at Tiananmen Square, presenting tricky access challenges for the filming crew. In this film we worked with the BBC to overcome access obstacles and film these amazing birds that fly 30,000 kilometers a year and rarely touch the ground.\nWild Metropolis is a new landmark three part wildlife series made for the BBC with co-producers Tencent (China) and PBS (US).\nYes \u2013 virtual locations are still locations! In this case, shooting Genghis Khan battlefield plates and short scenes on the Mongolian Steppe for a huge computer game franchise.\nThis was our producer Shan Shan\u2019s favorite ever shoot \u2013 even though it was foggy every day and the whole shoot needed to be squeezed into the few hours on the final day when the fog finally lifted. Phew!\nIn early 2018 US news site Upworthy, http://www.upworthy.com commissioned Mandarin Film to produce a short video as part of a global series about long term change-makers, entitled \u2018the Long Game\u2019.\nWe arranged at Heqing, Yunnan Province in China\u2019s far South-West corner, to film TNC\u2019s work around Plateau Wetland and Bird Habitat Conservation. We were blown away by what we witnessed. Amongst the rapid development of the area what we found was a quiet, clean heaven for birds of every stripe, and a paradise for bird watchers and nature-lovers.\nFood is a national obsession in China, and food junkies will go to any extremes to get their gastronomic fix.\nFood Unwrapped is a long-running popular Channel 4 TV show that travels the world exploring the industry secrets behind our favourite foods.\nHighlights of the shoot included capturing Matt Tebutt opening a freshly fished clam to discover dozens of pearls inside, Jimmy Doherty making traditional soy sauce at a picturesque riverside with 3000 pots of fermenting soy beans and, the star of the show \u2013 a five year old boy showing our host how to forage bamboo shoots on the wild film set of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.\nFrom JiayuGuan \u2013 The Great Wall\u2019s westernmost watchtower in the desert, to the tropical lush waterfalls of Detian, these were some of the most challenging shoot locations in all of China. The journey led our multiple camera crews from the furthermost border of Horgos in north-west of China, to Pingxiang at the China-Vietnam border in the south west, Mandarin Film took these teams across half of China to make this challenging show happen.\nThe beautiful karst landscapes of south west China make a dramatic backdrop to the death defying free solo climbs of the langurs troupes. Move over Alex Honnold - Langurs, some as young as six months old, make these daily climbs from the forest floor to their citadels on the cliff tops.\nMandarin Film is co-producing a new one hour wildlife documentary with Earth Touch for CCTV9, Smithsonian and ORF. This 4K documentary will showcase these critically endangered langurs in their breathtaking karst homeland of Guangxi. Already in production, watch out for these cliff-climbing primates with white mohicans and bright orange babies in summer 2020!\nMandarin Film is producing a new TV and interactive webseries following travel adventurer Ash Dykes on his mission to be the first person to walk the entire length of the Yangtze River. The show is provisionally entitled Walking the Yangtze: Into the Heart of China.\nClick here to see estimated timelines for when Ash is expecting to pass through the different stages of the journey and follow him in real time on the Live Tracker to see if he is on target to set a new world record..\nFrom in-car saunas to goose-intestine hot pot, million-dollar luxury cars to three-wheeler stunts, the China episode of Amazon Prime\u2019s \u2018The Grand Tour\u2019 is a sight to behold.\nThe show was Amazon Video\u2019s most watched premiere episode, and although no viewing figures are available\uff0cit is generally regarded as one of the most watched TV shows in the world, even surpassing Game of Thrones in terms of \u2018most illegally downloaded show\u2019!\nThe shoot took place in several provinces in South China, and included scenes of the presenters exploring China, driving some amazing roads and performing dare-devil stunts. One of the many challenges of the shoot was to get temporary driving licenses for the cast and crew. Something that had never been permitted before. We filmed a million dollar car, and gained support from different local government bodies allowing the crew to film on the jaw-dropping highway and bridge constructions of China\u2019s stunning southern mountain areas.\nWatch out for the schoolboy bridge scene\u2026.\nThe Grand Tour is a British motoring television series for Amazon Video, presented by Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond, and James May.\nThe show was Amazon Video\u2019s most watched premiere episode, and although no viewing figures are available is generally regarded as one of the most watched TV shows in the world, even surpassing Game of Thrones in terms of \u2018most illegally downloaded show\u2019!\nMandarin Film worked with UK-based production company Chump Productions to create and shoot an episode on China for the third season of the series. A Mandarin Film team of producers helped source stories and characters and then worked on the laborious task of getting China-wide permissions for importing cars, obtaining driving licenses and getting permits for a crew of more than 80, with over fifteen vehicles for a two week shoot.\nThe shoot took place in several provinces in South China, and included scenes of the presenters exploring China, driving some amazing roads and performing dare-devil stunts.

The shoot was a huge success and will be aired in early 2019.\n\u201cIn winter, swifts hibernate all the way to Africa. And in Spring, they fly all the way back to Beijing and to this exact building where they had built their nest before. This means flying over 30,000 kilometers a year. No matter how harsh the journey, nothing can waver their will of coming back home. \u201d said Professor Gao Wu while holding a baby swift tenderly in his hand, during his recent swift ringing event once a year at the Summer Palace. Wild Metropolis covered this year\u2019s swift ringing event, as part of the Beijing Swift story.\nWild Metropolisis a new landmark three part wildlife series made for the BBC with co-producers Tencent (China) and PBS (US). Mandarin Filmhelped with all aspects of the production to film the Beijing Swifts, at various swift habitats around the city.\nThe series will reveal the world\u2019s most extraordinary wildlife living in the newest and fastest changing habitat on the planet \u2013 human cities. Filmed across the world, the series aims to experience the most-loved and familiar cities through fresh eyes\u2026 the eyes of the animals that live in them. The story filmed in Beijing focuses on the Beijing Swift, which has been associated with the city for hundreds of years, nesting in some of the city\u2019s most spectacular locations \u2013 including the Summer Palace and Zhengyang Gate at Tiananmen Square.\nKey challenges for the production were obtaining the permissions to access some of the most closely guarded national cultural relics like Tiananmen Square and the Summer Palace, and moreover, to film wildlife\u2019s living habitat in a busy city like Beijing.\n\u201cAs a city resident, we rarely look into the sky of Beijing or ancient architecture, and pay attention to observe the birds this long. The Beijing Swift fly extremely fast and in various patterns. Unlike filming in the wild, to film animals in the city we need take people and traffic into consideration. The nests are often high and inaccessible. With a bit of problem-solving, coordination with key locations and NGOs and a lot of patience, we managed to get some amazing shots which perfectly embody the co-existence of human and animal. I can\u2019t wait to see the final film!\u201d Shan-Shan Wang, \u2013 Mandarin Film Producer.\n\u201c I just wanted to say thanks again for all your hard work during our shoot in Beijing \u2013 everything went so smoothly and I know was down to your hard work behind the scenes. \u201d\u2013 Director/Researcher, BBC Wild Metropolis.\nWorking closely with CARFTE (The Chinese Association for Radio, Film and Television Exchange), Mandarin Filmwas able to obtain permissions for all of the filming sites and appropriate visas for the foreign crew.\nWild Metropolisis now in post-production stage, and will be released in 2019 on BBC, Tencent and PBS.\nFrom tins of bamboo shoots and cloves of garlic to noodles and tea, in this food unwrapped China special Ricochet wanted to explore the origins of China\u2019s amazing foods.\nFood safety can be a sensitive subject in China so we had to navigate those sensitivities whilst dealing with complicated visas and permitting, always with an eye on researching great stories that would chime with a UK audience. Without giving too much away we found some incredibly entertaining and yet informative stories across China, filming simultaneously with two separate crews in 8 different cities across Beijing, Sichuan, Yunnan, Jiangxi, and Jiangsu Provinces over 10 days.\nHighlights of the shoot included capturing Matt Tebutt opening a freshly fished clam to discover dozens of pearls inside. Other great moments were host Jimmy Doherty making traditional soy sauce at a picturesque riverside with 3000 pots of fermenting soy beans and later foraging bamboo shoots on the film set of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.\nMandarin Film provided full production services from research, location scouting, logistics and official permissions, to crew, equipment and production staff on the shoots."
