    "text": "It\u2019s always nice to learn of new, fresh talent in the area; this month a young up-and-coming musical talent from East Providence is about to blossom more fully. James Collington, along with his singing partner Jess Shoe, form the band Collington. On Saturday, April 7, the duo will be at Riverside\u2019s Providence Coffee Roasters to release their first full-length CD, Feet on the Ground.\nTwenty one-year-old Collington is the lead singer and songwriter for the band and says he has performed as an entertainer for about two years. However, the East Providence native actually started performing at the age of 16 at his church.\nCollington and Shoe have been performing together for five years. Collington sings lead, plays the guitar (and when performing live) also plays the kick drum. Shoe sings backup, plays the piano and serves as a sounding board for Collington\u2019s music. He explains, \u201cIt\u2019s interesting. Sometimes I hear the potential in the songs and she may not like them, or a part of them. Getting an eh or a thumbs down usually pushes me to try harder. But, for the most part, if I like something I stick with it.\u201d Many of his songs are inspired by the tribulations of life and by his faith; he is often asked to perform at churches. However, he prefers to play at bars and clubs so as to reach a wider audience.\nJudging from the samples of music on the band\u2019s Facebook page, the band is bound to do well. The sound is a blend of acoustic folk and soft rock. Collington\u2019s voice is smooth and clear, and Shoe blends well in the background. The music and easily understood lyrics should appeal to both young and old alike. Currently, the band\u2019s Facebook page has close to 670 fans.\nIn addition to the CD, there is also a music video in the works; it will be produced by CC Productions with the help of another East Providence native, Chris Costa. The CD cover artwork is by Lauren Olsen, a senior at Barrington High School. This is definitely a homegrown project featuring lots of local talent in many arenas.\nFor more information about Collington and their new CD Feet on the Ground or to hear a sampling of their music, visit the band\u2019s Facebook page.
