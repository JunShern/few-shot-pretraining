    "text": "The best answers to your carpet related questions are found in the FAQs below.\nWhich is better: dry carpet cleaning or steam cleaning?\nAny provider of Carpet Cleaning Redwood City will quickly tell you that neither is better than the other. Each carpet cleaning method has its intended purpose. Dry carpet cleaning is preferable for quick cleaning needs that don't involve tough stains and smells. It is also great for delicate carpets that tend to change color when exposed to hot water or chemicals. Steam cleaning, on the other hand, is for more thorough carpet cleaning. However, it takes longer to finish and also requires some drying time.\nCan you wash only some parts of a carpet?\nThere is no rule that demands carpet cleaning to be something that needs to be done in full all the time. You can always have the choice to clean only parts of your carpet that look dirtier compared to the rest. There is no need to deep clean all the carpets in the house when only one part shows visible tough-to-remove stains. Also, it is possible to steam clean some parts while dry cleaning the rest.\nHow can I protect my carpet from getting dirty?\nThe easiest way is to place mats in front of all exterior doors. Choose mats that help to brush off dust and dirt and that blot water and chemicals such as ice-melting salts. You should also encourage your family members and visitors to take their shoes off before they enter the house. You may also want to limit eating and drinking in rooms with carpets.\nCarpet cleaning can be done without professional help, but it is a little risky. It takes skill and experience to effectively clean a carpet without risking damaging it. Soap and water can be devastating for some rugs, especially Persian carpets. So if you are not sure of what you're doing, it's better to seek professional assistance."
