    "text": "The richest athlete in the history of women\u2019s sport was suspended last year for failing a drug test putting her lucrative tennis career on the line.\nMaria Sharapova recently returned to play after serving a 15-month suspension for using the banned substance meldonium. Meldonium was banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) just a few months prior to Sharapova\u2019s positive test. The drug was banned after finding that the drug could potentially increase exercise capacity and tolerance.\nHow is the sport affected?\nWhat to make of all this? Well, you can be sure that people in the future will use the \u201cdidn\u2019t know\u201d or \u201cdidn\u2019t hear\u201d defense when found taking a banned substance, whether the argument is legitimate or not. To guard against such defenses, governing bodies may need to broadcast any list changes more clearly on multiple channels. They may need to make clearer some common alternative names for a banned substance (within reason, of course, since drugs may have many, many different names).\nKnow what\u2019s in your body.\nAt the same time, athletes need to be careful about and keep track of what goes into their bodies. Asking the International Tennis Federation (ITF) to monitor what each player on the Women\u2019s Tennis Association (WTA) tour is taking and then give her a gentle warning about anything possibly suspicious or banned is just not realistic. The WTA includes hundreds of players across numerous countries. Following each closely would be logistically challenging.\nYour doctor doesn\u2019t even know what you are taking unless you tell him or her. This is especially true for patients taking supplements or other substances offered by alternative health providers that don\u2019t follow Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines. Such items may have ingredients and substances that could affect your health without your realizing it.\nYou could be end up regretting not fully knowing or understanding what is going into your body."
