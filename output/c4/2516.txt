The term can also be used to emphasize the length of full-day programs as opposed to after-school programs, as in Jewish day school.\nThe term one-day school may be used for a one-off series of lectures or classes, taking place on a single day, usually on a particular topic and usually directed at adult learners with little time to spare.\n^ \"Day school definition, a school open for instruction on weekdays only, usually from 9 a.m. until 3 p.m. \"Day school - dictionary.com\".\n^ \"Founded in 1969.
