PROXIES!!!\nThis is a document of both mastersets and waves 1-3 and some of 4 now waves 1-12!. The rest will be put on the other pages that will be uploaded at another time.\nThe image above is the first page. Just get some pieces to put them on(I recommend 1.5 x 1.5 wooden circles you can buy in huge amounts cheap) and boom you have a bunch of fancy new proxies to last. To print make sure the size of it printing is original full size of 11 by 8.5 or IT WILL NOT COME OUT RIGHT! so I suggest you don't use google chrome. I am in no ways responsible for ill used ink. Thanks for the time and hope you enjoy my little project.\nTHE ATHLETIC FATTY COMMANDS YOU!\nLast edited by darkchaos452366; April 22nd, 2013 at 08:58 PM.\nOne suggestion is to put commons on a separate page as people will want to print multiple copies of these but only one of the uniques.\nYes I plan on doing that once I get all the waves done I will start doing commons on other pages."
