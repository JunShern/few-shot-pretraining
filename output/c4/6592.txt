    "text": "At more than a billion dollars, the mobile-food industry is enjoying more publicity and notoriety than ever before. Catering to a new generation of foodies looking for quick and unique specialties, the mobile-food business is booming with new opportunities for eager entrepreneurs like you. From gourmet food to all-American basics and hot dog wagons to bustaurants, our experts give you the delicious details behind starting and running a successful mobile-food business.\nJohn Harvey Kellogg was one of America's most beloved physicians; a best-selling author, lecturer, and health-magazine publisher; founder of the Battle Creek Sanitarium; and patron saint of the pursuit of wellness. His youngest brother, Will, was the founder of the Battle Creek Toasted Corn Flake Company. In The Kelloggs, Howard Markel tells the sweeping saga of these two extraordinary men, whose lifelong competition and enmity toward one another changed America's notion of health and wellness and who helped change the course of American medicine, nutrition, wellness, and diet.\nFrom the cofounders of the smash hit Cousins Maine Lobster food trucks comes a business book revealing to new entrepreneurs how the authors built their brand through integrity and authenticity.\nIn early 2012, Jim Tselikis visited LA and met up with his cousin Sabin Lomac. Over a few drinks they waxed nostalgic about their childhood in Maine, surrounded by family, often elbow deep in delicious lobster while gathered around the picnic table. From this strong memory was born the very first Cousins Maine Lobster food truck. Smart, authentic marketing, and sustainable, delicious ingredients helped turn that one food truck into an overnight sensation. Then, in just three years, they went from a single food truck to a nationally franchised legion of trucks, an online delivery service, and a brick-and-mortar restaurant, grossing over $15 million in sales a year.\nStart-up fever has taken hold of America, and there are hundreds of books to teach listeners how to become entrepreneurs; this is the first book to answer the question: What's next? At each step, Jim and Sabin were faced with hard decisions - opening each new food truck carefully instead of rushing to meet the demand; turning down a six-figure franchise offer because it came from someone who didn't support their vision; turning down Shark Tank (twice) until they could insist on participating only if Barbara Corcoran was one of the Sharks. Now Jim and Sabin teach listeners how they, too, can reach the next level of success in their own businesses, without having to compromise themselves.\n\u00a92018 James Tselikis, Sabin Lomac, and Barbara Corcoran (foreword) (P)2018 Audible, Inc.\nAwesome book! I highly recommend it to any entrepreneur looking for authentic advice. These guys are straight shooters and don't sugar coat things. They make it clear that it isn't easy to build a brand and it's not for everyone. They have a ton of hilarious stories like having to ask \"what's a P & L\". I live in South Dakota but this book makes me want to travel out to LA to try their food and meet these guys. They seem like guys you would want to have a beer with. I can't say enough positive things about this book!"
