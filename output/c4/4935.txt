    "text": "Are you fully prepared for the cabin crew recruitment process? At most airline\u2019s, long gone are the days where you could simply turn up at an Open Day and hope the recruiter liked the look of you. Nowadays, you have to submit a detailed online application including a bespoke resume or CV to stand a chance.\nBut it\u2019s not just your initial application that you\u2019ll need to have prepared in advance. Are you also ready to face the cabin crew entry tests? As part of the application process, you\u2019ll also be expected to complete a series of online exams \u2013 and if you don\u2019t score high enough, your application will be automatically disqualified.\nThe process is familiar at leading airline\u2019s around the world. From North America to Europe, Asia to Australasia \u2013 recruiters are adding this extra step into the recruitment process everywhere. It\u2019s even happening at airline\u2019s that you might not expect \u2013 Emirates will be introducing a new series of tests when they restart cabin crew recruitment later this year.\nLuckily, we\u2019ve sat through many of these online cabin crew exams and know exactly what international airlines are testing candidates on. With that knowledge, we\u2019ve created a series of bespoke practice tests to help you prepare for the cabin crew application tests. And the best bit? \u2013 they\u2019re completely free!\nFor the time being, we\u2019ve focused on two practice English language tests and two reading and comprehension tests \u2013 the most popular ones you\u2019ll be faced with. These mimic the exact tests you\u2019ll be faced with, in order to prepare you as best as possible.\nWe\u2019ve developed two practice English fluency tests that based on what leading international airlines use during their cabin crew recruitment process. This style of test is used at major Middle East carriers, including Emirates, Etihad, Qatar Airways and flydubai. You\u2019ll also find this style of test used at airlines such as Singapore Airlines and a number of European airlines.\nFor some airlines, even if you\u2019re not expected to do one of these tests at the application stage, you\u2019ll still need to complete it at an Assessment Day \u2013 such as Etihad or Qatar Airways.\nHow good is your memory? And for that matter, how good are you at paying attention? That\u2019s what this test is all about \u2013 making sure you can take in valuable information and then be able to recall it when needed. This is vital, not only for getting through the tough cabin crew training course but also for dealing with incidents on board an aircraft.\nThis is an incredibly popular test and is used to see whether you can cope under pressure. With only a short amount of time, you need to work quickly but accurately \u2013 making sure you\u2019ve got the right information to answer the question correctly.\nA very good point Alana! We\u2019re actually working on some numerical tests at the moment \u2013 and as before, they are very closely based on real tests used by airlines. Watch this space!"
