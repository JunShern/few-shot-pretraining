To commemorate this occasion, a community empowerment event, co-sponsored by Metro Human Relations Commission and Vanderbilt HIV Vaccine Program, will be held at Ray of Hope Community Church in East Nashville on Sunday, February 7, 2016 at 9am. This awareness event, led by renowned pastors Rev. Martin L. Espinosa and Rev. Dr. Renita J. Weems, is designed to help remove the stigma of HIV and AIDS in the African American community by providing the most recent science, research and information on health services in Nashville. Free, private, on-site HIV testing will also be available by Streetworks.\nDynamic speakers living and thriving with HIV/AIDS will share their personal journeys. One of the speakers, Bruce A. Johnson, Jr, is an HIV+ member of the Ray of Hope congregation and former TSU student leader who learned about his status after organizing a testing event for the University.\nLawayne Childrey, an author, journalist, motivational speaker, and Edward R. Murrow Award recipient for exceptional journalism, will also discuss his journey growing up as young, black and gay in the South and navigating life\u2019s challenges as a man infected with HIV.
