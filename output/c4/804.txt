    "text": "We finally have the visuals for the very funky collaboration between Swindle and one of my favorites, Daley. This video has so much life within it, the colors just accent the track so much more. The track overall is a feel good track, and the video gives off some seriously feel good vibes too.\nSide note, it\u2019s damn good to see Daley back on the screen!\nWe all know my support for Daley, so this post is to just show more of it! By the way, if you haven\u2019t bought his album Days & Nights, go do so now!\nAlso I\u2019m in this video, so there is that.\nThis track isn\u2019t the newest, but seeing as I have been supporting Daley since the beginning, I need to have a post for this Pharrell produced track titled \u2018Look Up\u2019. \u2018Look Up\u2019 followed his UK release titled \u2018Broken\u2018.\n\u2018Look Up\u2019 has all the right necessities for a feel good song, and can I just say that Daley working with Pharrell is a huge step, and I\u2019m so glad all of this happening. Like I said, it is an all around feel good track, there is nothing negative that can be said with a Daley track. I can\u2019t stress how much you need to purchase this song, go do it!\nLook out for Daley in a city near you if you live in the USA!\nI apologize for taking so long posting this, I definitely have not forgot about it. Daley, who remains one of my favorites since I found him, has graced us with a video for his smash tune titled \u2018Broken\u2019. \u2018Broken\u2019 to sum it all up is pretty much the male break up anthem and it is perfect in every way. Daley\u2019s vocals have never sounded better, and with each track he puts out from his Days & Nights album gets me more and more excited for the release of it.\nMore recently he has put out a track with rapper Nelly called \u2018Heaven\u2018, which he performed in NYC over the weekend on Good Morning America, hopefully giving him the acknowledgement that he deserves.\nHere\u2019s to \u2018Heaven\u2019 gaining some success over here, and here\u2019s to Daley giving us a USA tour before that success hits!\nThose of you who have been following this blog know that I am a huge supporter of semi-newcomer Daley. I have been following his career for quite some time now, and he is slowly getting the credit he deserves with his success of \u2018Alone Together\u2019 all over the USA. He has been teasing us with this video for a couple of days now, and it is finally out in full and just like anything he puts out, it doesn\u2019t disappoint at all. STRMOY is perfection, and I\u2019m very much excited to hear his next EP, and soon followed by his album Days & Nights.\nStay tuned friends, this guy is about to blow up!\nThe ever so amazing Daley, releases a short EP, that brings back some of his previously amazing songs from the Those Who Wait mixtape, but also features 3 new songs! \u2018Blame The World\u2019 is among one of them, which is not necessarily new since it\u2019s been out in acoustic form for quite some time, but the studio quality is just amazing. The string features are just amazing, and of course nothing bad can ever be said about Daley\u2019s soulful vocals.\nI\u2019ve already bought it, as should you! It\u2019s available on itunes in the US, and if you are hesitating on buying it because there isn\u2019t enough new material for you, well I beg to differ! The 3 extra songs you get, are more than worth the money you pay for the whole thing!\nNow get lost in \u2018Blame The World\u2019 below!"
