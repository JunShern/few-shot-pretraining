The student executes the following nine steps, which are those recommended under the conditions in the title. Under mild conditions, please try to imagine waves over three feet and rain in the face like shotgun pellets.\nSail to upwind Junior line.\nBefore launching in exciting conditions, it is wise to carry a radio and to notify the Day Leader they may be needed.\nWhen deploying the anchor, the rode must go out the front of the boat (to keep the bow pointed into the wind) or this maneuver will not work.\nBefore the drill capsize, please get at least 90% of the way from the rocks to the upwind line. If you capsize too much before you get there, try sailing main only.\nIt is hard to point very high sailing jib only, and nearly impossible to tack, so to go upwind you need to jibe quickly so as not to lose much ground during the turn. Use this opportunity to practice pointing as high as possible and making quick jibes. Make sure centerboard is fully down, and do not oversheet as this would make it hard to point very high.\nIf you have an unconscious sailor, particularly one with a head injury, contact the Coast Guard immediately on channel 16.\nIf you need help but can\u2019t reach the Dayleader on 69 (might happen if you\u2019re north of the Berkeley Pier), you might try contacting the Berkeley Marina harbormaster on 68 and asking her to pass a message to the DL.\nIn an incident in the first half of 2017, on a Thursday race night most of the club\u2019s best sailors were confronted with 40-knot winds. All boats capsized. Most were unable to right their boats even with mainsails down. Only two crews were able to survive with any grace.\nThe first set of survivors, both highly-skilled sailors, were able to perform the above-listed steps and sail back in jib only, but it was very hard, they reported. Pulling up the anchor, in the teeth of very high waves and winds, was exhausting.\nThe second set of survivors simply set their anchor and swam back to the dock, recovering their boat the next day."
