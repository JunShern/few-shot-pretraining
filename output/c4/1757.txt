Dogs are always welcome at outdoor tables.\nBarking Dog has received a rating of 5.0 out of 5 bones by 5 dog owners on BringFido and 3.5 out of 5 in 84 traveler reviews on TripAdvisor.\nFrequent out of town visitors to the city and ended up right back here for our second visit after a morning in Central Park with our two dogs.\nAnd most likely going to stick with it.\nPlentiful outdoor seating under canopy.\nGreat bloody Mary's and numerous creative drinks on menu.\nHave thoroughly enjoyed all menu orders thus far. Don't be afraid to try some creative breakfast offerings.\nI found the potato pesto pancakes with caviar and poached eggs to be the best thing I've ever had for breakfast. Ever.\nWater brought to dog. Treats on site.\nAnd the coolest darn dog fountain outside of entrance you've ever seen.\nDon't keep searching. Need upper east eating for you and your pup, you've found it.\nMaria More than one year ago.\nWe are visiting the area looking for property and looked at this website & found Blue Gator. We were very pleased with how dog friendly they are. Everyone was extremely friendly & accommodating. Starting with the parking attendant(parking is very hard , but we found out they have a shuttle that brings customers from a near parking area). He parked us right in the front. We ordered fish & chips & fried shrimp & it was all very good. We will be back when we go back. Really looking forward to it. Ops, almost forgot, the band starts at 7:00.\nmonica More than one year ago.\nWonderful staff and service, food was delicious. Baylee loved his fresh bowl of water and dog treat; after walking almost 50 blocks:-). We sat outside & Baylee was so eager to sight see he would not sit down. He made friends from strangers just walking by. Will recommend this place for all Dog lovers & if you just wanna eat:-).\nSparky More than one year ago.\nFun place for you and your dog. Sittng outside, the wait staff will bring your dog a bowl of water. The food is very good, everything freshly made. Sunday brunch was great with homemade chicken hash, eggs and biscuits. And, ooh, the bloody marys were some of the best I've ever had. Be sure to look for the picture of Rudy Guiliani with his dog at the Barking Dog Luncheonette.\nOakley More than one year ago.\nThis was an excellent place. The wait staff was great and kind to us. If you are looking for a good place to eat, this is one of the best!\nWe've dug up 1 picture of dogs at Barking Dog for you below. Enjoy!\nWant to feature your creature?
