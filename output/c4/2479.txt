    "text": "A bumper weekend of Easter racing action at the Adrian Flux Arena kicks off on Saturday 20th April 5:30pm with a fans favourite line-up. Unlimited Bangers racing in their East Anglian Championship and will be joined by Two Litre Saloon Stock Cars and 1300cc Stock Cars.\nThe spectator gates will open at 3:30pm. The arena boasts great viewing all around (plenty of under-cover viewing too!), FREE on site and overflow parking, disabled viewing, licensed bars, ample food outlets and other great facilities.\nThere are currently 86 Unlimited Bangers, 38 2L Stock Cars & 43 1300cc Stock Cars booked in to race.\nThis meeting is fully booked - If you are booked in and are no longer able to race please let us know asap as we have reserves who are unable to get a booking. If you do are not booked in and would like to be added to the reserve list please text 07939 580652. Please note if you do not get a booking please do not turn up as you will not be allowed to race.\nThe Unlimited Bangerss make their first appearance at the track since the Icebreaker event in January, with the East Anglian Championship on offer, one of the oldest and most prestigious titles at King\u2019s Lynn. Defending East Anglian Champions Shayne Winsor (160) is not scheduled, so a new name from the star studded line-up looks likely to be added to the trophy this year.\nDo you want to be the headline sponsor - you could be for just \u00a320 - visit this link here to find out how you could win that chance.\nTwo litre World Champion Lee Clarke (247) and Under 25 Champion Callum Gill (757) - both former winners of the title will lead the charge. They will be joined by other former winners including Danny Sutton (439) and a welcome visit from Mark Whittaker (67) who makes a rare banger outing.\nFormer World of Shale champion Dave Vincent (22), National points champion Lee White (830) and former World Champions Davey Cox (119) and Darren Fendley (673) are further big names in a heavyweight line-up.\nBilly Smith (161) also joining us following his outing at the MK1 Almera/ All Sunny meeting two weeks ago, where as you would expect; he was fully involved.\nThose more likely to be looking for a big crash include regular visitors Team Sowter/Filmer, made up of Carl (288) and Taylor Sowter (388), plus Jack (883) and Tom (884) Filmer. Taylor in particular will be looking to stay at the top of the Entertainers league.\nDrivers from far afield are looking to join us, including the Devon duo Buddy (262) and Jonny (362) James, or closer to home with the local Predator representatives; and overseas long distance traveller Dutchman Dennis Vorkink (211) all of which middle of the action.\nOthers to keep an eye on include James Licquorice (51) making a rare Unlimited Banger outing. Scott Gough (99), Aston Burt (246) and Brett Jackson (551) all who like to gat stuck in too!\nDon't expect 246 Aston Burt to be taking home a straight car!\nWith a number of representatives from the entertaining Gladiators, Mad Hatters, Predators and The Aftermath teams, this meeting is going to be a good one!\nThe Saloons are a fans favourite and it\u2019s not hard to work out why - hard impact, no holds barred Stock Car racing \u2013 sit back and listen to the arena fill with the sound of clashing metal. As you would expect the 2 Litre Saloon Stock Cars have once again been in top form around the King\u2019s Lynn oval this year with more the same expected Saturday 20th!\n2L Stock Cars - where action is the attraction!\nLast time here it was a night for the lower graders with each race being won by a White or Yellow grader. Trent Arthurton (610) took the win in the meeting final last time out, no mean feat with a field of top drivers chasing you down.\nRyan Santry (389) took a heat win last time out, the on board video recorder he had fixed last time, made for interesting viewing \u2013 he sure did get stuck in and likely to again this time!\nJoining us from Scotland is Barry Russell (600), who loves his shale racing and very rarely misses a meeting with us; he will be joined by no less than four other fellow Scots; Euan Mathieson (125), Aaryn Triggs (620), Graeme Shevill (661) and Alan Ainslie (777).\nAction is guaranteed whenever 26 Tommy Barnes is on track!\nShane Emerson (888) will lead the charge in the 25 and Under Championship he will have his work cut out with some big, big names looking to take the trophy from him.\nThe entry list joining us is really a who\u2019s who of the 1300 scene; with a lot of the top drivers coming to King\u2019s Lynn to be with us. World of Shale Champion and Points champion Dan Booth (216) will be leading the line-up; the defence of his silver roof points title didn\u2019t get off to the best start, but he will be surely one to watch this weekend.\nJacob Bromley (303) currently leads the National Points, but had a disappointing night here last time 16th March, he will bounce back in form almost certainly.\nBarry Wade (731) follows behind Bromley in second spot in the points chart following a great start to the year and he will be looking to continue that run of form.\nAlso finding some good results early in the season were the likes of Todd Payne (149), Startrax National Points champion Tom Keep (367), Kevin Shinn (400) and Chris Taylor (421), who will all be looking to continue. This group is not to be messed with either and know what the front bumper is for.\nJack Lower (142) and Ben Englestone (769) have been the final winners so far this year at our two orevious meetings; will there be a different final winner this time?\nAll the fun of the fair will be at King's Lynn on Saturday. The good news for mum and dad is that the ride will be free for the kids to go on as often as they like! Once we have confirmation of what ride will be with us on Saturday we will publish details of it here!"
