Missing those halcyon days?\nIn recent weeks we've seen the flipside of the \"25 Things List\" gaining traction on the ol' FB: the \"How Well Do You Know *Your Name Here*?\" quiz.\nIn other words, now our friends aren't offering us tidbits of their lives; they are asking us to report back to them on our knowledge of their personal tidbits.\nAre we up to the challenge, America? So far, we're seeing scores of 40 to 50 percent coming back as friends take other friends' tests. \"Hmm\" might sum it up best. Just hmm.\nMaybe the questions are too difficult? Too focused on minutia? We'd be surprised if even our nearest and dearest can even exactly pinpoint our hair color or height. So, a recommendation: make the questions less hard. And if you do create a challenging quiz, and your pals who take it score on the low side, it might be time to schedule a few more lunches together.\nA positive side effect, perhaps. Facebook creating more face time."
