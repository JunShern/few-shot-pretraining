    "text": "The squash family includes pumpkins, summer squash and winter squash. They are actually edible gourds. There are many types with a wide range of color, size, flavor and textures. Acorn is a type of winter squash that can be harvested in the summer and used for cooking. Cream of the Crop is a specific variety of acorn squash.\nStorage: We suggest you use your squash the week you get it, but it will store up to 3 months. Refrigeration is too humid for a whole squash and they can deteriorate quickly. You can cut up the squash and store piece with more success."
