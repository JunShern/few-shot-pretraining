Tags: ruby.\nWe\u2019ve updated the default version of the Ruby scripting language on our servers from 1.8.7 to 1.9.3.\nPosted January 12th, 2009\tby Robert Mathews\tin Tech Corner. Tags: all servers, perl, ruby, security, server updates.\nWe\u2019ve updated our servers with a Perl security bug fix and a Ruby security update.\nThe updates fix only security bugs, and customers should not notice any changes in how the Perl or Ruby programming languages work.\nPosted November 27th, 2007\tby Robert Mathews\tin Tech Corner. Tags: all servers, mysql, perl, ruby, webmail.\nAn incompatibility with Mac OS Internet Explorer version 5.1 and earlier.\nA problem that could cause an outgoing message to have an invalid \u201cReply-To\u201d field in rare circumstances.\nA bug where messages in the Sent folder could appear out of order.\nAn issue reported by one user that prevented viewing of a message with bad HTML code.\nThese fixes solve all the bugs that we know of in the new Webmail system (although we have plenty of feature requests that we\u2019re working on). If you\u2019re still using the old system, now\u2019s the time to switch, or to let us know why you\u2019re using the old system so we can address that.\nRuby security updates (including libopenssl-ruby).\nPerl and PCRE security updates (this update was intentionally delayed due to the need for extra testing mentioned in the Debian PCRE announcement).\nAs always, let us know if you have any questions or concerns."
