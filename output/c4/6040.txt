    "text": "If you\u2019ve gone on interviews for IT jobs, you probably already have at least a general idea of what you should be doing. Maybe you learned these job interview do\u2019s from your IT staffing firms and technical recruiters, or maybe you learned them from some of your own online research. No matter where you learned these do\u2019s from, there are some nuances you may not know about. Here are some subtleties of interview do\u2019s that your IT staffing agencies and IT recruiters want you to know.\nFirstly, you know the general rule is to dress well for job interviews. However, it\u2019s also important to dress well for the company\u2019s culture. Particularly in IT, dress codes can wildly differ. Talk to your IT recruiting firms about exactly what you should wear to your interview. You don\u2019t want to just assume you should come in a suit. It may cost you the job.\nSecondly, you probably already know no to badmouth a boss or former company to your interviewer. What you may not know is to extend the same rule to your colleagues and coworkers. If you trash talk your current or previous coworkers, hiring managers may wonder if you\u2019re actually a team player or able to work well with others. Do yourself and your IT recruiting agencies a favor: don\u2019t lie, but do avoid saying anything unfavorable about your former or current coworkers, employers, or bosses. By keeping their reputations pristine, you do the same for your own.\nThis entry was posted on Monday, February 23rd, 2015 at 7:58 am and is filed under Advice from IT Recruiters, IT recruiting .
