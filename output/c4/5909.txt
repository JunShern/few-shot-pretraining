Rainy weather doesn\u2019t mean that you have to be stuck inside your room all day. When it rains in Singapore it often pours, but there are still plenty of great things to do and see that are perfect for a rainy day!\n1.\tTake a walk through the cloud forest- Gardens by the Bay is a collection of three gardens. Much of the greenery is located outdoors but the venue has two large indoor conservatories. Visit the Flower Dome Conservatory which covers three acres and has foliage from dry and mild climates like the Mediterranean, South Africa and parts of Australia. It\u2019s sister, the Cloud Forest, replicates cool, moisture-rich ecosystems which are found up to 9000 feet above sea level in Central America and Southeast Asia. The cloud forest is also special in that it features the world\u2019s tallest indoor waterfall. Take a lift to the top of the mountaintop to discover the unique biodiversity and geology of cloud forests and then take a stroll along a walkway in the clouds for an aerial view of the canopy and mountainside below. It\u2019s a unique and magical indoor experience that everyone will love.\n2.\tGet your culture fix at a museum \u2013 Singapore has many great museums.
