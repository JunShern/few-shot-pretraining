    "text": "Friends, I have some pretty exciting news. I\u2019ve been nominated me for a Liebster blogging award. This is an award that\u2019s given to new bloggers as a way to recognize & encourage them in their work.\nAyanna over at 21 Flavors of Splendor has nominated me for this award, and I couldn\u2019t be more grateful. I\u2019ve been following Ayanna, pretty much since I started blogging. She\u2019s always been encouraging and this nomination is just further proof of that. Head over to check out her blog, oh and her Instagram is one full of encouragement and fun peaks into her everyday!\nAnother blog that I really love is Rachael\u2019s over at Oh Lord Help Us. This is a woman sharing her faith and sharing her resources. It\u2019s clear from the moment you enter the world of her blog, she\u2019s looking to be real, have real conversation, and share her real learning. In addition to her blog, she\u2019s also making some pretty sweet jewelry pieces. And as if that weren\u2019t enough, she\u2019s donating the proceeds from sales to invest back in her ministry to share Gods truth with woman of faith to know who they were created to be. This is a ministry and blog that will encourage women to live to their full potential as strong and fierce daughters of God. Check her out over at her blog, Instagram or any of her social media accounts. She\u2019s always dishing out some encouragement.\nThe rules of this nomination encourage each blogger to share some randomness about ourselves. This is such a fun way to get to know each other a little better. So here we go!\nI often make myself giggle. I\u2019m the funniest person I know. Kidding..a little!\nI\u2019ve watched \u201cThe Office\u201d and embarrassing number of times, I could probably quote the entire series.\nMy family and I speak fluent movie quotes\u2026it keeps things interesting!\nI typically eat all the snacks after my kids are asleep, then claim to have no idea what happened to them. NO SELF CONTROL!\nSome more encouraged fun is answering questions from the person who nominated you, and posing 10 of your own for your nominations to answer on their website. Ayanna asked some really good ones, check them out below.\nI started blogging as a creative outlet. At first, I was into the thrill of learning the in\u2019s and out\u2019s of the process. Then I realized, I had a voice, actual things to say that could help others. This is why I continue to blog.\nThe name of my website perfectly describes the main themes of my life. We\u2019re a family totally dependent of God\u2019s grace to make it through the struggles of everyday life. Giggling is how we keep sane!\nItaly, definitely Italy! Or maybe Main, I hear they have the most amazing Autumn seasons.\nWhat is your favorite fiction book?\nIs it bad that I don\u2019t have one? I\u2019m not much of a reader. Lately my reading is mostly of other\u2019s blogs. I\u2019ve been learning so much from my blogging buddies, and have gained new perspectives.\nNew friends! Admittedly, I\u2019m not a social media person at all. In fact before my blog, I had almost no presence on any of it. Since I started blogging, I\u2019ve made many friends all around the globe and have joined in prayer, joys, and sorrows with them.\nIf you could meet any person, who is still alive, who would it be and why?\nI had to really think about this one, but here\u2019s who I came up with\u2026ANY MISSIONARY. I know that God has me tethered to my current place, so I often look in amazement at folks who are picking up and moving out all in an effort to further the Kingdom of heaven and help as many people as possible. It\u2019s a pretty interesting calling and life to lead.\nCoffee & my Bible. I know that\u2019s two things, but it measures up to one good morning.\nIf you could eat one food every day and not worry about the calories, what would it be?\nIce cream, with tons of stuff in it. I love stuff, any stuff, in my ice cream!\nWhat do you see happening on your blog in year 5?\nI\u2019ve started praying for God to use my website as a way to lift others, and to connect a body of of like minded people to encourage each other and share life stories. I\u2019m letting God lead me at this point, I\u2019m willing to turn in any direction He leads me to.\nWhat\u2019s your favorite activity (outside of blogging, of course!)?\nWhat\u2019s the one T.V. show that you hope(d) never goes (went) off the air?\nIf you were to start a charity, who would it benefit?\nAre you a morning person? If so, please help me with some tips!\nWhat\u2019s one piece of advice you can give to new bloggers?\nWhat\u2019s you favorite social media platform?\nWhat are some goals you have for your website?\nLadies, I\u2019m so excited to read all the answers to these questions! Have fun with your answers.\nThank you again to Ayanna, who gave me this opportunity to not only share more about myself, but to keep this recognition train rolling.\nThank the person who nominated you, and post a link to their blog on your blog.\nDisplay the award on your blog \u2014 by including it in your post, or by having it as the feature image.\nWrite a 150-300 word post about your favorite blog that is not your own. Explain why you like the blog, provide links.\nProvide 10 random facts about yourself.\nAnswer the questions from your nominator.\nNominate 5 \u2013 11 blogs that you feel deserve the award, who have less than 200 followers.\nAsk your nominees questions of your own.\nJesus really is the reason-Sorry Santa!\nWelcome to this space on the world wide web I\u2019ve carved out for faith, family, food & funnies. Here I\u2019m sharing all the things that bring me joy.\nI didn\u2019t always know God, but this much I do know, He\u2019s always been with me. I\u2019m so sure that God intended for us to share with each other for the sake of community & encouragement. So for that reason, I\u2019m laying out for you all that I\u2019m learning.\nOh, and I have the privilege of bringing you the testimonies of some serious God loving women!\nFeel free to jump in, leave comments & share along with us.\n(c) 2016 - All Rights Reserved."
