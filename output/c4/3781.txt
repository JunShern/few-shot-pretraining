    "text": "The continuing surge of Silicon Valley giants gobbling up Tech City startups has led some to question whether London will ever be able to produce its own billion-dollar tech company that it craves so badly.\nThe continuing surge of Silicon Valley giants gobbling up Tech City start-ups has led some to question whether London will ever be able to produce its own billion-dollar tech company that it craves so badly.\nTowards the end of last week, Menlo Park-based Facebook agreed to buy certain assets of Monoidics for an undisclosed fee, allowing the social media giant to identify bugs on mobile apps and websites with the start-up\u2019s code-checking software.\nMonoidics, founded in 2009 by Italian entrepreneur Dino Distefano, will move its engineering team into Facebook\u2019s London office once the deal has fully closed.\n\u201cRight away we knew this was our chance to take what we\u2019ve built to the next level. Joining the Facebook team opens up a world of new opportunity for our technology and for our individual and collective scientific expertise,\u201d said Monoidics on its website.\nMeanwhile, Palo Alto-based Cloudera purchased Google Campus based machine learning and data mining start-up Myrrix at the beginning of last week.\nOther London-based companies to have been snapped up by Silicon Valley giants recently include Summly and TweetDeck, which were bought by Yahoo and Twitter for \u00a330m and \u00a325m respectively.\nWhile the start-ups cash in on these deals and see it as a positive move, there are concerns that some of the best tech companies are failing to reach their full potential by selling out too quickly.\nMost UK start-ups would consider selling for \u00a3100m or even \u00a310m as a \u2018major success\u2019, while some founders turn into serial entrepreneurs, said Holway.\nHolway claimed that many companies set up with the intention of being bought by global players and start-ups openly say this to VCs.\n\u201cEven when we are in sight of a $1bn IPO it is likely to be a NASDAQ float rather than in London,\u201d said Holway, claiming that Shazam, King, Markit and Sophos will probably opt for NASDAQ over the London Stock Exchange.\nStart-ups need support from both the public and private sectors if they are to flourish in the UK and become tech giants.\nHowever, earlier this year, MPs on the Science and Technology Committee found that the government is failing technology entrepreneurs and does not have a coherent strategy to support the commercialisation of technology innovation.\nThe Select Committee\u2019s report found that a lack of funding and the inability to foster long-term SME growth was stifling the UK\u2019s tech scene.\n\u201cThe UK\u2019s university and science sector is a global success, but the challenge for government is how that world class academic research can be translated into commercial activity,\u201d said Chair of the Select Committee, MP Andrew Miller, following the release of the report in March.\nBenjamin Southworth, Tech City deputy CEO, told Techworld that Silicon Valley has been buying start-ups across the world for the past 15 years and the recent acquisitions reflect the high calibre of London\u2019s start-ups, which have benefited from a number of recently introduced initiatives.\nThe government-led initiatives, such as the Entrepreneur Visa and the Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme (SEED EIS), were introduced to help start-ups access the talent and funding they need at an early stage.\n\u201cAll this means that London is now a highly attractive proposition for companies at every stage of their growth trajectory,\u201d said Southworth.\nMeanwhile, the High Growth Segment was recently created by the London Stock Exchange to give high-growth companies a new route to a UK market listing.\nHowever, Holway argues that the High Growth Segment has had little impact. \u201cIf it had, we would be seeing some IPOs by now and those like Shazam and Sophos wouldn't be thinking NASDAQ,\u201d he said.\nA report out last week found that London\u2019s Tech City start-up cluster became home to more than 15,000 new businesses over the past year.\nFounder of Seedrs \u2013 the a UK based online platform for investing in start-ups \u2013 Jeff Lynn, told Techworld: \u201cSure the Silicon Valley guys will gobble up some of them, but in this robust ecosystem, many others will grow to substantial scale.\nHowever, Lynn believes that the UK is going to see an increasing number of businesses decide that acquisition isn\u2019t the right path and that they\u2019re better to grow naturally.\nWhen a company sells up, the surrounding community may be concerned that talent, IP and other assets will be relocated, leaving things worse than they were before.\nBut what do entrepreneurs need to do in order to create a billion-dollar company?\nRobbie Hughes, CEO of clinical management software company, Qinec, told Techworld that British people need to change their attitude if the country wants to contend with the US.\nMany of the founders who cash in are likely to be entrepreneurs who start other businesses in the UK.\nThere are pockets of the UK where billion-dollar tech companies exist, such as Cambridge, where there are 12 companies with turnovers over 12 billion sollars.\nBillion-dollar IPOs that have occurred in Cambridge include CSR and ARM, but neither of them are on the scale of Google or Cisco.\nOne UK start-up that has been tipped as a billion-dollar company is Cambridge-based RealVNC.\n\u201cThere are plenty of companies here who are going for the big-time and who are not interested in acquisition,\u201d RealVNC founder and CEO Andy Harter told Techworld."
