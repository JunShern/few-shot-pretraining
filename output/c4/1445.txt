    "text": "On damp winds they\u2019re blown in, the thunder of their blades as they slice through the air echoing over golden fields. Stalwart defenders of the nation, here they\u2019re far from war torn lands: no bombs or bullets to lay them low, only nature\u2019s unpredictable buffets to keep them humble.\nThis afternoon I was down at the wildflower meadow with my notepad and my camera when two Chinook helicopters from a local RAF airbase began circling overhead. I quickly snapped a few shots of them as they passed over, thinking they\u2019d soon be gone, only to realise that they were actually landing at the small airfield on the outskirts of the village. Now, that is not something that normally happens! I hurriedly made my way over.\nUnfortunately, I didn\u2019t actually manage to make it quite all the way to the airfield before they were taking off again, but I did manage to find a position where I could get a few decent pictures before they left. Luckily, several other villagers had also been out and about and one of them had managed to speak to one of the pilots. It seems that a bird had collided with the windscreen of one of the helicopters, forcing it to land.\nI hadn\u2019t actually planned to post today as I\u2019m still in the middle of CampNano \u2013 meaning I\u2019ve been busy editing and lengthening the flash fictions I\u2019m planning to publish as compilations on Amazon. The other photographs and poems I\u2019ve been posting lately have all ready to go since June! Another of those will probably be posted in a few days time.\nThis post is for Jacqueline\u2019s Echoes of my Neighbourhood challenge.\nexcellent Louise and all the best on Amazon!!!!\nThanks, Cybele. \ud83d\ude42 From what I\u2019ve seen helping my mum out with her books on Amazon, it\u2019s the promotion that\u2019s the hard part!\nVery cool, those Chinooks are pretty noisy aren\u2019t they?\nI\u2019ll probably put up a post about my compilation when it\u2019s ready to go, though that may still be a while off. I haven\u2019t even thought about the cover art yet!\nGreat photos! I bet that was something to see!\nThanks, PJ. \ud83d\ude42 They were very impressive. I just wish I could have got a little closer before they took off again!\nSuch cool photos! Good luck!\nThank you, Antonia. \ud83d\ude42 I\u2019m glad you like them. They were a very unexpected sight!"
