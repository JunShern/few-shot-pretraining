    "text": "As it is written in God\u2019s Word, \u201call you have to do is believe\u201c. There are numerous instances of this specific word or one which has the word \u201cbelieve\u201d in it such as \u201cAbraham believed God and it was counted to him for righteousness\u201c. Why do I bring this word up again on this site? Because it is needed and necessary for all who are looking for and seeking Jesus to believe in Him, not that He existed but believe in Him for salvation!\nEven the demons and Satan know about Jesus and that He is the Son of God. But knowing about Him and believing that He existed doesn\u2019t bring salvation. Consider this: if someone told you that you had been given one million dollars and that it was available to you, would you believe them just by their word or would you have to see it and know that it was there? Take that a bit further. You know it is there and it is yours but you never claim it, is it doing you any good at all? Not even a little bit.\nThat is the same place that many people today are in concerning their salvation. They have heard a sermon telling them that it is available and that it is free to claim. All they have to do is believe that it is theirs and claim it by asking Jesus for their forgiveness and that He should come into their lives and make them whole. The problem is that even though many know that salvation is available to them just as easy as the million dollars in the previous paragraph, given a choice they would rather have the money.\nBecause, in the world that we live in, money is immediate and useful. Salvation only means something to you if you are looking toward eternity rather than just looking at tomorrow. The problem with this type of thinking is just like the prodigal son, once the money is gone you are worse off than you were before. Money is like your life. It is a puff of smoke and it is gone in an instant of time but salvation takes you to an eternal home where life never ends and it only gets better.\nConsider that and seek out the One Who can provide you with salvation and an eternal home too.\nMake sure where you will spend it.\nPrevious Post God is still in control!"
