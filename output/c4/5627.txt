    "text": "When we founded The Norfolk Painting School in 2007 we set out to redefine art tuition in the UK by championing the idea that painting could and should be taught both as an art and a craft.\nOur principles were \u2013 and are \u2013 simple. Skills enable creativity, and the best way to make skills useful for everybody is to teach principles not instances.\nLots of schools offer courses, here are the things we include as standard.\nStructured, skills based courses with practical outcomes which can be combined to develop the perfect learning program for you.\nDedicated purpose designed spacious, studios with daylight lighting, demonstration theatres, big screens, live cameras on the tutor and professional workstations for every student, not \u2018make do\u2019 art rooms where you crowd around a demo.\nFully trained in-house tutors who will teach you a proven and integrated program, not jobbing artists showcasing their style. All of our tutors are also exhibiting artists in their own right.\nProfessionally compiled and printed handouts and short notes to augment any personal notes you make on your course.\n\u2018Skills enable creativity, and the best way to make skills useful for everybody is to teach principles not instances\u2019.\nA range of comfortable and affordable school properties near the school providing dedicated student accommodation, plus help booking suitable alternatives nearby if you prefer to stay with a third party B&B or hotel.\nOur student houses are clean, modern, and include everything you need from fresh linen, to good showers, free WIFI and relaxing outdoor spaces to enjoy a glass of wine after school.\nPersonalised booking and advice on finding the right course for you, plus help with transfers from stations and airports using our trustworthy drivers.\nGreat facilities at the school, including a student cafe (serving complimentary refreshments and light lunches), ample free off road parking and all the attractions of the inspirational and unspoilt North Norfolk Coast a short drive from our studios.\nTechnicians and specialists to help you at the school, every class for instance has a dedicated studio assistant so you never waste your time setting up or scrubbing down.\nA commitment to education that means we invest each year in our apprentice and work experience programs; helping young artists make a good start with their career.\nFinally \u2013 and this may surprise you \u2013 we don\u2019t have a \u2018house style\u2019, in fact we actively work to ensure that each and every one of our students paints like themselves, not us. Glance at one of our Diploma student shows and you\u2019ll see that we train unique painters.\nMeet the team. Left to right. Studio Technician, Glynn. Contemporary Oils specialist tutor Silvi. Gallery Manager Jim, traditional and figurative oils tutor Fen, general Manager Jane, Course Director and diploma tutor Martin, Studio dog Monty, Martin\u2019s apprentice Bryony with studio dog Oscar, Studio Assistant and graduate Pete, Hospitality and general assistant Lucy.\nOur entire course program is devised and written by Course Director and exhibiting artist Martin Kinnear, a widely recognised and published expert in oil painting techniques. You can see a selection of Martin\u2019s work at www.makinnear.com, follow his blog here, and read his articles in magazines such as The Artist, Artists & Illustrators, Leisure Painter and International Artist.\nMartin is supported by a team of tutors, assistant tutors and specialists such as studio assistants and technicians. So on a course you will have access to your tutor, an assistant tutor as well as be able to book an appointment on the day or in the future to discuss your progress with the school.\nBy working as a team to deliver aspects of the School\u2019s program we are able to provide not just tuition but an integrated and personalised path for your artistic and creative development.\nBecause our team are all professional working artists, they are uniquely placed to truly understand why students come to the school for inspiration, help and guidance.\nYou can read about our colourman Robert Gamblin at www.gamblincolors.com and see out why Martin chose to work closely with him after we trialled some of his New Megilp (a modern equivalent to Turner\u2019s signature glazing medium). We were the first teaching organisation, outside of the restoration studios of internationally famous galleries, to use Gamblin materials in Europe.\nArtists first, then tutors. All of our team from top to bottom are teachers who understand what it is to live and work as self representing professional painters.\nWhile the main School is based in Norfolk, we also have a teaching studio on Anglesey serving North Wales, Ireland and the North of England. For details of the best place to start your painting journey call Jane on 01485 528588.\nThe Norfolk Painting School is bigger than you think, here\u2019s our Yr Efail studio on Anglesey."
