    "text": "In many countries, shipping CBD creams is illegal, but thankfully, that is not the case in Ireland. Cannabis-based products are now being sold legally in many health stores and other specialized stores throughout this country. However, even though the use of CBD oils is completely legal, there still emains some confusion about it in the general public. CBD is short for cannabidiol which is a chemical from the cannabis plant, but it does not produce any psychoactive effects typically associated with cannabis. This means that it won\u2019t get you \u201chigh\u201d in the way that recreational users of this drug know. Now, when it comes to the actual sale of CBD creams, they are currently not yet approved by the HPRA. As a result, doctors can\u2019tprescribe them even though they are still being sold in Ireland. As a result, it is currently purchased and used as a supplemental health product. There are many benefits of using CBD cream, and we\u2019ll now look at some of them.\nOne of the first benefits of using CBD cream is that it can be used to treat skin inflammation. Cannabinoids have very high anti-inflammatory properties which basically means it can help your body and skin in many ways. This cream can help your skin to rejuvenate and repair itself which alleviates a number of skin conditions. Many people use it as an addition to their daily skin care routine while others use it to treat specific skin issues.\nEczema is one of the more common skin issues that responds favorably to CBD cream. Unfortunately, eczema is a very painful skin condition which causes the skin to itch terribly. This issue typically shows up on the face and neck of affected persons. Many people who have treated it with CBD creams have noticed full or partial relief when it comes to the symptoms of eczema.\nNext, another excellent benefit of using CBD cream is that it can help with pain. There has been a great deal of research that shows that CBD helps to reduce the pain in people who suffer from chronic pain or other types of pain. If you have bone and joint pain, arthritis or muscle aches, then you can definitely benefit from using CBD cream.\nAnother benefit of using CBD cream is that it can improve the look and feel of your skin. When used regularly, it can make your skin look brighter and more radiant while making it stronger. It can also be used to prevent the occurrence of wrinkles, and it can also reduce stretch marks or be used as a preventative measure against them. If you have any itches or rashes, then the cream will also help to reduce those issues and even take them away completely.\nIn closing, we have just looked at whether shipping and selling CBD creams in Ireland is legal as well as the benefits of using this cream. Ireland is certainly a great place to be since CBD creams are completely legal and you can purchase them at most health or specialist stores.\nHow To Make DIY CBD Cream And Salve.\nCBD has numerous health benefits and uses.

Place your olive and coconut oil in the saucepan over low heat and continue stirring while the cannabis is still in the oven. Remove the decarboxylated cannabis from the oven and mix it into the oil infused with coconut. Ensure that low heat is maintained and continue stirring this mixture for about 25 minutes. The heat should be little to ensure that the cannabis is not scorched leading to a decrease in the oil\u2019s potency. Note that olive oil has a lower smoke point than other oils. After the twenty-five minutes, pour the mixture into the jar and set it aside. Add the beeswax in the saucepan and heat until it is melted. Once it melts, add the infused coconut oil. You could add some essential oils such as lavender or peppermint oil. Once the mixture is mixed thoroughly, remove from the heat and transfer to containers.
