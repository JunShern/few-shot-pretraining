Sign up to work with us below and we will be in touch!\nSome of the names we will be working with in 2019 include AMP Lost & Found Festival, Neighbourhood Weekender, Parklife Festival, Bluedot Festival and Kendal Calling.\nWe only collect and use your data for the purpose of considering you for volunteer and staffing opportunities offered through Proud Events and Live Stock Brands.\nThe information we ask you to provide is the information we need to be able to consider you for opportunities for volunteering and employment only.\nOnly people employed by Proud Events who we authorise to be involved in staffing are allowed to have access to your records and only for the purpose of considering you for opportunities for volunteering or employment.\nWe need to share some information with other parties who are involved in the events your are volunteering or working on. This is usually your name and contact details such as a phone number or email address. We do this on the condition this information is not held beyond the point it is required. For a very small number of partners, they rather than us, will pay you and we will share the information necessary to make payments for work.\nThere are times when we will hold some information for a period after you have deleted your account or requested we delete your account. The information we retain is that required by HMRC for tax and payroll purposes.\nIf you are having any issues with our sign up form please email us at staffing@proudevents.co.uk and we will come back to you as soon as possible."
