    "text": "Our church in Burton Overy is a humble medieval one, dedicated to St Andrew, consisting of a nave, a north aisle, a spacious chancel, and a tower in which there are three bells. There is a 15th century screen of richly carved oak and an old ironbound chest? The font is circular and plain. In 1220, this church was under the patronage of the abbey of St. Ebrulf at Urica in Normandy.\nSt. Andrew's is available for Marriages, Christenings, Thanksgiving for a Child and Funerals.\nThe church council is in the process of finalising plans for a kitchen and toilet in the church. We have for years managed to provide drinks by filling water holders from an outside tap and by using the village hall toilet, which can seem a long distance away when you are of senior or very junior years! We are able to use the money received from legacies to finance these improvements. We are not able to use legacies for the day to day running costs of the church, which continue to rise!\nMorning Service changes We have also made some changes to one of our services. We have changed the 10:45 am to 9:15 am service. We have the first three Sundays in Great Glen and the 4th Sunday of each month in Burton Overy. The service is a more informal service designed to involve young and old alike. We had our first informal service on the 22nd of October and it was lovely to see the church full of life. We had several children, young families and older generations as well. We celebrated communion and the children were able to show us their craftwork at the end of the service. We also sang familiar hymns to a guitar. Our hope is to make our services accessible to all. Do come and see for yourself and join us.\nThe Church Tower Repairs are now completed and paid for. The work and removal of scaffolding were completed on time. The only hitch we had was the scaffolding alarm going off on a Saturday evening, which meant the contractors had to come over from Nottingham - even Nick Jones could not stop it from ringing!\nThe New Path There has been a big change in the churchyard in the last few weeks. If you haven't been up to the church recently do come by and have a look at our new path. Due to the footfall of all those who come to events like the Christmas Tree Festival, weddings, church services and other events it was decided that it would be good to make the surface more accessible for those in who have walking difficulties. There are also plans a foot to add a hand rail for the steps once planning permission has been granted. We hope the new path will make it easier for everyone to come and join us during the up coming events.\nJunior Tennis starts again for the summer on Wednesday, 3rd May at 5.00pm at The Springs, Carlton Lane, Burton Overy. Dave Henson and Craig Langton have very kindly offered their time to come and teach the children. Young children and beginners from 5.00-6.00. Intermediate players from 6.00pm. Any queries 0116-259-2440.\nAscension Day Tower Service at 7.30am on Thursday 25th May Come and climb the tower early in the day (or remain at ground level if you wish) for this annual short service to remember the Ascension of Jesus. Followed by bacon baps at The Springs, Carlton Lane.\nSparklers (Monday 9.30 at the Methodist Church Hall) and Toddler Caf\u00e9 Wednesday 10.00 at St Cuthbert's) are very popular with young families. We sing songs, have a bible story, say prayers, play and drink coffee! Spread the word!"
