    "text": "The bridal look would not be complete without the accessories to enhance and accent the outfit. Jewelry is a must in every bride\u2019s accessory list, and the headpiece is by far the most understated, though important ornamentation which the bride can wear on the wedding day. There are numerous varieties and styles of the headpiece to consider, and it may take some time before any woman can decide on which to go for.\nBut if the intended effect for the headpiece is one of quaint elegance, not of overstatement, then the bridal comb is the best accessory which meets the purpose. Bridal combs are simple hair accessories which are normally opted for because of their functional use, rather than for ornamentation.\nThey are meant to keep the hair gathered neatly away from the face, either by holding them in chignons, to control tresses, or to keep a hair twist and bun in place. This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that they cannot be ornamented with precious stones, just like other jewelry. Actually, the types of precious and semi-precious stones which can accent the bridal comb are only limited by the bride\u2019s fancy.\nDiamonds are the undisputed favorite in bridal comb ornamentation. They are classic symbols of everlasting love and eternal commitment. Diamonds vary in shape and size (and also in color), but for the bridal comb, small, intricately cut pieces arrayed in elegant pattern across the length of the comb will provide the best effect.\nThe light will play on the myriads of little mirrors, and will add sparkle to the blushing aura exuded by the bride. Whether it is synthetic or the real thing, diamonds don\u2019t disappoint in lending the accent piece a touch of classic gracefulness.\nI am thrilled to introduce you to JewishWeddingNetwork.com, a blog that takes the \u201coy vey\u201d out of planning your big day! This is a place where you can also learn about Jewish wedding traditions and take the stress out of wedding planning."
