    "text": "There\u2019s something nostalgic about the vintage look, even when its artificially added to a digital photo. Instagram themes such as Slumber and Valencia, which give that vintage look, are some of the app\u2019s most popular.\nThere are numerous how-to\u2019s to get the vintage look in both Lightroom and Photoshop. Today we\u2019ll be going over an example of how to achieve it in darktable.\nAs an example, we\u2019ll use a photo that I took of a classic bike that I own. This is not a particularly good photo (I was shooting in Manual and got the exposure wildly wrong), so we\u2019ll see if it looks any better with a vintage touch in keeping with the age of the bike.\nThe picture you see above has a boosted exposure (and an overexposed sky) and a corrected white balance. Everything else is the darktable default.\nThe first thing we\u2019ll do is adjust the tone curve. By raising the lower left part of the curve, we dull the blackest shadows, and reduce the contrast.\nThe grass is now noticeably less bright.\nOld film pictures often had a slight tonal tinge to them, which we can easily add in the split toning module. Use one of the presets (sepia is probably your best bet), or pick your own colours. Because I wasn\u2019t paying attention, I gave the shadows a warm feel, and the highlights a cold blue tint (usually this would be the other way around).\nIf you select the sepia preset you will probably need to dial down the compression slider, or the saturation, otherwise you will have a very orange photo.\nNo vintage look would be complete without a slight vingette, which is easily added in darktable.\nAs we can see, its hard to make a poor picture great, even with editing. However, I think you would have to agree that its an improvement.\nAnd that is one way to create a basic vintage look in darktable."
