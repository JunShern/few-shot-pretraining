Most of the museums in Dallas and Fort Worth have specials going over the weekend to encourage parents and kids to visit.\nGame night on the patio \u2013 Perhaps you can\u2019t spend all day together, well, you still have the evening. Order a Palio\u2019s pizza and set up a game night for your family and friends. Play outside on the patio to really enjoy the last of summer.\nTake in a movie \u2013 Another option for those who prefer the indoors, go watch a family-friendly movie with the kids. Afterwards, talk to them about the film, asking questions to get them to really explore what they saw and expand their imagination.\nRemember: A Palio\u2019s pizza pairs perfectly with all of these fun, family activities.\nNo matter what you choose to do this Labor Day weekend in the metroplex, just remember to have fun! The memories you make today will stay with you forever. Get your family and friends together and enjoy the company, be present in the event, and try to stay off your phone! Once you use it to order your Palio\u2019s pizza to feed everyone, there is no need to pick it back up! Now, go celebrate!"
