    "text": "So it\u2019s not your imagination. I really haven\u2019t posted since July! I felt it was time to step back for a bit and wait for the Lord to nudge me toward my laptop, in His perfect timing. A holy nudge came this evening, so here I am!\nI\u2019ve been working on healing and adjusting back to single life, but also dealing with some health issues, which thankfully have finally improved for the most part. Recently my health had even kept me away from church and from volunteering at Simonka House a couple times, but I was able to return to both, and even shared a new poem at the women\u2019s shelter on Sunday night.\nFather God, why a baby?\nruling from a golden tower.\nHe could\u2019ve shown Who is boss!\nof wood, like His destined cross.\nFather God, You sent a baby.\nShepherds couldn\u2019t believe their eyes!\nbegun from one lowly birth.\nYour power and love have no disguise.\nWho became my Savior and King!\nthat made the herald angels sing.\nOn my way to Simonka on Sunday night, I thought about the amazing amount of trust that my friends in ministry have placed in me to share my poems and thoughts, especially as I\u2019m only given the message theme a few days prior. They actually have no idea what I will share until I voice it from the podium in the small chapel room! I\u2019m also continually amazed at the trust the Lord puts in me to be a bearer of His love and hope to those souls who desperately need it. At times I feel like Mary, in the sense that I\u2019m an ordinary woman who God can use in small and sometimes profound ways to spread the Word and further His kingdom.\nYet God specializes in using the ordinary to show His extraordinary love, grace and mercy. All we need to do is keep Him first in our lives and to keep ourselves available, and He works His perfect plan through these imperfect vessels. Glory be to God!\nGod sacrificed His Son for us, sending Him to earth in the form of a baby who eventually gave His life so that we could have eternal life in heaven. Let us daily offer ourselves as living sacrifices (Romans 12:1), giving our time, talent and treasures so that others may also accept the Greatest Gift they can receive. Not just at Christmas, but any time throughout the year!\nI\u2019m not sure when I will post next. Less poems have flowed into my notebooks lately, but there is definitely fodder for future posts, as the Lord leads.\nUntil next time, blessings to you, this day and always!\nIt\u2019s an earlier, shorter post this week. I\u2019m giving myself a small break, and also wanted to leave more time open for you to spend with loved ones. Happy Thanksgiving!\nSitting here typing this, I\u2019m basking in the glow of my laptop screen, of course, but I\u2019m also enjoying the fruits of my labor on Saturday: I put up Christmas lights in the living room. Perhaps it was hasty of me, but it\u2019s been increasingly gloomy outside and darker earlier. I needed a bit of cheer.\nSo, without further ado, here is a poem with a theme of thankfulness. Many of my poems speak of being thankful for this or that, but I actually wrote this one around Thanksgiving, several years ago.\nour many blessings to count.\nonly the best for you He brings.\n\u2013praising God for every day.\n\u2013 a perfect love that never ends.\nIt is a joyful song of praise that always lifts my spirits, thinking of how good God is, and all He\u2019s done in my life!"
