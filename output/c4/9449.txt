    "text": "Here are a few questions which you might have on dog training. Hope the answers can help you.\n1 1)\tWhat are the two popular methods for training dogs?\n2 2)\tWhat do you do under Positive reinforcement?\n3 3)\tWhat do you do under Alpha Dog Training?\n4 4)\tWhat can you do to start housetraining your puppy?\n5 5)\tHow do you know if an Obedience school is good enough for your dog?\n6 6)\tIf your dog barks, what are the common reasons why?\n1)\tWhat are the two popular methods for training dogs?\nThe two popular methods for dog training are the Positive reinforcement method and the Alpha Dog training method. The first one operates based mainly on rewards, while the second one focuses on punishments.\n2)\tWhat do you do under Positive reinforcement?\nUnder this method, you can very simply ignore your dog when it is being naughty or when it has done something wrong. You don\u2019t pay attention to it, you don\u2019t give it any treats, you don\u2019t pet it. By ignoring your dog, you\u2019re basically giving it the message that its behavior doesn\u2019t merit any special attention. If it\u2019s doing something good, you give it a reward.\n3)\tWhat do you do under Alpha Dog Training?\nUnder this method, real punishments are being employed just to instill a sense of discipline and control on your dog. You can use these punishment methods for the times when your dog refuses to do what it is supposed to to, or when your dog does something that it\u2019s not supposed to.\n4)\tWhat can you do to start housetraining your puppy?\nBelieve it or not, puppies are already trainable. There are three things you can try out with your pupper so you can train it early. First, make it go on a regular eating schedule and be strict in implementing it. Second, go out with it early in the morning so it can poop. Third, you can try to keep it in a crate for an hour or so.\n5)\tHow do you know if an Obedience school is good enough for your dog?\nWell, the first thing you have to look out for is credentials. Ask yourself these questions: Do they have a lot of students or do you seem to be the only one keen on enrolling? You should be able to read important signs when it comes to the trustworthiness of the institution itself.\n6)\tIf your dog barks, what are the common reasons why?\nTop three common reasons for a dog barking are the following: first, it feels fear or threat. Second, it probably seeks your attention. Third, it is probably suffering from separation anxiety, upon being left alone.\nDaniel L. Graham is a certified dog trainer, and has been training and correcting dog behaviors for a few years now.
