    "text": "I have given a list of sins from the New Testament on another page. If you would like to see the list, this is the link: \"Names of Sins\". One of these sins may stop us from inheriting the kingdom of God. Jesus Christ has accused the religious leadership of that day for preventing people from entering the kingdom of God. Present day these accusations can be exactly imposed on the church leadership, bishops, pastors, evangelists, and others, for leading the congregation or their followers away from inheriting the kingdom of God. Jesus Christ has put it in Matthew 23 the entire status of religious (Christian) leaders explicitly. You may read the entire chapter. Let me quote one verse from it, and a few more.\n\"Matthew 23:13 But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in. 5:20 For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.\" That is, the pastors and evangelists are those who prevent the people from going to heaven. \"Matthew 18:3 And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. 4 Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.\" If we don't humble ourselves, we cannot enter heaven. \"John 3:5 Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.\" Reference link is: \"Born of water\".\nIt is important to know these scripture verses in order to escape from the deceptions of preachers. \"1 Corinthians 6:9 Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, 10 Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. 11 And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.\" They were about to go to hell. But they escaped. You can also escape. \"Galatians 5:19 Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, 20 Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, 21 Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. Ephesians 5:3 But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints; 4 Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks. 5 For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. 6 Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience. 7 Be not ye therefore partakers with them.\" Look at all verses, and don't fail to look at verse 6. It says not to be deceived by the preachers. They say that as long as you are part of the church, sing songs and pray, you will go to heaven. That is a lie. Obey what God is telling us in the Bible. Obey what Jesus Christ says, to inherit the kingdom of heaven."
