You now have an empty folder.\nEssential steps to successfully set up later in the 30 minutes UWMC will give you.\nSelect from the list of patient numbers.\nOpen up the patient\u2019s records.\nBookmark it the way you want it presented at tumor board.\nUseful presentation may mean 3-on-1 with the X-ray or MRI pre and post-contrast; some triptych of images that makes sense in the presentation of the patient. For example: initial x-ray of tumor, MRI of tumor, and CT with lung metastases. (Don\u2019t forget to check for chest CTs!) Bookmark. Save into Sarcoma Conference folder.\nBefore closing the study, check that you can click on it in the Sarcoma Conference list, and that it appears as desired.\nRepeat until all studies are in the Sarcoma Conference folder.\nOne of the reason the triptych helps is that you can reference all three easily.\nSequentially open all cases from your Sarcoma Conference folder and navigate through the open exams.\nIf for some reason the system crashes, you\u2019re saved if your studies were bookmarked beforehand as outlined above.\nAs people arrive and the room fills us, the presenter (the Orthopaedic Oncology Fellow) the Radiologist presents imaging findings, followed by the Pathologist\u2019s findings and then between the multi-disciplinary review the treatment plan is made.\nPace yourself. You\u2019ll need to cover a number of cases in an hour. Keep descriptions brief. Long, extended differential diagnosis is unnecessary.\nTake the 11:15am shuttle labeled \u201cUWMC\u201d arriving at 11:23am.\nCross Pacific Street and enter the hospital at the main entrance (information desk straight ahead).\nTurn left and walk past the hospital gift shop.\nTurn right just you finish passing the shop and walk down the hallway passing an espresso stand on your left and you\u2019ll be at the Cascade elevators. Landmark: sound sculpture.\nWait for the elevators down to the 1st floor or take the stairs (faster).\nOn the 1st floor outside the Cascade elevators, turn right through the pair of automatic double doors, veer right and then veer left (not really a choice, luckily) following the twisting corridor, with signs above reading Plaza Caf\u00e9 (although you will not go as far).\nThere will be a right turn and Anatomic Pathology, NE110, will be right in front of you.\nRoom K is within. If you get lost, call the Secretary Virginia Lore (206.598.2037), or myself (206-598-2982).\nAlternate (faster? and takes you past Plaza Cafe if you need a snack prior to conf): Enter the main hospital entrance but turn RIGHT to the Pacific Elevators. Go down to the 1st floor and turn right off the elevators, following signs for the Cascade elevators. Anatomic Pathology will be on your left.\n** This may change\u2026.may not do RadOnc in the afternoons. Check with Savannah or Dr. Chew for the schedule. You will have lunch at 1 pm with Kathleen Kelly, (pager: 206-540-8997) of the Radiation Oncology group, whose group attends each Sarcoma Conference, and spend most of the rest of the day with that group."
