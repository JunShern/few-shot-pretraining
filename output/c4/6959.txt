    "text": "I\u2019m not a big fan of most kitchen gadgets and fancy appliances. Oh sure, give me a spatula, a whisk and a standard mixer\u2014that\u2019s great. But don\u2019t ask me if I want a bread maker, a rice maker, a juicer, a breakfast sandwich maker or a toaster that can also cook your eggs 3 different ways. I really don\u2019t have space for it all in my small kitchen and I\u2019d rather just cook the eggs myself.\nAwhile back my husband brought home a food processor he won at a work party\u2014an enormous monster of a food processor\u2014and miraculously managed to find a spot to hide it in our rollaway kitchen island. Occasionally he asks me if I\u2019ve used it and I always say no. I\u2019d have to pull it out, figure out how to get it to work, clean it\u2026I reasoned it was much faster to do any necessary chopping or grating by hand.\nThen yesterday the chilly fall temperatures got me thinking about a tasty fall muffin which requires lots of grated fruits and vegetables. It\u2019s so much grating I usually end up day dreaming a roulette on line is an easy-to-play casino table game. little and grating my fingers, too. Then I suddenly remembered that food processor\u2014maybe it would be worth figuring out. It takes a lot to get the grating done by hand, but with a little bit of help, I could do it quickly (and safely).\nMeet your contacting objectives: A little preplanning with List Groups makes it easier to concentrate on each client and work list for just the right amount of time to achieve your contacting objectives.\nKeep everyone on task: The dialer doesn\u2019t get side tracked, slow down or forget to announce the next list.
