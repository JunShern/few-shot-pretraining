    "text": "Not surprisingly I don\u2019t have any cricket news for you \u2013 unless you are interested in scarifying, fertilising, or spiking the pitch, work starts early for next season!\nFINGES CROSSED \u2013 we are hoping to be able to use the Rawson for our Jumble Sale on Saturday January 18th. This is much earlier than usual as the Hall will not be useable, we assume, by the end of March. However, if it is in the hands of the new owner by January 18th we are hoping we may be allowed to use it for the last time. It is a bit of a gamble but we desperately need the funds. Please put the date in your diary and watch this space!\nI am so pleased to be able to tell you that Bolney Cricket Club are now in Div 1 of the Mid Sussex Stoner League!! The excitement went right down to the last league game at Hurstpierpoint with Bolney winning in a nail biting finish. The script couldn\u2019t have been written better for James Flower, it was his last game for the Club before moving to Leeds and he scored 104, with all of his family there to celebrate, both with him and the team. Jack Collins, ever reliable, was the other match winner taking 5 wickets for 49 runs. Many congratulations to all of the players on a brilliant season.\nNext year we have applied to the League to enter a 2nd X1 team \u2013 if we are accepted this will be our first step to providing a league team for players who don\u2019t play in the first team but would like to play league cricket and also provide a platform for our up and coming juniors. Very exciting!\nOn September 11th we held a juniors/parents/senior players match for a round robin Kwik cricket game and presentation of awards. Everyone agreed that it was fun and I think the children really enjoyed playing with parents. Thanks must go to the parents who were such good sports and joined in wholeheartedly \u2013 I think we had as many Mums as Dads playing!\nOur Winter coaching for juniors begins during the first week in October at Downlands Community College, Hassocks from 5.30 \u2013 7.00 p.m. This is a 10 week course and the cost is \u00a335. At the time of writing there is discussion regarding the day, we have booked Fridays, however some people are unable to manage that date owing to other Clubs and so Tuesdays are a possibility. Anyone who would like to take part please look out for the posters stating the day, or contact me for confirmation.\nAs this is the end of our season we would like to thank everyone who has supported the Club and helped in so many different ways, we hope you will agree that this has been Bolney\u2019s most successful season for many years, here\u2019s to 2014!\nSo far the Club has enjoyed a very successful season, and at the time of writing, the Saturday League team is 3rd in Division 2, 24 points behind 2nd place Dormansland, who we still have to play. The top two teams gain promotion to Division 1 which would be an amazing achievement to go straight through division 2 at the first attempt. Fingers crossed!\nThe Sunday team has also enjoyed their friendly games and have travelled to some lovely venues, the last of which was Parham Park, a beautiful setting for a cricket ground. Our first colt has progressed to this team, playing with his Dad, Robert, we were delighted to welcome Oliver Atkins.\nAfter a second successful summer of colts\u2019 sessions the Club is going to hold a Family Evening with an Awards Presentation on Wednesday, 11th September from 5.30 p.m. The coach, Reg, is going to organise a series of small games (culminating in a final) on the outfield that will include colts, parents and Bolney CC senior players. Anyone would be very welcome to come along and enjoy the fun, even if you are not involved with the colts.\nIn order to build on the summer coaching, and to prepare the children for junior league cricket next year, the Club has organised winter coaching from 4th October until 6th December at Downlands School, 5.30 \u2013 7.p.m. Anyone who would like to participate in this please contact the Club.\nAfter a flying start with two wins we now have to record a tie and a defeat leaving us third in Division 2 \u2013 early days yet! Jack Collins took 6 wickets against Smallfield and James Flower and Dean Hamilton scored 70 and 58 respectively against Staplefield.\nOn Sundays we have been not yet been defeated and have had some very enjoyable \u2018friendly\u2019 games. Nick Ridgway scored 60 with Andrew Bennett taking 5 wickets to secure a win against Twineham whilst Steve Bowles retired on a sparkling 104 and Nick Ridgway took 5 wickets against Forest Green.\nOur Juniors are as enthusiastic as ever and are progressing well with Reg at the helm. There will be some \u2018friendly\u2019 games planned for the end of the course.\nWe again need to thank Mark Barrow and his team at Bolney Nursery for our lovely hanging baskets again this year \u2013 they make the pavilion look so attractive and we are very grateful to Mark for the donation yet again.\nAt the time of writing we should have played ten games \u2013 due to the weather we have played six with one game abandoned at tea. However, the good news is that we have played two league games and won them both leaving us top of Div 2 with maximum 60 points \u2013 early days yet though. It is good to see Jack Collins back and taking 5 wickets in each of the league games, ably supported by Matt Stone who took 7 wickets.\nIn a friendly game against St. James Montefiore Jamie Bowles, aged 14, took 5-13 and I think that takes him into the record book. There is no sentiment for age and his Dad, Rob, had his arm twisted (by Jamie) to buy a jug \u2013 first of many!\nThe Juniors are doing well with a regular attendance of 25+ children attending. They are very enthusiastic and seem to really enjoy the sessions with Reg and the other coaches.\nThe Club will be hosting a small school\u2019s tournament on 23rd May and Bolney Primary School , where many of our juniors come from, will be taking part. It is an ideal venue with such a large ground and it will be great to see so many children taking playing cricket.\nMany thanks to everyone who supported the Jumble Sale, we made \u00a31030 profit \u2013 helped by some very generous Club members! Thanks should go to so many people, those who helped collect, those who helped sort, those who helped sell on the day, made cakes, donated jumble and last of all everyone who came along to buy. It was a great response on what was a very wet morning which had us thinking no-one would come.\nA big thank you must also go to our Vice Presidents who this year have so far donated \u00a31100! This is fantastic support from such a small community which makes everything we try to do at the Club seem very worthwhile. The Club relies on these two fund raising events to fund all expenses at the beginning of the season. This year we have been able ask Lee and Steve Jones to decorate the exterior of the pavilion and scorebox and so we are now looking very smart for the beginning of our new season in Div 2.\nOnce again we had received much support for the Junior coaching 12 week course which commences on 27th April run by Reg Perrin, in association with Chance to Shine and Sussex County Cricket Club. These sessions are very popular and Reg makes sure they are fun in a learning environment. If any late comers would like to join the course please contact the Club.\nAt the time of writing our first two weekend games have been cancelled due to the weather \u2013 let\u2019s hope this is not setting the scene for the summer!\nThe first home game will be on Saturday 13th April \u2013 weather permitting! At the beginning of the season the games are all friendlies, the first league game is 11th May against Cuckfield . All of the fixtures are on our lovely website (thank you James Staples) and it would be great to see anyone who would like to wander up to offer their support in exchange for a free cup of tea!\nCoaching for juniors will begin on Saturday 27th April 10 \u2013 12 noon for all children who are aged 7 upwards, this is not restricted to primary age and if any children, boys or girls, up to age 14 like to come along they will be very welcome. This will be for a 12 week course which will take us through the summer. The cost will be \u00a348 for the course, for families of more than one child there will be a reduction. The course will be run by Alan Perrin (Reg) who is a Sussex County Cricket Club Coach. Please contact me for application forms as soon as possible, this will give us an idea before 27th of how many children will be taking part.\nReg will be running a session on April 20th from 10 a.m. for anyone who would like to help with the coaching. This would not mean a commitment every week, just whenever people are free, but the more people we have the better for the children. On that morning Reg would present everyone with a copy of his coaching plan for the course and discuss the ideas behind various aspects of it, also he will familiarise helpers with the equipment. You do not require coaching qualifications for this as all helpers would be under the guidance of Reg.\nIf you feel able to spare an hour or two occasionally please do come along on 20th. If you would like any further information or have any questions please contact us."
