    "text": "New technologies and technological systems continually exert an ever-greater influence on our lives today. Design, Technology and Engineering and the study of designed solutions to practical problems has emerged as an absolutely essential part of a comprehensive public education. Technologies represent the real-world application of scientific principles to solve problems and increase our efficiency in the world, as well as our enjoyment of it.\nSubjects taught in the Junior school are Architectural & Engineering Drawing (Years 9 & 10), Design & Technology (Years 7-10), Robotics & Software Design (Year 10) .\nSubjects taught for the HSC are Engineering Studies, Software Design & Development and Design & Technology (Accelerated).\nYear 10 students are able to select an accelerated subject in the Industrial Arts faculty for their HSC. Design & Technology will be on offer to those students who are capable and interested in completing an accelerated HSC Course.\nOur courses provide students with exposure to pre-engineering concepts and activities in the areas of architectural and technical drawing, software design and programming, CAD, computer applications such as power point, spreadsheet, database, desktop publishing, hydraulics and structural engineering. These experiences are essential for students to form a solid foundation for post-secondary education career choices and University.\nPractical projects involve the mediums of Plastic, Wood and Metal and students design & construct a wide range of projects from Desk Caddies, Bedside Tables and Chess Board Units.\nThe format of courses encourages students to develop team and individual work habits, problem solving and critical thinking skills, pride in the production of quality products and a sense of creative achievement.\nThe Industrial Arts Department highlights the eco-friendliness, the minimal impact to the environment and the political and ethical correctness in the design and production of students\u2019 projects.\nThe Engineering Studies results have been excellent, and consolidate impressive years of exceptional results for Engineering at this school. HSC students, under the guidance of Mr R Gifford and Mr J Prorellis, have achieved 42% Band 6 results, compared to the state average of 9%. The remaining students achieve a Band 5 result.\nEngineering Studies students at Sydney High are very competent and motivated. Students enjoy the course very much, and this is reflected in the fine results achieved. Most Engineering Studies students go on to study a discipline of Engineering at various universities.\nThe Software Design & Development Course has consistently high results. Under the guidance of Ms R Dam upt to 75% of class members have achieved Band 6 results compared against a state average of 8.36 %.\nWhilst the class is often small in size, the results demonstrate high success for students who study Software Design & Development for their HSC. The current Year 12 cohort of a similar class size of eager students are well on their way to attaining another great year of HSC results.\nThis HSC course, under the instruction of Mr P Scrivener, constantly achieves Band 6 results for all the students who study it. Whilst it is a small class of carefully selected students, the results speak for themselves. These excellent results give the students a great head-start to their HSC ATAR outcomes the following year.\nGraphics Technology enables students to practice logical thought and decision-making while developing skills applicable to a range of domestic, commercial and leisure activities. They engage in both manual and computer-based forms of image generation and manipulation and develop knowledge of the wide application of graphics in a variety of contexts and an ever-increasing range of vocations. Graphics Technology also develops students\u2019 technical and visual literacy, equipping them for participation in a technological world.\nThe use of graphical images to communicate information overcomes the barriers of time and linguistic, cultural and social differences. In an age of globalised industry and rapid technological development, where computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided manufacture (CAM), interactive graphic design (IGD) and multimedia applications are widely used, the study of Graphics Technology is particularly relevant.\nThis subject gives the students an opportunity to become familiar with the processes involved in the development of software solutions. The students will learn the methodical progression involved in software development and solve problems using a creative approach.\nIn the second semester, students work in pairs to develop an autonomous rover vehicle for a Mars themed mission. The code is developed in a C based language for the Lego Mindstorms robotics platform. Students are exploring the use of actuators and sensors to complete a range of challenges including the automated detection and recovery of spheres from the lunar surface. Students will present a seminar to their peers to discuss their problem solving strategies and accomplishments. The subject also addresses the importance of teamwork and communication skills required for software programmers and analysts. The subject also provides a foundation upon which further study in this desired career path maybe undertaken for the HSC.\nThis subject is concerned with learning about a broad range of technologies through design and involves practical experiences of designing, making, evaluating, using computers, communicating and managing time & resources.\nFor the purpose of this subject, technology is the know-how and creative process that may assist people to utilise tools, resources and systems to solve problems.\nOf the allocated periods per fortnight, students spend a majority of periods in the practical rooms, two periods in the Computer Laboratories and one period in the Technical Drawing rooms.\nDue to the facilities available in this school, the main materials we use are Timber and Plastic in the construction of various projects such as a Chess Board Cabinet and bedside table. The non practical component involves the traditional and CAD drawings of the project, spreadsheet costing and management techniques.\nBoth Preliminary and HSC courses offer students knowledge, understanding and skills in aspects of engineering that include telecommunications, aeronautics, engineering mechanics/hydraulics, engineering materials, engineering electricity/electronics historical/societal influences on engineering practice and the scope of the engineering profession.\nStudents study engineering by investigating a range of applications and fields of engineering.\nThe course provides an excellent lead in to the study of engineering courses, applied science courses such as architecture, as well as design courses at tertiary level.\nSoftware Design and Development refers to the creativity, knowledge, values and communication skills required to develop computer programs. The subject provides students with a systematic approach to problem-solving, an opportunity to be creative, excellent career prospects and interesting content. Students interested in the fields of software development and computer science will find this subject of value. The subject is not only for those who seek further study or careers in this field, but also for those who wish to understand the underlying principles of software design and development.\nDesign and Technology has a unique focus on creativity, innovation and the successful implementation of innovative ideas. Students will investigate the importance of evaluation, the role of computer-based technologies, management, communication and collaborative design, as well as exploring current and emerging technologies. Students will be given the opportunity to explore and develop technologies and demonstrate insight into the future uses of technology. They will articulate arguments on issues and consequences including environmental and social impacts. They will develop skills which are transferable and which lead to lifelong learning."
