You can start with a grassroots initiative and then move on to incorporate other models.\nPilot programs are usually guided from the executive level, with senior managers handling the actual development and management activities. Pilot program models tend to be implemented at 1-4 geographically diverse, local pilot sites with unique business or hiring needs. The benefit: These simultaneous rollouts lead to lessons learned and shared best practices that can then be applied to a wider cross-section of facilities.\nA full scale rollout is characterized by a centrally coordinated initiative, typically at the corporate Human Resources and Operations levels."
