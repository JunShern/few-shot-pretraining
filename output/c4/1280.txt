    "text": "Just got back from Greenbelt \u2013 ostensibly a Christian Arts festival, but with a strong focus on justice issues, and some seriously great music and seminar speakers.\nWe arrived Friday afternoon, pitched our tent (oh yes, proper camping), and went to watch Eden Burning (reunion gig \u2013 their final gig was infront of 10,000 people at Greenbelt 97, and they reformed for a one off this weekend to celebrate this being the 30th year of Greenbelt), then saw Pierce Pettis, Iain Archer, Juliet Turner, Boo Hewerdine with Rob Jackson, Kate Rusby and Old Solar \u2013 all marvellous, and a great start to the weekend, in fact, too much great stuff to take it all in, and I missed a lot of artists that I\u2019d have to catch in other venues over the weekend. Watching that many amazing gigs in one evening does make you a bit blase about the genius on offer, but any one of the acts listed about would be worth driving 50 miles to see on an ordinary evening \u2013 Pierce I\u2019ve seen lots of times before, and played with in Reading earlier this year, Iain Archer has been getting better and better over the decade that I\u2019ve been watching him play (new album out in a few months, which promises to be a blinder), Juliet is another singer I\u2019ve been familiar with for a long time and have got both her albums, Boo Hewerdine I was more familar with as a songwriter than a singer, but he was marvellous and Rob Jackson who was guesting on guitar is a solo looper that I\u2019d had contact with before, and showed himself to be equally adept providing gorgeous pedal steel-esque guitar parts to Boo\u2019s finely crafted songs.\nOld Solar are old faves, and old friends, and played a very fine set.\nafter Dave, it was off to a Mike Riddell seminar \u2013 Mike\u2019s an author from New Zealand, and another Greenbelt fave, talking about artistic integrity and freedom \u2013 nothing new but very encouraging and helpful nonetheless.\nNext up, Martyn Joseph\u2019s songwriter\u2019s circle event, The Rising \u2013 lots of great songwriters playing their songs and discussing them. What a treat to see MJ, Juliet Turner, Pierce Pettis and Brian Houston talking about their songs and playing together. Amazing stuff.\nOther gigs \u2013 Elan (very good), Juliet Turner and Pierce Pettis (genius, obviously), Cleveland Watkiss (with Orphy Robinson on Vibes) \u2013 outstanding, joint best gig of the weekend, Calamatuer (marvellous) and Denison Witmer (another new discovery for me this weekend \u2013 fantastic singer/songwriter from Philadelphia).\nBut as always, Greenbelt is about people \u2013 meeting up with loads \u2013 hundreds \u2013 of friends, meeting loads of people I deeply admire, amazing musicians, great speakers, writers, actors, and just really nice people that I aspire to be like. Spent lots of time between gigs drinking apple tea in the tiny tea tent and enjoying the gorgeous weather.\n..and tomorrow I\u2019ll tell you about Sunday and Monday!\nSoundtrack \u2013 right now, the first mixes of the tracks I recorded with the quartet on my most recent trip to France \u2013 more on that when I\u2019ve heard them some more. Before that, Denison Witmer, \u2018Recovered\u2019 and Jaco Pastorius, \u2018Jaco Pastorius\u2019."
