It takes some convincing that he and his younger sister Amina can take care of themselves but in the end they are allowed to explore on their own. Free as a bird, they are having a great time in London. Not for long, though. One shocking event later, Malick and Amina are left stranded in the big city: no mobile phone, no money and no idea how to get back. Will Malick step up and get them out of this mess?\nThis book is part of the Arcos series of Language Learner Literature for beginners and intermediate students. With a total word count of 450 unique words (words that appear at least once in the text), among which are many cognates, it is perfect for false beginners and intermediate learners of English.\nThe book has an English-German glossary.

What types of assessment are useful, and how does the way we assess influence our take on language education?"
