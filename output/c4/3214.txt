Turning the internet ''off'' and turning back on...?\nWhat are the methods that would work?\nIf you have a dynamic IP, you can disconnect the modem, and then reconnect it and your IP will be changed.\nWhich chat room?Who banned you?You can contact the admin,and let him unbanned your account.\nTry changing the ID, if that ain't solve the problem, change your NIC.\nThey probably banned you for a reason.\nIts probably a pretty good one too.\nThat still don't explain why you were banned.\nLMAO. I got banned from MySpace so I ain't judging you. Swearing that is retarded. Only reason I don't do it much here is because that's one thing that gets you banned.\nactually it's only 24hrs ban. why need to be hurry. anyway how about use neighbor's computer with new account?\nyes proxy will help you.\nWhat are the sites for the proxys?\nI think for this you have to reade FAQ. And try to work with rules set for members. Reason of ban is important."
