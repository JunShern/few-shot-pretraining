It should prompt women everywhere to raise their own personal bars. If that happens -- if enough (if not all) women raise the bar -- it will force men to step up.\nThe women have to lead on this point -- and not settle -- in order to create the kind of shift in male/female relationships that, as this video shows, are possible.\nMen follow women. Ergo, women have the power. They need to use is responsibly, and not settle. Of course, there is a flip side to this, but that's a different discussion."
