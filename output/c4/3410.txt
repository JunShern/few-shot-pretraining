    "text": "Over the years, SEO has gone through several transformations. Starting from simple keyword targeting through to complex website optimization processes, to the ever-dynamic tactics to optimize content across multiple devices, SEO rules are ever changing.\nNevertheless, the basics like keyword-rich and consistent content, optimized links and meta tags, are still around and other crucial factors like user experience, user interface, customer journey, mobile search, voice search and social media marketing have gained prominence in getting SEO right.\nIn parallel to these changes, no space has been untouched by AI. In this feature, we delve into how AI is going to impact the future of SEO, with an eye on Google RankBrain\u2019s starring role in this transformation.\nAs new and intelligent technologies are evolving with AI at their center, SEO is witnessing more readers-centric strategies introduced by Google for better search experiences. For Google, the primary focus is always the \u2018user.\u2019 Whether it\u2019s the penalty systems or investing in semantics-savvy AI, Google takes all efforts with the sole purpose of improving content relevance for better search experience.\nIn 2016, Google launched RankBrain - \u201ca machine-learning algorithm that identifies patterns and buckets data.\u201d In an interview, Google confirmed that along with links and content, RankBrain was the third most important factor in its search ranking algorithm.\nWhat is RankBrain and its role in search?\nRankBrain is Google\u2019s one-year-old game-changing machine learning algorithm, which was introduced to augment Hummingbird (Google\u2019s overall search algorithm). Its primary aim is to help identify and interpret the searcher\u2019s intent and to show result pages that don\u2019t necessarily include the keywords that the searcher has used, while still ensuring that the content consists of information related to the query\u2019s category.\nRankBrain\u2019s job is to understand the core algorithms existing within Google and applying the best mixture of these algorithms for each type of search result. For example, for specific search results, RankBrain might find META title as the most critical signal, which can lead to a better search experience. And in other cases, it may promote PageRank as a better signal, based on the user intent. That means, RankBrain customizes every search result and uses an entirely different set of algorithms mix for every new search.\nLet me sum up how RankBrain works in the simplest of terms: as a searcher-centric AI and machine learning algorithm, RankBrain can use deep-learning to adapt and gain knowledge about the real intentions of search engine users and the kind of information they are seeking. So, if you are creating content that is useful, information-rich, unique and with the ability to engage readers, your content will surely gain, and continue to gain, RankBrains\u2019 attention.\nGone are the days when a keyword strategy was considered as the significant element of SERP. With Google\u2019s Penguin update (quality guidelines) and various other algorithms, marketers have no choice but to create quality-rich content based on searcher intent. Keyword-based SEO techniques have now paved the way for technical SEO, page-loading speed, mobile-responsiveness, user behavior, link-building tactics, content and other factors. In short, every SEO aspect focuses majorly towards building meaningful content pieces with user interface and experience at the center. However high may be your keyword density, if your content is not engaging enough with high-quality, high-relevance material, your Google ranking will start falling!\nAlso Read: Is AI the Future of Sales?\nConventional keyword phrases are pass\u00e9. RankBrain prefers natural long-tail keyword phrases, which sound like smartphone voice searches \u2013 or the real questions that searchers ask or seek. RankBrain connects the dots between the search terms and the keyword phrases to guide users to website content matching the search request. Marketers using long-tail queries as their keyword phrases get RankBrains\u2019s attention. A clear, concise and conclusive keyword strategy with primary keywords and associated long-tail phrases and queries conveying the content topic, is easily interpreted by RankBrain, leading to a highly ranked website in SERP.\nIt is now advisable to use Google AdWords Keyword Planner \u2013 a valuable tool that identifies the exact and apt keyword phrases to build relevant content. It generates a list that a marketer will find helpful to review and determine the essential vital topics around which meaningful content can be created. Using these keyword phrase suggestions provided by Google can help in understanding how the search engine links the questions. Moreover, content with Google-suggested keyword phrases will get better RankBrain ranking.\nThis is possible if you write unique, exciting and fact-based content that flows naturally and (yet strategically) with non-repetitive keywords and links that direct to complementary sources that enhance the idea and insights of the overall content. RankBrain loves content that is created keeping the user intent in mind - that the users will want to find in the websites.\nRankBrain promotes content that is thoughtfully created answering users\u2019 questions and solving their problems while leveraging a particular emotion.\nSEO is evolving each day, and AI and machine learning are adding new dimensions to what\u2019s possible with search. Google has confirmed that RankBrain is continuously being applied to an increasing number of search queries and its AI processes all the questions that Google handles \u2013 which has humongous implications for your SEO strategy. Earlier, RankBrain has reportedly handled 15% of Google\u2019s total search queries, but now it\u2019s closer to a 100%. These 4 suggestions above are a great place to start when it comes to making RankBrain love your content too!"
