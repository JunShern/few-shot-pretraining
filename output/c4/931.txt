I am experienced, fun, reliable, and always on top of things. I know how stressful planning a wedding can be. My goal is to help you in any way possible and take the stress away from the photography part. To me photography is a way of telling a story. That is why I prefer journalistic and candid approach to any photography venture. This way I am able to show a true side of my subject. Emotions and feelings are what matter most, especially on a day like a wedding day. All my wedding packages include a complimentary engagement session that comes with one 8\u00d710 print. Engagement session is a big part of writing your story. This is the time when we get to know each other. I want to show you that you can trust me and be confident that I, as a photographer and a person, am the best choice for you. On the other hand, I have a chance to see how comfortable (or not) you are in front of the camera. This determination allows me to prepare better for the wedding day and know where are your boundaries and what are your expectations. I am there for you; I am your friend; I am your problem solver; I am your Elizabeth City wedding photographer. If you have any questions, please, contact me."
