    "text": "While Los Angeles may be home for now, just one year ago I was traversing the city as a tourist, having scrupulously planned out every detail of the trip weeks in advance. Despite all of my research and preparation, I did not even consider pubic transportation as a feasible option in getting from Santa Monica to downtown to Hollywood.\nLike everyone else, I learned the hard way that traffic here is that bad, and that getting from Santa Monica to Bottega Louie on a Friday night is an absolute nightmare when you\u2019re stuck in a car.\nAccording to Anna Chen, a public communications officer for Metro, I wasn\u2019t alone in my decision to forgo the Metro rail on my trip.\n\u201cA lot of people think L.A. doesn\u2019t have a subway and they\u2019re very surprised to learn we do,\u201d said Chen.\nLos Angeles Metro\u2019s Red Line \u2014 the busiest line when in conjunction with the Purple Line \u2014 begins at Union Station and ends in North Hollywood. For the few denizens of Los Angeles that actually use the city\u2019s rail service, the Red Line is often lauded as the perfect way to get to and from some the area\u2019s most poular locales.\nTourists Troels Storm, 28, and Nina Olin, 29, were visiting Los Angeles from Denmark. During their time here they decided to take the Red Line instead of drive.\n\u201cWe do actually have a rented car, but I think traffic in L.A. is a hassle and parking is pretty expensive as well,\u201d says Storm.\nOlin agreed that taking the Red Line is easier than taking a car. \u201cWe get stressed out about finding the direction, so we find it easier to use the publication transportation,\u201d she says. While Olin does not have a difficult time figuring out the Metro system, she wishes that there were pocket-sized maps showing all the available lines.\nSimilarly, Michael Sherry, 30, uses the Red Line to commute to work. \u201cI use it probably two or three times a week, sometimes more,\u201d he said. If not the Red Line, he takes the bus.\n\u201cI think [people] probably aren\u2019t aware of how convenient [the metro] is and are so used to driving because everybody drives here,\u201d he said. \u201cI was kind of forced to [take the Red Line] because my car broke down.\u201d Even when his car is working again, Sherry plans to continue using the Metro for the most part, now that he knows what is available.\nAccording to Chen, the Red Line is also \u201ca really great way for you to travel really quickly,\u201d as it hits a lot of the major stops in downtown and provides access to a variety of trendy areas, stretching all the way to the valley.\nAndy Baptiste, 22, is a sales associate at the American Eagle in the Hollywood and Highland Center\u2019s shopping area. When he moved to Los Angeles from Georgia two years ago, he decided to leave his car in Georgia and now takes the Red Line to work every day.\n\u201cMy experience with the Red Line is good; I feel like it\u2019s reliable,\u201d said Baptiste. \u201cI haven\u2019t had any problems with it. I wish it could go further but, I\u2019m not mad at it right now.\u201d Baptiste explained that taking the Red Line to work is cheaper than driving; he gets a monthly pass for about $75, even cheaper than the cost for a similar monthly pass in Georgia.\nOn the other hand, Rashieda Lane-Smith, 39, the general manager of the Gap in the Hollywood and Highland Center, does not take the Red Line to work. She drives every day and prefers doing so. Her commute is 25-30 minutes on a good day, but she doesn\u2019t mind.\nShe used to work in San Anita and considered taking mass transit then, but still decided against it. \u201cThe line doesn\u2019t go all the way out. I would\u2019ve had to take two rail lines and a bus, and then I would still have to walk to my job,\u201d said Lane-Smith.\nAdam Guerra, 20, also prefers driving to his job at the Forever 21 in the Hollywood and Highland Center to taking the Red Line. He used to take the line until he bought a car just last month, but since buying a car, he\u2019s been driving instead.\nGuerra reveals that taking the Red Line is a shorter commute to work than driving. Despite this, the \u201cluxury\u201d of driving is worth it to him.\nChen explained that the idea of being underground dissuades some people from taking the Red Line. \u201cWe don\u2019t have Wi-Fi or cell phone service at this time underground so, for them, maybe it\u2019s a deterrent if they want to be able to use their phones while traveling,\u201d said Chen.\nOverall, however, she recommends taking the Red Line, and explained that the website is a good place to start for those who are looking to use it or are new to town.\nWhether you\u2019re a Los Angeles native raised on car culture or you\u2019re simply visiting the city for a few days, try your hand at navigating the Red Line; you\u2019ll be rewarded with an underground culture of people too cool for cars."
