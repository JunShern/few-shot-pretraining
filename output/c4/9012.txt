They propagate at the expense of the giant virus using its cytosolic reproduction and assembly machinery. Virophages encode about 20 genes including two capsid proteins, a protease that assists maturation and a FtsK-HerA type ATPase that supposedly is responsible for ATP dependent DNA transport into the assembled capsid.\nThe successful candidates will characterize capsid assembly & processing and active DNA transport of the Virophage. The assembly/-disassembly pathway will be characterized with spectroscopic, kinetic and structural methods with the aim to better understand the hierarchy and pathway of supramolecular organisation of capsid structure and what determines the exact size of assembled particles in the absence of a molecular ruler.\nKey to addressing these questions is the development and application of fluorescence based markers for FRET and Fluorescence Microscopy assays.\nThe gained knowledge will be used for recruiting in vitro assembled capsids for in vivo studies in collaboration with Matthias Fischer http://www.mpimf-heidelberg.mpg.de/14071687/gruppefischer.\nThe department has ample synchrotron beamtime at the SLS.\nSuccessful candidates have an excellent track record, high motivation, and broad scienti?c interests.
