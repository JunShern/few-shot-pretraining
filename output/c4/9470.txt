Things such as blasting your favorite holiday music, decorating with hanging string lights, running the vacuum cleaner right before the in-laws arrive, or popping a bag of popcorn before watching Elf can all overload your fuse box. This causes it to automatically shut off the flow of electricity to prevent damage or even a fire.\nSafely fix a blown fuse in no time by following these easy steps!\nAlso referred to as an electrical panel, fuse boxes can usually found in basements and garages. Knowing exactly where yours is located before a fuse blows will help you save time and the headache of trying to find it in the dark. Always keep a flashlight handy and be sure to keep this area clutter free to prevent tripping over something.\nShut of all appliances and lights in the area or room that lost power. If you added a new appliance recently, such as a new mini refrigerator or a vacuum cleaner that just might be the cause so be sure to turn off and unplug that as well. Unplugging and turning everything off helps to prevent a fuse from blowing again once it has been replaced and power is restored. Talk about annoying!\nElectrical work is serious business and is potentially dangerous, especially if you are inexperienced. Always make sure that your hands as well as the surface you are standing on are completely dry. If you feel unsure or uncomfortable working with your fuse box at any time, just give us a call and we\u2019d be glad to lend a hand!\nInspect each fuse thoroughly for signs of damage. This often includes melted metal inside the fuse or the glass window at the top of fuse may look burnt or discolored with a brown or purple hue. And just like that, you\u2019ve found your broken fuse! Replace it by unscrewing the broken fuse and replacing it with a new one that is identical in terms of amperage, size, and type. The easiest way to determine this is by taking an old or broken fuse to a hardware store to find an exact match. Keeping a few of these around can help you be prepared.\nOnce the blown fuse has been replaced, try plugging in just a few appliances and turning the lights back on. If the fuse blows again, this means the fuse simply cannot handle the electrical load you need. Moving some appliances to a different room or area may help, but calling an electrician can help you get to the root of the problem.\nWith decades of experience, you can trust the Pipes and Plugs, LLC. with all your electrical needs. Whether it\u2019s during the holiday season or any other time of year, our licensed, professional Andover, MN electricians are ready to tackle any job no matter how big or small!"
