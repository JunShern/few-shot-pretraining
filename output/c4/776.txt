Further sets of Easter shopping questions look at adding multiples of 10p, as well as finding the change from \u00a32, as a combination of Easter chicks, bunnies and eggs are bought.\nContinuing with the chocolate theme, bars of chocolate are a good way to explain simple fractions and pairs of fractions which add up to 1.\nWe complete our Easter collection with two sets of worksheets on position and co-ordinates. Children often have difficulty remembering which way round to write co-ordinates. For example (3, 4) means 3 along and 4 up. I used to remember it by saying \u2018Along the corridor and up the stairs\u2019 but there are lots of other mnemonics which can be used for this!\nRemember, all these can be freely printed and do not count as part of your 5 free sets of worksheets whilst on a trial."
