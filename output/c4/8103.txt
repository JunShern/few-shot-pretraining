Each time you play, the won item is colored in gray in the list, which makes it more likely to get the next ones!\nClick \u201cPlay\u201d to launch the game and let luck select for you an item from the chest\u2019s list!\nOnce an item is obtained, it will appear in gray in the list. As long as the grid isn\u2019t entirely gray, you can get each item only once. In that way, you won have two of the same item until it the whole grid is won!\nOnce you\u2019ve obtained all the items, you can still keep playing if you want to and get copies of them.\nImportant: if before this event you already possessed some of these items in your inventory, they won\u2019t be taken into account. The opening of the chest will allow you to get copies of them.\nFind the grids of the passed weeks!\nTo change grids, you only have to spend a few $$$. The grid will be as you left it, with the already grayed boxes. But the cost of the grid is reset, so you can play again every grid with your $$$ this time! It\u2019s your chance to take advantage of your favorite grids even more!\nThe collector\u2019s chest is available until Sunday evening at midnight.\nHave a nice week-end on OhMyDollz!"
