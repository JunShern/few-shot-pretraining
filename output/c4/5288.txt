I found a list that the Purpose Fairy put together and figured I would share-with my own flair.\nYou gotta focus on your wants\u2013 to actually sit and dwell on what you don\u2019t want is just going to bring you more of that thing you don\u2019t want. That is how the Universe works. So concentrate on your end result of WHAT YOU WANT and do not waiver.\nYou gotta know that every problem comes with a positive finish-If you do it right and consciously know that whatever problem you have, once solved, will lead to something learned?That right there will keep me in line.\nYOU ARE NOT YOUR THOUGHTS!! I have said this over and over again in this blog and now it is said once again. You are a watcher of what goes on but you are not the thoughts that go on in your head.\nGratitude, gratitude, gratitude-You gotta bathe in it, immerse yourself in it, thank everything and everyone around you for being part of your reality. You gotta be grateful for what you have in your life. It\u2019s like a snowball. The more you show gratitude, the more you will have to be grateful for.\nNo such things as coincidences and stuff\u2013 Everything that happens to you is on purpose. Whatever happens to you should not be labeled but just accepted and experienced\u2026then wait for the further good that comes into your life. We are here to thrive and the Universe is here to help.\nPerfection is futile. Striving for perfection leads to stress and frustration. Plus being perfect leaves no room for improvement and I am all about constantly improving myself.\nResistance is ludicrous. You as well as pretty much everything around us is an open system meaning that we thrive off each other. Resisting that means you will not grow. You want to grow don\u2019t you? Granted what you are enduring may not be pleasant but keeping #2 from this list in mind means that you are still growing\u2026assuming you are not resisting.\nCan you always be present? This means not worrying about anything in the past or future. Keeping in mind #3 with your thoughts that can know nothing but the past and the future as it is constantly referring to one of those two things, the present is the place to be!!\nThere was a just a few pointers the can help you live a more positive and rewarding life.\nIf there is anything you would like to add or just want to say hello, please comment below.
