I've always been a sucker for children, so anything that focused on helping children here in America or around the world is going to be very important to me, whether it's health, literacy, anything.\nI have worked with Save the Children (going to Advocacy day in DC last year, traveling with them to Guatemala, supporting them in YouTube's \"Project 4 Awesome\" and spreading the word about their Newborn Caps campaign. I've also been a part of music compilations for charities that donated their proceeds to First Book.\nI adore children and have my entire life - anything I can do to help less fortunate children means so much to me. I also used to be in a band that sang music about Harry Potter. There are quite a few bands out there doing this same thing, and together we've done a lot to promote literacy at our concerts, so First Book has always been a go-to charity for us.\nThere are always ways to help out even if you can't afford to just write a check. A huge portion of my fanbase are poor high school or college students, and I love helping them find ways to help out by other means.\nI think social responsibility is the realization that living on this planet, you're part of a team. You should want to give back and help those around you. Being in the position I am with an audience on YouTube and knowing I have a voice, I definitely feel like I am setting a good example by showing others how important it is to me.\nYes, actually. I have a lightning bolt on my right foot, and while at surface level it's just a Harry Potter reference, my involvement with the Harry Potter community and what this book has done for my life goes way deeper. It's because of Harry Potter that I became an online-based musician at all, and started touring, and making videos on YouTube. It was my involvement with Harry Potter that lead me to working with organizations like Save the Children, and I am so grateful for the positive influence those books had on my life. Cheesy as it sounds, they really have molded me into the person I am today, which is why the tattoo I have is so meaningful."
