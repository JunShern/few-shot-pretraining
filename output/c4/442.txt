This cleverly titled ebook can help with all the mishaps and beautification situations ladies find themselves in and provides quick tips to a quick fix. With helpful advice on how to revive shattered powered to how to look your very best on a budget, this book covers all bases when it comes to most frequently asked makeup questions.\nWhether you\u2019re a makeup enthusiast or just getting started, \u2018I\u2019m Not Making This Up\u2019 is an ebook for you, and I\u2019m definitely not making that up.\nThis entry was posted in Uncategorized on February 10, 2014 by natalia.\nLips are gorgeous! Nothing says love and joy like a smile or kiss! Here are some of my favourite tips for a perfect pout. Enjoy!\nTo keep lips in perfection condition, apply lip balm before bed. I actually have a toothbrush just for this purpose. After brushing teeth, use the extra toothbrush to slough off any dry skin. Apply balm. Lips will feel like new by morning.\nI love the lip balm by Burt\u2019s Bees. It is all natural and comes in a variety of formulations.\nLip Liner is great to enlarge lips or make them more symmetrical. Just remember to use a neutral hue or one that matches lipstick or gloss. The dreaded look that I call \u201cOreo Mouth\u201d (dark liner and light lipstick) is over. For added lasting power, apply to your whole lip before applying lipstick or gloss.\nI love the Outlast Lipliner by Cover Girl. The colours, texture, price as well as lasting power can\u2019t be beat!\nTo prevent lipstick from bleeding, apply powder with a q-tip just outside the lip line. It really works!\nI love Hello Flawless by Benefit. It comes in a variety of colours. This powder is so unique that you can use it dry and dust all over, or layer it on using your finger, and it works as a concealer. Great stuff!\nLip Stain is great for lasting results. I also love that you can layer it on \u2013 from sheer to opaque tones. I love the lip stain by Benefit called Benetint. It can also be used on cheeks for a 2 in 1. For best results, make sure skin is well exfoliated and moisturized. Apply stain with fingers (the warmth helps it blend) to the apples of cheeks and to lips. Using a circular, upward motion, blend well. Make sure to wash hands well after.\nClinique\u2019s Almost Lipstick is one of my favourite products on the market. It is extremely hydrating and the colour is unique to your natural lip colour. Apply a coat for a sheer result or layer on for more of a vibrant hue.\nBest Tip: Make a lipstick palette by scooping out the remnants of your lipstick from the tube. Using a clear medicine container, place remainder of lipsticks in each section. Melt in the microwave for about 30 seconds. This tip is great for mixing your lipsticks as well. Hello new hues! The clear container is perfect as you can see the colours. You can also label each section if you like.\nCarry covered straws in your purse. I love the covered ones at Starbucks, McDonald\u2019s or Tim Horton\u2019s as they are hygienic. Drinking with a straw helps lipstick last much longer.\nThis entry was posted in Uncategorized on February 1, 2014 by natalia.\nNatalia Zurawska has been a professional makeup/hair/spfx artist for the last 10 years. If you would like to see more of her work, visit her website at www.colourchameleon.com. Natalia has recently come out with a makeup e-book entitled \u201cI\u2019m Not Making This Up. It features all of the best makeup beauty tips and tricks that she has learned over the years to save you time and money. It is available on Amazon (http://astore.amazon.com/wwwcolourcham-20) as well as Smashwords (https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/379111).\nSpring is coming up and beauty products should not be ignored. Here are some great tips to keep all your makeup and hair supplies in great order as well as some great tips to save you money.\n1. When in doubt, throw it out. If it smells funny, the texture is off or you haven\u2019t used it in a year, chances are you mostly likely won\u2019t. Make a pile for makeup you rarely use and throw the rest out.\n2. Have a makeup and hair product trade party with your friends. Not only does it feel great to get rid of product, you will get product that you will use. Win-Win for all.\n3. Spray all eye shadows, and powder makeup with alcohol min 70%. Powder makeup stays intact for ages. I like to spray my powders, eye shadows and blushes every few months and clean the containers frequently. This is also a great tip if any of your powders break. Simply spray the rubbing alcohol, create a paste and leave open to dry. It will be back together!\nBest tips \u2013 if you have remnants of bronzer and powder, you can create a highlight/contour in one by crushing the powders and placing each (on either side) in a compact container. Spray with alcohol and make a paste. Allow to dry.\n4. Wash makeup brushes weekly. I wash my brushes after every use for hygiene purposes. If it is only you using them, once a week is great. Use a mild shampoo or dish detergent. I also like to use conditioner. The Tresemme Naturals collection cleans so well, smells great as well as moisturizes without any reside. Rinse well and shape. Lay flat to dry so the water doesn\u2019t run into the glue of the handle and loosen it.I love the brushes by Cover FX. The foundation brush is especially fantastic. The bristles are very dense in amount, soft and blend so well. The result is flawless.\nThere are many ways you can store your brushes. Here are just a few cute ways. Use colored sands or silica gel to match the d\u00e9cor of your room.\n5. Use a tail comb such as the one by Goody \u2013 www.goody.com to clean scraggly hair out of hair brushes weekly. Wash hairbrushes with shampoo and allow to dry.\nCleaning hair tools is easy by using alcohol wipes while the irons are hot. Swipe the alcohol wipe through a few times to get rid of any product residue.\n7. Organize makeup and hair tools. This order works well for me. Top shelf has cotton pads (I cut them in half for double the uses), q-tips, and face wash, moisturizer. Second shelf is foundation, concealer, eye shadows, blush, mascara, powder and lipsticks/glosses. The bottom shelf is medication, toothbrush and toothpaste, floss.Hair items tend to be bigger and heavier hence I like to place them at the bottom. Hair products come next and last hair tools.Keep makeup and hair tools in a cool, dry place.\n8. Regardless of how much you want to spend and how big your space is, here are some great options. Baskets also work well.\nIkea, Walmart and Target are all great places to find great stuff."
