They will look at maps and GIS data to determine potential areas of new resources. They will also use similar data to determine the potential future use of an existing mine - i.e. whether it is worth the investment to remove the remaining material or to close the mine. This is an essential role in efficient extraction of material and for determining the future viability on grounds of environmental protection and / or profitability. This is a broad role requiring a multidisciplinary approach. It is also an applied science that utilizes many geoscience technologies - new (GPS and GIS for planning) and old (maps, on-the-ground measurements, property ownership documents) and image design programs such as AutoCAD.\nIt is not just about technologies. They will need to understand mining engineering, the legal aspects such as land boundaries and state law, and even about geology itself. They need to understand the properties of rocks and deposits to find associated materials, the size of the deposit and the potential for access. Some of these require education and training rather than technology. They will also need to understand the scientific reports produced as part of the research and applied science community.\nWhere Does a Mining Surveyor Work?\nNo specific data exists for mining surveying, as this is a niche area within a specific skill set. Details referring to surveying in general (using the same knowledge base, methods and technologies) suggests that the overwhelming majority (over 70%) work in architectural and engineering services. The mix of fieldwork and office work means that they require a variety of skills related to geosciences. Few are able to spend time just in the field or just in the office, although in areas of engineering geology services that employ large teams. If the skills of an individual were one way or the other, they may find they are able to work in one environment only - for example, taking measurements and manual activity, or reading and interpreting measurements.\nThe next largest employer, with around 11% of the employees working in the surveying niche, is government. In reality for mining, the numbers may be far fewer than this. Surveyors who work for government bodies may be involved in the relation of mining facilities to public works - highways, government buildings and residential areas.\n8% work in the construction industry, fulfilling much the same roles as those in engineering services, but spend more time on private construction projects which their businesses are employed to develop.\nWhat Is the Average Mining Surveyor Salary?\nAccording to January 2016 data from PayScale, the median salary for mining surveyors was $72,858. The lowest possible salary at the same time was $55,690 and the highest was $102,326. Bonus value variation was anything up to $15k, with many roles receiving no bonus scheme. Total pay then, was anything between $58,209 and $111,179. The highest paying companies were Newmont Mining Corporation who paid close to $100,000 as a standard salary.\nUse the search box below to find all the mine surveying job listings in our job board.\nWhat Is the Job Demand for Mining Surveyors?\nBetween 2014 and 2024, demand for surveyors is expected to increase by 2%. This is 1/3 of the demand for all job types. The reason for this slow rate of growth is the advancement of new technologies that require fewer personnel to operate, are faster, more efficient and less resource intense. Students who focus on surveying technology such as AutoCAD, GIS and engineering design, will find their employability more attractive than those who do not have these skills.\nWhat Are the Education Requirements to Become a Mining Surveyor?\nHigh School students who wish to enter into a career in mining surveying should focus on the hard science subjects such as math and physics, and on geography. This will set you up well for your university degree where you should continue to focus on these subjects. Ideally, a degree related to geography or other applied science (such as geology) should be your main approach. Minors and electives should include not only math and physics, but also the relevant technologies that you will need in such a career. GIS and AutoCAD are now essential. Another option is to take one of the growing number of degrees in surveying and take math, geology, geography etc as minors and electives. Whichever degree you take, it should be ABET accredited.\nMasters degrees are preferable, especially for students intending to seek greater responsibility and project management. Only a master's can develop this greater understanding in the application of projects and applied sciences. With the job demand set to drop between now and 2024, a master's may become increasingly the expectation for graduates to enter into the field, and not an added bonus.\nA doctorate program is suitable for those who intend to enter into academia, especially college teaching. It is not vital for most jobs, unless the applicant seeks high-level advisory roles in government or at scientific institutes.\nWhat Kind Of Societies and Professional Organizations Do Mining Surveyors Have?\nMining surveyors are a small but broad niche with many practical skills. Here are some relevant professional bodies."
