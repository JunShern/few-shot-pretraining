    "text": "Grounded in the vision of equality enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, UN Women works for the elimination of discrimination against women and girls, the empowerment of women and the achievement of equality between women and men as partners and beneficiaries of development, human rights, humanitarian action and peace and security. Placing women\u2019s rights at the centre of all its efforts, UN Women\u2019s mandate is tolead and coordinate the United Nations system\u2019s efforts to ensure that commitments on gender equality and gender mainstreaming translate into action throughout the world. It also provides strong and coherent leadership in support of Member States\u2019 priorities and efforts, building effective partnerships with civil society and other relevant actors.\nUN Women\u2019s work in the area of Women\u2019s Leadership and Participation aligns with intergovernmental resolutions to promote and monitor participation in decision-making at all levels of governments, parliaments, councils and political parties, as well as women\u2019s participation and influence in other areas of civic engagement. UN Women\u2019s mandate also focuses on increasing opportunities for women\u2019s leadership in front-line service delivery.\nPNG remains one of the countries globally where women still face challenges to participate equally in political and administrative governance. This is despite the PNG Government developing and amending laws and policies to promote gender equality however, implementation has been slow. At the sub-national and local government levels also, although mandated by law; women representations on district and ward councils remains a challenge. Since the first post-independence election of 1977, PNG has never had more than three women MPs in parliament at once within any constituted legislative assembly.\nIn the Autonomous Region of Bougainville (ARB) in Papua New Guinea (PNG), UN Women has been working with demonstrable results, both the Autonomous Bougainville Government (ABG) and civil society organisations to promote women\u2019s participation in decision making and in, peace and security issues given the post-conflict context of Bougainville. In ARoB in 2015; a total of 34 women candidates contested the ABG election; making up approximately 10% of the total, the largest number of women candidates in any election.? Of these, 23 contested in the three reserved seats for women and for the first time, 11 women candidates ran in the open constituency seats. For these women, only one woman was successfully elected in the open seat.\nIn the recently concluded National General Election 2017, a record 167 women contested the elections against over 3,000 male candidates in PNG including ARoB. None of these women was successful including the three women MPS elected in 2012 NGE, who also lost their seats. Thus when the 10th Parliament sits in August, none of the 111 MPs will be female.\nThere are a number of associated factors towards women in leadership in PNG that includes; dominance of men in the political sphere, low levels of literacy, and high levels of corruption and gender-based violence. Slow legislative and policy reform to promote women leadership also remains one of the contributing factors along with limited capacity of women organisations to coordinate between other organisations to support women\u2019s leadership roles. Negative perception of women in leadership also contributes towards women\u2019s lack of electoral success in PNG and ARoB. On the other hand, while there are a good number of women leaders already present at the local and ward level, their need remains in increased skills and knowledge in areas such as literacy, public speaking, personal presentation, project planning and management, financial literacy and budgeting, computer skills, media and social media, campaigning, dialogue and listening, and community development amongst others.\nIdentify areas of collaboration with NCW, provincial/district/community governments to facilitate sub-national governance programming to address the existing gaps at this level.\nClarify institutional/governance structures and arrangements for facilitating women\u2019s engagement at subnational levels .\nIdentify organisations or individuals that could oversee, manage and support the capacity assessment, planning process and implementation.\nDraft WLP Project Design Document including Literature Review within 2 weeks of project completion (scoping study).\nFinalized Project Design Document within 1 week of return of Draft.\nDraft Concept Note using UN Women Concept Note template within 3 weeks of finalised project design document receipt (NB.
