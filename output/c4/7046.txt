    "text": "Published on October 9th 2006.\nNoise Festival, the UK\u2019s first cross media festival, launched in style last week with an event at Urbis. Young creative types from across the country have been submitting their work to Noise since February, and now this month will see the thousands of entries showcased and up for public voting.\nNoise is an arts festival with a difference. Having no physical location, the central hub of activity is the Noise website at www.noisefestival.com. The website serves as a platform to showcase the works, which cover fashion, film, music, design, architecture, written word, and are all created by up and coming creative geniuses.\nTo mark the festival going live online, Noise held a launch party last week at Urbis, with an exhibition showcasing some of the festival\u2019s highlights.\nIntroducing the event was festival organiser Denise Proctor, with speeches from design curator Wayne Hemingway and a live video link speech from MTV\u2019s Senior Vice President of Creative and Marketing International, Cristian Jofre. The event was also attended by Peter Saville, who took the opportunity to meet the artists whose work he most admired.\nThe event closed with live performances from a fantastic up and coming Manchester band International One (www.internationalone.co.uk) who have recently been in the studio recording with Phil Vinall \u2013 producer of Radiohead, Pulp and Snow Patrol, and Raxstar, the winner of BBC Radio 1\u2019s best unsigned act award in 2005.\nNoise festival is now live online at www.noisefestival.com, for the public to vote for their favourite submissions.\n\u201cAny notion of competitiveness needs to be put to one side, we need to create this platform that draws attention to new creative talent. Ultimately if only four of 4,000 submissions get the opportunity to move on and find the next stage in life through Noise then the whole project is a success\u201d said Peter Saville, graphic design curator for Noise.\nThe opening at the Urbis was the first in a series of Noise events taking place across the country throughout October."
