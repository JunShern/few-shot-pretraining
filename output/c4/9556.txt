    "text": "Furnishing International had the pleasure of attending the Export Furniture Exhibition (EFE) earlier this month, an international furniture exhibition organised by the industry, for the industry. With over 14 years of experience since its inaugural event in 2005, it truly was an event not to be missed.\nRegarded by industry experts as one of Asia\u2019s premier sourcing platforms, and a strategic gateway to beyond Asia, EFE is a regional \u2013 international furniture exhibition and an export B2B trade fair, presented by the Malaysian Furniture Council (MFC) and organized by EFE Expo Sdn Bhd, a wholly owned company of the MFC.\nWe had the opportunity to speak with many of the key players at the fair, one of which caught our particular attention \u2013 Crownlivin.\nSpeaking with Sales and Marketing Director of Crownlivin, Steven Wong he tells us that Crownlivin are a one-stop-shop for consumers. Their furnishings provide consistency throughout the home, due to their all-encompassing approach to furniture. Not only do they provide modular consoles, but they also provide the sofas and dining tables, all of which stay true to one of their five themes. According to Steven, this is what gives them their competitive edge.\nHe states that people who are looking to buy furniture want to visualise the concept before committing to purchase, which is why shopping at Crownlivin, a manufacturer who provides everything in one place, is much easier than going from store to store to buy individual pieces. He believes going from \u2018shop A to shop B, makes the concept much harder to visualise.\u2019 While Crownlivin are currently only providing furnishing solutions for living spaces, Steven tells us that they are looking to expand into studies and bedrooms at some stage this year.\nThe company is also looking to integrate smart technology within their consoles in the future, and already offers touch lighting and integrated charging docks within some of their designs.\nSteven says the benefits of exhibiting at fairs such as EFE as a manufacturer is that they can network with potential buyers as exporting is part of their sales channel for their continued growth.\nStay tuned for more exclusive interviews from the grounds of EFE in the days to come!\nFurnishing International is a proud media partner of the Export Furniture Exhibition Malaysia.\nPosted in Industry News, Talking Business and tagged business, Catherine Falalis, Crownlivin, decor, design, EFE, Exhibition, Export Furniture Exhibition, Fair, furnishing international, furniture, home, homewares, industry, industry news, interior design, living room, Malaysia, new products.
