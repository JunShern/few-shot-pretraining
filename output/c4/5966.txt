Also shown with the lucky winner, Sondra Putnam (above), and Sondra with Jeanne Patterson (left).\nHere are all the ladies from Henning First Baptist Church who attended Trout Lake Camp. Left to right: Jeanne Patterson, Mary Eidem, Clarene Nichols, Michelle Anderson, Doris Butcher, Dorothy Heschke, Ruth Tovsen, Tami Freed, Lori Smith, Jean Loge."
