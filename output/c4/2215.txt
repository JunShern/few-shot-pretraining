With an annual compounded growth rate of more than 25% across the global economy, it looks like finally ecommerce has announced its bid to stay in time. These are still early days in the year 2018 and one can expect big things to happen to the ecommerce vertical, especially the manner in which inbound marketing is leveraged shall be a key differentiator. TIS, the leading digital services consulting company in India offers an insight into these top seven inbound marketing best practices that shall enable the ecommerce vertical to leverage digitization to take the big leap after having crossed the threshold level of growth in sales and gross merchandise value.\nIn this digital era, you cannot ignore the fact that many people are visiting your website on their tablets and smartphones. If your website is not responsive or mobile friendly by now, chances are you are losing a large number of visitors. Therefore, it is always a good idea to embrace responsive design. Since I have the experience of designing many responsive websites, I would like to share ten useful tips to design excellent responsive websites.\nThe introduction of smartphones and other smart devices have shifted the internet usage from the desktop PCs to the hand-held devices. It is predicted by experts that the year 2015 will witness internet usage on smart devices to match the usage on the desktops. It means all the businesses should ensure that their company websites are compatible with these smart devices.\nRecently the Google Webmaster team on Google+ asked their followers which mobile configuration strategy they use. 81% out of the 774 votes (at the time of this writing) responded with responsive web design. 4% said dynamic serving, 7% said separate mobile URLs, and only 8% said their site is not mobile friendly.\nResponsive web design is the practice of creating websites that display evenly on all devices as the design adjusts itself automatically as per the screen size of the user i.e. whether desktop or mobile. While the Internet has brought globalization across the world, mobile growth has also picked explosive growth in the recent years taking mobile internet usage to remarkably higher levels. The growth of mobile internet usage has surpassed the use of Internet over desktop and laptops, thus forcing the developers to know about the trending term \u201cResponsive Web Design\u201d.\nAlthough there are numerous definitions of responsive web design available over internet, but I will explain here one of the most general definition of this new term.\nWith exponential germination of newer devices, varied platforms and latest desktop and mobile-specific browsers, it has become indispensable for every business owner to ensure their websites render perfectly irrespective of the device being used by the audience. With mobile browsing gaining hype everywhere, it is imperative to mould the website structure in a way that it delivers all the important information, products and news easily and effectively.\nWhy Google Recommends Responsive Website Design?\nA responsive web design responds to the various devices having different screen sizes and resolutions. According to an estimate there are more than 232 sizes of screens available, which can support website layouts such as graphics, videos and web content.\nFlexible Websites: In recent years, the use of handheld or portable devices has increased rapidly. The devices such as the smartphones, tablets and mini-laptops are frequently used by the users to access the internet adding the high amount of traffic to the websites. Therefore, there is a need to develop flexible websites, which can fit in all types of screens available in the markets. And, the responsive website designs accomplish the requirements efficiently.\nEven without statistical proofs, website designers can definitively conclude that mobile devices are the next great frontier of Internet browsing. As such, developing a business website should always take into consideration creating a responsive website design.\nThat being said, building a responsive website from scratch is not a walk in the park and even the most experienced web designing companies may not readily be able to create a responsive web platform on their own. Luckily, there are pre-existing responsive design frameworks that are readily available for use.\nResponsive web design has evolved from a trend to a necessity in web designing services. With experts predicting mobile traffic overtaking \u201cregular traffic\u201d (web traffic from desktops and laptops) by 2014 and with data showing that 90% of mobile searches result to a response to a site\u2019s call-to-action, having a site that is compatible across mobile devices is a must.\nThere are two routes that a responsive website design company can take to create websites specifically made for the mobile audience. Choosing which one you should use depends on your resources and the frequency of how your website is updated."
