This backpack is from Urban Outfitters which I actually picked up in the sale for the bargainous price of \u00a320. I\u2019m not one to carry around a lot of things with me on a daily basis \u2013 these are the main things I had. I had just bought the two Models Own nail polish featured above \u2013 Boots are currently having a 2 for \u00a38 offer on them, so now is the time to snap some up. I\u2019m looking forward to trying the Hed Kandi collaboration \u2013 a have seen it on a few friends nails and it looks fabulous.\nI always need some hand cream with me because I hate how dry my hand gets from using cheap soap at work \u2013 this works a treat. The superbalm from Liz Earle is really good for lips and any dry patches you might have \u2013 it works wonders on elbows! I am loving the new Revlon Lip Butters \u2013 I often find lipsticks really drying so this is a perfect solution.\nMy sheep keyring was from the Mark Fast goodie bag I managed to grab while I was at fashion week \u2013 I like this little dude on my keys, don\u2019t you? I just picked up this case for my phone and I love it \u2013 it made me feel like I had a whole new phone again.\nI always throw this beanie in my bag to keep my hair dry and under control in this ridiculous weather we have been having in the UK. Lastly is my purse from Zara which my mum got me at Christmas \u2013 skulls and spiky studs, pretty much me in purse form."
