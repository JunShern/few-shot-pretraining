    "text": "A host of pop, rock and country musicians have recorded the music of Elton John for two-CDs that will be released just days before the April 10 showing of the Recording Academy's salute.\nWhile a few of the performances are the same song and artist from the special, many more have entered the studio to record their takes of songs both well known and deep from the Elton John/Bernie Taupin catalog.\nThe first album, Revamp, sees a new version of \"Bennie and the Jets\" by Elton, P!nk and Logic, Ed Sheeran's \"Candle in the Wind\", Mary J. Blige's take on \"Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word\" and more from Coldplay, Sam Smith, Lady Gaga, Queens of the Stone Age, Mumford and Sons and more.\nRestoration gathers covers from country artists such as Dolly Parton, Rhonda Vincent, Rosanne Cash, Emmylou Harris, Don Henley, Vince Gill, Miranda Lambert, Chris Stapleton and Willie Nelson.\nSomehow, Miley Cyrus made it on both discs.\nElton John said \"We have two completely different albums; Revamp being the pop one and Restoration being the country one and God we have so many great artists doing our songs, it\u2019s quite incredible.\"\nHe added \"Restoration was Bernie\u2019s project and he\u2019s a huge country fan. The Revamp was more my project. He came up with an astonishing list of country performers both new and legendary. On Revamp I wrote out a wish list of people that I would love and asked them and to my surprise most of them said yes and we have quite an astonishing eclectic crew."
