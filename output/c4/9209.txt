    "text": "Ideal conditions, greeted the competitors for the Angling Trust & Canal & River Trust Stillwater Championship qualifier at the picturesque Clattercote Reservoir, near Banbury, Oxfordshire on Saturday 21st June. All that remained was for the fish to respond in numbers, which they never did, although the weights for the top three individuals were respectable, but nothing compared to what the venue can produce.\nTop rod on the day by a narrow margin was Charles Simpson from Sheffield with a weight of 29.980 kgs. Fishing the pellet waggler at distance from permanent peg 93, Charles caught 10 carp up to 5 kgs.\nIn second place on permanent peg 97, and just over a kilo behind the winner was Paul Cooke from Leicester with a weight of 28.760 kgs. Fishing a similar method to the winner, Paul landed 9 carp up 5 kgs. Third place went to Geoff Ringer from Ravensthorpe, Northampton, on permanent peg 95, with a weight of 22.060 kgs, again using the pellet waggler.\nThe three qualifiers going through to the grand final at Blythe waters on 20th September are from \u2018A\u2019 Section \u2013 Paul Knapman from Rugby with a weight of 16.880 kgs made up of 4 carp and a tench caught on paste tight to the walkway boards. \u2018B\u2019 Section \u2013 Charles Simpson 29.980 kgs, and \u2018C\u2019 Section \u2013 Jamie Hughes (Maver) from The Wirral, Merseyside with 10. 880 kgs, all silver fish (roach and hybrids) caught at 10 metres.\nThe next qualifier moves to Kiveton Waters in Sheffield on Wednesday 2nd July. There are tickets still available for this qualifier.
