    "text": "The outlet cover plate that charges everything USB - no silly hardwiring, just magic.\n18,604 backers pledged $839,301 to help bring this project to life.\nInstallation is drop-dead simple. For real. Seriously.\nEven when charging your devices, both outlets remain open and available for other uses at all times.\nWith custom-built components engineered to fit entirely inside the cover plate, it's the sleekest, most low profile charger around.\nIts slim design allows furniture to be positioned snug against the wall. The side access to the charging port enables you to plug your USB cables in with no hassle.\nIf you\u2019re picking up what we\u2019re putting down, help us by sharing SnapPower with your friends and family!\nIf you're looking for hi-res pictures, you've come to the right spot! Just click HERE. If you need to get in contact, feel free to email us at kickstarter@snappower.com.\nCan you install the SnapPower Charger upside down (with the USB port above the outlet)?\nThe SnapPower Charger is designed to work in only one orientation. The USB port is designed to be installed on the same side as the ground prongs on the outlet. For example: If the ground prongs on the outlet are facing down, the Charger will need to be installed with the USB port beneath the outlet. If the ground prongs on the outlet are facing up, then the Charger will need to be installed with the USB port above the outlet (pictured below).\nWe've spent a lot of time engineering a product that meets the highest standards of performance, durability and convenience. Our manufacture has been selected and we are gearing up for production. We learned a lot from our first Kickstarter campaign and look forward to delivering once again on time. With that being said, surprises can happen and we will be sure to always be transparent and inform our backers of potential hurdles that may come up.\nWe've finalized our production schedule and plans with experienced manufacturers to ensure that the SnapPower Charger is on schedule to deliver according to our forecast. Our team is experienced in the full spectrum of the Supply Chain process. However, unexpected shortages and delays can occur when dealing with numerous components from different suppliers. If anything does come up, we will be sure to notify our backers promptly and work quickly to resolve any issues.\nSTARTER PACK: 1 SnapPower Charger in your choice of three colors and two styles.\nSTARTER PACK PLUS: 2 SnapPower Chargers in your choice of three colors and two styles.\nROOM PACK: 3 SnapPower Chargers in your choice of three colors and two styles.\nSTARTER PACK PLUS: Two SnapPower Chargers in your choice of three colors and two styles.\nROOM PACK: Three SnapPower Chargers in your choice of three colors and two styles.\nMULTI-ROOM PACK: 5 SnapPower Chargers in your choice of three colors and two styles.\nMULTI-ROOM PACK: Five SnapPower Chargers in your choice of three colors and two styles.\nHOME PACK: 10 SnapPower Chargers in your choice of three colors and two styles.\nTo order more Chargers, just add $10 for every additional Charger you'd like.
