    "text": "Beautiful, mysterious, and unique, Cartagena's Old Town has no trouble getting attention. Its narrow streets and gorgeous architecture have made it one of Latin America\u2019s most coveted and popular destinations.\nI first heard about Cartagena when I saw the action-adventure movie Romancing the Stone back in 1984. In the film, Kathleen Turner arrived in Colombia to save her kidnapped sister and drafted Michael Douglas to help her get to Cartagena. Years later, I realized that she had mispronounced the city\u2019s name throughout the adventure. I also learned that Cartagena is quite a popular tourist destination and that no, I don\u2019t need to worry about being kidnapped there.\nWhat the movie didn't tell me was how special Cartagena really is. We didn't learn that until our weekend escape to the city for a visa run.\nOfficially known as Cartagena de Indias and named after a town in Spain, many things work together to make this Colombian city a perfect destination: delicious seafood, a rich history, lively Afro-Colombian culture, incredibly friendly locals and a nightlife that will keep you dancing to dawn.\nAnd yet, it\u2019s really the astonishing architecture that brings Cartagena together and endears it to anyone who visits it. Day or night, the gorgeous riot of color permeating the streets of the city adds an air of elegance and exuberance that makes it irresistible. Cartagena's Old Town is a walled enclave that enchants its visitors with its brightly colored houses, intricately decorated doors, and plants and vines that gracefully twine through charming wooden balconies overlooking its cobblestone streets.\nAs breathtaking as the vibrant architecture of the district is on its own, it becomes even more impressive when you take into account the history that shaped it. Throughout the city, its iconic weathered stone walls, old forts, centuries-old churches and ancient cannons poised ready for battle promise a fascinating story.\nWith the largest bay in the Caribbean, Cartagena\u2019s strategic location at the top of South America made it one of colonial Spain\u2019s three most important ports (along with Havana and San Juan). The city became an indispensable center of commerce and Spain's gateway to the precious goods that were being plundered in the newly conquered continent.\nAll this success earned unwanted attention when pirates \u2013 including Sir Francis Drake \u2013 repeatedly attacked it to ransack its wealth. In self-defense, the Spanish decided to build fortified walls around the city. They also constructed a system to control the entrance of ships in the harbor and limited the networking of streets in town. By the time everything had been completed, a century later, Cartagena had become the most protected city in South America and the Caribbean.\nWherever you go in this historic Old Town, yellow and red will dominate the streets and contrast beautifully against the azure sky that covers the sunny city throughout the year.\nStill, Cartagena\u2019s architectural charm goes far beyond its historic Old Town era. It follows the path of Colombia\u2019s history through Republican architecture and Spanish influences and finally adopts a more British style. As time progressed columns came to replace arches and bright colors made way for neutral tones. Tall, massive buildings now decorate the shoreline with the after-dark glow of hundreds of windows.\nCartagena is a city with a vivid past and an even brighter future.\nYou can find Pinterest-worthy photos sprinkled throughout this post. Save them to your travel boards for reference and inspiration.\nLooks like some really good photo opportunities. Looks like a great adventure. I always try and spot great picture opportunities when I get the chance. Sometimes we take for granted what beauties lie before us (and around us).\nTrue, Adam. It\u2019s good to be open to what our surroundings are offering.\nTo be honest, every place we\u2019ve seen in South America has been a treat (so far). I hope you get a chance to see it.\nCartagena looks absolutely gorgeous!!!! Being a UNESCO Site validated its beauty even more. Love it!\nIt\u2019s even prettier than we had expected.\nI had a flashback to Romancing the Stone, such a fun movie. But it did leave that kidnapping idea. haha What a beautiful city! Your photos reflect it\u2019s old world vibrancy. Awesome. I love history also. Would love to visit there! Thanks for sharing!\nIt\u2019s sad how a movie can leave a lasting impression about a place, and it might not even be accurate.\nVery nice! If I ever make it to Colombia, Cartagena would definitely be my first stop!\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019d like it.\nRomancing the Stone\u2026I loved that movie! I love this post, too. The pictures are gorgeous! I love all of the color, and street scenes look so inviting. Great post!\nI loved that movie too, Rob. I might even watch it again, if it\u2019s being offered on an overnight flight. It would be fun to see it from the viewpoint of having been there.\nOne of our church friends just came back from Cartagena and she couldn\u2019t stop telling us how beautiful it was. After reading your post and seeing your pictures I\u2019d very much love to go visit it myself too. I\u2019d love to photograph those buildings in the Old Town! The only problem is that I am not sure how safe Colombia is nowadays. Some people say it is, others advised us to mind our business. Whom should we believe?\nWell, I would assume that Colombia is just like any other country: Some places are perfectly safe, while others are better avoided. I had always heard that Los Angeles is a dangerous city, yet I know many people who live there and never have an issue. We certainly never felt unsafe in Cartagena.\nWe\u2019re glad you liked it, Clare.\nI love colour, and Cartagena certainly has it. It is a photographers dream to have so much vibrancy to work with.\nYou\u2019re right, Paula. It was a treat for the eyes.\nLove, love your photos of Cartagena! It is difficult to think of a more beautiful colonial city in the Americas (Old San Juan is great too). I really need to convince my husband to visit Colombia. I would like to start by visiting Bogota and Cartagena.\nWe visited Old San Juan before this website started. You are so right, \u007fboth are beautiful colonial cities. We don\u2019t know much about Bogota but we hear Medellin is a great destination.\nOmigosh! These photos are stunning. I love the dilapidation and the colors. Cartagena would definitely make me feel like a traveler. I want to go!\nLove the colours! I\u2019ve heard a lot about this city and would love to visit it someday. You\u2019ve only added to that desire. Thank you!\nCartagena is worth a visit, Michelle. I hope you enjoy it as much as we did."
