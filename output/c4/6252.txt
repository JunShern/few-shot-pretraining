Although the College strives to ensure a safe environment, each person must take ultimate responsibility for his/her own safety and that of his/her personal belongings.\nThis report includes statistics for the previous three years concerning reported crimes that occurred on-campus; and on public property within, or immediately adjacent to and accessible from the campus and off campus parking areas.\nEvery year, Alaska Career College distributes a copy of this report to students, faculty and staff via email, hard copy or via the ACC website www.AlaskaCareerCollege.edu.
