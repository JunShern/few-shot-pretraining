    "text": "Thanks to some great tips, I have come across some free online gardening and herbology courses. They could of course never replace real-life botany or herbology classes but if you don\u2019t have access to such classes, at least the online courses will provide you with a really good starting point.\nOften it is not necessary to go on a raid to Asian shops to find rare herbs or to go hiking in order to locate a special plant. Most common ailments can be treated with herbs that we already keep in our kitchen. In fact, we are often not aware of the herbal treasures we house in our cupboards. So much money can be saved by using what we already have, instead of spending it on medicine. What is more: you are not even required to have an enormous garden to grow your own herbal apothecary.\nSupermarket Herbalism: for when you don\u2019t know where to start because all that herbal information can be overwhelming!\nIf you are interested in learning more about herbs, make sure to check out some of the articles by Susun S. Weed as well, such as: Using Herbs Simply and Safely.\nA word of caution: There are actually many things you should keep in mind when getting started with herbs. People tend to forget that plants can be quite dangerous and there\u2019s always the possibility that you have allergies you were not aware of. Finally, when you\u2019ve made sure you\u2019re using the correct herb in the correct way, remember that for some ailments you will still be required to see a doctor.\nI just have to say how grateful I am to the wonderful people who teach any paganism-related course free of charge! It is actually amazing and most admirable that so many people are doing this; they willingly lend their time and energy to share and teach the things they\u2019ve learned without expecting anything in return! Big thumbs-up for all of you! I deeply appreciate these efforts and I hope to give something back by sharing my own journey through this blog and through my new podcast."
