    "text": "Before traveling to Egypt, you should first check and see whether you are eligible for an Egypt visa on arrival or an Egypt e-visa. Even though both visa types have the same purpose, both allow yoo to enter Egypt legally, by applying for an Egypt e-Visa you save more time than when you issue a Visa on Arrival, which means you will get to make the most out of your time in Egypt. More information about both types of visas is detailed below.\nThere are 41 countries whose citizens are eligible for an Egypt visa on arrival: the 27 states in the European Union, Australia, Canada, Georgia, Japan, South Korea, Macedonia, Malaysia, New Zealand, Norway, Russia, Serbia, Ukraine, the United Kingdom and the United States. As long as you are a citizen of one of the states mentioned above, your work is cut out for you.\nLike its name suggests, a visa on arrival is issued when the traveler arrives in Egypt. Once you land, you need to go to the visa on arrival window, but you need to do so before getting in the queue at the immigration office. Once you reach the window, you need to pay 25 USD, and you will be given a visa sticker. Stick it to a blank page of your passport, and you are good for immigration.\nKeep in mind, however, that when you pay for your Egypt visa on arrival, you need to pay in US dollars precisely. You are not allowed to use any other currency, and it is preferable if you have the exact amount. Also, you need to pay in cash because credit or debit cards are not accepted.\nAn e-Visa is a document type visa that arrives via e-mail in PDF format that will also be electronically attached to your passport. It is very simple to obtain and has a much easier and practical issuing procedure than the visa on arrival. The cost of an e-Visa is 25 USD, the same as a visa on arrival,and you can apply online by yourself anytime and anywhere. However, filling out online applications for visas can be tricky and risky since there are no refunds in case there's a mistake in the application and you will have to start over with the whole process in case this happens. Fortunately, iVisa can help you with the application process for a fee of 25 USD which can vary depending on how fast you want to obtain your e-Visa.\nThere are 46 countries whose citizens can get an Egypt e-visa, and in order to find out whether you are eligible or not, just access iVisa.com, click on the Visa Checker tool (upper right corner), enter your nationality and Egypt as a destination, and voila! The information will unfold right in front of you.\nGetting an Egypt e-visa requires an application. You need to complete an online form with all the required information, upload some documents, and make the payment. Once you hit submit, iVisa will send your application to the visa issuing authority. All that is left for you to do is wait for your visa to arrive in the timeframe of your choosing and you'll be all set for your trip to Egypt.\nBy applying for an e-Visa instead of a Visa on Arrival you will not only save time but also, by using iVisa services, you will be much less stressed about your application process and your visa being denied since you will have a group of experts taking care of your application."
