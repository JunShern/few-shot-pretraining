Liz files for her Social Security retirement benefit of $2,400 per month at full retirement age, which is age 66, based on her own earnings record. But her husband Tim wants to wait until age 70 to file.\nbenefit amount, which is$1,200 per month. He then delays applying for benefits based on his own earnings record so that he can earn delayed retirement credits. At age 70, Tim switches from collecting a spousal benefit to his own larger worker\u2019s retirement benefit of $2,772 per month. This is 32% higher than it would have been if he\u2019d started taking his benefits at age 66. This strategy not only increases Liz and Tim\u2019s household income, but also enables Liz to receive a larger survivor\u2019s benefit in the event of Tim\u2019s death. Contact us for an illustration of how this might work for you."
