I'd love to know! Share in the comments below.\nthanks for posting this list! i have a 10th grader this fall who is an absolutely great reader, but he is totally unimpressed by \"classical literature\". he finds pretty much everything completely boring and dull, even if he's able to pick the title himself. i wish there was a way to make it more exciting \u2013 any ideas??? when i was his age, i remember thinking that Hemingway was so dull, i couldn't believe he was a celebrated author.\nThanks for sharing your list. I need to figure out what my 10th grader will read. I think the 7 Habits of Highly Effective Teens and probably The Hiding Place. Beyond that\u2026 I'm still trying to compile.\nI think Catcher in the Rye by JD Salinger is a good choice for a tenth grader. I remember reading it and it was great."
