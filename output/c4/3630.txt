    "text": "Lake Suchitlan is shared by four departments in the northern and central part of El Salvador. The quickest way to get to the lake is through the colonial town of Suchitoto.\nThe lake was formed during the winter of 1976, after the Power Generating Dam Cerr\u00f3n Grande was built. Its name comes from the hacienda located on the rim of the Lempa River.\nDifferent kinds of fish can be found here, most of them being artificially introduced. Among its fauna we can find: rabbits, pichiches, zarzetas, grass turtles, etc.\nThe extension of the lake varies according to the season; during winter it reaches 135 km. Its elevation also differs, when in summer reaches 182 m ASL, and in winter 234 m ASL, being this last one when it reaches 2150 million cubic meters of water.\nAlejandro Coto a famous local film maker gave the lake its current name \"Suchitlan\", which in nahuatl means \"Place of the flower-bird\"."
