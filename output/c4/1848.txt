    "text": "Beverly Hills is sidestepping traditional media marketing with a thought leadership trend piece on the future of luxury, which helps position both the destination and the bureau as fresh and forward-thinking.\nWhen a tourism bureau produces its own thought leadership around a theme aligned with the city\u2019s value proposition, it accomplishes a number of things.\nOne, the intelligence is a marketing piece in itself, promoting both the destination and the DMO\u2019s leadership in a fresh way with actionable takeaways.\nTwo, it engages the local destination partners in an elevated discussion around important travel trends and consumer behavior.\nThree, its educates local government and business stakeholders, who can often use the research for their own purposes, which further supports the bureau\u2019s case for funding.\nThis week, the Beverly Hills Conference & Visitors Bureau launched \u201cThe Future of Luxury\u201d trend report. The overarching goal is to show how Beverly Hills is an iconic luxury travel brand that\u2019s attuned and evolving with next generation luxury travel trends.\nThe report identifies 10 key luxury destinations worldwide, spanning from Los Angeles to Zurich to Hong Kong, based on their population of \u201cultra high net worth individuals\u201d (UHNWIs). Each city description shows demographic data, spending patterns for high-net locals, and what\u2019s trending in terms of general interest in the luxury marketplace.\nFor example, 74% of Singaporeans with over $1 million in moveable assets prefer to research luxury products online but they prefer to buy in-store. Also, mainland Chinese consumers define watches, bags and jewelry as their \u201cmost interesting\u201d luxury purchases, while Hong Kong residents prioritize luxury travel. In New York, retail spending is shifting as more consumers are purchasing lifestyle experiences for gifts, such as spa treatments and theater events.\nThe rest of trend report focuses on what it defines at \u201cLuxury 2.0,\u201d revolving around the digitization of the travel and shopping experience, and \u201cLuxury 3.0,\u201d which refers to the rise of brand experiences and experiential marketing.\nAs an example given for this \u201cdigitization of exclusivity,\u201d Oscar de la Renta debuted its fall campaign on Instagram weeks before buying print placements in Vogue. Burberry hired celebrity photographer Mario Testino to shoot the first-ever fashion launch for Snapchat.\nThe Luxury 3.0 section explains how fashion labels are serial innovators and \u201cretail is becoming as much a communication channel as a shopping experience.\u201d Pop-up stores, cross-industry partnerships, and live programming streamed online are becoming a regular thing to engage high-income Gen Y audiences.\nPresently, The Future of Luxury trend report is only available for download on an unmarked Beverly Hills CVB website page that requires a passcode. The report was developed primarily for the destination partners, but anyone can request a copy of the report, although that isn\u2019t made clear on the site.\nWe\u2019re told that the report will be made publicly available on the CVB website in a couple of weeks. For now, request a password at: media@lovebeverlyhills.com.\nThe Beverly Hills CVB\u2019s annual budget is minuscule at only $4 million because there\u2019s only a small number of properties paying into the bed tax. This report provides added marketing muscle for the money, and other bureaus should be doing something similar."
