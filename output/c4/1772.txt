    "text": "Overview: No Blues is an indie record from an indie band who have been around the block. Los Campesinos! are established songwriters, and it shows. These tracks are carefully crafted indie rock concoctions. Guitar and bass provide the heart of the sound, but it\u2019s the vocals that provide the soul. The lead vocalist is flamboyant and passionate with his delivery, but never too over the top. The band provides nice choral backing vocals that add a lot of color to the sound. There is something amiss on No Blues, though, because these songs sure do seem to blend together. Part of the blame is on the production job; this album is simply mixed and produced very poorly, causing the songwriting to take less effect. The other part of the blame needs to be put on the songwriting, though. This is too safe. The sound has been done many times before and they just don\u2019t include enough ideas into each track. This album was more appealing at first, but the allure fades quickly.\nCan you please review RDGLDGRN\u2019s debut album.\nNo Blues? Listen to the lyrics guys, the last song\u2019s about throwing yourself off a bridge! Just don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re talking about with the production at all, sounds pretty well defined and layered well enough tbh. Wish you\u2019d talk about the songs more, not everyone really cares about production (you may be right about it, I probably dont hear it as I like it so much) as much as how good some of the tunes are.\nI think you guys would really get into some of their earlier work. They have some very creative and playful lyrics. This didn\u2019t really do too much for me either. Love the cover art/general vibe they\u2019re trying to go for though. I just didn\u2019t find the songs all that memorable or catchy.\nguys thank you for reviewing this album. i personally did not enjoy No Blues upon first listen, but after sitting down with it i grew to love it. production never seemed to bother me since this is an indie rock album & i knew what i was going to get coming into it. Now do i agree that they\u2019re some stinkers on No Blues, but tracks like \u201cFor Flotsam\u201d, \u201cCemetery Gaits\u201d, \u201cAvocado, Baby\u201d, \u201cLet It Spill\u201d & and one of my favorite tracks of the year \u201cWhat Death Leaves Behind\u201d more than make of for them. Oh & one last thing\u2026 PLEASE REVIEW CHILDISH GAMBINO\u2019S NEW ALBUM. i\u2019d like to see your takes on what i believe will be will end up being my hip hop album of the year.\narghh how did I miss this going out? I love LC!\nI really liked this album and the production didn\u2019t really bother me, perhaps because I have really liked this band for a long time. I have the lyric book that was available with the pre-order of the album and it made me more aware of the message of the songs but then perhaps thats a sign of the level of production of the album in that I actually had to go read what was actually being sung. What I really like is how awash this is with football(soccer) references and that they actually work! I\u2019ve rarely seen sport references translate into music without a general feeling of naffness.\nI would have to side with Tom on this one, I think a lot of the songs on this album are very strong and make up for the things that don\u2019t quite work here.\nI\u2019m not sure if you guys picked this one because of past nagging to review one of their previous albums or not but the last one record I suggested you review was the \u201cTwilight Sad\u201d which also had a split opinion. Rest assured I\u2019m working hard on finding the next divisive record.\nThis is one of my favourite albums of the year. I love the lyrics, the production doesn\u2019t bother me much.\nWaaay too much production talk here. I think you could\u2019ve stated your case on that in a sentence or two."
