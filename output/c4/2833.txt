    "text": "Posted November 7, 2011 at 11:44 pm in VVVVVV, VVVVVV Levels.\nWhirligig\u2019s CCCCCCCCCC is an incredibly cool little game that you should definitely check out if you haven\u2019t already played it \u2013 Whirligig bills it as a demake-slash-sequel to VVVVVV, but really, it\u2019s very much its own thing with its own ideas.\nCCCCCCCCCC Retold is a re-imagining of that game as a VVVVVV level. I was expecting a pretty straight conversion, but it\u2019s actually very different \u2013 while lots of the basic structural ideas remain (the story, the zones), the content itself is all new. It\u2019s huge too \u2013 probably the biggest player level since Dimension 333333.\nIn places it\u2019s way too tough for it\u2019s own good \u2013 one of its 10 stages is a mandatory Vini Vidi Vici style challenge \u2013 but on the whole, the difficulty is pretty reasonable \u2013 easier overall than some other levels I\u2019ve featured.\nPosted September 21, 2011 at 12:25 pm in VVVVVV, VVVVVV Levels.\nThis short level is lots of fun and extremely polished (which is no surprise considering it\u2019s by the animator who made this). Loved the writing in this one too.\nHere\u2019s another level that uses trinkets as keys! I really loved the structure of the main hub in this one, and the style of using the bright neon pink lab tileset for each room.\nLike \u201cDevious Dimentions\u201d in the previous post, this level is set in a very constrained world \u2013 but it takes the concept further than that level did, with lots of warping rooms and heavy use of screen edge warp lines.\nThis is actually one of the first custom levels posted to the forum, and the first level I saw to do the whole roomtext as roomnames thing. Although it\u2019s a bit hard (impossible?) in places, it\u2019s a dimension that\u2019s a lot of fun to explore thanks to its attention to detail and very open structure.\nPosted September 11, 2011 at 10:16 pm in VVVVVV, VVVVVV Levels.\nSo, I\u2019ve decided to do a few roundup posts to highlight a few other levels I really liked, which you\u2019ve probably missed unless you\u2019ve been reading my forum!\nThese levels are a little rough around the edges compared to other levels that I\u2019ve featured \u2013 some are glitchy, some are really hard, some are unpolished \u2013 but I think they\u2019re all levels that fans of VVVVVV will enjoy a lot. There are 15 in all; here are the first five!\nThis is a great little level that has a bit of a Manic Miner feel. It makes some pretty fantastic use of roomtext.\nReactor Disaster is a fairly large level with a lot of scripting. It\u2019s quite hard, but very polished, and it has a lot of interesting challenges.\nOn the other end of the scale, PJBottom\u2019z Mirror rorriM has no challenges at all; no spikes and no enemies. I liked it for its simplicity and singular focus.\nI found Castle Darkdeath utterly charming; it has some incredibly rough edges, but also some really imaginative challenges.\nThe RYB maze I like because it\u2019s so different from other VVVVVV levels \u2013 I found it really got interesting for me when I got as far as the room titled \u201cThe Bouncy, much much better edition\u201d. I recommend sticking with it, even if you\u2019re finding it a little confusing at the start!\nYou can get all five levels from the download below. I\u2019ll post the other 10 over the next week!\nPosted August 27, 2011 at 6:39 pm in VVVVVV, VVVVVV Levels.\n\u201cRescuing Violet\u201d by Stalefish is a very well made level \u2013 it\u2019s not too hard (though some of the trinkets are a bit tricky), it\u2019s got some imaginative challenges (I really liked the room \u201cFrogger\u201d in particular), and it pays a lot of attention to little details. Also, it does that cool thing I\u2019ve seen few times now of using the Room Text tool to place rooms names in the room itself.\nPosted August 19, 2011 at 5:10 pm in VVVVVV, VVVVVV Levels.\nHere\u2019s a short one that I really liked: Noyb\u2019s \u201cVictuals\u201c! He\u2019s not the first person to make a pure story level in VVVVVV, but this one\u2019s my favourite so far."
