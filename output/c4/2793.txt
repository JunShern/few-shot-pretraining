    "text": "It's been a long time since this blog of mine has seen any action, but with some renewed (or possibly new entirely?) motivation behind me, I'm back!\nOver that past several weeks (months? Maybe months) I've been taking a hard look at where my life is going, and I realized that I didn't have a clear idea of where I even wanted it to be going, let alone it's actual trajectory. So after over 10 years of daily training for cross country skiing, I decided I would take a little break, just to see what would happen. And the result was amazing.\nIn my step back from my usual endurance training, I realized that fitness and health is more than just a hobby to be, but a passion that I want to pursue for the rest of my life. Over the past decade, that passion was ski racing and I loved it (and still do!). The amazing sport, the breath-taking places that it took me around the world, the fantastic people, all of it. But what I've realized this past month is what was missing from that, and that was my other passion of helping people. From a young age I've always taken an immense amount of pride in helping others in any way I can (some might even say annoyingly so :p). The feeling of enabling someone to do something they either otherwise coudn't do, or just thought they couldn't do, is quite frankly the best feeling in the world to me. So this past month, with the help of an amazing team of coaches, I've found a community that I can be a part of and combine my passion for fitness and health with my passion for helping others!\nBut before I can help others with any healthy lifestyle and fitness goals of theirs, I needed to address some of my own so that I can be a as inspirational for others as I can, not to mention improving my own health and well-being. So a couple weeks ago I got my hands on a new workout and nutrition plan that would help me get my energy levels up to where I want them to be, keep me as fit and lean as I want to be, and most importantly, TAKE PRIDE IN BEING ME! And I am almost overwhelmed by the difference this had made in my life. I'm back to getting up early, being productive throughout my whole day, and doing these things that I've always liked to do! If I've learned anything from this experience so far, it's that your health is worth investing in. I've seen a lot of quotes over the years saying things like 'You only get one life, so you might as well make the best of it,' but it's taken until now for me to really understand the gravity of that statement. If there is something you want to do, more than what you're doing now, why wait? Just find a path that could lead you there, and starting running! (I mean that figuratively, for the most part :p).\nThat's about all I've got for now, but I can't wait to see where this journey of mine takes me, and to share it all with those who want to join me!\nHealthy body -> Healthy mind -> Happy life!"
