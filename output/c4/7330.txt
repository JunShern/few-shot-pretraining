    "text": "Halo 5 Guardians is gearing up to launch its biggest new update titled the Warzone Firefight.\nThe pack is slated to be rolled out before the end of this month.\nWith just days to go, the developers of the game 343 industries released some teaser images to keep gamers interested on what they have to offer. An actual release date for the update is not known yet as they like to maintain the suspense until the last moment. The PvE mode is the most anticipated addition in the Warzone Firefight.\nThe new mode is unique in its own way and a combination of two different Halo games. Some of the elements are borrowed from the Warzone mode in Halo 5 Guardians while the rest is inspired by the Halo 3 ODST Firefight. Bringing the best of both worlds, 343 industries have come up with the Warzone Firefight mode. The big update is going to allow players to experience all-new maps combined with a new Campaign Score Attack mode. Probably, the name is self-suggestive whichis a mix of the missions completed in the campaign and earning a score out of it to beat your opponent.\nIt\u2019s more of a speculation than an actual announcement made by the publisher yet. No update is complete without new weapons. The Warzone Firefight will include new weapons to make use of intense combat, achievements to be unlocked, brand new vehicles to scale the large maps and armor which should help you stay alive longer in firefights. A brand new canvas for the Halo 5 forge toolkit is bundled with it.\nThe developers of the game 343 industries have released a screenshot of one of the maps which will soon be available in Halo 5 Guardians Warzone Firefight mode. The map is set in a mining facility which has plenty of great positions for the snipers to make use of. Some trench locations should help support the team as they progress forward. It is equally split into multiple regions so that there is scope for both close range combat as well as long sniping shots. You can find an image of the map provided below.\nAnother map is named Tidal set in a coastal location and is the Forge Canvas. Halo 5 Guardians received the Hog Wild update which is the last big thing that happened to the game. Now, it\u2019s time to get ready for the Warzone Firefight."
