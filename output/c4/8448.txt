    "text": "Seasonal allergies impact millions of people and can be experienced seasonally at the onset of spring or autumn, during the summer, or even in the winter. Conversely, they can be chronic allergies with symptoms that last all year. Allergies can be triggered by a range of allergens, such as dust, mold, pollen, food, dander, insect bites, specific materials. They are often associated with inflammation, itching, and redness, sneezing, coughing, congestion, runny nose, itchy and watery eyes, headaches, nausea, dizziness, and difficulty breathing. Allergies may also be experienced topically in the form of hives, eczema, or dermatitis.\nAlthough allergies do not have any cures, there are ways to help keep their symptoms under control, and Essential Oils may offer respite when used to complement traditional allergy treatments. Essential Oils can be valuable year-round, not only for their scents \u2013 especially those with bright, cheerful, and invigorating fragrances \u2013 but also for the anti-bacterial property that many are reputed to exhibit, which helps to facilitate recovery from seasonal complaints. Furthermore, many of them are known to help ease stiffness, body aches, and spasms that may arise.\nPopular Essential Oils for seasonal allergies include citrus oils, which have calming scents that are said to have mood-boosting and uplifting effects on the mind, thus helping to decrease the sense of emotional stress that comes with physical suffering. Oils with cooling qualities, such as Eucalyptus and Peppermint, are commonly used to address other common symptoms of allergies, as they have clarifying, expectorant, energizing, anti-bacterial, and anti-inflammatory qualities that are reputed to reduce respiratory discomforts and body aches.\nBreathe Easy Synergy Blend: Made up of Ravensara, Eucalyptus, Lemon, Laurel Leaf, Peppermint, and Cardamom oils.\nImmunity Synergy Blend: Made up of Orange, Lemon, Tea Tree, Rosemary, Frankincense, and Eucalyptus oils.\nInvigorating Synergy Blend: Made up of Rosemary, Juniper Berry, Lemongrass, Nutmeg, Fir Balsam, Pepper Black, and Lemon oils.\nVitality Synergy Blend: Made up of Lavender, Lemongrass, Mandarin, Patchouli, Geranium Egypt, Ylang Ylang, and Juniper Berry oils.\nRelax Synergy Blend: Made up of Blood Orange, Bergamot, Grapefruit, Patchouli, and Ylang Ylang oils.\nSeveral, if not all, of the oils in these lists are known to improve the mood, promote rest and easy breathing, eliminate allergy-inducing bacteria, as well as comfort aches, inflammation, and irritation. They can be diffused, diluted in a warm bath, used to make a room or fabric freshener, incorporated into a candle formulation, applied as a roll-on personal scent or body spray, or be added to a massage oil blend, among various other applications.\nTo create a small roll-on blend, start by selecting a small number of oils to combine, such as 3 Essential Oils, and 1 Carrier Oil in which to dilute them. For a 10 ml roller bottle, simply add 2 drops of each chosen Essential Oil to the vial and fill the rest of it with the Carrier Oil. Next, cap the bottle and shake it well to ensure that all the oils have been thoroughly combined. To use it, simply stamp or roll a small amount of the blend onto the preferred area of skin, such as the wrist, and allow the fragrance to naturally waft.\nTo create an oil blend that can also help to target allergy symptoms, consider adding one or several of the abovementioned essential oils to a diffuser blend, roll-on blend, scented bath, or any other application method; however, it is recommended that massages be avoided during an illness, as they are reputed to increase the likelihood of the symptoms becoming aggravated.\nTo create a Spring Massage Blend, use any of the abovementioned Essential Oils, which are uplifting, refreshing, and immune-enhancing. A recommended dilution is 3-6 drops of a preferred Essential Oil or Essential Oil Blend in 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of a preferred Carrier Oil. A recipe for a full-body massage could take 3 tablespoons or more, subject to the area of skin being massaged as well as the length of the massage. To enhance the soothing quality of the personalized Massage Blend, consider including Essential Oils that have distinctively soft, sedative, reassuring fragrances: Bergamot, Chamomile, Geranium, Helichrysum, Lavender, Neroli, Sweet Basil, and Ylang Ylang.\nAs with all other New Directions Aromatics products, Essential Oils are for external use only. It is imperative to consult a medical practitioner before using these oils for therapeutic purposes. Pregnant and nursing women are especially advised not to use Essential Oils without the medical advice of a physician, as they may have effects on certain hormone secretions and it is unclear whether these effects are transferable to babies at these stages of development. These oils should always be stored in an area that is inaccessible to children, especially those under the age of 7.\nThose with the following health conditions are especially recommended to be advised by a physician: cancer, heart-related ailments, skin disorders or allergies, hormone-related ailments, or epilepsy. Individuals that are taking prescription drugs, undergoing major surgery, or who are at a greater risk of experiencing strokes, heart attacks, or atherosclerosis are also advised to seek medical consultation prior to use.\nPrior to using any Essential Oil, a skin test is recommended. This can be done by diluting 1 drop of the Essential Oil in 4 drops of a Carrier Oil and applying a dime-size amount of this blend to a small area of skin that is not sensitive. Essential Oils must never be used near the eyes, inner nose, and ears, or on any other particularly sensitive areas of skin. Potential side effects of Essential Oils include redness, rash, hives, burning, bleeding disorders, decreased speed of healing, low blood pressure, dizziness, headache, nausea, diarrhea, convulsions, and rapid heartbeat. In the event of an allergic reaction, discontinue use of the products and see a doctor, pharmacist, or allergist immediately for a health assessment and appropriate remedial action. To prevent side effects, consult with a medical professional prior to use.\nEase the body and uplift the mind with NDA\u2019s most popular warming Essential Oils and Synergy Blends.
