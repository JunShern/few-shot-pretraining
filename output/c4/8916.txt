Truly, they should both come around more often.\nI haven't laughed so hard in quite a while. Good grief. Several of us have had a lot of fun with this and I will spare y'all some of our comments.\nOur principal was standing right outside the lab doors. And it wasn't even Friday!\nI've heard of prancercise, but honestly thought it was an SNL skit or something. Is it a real thing? She looked serious. And ridiculous. But in a way...I wonder if there is something freeing about running around, waving your arms. The kids in the other video seemed to think so. Anyway - it's good for a laugh, that's for sure!\nI want to know if I get a pair of the blue leopard spotted (??) tights with Prancercise membership. I don't you can buy those anymore and someday I want to be a big hit at the retirement home.\nLooks good for the kids.\nPrancercise your long weekend and enjoy!\nToo funny. I did try a bit of prancing too.\nMy grandchildren don't even start school until next week. Hopefully their teachers aren't already stressed out because they went back yesterday."
