    "text": "We are passionate about introducing children to the countryside, and believe that the younger children come to love being outside, the more likely they will be to care about the environment as they grow up. Our Big Owls started with graduates from Little Owls, and runs periodically in the holidays and at weekends.\nAs with Little Owls, we head outside for at least half of every session, and our activities are seasonally focused, for example hunting for frogs in late winter, minibeasting in the summer, harvesting vegetables in the autumn, following a snowflake trail in the woods in the winter. Arts and crafts activities and stories or poems complement each session, as do themed cookies from our kitchen!\nIt's feeding time down on the farm. Come and help us around the farm for a fun and busy hour of feeding! Our goats, sheep, chickens, pigs and all our animals can't wait to see you!\nCome and join us to go hunting for minibeasts. Underground, under logs and stones! Come and have a dig and search for the smallest creatures on our farm!\nParents, grandparents and carers enjoy their time with us too, and all activities are lead by experienced staff.\nMany children stay with us for two years, so book early to make sure of a place! School holidays and occasional weekends, 10.00 - 12.00 or 1.00 - 3.00."
