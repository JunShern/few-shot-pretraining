    "text": "I love your site I have purchased three of your Technology series. I noticed [in the K-6 textbooks] you talk about using protopage \u2013 how do you let your students use it without them doing anything to what is on the page.\nA: I love my protopage internet start page. I don\u2019t mind if my students (I teach K-8) edit the page (within reason). I was worried at first so I put blocks there specifically for comments, wall writing, doodling. I tried Wall Wisher, which didn\u2019t work well. I added a hamster and a pet dog that students can play with, feed, virtually cuddle. In some of the widgets (such as the calculator), the skins can be changed. That\u2019s fine. I like that students personalize their stations even though the next class in 45 minutes might make changes. If they take ownership of the computer, they\u2019ll take better care of it and enjoy the class more. I used to let them add wallpapers until the IT department locked us out.\nThat said, to do any serious formatting requires a log in as Admin (like to add widgets or change the colors). That\u2019s reserved for me. Also, I don\u2019t give students much time to play. We\u2019re busy. They have to come in during recess or lunch to have a block of time. I have more problems with them futzing with the icons on the desktop and turning the screen on its side than fooling around with the start page. Techie kids are a precocious bunch!\nMy suggestion if you\u2019re thinking of using Protopage: Don\u2019t worry about formatting. It\u2019ll likely work out fine.\nJacqui Murray is the editor of a technology curriculum for K-8th grade and author of two technology training books for middle school.
