    "text": "Jake is a gorgeous, talkative, fun and energetic female blue parakeet looking for a loving guardian.\nJake flew into the backyard of a family in Chicago and landed on a man's shoulder. His children named the bird Jake, but they decided not to keep the bird themselves, so I took her in.\nI'm pretty sure this bird is a female based on the color of her feet, and the color of her cere (the \"bump\" above her beak). I understand that Parakeets can live 20 years, so acquiring a bird, like any pet, should not be taken lightly.\nPersonally, I love having a bird around. I've had a rescued Cockatiel for many years and she alerts me to someone coming to the door - before my dogs! They are intelligent, interactive and fun.\nFeel free to read up on Parakeet care before taking the plunge. Here are a couple articles that I found interesting.\nIf you'd like to meet and possibly adopt Jake, please contact me directly at sheri@petraits.com or 773-777-2891. Her adoption fee is $25, or $50 if you'd also like her cage, food, toys and treats. She's being fostered in Chicago's Andersonville neighborhood."
