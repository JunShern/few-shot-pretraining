    "text": "Confused, what plasma should I buy with \u00a31500?\nDiscussion in 'Plasma TVs Forum' started by krissb, Dec 26, 2006.\nI've been doing a fair amount of research recently and I would say you have a choice of 2.\n1. The Panny TH42-PX600, this has 3 HDMI connections, which will be enough for your needs.\n2. The Pioneer PDP-427XD, this has 2 HDMI connections and a component, so again enough for your needs.\nBoth of these panels can be had for less than \u00a31500 if you shop around.\nDo some searching and come up with your own conclusions, but I feel you too will whittle the panels down to these two.\nThe Panny apparently has issues with purple snaking and the Pioneer apparently has issues with HDMI connectivity to a SKY HD box So read up well.\nHi, I like the look of the Panasonic TH50PX60. A full 50\" monster, that can be had for just under \u00a31600 if you look around (www.pricerunner .co.uk).\nPersonally I'd stay clear of the panny's if you've got a 360 some people have had some nasty looking green tinge with them Not all but some. I'm looking at plasmas and it has to be the pio for me, so far I haven't heard of any major issues with it. There are a lot coming through with the pannys but that could just be because more people have them.\nTry and find a plasma tv that hasn't had issues with it.\nPanny and Pio are my choices to look at. I did end up with a Panny, but thats only because a friend of mine owns a Retail outlet and always does me a fantastic deal.\nAt the end of the day, they all have their own faults/merits and of course warranties, so it will come down to what you think is best for you.\nTry and get down your local retailer and see them in the flesh.\nThsi time of year there will be some fantastic deals around and you may end up with enough change in your pocket for other things!\nI have come across the Philips 42PF5521D which looks good, anyone got any feedback on this?\nWhat Antenna should I buy for local channels?\nQuestion What speakers should I buy!\nPosted By seanoevil In What Speakers Should I Buy?\nQuestion What should I buy, Denon or Sony?"
