    "text": "Occasional diarrhea is a common occurrence. Most people will experience an episode of diarrhea at least once or twice a year that will disappear in a couple of days.\nLuckily, there are many foods to eat that may help a person reduce the symptoms of diarrhea. There are also some foods to avoid when dealing with a bout of diarrhea, and some additional home care tips to consider.\nAnyone who is experiencing persistent diarrhea should see a doctor, as a person may become dehydrated over time.\nDiarrhea is a bowel movement that is more liquid than solid or has a loose texture. It is a common problem and may occur a couple of times each year. Diarrhea will usually last no more than 3 days.\nSoft, bland foods, such as toast, will help to absorb excess water and ease the symptoms of diarrhea.\nPeople with chronic digestive conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or Crohn's disease, may experience diarrhea more regularly.\nA person's diet is crucial if they are experiencing diarrhea. Some foods might help relieve symptoms of diarrhea while eating other foods can make diarrhea worse.\nWhile recovering from diarrhea, a person should eat bland, simple foods that are easy to digest and will help absorb some water from the stool.\nThese foods may be especially helpful on the first day of dealing with diarrhea. Eating many small meals throughout the day can help keep the digestive system from becoming overworked.\nProbiotic foods, such as yogurt and kefir, may help in some cases, but in others, probiotics may irritate the digestive system even more.\nProbiotics aid digestion by improving the balance of good and bad bacteria in the gut. However, dairy products can irritate the digestive system, so a person may wish to try non-dairy sources of probiotics, such as miso or sauerkraut.\nLiquids are also vital to recovery. People with diarrhea must drink plenty of water throughout the day and should drink an additional cup of water after every loose bowel movement.\nDrinking plenty of water helps prevent dehydration and flush any toxins out of the body.\nSoup broth will help to replace minerals and electrolytes lost because of diarrhea.\nSpicy ingredients can act as irritants in the digestive system. This is why people dealing with diarrhea should stick to bland foods, as they pose the least risk of agitating the digestive system.\nIt is not advisable to eat foods high in fat or oil when recovering from diarrhea. Added fats and oils from frying can be difficult for the sensitive digestive system to process and will likely make symptoms worse.\nA person can try eating boiled or steam vegetables and lean proteins instead.\nSugars that pass into the colon may disrupt the already sensitive bacteria there, making diarrhea worse. This includes fruit juices and high-sugar fruits.\nPeople with diarrhea should also avoid artificial sweeteners, as some can have a laxative effect.\nIt may also help to avoid too much fiber. Fiber helps keep the digestive system active. Usually, this is a good thing, but when the body is trying to recover from diarrhea, fiber may make symptoms worse.\nSoluble fibers, such as the pectin found in apples and bananas, can actually help a person recover from diarrhea, but a person should still try to limit their intake at least for the first day of symptoms.\nMany people experience diarrhea after drinking alcohol. Furthermore, some types of alcohol can be more likely to cause diarrhea than others. Learn more.\nCarbonated or fizzy drinks should be avoided, as they can irritate the digestive system and make the symptoms of diarrhea worse.\nCaffeinated beverages, such as coffee, tea, and soda, may overstimulate the digestive system and make symptoms worse.\nCarbonated drinks may also irritate or contribute to other symptoms, such as bloating and cramps. People should also avoid alcohol while dealing with diarrhea.\nWhile many sports drinks contain electrolytes that may help with dehydration, they often contain added sugars or artificial sweeteners. Coconut water or electrolyte-enhanced water are good alternatives.\nIn addition to following a diet that will help relieve diarrhea, there are several other remedies a person can take to make a swift recovery.\nOther diarrhea treatments include bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto Bismol) and Ioperamide (Imodium). These drugs can help relieve occasional cases of diarrhea and may be helpful to have on hand in a medicine cupboard.\nPepto Bismol and Imodium are available for purchase over-the-counter or online.\nPeople with diarrhea should also ensure they get enough rest, as putting the body in stressful situations while dealing with diarrhea may make matters worse.\nLimit physical activity while diarrhea symptoms are presenting, as strenuous activity may put the body at a greater risk of dehydration.\nHydration is also vital when managing diarrhea. Drink plenty of water throughout the day.\nClick here to learn more about treating diarrhea.\nBlood or mucus may appear in the stool in more serious cases of diarrhea. This is often accompanied by a fever and requires a visit to the doctor as soon as possible.\nUntreated diarrhea can also lead to serious complications, including dehydration. A person with severe diarrhea may require hospitalization and intravenous electrolytes.\nAnyone experiencing a fever of higher than 102\u00b0F or severe abdominal pains should visit a doctor.\nParents or guardians should carefully monitor any children with diarrhea. If symptoms do not clear up with 24 hours, they should call the doctor for guidance.\nAny additional symptoms should be reported to a doctor as soon as possible for diagnosis and treatment.\nMany cases of diarrhea last only a few days and respond well to home treatments. Eating a simple diet, increasing fluid intake, and using over-the-counter medications as necessary can help reduce symptoms quickly.\nIn cases where the body does not respond to these treatments after 2 or 3 days, a person should visit their doctor for diagnosis and treatment.\nJohnson, Jon. \"What foods to eat if you have diarrhea.\" Medical News Today.
