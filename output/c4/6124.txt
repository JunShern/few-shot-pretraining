    "text": "There are many ways to help people and children who need therapy. The treatments and solutions can be quite specific. Many of these treatments are subject to the setting, namely group therapy or individualized therapy.Both methods are completely valid and proven medically but Stevenson Waplak and Associates can service very different therapy needs for people who need care.\nGroup therapy, also known as group psychotherapy, is a form of treatment where a therapist or multiple therapists work with a group of patients collectively. The term is quite literal covering all forms of therapy covered in a group setting. The type of therapy managed in that group can vary greatly. Group therapy largely helps those with a condition aided by social interaction. Stevenson Waplak and Associates covers the following group therapies and more.\nThe Anger Management program employs a cognitive-behavioral therapy and solution focused approach.\nThe Social Skills program focuses on developing pro-social skills, such as, listening, self-image, accepting consequences, exercising self-control, problem solving, dealing with feelings, and dealing with peer pressure.\nEating Disorder Group Therapy addresses clients whom have deficits in behavioural coping skills and emotional dysregulation; furthermore, clients may struggle with extreme thinking, regulating emotions, emotional vulnerability, emotional sensitivity, and very intense response to stimuli, resulting in inappropriate behaviours and an inability to organize self or self-soothe.\nSolution Focused Group Therapy provides counselling services to a small group of clients through a Brief Solution-Focused approach.\nStress Management Group Therapy\u2019s goal is to quickly and effectively elicit realistic positive change through the development of self-control and emotional modulation skills in a therapeutic group setting.\nIndividual therapy is the polar opposite to group therapy. It refers to the treatment of a patient in a one on one environment with their care provider. This type of care applies to those that need close attention or to those who need individual assessments to determine the type of care needed.\nIndividual therapy also has many subsets of care that they focus in on. They include the following types of therapy and more.\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy is based on the idea that our thoughts cause our feelings and behaviors, not external things, like people, situations, and events.\nThe Brief Solution-Focused Therapy approach is designed to utilize goal oriented questioning and the client\u2019s own success to illicit positive client change that is both achievable and behavioural in nature.\nClinical Hypnotherapy is the method of utilizing a heightened sense of relaxation and suggestibility to promote therapeutic growth and change quickly and effectively.\nExploratory Hypnosis allows the client to gain a heightened sense of relaxation, and then utilize the subconscious mind to: (1) gain reasoning behind current thoughts, feelings or ongoing intrusive behaviors by allowing the subconscious to connect past events to present feelings/feelings, (2) experience \u201cAge Regression,\u201d bringing the client back to an earlier time in his/her life, and (3) experience \u201cPast Life Regression,\u201d potentially bringing the client back to a period of time before they were born.\nTherapeutic Play or Play Therapy is a form of psychotherapy for children, using play situations for diagnosis and /or treatment. Play provides a way for children to express their experiences and feelings through a natural, self-guided, self-healing process.\nSWA takes the time to stay ahead of the curve by running employee training programs and seminars to further educate their staff.\nContact us today for a consultation or for more information on our services visit our group therapy and individual therapy sections of our website for details.\nThis entry was posted in Mental Health Services.
