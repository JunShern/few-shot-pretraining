    "text": "The 1980s in the East and the Mideast took us to India after partition and Iran and Iraq. In all honesty, I did not know much about those places. I mean, I knew Indira Gandhi got assassinated by her own body guards but why I did not comprehend. Now I know. And I had never heard of the Bhopal disaster. So this was very educational for me.\nThe story on Iran and Iraq went on and on with twists and turns. We had a hard time retaining all the details. We got lost in them, but we survived.\nIf I were to pick five essential things or characteristics that a homeschooling mom should have, curiosity and a desire to learn would be two of the five. I got plenty of both. Most homeschooling moms I know feel the same.\nInstead of rice, we served the veggies over gluten free spaghetti.\nFor the project or craft activity, we chose to make a langar meal. Since we are vegetarian, the aloo gobi (potato cauliflower) fit perfectly with our lifestyle. I skipped the lemon and onion because I am allergic to both, and I adapted the other condiments so that it is not too spicy.\nUnfortunately, I could not interest the kids to eat it. They loved the smell, but once they tasted it, they wanted no more. We are just not big fans of Indian spices."
