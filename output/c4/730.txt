    "text": "A skin fade (or bald fade) is a modern hairstyle achieved by cutting the hair lower and lower as you move with the clipper towards the neck.\nWith classic shaved sides all around and a long top, the bald fade haircut is low-maintenance and easy to achieve. Just ask your local barber.\nThe incredible contrast between the top and faded sides makes the men\u2019s skin or bald fade one of our favorite cuts.\nA subtle take on the traditional skin fade style, a low bald fade starts increasing in length just above the ear.\nIt gradually grows longer until it is blended in with the hair on top of the head. The result is an understated yet stylish look that\u2019s perfect for men trying the bald fade for the first time.\nMore noticeable than a low fade, the medium bald fade is less striking than a high fade yet the cut sits perfectly in between.\nYou typically begin about an inch above the ear and it looks particularly stylish when paired with voluminous style up top, such as a quiff or pompadour.\nIf you're looking for a high-contrast haircut that will take your style to the next level, ask for a high bald fade on your next visit to the barber.\nThis cool cut features a skin-shave up around two inches above the ears. From there, the cut quickly yet smoothly transitions into the hair on top of the head.\nIf you love the look of a mohawk but want something slightly more subtle, ask your barber for a bald fade faux hawk.\nThis impressive hairstyle features a skin fade on the sides and back partnered with a long top styled into a central point from the forehead to the crown.\nFor men with thick, textured hair, a bald fade can make a fantastic choice.\nWhether low, medium or high, a bald fade will infuse your Afro with a sleek sense of polish and style while still allowing you to showcase your natural texture.\nOne of the great things about a bald fade is that it allows you to maintain a neat and polished appearance while providing the freedom to experiment with different styles on top.\nFor example, pairing a skin fade with a quiff can create a fashion-forward look that\u2019s still acceptable for the office.\nYou\u2019ll look seriously sleek if you decide to try (and successfully pull off) a slicked-back bald fade hairstyle.\nThis cut is perfect for men who like a polished yet daring appearance. Just remember to go easy on the hair product to maintain some natural movement and keep the look modern.\nFor a bald fade with a strong personality, consider adding a shaved design to your look.\nTo do this, simply ask your barber to cut your hair into a standard skin fade. Then, have them shave a shape or design of your liking into one side.\nWhen you pair a blowout with a bald fade, you can create a surprisingly stylish and striking look. To make sure you nail this hairstyle, ask your barber to cut your hair into a skin fade with at least an inch left up top.\nNext, style by using a blow-dryer and a brush or comb to pull your hair upwards as it dries. Finally, use a high-quality styling product, such as pomade and hairspray to hold the look in place.\nWe recommend ShapeShifter by Mack for Men for a firm, yet flexible hold.\nAlthough this look can be tricky to style, the combination of a skin fade with a beard can look fantastic when done right.\nThe trick here is to taper your beard, starting very short near your ears before gradually growing into a longer length at your chin.\nDoing this will achieve a subtle contrast between your beard and fade and is a great way to add some edge to a bald fade hairstyle.\nA fade shaved right down to the skin is obviously a very stylish look. But it can also be a little too bold for some men.\nIf you fall into this category, consider softening the appearance of your skin fade by pairing it with a textured crop on top. The extra texture will perfectly balance the smooth appearance of your fade.\nIf you\u2019re looking for a hairstyle that\u2019s smart, sharp and requires zero daily styling, you can\u2019t pass up the bald fade buzz cut.\nBy combining a skin fade and a buzz cut together, this minimal cut appears cool and contemporary. Just remember to book your barber for regular trims to keep your cut neat and precise.\nThe pompadour has been a top hairstyle among men for several years now. Although it\u2019s not going away anytime soon, there\u2019s no harm in giving this hairstyle a fresh update.\nTry asking your barber for a bald fade on the sides and back. The combination will leave you with a sleek and seriously on-trend appearance that's sure to stand out from the rest.\nAdd a touch of military style to your look by combining a skin fade haircut with an impressive side part style.\nYou notice this top cut boasts both precision and polish and offers men a bold look that can suit any occasion.\nFor a full bald fade that starts with absolutely no hair, ask your barber for a razor fade.\nUnlike a standard skin fade, which only uses clippers, this version requires the use of a straight razor to taper the hair down to the scalp.\nSimilar to a traditional military haircut, a military bald cut fade features hair shaved very short on top that is paired with a skin fade on the sides and back.\nThis low-maintenance hairstyle is perfect for achieving a minimal and masculine appearance.\nThe bald drop fade combines two fade cuts into one. This hairstyle, which reduces down to the skin with a drop fade, slopes downwards as it moves behind the ears to the back of the head.\nThe result is a clearly a fashionable version of the bald fade that can pair well with a variety of styles up top, making it an ideal hairstyle for men.\nUnlike other skin fade hairstyles, a bald taper fade does not rely solely on clippers to achieve its stylish appearance.\nInstead, this cut requires the use of scissors to smoothly transition from no hair around the ears to longer hair on top. It can be high, medium or low, and works well for men who prefer to maintain a decent length up high.\nGet your temples clean to the skin between a beard and the top hair for a sharp and neat vibe.\nThis bald fade hairstyle is the perfect choice for men wanting to pair a bald fade and a beard, but what a more subtle appearance they can rock every day.\nIf your a man searching for a dapper look, this bald fade is a great choice, offering you cleaned up sides to level up your hair game. On top of that, it suits almost all hair types.\nTo achieve a subtle yet classy look, try opting for a side-parted bald fade. This hairstyle is ideal for a business or professional setting, but can easily be dressed down for a casual, everyday look as well.\nMost bald fade haircuts are used to create dimension. With this one in particular, the sharp angles and precise curvy lines pair well with a Caesar cut.\nThis hairstyle is clearly for those looking to set the trends instead of following them.\nIf you have naturally wavy hair, this is the best bald fade hairstyle for you. The great thing about this look is you can shape it into practically anything you want and make it work for any occasion.\nIt might look rough and rugged to some, but with the right amount of hair wax, you can create beautiful waves and encourage the flow of your natural waves.\nIf you're a fan of the bald fade paired with a beard, you should definitely try pairing it with a disconnected hairstyle.\nWith this bald fade, your hairline and the beard line are discontinued by the fact that you have a shaved portion of your hair in the middle.\nIf you're considering adding a hard part, it could easily add some extra edge. It all comes down to taste.\nIf you have naturally curly hair, you're aware it can be both a gift and a curse. It\u2019s definitely what we would call a beautiful head of hair, but those born with such a delight will often tell you how difficult it is to maintain. A bald fade might take some of the pressure off.\nYou can even sport a fauxhawk with a bald fade if you have curly hair. You get to decide its length and volume, giving it that personal touch.\nEven though the middle section between the hairline and the beard line is a bald patch, that doesn\u2019t mean it has to be boring or simple in any way.\nIf you're looking for a hairstyle you can personalize and make your own, you can keep things interesting by adding designs, such as this classy V shape at the back of the head.\nA skilled barber will only take a few minutes to get you this look, as long as you have the right hair.\nIt will require leaving some thick and textured locks at the top that you should style with an upsweep and give the sides a razor fade with some elaborate patterns.\nYou can still have a blended look with a bald fade as you only need your barber to know and understand how to transition from the longer top to the skin level as gradually as possible.\nIf you're also a fan of buzzed hairstyles, try adding one to the crown with a fancy razor line to add some extra edge and style.\nNot only does a skin fade look great with pompadours, quiffs, and slicked back styles, but it also appears awesome when paired with an on-trend man bun.\nThis hairstyle, which is perfect for men with long, natural locks who want to try a new look, can be made even more unique with the addition of the double bun.\nThe flat-top hairstyle is another trend among men that keeps the top part of the hair flat while the rest is merged with the skin to create a seamless combination.\nAs you'll notice with this example, a cleanly trimmed beard compliments the look quite well.\nThis hairstyle is proof that the burst fade works with all types of hair, including thick, straight hair.\nIf you have naturally straight hair, this look offers the perfect contrast with the addition of a burst to the otherwise (boring) bald fade.\nFollowing the short sides, long top hair trend for men, this bald fade is no exception when it comes to a sleek and modern look."
