Lots of AMAZING deals with resources and things just for teachers! Seriously go check them out.\nClick on this photo to head to the website.\nIf you head there from this link here and sign up you will get a 10% discount on your very first purchase (Make sure you tell them I sent you to get this discount). There are always amazing free deals going on, and some of the things you can find will already be discounted by sometimes up to 70%!!!!!\nDisclaimer - While I will earn some future discounts by referring you to this site, it in no way impacts on how awesome I think it is!! Seriously, check it out you won't be disappointed.\nHey everyone!! Well it is well and truly Sunday in this part of the world, but that is okay by me! It's been a busy weekend, with family and friends heading to the cold south of Taupo for my baby sister's 21st birthday party!\nLast week Miss Nelson challenged us to look at perspective when taking our photos. So I got outside with some of the kids at my school and had some fun on the playground.\nHead over to Run Miss Nelson's got the camera! to see some more Saturday Snapshots from this week.\nAs teachers we are already a wee bit crazy.\nWe spend a good chunk of our time, energy, and money on the children in our class each year.\nWe spend countless hours organising wonderful lessons so that the children we teach will all be motivated, excited, and interested in what we have to say.\nWe buy our own professional development materials, and complete these readings, workshops, and conferences in our own time.\nAnd most of it goes thankless.\nWhen does enough become enough? When do you move from feeling like it will make a difference, to just pushing the proverbial up the hill?\nThis week was book week at my school. I spent countless hours organising people to come in and read to our kids, creating competitions for classes to do, and planning activities for classes to work through this week. And no one did anything. It was a huge waste of my time and energy. How much effort is too much? When all this preparation and planning was for the kids, and motivating them to read and write, when do you just pack it all in?\nI don't like always going on about my TPT store, but I do love when people have sales/discounts on their awesome products.\nCheck them out, grab the bargain, and remember that wonderful feedback! Also remember that you earn TPT credits towards future purchases when you leave feedback!\nWhile I'm thinking, head over to the Teaching Tribune and see what others have told you for their Monday Meet up this week.\nThere are always a whole lot of awesome bloggers who link up and let us know what is going on in their world. I love it because I can always find so many great ideas/people to follow. It's wonderful!\n1 - I can do about 9 different accents... and I can hold on to a couple of them for an entire conversation.\n2 - I'm all about the chicken! Chicken classic subway, grilled chicken from pita pit, chicken korma if I'm having Indian, or Panang curry with chicken for Thai.\n3 - The only time any one notices is if they take me to a party... Otherwise I've successfully faked it for long enough! When I left home to go to university, my youth pastor told me that on my first day I should walk into the halls of residence dining room and announce my presence like this \"Hello I'm Erin, and I'm here!\" Loudly mind you. So I did... Little did I know that there were only three of us who moved in that day, and everyone else came the next day! I got a reputation for being a loud, open, outgoing, confident person from that second onwards, and no one believed me when I was shy! Since then it's kinda stuck, and now is almost my actual personality... Hence the name of my blog actually!! I'm forever learning to be awesome.\nOh boy am I excited that this linky is back! This is by far, my all time favourite linky, and I am SOOOOOO happy it's back. Not only because I love taking photos and sharing them, but also because the photos that Miss Nelson takes are SPECTACULAR! Seriously, you should go through her whole blog, particularly those Saturday Snapshot ones, and take a look. I really need to take some photography lessons, because mine are terrible in comparison!\nOk, so this has been a crazy busy week. I've got a leadership role at my school where I take all the student leadership groups. This includes student council, sports leaders, and a few other things. One of the major things that falls under my role is Book Week. Someone asked what that is, well it's a week we celebrate everything about books. Reading, writing, authors, characters etc.\nI've sent probably 200 emails in the past two weeks inviting, booking, and confirming people from the community to come into school and read to our kids. Here's to that going off without a hitch!! We have 20 classes in our school, and I have enough readers for every class (except mine) to have two readers each. Some people are reading to more than one class though.\nAnd now on to my photos of the week... Well just the ones that are on my phone. I will be better for next week, that is for sure!\nAnd then there's my other sister who turned 21 yesterday. She's pretty good looking too.\nOur school gets given trees when we recycle. We've earned 10 trees so far this year.\nSo Thursday morning some of the classes went out in the cold rain to plant them.\nWhere we live the weather never gets all that cold. Most of our kids are Pasifika (From the Pasific Islands). So our Principal shipped in 8 tonnes of \"snow\" for the kids to play in and experience the coldness!!\nIt was very much like brown slush by the time we got there, but they still had a blast!\nAnd tried not to break our necks!\nI was the only teacher who had seen real snow before!!\nSo it was exciting for us too!!\nAnd then today I spent the day with some of my favourite girls from church and we got our nails done.\nNow I was supposed to draw this yesterday, but I got home at 5 and was asleep by 520pm last night! So here is the winner of my Synonym scrolls based on a random number draw - Well done Katie!! I will be emailing you shortly!!\nFor those that missed out, head over to my store and check them out! In honour of my two sisters being pretty darn awesome I've put my whole store at 20% off for the next 2 days.\nI really can't contain my excitement much longer... Soooo much cool and exciting stuff is happening over the next couple of weeks.\nMy other sister turns 21 in the morning!! Happy birthday Baby Bear!!\nNext week is Book Week - I've organised it this year and it's all coming together nicely!\nOh my gosh that is a lot to celebrate!! And chances are I've forgotten something!!\nAnd find out who won a copy of my synonym scrolls. Check out this post here for a bit of a giveaway!!\nSo my kids really struggle to use a thesaurus effectively. They take forever to even find the word they want to change, and then waste time choosing the one they want to swap out. Yes it's important to teach them how to use a dictionary and a thesaurus, but sometimes, their ideas are squashed when they can't find the right word to use quickly.\nMy kids LOVE these fans. They are colourful, easy to use, and durable if you laminate them! The version I'm using has lasted me about 5 years now!\nI've updated the graphics and colours, and they are now on sale in my TPT store for a bargain at only $1.50. Grab them now. I will be updating them as I get time, and find other well overused words!!\n1. Print, laminate, and cut out. It come in colour or B/W, so you can choose how to print.\n3. Use at your writing centre, or during independent writing time. You could even use them during your writers workshop!\nOnce you print and laminate, simple push a split pin through the black dot and you are ready to go!\nAnd now you can win a free copy! Tell me below what some of the words that your students over use are. I will choose a winner at random on Friday! You can also earn an entry by sharing the product on pinterest, or instagram. Just tag me (@learningtobeawesome) or comment below with your link.\nAnd now it's 11:10 on a Monday night and I have a busy day of school ahead of me... Better get to bed now!\nThere is so much to be excited about!!!\nWell now! That was an eventful week.\nTwo for Tuesday take two!\nIt's gotta get better right?\nWordless Wednesday - Running playlist!"
