    "text": "Berlin, I really like you\u2026 like, a lot! \u2013 Live. Love. Write. Travel!\nI said to my roommate as we exited Berlin\u2019s metro station. I was forewarned about Berlin. I was told about how modern the city was going to look. And how there is a lack of historical charm to the city\u2019s infrastructure. Obviously after being destroyed during the 2nd World War, Berlin is not as historically scenic as many of the other cities in Europe.\nWhile on its surface, Berlin definitely does remind you of any other big city\u2026 Modern buildings, apartment complexes, new malls, churches, restaurants, etc\u2026 The people, culture and the ever changing stages of Berlin\u2019s history is what makes it such a spectacular place.\nBERLIN IS BEAUTIFUL IN ITS OWN WAY!\nWith the current immigration conflict in Europe, Berlin has stepped in and allowed many people into the city. I mean by the thousands.\nI am constantly hearing from some of my European friends how unsafe things are in Germany now that the \u201crefugees\u201d are entering. And while many unfortunately believe that this could possibly open them up to terrorism, it also shows that after Germany\u2019s tumultuous history, they have become one of the most peaceful and giving countries in the world.\nThis sense of compassion is shown all over the city of Berlin. Unlike the city I currently reside in, Prague, Berlin is filled with culture and diversity. There are many Muslims, Africans, other European nationalities and Americans all coexisting in this one vast and might I add, very fashionable, city.\nI only spent a brief four days in Berlin, but it was four days well spent.\nGoing to Berlin in November! What would you recommend to put first on the list of things to do and see?\nHey Anna, there are so many amazing things to see in Berlin."
