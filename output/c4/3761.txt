    "text": "How big does my hair look? It's apparently taking over my head.\nAnd now I cannot stop. No really. Consider this a revolution of sorts!\nI like the fact that it adds that \"something\". It\u2019s the kind of detail that is made for summer days and everything I have acquired to date will be making it into my suitcase for my August holiday. Oh god, I cannot wait for that time!\nAnyway, here are my picks!\n1. Urban Outfitters kaftan \u2013 Link! \u2013 this is the most expensive pick but I like the idea of getting a kaftan for beach situations. I think this is also pretty enough to wear out in the evening.\n2. New Look top \u2013 Link! \u2013 A cheap number from New Look, here the detail is very subtle across the top edge but it\u2019s there. I also like the flow on this one.\n3. Missguided top \u2013 Link! \u2013 I am 100% going to buy this. It will be great to wear with shorts/jeans. It\u2019s just a good basic with a twist.\n4. ASOS shorts \u2013 Link! \u2013 Elephant print? Sure! As long as pom poms are involved.\n5. Topshop top \u2013 Link! \u2013 This looks like a good basic in a versatile olive colour. My only concern here is what would happen with the boobage situation within this style but let\u2019s not worry about that now.\nSo that\u2019s where I am with pom poms. Oh and if you like Nikki\u2019s stuff then send her a message on Instagram \u2013 here\u2019s her profile page. All fabrics are sourced/made in Bali. The floral pattern is my personal favourite!\nps. how did you get your hair so big??\nI don't know! I think it was the heat. No oribe was used either. So odd!\nYour hair looks so nice and full of volume.\nI love that little bit of extra detail that they add to the shorts! Pretty!\nLoving the pom poms too! They are great, your hair is stunning!\nI've seen pom pom trimming, but never knew that's what it was! I love that Top Shop tank!\npompoms look so cute, I need to put them on all of my clothes!!\nLove the chevron design as well as the pom pom trim on your shorts Laura & way to go with the big hair!\nI was originally thinking big knitted pom-poms for some reason but this detailing is sooo cute!!! I like the look of the Boohoo shorts but think I will wait and see how you get on with them first!!\nLove this trend! You should check out your local boutiques- they seem to have the cutest pairs that aren't as mainstream!\nDefinitely interested in hearing how those BooHoo shorts turn out. They look AMAZING!\nLove these picks! Etsy also do so lovely handmade ones!\nYour hair does look voluminous! I love pom poms too... I want a scarf and shorts with them on!"
