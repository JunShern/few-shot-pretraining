    "text": "NOTE: I\u2019m not a debater. I\u2019m much more of a motivator. So this post has been difficult for me to write. (It took me two days to write it.) And I pray that my readers take it in the way it is written\u2013with utmost love for and sensitivity toward each of you. Having said that, I realize that being an effective motivator sometimes involves bringing up the obvious and dealing with it\u2013even if the obvious is difficult or painful.\nI\u2019ve been teaching my Inspiring Evangelism course at a church in west Houston. (Wonderful people are at BridgePoint Bible Church!) Last Wednesday night we discussed a difficult subject. We realized there is a big mistake taking place among the Christian world\u2013at least in America. Our big mistake is that we have adopted a we vs. them mentality of us and the world. Battle lines have been drawn between the Christian world and the rest of the world.\nWe, Christians, do not shy away from the fight. We hang on to 2 Timothy 4:7 where Paul said he \u201cfought the good fight.\u201d Yet we have taken that to mean something different than what Paul meant.\nAnd so we fight for our rights in America.\nWe fight for better politics.\nWe fight for the most correct theology. And we\u2019re even willing to fight each other over many of these things.\nWe fight for our Christian world. And we should strive toward excellence in these areas. I don\u2019t disregard these.\nHowever, in doing so, we end up fighting the non-Christian person when we should be fighting for him.\nOne way is that we tend to limit our daily dealings to Christian-only businesses and organizations. We take our business and dealings to those who post the fish symbol on their web-page. Many Christians tend to avoid businesses that are owned by a people of other faiths\u2013boycotting them because of it.\nAnother way is that we do not wish to look like the world so much so that we have separated ourselves from it. We have built a wall of \u201cprotection\u201d around ourselves. This wall keeps out anyone who does not share, not only our faith, but also our opinions, gestures, styles, speech, preferences, and worldviews. And we have justified this as our act of being holy.\nWe have failed to see that Jesus suffered outside the camp (outside the wall of protection) where the hurting, despised, and lost people live. We have failed to undertake the responsibility of suffering with Him outside the camp (see yesterday\u2019s post on this).\nSo we have left the world to itself. To fend for itself. We have told ourselves that the world has gone so far into chaos that the Church must separate and keep to ourselves.\nOh how we have missed God\u2019s mark!\n7 But we were gentle among you, just as a nursing mother cherishes her own children. 8 So, affectionately longing for you, we were well pleased to impart to you not only the gospel of God, but also our own lives, because you had become dear to us. 9 For you remember, brethren, our labor and toil; for laboring night and day, that we might not be a burden to any of you, we preached to you the gospel of God.\n1. Do I act gently toward non-Christians?\n2. Do I cherish them as a mother cherishes her own children?\n3. Do I feel affectionate toward them?\n4. Am I eager to, not only impart the gospel of God, but to sacrifice my own life for them?\n5. Are non-Christians dear to me?\n6. Do I desire to labor and toil for them and not be a burden to them?\nTough questions to answer? Perhaps not, if we\u2019re honest with ourselves.\nIf we truly believe that Christ died for our sins and rose from the dead, and that believing in Him alone gives us everlasting life\u2013then shouldn\u2019t we be eager enough and loving enough to live out this good news to non-Christians around us?\nAfter all, God has entrusted us with His gospel to bring to the lost (1 Thessalonians 2:4).\nHow will we love them if we do not know them? How will we know them if we are not friends with them? And how will we become friends with them if we hold on to this mentality of we vs. them?\nIt\u2019s time to let our love wash out the line drawn in the sand.\nQuestions? Comments? For the edification of the Church, feel free to reply with your thoughts.\nWhat can I give to the non-Christian that is of any value other than the word of God. I know there are many people out there \u201con the fence\u201d when it comes to religion, the Bible, Jesus, and faith. Seeing a Christian show them anything but love can throw them off of the fence in the wrong direction and for that we do need to be careful!!\nBut when you deal with people who constantly slander the name of our God showing them love is not what I truly believe we NEED to do. Respect, yes. (1 Peter, 2:17) Love, I\u2019m not sure\u2026..Non-Christians falsely assume that Christians are hypocrites because they believe in an all loving God and yet cannot show love to all people in all situations all of the time. Well, if we did that, does that make us tolerant of every sin and every human condition? What distinguishes us as Christians if we are afraid to rebuke those who are not living a Christian lifestyle? Speak the truth in love\u2026.this is vitally important because more than anything we want to show everyone the love of Christ, but unfortunately in the world we live in (call it the end times if you like) there are so many hardened hearts you cannot even say the word Jesus without being hated. What good is my love going to do for them?\nI think of Jesus\u2019 message in Matthew 10:12-15. \u201cWhatever town or village you enter, search for some WORTHY PERSON there and stay at that person\u2019s house until you leave. As you enter the home, give it your greeting. (be respectful). If the home is DESERVING, let your peace rest on it; if it is not, let your peace return to you. If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words, SHAKE THE DUST OFF YOUR FEET when you leave that home or town. Truly I tell you, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town.\u201d So Jesus did tell his disciples that the people would know them by their showing of love, but he did not tell them that their love would be useful to all. He recognizes that some people just cannot be saved.\nAnd if some people cannot be saved then why do we continue to waste our time \u201cloving them?\u201d What was the reason Jesus told his disciples to dust off their feet? I don\u2019t approve of hate. I don\u2019t approve of the us versus them mentality. I do however acknowledge and I think the Bible does too (you\u2019re welcome to prove me wrong). That sometimes love just ain\u2019t enough\u2026.\nI guess for me the best way I know how to show love to an unbeliever with a hardened heart is to pray for them. But as far as me working hard to have a relationship with them\u2026.I\u2019m not convinced that that is necessary\u2026..What are your thoughts?\nThanks for your thoughtful comments, friend. I guess my response is that loving the non-Christian does not equal condoning sin.\nBasically, I feel that one we as Christians share the biblical basis for our views while speaking or interacting with those that don\u2019t agree with us, it is no longer our responsibility to \u201chound\u201d them. Just as I don\u2019t want someone that is an atheist hounding me trying to get me to change my beliefs, I don\u2019t think non-Christians desire the same of us. Nor do I think we are commanded to follow them to the depths shaking our bible at them while they refuse to acknowledge it. Once I inform you of God\u2019s word, and you have knowledge that there is another side to your (wrong) belief/principle, then it no longer falls on me to coddle you. Yes, I will be your friend, but until you come to me, I\u2019m just going to continue on living my life to please God and show you His love in that way.\nTo the poster above me, I believe you have valid points also. I don\u2019t feel love for ALL people, I try to see the good in people, and give the benefit of the doubt, and I have very close friends and family that are non-Christians whom I love dearly. You can love non-Christians, but it\u2019s not something I feel we are commanded to do. There is a huge disconnect with Christians that don\u2019t know how to love/respect the person but hate the deed. You know the old \u201cdon\u2019t throw the baby out with the bathwater\u201d deal. I think we are to share God\u2019s love with them, and show them compassion and present ourselves as someone forgiven and cared for by God so they would want to experience the same.\nThanks, Mel! Your thoughts are important to me. I guess my thinking is that since \u201cGod so loved the world\u201d so should we. But love doesn\u2019t mean condoning sin, and (as you rightly said) it doesn\u2019t mean bashing non-Christians over the head. And this love can be expressed in a variety of ways\u2013always led by the Holy Spirit. Good thoughts, Mel.\nI\u2019m not disagreeing with Chad\u2019s post at all. I\u2019m simply pointing out a truth. There are people in this world that hate us. They HATE US with a passion that I will NEVER understand because I don\u2019t hate anyone. I\u2019m simply realistic here\u2026. I cannot show love to those who hate me. It can\u2019t be done!!! (well except maybe through prayer like I mentioned in my original post) In reading Matthew 10:12-15; tell me why did Jesus say that? Have you ever tried to be loving to someone who, because you are a Christian, mocks you, brings up evolution constantly, and uses the name of your Lord in vein just to see you wiggle. What love should I show other than love enough to bite my tongue and walk away. The devil is doing some of his finest work in this world. I know that I cannot change any hearts. That is God\u2019s job. So I guess my question boils down to this. Chad\u2019s post is correct in theory, but how do we love those who don\u2019t want us to love them. Those who HATE us, mock us, say horrible things to and about us. I am not Jesus!!! I\u2019m not that good. I know he did it, and yet he instructed his apostles to walk away!!!! Is there a time where it is ok to \u201cdust off our feet\u201d if you will? Becauses I would NOT sacrifice my life for one of these people.\nIt hurts when we are attacked for our belief in Christ. And it is true that the world will hate us, just as Christ said it would.\nBut it is also true that Christ can love those through us. Realizing that those who ridicule me are ultimately rejecting Jesus\u2013not me.\nI don\u2019t think we should push the gospel continually on those who act out against us in hatred. There are so many who are eager to know Christ and waiting for us to bring His gospel to them.\nThe point of my blogpost was for us to consider ceasing the fight against the world and begin to fight for the world. This love for them can be expressed in a variety of ways: praying for them, giving to their needs, sacrificing for them, etc. After all, we are commanded to love our enemies and to do good to those who hate us.\nThis is not easy. That\u2019s why we must all God to love them through us. However, many of us are not willing to let that happen.\nThat\u2019s the mistake we make.\nThanks for your authenticity! It\u2019s refreshing.\nI do understand what you are saying and I do appreciate this post. It is hard to hear what we don\u2019t want to hear, but make no mistake I want and need to know this. This post has inspired me to dig a little deeper and go into the different kinds of love that it talks about in the Bible. The Greek definitions and compare the different kinds of love in all the different situations that that Bible refers to showing love in. You really do need a working definition of love to grasp this concept fully. Surely God does not expect us to show our enemies the same kind of love that Jesus showed us!!!\u2026.or does He? Questions I will be pondering soon \ud83d\ude09 Thanks again!\nKeep searching, friend! Thanks for your comments! God bless.\n1 John 4:9-10 talks about the 4 aspects of agape love: it\u2019s all giving, sacrificial, toward those who don\u2019t deserve it, and it takes initiative. This is how we are to love one another. And this is how God loves the world (John 3:16). This is how Jesus loved lost people. It\u2019s how the apostles loved lost people.\nGlad I could be of help to you, friend!\nPassion \u2013 I think, in short, that the Bible tells us to love other Christians (and you can certainly love non-Christians), but you don\u2019t have to daily or repeatedly subject yourself to riducule. You can, and sometimes God can overcome their views through you, but sometimes it is ok to turn the other cheek. Yes, Jesus \u201chung\u201d out with less than desireable people, and some Christians feel that is their calling to go to the bottom of the barrel and minister, but not all of us feel that calling and I certainly don\u2019t think that it\u2019s our Christian duty to subject ourselves to someone that has heard the word and chooses to vehamently deny it. So, no, you don\u2019t have to show \u201cLOVE\u201d to those that hate you, but you do have to show restraint and common sense.\ni hear ya, Mel. And love can be expressed by praying for those who persecute. I\u2019ll check out your blog!\nThank you for this! and especially on a forum such as Facebook. Especially at a time such as now, as I\u2019m seeing more and more of my friends who are believers and my non-believing friends fighting \u201cLOUDLY\u201d and lengthily on Facebook about political issues. We\u2019ve gotten caught up in the minor things of this world. And we are forgetting eternal matters. Shame on us! Christ physically touched the sick and lost to heal them; he ate with sinners- not to partake of their sins, but to love them and reach out to them with his inclusion; he died for \u201cme\u201d while I was lost! Thank you Jesus! Can I not love the unbeliever? minister to the unbeliever? reach out to the unbeliever? share Christ while they are lost? do business with them? associate with them/without partaking of sin with them? If not, how will I win them to Christ?\nVery true, Glenda! Thanks for your great comments here!\nWhat a lot to consider! I\u2019m an old? preacher \u2026 just returned to the pastorate after 17 years retirement \u2026. Yes, we battle each other \u2026 within the local church, between denominations, etc. Personality flaws and the like bring on some of that. But we probably don\u2019t battle the world enough \u2026 I don\u2019t see very many recently who will quit trading because the owner may not be Christian or not the right kind of Christian. Saw more of it in the 50s and 60s \u2026 now we are much more a part of THEM.\nMore times will come when we will need to seek the wisdom of the Lord and be vigilant to see what\u2019s going on around us that will try to overcome and destroy our witness.\nMy book .. A JOY TO SHOUT ABOUT, has messages that relate to this.\nThanks for your many years of service to our Lord! And \u201cold\u201d is such a relative term, ain\u2019t it?\nYou make good points, my friend! God bless!\nExcellent point! That\u2019s why my inner circle of friends comes from a group at Kingwood Bible Church!"
