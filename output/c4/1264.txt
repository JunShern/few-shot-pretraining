    "text": "Cayston treats certain types of bacterial infections. Inform your doctor if you have any new diarrhea while receiving this medication.\nCayston is a prescription medicine used to treat certain bacterial infections. Cayston is in a class of drugs called monobactam antibacterials. It interferes with the growth of bacterial cells and causes them to die.\nCayston also comes in inhalational form. It is inhaled through the mouth into the lungs using a machine called an Altera Nebulizer. It is usually given three times a day for 28 days.\nCommon side effects of Cayston inhalation include cough, wheezing, and sore throat.\nHow was your experience with Cayston?\nWhat tips would you provide a friend before taking Cayston?\nWhat are you taking Cayston for?\nHow well did Cayston work for you?\nHow likely would you be to recommend Cayston to a friend?\nCayston is used to treat patients above the age of 7 with cystic fibrosis (CF) who have a lung infection caused by the bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa.\nIt is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, but you should take all of your medication as prescribed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Cayston or other antibacterial drugs in the future.\nTrouble breathing right after treatment with Cayston (bronchospasm). To decrease the chance of this happening, be sure to use your inhaled bronchodilator medicine before each treatment with Cayston.\nDo not take Cayston if you are allergic to it or to any of its inactive ingredients.\nTell your doctor if you are allergic to any other medications, especially antibiotics, before taking Cayston. There might be a small risk taking Cayston if you have had an allergic reaction to particularly an antibiotic in the past.\nMedicines can interact with certain foods. In some cases, this may be harmful and your doctor may advise you to avoid certain foods. In the case of Cayston there are no specific foods that you must exclude from your diet when receiving Cayston.\nThis medication falls into category B. There are no well-done pregnancy studies that have been done in humans with Cayston. In animal studies, pregnant animals were given this medication, and the babies did not show any medical issues related to this medication.\nTell your doctor if you are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. The active ingredient in Cayston can pass into breast milk. Talk to your doctor about the best way to breastfeed your baby if you take Cayston.\nTake Cayston as prescribed, in courses of 28 days on Cayston , followed by at least 28 days off Cayston, as directed by your doctor.\nThe dose of Cayston for both adults and children 7 years of age and older is one vial of Cayston (75 mg of Cayston), mixed with one ampule of saline (diluent) 3 times a day.\nIf you take too much Cayston, call your doctor or local Poison Control Center, or seek emergency medical attention right away.\nStore Cayston and saline in the refrigerator at 36 \u00b0F to 46 \u00b0F (2 \u00b0C to 8 \u00b0C) until needed."
