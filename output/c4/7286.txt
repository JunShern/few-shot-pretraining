Like a drifting soul in search of a body, the poet, whenever he chooses, enters the lives and characters of those around him.\nAbout 20 years ago, as an aspiring Australian writer, I received a fellowship to attend a writer's colony situated near Saratoga Springs in upstate New York. The old mansion and surrounding bungalows known as Yaddo were established by American philanthropists over a century ago, as a sanctuary for writers and poets to press ahead with their work. Soon after I arrived I met a young poet called Elizabeth.\nFrom time to time, readings from works in progress were held in the sitting room of the old, almost gothic mansion at Yaddo. I can recall Elizabeth reading some poems at a gathering of that kind. It was a friendly occasion but as there were only a handful of people in the room, I was soon reminded of similar readings in Australia - tiny gatherings where poets presented their wares to a small but dedicated coterie.\nI have a photograph of Elizabeth reading at a microphone in an open sided marquee at Treasure Beach, Jamaica, with a glimpse of palm trees and turquoise sea in the background. I can well remember the smell of jerk chicken in the air and the throb of marimba drums from Jake's Hut nearby where most of the visiting writers were staying. The audience for Elizabeth\u2019s reading was larger than at Yaddo, but still not very large.\nI next saw Elizabeth a few years later. It was about 3 am on a Wednesday morning. I was in pyjamas at the time. From my home in Perth, like many others, I had tuned in to see the newly-elected President of the United States, Barak Obama, take the oath of office. After he had spoken, a reading was given by Elizabeth Alexander, Professor of African American Studies at Yale University. Elizabeth, the little known poet I had seen reading in an almost deserted sitting room at Yaddo, then in a tent near Jake's Hut in Jamaica, was now standing on a stage outside the Capitol building in Washington DC. She was reading her work to a world wide television audience of countless millions.\nShe and her fellow poets on that day turned inevitably to the themes that have always been of interest to a general audience \u2013 birth and death, love and passion, and a preoccupation with the past, for when we love life, we love the past, because the past is that much of the present which has survived in human memory. In Elizabeth\u2019s case the outsider had moved inwards and momentarily come close enough to the centre of things to be influential, to mark the beginning of a new era, to shape the tone of times to come. But the duality in a poet\u2019s nature and the timeless themes I mentioned a moment ago are always there, and they can have the opposite effect. As the end approaches, a poet who has been close to the centre of things may finish up on the margins, in a kind of exile, as yet again he or she dwells upon the past and a love of life. This brings me to the work of a contemporary Australian poet who worked in every corner of the literary world and found his way eventually to the centre of things\u2014Clive James. Tonight is a fitting occasion to honour a great Australian writer who is now, by his own admission, very close to the end after a long and debilitating illness.\nHampstead Heath was a slush curry of dead leaves but lent itself to the creative meanderings of young writers \u2026 On a park bench, padded with newspapers, I sat shivering while a new kind of poem formed in my notebook. It was a poem I could understand. Until then most of my poems had been incomprehensible. Now they were becoming comprehensible, a transformation that would have allowed me to detect their sentimentality if they had not been so true to my feelings, which were sentimental.\nBut now, in recent years, having been right at the centre of things\u2014critic, novelist, TV personality\u2014Clive James has come back to poetry. The elegiac works in his recent book, Sentenced to Life, are particularly memorable as he reflects upon mortality and\u2014to paraphrase T. S. Eliot\u2014dwells upon things ill-done and done to others harm which once one took for exercise of virtue.\nThey all stretch out their hands to me: but they are too far away!\nNicholas Hasluck\u2019s latest novel Rooms in the City (Australian Scholarly Publishing) concerns an Australian-born poet Robert Kaub who is recruited to an espionage unit in Athens during the Gallipoli campaign. His first published poem was in Westerly 9:1 in 1964.\nPixie Burke (nee Hale) passed away peacefully last night around midnight Perth time. Miles and Alice were by her side, and Charlie has flown from Hong Kong today to be with them. Look to The West Australian in coming days for funeral arrangements.\nAs she went through the Pearly Gates, St Peter said, Take those taps off! There'll be no tap-dancing on clouds!\nIn partnership with Brisbane Square Library, Queensland Poetry Festival's Co-Director David Stavanger presents two dynamic voices in this monthly performance & poetry event.\nSeptember is a very special COUPLET as it is co-presented with Brisbane Writers Festival and features an interstate and international guest, Andy Jackson (Melb) and Ivy Alvarez (NZ)."
