    "text": "This is a list of original characters found in Peter Jackson's film adaptations of J. R. R. Tolkien's The Hobbit.\nRyan Gage as Alfrid in Peter Jackson's The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug.\nAlfrid Lickspittle (portrayed by Ryan Gage) is a cowardly and greedy man who is a government official of the town of Esgaroth and the Master of Lake-town's conniving servant. Ultimately, Alfrid is betrayed by the Master and forced to fend for himself during Smaug's attack on Laketown. After almost getting lynched by the angry survivors, Alfrid ends up working under Bard before fleeing from Dale with some looted gold during the Battle of the Five Armies. Alfrid's ultimate fate is revealed in the extended edition, where he is forced to hide in the sling of a catapult atop a dead troll. As another troll closes in on Gandalf, who is fighting close by, Alfrid panics and accidentally sets off the catapult. This launches Alfrid into the attacking troll's mouth, killing himself instantly while inadvertently saving Gandalf by causing the troll to die from asphyxiation.\nBetsy Butterbur, a relative of Barliman Butterbur from The Fellowship of the Ring, appears as a barmaid of The Prancing Pony in the prologue of The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, portrayed by Peter Jackson's daughter Katie Jackson.\nRichard Whiteside appears as Butterbur Sr.\nBill Ferny, a henchman of Saruman who confronted Frodo Baggins in Bree, was absent from Jackson's Lord of the Rings series. However, his father appears in The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug as an assassin hired by Azog to neutralise Thorin at the Prancing Pony. He eyes Thorin from across the room, but when Gandalf introduces himself to Thorin, Bill thinks better of it and leaves the inn without incident. In this adaptation, Ferny Sr. is portrayed by Dallas Barnett.\nA Squint-Eyed Southerner appears alongside Bill Ferny at the Prancing Pony in the prologue of The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, portrayed by New Zealand actor Matt Smith.\nBraga (portrayed by Michael Mitchinson) is captain of the Lake-town Guard, a role held by Bard in the book. Braga and his underlings act as the Master's enforcers and show no regard for Bard and the other common folk. During Smaug's attack on the Lake-Town, Braga and his men abandon the people of the town and instead assist the Master in evacuating his treasures. Braga dies along with the Master as the body of the dead dragon crushes the boat they were trying to escape on.\nHilda Bianca (portrayed by Sarah Peirse) is a woman of Lake-Town, who is among the first to spot the dwarves as Bard leads them through the city and later spreads the news to her neighbors. She holds Master's lackey Alfrid in disdain, refusing him help after the town's destruction by Smaug. During the Battle of the Five Armies she motivates the women and the elders to join their men in the defense of the city of Dale.\nPercy (portrayed by Nick Blake) is the gatekeeper of Lake-Town and a friend of Bard. During the destruction of Lake-Town he watches as Bard heroically slays the dragon and later spreads the news among the survivors. He becomes Bard's second-in-command during the Battle of the Five Armies, leading the archers during the defense of Dale. He survives the battle and later sounds the horn that signals the Men's respect for the fallen Thorin Oakenshield during the dwarven king's funeral.\nTilda and Sigrid (portrayed by Mary and Peggy Nesbitt respectively) are the daughters of Bard the Bowman. In Tolkien's legendarium, Bain is the only known child of Bard. In the original script, Tilda was Bard's only daughter and Sigrid was the name of his wife, but Luke Evans requested changing his character to a widower to emphasize greater responsibility for his family.\nTauriel (portrayed by Evangeline Lilly) is a female Elf from Mirkwood and the Chief of the Guards for the Elvenking, Thranduil. She also has a romantic subplot with the dwarf Kili.\nElros (portrayed by Robin Kerr) is an Elf of the Woodland Realm appearing in The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug. He is a captain of the Woodland Guard, as well as the Keeper of the Keys - he is initially charged with watching the dwarves and is later charged with watching the Front Gate of Thranduil's Halls.\nFeren (portrayed by Simon London) is an Elf of the Woodland Realm. In The Desolation of Smaug, after Legolas discovers that Thorin Oakenshield and Company have escaped from their prison cells via wine barrels, he orders Feren to blow the horn and alert the Elves guarding the river, ordering them to close the gate. Later, in The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, Feren is sent by Thranduil to summon Legolas back to Mirkwood and to inform Tauriel that the Elvenking has banished her from the Realm. He also serves as one of Thranduil's chief lieutenants during the Battle of The Five Armies.\nFatty Bolger - Overweight hobbit and friend of Frodo Baggins omitted from the film adaptation of the Fellowship of the Ring. A character sharing Fredegar's name and appearance appears in the epilogue of The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies and buys some of Bilbo's furniture from the auctioneer, Mr. Grubb.\nFredegar Chubb (portrayed by Eric Vespe from Ain't It Cool News) is a Hobbit who sells Bilbo a fish at the market in the extended edition of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. Vespe was present on set making several reports covering the location shooting and was invited to appear as an extra in Hobbiton scenes. Originally a non-speaking part, Peter Jackson decided to give him a line, promoting his role to that of an actor and requiring to give the character a name.\nMaster Worrywort (portrayed by Timothy Bartlett) is a hobbit of the Shire and a neighbor of Bilbo Baggins. In The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey he briefly appears calling after Bilbo as he is running to catch up with the dwarves. An additional scene in the extended edition shows Bilbo inquiring whether Worrywort had seen a wizard pass by at the market. Worrywort is the first hobbit to greet Bilbo after his return from the journey in The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies.\nFimbul (portrayed by Stephen Ure) is an Orc and Warg rider, who is among Yazneg's orcs as they pursue Thorin's company through the Ettenmoors in An Unexpected Journey. He accompanies Yazneg to Weathertop where Yazneg is killed by Azog for his failure. Fimbul is present among Azog's warg-riders as they corner the dwarves in the fir trees and survives the confrontation with the eagles. In The Desolation of Smaug Fimbul accompanies Bolg in the continuing the pursuit of the dwarves, smelling the ground along the river where the dwarves encountered Bard the Bowman. As part of the Orc party that infiltrates Lake-Town, Fimbul relays back to Bolg that Thorin himself has left and gone to the Lonely Mountain with most of the company from inside a small wooden boat, when another orc jumps down into the boat's opposite end from the balcony above; this launches Fimbul into the air, where his head is removed by the longknives of Legolas.\nGrinnah (portrayed by Stephen Ure) is the goblin who introduces the Dwarves to the Great Goblin and is ordered to search through their possessions. He is stabbed through the chest by Kili as the dwarves and Gandalf make their escape.\nNarzug (portrayed by Ben Mitchell) is one of Azog's Hunter Orcs. He is taken captive by Legolas and Tauriel in The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug and brought to the Elvenking's halls, where, after interrogation, he is decapitated by Thranduil.\nRagash is an Orc who relays to Azog that the army is ready to attack on the next day's morning in The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies. Ragash is portrayed by Allan Smith, while Martin Kwok provides his voice.\nYazneg (portrayed by John Rawls) is a fierce Orc lieutenant and second-in-command of Azog's hunter party in An Unexpected Journey. He finds Thorin's Company while they camp at night in the Lone Lands, and he leads the attack of the Hunter Orcs against the party as they flee the Trollshaws. Because of his failure to capture the Dwarves, he is killed by Azog at the top of Weathertop, his body thrown to the Wargs.\nThe goblin scribe (portrayed by Kiran Shah) is a tiny goblin with a brief appearance as a scribe and messenger for the Great Goblin in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey.\n^ Jackson, Peter (19 May 2011). \"Hobbit Casting News\".
