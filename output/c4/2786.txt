    "text": "This web site is owned and operated by Jewellery Workshop who are completely dedicated to your total satisfaction. If you have any suggestions or comments or if you need to contact us, please email us using the link on the store page or use the details below.\nThis is our registered office address, but not our operational address, as such calling in person is not possible.\nWe do also have a linked business in Maidstone which we can arrange for you to collect, or exchange goods if you are local, however this does need to be by appointment.\nWe accept Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Paypal. We do not charge for any item until it is ready to ship. Backordered items are not charged until they are shipped. If you do not wish to pay online, you may also pay via telephone during normal working hours.\nOur website is very complex in its operation. Should a situation arise with the website, or software that causes an item price to be incorrectly calculated, or an additional product such as a chain price not to be calculated correctly when included with a product, we will not be obliged to honour the price as it would have been deemed as an obvious error. We will however contact you to advise.\nInternational orders can take up to 15 working days for most countries outside Europe. South Africa is usually the longest to be delivered at over 20 days.\nMost products are in stock for immediate delivery, however some products may have to be ordered from our suppliers, or specially made to your requests. So that you know the timescale of any product we do include an approximate dispatch time on each product. Please note that the dispatch time is the time we usually take to dispatch the product, and not the expected delivery time. You will be offered a choice of delivery speeds during the checkout process.\nAll advertised prices are inclusive of any UK payable taxes such as Vat.\nIf you are purchasing from abroad, additional taxes may be charged by your own country for any item ordered from us. We are not responsible for any additional import costs or taxes that you may incur. We would strongly advise that you look into any tax or import charges that may be charged by your own country upon receiving your order.\nAll products on our website carry a twelve months manufacturers guarantee against manufacturing faults or defects.\nOur guarantee does not cover accidental, or deliberate damage to any of our jewellery.\nJewellery in wear does scratch, and some materials such as silver, or copper is likely to tarnish. This is considered normal with jewellery and is not a manufacturing issue. In most cases the jewellery can be returned to a new condition by either polishing, or cleaning and is considered to be an expected maintenance task to be undertaken by the customer.\nPlease note that as we are an Internet based company we do not have a dedicated sales telephone line as over 95% of our communication is carried out by email.\nYou are welcome to contact us by telephone 9.30am to 5pm Monday to Friday, we do have an answer phone in place during busy periods, and out of business hours.\nJewellery Workshop do not disclose buyers' information to third parties other than when order details are processed as part of the order fulfilment. In this case, the third party will not disclose any of the details to any other third party.\nYou are entitled to cancel your order and return the goods within 14 working days for a full refund, including the cost of any compulsory delivery charges, but excluding any postal upgrades which are the clients choice. Do this by contacting us by email or telephone and quoting the order number supplied to you. Your refund will be paid within 30 days. You are responsible for the cost and risk of loss or damage when returning the goods, so you should take out enough postal insurance to cover their value. This cancellation policy does not affect your rights when we are at fault - for example, if goods are faulty or misdescribed.\n*Although we legally have to state 14 working days for returns, we do actually have a policy of 30 calendar days.\n*Although we have to legally state refunds will be processed within 30 working days, in reality they are usually only 1 to 2 days, if not the same day.\nRefunds will only be made to the named purchaser who placed the order, and will only be paid back to the same payment source, either being the same credit or debit card, or the same Paypal account. If the item was received as a gift, then we can arrange a credit note or voucher instead.\nSeveral times a year we do close for holidays, this can cause a slight delay on refunds, however you will be aware of this in advance with either a notice in the shopping cart at the time of order, or a message on your invoice upon receipt of your order. We will always extend your returns period by the length of our closure so as not to disadvantage you returning goods.\nAny goods returned should be in saleable condition, and not personalised or engraved.\nYou are legally entitled to cancel your order and return the goods within 14 working days for a full refund by law, we have extended this above the legal requirement to 30 days allowing you ample time to decide if an item is suitable for you.\nDiscount codes, and coupon codes can only be redeemed online, and will not be accepted via telephone.\nAny discount codes, or coupon codes must be redeemed at the time of order, as we are unable to add them later.\nWe reserve the right to remove coupon codes and discount codes without notice, and make no guarantee on longevity of any voucher or code.\nWe reserve the right to cancel any coupon codes, or discount codes that we deem to have been misused. This would include codes given to specific groups, which are then shared or posted online.\nOnly one discount code or coupon code can be used per order, per customer name, or per postal address.\nAny promotions will be removed if returned goods means that the amended order would no longer qualify. For example we have an offer of \u00a310 off when you buy 3 or more. Should you return products so that your no longer qualifies, then your discount will also be removed.\nAll discount codes are valid against products only, any additional postage costs will not be counted, even if the total spend exceeds the voucher threshold."
