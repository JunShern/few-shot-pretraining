For example, the Mekong Delta rivers in Vietnam are so full of garbage (mostly discarded bits of plastic), that motorboats often get stuck because their engines get caught onto pieces of trash. The story is similar in China, Cambodia, Bangladesh, India\u2026 It starts at the individual scale and ends with massive industrial waste going into the rivers as well. And then we wonder why things like the Pacific Garbage Patch are such a serious issue in our world today."
