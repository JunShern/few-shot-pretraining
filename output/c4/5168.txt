This poem should be read often just to let us know how lucky we are to be free and to think of soldiers in half the world who are at war.\nWonderful sentiments Toss, I salute you. I read that poem with a tear in my eye and also thought of the original poster. Best Wishes to you Grammer, thinking of you and wishing you the very best.\nFantastic. Wishing you all the best Grammer.\nWell done Toss,a great reminder of how good Grammer's postings are. So lets have more Grammer, when you can.\nMerry Christmas, to one and all. Thanks for another year of wonderful posts from everyone.\nLove to all, especially Grammer!\nI posted my greetings in the wrong string by the look of it - what's new says all of you.\nGood Health and Happiness in 2018.\nNo you didn't we did. Anyway Christmas can be so nice no harm to say it twice,HAPPY CHRISTMAS ALL."
