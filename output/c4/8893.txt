In fact, winter depression and seasonal affective disorder (SAD) can have the opposite effect \u2013 causing feelings of hopelessness, suicidal thoughts or actions, and withdraw from social activities.\nAccording to the Yale School of Medicine, those living in Canada and the northern United States are up to eight times more likely to suffer from SAD than people living in the southern U.S. where the sun shines more in the winter months.\nSounds like a good excuse to go south for the winter, as so many residents of northern regions do. But does all that sunshine and warm weather really help with avoiding depression?\nGetting out into the sunshine may feel good, but the science behind that feeling can be complicated. First, sunshine has been shown to add Vitamin D to the body. \u201cVitamin D is unique because it can be made in the skin from exposure to sunlight,\u201d according to the Journal of Pharmacology and Pharmacotherapeutics. There are numerous health benefits to having an adequate amount of Vitamin D, including helping reduce depression, heart disease and cognitive impairment.\nA lack of Vitamin D can also cause the disease rickets, which is especially concerning among elderly people. Rickets can cause muscle weakness, leading to falls and fractures.\nIn addition to Vitamin D, sunlight prompts the body to create another helpful hormone called serotonin. According to Healthline, \u201cSunlight cues special areas in the retina, which triggers the release of serotonin.\u201d This hormone helps improve mood and help promote calmness. In fact, the absence of serotonin has been related to depression and other mental health concerns.\nAccording to a recent article in USA Today, retirees should think about the kind of lifestyle they want \u2013 whether that\u2019s spending time with people your same age, full of amenities like walking trails or golf courses, or close to entertainment like theater, sporting events or restaurants.\nRegardless of where you spend your golden years after you retire, one thing is for certain: you need to view your retirement as a change in your lifestyle \u2013 not just ending a job. It\u2019s not just a paycheck you leave behind when you retire \u2013 you also lose part of your identity, your daily interaction with co-workers, and some place to get up and go to every morning.\nMake new social connections. To stave off loneliness, which can lead to depression, it\u2019s important to establish new social network which can help both your mental and physical health. Find someone or a group of people who share(s) the same interests and make a plan to get together.\nGet active & find hobbies. Playing a new sport (pickleball or golf are popular options), traveling, playing cards, or finding a new activity with others can help you build new friendships (or reconnect with old ones).\nCreativity is key. \u201cActivating your creative side can help keep your brain healthy\u201d according to the blog. Write, paint, woodwork, teach Sunday school, play an instrument \u2013 the possibilities are endless.\nNever stop learning. Keeping your brain active and constantly learning is important for brain health. So, read, take a class, learn how to play Sudoku, or do something to keep your mind active and constantly evolving.\nGetting more sunshine can be easier said than done. For people who live in the northern half of the U.S., getting outside in the winter can be problematic due to snow, extreme cold weather, or ice.\nRegardless of where you spend your retirement, keeping physically, mentally and socially active will keep you happy, healthy and young at heart."
