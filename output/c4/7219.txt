    "text": "The second largest size within the range, the 8ft x 15ft Zenith greenhouse by Elite offers a large space for a wide range of plants, flowers and vegetables.\nStarting with the framework, the Zenith range makes use of a thick aluminium frame, reinforced with its unique Titan mainframe and cantilever roof supports. Due to the exceptional strength of the structure, the roof has been designed to be as tall as possible, reaching a mega 10ft ridge height, offering plenty of height for tall growing vines such as beans and tomatoes and aiding with the overall airflow inside.\nIncluded with your new greenhouse are a host of accessories normally sold as optional extras with other brands, meaning that there's a lot of value to be had with this package. You'll find not one, not two, but four roof vents as standard, each with an automatic roof opener device which opens and closes the vents automatically depending on the temperature.\nCrestings, finials and bar capping all help to create a more traditional, finished-looking greenhouse while the integral guttering and downpipes allow rainwater to be collected and reused on your plants.\nAll in all, it's a fabulous greenhouse that has so much to offer to an amateur or novice gardener.\n*One automatic opener per roof vent supplied as standard. Additional roof vents purchased separately will require additional paid automatic openers.\nWe offer two different types of glazing: 4mm Toughened Glass or 6mm Twin-Wall Polycarbonate Glazing.\nAs Toughened Glass is included in your frame price as the standard no extra cost option, the additional cost for Polycarbonate Glazing is indicated below."
