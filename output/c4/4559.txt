    "text": "Since I was a little girl I\u2019ve been a storyteller, a writer, and a dreamer, always planning to one day be an *author*\u2014that very person you imagine when you whisper the two melodic syllables aloud\u2026but it\u2019s only been in the last few years that I\u2019ve honed my focus, and in the last year that it\u2019s become even more to me: my soul, my heart, my love, and my passion.\nSo a few weeks ago, just after my first post (\u201cThe Journey\u201d), I had an inspiring phone conversation with my mother. We discussed my freshly tuned writing focus, and like a breathless girl admitting her crush I told her my plans\u2014Kyresa, the other books, the blog, the short stories, the networking, all of it. My mother listened patiently, and after a few proud mom compliments she said, in a dreamily soft voice, \u201cHoney, you have it figured out now! You are no longer just doing\u2026you are finally living.\u201d I nearly burst into tears with her sweet words of encouragement, because I realized my mom was right.\nFollow your dreams, and live them.\nFor the first time in my life, I feel like the stars I\u2019ve always reached for are possible. The dreams I\u2019ve always had are right there, at my fingertips, and I will no longer just do; I will live. I have never been more motivated. I have never been so happy and so fulfilled. I truly feel like I have realized what my life means to me, and that I am going to make all of my dreams happen by living this passion. My passion. Tough day, illness, heartache, bills\u2014none of it matters anymore. I have a goal, a dream, and a wish, and it is to live this one life as thoroughly as I can by letting my fingers run across this keyboard as excitedly and quickly as my imagination dreams it, and as rapidly as my heart beats through it.\nI have found my peace through writing. You, dear reader\u2014you may be there already, or you may be on the path to finally reaching everything that you dream as well. Whatever the case, I encourage you to follow your heart, to unburden your soul, and to find that true passion within yourself to not just do\u2026but live.\nTo finally live your fantasy.\nThis entry was posted on Saturday, March 31st, 2012 at 8:35 am\tand tagged with Imagination, journey, Musings, Writing and posted in Musings from the Heart, On Writing.\tYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.\nFollowing your dreams? Fabulous! A partner in crime (plus we have that teacher link, to boot). I wish more people would be able to find their passion and run with it, as opposed to just going through the motions\u2026glad you\u2019ve already embraced your true love, Rebecca!\nNow if I can just get paid for it :-).\nDouble yaaay us! Thank you for the compliment Regina, especially since I follow your blog and am so inspired by YOU! I\u2019m so flattered. Keep dreaming and writing!"
