We have tentative future dates on May 14 and May 26. Stay tuned!\nOur team had scheduled their day as any other, meeting at 8 a.m. and expecting to meet with management around 9:30. We were notified by the employer, at the last minute the evening before, that they would not be ready to meet until 1:30 p.m. They gave no further movement regarding their financial package, which remains a 0% wage increase and a one-year contract.\nThe contract expired yesterday, March 31. Since WhidbeyHealth is a public entity, we are covered by an \"Evergreen year\" concept. This means the contract automatically renews (rolls over) for one year. Therefore, all your rights and benefits remain intact.\nWe have pushed hard at each negotiation session to get language in the contract for successorship. Our proposal would offer protection for the bargaining unit if the hospital were ever purchased by another entity. That purchaser would be required to work with the union and keep the collective bargaining agreement. We continue to press on this important issue.\nOur WSNA Negotiating Team of RNs from WhidbeyHealth met with hospital management on March 20, 2019, for our fourth session.\nAfter waiting all this time, management came back with a proposal for 0% wage increases and a 1-year contract, plus no consideration for our other premiums. This is extremely disappointing and we expressed our shock and outrage to Management.\nManagement also repeated that there is not a staffing problem at this Hospital, despite the staffing concerns we have repeatedly raised.\nWe have reached agreement on some articles but still have a long way to go. When pressed, management was forced to acknowledge that overtime continues to be a problem in the MAC and have backed off their proposal to remove the overtime premium.\nPTO DONATIONS: We need your help!

Per Diem nurses would have the opportunity after FTEs (management could schedule Per Diems for up to two shifts per schedule without first offering the shifts to FTEs).\nManagement continues to fall short of the mark in other areas that are of great importance to our bargaining team, such as safe staffing, workplace violence and successorship to protect nurses' working conditions in the event the hospital changes ownership. We are holding firm on all of these areas since they are very important to patient safety and nurse safety.\nManagement also made a proposal to take away the Memo of Understanding that offers a premium to MAC nurses who work at least (30) minutes beyond their shift. We are waiting to hear from MAC nurses as to their thoughts on this proposal.\nManagement still has not made any economic proposals.\nWe again discussed precepting and orienting. Thank you to those of you who shared your understanding of the difference in these two concepts. We would like to hear from more of you, though. Please contact one of the negotiation team members or the WSNA nurse rep.\nOur next bargaining session with the employer will take place on Wednesday, March 20.\nWe encourage all Whidbey RNs to stay involved and let us know if you have ongoing questions or concerns. Your priorities are the driving force behind our negotiations, and we are striving to persist until we reach an agreement that is fair and deserving.\nOur team of WSNA registered nurses from WhidbeyHealth met with the management team for our second session on Friday, March 1.\nWe spent time attempting to discuss the difference between Precepting and Orienting.

Stay tuned for updates as each session continues.\nAnd Terri Williams, MS, RN; WSNA Nurse Rep, twilliams@wsna.org / 206-575-7979, ext. 3058.\nThe WSNA local unit officers and leadership team are preparing for contract negotiations. Your input and participation are vital in getting the best possible contract for WhidbeyHealth RNs. Here\u2019s how you can be involved.\nWe need to hear from ALL of the nurses at WhidbeyHealth. Please take this survey now.\nThe survey will be available until Dec. 3.\nConsider becoming a member of the negotiating team \u2013 we need nurses at the table to voice the interests for everyone!\nContinue to watch the WhidbeyHealth homepage and your email for updates and information.\nQuestions? Contact one of our Local Unit Officers or WSNA Nurse Representative Terri Williams, MS, RN at 206-575-7979, ext. 3058.\nOur stance is that RNs can make the decision as to whether or not they want to receive the flu vaccine. If the nurse refuses immunization, we agree with the CDC recommendation of wearing a mask in patient care (6 ft from patients) areas only. Breakrooms, hallways, parking lots, cafeteria, etc. are not considered patient care areas.\nWSNA is committed to advocating for the health of nurses, patients and the communities they serve. Because of this commitment, WSNA strongly recommends that all nurses and other health care providers be vaccinated against all influenza viruses. WSNA strongly supports and urges voluntary efforts that aim for 100 percent vaccination rates, including annual education and implementation of comprehensive influenza vaccination programs for all health care providers.\nWSNA supports enforcement of existing federal and state regulations to ensure that all employers meet the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) andOccupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) requirements for influenza prevention.\nThe policy must cover all health care settings and health care workers. This includes all settings such as hospitals, long-term care facilities, adult boarding homes, outpatient clinics, etc. Health care workers must include those licensed and unlicensed who work in close proximity to patients, (e.g. nurses, emergency responders, physicians, housekeeping personnel, health care secretarial staff, etc).\nEmployers must ensure that appropriate protection and safety measures are in place to provide a safe workplace environment for nurses and health care workers.\nEmployers must ensure that influenza vaccines are available and offered to every health care worker annually at convenient times and locations. The employer must not discriminate against or discipline nurses for the appropriate use of sick time.\nIf a declination form is required for vaccination, the nurse must be able to sign the form confidentially; that is, the nurse must not be required to divulge personal health information or declare the reason(s) for refusal of a vaccine. The employer must not discriminate against or discipline a nurse for opting out.\nThe employer must comply with CDC and OSHA Guidelines must be used for prevention, protection, and safety of nurses and patients.\nNursing care requires continuous patient assessment, critical thinking, expert nursing judgment, advocating on behalf of our patients and educating patients and their families. These activities are the essence of nursing care and are critical factors in avoiding preventable complications, injuries and avoidable deaths.\nWhen staffing levels are too low, RNs are frequently forced to compromise the care they give to their patients. Unsafe nurse staffing is a dangerous practice that leads to medical errors, poorer patient outcomes and nursing injuries as well as burnout. Ensuring safe nurse staffing must continues to be a top priority for all nurses.\nIn 2017, the Washington state legislature passed the Patient Safety Act, addressing this top issue of safe staffing. The bill creates greater transparency and accountability for nurse staffing plans and the work of nurse staffing committees in hospitals. The new bill holds hospitals more accountable for staffing in order for YOU to deliver safe, high quality care to their patients.\nThe \u201cprocess\u201d mentioned above is the Assignment Despite Objection (ADO) form. We strongly suggest that you complete an (ADO) form regarding any staffing concerns and issues. These are utilized for real-time tracking efforts, in addition to discussing them with management at both the monthly Staffing Committee and Conference Committee.\nTo read more regarding other aspects of the new Staffing Law that affect you, click here.\n19.1 Staffing. The parties agree to cooperate in an effort to insure an appropriate relationship between patient care needs and staffing levels. These shall be appropriate subjects for WGHWSNA Conference Committee consideration. A nurse questioning the level of staffing on her/his unit shall communicate this concern to her/his immediate supervisor who will utilize available management resources to attempt to resolve the situation. When appropriate, the nurse should use appropriate forms to document the situation, a copy to be given to the supervisor, and the nurse to receive a written response. Standards established by the Centers for Medicare/Medicaid and Washington State Department of Health (\u201cDOH\u201d) shall be considered relevant criteria for determining appropriate staffing levels.\nIf you have any questions, please contact one of your Local Unit Officers or your WSNA Nurse Rep.\nHappy 2018! Since it\u2019s the beginning of a new year, and as a reminder, we wanted to share the contract language regarding low census. There are two areas of the contract you should be aware of: Art. 11.2 Low Census and the Memorandum of Understanding between Whidbey General Hospital (\u201cHospital\u201d) and the Washington State Nurses Association (\u201cAssociation\u201d) on page 32.\nA request is when a nurse offers to take low census. The offer is always initiated by the nurse and the requesting nurse is not considered a volunteer.\nA volunteer is when a nurse accepts the Hospital\u2019s offer to take low census. The offer must be initiated by the Hospital and communicated to the individual nurse verbally or in writing (MLC).\nWe suggest you keep records of your MLC/VLC in order to take advantage of the (48) hour cap per six month period!\nThe Safe Staffing Committee (per Safe Nurse Staffing law, 2008) has not met since October 2015. WSNA and Management are working collaboratively to reinstate this committee. Per the WSNA/WhidbeyHealth Local Unit Rules (By-laws), members of the committee are appointed by the Executive Committee/Local Unit Officers.\nIf you have any questions regarding the Safe Staffing Committee, please contact Terri Williams, MS, RN; WSNA Nurse Rep at twilliams@wsna.org.\nThank you for participating in this very important process to advocate for quality care, patient safety and your fellow nurses!\nWe extend a heartfelt Thank You to our out-going Officer Patricia (PC) Cable for her time, hard work and efforts representing the Bargaining Unit over the last many years!

Through much hard work and with the unwavering support of the bargaining unit, we convinced Management to withdraw its dangerous, intermittent rest break proposal. We also reached agreement that ensures that a functioning preceptor program will be maintained and that the preceptor premium will be increased to $1.50 per hour. However, there is much more work to be done. Management still has some very troubling proposals on the table and has not agreed to reasonable proposals that we have offered.\nWSNA has proposed daily overtime for several units that currently are not on this pay system. Your peers in these departments are frequently held over beyond the end of their shifts. Unlike most of you, they do not receive overtime when Management keeps them working beyond the end of their scheduled shifts. This practice, we believe, leads to inappropriate or over scheduling of patients. Nurses deserve predictability and a reasonable expectation that their shifts will end on time so they can go home to their families and life outside of work. Patients deserve caregivers who have not worked long, unexpected hours. Management has said \u201cNO\u201d to a WSNA\u2019s reasonable proposal that is afforded to most of the nurses at the hospital. Nor have they offered ANY solution to chronic overtime which is not good for nurses or patients.\nThe wages for nurses at WGH are far below those of WSNA nurses at nearby facilities. WSNA has proposed wage increases to make WGH more competitive in recruiting and retaining nurses and to make the wage increases retroactive to the expiration date of the contract (4/1/15). Under Management\u2019s proposal, nurses would not receive any retroactive pay for the period since the current contract expired on March 31, 2015. When St. Joseph\u2019s, United General and Island Hospital recently settled their contracts after their expiration dates, Hospital leadership did the right thing and agreed to retroactive compensation. WGH Management thinks differently and wants to take financial advantage of prolonged negotiations.\nMonitoring WSNA Meeting at Any Time? Insisting on Prior Review of WSNA Communications with WGH Nurses?\nAnyone with even the most basic understanding of proper labor-management relations should understand how inappropriate these proposals are. Although Management later withdrew these specific proposals after WSNA objected, it is STILL insisting, even after 12 bargaining sessions, on unnecessary constraints on WSNA\u2019s ability to meet with nurses at the Hospital. During these negotiations, even though Management has not indicated any past issue with our use of meeting rooms, we have offered several proposals to alleviate concerns they may have. Still, Management says our accommodations are not enough. Such behavior at the table causes us to question Management\u2019s desire to get a timely resolution. We can only wonder why Management is still fixated on a non-issue when there are other real issues regarding patient care that need addressing.\nManagement continues to propose to handcuff newly hired nurses to their positions for six months during which they would be prohibited from applying for any other position at WGH. WGH struggles to retain nurses. Why would we strip a nurse of finding a good fit at WGH? Suppose WGH hires an experienced ICU nurse into the medical surgical unit and five months later a position opens up in the ICU. The nurse would have preferred a position at WGH in ICU, but no such position was open when she applied. And suppose five months later a position opens up in the ICU. Under Management\u2019s proposal, that nurse would be prohibited from even applying for a job for which he or she would be very qualified. The nurse may decide to leave WGH to take an ICU position at another facility. Opportunity lost. Management should focus on improving things at WGH so that nurses want to stay, not because they have to stay.\nRather than focusing on improving core staffing so that reliance of per diems is lessened, Management continues to insist that reserve nurses be required to actually work more frequently, rather than just be available to work. However, reserve nurses already work a high number of hours, and Management\u2019s proposal may well cause reserve nurses to leave WGH to look for work elsewhere where they would have greater flexibility that is a large part of the appeal of reserve positions.\nAs you can see, Management is still proposing substandard wages and seeks to impose conditions designed to handcuff nurses to their jobs rather than focusing on finding ways to make nurses want to stay here. Meanwhile, they refuse to make commitments regarding training appropriate working conditions. If Management really wants to move forward and improve its relationship with its nurses and WSNA, it should evidence that by coming to the table with proposals designed to address and resolve serious issues, rather than with mere platitudes.\nWe go back to the table on January 13th.\nOn September 24, your fellow nurses on the WSNA team bargained with Management for the 12th day, including 3 days with the assistance of a state-appointed mediator. Whidbey General Hospital has indicated that it is encouraged by the progress thus far, that protracted negotiations are not cause for concern and that multiple ULPs filed by WSNA are par for the course. We, however, believe such sentiment does not do justice to the gravity of the issues at stake at WGH and is a mere Platitude. And while we are told that the administration wishes to move forward and renew a positive relationship with WSNA and the nurses at WGH, we remain concerned that the proposals that Management continues to insist upon at the table do not reflect a serious commitment to address issues that affect the Hospital, its nurses and its patients. This is a shame. With new leadership at the helm, now is the perfect time, not for platitudes, but for WGH to address serious issues seriously and to repair its image with the community. We are concerned that this may be an opportunity lost.\nInstead of giving us meaningful solutions to several issues that remain unresolved, Management seems to be fixated on things that have not been issues, responds with mere platitudes to real problems and insists that WSNA simply withdraw all grievances and unfair labor practices without offering any meaningful resolution of the issues that gave rise to the litigation.\nMonitoring WSNA meetings at any time?! Insisting on prior review of WSNA communications with WGH nurses?! Anyone with even the most basic understanding of proper labor-management relations should understand how inappropriate these proposals are. Although Management later withdrew these specific proposals after WSNA objected, it is still insisting, even after 12 bargaining sessions, on unnecessary constraints on WSNA\u2019s ability to meet with nurses at the Hospital. During these negotiations, even though Management has not indicated any past issue with our use of meeting rooms, we have offered several proposals to alleviate concerns they may have. Still, Management says our accommodations are not enough. Such behavior at the table causes us to question Management\u2019s desire to get a timely resolution. We can only wonder why Management is still fixated on a non-issue when there are other real issues regarding patient care that need addressing.\nAfter 12 bargaining sessions, Management is still insisting upon eroding your ability to get meaningful rest breaks. Your fellow nurses on the bargaining team realize how physically and mentally demanding nursing is. Adequate rest is vital to the well-being of nurses and for the safety of our patients. The current contract requires that nurses receive an uninterrupted 15-minute rest break every four hours. Instead of ensuring proper staffing so that nurses may take uninterrupted 15-minute breaks as required by the contract, Management wants to lower the bar and allow for \u201cintermittent\u201d rest breaks. That\u2019s right; instead of getting one meaningful 15-minute rest break, Management wants to give \u201cbreaks\u201d of much shorter duration. How much \u201crest\u201d do you get during a short pit-stop to the bathroom or a quick dash to drink some water? As long as these few minutes of \u201crest\u201d here and there total 15 minutes in each 4-hour period, that\u2019s all the \u201crest\u201d you would be entitled to. Think about that when you are working a long, difficult shift. Think about how that could impact the quality of care that you provide to your patients. Rather than addressing staffing so that nurses may take uninterrupted 15-minute breaks as required by the contract, Management wants to lower the bar and allow for \u201cintermittent\u201d rest breaks. WGH patients and nurses deserve better.\nManagement simply has not lived up to its obligation regarding staffing. In fact, just a few months ago the Washington State Department of Health found that Whidbey General Hospital violated the state\u2019s \u201cSafe Nurse Staffing\u201d law, created in 2008 to ensure that hospitals and nurses work together to develop nurse staffing plans adequate to keep patients safe. The Department of Health found that violation \u201cmay result in nurse staffing levels that do not support safe and effective patient care.\u201d Given Management\u2019s poor track record in this regard, we need stronger staffing language. Management simply says \u201cNo\u201d and offers no solution.\nDuring negotiations in 2012, WSNA proposed that WGH implement a much-needed preceptor program that is commonplace at other facilities. A functioning preceptor program ensures, among other things, that nurses receive proper training and orientation under the guidance of more experienced nurses. It just makes sense for patient care. Despite what we felt was a very real and immediate need for the program, Management insisted that it needed until 2014 to implement the program. When negotiations were concluded, Management had agreed in writing to implement a preceptor program by January 1, 2014. Quite simply, Management did not abide by that commitment and still does not have a properly functioning preceptor program after all these years. WSNA has had to file an Unfair Labor Practice Complaint to force Management to live up to its agreement.\nNow, Management is insisting that we simply withdraw the ULP Compliant as part of negotiations without resolving the underlying preceptor issue. With apparent amnesia on the history of the preceptor issue and without a hint of irony, Management has also proposed that we can discuss the issue sometime in the future at Conference Committee. Remember the word of the day? Platitude. The time to resolve this issue is now. Given that Management broke the law regarding its staffing obligations and given that they failed to live up to their agreement during last negotiations to implement a preceptor program, we have little confidence that they will do anything meaningful to address the issue in a committee at some time in the future. So much for leadership and accountability. We are at a loss as to why Management is stumbling over this issue when it seems to work well at so many other facilities. We ask Management to offer a positive, meaningful solution this issue, rather than spending money to fight it.\nWSNA has proposed daily overtime for several units that currently are not on this pay system. Your peers in these departments are frequently held over beyond the end of their shifts. Unlike most of you, they do not receive overtime when Management keeps them working beyond the end of their scheduled shifts. This practice, we believe, leads to inappropriate or over scheduling of patients. Nurses deserve predictability and a reasonable expectation that their shifts will end on time so they can go home to their families and life outside of work. Patients deserve caregivers who have not worked long, unexpected hours. Management has said \u201cNo\u201d to WSNA\u2019s reasonable proposal that is afforded to most of the nurses at the hospital. Nor have they offered any solution to chronic overtime, which is not good for nurses or patients.\nAs you can see, Management is still proposing substandard wages and seeks to impose conditions designed to handcuff nurses to their jobs rather than focusing on finding ways to make nurses want to stay here. Meanwhile, they refuse to make commitments regarding training and staffing. If Management really wants to move forward and improve its relationship with its nurses and WSNA, it should demonstrate that by coming to the table with proposals designed to address and resolve serious issues, rather than with mere Platitudes.\nSpecial thanks to Gwen Parrick, PC Cable, Laura Black and community members Connie Cavin, Rita Doak, and Linda Beller for speaking directly to the board of commissioners and delivering the petition with >500 signatures on your behalf.

Updates on negotiations will be shared at the Rally!!\nRally The Troops Take Part In Your Community \"Rally-Q\"\nNow is the time to come together as nurses and a community to push negotiations forward for a better contract for Whidbey General nurses!\nJuly 20, 2015 \u2013 The Washington State Department of Health has found that Whidbey General Hospital is violating the state\u2019s \u201cSafe Nurse Staffing\u201d law, created in 2008 to ensure that hospitals and nurses work together to develop nurse staffing plans adequate to keep patients safe.\nIn addition to failing to implement the state staffing law, Whidbey General management has refused WNSA contract proposals regarding safe staffing during current negotiations.\nWhidbey General management has not followed through with its commitments to its nurses. For example, the Hospital failed to implement a preceptor program, which provides for crucial new skill development for nursing students and nurses under the guidance of more experienced nurses, as it agreed to do during its last contract negotiations with WSNA.\nRegistered Nurses at Whidbey General have gathered hundreds of signatures on petitions of support from community members and are planning a community barbecue and rally in support of the RNs for early August.\nThe wages for nurses at WGH are below those of WSNA nurses at nearby facilities. WSNA has proposed wage increases to make WGH more competitive in recruiting and retaining nurses. Management has proposed that nurses would get a guaranteed across-the-board wage increase of only 1.75% over three years. This guaranteed increase would make wages at WGH even LESS competitive over the next few years because WSNA-area hospitals have agreed to much larger guaranteed wage increases. Moreover, under Management\u2019s proposal, nurses would not receive any retroactive pay for the period since the current contract expired on March 31, 2015. When St. Joseph\u2019s, United General and Island Hospital recently settled their contracts after their expiration dates, Hospital leadership did the right thing and agreed to retroactive compensation. WGH Management thinks differently and wants to take financial advantage of prolonged negotiations.\nManagement is even going one bold step further and proposing to condition the nurses\u2019 non-guaranteed wage increases on the Hospital meeting operating margin targets and the nurses meeting certain unspecified performance targets. If the Hospital doesn\u2019t meet these goals, nurses will not get their full potential wage increases. We can only assume that Management believes that WGH nurses have all the tools and staffing support for the Hospital to meet these goals. Meanwhile, nurses tell us about staffing problems at WGH, and Management refuses to agree to substantive, meaningful approaches to staffing problems. Management fails to recognize that nurses are professionally driven and that, given the proper tools and support, provide exemplary care. Other area WSNA hospitals understand this and do not hold their nurses\u2019 compensation hostage as part of a misguided pay practice. They guarantee full wage increases for the life of their contracts while facing similar Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement constraints as WGH. We fear that Management\u2019s dangerous new approach to compensation will give WGH nurses yet another reason to look elsewhere for employment where they can earn a better wage and count on guaranteed wage increases that are higher than what Management is proposing. Whidbey General\u2019s claimed financial issues are not a result of overpaying its nurses. One only has to look at the headlines of newspaper articles over the past several years to see that WGH has incurred financial harm through missteps unrelated to nursing salaries. Whidbey\u2019s financial presentation shows money is being spent, it\u2019s just not being allocated to one of its most valuable resources, its nursing staff. Whidbey General nurses are already being paid below area market wages. Management\u2019s wage proposal will leave nurses even further behind in the market over the life of the contract. Recruitment and retention is of dire concern and the effect is already being seen with difficulty recruiting and the need for traveling staff. Retention has also been an issue. Additionally, working conditions and culture have changed. Nursing indicators have plummeted during the life of the contract under current nursing leadership.\nYour fellow nurses on the bargaining team realize how physically and mentally demanding nursing is. Adequate rest is vital to the well-being of nurses and for the safety of our patients. The current contract requires that nurses receive an uninterrupted 15-minute rest break every four hours. Instead of ensuring proper staffing so that nurses may take uninterrupted 15-minute breaks as required by the contract, Management wants to lower the bar and allow for \u201cintermittent\u201d rest breaks. That\u2019s right; instead of getting one meaningful 15-minute rest break, Management wants to give \u201cbreaks\u201d of much shorter duration. How much \u201crest\u201d do you get during a short pit-stop to the bathroom or a quick dash to drink some water? As long as these few minutes of \u201crest\u201d here and there total 15 minutes in each 4-hour period, that\u2019s all the \u201crest\u201d you would be entitled to. Think about that when you are working a long, difficult shift. Think about how that could impact the quality of care that you provide to your patients.\nYour WSNA team came to the table with several common sense proposals of additional requirements to ensure proper orientation, training and equipment for nurses to do their jobs. Management says \u201cNO\u201d to our proposals.\nInstead, Management has come to the table with proposals that erode the current contract. Management is proposing to implement an undetermined training program requiring nurses to repay money if they do not meet unknown Management criteria for successful completion. Nurses would be on the hook to the tune of thousands of dollars for not successfully completing the program (as determined by Management) or for leaving early. This is concerning. Moreover, during the last negotiations, Management agreed in writing to implement a preceptor program by January 1, 2014. Quite simply, Management failed to live up to this commitment, and WSNA was forced to utilize the grievance procedure to get Management to do what it agreed to do. Given Management\u2019s abysmal track record with the preceptor program, we have little confidence in Management developing good training programs. It seems that Management\u2019s approach to retention is to handcuff nurses to their jobs by forcing them to pay back thousands of dollars if they leave before completing an unspecified training program. WSNA believes recruitment and retention of competent specialty staff starts with competitive wages, good staffing, a robust education system, proper orientation and training, and the availability of the proper equipment and technology to do the job. Offering a job or training that comes with the danger of repayment of thousands of dollars is a deterrent, not an incentive. We should focus on an environment that makes nurses WANT to stay at Whidbey General Hospital and not make them feel that they HAVE to stay.\nWSNA has proposed that staffing levels be negotiated, determined and placed into the contract. Management has said \u201cNO.\u201d Staffing continues to be an issue. WSNA has filed a complaint with the Department of Health for the Hospital\u2019s failure to abide by the modest requirements of the Nurse Staffing law. The hospital continues to fail to follow the Nurse Staffing law. Unsafe staffing puts your license at risk.\nWSNA has proposed daily overtime for several units that currently are not on this pay system. Your peers in these departments are frequently held over beyond the end of their shifts. Unlike most of you, they do not receive overtime when Management keeps them working beyond the end of their scheduled shifts. This practice, we believe, leads to inappropriate or over scheduling of patients. Nurses deserve predictability and a reasonable expectation that their shifts will end on time so they can go home to their families and life outside of work. Management has said NO to a reasonable solution that is afforded to most of the nurses at the hospital.\nThe hospital wants to handcuff you to a new position should you change shifts or positions, stripping you of your ability to move for months to a more suitable position should one open up. Why would you be expected to forfeit your seniority and right to a position for a period of time? Why would the hospital want you to stay tied to a position that may not be a good fit?\nPlease stay tuned for further updates and information on how to stay informed and involved. Tell Management to stop the attacks and give us a fair contract now so that we all can focus on the practice of nursing!\nIf you have not already done so, please click here to fill out the survey.\nWSNA recently grieved and won a grievance involving non-payment of Preceptor Pay which nurses are entitled to under 8.8 of the CBA. You may be entitled to back pay. If you have served as a preceptor at any time between January 1, 2014 to present and have not been paid preceptor pay while serving as a preceptor, please contact me with the dates and hours you served as a preceptor. A nurse is a preceptor when, \u201cplanning, organizing, implementing, and evaluating the new skill development of a nurse.\u201d An example would be teaching conscious sedation to a nurse. This also includes precepting of students whose instructor is not on the unit doing the teaching. Please respond no later than May 31, 2015. Moving forward, be sure to record preceptor pay on your time card. Contact WSNA or your Grievance Officer if pay is denied.\nNOW is the time to BE INFORMED. Please join us for important updates on negotiations and other issues that may affect your working conditions. See you there!\nImagine you are a nurse who has been disciplined or terminated and your employer refuses to provide the documents to support their allegations. WSNA is troubled that Whidbey General Hospital has refused to provide information in such a case as well as other requested information. Therefore, we have filed an Unfair Labor Practice with the Public Employment Relations Commission (PERC).\nPlease join us for a Local Unit meeting in the Board Room to hear updates about this important topic as well as important negotiations updates.\nPotential Wage REDUCTIONS. Management has proposed that it be able to try to REDUCE your current wages during the life of the contract.\nTying wages to hospital\u2019s operating margins and nurse metrics. Nurses are not responsible for the Hospital\u2019s current economic state [the Hospital pays its nurses below-market wages] or the poor patient satisfaction scores, yet management wants to tie your wages to unspecified nursing metrics. Those numbers have plummeted over the past years under current leadership.\nThe hospital wants to handcuff you to a new position should you change shifts or positions, stripping you of your ability to move for six months to a more suitable position should one open up .\nThe hospital does not want to pay daily overtime to some nurses even though they frequently hold them over their scheduled shifts.\nThe hospital does not want to provide for uninterrupted breaks and instead wants intermittent breaks because it will \u201chelp them with staffing\u201d! This is a safety concern and erodes your current contract which provides for uninterrupted breaks.\nThe hospital wants to force nurses to repay training (up to $6,000 and perhaps more) if they don\u2019t meet hospital determined criteria for successfully completing programs. This is concerning, especially in light of the fact that the hospital has been unable to execute a functioning preceptor program which was bargained for in the current contract.\nManagement has said \u201cNO\u201d to our common-sense proposals to make sure nurses are adequately trained and oriented and have the proper equipment to do their jobs safely.\nNOW is the time to get involved. Please plan on attending one of the follow information sessions in the Board Room for further updates: May 4, 2015 - 1:30p \u2013 2:30p, 7:30p \u2013 8:30p or May 5, 2015 \u2013 7:30a-8:30a. Our next session is Monday, April 20th. Please watch your mail, email and Local Unit webpage for further updates. We will see everyone at the meetings in early May.\nYour team met again with Management on 3/26 and 3/31 for negotiations. Our next sessions are scheduled for 4/13 and 4/20.\nWe were successful in seeing Management withdraw several proposals that would have made it easier for management to fire nurses.\nWages continue to be a difficult subject. Despite being underpaid relative to area hospitals, Management has proposed wage increases of 0% for year one, 0% for year two and 0.75% for year three. This follows the current CBA which had minimal pay increases. Your team believes the hospital\u2019s financial issues are not related to paying nurses a fair wage. The current proposal makes recruitment and retention difficult at best.\nPlease watch for further updates and information about how you can support your negotiation team!\nAnn Bell, PC Cable, Taylor Little, Bonnie Garcia, Laura Black, Kathy Cox, Dori Painter and Gwen Parrick.\nTwo sessions in and your team needs you to know what\u2019s already happened.\nHow do you keep in the loop about what\u2019s happening at the bargaining table?\nDo you want to know what administration proposed?\nStep 1: Show up to one of the following meetings to hear an update and find out what step 2 is.\nBe proactive and get your information directly from our negotiating team members.\nNegotiations have started. Your team members are Dori Painter, Kathy Cox, Gwen Parrick, Laura Black, Taylor Little, PC Cable, Bonnie Garcia, and Ann Bell.\nWe need YOUR HELP! Please be sure that we have your correct home and email address to ensure you get timely updates and to find out what you can do to support your team during this process!\nYour local unit webpage will have the most up-to-date information.
