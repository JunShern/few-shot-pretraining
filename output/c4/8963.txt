    "text": "You can look forward to your visit to the Gene Autry Oklahoma Museum. The museum guarantees to bring back old memories of your Western heroes or make new memories of a very special part of America's history.\nThe Gene Autry Oklahoma Museum holds an outstanding collection of memorabilia of Gene Autry, Roy Rogers, Rex Allen, Tex Ritter, Jimmy Wakely, Eddie Dean, and others who appeared in the much-loved musical Western movies of the 1930s and '40s.\nThe Museum is located in the renovated school building in the tiny town of Gene Autry, Oklahoma, named for the famous actor/singer/recording artist and businessman whose ranch bordered the town during his golden years in Hollywood.\nAs we celebrate the 100th anniversary of Gene Autry\u2019s birth and the centennial of the state of Oklahoma, it\u2019s an ideal time to visit the Museum. There\u2019s added excitement in the air this year as we pay special tribute to these heroes of the past and look to the future...and share the legacy of the singing cowboys with others.\nThe Museum is open each day, Monday through Saturday, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and is closed on Sundays. It is also closed the week between Christmas and New Year's Day each year.\nTo get to the Museum from Interstate 35, take exit 40 and go east on Highway 53 for five miles. Watch for the Museum sign on the right shortly after you pass the \"Melody Ranch\" campground and dirtbike facility (on the south side of Highway 53). Turn right (south) and go south 1.5 miles on Happy Trails Road. Turn east (left) on Tumbleweed Road and go about 1.8 miles east. You'll approach the museum from the back side of the building. Drive around the building, make a short turn to the left and park in front of the Museum.\nFrom north or east of Gene Autry, you'll approach the town from the east. Just after the railroad track, turn left (south) and travel a few blocks through the small town until you see the sign for the Museum telling you to turn right. Go up the hill until you see the Museum (across from the Baptist Church) and park in front of the building.\nThe museum welcomes tour groups of all types and sizes. They ask that you call or e-mail ahead of time."
