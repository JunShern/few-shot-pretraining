Then send us an email quoting \"Le Tr\u00e9port\" and telling us that you you saw this offer.\nThe little seaside town of Le Tr\u00e9port, in the Seine-Maritime department of Upper Normandy, is a fishing port as well as a popular seaside resort. In addition to good beaches, it's also home to acclaimed seafood restaurants. The town is a good destination for holidays and short breaks, as it's only 30 kilometres from the port of Dieppe.\nLe Tr\u00e9port lacks for nothing when it comes to shops, restaurants and entertainment. Its seafood restaurants are highly regarded, and there are plenty of lively caf\u00e9s and bars to enjoy as well. If you fancy a flutter, there's even a casino, right beside the beach. For a more traditional form of entertainment, on Tuesdays and Saturdays a lovely street market sets up its stalls. And for those planning to settle down long term in the town, all the usual services are available including doctors, schools and service industries. If monuments appeal to you, Le Tr\u00e9port doesn't disappoint. The Church of Saint Jacques, the Chapel of Saint Julien, the old presbytery and the Town Hall are all worth a look.\nYou can't fail to be impressed by the soaring white cliffs of Le Tr\u00e9port. You can take a ride up on the funicular railway to make the most of the views. Other sights to take in include the harbour and the lighthouse. It's also interesting to visit the fish market to bag yourself part of the catch of the day, or just to enjoy the lively activity that's so much a part of life in a French fishing village.\nThe town is well equipped with entertainment to keep tourists happy, so you won't be short of things to do in your leisure time. If a night at the casino isn't your bag, you can try sailing and swimming of course. Golfers have the choice of several accessible courses nearby. And, if you've got kids with you, let them enjoy a ride on the town's traditional carousel... always a winner!\nNear to the town you can find a couple of war cemeteries, and there's also the interesting Kahl-Burg Galleries, which were carved into rock by Nazis during the Second World War. Just a little further away is the Bay of Somme, and the art and history town of Dieppe. Mers les Bains and Eu, the other two towns that make up the Three Sisters with Le Tr\u00e9port, are also great to visit.\nIt's easy to get from the UK to Le Tr\u00e9port, however you want to travel.

The port of Dieppe is almost on the doorstep, while even Calais is only a couple of hours drive from its port and channel tunnel railway station. Le Havre is also within reach. Le Tr\u00e9port has its own railway station, so continuing by local train is easy to do. If you're driving, you'll find the nearest major roads to Le Tr\u00e9port are the A28 and A16.\nGiven that Le Tr\u00e9port is a chic resort that's popular with Parisians, you'd expect property to be on the expensive side. But take another look. An apartment for just 49,000 Euros? Tick. A three bedroom house, close to the sea, for 90,000 Euros? Tick! Hot property in Le Tr\u00e9port is cheaper than ever as we approach 2013.\nDo you know Le Tr\u00e9port better than we do?
