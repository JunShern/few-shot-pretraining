    "text": "The travel journalism skills below complement those taught through the curricula at MatadorU.\nActive observation is consciously looking for connections between what\u2019s visible in someone (their expressions, clothes, what they\u2019re doing) and invisible (their histories, upbringing, dreams, desires).\nThis is key, because within the gap between what\u2019s visible and invisible is often where the deepest, most credible, and most interesting stories are found.\nMythologizing place is looking at place as an abstraction. People mythologize place by (a) assigning some kind of abstraction [ex: virtue, nostalgia, chivalrousness, level of backwardness] to it, or similarly (b) assigning some kind of abstraction or quality to themselves because of it.\nMythologizing is the act of creating illusions about place. These illusions \u201cexist\u201d within the discrepancy between the concrete reality one experiences in a place (examples: how long one has lived there, where one lives \u2014 downtown, suburbs, outlying areas \u2014 one\u2019s role in the local economy / community) versus the image one has of his / her life there.\nMythologizing often happens when people look back at where they grew up, or lived, or once traveled, and feel certain emotions that didn\u2019t exist when they actually lived or traveled there.\nNo, actually it was much hotter when you were in Ecuador.\nThere exists however a much subtler and more pervasive form of commodifying where instead of concrete reality, the context of \u201cresources\u201d includes abstractions, associations, \u201cappeal,\u201d or \u201cimage.\u201d This is how travel marketers often look at place \u2014 as an image which needs to be packaged a certain way, transformed into a product to be \u201cpositioned\u201d in the market.\nMarketing constructions, such as the \u201ccasual imperative,\u201d the \u201chypothetical,\u201d and the \u201chey-let-me-show-you\u201d may unintentionally end up in travel writers\u2019 narratives, weakening them.\nThis is a fallacious argument known as confusing correlation and causation. Confusing correlations and causation works like this: A person says \u201c1. A occurs in correlation with B., 2. Therefore, A causes B.\u201d This isn\u2019t necessarily true.\nThe Ladder of Abstraction can help discern fallacious arguments.\nThe Ladder of Abstraction is a simple but powerful way to habituate a critical attitude towards language and writing.\nIt\u2019s also helpful to understand in the context of recognizing fallacious arguments, and, as we\u2019ll see next, the codification and commodfication of people / place / travel in writing.\nCodification and commodification, like fallacious arguments, are patterns that writers need to be aware of.\nScene-building is the central skill for writing strong narrative essays.\nThe easiest way to create scenes is to decide on a simple and single event to use as a narrative framework. This is the ongoing \u201cstory-line\u201d to which you\u2019ll add the facts, ideas, and information you want to convey.\nThe most obvious events already have a kind of inherent dramatic structure built in, like climbing a mountain or going on a date. Or, simply using the chronology of a day (\u201ca day in the life\u201d) or night, following the hours, the position of the sun / moon and other environmental factors, can be an easy and natural way to create scenes, especially for beginning writers.\nStories that seem real and alive contain multiple layers. Beginning travel writers, however, usually focus on one thing at a time. One way to add layers to your descriptions is to learn how to use object correlatives.\nObject correlatives work by giving the reader an image that works to (a) advance the plot, while (b) creating a correlation between whatever object or scene is described and the emotions of a particular character.\nOftentimes you may need to write dialogue in more than one language. Here are 5 techniques.\nSometimes you have a minor character or incident that doesn\u2019t fit well in the plot, but which, if included, would add a particularly rich detail or reinforce the story\u2019s overall theme. This is when you need to use anecdotes.\nMany travel writers use quotes in outdated ways.\nThere are dozens of English language words commonly misused.\nFor some travel writers, this is just about learning to recognize and avoid cliches.\nMost of the time it comes down to not wasting time. Here are 3 things you should never do, and then, 3 more.\nThis article has 2 examples of pitches that worked, and an analysis of why they did. Mainly it comes down to concision, connections, knowledge of and/or being a fan of (or best of all, on the radar screen of) whichever publication / editor you\u2019re querying.\nVisualizing what the editor will think when he / she receives your submission.\nAbility to deal with rejection \u2013 The best way to deal with rejection is to submit stories and pitches on an ongoing basis. That way, whether a piece is rejected or accepted, you\u2019re automatically sending a thank you note, then you\u2019re moving on, ready to resubmit to a different publication or to send a new story.\nLearning from each rejection \u2013 Another way of dealing with rejection is to look at each one as part of the learning process. You don\u2019t need to dwell on it, but simply ask yourself: Was the story really an ideal fit for the publication? Was the story as good as it could be or could you have done further edits? Was your pitch / cover letter as good as it could have been?\nContinuously researching new and relevant markets \u2013 The most obvious way is to search the links page at your favorite blog or magazine. Another way is to study the bios of the contributors at blogs and magazines where you\u2019re submitting. What other publications do they mention?\nAbility to stay organized so that you are continuously submitting pitches and multiple submissions \u2013 Previously we\u2019ve written about using a submissions log or a submission manager, basically a simple spreadsheet that allows you to quickly view and organize potential markets, contacts, and submissions.\nUnderstanding the hierarchy of getting published at different websites, magazines, and newspapers, and honestly assessing your position \u2013 The more you get published and the greater the readership of each blog, magazine, or newspaper that publishes your work, the higher up you move on the hierarchy, and the easier it will be for you to place work at bigger and better-paying markets.\nWhat magazines, blogs, and journals do you subscribe to? Read? Wish to send work to? If you\u2019re a US-based writer, have you considered sending work to markets outside the US?\nHere are 10 questions to ask yourself before submitting work to an editor.\nAlong with self-editing, learning to read your work aloud is a key skill to develop.\nWriters often have divergent professional and academic backgrounds that are difficult to present in a cohesive way. Learning how to craft a writer\u2019s resume can be key when applying for jobs and programs.\n* This post was originally published on October 21, 2010.\n* Get access to paid freelance travel writing opportunities and an active community of travel journalists by enrolling in the MatadorU Travel Writing program."
