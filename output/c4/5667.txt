    "text": "Attorneys for John Swallow were in court Wednesday arguing why the former Utah Attorney General\u2019s entire public corruption case should be thrown out.\nThe defense argues the state did not properly weed out attorney client privileged emails while pouring through evidence obtained from Swallow\u2019s personal computers.\nOn its face, this is the sort of defense argument that bothers a lot of people. People tend to have this vague background feeling that every criminal defendant probably did something wrong or they wouldn\u2019t have been charged in the first place. At trial, courts specifically instruct the jury they shouldn\u2019t think that, something that may have the effect of suggesting that line of reasoning to people who wouldn\u2019t otherwise think if it, but more importantly, a pretty good sign that sort of mindset is fairly common. It makes a dismissal for anything short of a compelling argument that the defendant is actually innocent pretty unappealing to most people.\nThere\u2019s also a pretty common sentiment among people that there\u2019s a lot of very shady, unethical stuff going on between lawyers and their clients. Maybe it\u2019s decades of television shows portraying lawyers as co-conspirators, accomplices after the fact who fix whatever trouble someone has gotten themselves into using often less than ethical means to do so.\nEither way I get questions about how to help someone get away with something after the fact almost as much as I get the classic, \u201chow can you defend those people?\u201d question when people find out what I do. When most people want to avoid punishment for themselves, they love the idea of a lawyer with some tricks up his sleeve. They hate it when other people appear to benefit in the same way.\nScott Williams, Swallow\u2019s attorney, wants his client\u2019s 11 felonies and 2 misdemeanors, ranging from racketeering and bribery to misuse of public money and tampering with evidence out, tossed out on the chance privileged attorney client emails have been reviewed by investigators.\n\u201cWould you want to sit at trial knowing they had 12,000 images of your defense strategy with your prior lawyer and hope they didn\u2019t use it against you?\u201d said Williams.\nWilliams argued going forward with the case at this point would be unconstitutional.\nLike it or not, defense strategy has a real impact on the outcome of cases. It\u2019s not that Swallow\u2019s lawyers were plotting anything illegal or unethical to get a good result for their client, but more likely that they were developing an approach to the case. Every case has strengths and weaknesses. It takes a lot of communication with a client to identify those areas. It takes even more to figure out how best to present strengths and address weaknesses. Most of that sort of planning incorporates information prosecutors would never know unless they interfered with the attorney-client relationship. Giving them that information would put the defense at a huge disadvantage.\nFurthermore, the prosecution\u2019s advantage wouldn\u2019t just be limited to the information they otherwise wouldn\u2019t have had along with the defense\u2019s strategy for litigating the case. Knowing that information, prosecutors could then go on to independently verify it. They could have investigators tie up the holes in their case defense was planning to exploit too. It wouldn\u2019t take long for prosecutors and law enforcement to be in a position where they were one step ahead of the defense in reality due to them violating privilege, but they would have a plausible explanation for how they got the same information lawfully. All they have to do is deny getting it from privileged communications and claim they got it some other way.\nThe prosecution, led by Assistant DA Chou Chou Collins, admits privileged emails were put in digital files labeled as such and sent out and in a massive data dump to the defense attorneys as a part of disclosure.\n\u201cIt was a mistake, but we would not be stupid enough if we were being sneaky and send it out and say here you go,\u201d said Collins.\nCollins argues the privileged files were sent by mistake, but have not been read by anyone working on the case where prosecutors and investigators have been digging through terabytes of information.\nReferencing a prior ruling, Collins told the judge, \u201cpotential opportunity to access doesn\u2019t count as intrusion.\u201d She reiterated that her team \u201cdid not actually read or view\u201d the information that was sent to the defense team deemed as privileged.\nThe defense is pushing for an evidentiary hearing to show Judge Hruby-Mills what the prosecutors may have seen, but the state says a hearing would be useless.\nIt sure would be convenient for prosecutors if that argument worked for all motions and at trial. I can just imagine the prosecutor telling the judge before a motion hearing, \u201cc\u2019mon your honor, the officer said he had cause for the stop, and he told the truth, so why waste his time testifying? Nothing is going to change.\u201d It would be even sillier at trial: \u201cyour honor, this is ridiculous. The case agent said he\u2019s guilty and has the facts to support that conclusion, so there\u2019s no need for a jury.\u201d Last time I checked, we don\u2019t do trial by affidavit in this country, though Swallow\u2019s prosecutor would clearly prefer it.\nWilliams said if there\u2019s even a chance the prosecution read the strategies between attorney and client, the case must be thrown out.\nWhat\u2019s especially interesting about that offer for a promise swap is the fact Swallow was the state\u2019s attorney general, the chief legal officer for all of Utah. The lowly trial prosecutor wants the judge to take her word for it, and yet she\u2019s prosecuting someone who was once the highest-ranking public lawyer in the jurisdiction because she isn\u2019t willing to take his word for it when it comes to his innocence.\nAt the end of the day, the prosecution\u2019s is probably right to say a hearing is unnecessary, but it\u2019s because the court should adopt the defense\u2019s bright line test and not for the reasons the prosecution claims. It may be painful to dismiss what might be a valid case, but the situation requires it.\nLike Collins explained, state witness after state witness will get up there and say they didn\u2019t see it, and it will likely be a waste of time with no Perry Mason moment. It isn\u2019t necessarily because they\u2019re telling the truth, however. It could just be that they\u2019re practiced liars. Swallow and his lawyers would have no way to fight that.\nIf I was the Judge, I\u2019d dismiss until the ADA changed their name to anything other than \u2018Chou Chou\u2019. With a name like that, she can\u2019t be trusted.."
