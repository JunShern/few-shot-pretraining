Credit: OSU/GEMM Lab.\nSnapping shrimp are small but mighty creatures: they\u2019re only a few inches long but are among the noisiest animals in the ocean. The loud cracking noise they make when snapping their claws sounds almost like a gunshot, and when enough shrimp snap at once, the din can be louder than the roar of a passenger jet flying overhead.\nSnapping shrimp are typically found in warm, shallow subtropical waters all over the world. But in 2016, researchers at Oregon State University discovered snapping shrimp inhabiting the Oregon coast for the very first time. They now suspect the crackling of the shrimp\u2019s claws may serve as a dinner bell for eastern Pacific gray whales residing in those waters.\nIn this episode, ocean acoustics specialist Joe Haxel describes the myriad of animals that contribute to Earth\u2019s underwater soundscape, including fish that growl and crabs that scratch their backs. Joe discusses how he and his colleagues identified snapping shrimp by their characteristic racket and what the presence of snapping shrimp means for marine life along the Oregon coast.\nThis episode was produced by Lauren Lipuma and mixed by Kayla Surrey.\nShane Hanlon: All right. I wanna talk about noises. I can even hear it now. Noises that really bother you all. What are some things you can\u2019t stand?\nLauren Lipuma: Nanci\u2019s voice. Just kidding.\nNanci Bompey: I\u2019m not offended. I\u2019m not offended. That\u2019s pretty much been my whole life so it is what it is.\nLauren Lipuma: You\u2019re very loud. It surprises me. It kind of shocks me.\nShane Hanlon: Yeah, one things folks probably obviously don\u2019t know, but when Nanci comes into the office at 8:30 in the morning, she\u2019s one of the most pleasant people at that time, but also one of the loudest. Just say to everyone, \u201cHello everyone.\u201d For me, since we\u2019re gonna stay on this theme, as the person who always has the headphones on when we\u2019re receding and making sure all the sound and everything is good, there\u2019s a lot of mouth noise you can call it.\nNanci Bompey: Coming from my microphone.\nShane Hanlon: In all fairness, people have told me that my voice isn\u2019t exactly the most pleasing thing. I have a voice that \u2026 let\u2019s call it for podcasting and public radio.\nNanci Bompey: Yeah, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard so that should be pleasing.\nLauren Lipuma: There\u2019s nothing wrong with your voice.\nNanci Bompey: Yeah, we\u2019ll see. I wasn\u2019t searching for compliments, but I will certainly take them.\nShane Hanlon: Okay. We\u2019re not here to talk about Nanci\u2019s voice.\nShane Hanlon: Maybe not. No, but we are here to talk about sound. I wanted to bring in Lauren Lipuma. Hi Lauren.\nShane Hanlon: Who has a really fascinating story for us. What do you got?\nLauren Lipuma: Yeah, so we\u2019re gonna talk about sounds in the ocean today. Last year, I met and interviewed a researcher who said studies the ocean soundscape.\nShane Hanlon: Oh, that sounds lovely.\nNanci Bompey: What is the ocean soundscape?\nLauren Lipuma: Well, actually, he will explain it to you, but it\u2019s pretty much all the ambient sounds that you hear in the ocean.\nNanci Bompey: I wonder if it sounds like my voice.\nShane Hanlon: I\u2019m sure it does not.\nJoe Haxel: My name is Joe Haxel. I\u2019m an Assistant Professor at Oregon State University, affiliated with the NOAA Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory Acoustic Program. I\u2019m based out of Newport, Oregon at the Hatfield Marine Science Center.\nJoe Haxel: My specialization is in ocean acoustics. I study sound underwater. Everything from looking at \u2026 I use it as a tool, essentially, to look at geophysical processes, look at some ecology in different habitats, as well as impacts from anthropogenic influences on sounds in the ocean.\nLauren Lipuma: What does studying the sound in the ocean tell us?\nJoe Haxel: Ocean acoustics is great. The analogy that I like to use is that we use optics in light as creatures on earth to navigate on land. We see the furthest with our eyes. We navigate, and find our food, and all the things we do, we primarily use our eyes. We do hear as well, but we can see a lot further than we can hear. The ocean, due to the physical properties of the water, light scatters really quickly, right, but sound doesn\u2019t. Sound actually travels really far so that\u2019s why most animals are acoustically oriented. They find their food and mates. They travel by sound. Also, as humans, we\u2019ve clued into that too. The Navy has been using it for a long time, acoustics, to do a lot of different naval operations, but even in the commercial sense, we use that.\nLauren Lipuma: What do you mean by that?\nJoe Haxel: A soundscape is essentially like the background song. If you were to close your eyes and just sit and listen, and what the ambient conditions are around there. There\u2019s contributions for all different kinds of sources. And particularly in the ocean, we have natural sound from wind and waves at the surface, and earthquakes, ice processes in the poles. There\u2019s anthropogenic sources like vessel traffic, fishing, activities, energy exploration. People looking for oil deposits. Drilling and pile driving. There\u2019s biological contributions from fish and mammals that are using that, like we discussed, to communicate and orient themselves.\nNanci Bompey: How do they record these underwater sounds?\nLauren Lipuma: Well, they actually just use an underwater microphone.\nNanci Bompey: That makes sense.\nLauren Lipuma: Yeah, it\u2019s called a hydrophone. It\u2019s basically a waterproof microphone and it\u2019s attached to a buoy so they can find it on the surface. They can leave it out there for a long time to record things over time or they can just get a snapshot of what they\u2019re hearing.\nNanci Bompey: I bet when they leave it out there, they hear all sorts of interesting things.\nShane Hanlon: Oh my gosh, I cannot not stop thinking Little Mermaid. It\u2019s like under the sea.\nNanci Bompey: Under the sea.\nLauren Lipuma: Under the sea.\nNanci Bompey: Look at this stuff, isn\u2019t it neat.\nLauren Lipuma: I still know every lyric to that song.\nNanci Bompey: I think I do too. Wow. We\u2019ll have to have a lyric \u2026 Like a singalong.\nNanci Bompey: Oh, a singalong one day.\nShane Hanlon: Oh goodness. Listeners, stay tuned for that one. But in the meantime, weird sounds.\nLauren Lipuma: What\u2019s the weirdest sound you\u2019ve ever recorded?\nJoe Haxel: Oh weird sounds. I would say the whales kind of make the weird stuff for me. Actually, fish. Fish make some really funky sounds too.\nJoe Haxel: You think these little fish. There\u2019s a fish called the Midshipman. It does this growl.\nLauren Lipuma: That\u2019s so weird.\nJoe Haxel: It\u2019s found in the Gulf of Mexico pretty extensively, but they can chorus and get really loud. They growl. It\u2019s this really \u2026 It\u2019s not a very big fish, but it\u2019s really low frequency, and strong, and loud. It\u2019s pretty impressive.\nJoe Haxel: The other thing is the blue whales, right. The blue whale \u2026 We were fortunate. This is a cool story. Typically, blue whales vocalize \u2026 Their fundamental frequency that they put out is really low. It\u2019s actually below what we can easily hear. Oftentimes, when you hear things that people play that are blue whale, they have to speed them up. We were lucky. We had recorders out off of Yaquina Head in Newport. A blue whale came in, probably within a kilometer or two of our recorder and was calling. It gave us this unprecedented, clear, awesome recording of a blue whale that you can hear without speeding up because it has the harmonic pieces in it that normally drop out as it propagates.\nJoe Haxel: We have this fantastic recording that we can play for people to listen. If you have the right speaker system, which doesn\u2019t take that big of a subwoofer, but you can shake the lights in the a quite easily with this call.\nLauren Lipuma: Wow, that\u2019s awesome.\nJoe Haxel: People hear it and they just \u2026 There\u2019s nothing that sounds like that. I can only imagine in my head, being in the ocean and hearing that, the thought must be, \u201cWhoa, what is that?\u201d The Starship Enterprise just came in the area, or something like that. I don\u2019t know.\nLauren Lipuma: What do you mean?\nJoe Haxel: And it makes noise.\nLauren Lipuma: Like on your equipment?\nJoe Haxel: Yeah, so dungeness crabs scratch their backs, essentially. They come up and if you have some hard frame or whatever, they will come and scratch. The gear that I had that it did it \u2026 It\u2019s not a constant thing so the crabs will come into an area. They like new things because they\u2019re scavengers. Something hits the bottom and they\u2019re like rushing over to see what it is. They would scrap and rub, and scrap, then it would go away after a few days.\nLauren Lipuma: What does that sound like really?\nJoe Haxel: Rubbing and scraping sound. It\u2019s just like you\u2019d think. Take a crab shell and rub it on metal, kind of thing.\nLauren Lipuma: That\u2019s awesome. That\u2019s so crazy.\nShane Hanlon: So no Little Mermaid.\nNanci Bompey: Unfortunately, they did not find Ariel.\nLauren Lipuma: No mermaids. No crabs. No King Triton with his trident.\nNanci Bompey: Ah, too bad.\nLauren Lipuma: No sea witches.\nShane Hanlon: Part of that world.\nLauren Lipuma: No, it\u2019s kind of sad.\nShane Hanlon: I know, but lots of really interesting noises. Snip snap bebop.\nLauren Lipuma: Snip snap bebop?\nShane Hanlon: Okay, cool noises. But what does this mean? What are they doing with it? I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a research component of this.\nLauren Lipuma: Science. Well, Shane, do you remember when we interviewed Leigh about collecting whale poop?\nLauren Lipuma: Actually, Joe is a colleague of Leigh, so their project they were working on was looking at how noise in the ocean affects stress hormones in whales. But while they were doing this, they actually found something really surprising about sounds in the ocean.\nJoe Haxel: A project that\u2019s really fun that I\u2019ve just gotten involved in in the last couple of years is looking at how ambient noise conditions vary along the Oregon Coast, which is something we don\u2019t know at all. There\u2019s really no data out there for it. The tie to the ecology is I\u2019m collaborating with a Marine Mammal Ecologist who is looking at how those variations in noise levels could be affecting stress hormone levels in Northeastern Pacific gray whales.\nLauren Lipuma: So how it changes over time?\nLauren Lipuma: What did you guys find when you started listening to the recording.\nJoe Haxel: We found something that was really surprising. We were \u2026 The drifting hydrophone as it was going over some areas that we were expecting to be very quiet because they were not around any kind of vessel activity, we found in just looking at the noise levels that they were really loud. We went and used a tool called a Spectrogram, which is basically breaking down the acoustic time series or the waveform that comes into the sensor. We were able to look at that. We started to see, wow, there\u2019s these really sharp spikes that we have never seen really before and nothing we were expecting.\nLauren Lipuma: No one had ever seen that before.\nJoe Haxel: No one had ever seen them. We sent the recording to them and just, \u201cWell, listen to this.\u201d And they\u2019re, \u201cWell, yeah, that\u2019s snapping shrimp,\u201d most everybody\u2019s saying.\nLauren Lipuma: Tell me a little bit more about snapping shrimp.\nJoe Haxel: They\u2019re incredible. They\u2019re really neat little animals. I didn\u2019t know a whole lot about them before and have dove into it. When they snap their claws, it\u2019s not actually the claws hitting each other that\u2019s making this snap, they\u2019re actually producing a high-velocity jet that creates a cavitation bubble. For an instant, that cavitation bubble shoots out from their claws and then collapses violently and that collapse of the bubble is what makes the snapping sound.\nJoe Haxel: Think of a ship with a propeller going around on the bottom. It\u2019s going faster and it\u2019s making bubbles; that\u2019s part of what we hear when we\u2019re listening to ships and things like that. It\u2019s just a bubble of air. They collapse and that\u2019s what makes a crapping and popping or the hissing sound the shrimp. Within that bubble, that cavitation bubble, there\u2019s a flash of light that happens. They were actually able to record, some researchers that used high speed cameras back in the 2000, 2001. With the high-speed camera technology, they were able to record. They stimulated the shrimp to snap and then got this image of the bubble coming out, collapsing. There was a flash of light that occurred in that bubble. Their estimate is that the temperature in there, due to that flash of light, was something like 5,000 Kelvin.\nLauren Lipuma: Oh my God.\nJoe Haxel: Yeah, ridiculously hot right? And the sound that comes from those is some of the loudest, instantaneous sounds in the ocean.\nLauren Lipuma: How loud are we talking?\nJoe Haxel: It\u2019s like the sound \u2026 potentially like a gunshot.\nLauren Lipuma: From one shrimp?\nJoe Haxel: One shrimp. It\u2019s such a short signal though, it\u2019s on the order of half a millisecond that it\u2019s not long lived, right. It\u2019s a really quick snap. If it was longer duration, it would be a much bigger problem. Plus, a lot of that energy dissipates pretty quickly. It\u2019s a very near field affect. Behavioral Ecologists are looking at it and thinking they use that as a way to stun their prey, but also as a way to ward off other shrimp. I think that reading about them, they\u2019re very territorial. You can\u2019t put two snapping shrimp in a tank together and have them hang out.\nJoe Haxel: They don\u2019t get along very well with each other. But you get hundreds and thousands of these shrimp along a coastal habitat, and it is incredibly loud. Oftentimes, the individual snaps aren\u2019t \u2026 You can\u2019t pick those out, it just sounds like a hiss because there\u2019s so many of them and they\u2019re from far away. When you\u2019re right up close to them, that\u2019s how we knew we were right on them too is that our recordings were so clear and we could hear individual snaps and actually count them.\nLauren Lipuma: When you\u2019re that close to them, what does it all sound like?\nJoe Haxel: It\u2019s like Rice Krispies cereal, but boosted. Yeah, it\u2019s impressive. It\u2019s really pretty neat.\nLauren Lipuma: Do you know about how big they are?\nJoe Haxel: They\u2019re not very big. They\u2019re maybe a couple of inches long, maybe two, two and a half inches long. Pretty small little guy for a big, big sound.\nNanci Bompey: So they found these, or they heard, these snapping shrimp.\nShane Hanlon: Shrimp, shrimp, shrimp, shrimp, shrimp.\nLauren Lipuma: Again. Again with that. Oh, guys.\nLauren Lipuma: Shane\u2019s Rihanna cover.\nNanci Bompey: I do recall that. But aside from that, these snapping shrimp \u2026 But they found something else out that\u2019s pretty cool. I guess it\u2019s related to the whales, right?\nLauren Lipuma: Yeah, they found that the whales are actually using the sound of the snapping shrimp kind of like a dinner bell. It\u2019s like a sound cue that pulls them to places, these rocky reef areas where there\u2019s a lot of food for them to eat. One thing that whales eat are these creatures called mysids, which are small crustaceans. They\u2019re pretty much very similar to shrimp, but they\u2019re not exactly shrimp.\nNanci Bompey: Oh, was that supposed to be funny?\nShane Hanlon: No, it\u2019s not at all.\nJoe Haxel: The whales are acoustically oriented like I mentioned. I think they are feeding around the clock, 24 hours a day, and nighttime, and every time. They\u2019re using some type of cue to be able to find this food. They\u2019re really good at figuring out where food is. The prey is really patchy. It\u2019s not like they go out and there\u2019s just big cloud layers of mysids all over the place. They\u2019re typically found in these little pockety areas, and I think around kelp in particular because it helps them hide in the coastal zone.\nJoe Haxel: They\u2019re finding these guys somehow. That probably isn\u2019t the only way they\u2019re doing it, but the acoustics is definitely a strong sensory mechanism for them. They use sound to do a lot of different things. This kind of pushed us in this way that there\u2019s something to this signal that\u2019s so loud in this area and is associated with a particular habitat where we\u2019re finding the whales a lot.\nLauren Lipuma: So you were totally surprised to see snapping shrimp there. They have never been seen off the Oregon Coast. Is this the first time they\u2019ve been seen this far north?\nJoe Haxel: That was interesting. That is another interesting part of this is that that opens up a whole nother suite of questions. Have they always been here? In which I would doubt because I think somebody \u2026 There aren\u2019t a lot of recordings, obviously, acoustic recordings, but the Navy has been working with snapping shrimp for quite awhile. That\u2019s where a lot of the history of the research was because they were hearing the snap and hiss through their submarines, sonar text for saying there\u2019s something out there that\u2019s messing up everything we\u2019re looking at. The navy put in a significant amount of money to research snapping shrimp. That\u2019s where a lot of literature comes from already.\nJoe Haxel: The next step we need to do was trap some of these guys, figure out what species we\u2019re dealing with. I think that will give us clues as to what we\u2019re seeing. Are they snapping shrimp that have moved north, as a lot of species are being seen to do? The pelagic species and whatnot are being found a lot higher latitudes. Is that part of it or are they a species from the western Pacific that may have come over with rain debris or something? We don\u2019t know so that\u2019s why we gotta catch them. Figure it out, that\u2019s the next step.\nLauren Lipuma: Yeah, gotta catch them.\nJoe Haxel: Yeah. Sound, there\u2019s all kind of stuff that can be looked at with sound once you have the basics and you have the tools, and then you have the understanding of how sound works in the ocean, you can apply it to a ton of different things.\nNanci Bompey: I wonder if they could use the sound of my voice to do science experiments?\nShane Hanlon: What\u2019s the opposite of a dinner bell?\nLauren Lipuma: Your voice just makes everyone run away.\nShane Hanlon: I had to redeem myself from earlier.\nNanci Bompey: That\u2019s a good one. That\u2019s a good one.\nShane Hanlon: All right. Well, that\u2019s all folks, from Third Pod from the Sun.\nNanci Bompey: Thanks so much to Lauren for bringing us this story, and of course, to Joe for sharing his work with us.\nShane Hanlon: This podcast is also produced with help from Josh Speiser, Olivia Ambrogio, Katie Broendel, and Liza Lester. Thanks to Kayla Surrey for producing this episode.\nNanci Bompey: One more note, we\u2019re actually collecting stories about funny field work stories, failures, when things just didn\u2019t go quite as they had planned. If you have a funny story, email us at news@agu.org. Tweet at us, call us. Hunt us down in the street, whatever, and you could find yourself on this podcast.\nShane Hanlon: Thanks all. We\u2019ll see you next time."
