His works are considered contemporary BIJINGA (which means \u201cpictures of beautiful women\u201d) and are made very quickly (see the vid at bottom of the page).\nWith brushes and ink, the typical Japanese tools of calligraphy, Ohgushi creates these delicate watercolour-like illustrations using rolls and sweeps of sumi ink on traditional Japanese paper.\nHis unique and beautiful technique didn\u2019t take long to attract the attention of numerous magazines including Vogue Nippon, Numero Tokyo and Elle Japan. He has appeared in art books and exhibitions, made lots of magazine editorials, covers and advertising illustrations as well as having collaborated with fashion houses such as Emilio Pucci, renowned for its vivid print patterns.\nHe has also in recent years created many advertising images for department stores and fashion brands around the world using original techniques that defy classification under any one genre.\nHow did you start painting with calligraphy brushes and ink?\nWhen I was 21 years old, I returned to my parents\u2019 house after experiencing a setback in painting and discovered a calligraphy set in the closet \u2013 and drew an ink and wash picture of a woman. It felt like the most fun thing I had ever done, and I could feel that it was an intriguingly deep world. So I hoped, albeit only slightly, that even I might be able to get somewhere with it.\nWhat is the attraction of ink for you?\nInk has special characteristics, as it quickly spreads on paper, and so there are special techniques. However, I am more attracted to the fact that it is a medium with a special sense of tension: I have to work quickly and precisely.\nIn your collaboration with Emilio Pucci, you had models wearing Pucci creations posing for you. What is important when working with them?\nI look at the model\u2019s contour and find the line that has the biggest number of subsidiary lines and move my brushes around that main line. The use and the number of brushstrokes become all the more important to make the flow from the contour look beautiful.\nAgain, why do women and flowers fascinate you so much you keep drawing them?\nThat can\u2019t be explained reasonably: It makes me want to pick up my brushes when my heart twinges for an allurement. I\u2019m constantly thinking about how to better express the essence of that twinge of heart.\nWhat was a big influence to you?\nThe first influence I had was illustrator Miyuki Morimoto. When I was 23 years old, I sent her a book of my printed works and she kindly wrote back to me. I met her several times since then and learnt many things from her feminine style. I really have to give her credit for making me the person I am today.\nHowever, right now, I\u2019m more inclined to reflect on myself and immerse in my own sensibilities.\nI\u2019d say that it\u2019s a style that expresses that twinge of heart, as I mentioned earlier. Many of my works focus on a single feature \u2013 like the face or the lips \u2013 but when a beautiful countenance gives me that twinge, everything else, including the surroundings and the details of the hair doesn\u2019t register in my mind. I only draw parts and features, because I want to express that attraction, that moment of the twinge of heart in a more essential way, and I think I can better convey it without dilution that way.\nFinally, what would be a challenge for you?\nI would like to do a large scale exhibition and the publication of a collection of my works.\nNIPPON,ELLE JAPON,NUMERO TOKYO,HARPERS BAZAAR JAPAN,+81,etc.\nshu uemura, HARBIS PLAZA ENT, Kanebo.\nPerfect timing\u2026 Get amongst it!"
