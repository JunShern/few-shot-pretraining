    "text": "- Sari Colt on \u516d\u6708 26, 2013.\nToronto\u2019s historic Campbell House was the site for the SummerWorks Summer Soiree 2013 and Launch Party to raise funds and awareness for the 22nd annual SummerWorks Theatre Performance Festival. Guests had choices of Pitar wines and Mill Street Beer along with hors d\u2019oeuvres like smoked Gouda grilled cheese sandwiches from Lakeview Restaurant and Devils on Horseback (bacon wrapped dates) from Samuel J Moore.\nThe various rooms of the Campbell House housed different theatre companies who performed teasers from their upcoming SummerWorks shows or created one-of-a kind pieces just for the Soir\u00e9e. Magician Joe Culpepper, (Show and Tell Alexander Bell) delighted guests with his carnation magic trick.\nJani Lauzon (A Side of Dreams) showed guests how to make their own dreamcatchers, which allows good dreams to fall through the centre and nightmares to be caught in the web. In the piece \u2018Four Words\u2019, SummerWorks Artist-In-Residence and host of CBC Radio\u2019s Definitely Not the Opera, Sook-Yin Lee (How Can I Forget) along with Adam Litovitz, Max Chandler, Stephanie Southmayd and Alice Lundy, encouraged the crowd to join them in creating a poem using only four words at a time. The witty poems were then sold for $4.00 or auctioned off to the highest bidder, much to the amusement of the crowd.\nOne highlight was the comedic libretto excerpt from Paradises Lost which follows the 200 year journey of the starship Discovery to colonize a new uninhabited planet.\nBluemouth Inc. staged a game of strip poker where participants had to reveal a truthful incident from their lives. And, some clothes did come off!\nAfter the VIP event, the doors were opened to the general public for the Launch Party with more treats, wines, live performances and music."
