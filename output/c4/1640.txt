Located at 1100 Congress Ave, Austin, Texas, this impressive structure sits on a hilltop overlooking downtown. With exemplary stonework and 19th century architecture, an intricate dome, approximately twenty-two acres of beautifully landscaped and park-like grounds, and a rich history, it\u2019s no surprise it landed itself on the National Register of Historic Places and is recognized as a National Historic Landmark. You will be thrilled you made the decision to visit!\nGuided tours are offered to learn more about the \u201cstately\u201d Capitol, but you\u2019re free to pick up a pamphlet and wander alone if that\u2019s more your thing. Checking out the informational signage and monuments on the grounds is another way to gather pieces of historical information you may not have known. You could also do nothing. Simply take in the vastness of the area around you, the beautifully intimidating Capitol before you, and the powerful, breath-taking monuments (specifically the Texas African American History Memorial) of such historical significance that share the grounds with you, and just know that you are in the presence of something great.\nThe grounds are lush green and decorated with beautifully mature trees, all of which part slightly to make way for walking paths that will wind through the complex with plenty to see and learn along the way. You\u2019ll pass visitors strolling alone or with a friend, reading a book on any of the benches scattered throughout, eating a sandwich under a tree, or walking their dog like we were. If you look up you\u2019ll see birds flying overhead, squirrels dancing on the limbs of trees, and Austin city\u2019s taller buildings in a distance, so there\u2019s no forgetting exactly where you are.\nThere\u2019s no right or wrong way to take in this grand experience. Whether you\u2019re a history buff who wants to learn about the state\u2019s history or Texas legislation, an artist who appreciates the intricacies of architecture, or a person who enjoys nature, you\u2019ll never regret visiting\u2026 or forget it!\nDid we mention Richey enjoyed his visit, too?\nRandom photos of downtown Austin streets!"
