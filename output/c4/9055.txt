    "text": "Matt Turck has penned a \u201cState Of The City\u201d post about where the NYC tech ecosystem is right now. I get asked this question all the time and I haven\u2019t been doing a great job of answering it. I will use some of Matt\u2019s work the next time that happens.\nHere\u2019s some of my favorite points from Matt\u2019s post. If you live and work in the NYC tech ecosystem, or care about it, you should go read the whole thing.\nThe New York data and AI community, in particular, keeps getting stronger. Facebook\u2019s AI department is anchored in New York by Yann LeCun, one of the fathers of deep learning. IBM Watson\u2019s global headquarter is in NYC. When Slack decided to ramp up its effort in data, it hired NYC-based Noah Weiss, former VP of Product at Foursquare, to head its Search Learning and Intelligence Group. NYU has a strong Center for Data Science (also started by LeCun). Ron Brachman, the new director of the Technion-Cornell Insititute, is an internationally recognized authority on artificial intelligence. Columbia has a Data Science Institute. NYC has many data startups, prominent data scientists and great communities (such as our very own Data Driven NYC!).\nFinally, one trend I\u2019m personally particularly excited about: the emergence of deep tech startups in New York. By \u201cdeep tech\u201d, I mean startups focusing on solving hard technical problems, either in infrastructure or applications \u2013 the type of companies where virtually every early employee is an engineer (or a data scientist).\nFor a long time, MongoDB was pretty much the lone deep tech startup in NYC. There are many more now. A few of those are in my portfolio at FirstMark: ActionIQ, Cockroach Labs, HyperScience and x.ai. But there\u2019s a lot of others, big and small, including for example: 1010Data (Advance), BetterCloud, Clarifai, Datadog, Dataminr, Dextro, Digital Ocean, Enigma, Geometric Intelligence, Jethro, Placemeter, Security ScoreCard, SiSense, Syncsort or YHat \u2013 and a few others.\nCertainly, the areas that put NYC on the map in the first place continue to be strong. New York is the epicenter of the redefinition of media (Buzzfeed, Vice, Business Insider, Mic, Mashable, Bustle, etc.), and also home to many great companies in adtech (AppNexus, Tapad, Mediamath, Moat, YieldMo, etc.), marketing (Outbrain, Taboola, etc) and commerce (BarkBox, Birchbox, Harry\u2019s, Warby Parker, etc.).\nI like the NYC 3.0 moniker. It\u2019s a very different place to start and invest in tech companies than it was even five years ago. Bigger, deeper, broader, and scaling nicely. Just like the companies themselves."
