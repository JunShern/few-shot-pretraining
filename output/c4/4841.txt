    "text": "Me and Yqt1001 are starting the MOOse front. Black 2x2 flag. Our goal is to eliminate the red front from the map. We propose a truce with the blue front while the red front is being attacked. TheMooCows will offer his services if blue gets attacked by red and yqt1001 might help as well in exchange for this truce. We will start conquering zone 32 and go there from there. This battle may commence on Friday, 20 June. All battles will be 2v2 in MOOse Front.\nI can't on Friday 20 sorry. I can on Saturday or Sunday if you can?\nWhy should all battles be 2v2? The more people, the more fun. I really think you should open the battles to more people... Demanding all battles to be 2v2 really goes against the 'spirit' of the battleground imo.\nI disagree that it would be more fun. With two people you can be coordinated and precise, add more people and it gets more complicated. Take for example the most recent battle where the teams were so confusing that smj and soccer killed each other. We might have some 3v3's with atomic and quontex occasionally, but atomic doesn't want to be in every battle and quontex has scheduling/ping problems. Also I have noticed my ping in particular exponentially increases when more people are on, up to the point where last battle I had 800 ms ping. So both me and yqt agree that 2v2's would be most beneficial. It does not say in any of the rules that we cannot restrict to only 2v2, so either change the rules or accept it.\nSat or Sun works fine I think. I will post in the battle planning when it comes closer to that date.\nI disagree that it would be more fun. With two people you can be coordinated and precise, add more people and it gets more complicated. Take for example the most recent battle where the teams were so confusing that smj and soccer killed each other.\nIt was Soccer's first battle and Smj had pretty much forgotten the objectives etc. too, plus Smj swapped team and Soccer quit the game a bit before the battle started, so this confusion seems understandable to me. I haven't experienced one other battle where people haven't been aware who was on their teams, not the 3v3 ones either, and with a little briefing before the battle begins, this should easily be avoidable, so I don't think that's a very convincing argument.\nWe might have some 3v3's with atomic and quontex occasionally, but atomic doesn't want to be in every battle and quontex has scheduling/ping problems.

Be careful with such rhetoric.\nAll battles will be 2v2 in MOOse Front.\nTechnically Red Front could for the sake of argument with the current rules dictate it to be 1v1, because every team has to accept every member. But 1v1 battles would simply be exponentially more boring than 2v2, so I'll be kind enough to avoid that. Pretty much all other battles we've been trying to get as many people as possible to join and that goes in line with the intention of the BG being a place for everyone and for casuals, so I hadn't really imagined this situation, so maybe changing the rules would be worth considering. Anyway, I can see the ping argument, hopefully those could be lowered by upgrading the server."
