    "text": "Every so often I\u2019d look across the living room and say to myself, \u201cI really should start those\u201d. Twenty years have passed since I last read a Predator book (Concrete Jungle), so I was keen to get into another. But then life or video games or films got in the way. That\u2019s why the Rage War trilogy has been sitting on my book shelf for over a year now.\nNo more! I have cast aside these things to give myself time to sit down and read a good book. Does Predator \u2013 Incursion: The Rage War 1 fulfil the \u2018good\u2019 aspect of how I\u2019m currently spending my evenings once the little one is asleep?\nIncursion zips along at a good pace, with each chapter\u2019s focus on a character allowing me to get my bearings as the story progressed across vast distances. It\u2019s been hundreds of years since the original films (one of which even gets a nice little mention), and faster than light travel is now commonplace as Humans expand their sphere of influence. A lot has changed, but there are still Colonial Marines, and there is still Weyland-Yutani. \u2018The Company\u2019 still have their fingers in lots of pies, but for once they aren\u2019t the ultimate shady evil. No, there\u2019s something much worse coming.\nThe story kept pulling me back in; so much so that I\u2019ve had too many late nights over the week it\u2019s taken me to finish it. I found myself waiting for quiet time so I could dive back, and it never seemed to drag. Sure, things need putting in place, but by the second half of the book various protagonists are set on their paths and everything ramps up.\nA small thing, but the women are written well, in that they aren\u2019t written any differently to the men. They\u2019re just as brave, fierce, uncertain, frail, and scared as anyone else in the book. Perhaps that shouldn\u2019t need mentioning, but it jumped out to me.\nLooking ahead I can see that the other books in the trilogy (I was bought all three together), follow a nice \u2013 if perhaps limiting \u2013 title pattern of Predator, Alien, Alien vs Predator. That I\u2019ve already started Alien \u2013 Invasion might give you an idea on my thoughts of the first book.\nTwo gripes come to mind, neither of which are really deal breakers if I\u2019m honest with you. Different sized books!! I hate it when a set doesn\u2019t match. In this case Book 1 is stumpier than the other two. Ugh. Secondly, whilst I appreciate the way the titles work I wonder if it boxes each book into a corner. If you wanted wall to wall Predator action you might be disappointed. Perhaps once I look back on the trilogy (yes I\u2019ll be reading and reviewing all three), I\u2019ll be able to look back and form a definitive opinion on the titles.\nPredator \u2013 Incursion: The Rage War 1 starts a bit slowly but soon evolves into an exciting yarn. More please."
