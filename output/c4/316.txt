In this test all about condition of esophagus, stomach, and upper intestine or duodenum of patients exposes clearly in the reports. After seeing this report, Our Gastroenterologist give their proper treatment for specific disease and their patients get cure soon, after completing full course of Our Doctors which they have suggested.\nUpper GI endoscopy testing is a unique procedure to identify many different diseases: Such as \u2013 Ulcers, Cancer, Celiac Disease, Blockages, Barrett\u2019s Esophagus, Strictures of Esophagus and Gastritis etc.\nThe Upper G. I. Endoscopy procedure uses an endoscope to examine the interior of a hollow organ or cavity of the body. Unlike many other medical imaging techniques, endoscopes are inserted directly into the organ.There are many types of endoscopes and they are used depending on the site in the body and type of procedure, an endoscopy may be performed either by a Gastroenterologist or a Surgeon. A patient may be fully conscious or anaesthetized during the procedure since doctor uses an endoscope (flexible tube with a camera), to see the lining of upper GI tract. Most often the term Upper G. I. Endoscopy is used to refer to an examination of the Upper Part of the Gastrointestinal Tract, known as an esophagogastroduodenoscopy.\nAfter an upper GI endoscopy, We suggest our patient to stay at the hospital or outpatient center for 1 to 2 hours after go through this procedure till the effect of given sedative ended, We also suggest our patient to rest at home for the whole of the day, to care sore throat for 1 to 2 days and to go back to his normal diet once his swallowing returns to normal. If our any patient facing any type of problem in the above activities, he can come to us and can meet his concerned doctor without any delay with free of cost.\nThe Upper GI Endoscopes is generally assumed as it is a safe procedure. There are no any chance of complications from this procedure, but sometimes it starts bleeding from the area where the doctor took the tissue samples. Sometimes in some cases patients feel abnormal situation when they are given sedative, like breathing and heart problems. These are the some normal conditions faced by the patients after passing through this procedure but these conditions are generally gone away within some days."
