Like a cross between s\u2019mores cookies and s\u2019mores cupcakes!\nBefore the evolution of pinterest it seemed like there was only one thing to do with graham crackers, marshmallows and chocolate \u2013 make s\u2019mores!\nBut now there is like 1,001 things to do with those 3 ingredients and a lot of the recipes now don\u2019t actually call for a fire pit. We\u2019re learning to cook up s\u2019mores in different ways!\nIf you\u2019re looking for an indoor s\u2019more recipe that is easy and fast to make AND can feed a crowd \u2013 scroll down and get that recipe girl!\nI had a little trouble naming this recipe \u2013 they are basically s\u2019mores made in a muffin pan.\nS\u2019more muffin pan cups, s\u2019more muffin tops \u2026. s\u2019more bites would be the most logical name, however we already have a recipe on the site called that!\nThese s\u2019more cups are made in a regular sized muffin pan and it\u2019s all about layering.\nStep 1 \u2013 add graham cracker crumbs in each well, pressing them down firmly into the pan. I like to use a 1/2 cup or something similar to help me compact the crumbs. Bake that first layer for 5 minutes.\nStep 2 \u2013 add mini marshmallows and chocolate chips. Measuring is not crucial! Add as many or as few as you\u2019d like. Then add another layer of graham cracker crumbs on top of the marshmallows and chocolate chips. Use a cup to press the crumbs down firmly. Bake for 4 minutes.\nStep 3 \u2013 add more marshmallows and chocolate chips and turn the oven to broil to toast the marshmallows until golden.\nstep 4 \u2013 allow the s\u2019more cups to cool for 15 minutes before removing them from the pan. I found it easiest to use a small metal offset spatula around the outside of each s\u2019mores cup to loosen any melted on marshmallow. I then used a spoon to remove the cups from the pan.\nOnce you have the s\u2019more cups removed from the muffin pan you could heat them up in the oven on a baking sheet before serving or serve them at room temperature. Warning! They are messy and crumbly but delicious!\nPreheat the oven to 350\u00ba F. Lightly spray a regular sized muffin pan with non-stick cooking spray. In a medium sized mixing bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs, melted butter and sugar. Stir until well mixed and crumbs resemble wet sand. Place 1 & 1/2 to 2 tablespoons of graham cracker crumbs in each muffin well. Press them down firmly into the pan. I like to use a 1/2 cup or something similar to help me compact the crumbs. Bake that first layer for 5 minutes.\nRemove the pan from the oven and add add mini marshmallows and chocolate chips to each muffin well. Measuring is not crucial! Add as many or as few as you\u2019d like. Then add another layer of graham cracker crumbs (1 & 1/2 to 2 tablespoons again) on top of the marshmallows and chocolate chips. Use a cup to press the crumbs down firmly. Bake for 4 minutes.\nRemove the pan from the oven and add more mini marshmallows and chocolate chips. Place them pan back in the oven, turn the oven to broil to toast the marshmallows until golden, 2-3 minutes. Leave the oven door open partially so you can see how toasty the marshmallows are getting.\nRemove the pan from the oven and allow the s\u2019mores cups to cool for 15 minutes before removing them from the pan.
