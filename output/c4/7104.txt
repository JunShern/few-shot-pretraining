    "text": "Why think about your vegetable garden design before planting? Thinking of you and your family\u2019s desires, needs, and goals before planting is the single biggest thing you can do to have a garden that won\u2019t become a burden. I have heard SO many people tell me that they started a garden one time only to give up around July when the weeds and heat became too much.\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be that way \u2013 I promise!\nIn this section of our Vegetable Gardening 101 series, I\u2019m going to give you my tips for designing a garden for easy care \u2013 the same techniques I have used successfully for years \u2013 so that you can have success with your garden. I want you to find the enjoyment that comes from watching what you\u2019ve planted grow and then eating the beautiful, organic produce \u2013 without frustration or losing hope along the way.\nMy limited experience with gardening growing up involved having to go out and weed the little tilled garden patch we had at our house. All my sisters and I could see were a sea of weeds, but we were told there were lettuce seedlings in there somewhere. To say I dreaded this is an understatement!\nand most importantly, I didn\u2019t want to deal with the weeds.\nRoot crops like carrots and parsnips grow so much better and are easier to harvest.\nCrops of lettuce and greens can be started earlier, as well as crops like peas.\nThey make gardening tasks easier- less bending, easier weeding (when needed), planting, and watering.\nThere\u2019s no need to weed the permanent paths between the beds of gravel, wood chips or pavers or even clippings or straw you place yearly. The few weeds that may sprout are easy to pull.\nWhen the beds do need weeding, the soil is loose since it hasn\u2019t been compacted with walking so the weeds just pull up easily.\nIn spring before planting I can weed a 4\u2032 x 12\u2032 raised bed in 10 to 15 minutes with just hand tools and after that only a few weeds appear the entire remainder of the season. It\u2019s easy to just pull them here and there when I\u2019m out harvesting. I NEVER have to spend hours weeding the garden after planting.\nYou can make beds out of untreated wood, cinder blocks, stacked concrete or other stone blocks or even just raised dirt sides (though they are harder to maintain). One other benefit for people who will see the beds from their house is that it\u2019s easy to make them look pretty and they look neat and tidy even at the end of the season with their permanent sides.\nHow much time do you have & how much produce your family needs. My big advice here is to START SMALL. You can always add more later. It took us 3-4 years to fully complete the plan I show above. We started with the 6 long raised beds and added from there.\nWhat do you want included? Just raised beds for vegetables or do you want to include more permanent things like fruiting trees and shrubs or perennial vegetables like asparagus?\nThe direction of the sun. Aligning your beds north-south, for instance, minimizes shadows from rising and setting sun patterns.\nIn addition to your overall garden plan, take time each season to quickly plan your garden crops, rotating them from bed to bed and keeping track of what did well and what you liked (or didn\u2019t).\nRotation of crops is a key pillar of organic gardening, since it lessens the chance of losing plants to soil-bourne diseases and you do not want to spend time, energy, or money growing something again that you forgot didn\u2019t do well for your garden or family\u2019s needs. A simple list of what you planted each year with brief notes is enough.\nThe 6 longer raised beds are my main vegetable beds. They are 4 feet x 12 feet with 10\u2033 sides and I use soaker hoses to water at the roots. It takes about 20 minutes to plan this on paper, copying from the previous year and rotating crops through them each year to lessen disease and group like plants together (i.e., tomatoes in one, broccoli and cabbage in another).\nYou can read more about how I plan my vegetable garden here.\nOur garden also consists of 4 larger beds with edges made from 4\u2033x4\u2033 pieces of wood. These are what I call my \u201cnontraditional raised beds\u201d since I do have to walk on the soil some when planting and harvesting. They are about 9\u2019x20\u2032 and I use these larger beds to grow corn wee-free, potatoes, dry beans, squash and pumpkins.\nTilling actually PRODUCES more weeds!\nWeeds that propagate from the smallest root fragment (think dandelion and bindweed) will come back ten-fold after being cut up.\nDormant weed seeds (that can live for years in the soil!) that need light to germinate will be brought to the surface so they can sprout anew. That\u2019s why there always seem to be more weeds after tilling \u2013 because there are!\nTilling can also damage the tilth of the soil, especially if it\u2019s done too early creating clumps of sod that never break up.\nSO, how what to do with large beds that look like this in spring? I swear, if I thought I had to deal with this, I would run screaming far, far away\u2026to the market to buy produce, ha!\nIn February or March of each year (I\u2019m up north \u2013 adjust for your seasons) cover your larger beds with black plastic, holding it down with rocks, bricks, wood, or whatever you can find. The plastic + the sun\u2019s power will kill all the weeds underneath in the month or two before planting.\nThen it\u2019s simply a matter of removing the plastic and raking up all the debris. There are usually a few perennial weed roots like dandelion that need to be remove, but not many. After that, add a layer of compost, rake it smooth, and plant! That\u2019s it! (You can read more details of my Easy No-Till Planting Method here).\nThese beds have never been tilled and have never had herbicides used on them.\nTo create them in the beginning, place your edging, put large pieces of cardboard over the grass (mowed short) and fill them with about 6\u2033 of manure and soil (a 1-inch layer of manure topped with purchased soil/compost mix). Then plant \u2013 really. I even planted corn the first year in the shallow soil above the cardboard and it grew great, never falling over since the cardboard composted as the season passed.\nUsing these 5 tips to design a vegetable garden for easy care means I absolutely DO NOT spend hours weeding my vegetable beds \u2013 and you don\u2019t have to, either!\nIf I could shout it from the rooftops, I would! Since I can\u2019t (won\u2019t?), I have written lots more about my low-weeding approach (and some tips for flower beds, too) that you can see by pursuing our weeds and weeding category.\nThere will be some planning up front and a small outlay of money for the beds, but you will save hundreds of hours of weeding and eliminate the wasteful watering of paths that occur in the \u201ctraditional\u201d method. PLUS, you\u2019ll be able to grow things on your timetable and not be at the whim of wet or dry spring weather determining when you can till to be able to plant.\nReady to plan your vegetable garden design for easy care?\nWhat would you estimate the cost of the lumber or cement blocks, the compost, and manure, the black plastic, and soaker hoses for these simple raised bed gardens\u2026say, one bed, four feet wide and 12 feet long?\nGosh, that would be pretty hard because there are so many variables. For instance, in our beds we found the lumber at a recycled building place and the first couple inches of filling was free horse manure (too many weed seeds to be on the top, but it made a good base). We also have a place where we can get a load of garden compost for $20, which I know not everyone has. You may be able to find some things to build your beds on Craigslist or someplace. The soakers are about $12 and black plastic is more expensive. You can also build a raised bed without sides to save money, though there will be a bit more weeding on the sides where you can\u2019t plant because they\u2019re sloped. Hope that helps you think it through some!\nI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m confusing myself here. I use black landscape cloth for the garden. Not black plastic. I did try to find red plastic mulch, but no luck. So what do I do now?\nHow deep do I put the cow manure?\nI\u2019m not sure, Noreen. I just put what I have available, usually a couple inches and then scratch it into the surface. Does that sound doable?\nVery doable and about what I figured.\nI am going to do the no till. Lay down the cow manure, scratch it in and plant my plants. And then, I am not going to put anything down and see what happens. No mulch, no hay, no black plastic, not landscape cloth, just cow manure, about 2 inches thick. Maybe a little more.\nBy the way, I don\u2019t use soaker hose. I guess we get enough rain to keep the garden fairly hydrated. Maybe once or twice a summer, I will run my hose over if it\u2019s too dry and let it go. I also have rain barrels that help out a lot from time to time.\nMany thanks for bearing with me on this.\nThat\u2019s great if you don\u2019t need to irrigate, Noreen! I wouldn\u2019t if I didn\u2019t have to, either. \ud83d\ude42 Hope that goes well with you \u2013 just know that if you see a lot of weeds sprouting, you can always lay down grass clippings or hay then \u2013 there\u2019s no time limit, so it\u2019s good to experiment so you only need to do what YOUR garden needs!\nHello, I just have a small patch, probably 20 x 20. I don\u2019t think I can do the raised gardens. Not enough space. But I love the no till idea. I have been tilling every spring and then laying down black plastic. I then plant my tomatoes, zuchini, summer squash and tried hart covairs, but they did not do well. a few pepper plants, but no luck with them either.\nThen I put mulch over the black plastic because I hate the look of black plastic. Okay, that being said, I am now ready to do no till. What is the best type of compost for me to buy? I have tilled in pnly cow manure in the past. I await your answer.\nMany thanks for such a well written and followable article.\nIf I only had a 20\u00d720 space, Noreen, I would still add a couple raised beds, either along the side or two at the front or back. Mainly because that\u2019s the easiest way to grow root crops like carrots and beets, AND because I can start planting lettuce and spinach a lot earlier. It\u2019s up to you and what you want to grow, Noreen. And you can definitely do raised beds that are just mounded soil with the lower paths mulched with straw or something. And that\u2019s how I\u2019d do the no-till in an area like yours.\nYou didn\u2019t mention how you watered under the plastic. Do you use soakers? The tomatoes and peppers should\u2019ve loved the warmth from the plastic \u2013 in fact my peppers right now are planted with a black plastic mulch. And I do often add straw over the top of the plastic, it looks better and keeps the sun off it, so it lasts longer.\nSorry \u2013 on to your question: Cow manure is fine, as is chicken \u2013 both need to be WELL rotted or they will grow weeds. Don\u2019t use horse, as they eat so many seed heads that it\u2019s near impossible to compost it enough at home to kill them all. I actually find it easiest to buy commercially composted barnyard blend compost \u2013 we can get the large amounts we need, it\u2019s not too expensive ($20 for a truck full), and it hardly ever grows weeds like home-composted blends. Hope that answers it!\nThanks for the helping. Can I come back at you? Can I also use landscape cloth rather than black plastic to go over the compost?\nI tried to find barnyard compost, but Newport, RI doesn\u2019t seem to have any within easy reach. What I plan then, is to put the cow manure, which comes in bags from Home Depot on top of the soil and then place the landscape cloth over the top and start planting. Is that the way to go?\nNext year I will do the raised beds.\nThe cow manure from HD is fine, Noreen \u2013 that\u2019s well rotted and shouldn\u2019t produce seeds. I\u2019m sort of confused about the landscape cloth/black plastic question, though. I only use the plastic to kill the weeds, then I lay the compost layer, plant, and use soakers to water only the plants. The only time I use a plastic mulch is for warm-weather-loving plants- tomatoes and peppers. And then it\u2019s red plastic mulch for the tomatoes (proven to increase production 20%). You don\u2019t have to use it at all. If you\u2019re wanting to cover the empty spaces, grass clippings or hay will do great \u2013 you can even lay down newspaper under the hay in paths for extra weed protection. Is that what you were wanting the landscape cloth for?\nYou\u2019re saying that you use the black plastic to kill weeds in the winter months then remove it and toss it.\nI usually just plant tomatoes, summer squash, zuchini and peppers. Can I continue to use it. I can\u2019t find the red plastic mulch.\nI would use the landscape cloth to cover the whole garden. After I put down the cow manure. Is that not a good way to go? Should I just not put any plastic down at all?\nIm getting the gardening grove on in December. Thank you for your wonderful posts.\nYour huge garden of raised beds is amazing! And a great inspiration! Thanks for all the useful information.\nVery good article, very interesting! I\u2019ve been tilling my traditional garden (http://thecountrybasket.com/my-vegetable-garden-how-i-planted-and-the-results-part-1/), but doing things the way you are describing makes a lot of sense. I am planning on trying the plastic, just gotta find it. Home Depot didn\u2019t have it.\nOh, and I think the hose in your garden looks just fine; no need to clean it up, you\u2019ll just have to bring it back out again! \ud83d\ude09 It makes it look like an active garden in full use."
