Thanks to: Steven Guilbeault, co-founder of and spokesperson for \u00c9quiterre; Fran\u00e7ois Tremblay, environmentalist and columnist for Salut Bonjour!; \u00c9milie and Hugues Fournel, two cano\u00eb-kayak Olymptic athletes; Isabelle Lemaire from Jour de la Terre; and Annie de Grandmont from La Gaillarde boutique.\nAnd that\u2019s not all! Six of our very own Cascaders showed up to strut their stuff \u2013 thanks go to Claudette Simoneau, Marie-Jos\u00e9e Arsenault, Marie-Eve Chapdelaine and daughter M\u00e9lodie, Hong Dung Dang Vu, Karine Jobin and Linda Denis. They were chosen for their long-term commitment to the company and dedication to our core values, which made them the perfect models for our new line of \u201cgreen\u201d fashion.\nThe fashion show featured the work of some very talented Quebec designers: Musky, Cr\u00e9ations encore, Myco Anna, Voyou, Marie-Jos\u00e9e Bergeron, Louve, Respecterre, Divine recup, Cul de sac, fibrEthik and O\u00f6m.\nWe hope our Cascades Eco-Friendly Fashion show inspires other large corporations to do the same, and we encourage all consumers to support these forward-thinking fashion designers and labels. Small businesses such as these can thrive only if we support their entrepreneurial efforts, and we are proud to have done our part.\nYou would like to see more pictures of the show? Click here!"
