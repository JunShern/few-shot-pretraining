As a group, they sought \u201cfriendship, artistic society and advancement of the \u2018principles of true womanhood\u2019\u201d. Currently, chapters all over the country are still seeking to keep that same friendship and true sense of womanhood alive!\nThis past Sunday morning, the women of Alpha Chi came together to meet up with some of our amazing alumnae for some coffee and treats at our Annual Alumnae Brunch.

The sisters of Iota Phi are beyond excited for the upcoming semester and everything we have planned for Recruitment 2013! We look forward to seeing all of your beautiful faces and we wish you the best of luck in the upcoming semester!\nThis summer two lucky Alpha Chi sisters were given the opportunity to attend the Undergraduate Interfraternity Institution in Indiana with many other Greeks from around the country. You all read about Christie\u2019s amazing experience earlier this summer. Now it\u2019s time to hear all about our VP of Membership Programming, Suzanne Falconer\u2019s experience!\n\"This summer I was given the opportunity to attend UIFI (Undergraduate Intefraternity Institute) by scholarship thanks to Quinnipiac Greek life! I had no clue what I was getting myself into or what I would be doing all the way out in Indiana but I trusted my sisters and Greek friends that already attended that claimed it was the best. I spent 4 days in a gorgeous Alpha Xi Delta sorority house at Indiana University with about 80 other Greeks from around the United States.\nUIFI is not your average leadership conference. It was very intimate, engaged and active. Rather than sitting in front of a speaker just listening, we had the opportunity to speak, ask questions and start discussions between our peers. We mainly discussed leadership and WHY we are leaders instead of HOW to be a leader. \u201cStart With Why.\u201d Is something I am bringing back to my chapter at Quinnipiac \u2013 rather than how to do a certain event or our ritual, we need to focus more on WHY we do it and what makes it important to us as a person and as a community.\nMy favorite part of UIFI was meeting incredible, strong people that are so similar to myself. I may have been the only Alpha Chi at UIFI but I never felt \u201cleft out\". We proudly wore our letters everyday but they didn\u2019t matter, what mattered was how we represented our letters. We are all leaders but every single person helped each other in different ways. I know from this experience that I have support from friends and fellow Greeks all the way west in Seattle, down to Virginia and even close to school in New Jersey. We stay in touch and are readily available to help each other out as much as we can.\nAfter attending UIFI, I can certainly agree with my fellow sisters and Greek friends that it was definitely one of the best and worthwhile experiences in my life thus far. I urge any Greek member of Quinnipiac University to apply for this when you have the opportunity to do so. You will have the chance to learn valuable leadership skills and lessons to bring back to our Greek community at Q.\"\nWhat\u2019s a better ending to a long day in the office than meeting up with your sisters? This summer many of Alpha Chi sisters have been spending their weekdays interning and working in New York City. Some of our sisters were lucky enough to meet up a couple weeks ago to end their days with dinner and bonding at Midtown 1015. They were even joined by some of our fabulous alumn!\nEarlier this summer, two sisters of Alpha Chi traveled to Bali, Indonesia. Both Brittany Lerner and Teresa Santos joined their QU 301 class, \u2018How Yoga Can Change the World\u2019, for a 10-day yoga retreat. The main objective of the class trip was to experiment detoxing their bodies and testing if everyone ate healthier and practiced yoga would the world be a better place? Brittany shared with us that she first chose to enroll in this class because she had taken yoga in the past and felt a connection to the form of exercise, plus when would she get another chance to visit Bali! In addition to the class\u2019s daily yoga practices, Brittany and Teresa participated in many different activities and adventures including community service at a local school, painting, shopping, visiting temples, and experiencing a water ceremony with a High Priestess. Brittany\u2019s favorite part of the trip was hiking through the rainforest to a waterfall that is considered to be a temple. She shared with us that the hike was very challenging and required everyone to actually get into a river and hike upstream. She said the experience was an amazing bonding activity for her class because it forced everyone to work together in order for everyone to make it to the waterfall. Both Brittany and Teresa said that going to Bali was a trip of a lifetime and they feel so lucky that they were given the opportunity to experience a different culture so different from their own.\nThis summer one of our sisters, Suzanne, is lucky enough to be studying at the University of Tampa in Tampa, FL. Suzanne has shared her experience down in the sunshine state thus far with us!\n\"This summer I am taking a lecture and lab at the University of Tampa. Even though I am so far away from my sisters at Quinnipiac, at UT I was able to feel right at home when I walked in the door of admissions. The first person I ran into was a sister that is in the Gamma Pi chapter of Alpha Chi Omega at University of Tampa. Right away she gave me a huge smile! We started talking about Greek Life at our schools and it seems to be that Greek Life at Quinnipiac is very similar to Greek Life at University of Tampa. It is about 20% of the schools\u2019 population with 7 fraternities and 6 sororities. They even have many familiar letters that we see at QU such as Kappa Alpha Theta, Pi Beta Phi, Delta Tau Delta, Pi Kappa Phi, Sigma Phi Epsilon, Tau Kappa Epsilon, and Zeta Beta Tau. I will be taking my classes for six weeks, July \u2013 August, and hopefully I will have some sisters in my class!\"\nGood luck in your classes Suzanne and we can\u2019t wait to for you to return to QU in the fall!\nThis summer a sister of Iota Phi had an amazing opportunity to travel to Greece with QU 301. We asked Nicolette to share her experience with us below!\nThis summer I traveled to Greece with my QU301 class. We spent two weeks on the islands of Crete, Santorini and Athens and got to fully emerge ourselves in true Greek culture. This trip was my first time in Europe and I couldn\u2019t have asked for a better experience. Everything from the food, beaches, people and everything in between was perfect. We visited a lot of historical places including the Acropolis, Palace of Knossos and the island of Spinalonga, which used to be a leper colony. We got to experience traditional Greek meals and dancing and enjoyed a few days on the beautiful beaches with crystal clear water. We also hiked the Samaria Gorge, which was a difficult but rewarding experience to say the least! The lifestyle in Greece is so laid back and fun loving, unlike anything in fast-paced America. My favorite part of the trip by far was the time that we spent in Santorini. That island is without a doubt my new favorite place in the world. The view, especially at sunset, is so gorgeous it doesn\u2019t seem real. Everything on the island looks like it would be something out of a postcard, that\u2019s how perfect it is. I left Greece with some amazing new friends, a few Greek words, a better tan than I already had, a new outlook on life and the hope to be able to return sometime very soon.\nThis past weekend two of our sisters, Nikki Barrett and Melissa Chighisola met up at the Dave Matthews concert. We love seeing so many of our sisters getting together and bonding over the summer months! We hope you ladies had a great time!\nThis past weekend two Iota Phi\u2019s, Victoria Formica and Lily Keegan, traveled to Hartford for a conference with the Connecticut Education Association- Student program. The new executive boards for all local chapters including Quinnipiac, Eastern, Southern, Central, Western, and University of Connecticut were in attendance in addition to the CEA-SP executive board. Throughout the weekend attendees bonded, learned how to properly run their organizations, and brainstormed events for the upcoming school year. Victoria said \u201cit was a unique experience because we were able to get to know and network with student leaders across the state\u201d. Victoria is the new Vice Chair for the CEA-SP and Lily is the new secretary for the Quinnipiac Future Teachers Club.\nNicole Del Mauro of Iota Phi Becomes an Alpha Chi Resident Consultant!\nThe Iota Phi chapter would love to take the time to congratulate Nicole Del Mauro who will be a Resident Consultant for Alpha Chi Omega at the University of Arizona for the next year!\nWe all love you Nicole and wish you the best of luck as you continue to inspire those around you!\nThis past weekend Alpha Chi Omega went country. Some of our sisters turned in their office attire for cowgirl boots and hats and got together to enjoy some fun and country music at the Florida Georgia Line and Luke Bryan concert in Mansfield, MA.\nWith finals coming up, the sisters of Alpha Chi Omega took time out of their busy schedules to take a study break and bond with fun activities!\nRead all about how our sisters teamed up with the Panhellenic community to celebrate Earth Day by cleaning the Sleeping Giant!\nHow Iota Phi Spent Spring Break!\nHappy International Badge Day! Today, the women of Panhellenic begin National Ritual Celebration Week by proudly wearing their badges.\nOn March 1st, the sisters of Alpha Chi Omega celebrate Hera Day in honor of our patron goddess. On Hera Day, Alpha Chi Omegas give personal service for the happiness and well-being of others.\nAfter a successful recruitment weekend, Iota Phi is proud to present our fabulous new member class! We welcomed 46 amazing girls into the chapter last night at our bid day celebration. We cannot wait to see all the great things each and every one of these girls does for our chapter!\nFrom February 11th through February 15th, Alpha Chi Omega will be recognizing Healthy Relationships Week. As Alpha Chi Omegas, we dedicate ourselves to raising awareness of domestic violence. The goal of this week is to foster the development of healthy relationships and by so doing, prevent domestic violence.\nTo read more, visit https://axoqu.tumblr.com!\nLast night, our sisters gathered to bond over delicious food and Pitch Perfect at our Pinterest Potluck. We has a great time enjoying all the treats our sisters made, while laughing hysterically at Fat Amy\u2019s crazy antics. It was ACAMAZING! We love any chance to spend a night bonding with our sisters over food and laughter. Also, what better way to gear up for recruitment than with a full stomach?!\nOn January 4, 2013 our chapter President Taylor Buatti and our Vice President of Philanthropy Victoria Formica traveled to Indianapolis, Indiana for Alpha Chi Omega\u2019s Leadership Academy. Leadership Academy is a chance for all chapter presidents across the nation, along with one other executive member, to come together and learn how to be effective leaders. The topic for this year\u2019s Leadership Academy was ritual.\nWe are so proud to have women like Taylor and Victoria who can represent the real, strong, women of Iota Phi all over the nation.\nTo read more about Iota Phi, check out our blog at https://axoqu.tumblr.com!\nAbroad & Back: Welcome Back Alexi, Chelsea, and Paige!\nThe ladies of Iota Phi would like to welcome back three of our sisters who were abroad last semester: Alexi, Chelsea, and Paige! Alexi traveled to London, England for a semester. She was also fortunate enough to travel around Europe to other cities like Paris, France. Chelsea boarded a ship and traveled throughout the Atlantic Ocean for Semester at Sea! She was able to go everywhere from Ireland, to Greece, to South Africa, and even to the Amazon! Paige studied in Barcelona, Spain for the semester. She fell in love with Spain throughout her travels and also visited many other cities like Rome, Italy. We are so happy that our sisters were able to travel safely and make so many wonderful memories abroad.\nCheck out our blog at https://axoqu.tumblr.com!\nOn November 28th at 9:15 PM the sisters of Alpha Chi Omega hosted a meet the sisters event in the upper caf\u00e9. Women interested in joining Greek life came to learn why they should \u201caspire to wear the golden lyre\u201d. This event ran for about an hour and consisted of decorating holiday cookies, drinking hot chocolate, and meeting some fabulous women! Thank you to everyone who came to this event, we loved meeting you and are so excited to see you come out for Formal Recruitment!\nKelly Obermeier, one of our Alumni from Alpha Chi Omega at Syracuse, as well as a Law grad student at Quinnipiac, came to our formal chapter a few weeks ago to give a presentation on several topics on criminal laws that she deals with being a defense lawyer. She chose some topics that could really relate to girls our age in college. The topics included laws and consequences for the state of CT for DUI, possession of marijuana, reckless driving (texting and driving and falling asleep while driving), as well as underage drinking. The presentation was about 30 minutes long with 10 minutes of Q and A. This information is really important to know to keep everyone in check with the CT laws and consequences of certain situations. We were so thankful to have Kelly come and educate our sisters about these topics!\nLast Sunday, Iota Phi held our annual Elections! This is always an exciting night at chapter where we have the honor of listening to our sisters give speeches about why they are passionate for running for a certain position on our Executive board. After listening to all of the speeches, members voted for incoming executive officers and non-executive officers of various positions. After the votes have been counted, we are pleased to announce the 2013 E-board!\nA sincere CONGRATULATONS to all of the amazing women who have received positions! We couldn\u2019t be more proud of the dedication you have already demonstrated, and we cannot wait to see what you do for the future of our chapter!\n*To see our 2013 Slate of Officers, and to read this post and more, visit our BLOG!\nTwo weeks ago, the Northeast experienced a storm unlike any that we have experienced before. Hurricane Sandy left behind devastation that will take months, if not years to recover from. Many families, homes, towns, and businesses have been affected by this storm; and we especially can\u2019t forget about our sisters living in areas in New York and New Jersey that will continue to suffer from its effects directly.\nIn the next month, Iota Phi plans to raise money for the victims of Hurricane Sandy, and with that money we plan to come together and make blankets that will keep those who may have lost their homes warm during the upcoming winter months. The \u201cHugs and Kisses for Hurricane Sandy Fundraiser\u201d idea was created by one of our senior sisters, Traci Mann. This fundraiser is still a work in progress, however we are so grateful to have sisters who are constantly seeking the heights, and are willing to go out of their way to find out how our chapter can help.\nStay posted as to how you can help us raise money for this cause!\nVisit our BLOG to read this post and more!\nOn October 27th, women from Iota Phi volunteered to help out with Beecher Road School\u2019s Halloween party in Woodbridge, Connecticut. This was an excellent opportunity for members of our chapter to bond with community members, while playing games with the children, helping them do crafts, serve food, and more! What better way to spread the Halloween spirit than with the young children of a local community?\nWe are so proud to have sisters that are so involved with the community outside of our own at Quinnipiac.\nThank you to all of the women who helped to make this event a success!\nTo read this post and more, visit our BLOG!\nThis month Alpha Chi Omega celebrates two national holidays, Founders Day and Province Day. Both of these holidays are near and dear to our hearts, and when celebrated each year they remind us of how important these days are not only to our chapter, but to Alpha Chi Omega as a national organization. Founders Day is every October 15th, and celebrates the founding of Alpha Chi Omega as a sorority which was originally founded on October 15th, 1885 at DePauw University. Province Day is is a day each year where chapters from neighboring states can join together to celebrate the bond of our sisterhood, form new ones, meet alumnae, and learn about the direction that Alpha Chi Omega is headed with our philanthropy and as a whole. This year, the 6thAnnual Northeast Province Day is being celebrated. It is being hosted on Saturday, November 3rd at Holyoke Community College. We hope to see you there!\nTo read this and more, visit our BLOG!\nTo read this and more, visit Iota Phi's BLOG!\nTwo sophomore members of Iota Phi, Madison Elliott and Gabriella D\u2019Agostino are campus ambassadors for \u201cThe Intern Queen\u201d. Lauren Berger, CEO of InternQueen.com is the founder of \u201cThe Intern Queen\u201d which is an online website that helps college students search and apply for internships, while also helping to educate young people on how to make the most of their experiences before they enter the real world. Maddie and Gabbi both are responsible for writing monthly blogs, promoting the Intern Queen brand among Quinnipiac\u2019s campus, participating in monthly conference calls and more. Although these ladies became ambassadors in two different ways, they both shared a common interest in Lauren Berger\u2019s presentation at Quinnipiac last February, and this is what inspired them to become a part of the team.\nTo continue reading this post and more, visit Iota Phi's BLOG!\nThis fall, one of our sisters Alexi Prenetta is studying abroad in London for the semester. A few weeks ago one of our alumnae Lindsey Diana was going to London for a business trip to work the Markets Media first financial conference and reached out to the chapter to see if we had any sisters studying abroad that would be willing to help out at the event since they were short volunteers. When Lindsey found out that Alexi was studying in London, she contacted her to see if she would be interested in helping out a sister. Alexi was excited at the opportunity to help a fellow Alpha Chi, and assisted Lindsey directing clients on where to go and helping check them in. \u201cI loved meeting Lindsey. We were able to discuss Alpha Chi and learn about each others experiences. She gave me pointers and was really fun to work with\u201d said Alexi. She also said that \u201cThis experience never would have happened had I not joined Alpha Chi\u201d. Alexi said that she had a great time at the event and was able to meet a lot of high profile financial speakers and learned a lot about the event planning business.This story shows that the bond of Alpha Chi goes above and beyond, and that is what makes our sisterhood so special.\nTo read this post and more, visit Iota Phi's BLOG!\nOn Sunday, October 7th Iota Phi held their 15th annual Frisbee Fest on the Quad. Frisbee Fest is Alpha Chi Omega\u2019s main philanthropy event that raises awareness to support the fight against domestic violence. This successful campus-wide event raises thousands of dollars each year and the money is donated locally, to the Domestic Violence Services of Greater New Haven. Frisbee Fest honors an Alpha Chi fallen sister, Elizabeth Pernel, who was killed in a domestic violence dispute. Students, Faculty, Family, Friends, and community members and even Pernel\u2019s family were all in attendance on Sunday, where there were various activities. These activities ranged from raffles, a photo booth, dunk tank, BBQ, the infamous \u201cpie an Alpha Chi\u201d and the main event, the Frisbee Tournament. The members of Quinnipiac\u2019s very own Sigma Phi Epsilon were this year\u2019s winners of the tournament, and were proud to take home the golden frisbee.\nThis year, Alpha Chi had the opportunity to dedicate a piece of the event to Lavern Brown, a Quinnipiac Chartwells worker who was killed by his girlfriend just last week. Attendees were invited to paint their pinky\u2019s purple at a table honoring Brown, and were encouraged to sign a pledge against domestic violence.\nThank you to everyone who helped to make this event such a success!\nIota Phi\u2019s annual Alumnae Brunch was hosted this Saturday, October 6th. Alpha Chi alumni were invited to spend the afternoon at Quinnipiac\u2019s Rocky Top with the current lifetime members where they learned about what the chapter has been up to, and of course, brunch was served. Every year this event brings an exciting opportunity for the alumnae to meet the newest additions of the chapter, and for the newest members to meet alumnae that they have not yet had a chance to meet. Of course, it also is great to catch up with old friends and make new ones!\nThank you to all of our alumnae that came to the brunch on Saturday, and we hope to see you again next year!\nThis September, Arielle Ziering and Rosie Cerri, two Alpha Chi seniors had the chance to go to Washington DC with four other Occupational Therapy (OT) majors. From September 23rd to September 25th the girls got to participate in the American Occupational Therapy Association Capitol Hill Day. They went there to promote their profession and present changes to legislation for OT.\nWhen speaking about her decision to attend, Rosie said \u201cI decided to go because I wanted to learn more about my future profession and get that out of classroom experience that I usually don\u2019t have the chance to experience\u201d. She met two women who have been practicing occupational therapy for 30 years who shared a lot of advice with the girls about life after graduation in the practicing field. Arielle said she was able to learn about members of the state representatives. She also was allowed the opportunity to speak directly to the representatives about occupational therapy, a topic which she says she feels \u201cvery passionate about\u201d.\nOne of the greatest lessons the girls said they learned was how hard it is for legislation to change. But being apart of Alpha Chi Omega, these women are used to making changes every day, because Arielle and Rosie are already real strong women.\nCongratulations to Victoria for being chosen for this great opportunity!\nMuffin Mondays is a new Alpha Chi event that has been implemented this semester. We will be reaching out to the QU faculty to show our thanks and appreciation by delivering baskets of Muffins on Monday mornings to each of the academic schools of Quinnipiac. It is a nice way to say thank you to the faculty for all that they do for us. Many of these faculty members show support for Alpha Chi by attending AXO events, donating to our fundraisers and philanthropies, chaperoning formals or serving as faculty advisors. Without their time and support, our organization would not be what it is. Thank you to our faculty for everything you do for us!\nTo read this post and more, check out our BLOG!\nOn September 17th, we held our first Meet the Sisters event of the semester. We met some amazing girls and got to teach them about the fight against domestic violence and our upcoming fundraising event, Frisbee Fest while decorating frisbees that will be displayed at the event. If you are interested in joining Greek life come to our next event October 22 in the upper cafe!\nThis summer, our VP of Philanthropy Tayor Buatti applied to Oprah\u2019s \u201c100 women, 100 shoes\u201d sweepstakes. We are proud to announce that she was selected as a winner! She won 100 pairs of Crocs that will be donated to our charity, the Domestic Violence Services of Greater New Haven. The e-mail from Oprah Magazine stated \u201cWe at O, The Oprah Magazine, together with Crocs, truly believe your charity is a worthy cause and are thrilled to help you kick-start your charitable project\u201d. We are beyond honored that Taylor won this amazing contest, not only for our chapter but for the victims of domestic violence that we support in New Haven. Congratulations to Taylor for continuing to seek the heights!\nOn Saturday, September 8th, Iota Phi left for a weekend retreat at Camp Jewell. Despite the tornado watch and rainy weather, all of the women made the best of the experience while restricted to indoor activities the day they arrived. Many of our sisters crafted, while others bonded amongst themselves in their cabins. Sunday\u2019s weather made up for the lack of sun the day before, and outdoor activities commenced as the ladies were able to go boating, swing on the rope swing, do the high ropes course, learn archery, and much more. Although the first day\u2019s weather was a letdown, there is no denying that this experience bonded our chapter as a whole and it is safe to say that everyone had a blast!\nOn Wednesday, August 29th, the sisters of Alpha Chi Omega set up their table at the involvement fair with the rest of the Greek Life community. The involvement fair is intended for most incoming freshman and other students looking to get involved on campus. Every student organization that the school has to offer is allowed to set up a table to promote their organization. Alpha Chi had the chance to speak with some amazing incoming freshman and transfer students looking to get involved. We met girls from all over the campus that were really interested in Greek life, and others who had never really thought about it. We look forward to getting to know all these amazing women who signed up on our email list at our upcoming meet the sisters events! If you are interested, our first event is on September 17th from 9:15-11pm in the upper cafe!\nThis summer, twelve members of our chapter left for the experience of a lifetime. Our newly-annual philanthropy trip allows Iota Phi to travel to Barbados to visit a domestic violence shelter there. Our philanthropy, the fight against domestic violence, is near and dear to our hearts and this trip gives us the opportunity to further our connection and passion for such an amazing cause.\nWhile they were there, they were able to spend time with the women and children living at the shelter, help decorate children\u2019s playrooms and even help to paint the shelter! They also met with The Business and Professional Women\u2019s Club that established the shelter, and Charg\u00e9 d\u2019Affaires in order to discuss the role of women in Barbados. This trip is unique to our chapter, and gives our sisters an empowering feeling to be able to help victims of domestic violence internationally.\nAlpha Chi Omega National Convention!\nThis Summer Alpha Chi Omega held it\u2019s 58th bi-annual convention in St. Louis, Missouri from July 13th to the 17th. Two fabulous women, Michelle Moratto and President Lauren Ottulich, from the Iota Phi chapter had the opportunity to attend this year. Hosted in the Hyatt Regency Hotel, Mayor Slay (whose daughter is an Alpha Chi Omega!) declared July 13th \u201cAlpha Chi Omega Day\u201d when welcoming the sisters on opening day. Over 130 collegiate chapters attended the convention along with over 200 alumnae chapters. Michelle and Lauren were privileged enough to meet Judy, Alpha Chi Omega\u2019s eldest sister, who just attended her 25th convention!\nTo read more of this post, visit our BLOG!\nMy name is Sarah Ahmad, I graduated in May of 2009 and I was part of Classy \u201906.\nWhile a member of AXO, I served as VP of Risk Management and VP of CRSB. As an alumni, I did participate as a member of the Lambda Nu Lambda alumni chapter in Connecticut.\nI am currently living in Charlotte, North Carolina and in my second year of law school as a full time student. Most of my family lives in Connecticut, so I am up in the area a few times a year.\nMy biggest take away from AXO is my sisters. My best friends in the world are Alpha Chi\u2019s and I am so lucky to have them a part of my current life, with most of us living in various parts of the country.\nCollege was the most precious time of my life, but AXO made it the best time of my life. Take it from someone in their second year of law school, I have been out of college for almost three years now, and still I would give anything to go back to that time.\nTo read more of our blog, click here!\nTo those of you who I have not had the pleasure of meeting, my name is Jessica Franca, or Jessica Canhao, as I was better known to my pledge class, Classy \u201906. I graduated in the Fall of 2008 with a Bachelor\u2019s in Science and continued at Quinnipiac\u2019s Physical Therapy program.\nI was the Vice President of Intellectual Development and then Historian throughout my time in Iota Phi. The Ladybug family can attest that I was one for the books throughout college and that is partially why I enjoyed my position so much. I loved being able to help fellow sisters having trouble with their classes, whether it involved sitting down with them to think of a study plan or planning out extra study hours so they could allot a certain time to schoolwork. Even though I was very driven, I still made time to participate (more so in the beginning I will admit) in bonding events like socials and fundraising events. I tried to make time for my little and grand little as much as I could before I left. However, I found out soon enough that the time was much too short.\nTo read more about Jessica, visit our blog!\nOn April 29th, about 50 of our sisters attended Milford\u2019s annual Walk a Mile in Her Shoes. Our team got second place in the fundraising category with over $1,000 raised! We were joined by hundreds of men wearing dresses, wigs, and 6-inch high heels. We had a great time promoting awareness for this wonderful cause that is near and dear to our hearts. We look forward to hosting Walk a Mile in Her Shoes here at QU next spring!\nThis Friday, April 13, Alpha Chi Omega initiated 51 new members into our chapter. The grace, leadership, scholasticism, responsibility, and maturity these 51 ladies possess, gives the rest of our chapter so much pride to finally present them as our Alpha Chi Omega sisters! It is with great honor we present to you the new Spring Class. CONGRATUALTIONS!\nWednesday, April 10th, was Big/Little Reveal,one of the most anticipated events of the semester.

The trip is comprised of 10 days in which we stay with a host family and work on projects in the impoverished village of La Ceiba in the areas that the people express need in. This year\u2019s project was to build a new classroom for an elementary school that only had 2 classrooms made of linked fences for walls and a tin roof held up by sticks. We built the classroom from scratch, having to make tools from the limited resources we had around us. Building the classroom included clearing the area, digging the foundation, making the cement, filling the foundation, making the rebar support towers, and laying the cinderblocks to make the walls. At the end of the week we completed three walls and the foundation. For me, the best part of the trip are the relationships I have built with my host family and the children and families of La Ceiba. They have helped me just as much as I have helped them and have taught me invaluable lessons that I look back on every day. My trips to Nicaragua have truly changed my life and I am already counting down the days until I go back.\nTo read this and more, check out our blog!\nMy name is Caroline (Harned) Beers, I graduated Quinnipiac spring of 2007 with a degree in journalism.\nI joined AXO in spring 2004, our class did not have an official \u201cname\u201d \u2013 I think we started naming classes with spring 05 (fab 05). Our class was fairly small compared to the larger new member classes I saw while in AXO, we were about 15 girls strong and called ourselves \u201cforever 04\u201d later on because we were so close and also \u201cALFP\u201d, as a \u201904 class joke.\nAlpha Chi is what made my college experience so memorable. As a new member I met the most wonderful group of women who later on in life became my best friends and bridesmaids. Our class was so close; we had many late nights, long talks and shared countless memories as new members. It sounds corny but as a freshman who did not did not exactly \u201clove\u201d her roommates having a close knit class and welcoming chapter was the perfect way to kick off spring semester.\nTo read more about Caroline, view our BLOG!\nBirmingham Group Health Services hosted The Bowl2Benefit on April 1st. Our new member class raised donations which were given to the foundation and participated at the event by forming bowling teams. Money raised went to assisting domestic violence victims in the Greater New Haven area. \"The benefit was a great bonding experience for the new member class.

My name is Jessie Brown and I graduated from Quinnipiac\u2019s Liberal Arts College in 2010 with a bachelors in English and then again in 2011 with my Masters in Secondary Education. I was a member of the Lucky \u201907 class of Alpha Chi Omega.\nMy experience in Alpha Chi began even before I received a bid. My big ( Ali Quinn) was my orientation leader and from the moment I saw the spirit AXO had brought her life I knew I needed to be part of an organization that not only associated with each other but really came together to stand up for what they believed in. I remember being the first new member in 2007 that raised a hand at chapter ( without asking pretinence WHOOPS!) and announce the AXO Holla Ms. Alpha Chi T-shirt I designed, and from that point forward I only involved myself more in the chapter each year. I held positions such as VP of Education, Asst. VP of Education, Junior & Senior chair of CRSB, Poster Chair, T-Shirt Chair and Song Chair.\nTo read more check out our BLOG!\nClick HERE to read our February newsletter!!\nOn Sunday, February 19th Alpha Chi Omega shared the 1st degree of Initiation with our newest members at Chapter. This is a special ceremony that we hold close to our hearts. Each new member received a carnation and an \u201cAlpha\u201d sister who presented each new member with a framed symphony. Receiving the symphony during the 1st degree of Initiation is special and important so that the new members can learn it as they go through their new member period.

I am a member of Classy '06!!\nI was the VP of Membership Development, President, and then I was formal chair as a senior. I truly enjoyed each position as they were all challenging in their own way.\nMy biggest lesson and best advice is you have a committee for a reason, utilize them, delegate the tasks at hand and assist when needed. In my first few weeks of being VP of MD I hardly picked up a book for schoolwork. I was so hands on instead of learning to be a leader. Learn to trust your sisters, they will get the job done.\nTo learn more about Jillian's AXO experience, read our BLOG!\n\"P.S.
