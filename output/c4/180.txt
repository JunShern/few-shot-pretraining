    "text": "Bloodwise has been announced as the Official Charity of two brand new city-based marathons - the Stirling Scottish Marathon and Birmingham International Marathon \u2013 taking place on 21 May and 15 October 2017, respectively.\nOur running team, which includes faces from the world of TV such as Emmerdale's Tony Audenshaw (pictured), have been associated with the Great Run Series and their portfolio of runs - including the iconic Great North Run \u2013 for 30 years.\nBirmingham is central to our life-saving work, with \u00a320million invested in 32 different blood cancer research projects and clinical drugs trials in the city. Funds raised from the Birmingham Marathon 2017 will be invested in the trials acceleration programme which has its hub in the city, speeding up access to new treatments and drugs for blood cancer patients.\nWe also have a strong presence in Scotland, with over \u00a36million currently invested in blood cancer research projects at Glasgow and Edinburgh Universities.\nMatt Lawley, Head of Sports Events at Bloodwise, says: \u201cWe are really excited to be the official charity of these two brand new events, particularly as much of the work we do in researching better treatments for blood cancer takes place in and around these cities.\nThe partnership will help to raise funds to improve the lives of patients and increase awareness of the disease as the fifth most common cancer and third biggest cause of cancer deaths.\nTony, who plays Bob Hope in TV soap Emmerdale, regularly takes part in marathons and half marathons for Bloodwise. He adds: \u201cThese events are a first for the Great Run series and what better incentive than to run for the series' official charity and help beat blood cancers at the same time as challenging yourself.\"\nTo sign up to run for Bloodwise at the Birmingham Marathon click here.\nTo sign up to run for Bloodwise at the Stirling Scottish Marathon click here."
