    "text": "Detecting iPhone models has always been a bit of a headache for companies working in the online space, mainly due to the fact that device model tokens are missing in the UAs. You won\u2019t find iPhone models in your Google Analytics dashboard which shows a single \u201cApple iPhone\u201d category for all iPhone models.\nHere\u2019s how DeviceAtlas tackles this issue.\nDue to the fact that device detection is mainly done via analysing User-Agent strings, it is possible that device manufacturers disable this possibility simply by not providing enough information in the UA. This is what happened in the case of Apple devices which don\u2019t share device model-specific tokens in the UA. The result is that it is not possible to detect iPhone models using a simple keyword-based method which is often used by home-grown device detection solutions.\nHere is an example User-Agent string used by an iPhone 8.\nThe information contained in the UA says that the device is an iPhone. There\u2019s also information on the OS version and the rendering engine. But there are no tokens containing the exact model name which could be used for detection purposes.\nCurrently, you can view non-Apple devices in Google Analytics, such as \"Xiaomi Redmi Note 4\" or \"Samsung SM-G610F J7 Prime\" as below. However, you'll probably see one device at the top of that list - the \"Apple iPhone\".\nThis technique is used to detect screen resolution, pixel ratio, cookie support, or screen orientation. Here is the full list of client-side properties.\nHowever, the screen aspect ratio in the case of some models is exactly the same, which is why we decided to detect groups of Apple devices with the same screen resolution: iPhone 4/4S, iPhone 5/5S/5C/SE, iPhone 6/6S and iPhone 6 Plus/6S Plus.\nOur Cloud plans provide an easy and affordable way to deploy our award-winning device detection in minutes.\nTo get started with your free trial, simply create an account and download your preferred option.\nCPU performance is another property that could be analysed in order to get more granular results in terms of iPhone models.\nFor example, iPhone 6 is powered by a 1.4GHz CPU while iPhone 6S is powered by a 1.84GHz CPU. We tested this approach using the client-side data and for now decided that its impact on the speed of detection may be too high, while the detection accuracy is also unreliable.\nOur R&D team is currently researching alternative methods of retrieving more detailed information on iPhone models. We will keep you updated on the DeviceAtlas blog.\nThe DeviceAtlas team solved this problem by identifying subtle differences between Apple devices which are distinguishable using the client-side component.\nThe following table shows iPhone and iPad model detection available with the DeviceAtlas client-side method.\nBelow is an example of just some of the further details and device characteristics available for the iPhone 8 Plus."
