    "text": "Spring is in the air! While this week has been surprisingly chilly for April, the weather is starting to get warmer. I\u2019ve been driving around with the windows rolled down, the pup and Starbucks in tow (though I am having trouble giving up my favorite winter coat as you can see). Of course, I need a great playlist for those days when we\u2019re cruising around. Today, I will be sharing some of my current favorite songs. I have compiled ten of the songs that I have been listening to a lot lately, all into one playlist.\nAs far as my music taste goes, the genres I usually stick to are dark indie, dark alternative pop (the creepier the better!), and indie/alternative rock. I have chosen a pretty wide variety for this playlist, and for each song, I have also included a link to another Spotify playlist that contains songs with a similar sound. I hope that this post helps you discover some new artists to listen to!\nNo joke, I\u2019ve been listening to this song for almost half a year straight. I started getting into lo-fi last year and I\u2019m absolutely obsessed with it. There\u2019s something about this song that\u2019s completely intoxicating so I just had to put it first on this list.\nDark alternative pop is my absolute favorite genre! Spotify really had my back on this one when they recommended Skott. She has this unique musical style where she incorporates what sounds like creepy children singing along with her in the chorus, which is unlike anything I\u2019ve ever heard an artst do before. I also recommend her song Amelia, which is even creepier than this one. Skott is probably one of my favorite artists of all time, top five for sure.\nI know we\u2019ve already established this, but I really love creepy music. Whether it\u2019s the whimsical kind of creepy like Skott and Kerli or the eerie, mournful kind of creepy like Marika Hackman and Agnes Obel, creepy music is what stands out to me the most (it probably stems from my love for horror). The only way I know how to describe this song is that it\u2019s basically the Crimson Peak aesthetic in a song. This song is very slow and mournful, so if you\u2019re looking for something upbeat, Marika Hackman won\u2019t be your thing. But if you\u2019re looking for something super dark and eerie, give Marika Hackman a try.\nThis song might not be for everyone because it\u2019s definitely the strangest song on this playlist, but I personally love anything unique and the reason why I love this song so much is because it\u2019s different. I went through a period where I listened to this song nonstop for an entire week. This song is so weird that it\u2019s actually good. It\u2019s bizarre, catchy, and completely addicting. Definitely a favorite on this list!\nI\u2019ll admit it, this song is a completely basic mainstream pop song, and I love every minute of it. While I do like pop music sometimes, I rarely like the \u201cmainstream\u201d sort of pop sound that\u2019s been popular lately. However, I found this song on Spotify and thought it was super catchy. If you\u2019re a fan of pop music, give this one a try!\nIt still blows my mind how young Billie Eilish is. Her voice is so mature and developed that you\u2019d never guess she recorded her breakout hit (Ocean Eyes) when she was only twelve. What I love about Billie is she\u2019s unapologetic, confident, yet somehow intimidating despite her age. This remix has more of a mainstream sound, but if you like your pop darker, give some of Billie\u2019s other songs a try.\nI\u2019m sure most of you have at least heard of Tame Impala, and you\u2019ve probably heard of this song because it\u2019s one of his most popular ones. And for good reason! I have sampled a lot of his stuff but this is the song is the one I keep going back to. If you like psychedelic music, give this a try!\nThis song was a find from a couple of years ago but I\u2019ve recently started listening to it a lot again. Seven Lions are my favorite electronic artists because their music is very unique and otherworldly. Listening to their music is almost like the equivalence of traveling to outer space or watching a sci-fi movie. This is my absolute favorite song by them, plus you can\u2019t go wrong with Kerli.\nThis, in my opinion, is the absolute BEST Alt-j song. It might not get as much recognition as some of their other songs, but this one is definitely a standout. This song is much more folksy than the songs they\u2019re known for (namely Breezeblocks) so I recommend this one if you like indie folk.\nI\u2019ve been following Halsey\u2019s career since she was a starving artist that went by Ashley Frangipane, so it\u2019s still weird for me to see how huge she is now. She truly is a success story. Hopeless, in my opinion, is the most underrated song on the album. I\u2019ve listened to it more times than I can count.\nI hope that this post has helped you find some new music to listen to! What songs are on your spring playlist? Let me know in the comments below; I would love some recommendations!"
