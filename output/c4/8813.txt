Get ready to have an entire genre irrevocably spoiled.\nThe legendary indexer Earl Sprague\u2019s memoir, Invitation to a Subheading, is to be published this month by the Freelancer Union Press. In it, Sprague lyrically recounts the arc of a brilliant career spanning medical textbooks to presidential memoirs. As if that weren\u2019t thrilling enough, there\u2019s a further enticement to pick up a copy. Sprague\u2019s longtime professional rival, Thor Henderson, agreed to index his hated colleague\u2019s memoir, possibly signaling a d\u00e9tente between the two fiercely competitive lions of the industry. How fitting that their notorious feud end via the healing powers of a well-constructed index, which Indexer\u2019s Weekly proudly presents here in full.\nAcknowledgements: family, i.; Index Association of the Americas, ii.; my notable absence from, i.-iv.\nAdultery: in Madame Bovary, 189; of wife, 122.

You want to think big. Like, what if you invented your own language? And made everyone speak it, and be goddamn grateful for the privilege? From truck drivers to hedge fund managers to teachers, road workers. and aspiring thespians?\nToo lofty, you say? Not so. It\u2019s been accomplished by Starbucks.\nI\u2019d get a raised eyebrow and a rephrase for clarity, and I would nod stiffly. You may speak your franchise Startalian, I thought grumpily, but you will not visit it on me.\nLater, in the tempered wisdom of maturity, I\u2019d come to recognize Startalian as a simple variation of McDonalds- or Burger King-speak, an upwardly mobile version of basic food-chain branding. I mean, would I stand at the register in Mickey D\u2019s and order \u201cone of those burgers with two patties?\u201d No, I\u2019d say a Big Mac. In refusing to say \u201cGrande\u201d I was suffering from petty reverse snobbery.\nBut the truth is that when you\u2019re ordering a Grande, and the lights are low, and the d\u00e9cor\u2019s making a gesture at good taste, with furniture in dark veneer and sometimes sage-green or rust-red upholstery with discreet swirly patterns on it, and the chairs are comfortable, you do feel a certain elevation. You may have just pulled a long-haul all-nighter from Sheboygan, but here you are, speaking Startalian and, through your casual mastery of the lingo, acquiring a fine-tasting drug, in a vaguely opium-den setting, that\u2019s also perfectly legal. There may have been a few naysayers back in the \u201990s, a few who dismissed the Starbucks juggernaut by lumping together liberals, lattes, and Volvos, but those days are past. Nowadays, citizens of any stripe will belly up to the barista and feel a little classy.\nStill, there\u2019s a big difference between a Venti\u00ae and a Whopper\u00ae. And I don\u2019t mean the ingredients. In taking fast-food language and d\u00e9cor in the direction of, say, high-fashion clothing emporia along Fifth Avenue or Rodeo Drive, Starbucks makes an overt appeal to our vision of ourselves as refined consumers with a taste for the finer things. And the finer things are European. Or pseudo-European. You may not feel you have the bank balance to shop for couture by some Italian designer with a shingle in Beverly Hills, but damn if you can\u2019t treat yourself to a Grande \u2014 every day, even, for 16 years. It\u2019s a wallet death by a thousand cuts. And it feels pretty good.\nWhen you step into Starbucks, you step into the boudoir of the upper middle class \u2014 or if you\u2019re not there yet, your upper-middle-class future. Doesn\u2019t matter that the beans and dairy arrive in mammoth trucks along the asphalt arteries of the nation: you have a brief illusion of sipping your poison in a surrounding of luxe, or as close as a global-chain coffee purveyor can come. Which makes Starbucks an ideal place to sit with your laptop, if you\u2019re the aspirational type. Starbucks is littered with laptop-typists. Sure, locally owned cafes with non-branded beverages are hipper, but when they\u2019re not available \u2014 er, possibly driven out of business \u2014 Starbucks can serve.\nBecause there\u2019s no inspiration sitting in a Mickey D\u2019s. You\u2019re not going to linger at a table there, beneath the flatness of bright light, surrounded by polymers in primary colors, listening to families squabble at the register over the kids\u2019 sodas or whether they\u2019re allowed to get large fries, and feel you may possibly be typing out a work of ascendant genius. Ditto for Burger King, Carl\u2019s Jr., Wendy\u2019s, etc. Starbucks has some food, that\u2019s true, but the smell of fryer oil is not pervasive, and if there are kids around they\u2019re likely teenagers, snapping pics of their misspelled names on whipped-cream drinks to post on Instagram. They\u2019re too cool to argue and they don\u2019t make much noise.\nPlus, coffee is thought fuel; burgers and fries are couch-potato fuel.\nAll of this means that Starbucks adds up to more than location + coffee; Starbucks is a success model, far more so than the Golden Arches or its meat-marketing mates. Despite its food offerings, the place with the weird mermaid logo remains first and foremost a seller not of nourishment but of predictable, controllable rush. A rush that produces, a restaurant chain that produces \u2014 not only coffee, but you. The green-and-white mermaid is a mythic figure, a styling of pure fantasy: and that\u2019s the genius of Starbucks and its Startalian. Here you can become one with the furnishings and the product; here you also can embody a successful fantasy, a sheaf of straw turned into gold. You too can be \u2014 if only while you linger \u2014 a boutique idea, translated to a mass market."
