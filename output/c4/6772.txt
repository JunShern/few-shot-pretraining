All of my children attended this school and it was a wonderful experience for our entire family. What sets Sawyer school apart from most schools is that the staff truly cares about the children and they are always working in their best interest. To us, Sawyer was not just a school. It was a home away from home for our children. Sawyer was a place where people listened to us, treated us with respect, and worked WITH us to do what was best for the kids. In addition, we could not believe the wide variety of extra curricular activities and after school programs that were offered at no cost to the children! Finally, a school is truly defined by the quality of it's leadership, and the Principal is first-rate. Ms. Robles sets high expectations for students and staff, while being an open and active member of the school community. I would recommend this school to anyone, and I feel blessed that my children had the opportunity to take advantage of everything that Sawyer has to offer.\nJoin a discussion about Sawyer Elementary School and talk to others in the community including students, parents, teachers, and administrators."
