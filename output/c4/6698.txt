Both have been forced to chop spending because of state budget cuts, and both have been forced to move a lot of people around to make up ground\u2014while also trying to keep teachers and others in their areas of expertise and certification.\nA superintendent I talked to from a Pennsylvania district recently called this people-moving process \"checkerboarding.\" If you're working in a district that's gone through something similar, what kinds of job-shuffling have budget cuts wrought?"
