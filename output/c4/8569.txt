    "text": "Mercury is all about the mind\u2026 how we think\u2026 he is also the messenger and therefore relates to how we communicate\u2026 He rules over transportation, technology and innovation\u2026 He is the ruler of the signs Virgo and Gemini and is associated with the 3rd and 6th houses.\nAries is a fire sign, he likes action, he can be heroic or selfish. Aries is ruled by the planet Mars, the most masculine planet of the horoscope.\nWe can have less patience, so some of us may get frustrated when attempting to get our point across to someone less enthusiastic to our cause.\nSpeaking our mind is easier, but care should be taken when the conversation involves a \u201chot topic\u201d.\nSome folks are going to expect instant answers to their queries and questions, or instant solutions, which may not always be possible. Patience is encouraged when dealing with situations requiring solutions or answers.\nInnovative ideas are possible. Under this influence our thoughts are explorative, so it\u2019s a good time to ask questions and learn about things that may be interesting.\nIt\u2019s a great time to share ideas with like-minded folks. And for some it could be a good time to put some ideas into action.\nCommunications, travel and technology may all take on a \u201churried\u201d sensation.\nFor fire sign people, (Aries, Leo and Sagittarius) and those who have fire signs in their charts, are encouraged to be careful while speaking, driving and using dangerous equipment\u2026 less haste, more care is suggested.\nWhile we may all be touched by the Influence of Mercury in Aries, those with the following chart placements will feel the influence more."
