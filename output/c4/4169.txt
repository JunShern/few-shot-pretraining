    "text": "Re : Had the Ultrasound!\nCongrats!! I am so happy for you!! I love Elizabeth - Ellie. I also like Ella. Hannah is nice too. Both biblical names and very nice! Keep us posted on any other names.\nOh, you are all just a riot! I am saving that one for you, Catherine! lol DH and I are going round and round with names. We only agree on two. Elizabeth (Ellie) and Hannah! I am leaning more toward Ellie! Who knows though. Thanks everyone! I will keep you all posted!\nThat is GREAT news! So glad you and baby are doing well!\nHow perfect to have another baby girl! How fun to know already. We did not find out with our first but if we get the chance for a second we would like to find out. i guess either way it is a surprise..just a bit earlier...congrats! i think the suggested name is perfect for your new one.\nGlad everything is looking good!\nDid you know (no pressure [;)]) that Anne Garret was proposing Ilythia (greek goddess of childbirth) for forum girls? Surprisingly enough, so far, no takers...... [8D] we must have been holding it for your little one [:o)].\nThat's so awesome Sherry!! So glad everything looks fantastic[:)] You must be thrilled...Keep us updated....Now it's time to play the name game..DO you have any takers???\nHi All! I had the ultrasound yesterday! Its a GIRL!! We are so excited! She was perfectly healthy. She measures a week ahead of schedule. Weighing in at a whopping 1lb 3oz. +/- 3oz. It was awesome. She had her feet in her mouth, while kicking back and having a hand waving over her little head at us. She moved the WHOLE time! Placenta looks great, and fluid levels are perfect! So far so, so good! Hard to believe I had so much apperhention in the beginning! We are excited now, to say the least!"
