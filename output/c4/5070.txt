    "text": "Yay ~ I made it to Florida today.\nWhile driving down Interstate 75, I had three things on my mind: checking the psi on my front tires, getting gasoline and buying some fresh picked pecans and peaches for which the South is famous.\nAt a Pilot Travel Center just over the state line, I asked a Pilot attendant where I could find the air hose. Not only did he point it out, he walked over and waited for me to pull my RV around, then he checked the tire pressure on both front tires for me. How kind\u2026.and what great service. I thanked him and we wished each other a great day.\nBefore getting back on the highway, I spotted a fruit stand in the corner under some shade trees selling watermelons, peaches and pecans. It\u2019s like the Universe was helping me get in some one-stop shopping.\nI parked and walked over to the stand. One of the 3 men selling produce came over to where I was looking at different kinds of watermelon. I was curious about some that were a very dark solid green color. The gentleman, Charlie, told me that they are the sweetest kind and thumped on the sides with the flat of his hand to let me hear the sound that tells when a watermelon is ripe.\nWhen I picked one up, it seemed to weigh over 10 lbs. A pound of freshly shelled pecans and some ripe peaches completed my purchases. Then the man offered to carry the watermelon to my RV. On the way, he told me he was retired from the Army after 22 years of service and has 4 beautiful sons, one of whom went into the Navy.\nAfter stowing my goods, I thanked him for his service and drove another 50 miles to O\u2019Leno state park for the night. As soon as I got my electric and water hooked up, thunder and lightning commenced. I made it inside just as the storm began.\nThat was 3 hours ago, and it is still raining. One of the sweetest sounds is that of a summer rain on the roof of my little home on wheels with me safely snuggled inside.\nWherever I travel, I am always amazed and appreciative of the kindness and sharing of strangers or rather\u2026.. friends I have now just met.\nThis entry was posted in Uncategorized and tagged HOME ON THE ROAD, tincantravelerPhotos. Bookmark the permalink.\nYou are amazing! Hope your winter adventure in FL is all you wish for. Watch for hurricanes!!\nHey Sandy ~ I am applying for state park volunteer host positions in Wyoming for the summer. Which are closest to where you live?\nWhat a great story. And such helpful people.\nOh, I forgot to tell you. I took a shower with a tiny frog when I was at the South Carolina park. It was sitting on a rail in the shower, enjoying the spray from my shower.\nA very uplifting experience when people help you like that. I find people in general very helpful, especially when I am in the countryside or small towns. In the big cities I am almost afraid of people sometimes\u2026they show no kindness in their eyes and I have some less good experiences behind me. Glad you are dry and fresh inside!\nAlways so nice to hear from you half a world away and yet so close in our mutual experiences.\nWe have stopped in to see Mr. Moses a couple of times. It\u2019s almost like we look forward to it. When we purchased our 1st motor home in Tampa this was our first stop, my grandson pointed me in the direction of those tasty watermelons. Of course I had to have some of those pecans they are the best. We stopped here Labor Day weekend and Mr. Moses remembered us from our first time stopping. He gave me a lesson on how to pick a watermelon, we got peaches, and those wonderful pralines. Just added him to my address book so I can stop again. The hospitality and history is well worth the trip."
