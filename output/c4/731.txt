    "text": "Should We Choose A Separate Spring Mattress?\nThe independent Spring Mattress is an extension of the original spring mattress. It is specially built according to the new requirements of the sleeping mattress. What is \u201cindependent\u201d? The springs are made into an independent and interlocking arrangement. Together, they form a bed net. Its function is to make each independent spring work equally well. It can support the operation independently and can be stretched and contracted. It is called an independent spring mattress.\nAdvantage 1: The inner spring of the independent spring mattress can be independently operated to support the force, and the zero-tone mode is turned on. The whole night will not interfere with the sleeping companion, ensuring comfortable comfort and sleep, which can effectively promote deep sleep and improve sleep quality.\nAdvantage 2: The independent spring mattresses are all made of high-quality spring steel wire winding around the city \"independent barrel shape\". They are sealed in the fiber bag after compression process, which can effectively avoid the noise caused by mold, insects and springs.\nAdvantage 3: Adapted to the human body fit curve flexible and flexible, can protect the ridges, let the spine maintain a natural straight posture, let the body muscles fully relax, relieve the human body pressure, reduce the number of turns in sleep, create a good sleeping environment.\nDisadvantage 1: The independent spring mattress needs to be flipped regularly. In order to ensure the balance of the force of each part of the mattress, the elasticity is good and the durability is durable. This is also its shortcoming. It requires manpower for long-term maintenance and brings unnecessary trouble to life. It is one of the reasons why modern young people are not keen on independent spring mattresses.\nDisadvantage 2: Independent spring mattresses need to be cleaned regularly to avoid moisture and moisture, so as not to damage the mattress. Long-term humidity may affect the life and performance of the spring. This is also a place where the individual pocket springs are insufficient."
