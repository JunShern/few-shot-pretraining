    "text": "I think it\u2019s only fair that I touch on a few things that for grown ups to enjoy too!\nWith it\u2019s unique climate, the region is a foodies paradise, and prides itself on top notch dairy, seafood, and of course wine! There are 215 vineyards in the region, with over 95 cellar doors, ranging from farm style to architecturally elaborate, with many offering on site cafes and restaurants.\nI hadn\u2019t heard of Wills Domain before, but our friends who we were staying with had been recommended this restaurant by a local winemaker friend\u2026set in amongst rolling hills carpeted in bushy vines, flanked on one side by huge gums, and on the other by grass trees, the view alone is worth the 30 minute drive from Prevelly. Add in beautifully executed mod aus food, and ripper red wines, and you\u2019ll be happy to eat, drink and lose yourself in the view for the afternoon.\nWe had been to Vasse 4 or 5 years ago, and in the years since they\u2019ve had a face lift. The cellar door and restaurant pavilion is beautiful, with vines and manicured gardens visible at each turn. We were fortunate to have had a fancy wine tasting organised for us\u2026followed by lunch; D E L I C I O U S!!!! You can also have a cheese & charcuterie board/ploughmans lunch on giant beanbags on the lawn downstairs, perfect if you have small mobile types in tow.\nThe grounds of Voyager are incredible! Rose gardens, perfectly trimmed bushes, row upon row of perfect grapes, immaculate lawns! It is almost worth visiting for the grounds alone\u2026however, the wines are excellent also! And there is so much variety that there is sure to be something to please everyone in your party. We were particularly impressed with their blanc de blancs; bubbly perfection! The restaurant here was on our hit list, but sadly we ran out of time. All the more reason to return!\nAt the very edge of Margaret River town, next door to the famous bakery, is Swings and Roundabouts Taphouse & Kitchen, and offshoot of the vineyard and cellar of the same name. The food here is rustic, with an emphasis on locally sourced and sustainable produce. Serves are super generous, all the better to share! And share we did! Pizzas, imaginative salads, and tapas styled dishes\u2026we practically rolled out of there we were so stuffed!\nIt\u2019s not all about food & wine\u2026Mez played golf the whole way across from Sydney; in Port Lincoln, across the Nullarbor (doing the Nullarbor Links), in Esperance and Denmark, and in Margaret River too, at the Margaret River Golf Club. Naturally after the desert course, he was very impressed with the beautiful grounds at Margs, and amused by the local mob of Roos who had obviously seen it all before and were largely unperturbed by Mez and Benny and their efforts!\n\u201cMargaret river golf course is an absolute must! It\u2019s a private course but welcomes visitors and Jon and the staff are beyond friendly! Ripping bloke! The course is in mint condition, lush fairways blur into greens on some holes. Few bunkers but plenty of water hazards particularly on the front 9. The back 9 is harder to play because it is sloped in many parts which hurts if you error your tee shot, so if you only play 9, go for the front. Heaps of roos, but that ads something to what is already one of the best country courses in the state. Most importantly, it\u2019s easy to get on. We played N.Y.E with 2 days notice.\u201d Thanks Mez!\nMargaret River always looks so beautiful to me \u2013 and the food and wine sound amazing! Must put it higher on my list. (Also, I love that grey top!).\nThanks Cristin! Sigh\u2026if only WA were closer, hey? I\u2019d love to have a few months and do it in its entirety!\nLooks heavenly! Will have to try Wills Domain wine?!"
