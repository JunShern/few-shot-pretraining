During its 3,000-year historycuneiform was used to write around 15 different languages includingSumerian, Akkadian, Babylonian, Assyrian, Elamite, Hittite,Urartian and Old Persian.\nIn his book . (New York: Three Rivers Press, 2001), Herman traces Scotland\u2019s contributions to modern day culture. The author displays his arguments by using scholars as well as historians to show how the Scots have been at the forefront in transforming the west into a dominant power. Herman has sold an extra ordinary number of this writing which is estimated to be in the tune of 350,000 copies the world over. The author is a former professor at Georgetown University where he taught history. He has also taught at the Catholic University and Smithsonian Campus which are located at the Mall.\nIn the history of how have evolved in different human civilizations, more complete writing systems were preceded by , systems of ideographic or early mnemonic symbols. , in which the content of a is encoded so that another reader can reconstruct, with a fair degree of accuracy, the exact utterance written down, is a later development. It is distinguished from proto-writing, which typically avoids encoding grammatical words and affixes, making it more difficult or impossible to reconstruct the exact meaning intended by the writer unless a great deal of context is already known in advance. One of the earliest forms of written expression is .\nThe history of writing traces the development of expressing language by letters or other marks and also the study and description of these developments.\nAs human societies emerged, the development of writing was driven by pragmatic exigencies such as exchanging information, maintaining financial accounts, codifying laws and recording history. Around the 4th millennium BCE, the complexity of trade and administration in outgrew human memory, and writing became a more dependable method of recording and presenting transactions in a permanent form. In both and , writing may have evolved through calendric and a political necessity for recording historical and environmental events. argued that writing has the ability to \"put agreements, laws, commandments on record. It made the growth of states larger than the old city states possible. It made a continuous historical consciousness possible. The command of the priest or king and his seal could go far beyond his sight and voice and could survive his death\".I know that this is really boring advice \u2013 but be very careful about looking at \u201crecent essay questions\u201d. For me, their only real value is to tell you the types of topic you will need to write about and what sort of vocab you need. Very frequently, the task part of the question \u2013 the bit that tells you what you need to do \u2013 is wrongly reported.Those who claim that Irenaeus invented the four Gospels, or that they were first written during his time, have not explained how he could foist such a fiction on other members of the Catholic Church at such a late date, and hope to retain any credibility. It seems much more likely that there is some grain of truth in his claim that they had existed much earlier, and that his true purpose in writing about the Roman Gospels was to assert their claims of superiority over the many apocryphal \u201cgospels\u201d that were proliferating at the time. Some of these apocryphal gospels might have been earlier Roman drafts that had been superseded, and others might have been similar to modern \u201cfan fiction\u201d. However, all of them needed to be stamped out, as the Roman hierarchy had determined that the time had come to bring Christianity into a single large tent. As Irenaeus explained:An is a set of symbols, each of which represents or historically represented a phoneme of the language. In a perfectly alphabet, the phonemes and letters would correspond perfectly in two directions: a writer could predict the spelling of a word given its pronunciation, and a speaker could predict the pronunciation of a word given its spelling.\nThere is no very definite statement as to the material which was in most common use for the purposes of writing at the start of the early writing systems. In all ages it has been customary to engrave on stone or metal, or other durable material, with the view of securing the permanency of the record; and accordingly, in the very commencement of the national history of Israel, it is read of the two tables of the law written in stone, and of a subsequent writing of the law on stone. In the latter case there is this peculiarity, that plaster (, lime or gypsum) was used along with stone, a combination of materials which is illustrated by comparison of the practice of the Egyptian engravers, who, having first carefully smoothed the stone, filled up the faulty places with gypsum or cement, in order to obtain a perfectly uniform surface on which to execute their engravings. Metals, such as stamped , are mentioned as a material of writing; they include lead, brass, and gold. To the engraving of gems there is reference also, such as with seals or signets.\nWriting was invented independently a number of times. The , the , the and the writings are separate in their invention.p85 All these writing systems started with , symbols that stood for things. Then they developed a mixture of methods. Our own system is different. It is based on the sounds of language. All alphabets are modified versions of the first one, which originated with the and the .\nWriting was very important in maintaining the Egyptian empire, and literacy was concentrated among an educated elite of . Only people from certain backgrounds were allowed to train to become scribes, in the service of temple, pharaonic, and military authorities. The hieroglyph system was always difficult to learn, but in later centuries was purposely made even more so, as this preserved the scribes' status.\nMichel de Montaigne.

Instead, he was simply writing down the parallels as he encountered them in the texts, and exploring the implications of his particular interpretation. Nevertheless, his study is certainly detailed, the parallels are certainly extensive, and Atwill paints a compelling historical context.\nThe Sumerians first invented writing as a means of long-distance communication which was necessitated by trade."
