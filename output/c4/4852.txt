    "text": "The Bible never depicts this world as being fair but it does show us a way through the trouble.\nA very Jewish tale is told in Mark 6: 17 \u2013 29. In summary, Herod divorces his first wife to marry Herodias. John the Baptists suggests that this is not a good idea. His advice angers Herodias who decides he needs to die.\nHerod liked John the Baptist. He liked to listen to him even though he didn\u2019t understand him. He didn\u2019t understand him because he refused to follow the heart of the message\u2013to repent. He refused to turn from being his own Lord to the humility and faith which allows what is good and holy to take hold of him. So, when Herodias became angry, in order to keep the peace in his home, Herod had John the Baptist arrested.\nOn the day of Herod Antipas\u2019 birthday, Herodias gets her revenge. It begins when her daughter dances for King Herord and all the guests. Artists have captured this dance on many canvases. This one, from Reni who lived in late 1500s, portrays the daughter as aloof, dancing, holding the hair of John\u2019s head as it is presented to her.\nIt is a picture of a great wrong.\nEvil manipulates the one with the crown, of one who refused to learn the language of humility, or faith, or grace. Take heed.\nThe story suggests evil is born of a grudge and spread by the innocent.\nA simple birthday party, a celebration of life, corrupted.\nOn the one hand, I want to condemn Herod Antipas. Herod\u2013the man who is the center of his own dance. He makes himself an easy target.\nOn the other hand, how many times have we held in higher regard something other than what is right and holy? Even Peter denies Jesus when push comes to shove.\nIt is hard to hold on to what is right and holy.\nI have opportunity to speak to couples now and then. Everyone fights. There should be a book about that for couples similar to the one for mothers and their little children called \u201cEveryone Poops.\u201d Everyone fights. This is true about all our relationships\u2014friends and coworkers alike. What often happens is we feel slighted in some way. The other doesn\u2019t understand us. Lists of wrongs are kept. Anger grows. We\u2019ve tried everything, we say, as the one who we once loved and respected becomes the enemy to our peace.\nThe best general reminder scripture gives about all of our relationships is that our first priority is not the happiness of the other person. Herod tried to make his wife and niece happy and it led to the death of the holy one.\nOur first priority is to do right by God, to hold on to what is right and holy in ourselves and in the other.\nAs Christians, we do this by looking to see Jesus.\nIn this scene from the rock musical Jesus Christ Superstar, Jesus has been brought to Herod Antipas having been arrested for treason.\nIt takes time to find Herod among the dancers, underneath the many bulbs that light up the \u201cH.\u201d But it is not hard to see Jesus there in white lit robe in the foreground. In the midst of all that is wrong, there is Jesus, waiting.\nWhen we look to see Jesus at work in us and in the other person, we will often find him there, kneeling before the Herodian dance, the ego\u2019s masquerade, waiting for us to repent.\nLook for him. Call for him to stand up. Unbind him.\nHe is there in the one who is hurting herself beyond recognition. He is there in the boss whose heavy hand you have felt. He is there in the \u201cother\u201d and he is there in you.\nMartin Luther King Jr. fought for equality, not with a violent revolution, but with a Christian witness calling the enemy to take hold of what was holy and good in them.\nLook for Jesus. You may not ever be offered half of the King\u2019s kingdom but you will see your way through to what is good and holy. That is enough to change your world!"
