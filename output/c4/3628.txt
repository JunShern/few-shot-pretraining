    "text": "I&apos;ve been interested in the film adaptation since my kids and I saw the first trailer, I hadn&apos;t any interest in seeking out the original story but when I saw it in the back room at work I thought I&apos;d grab it and give it a read. The film jumps straight into Lewis having been freshly orphaned and moving to live with his uncle in New Zebedee. Lewis is a young, overweight boy who quickly comes to love his new home. There are very few characters in this book and we don&apos;t really get to know any of the particularly well, they&apos;re all easy to figure out and no one changes or grows personality wise. Infact, when it came down to the final confrontation, I didn&apos;t find myself particularly caring about any of the characters.\nThe plot itself is nothing stunning and I kept finding myself hoping for more to happen, it was only the fact that it was a short book that had me continuing to read till the last page. I liked the basic premise of the book, moving into a new house with a secret that has to be discovered before things go catastrophically wrong. This book was praised when it came out but I find that it hasn&apos;t aged well and I&apos;m expecting a lot more action in its big screen version as there was very little here. I expect Lewis is meant to be a likeable character and there was a good subplot revolving around that yearning to fit in but I didn&apos;t feel sorry for him, despite that being the aim.\nIn the end, the premise intrigued me but the story didn&apos;t entertain me.\nSurviving the Perils of Black Holes, Time Paradoxes and Quantum Uncertainty.\nThis title provides answers to science's most enduring questions from 'Can I break the light-speed barrier like on Star Trek?' and 'Is there life on other planets?' to 'What is empty space made of?'."
