    "text": "Bullet journaling has become a popular way to record and journal life, and I\u2019ve been enjoying looking at journaling ideas on Pinterest. Basically, bullet journaling is a way to organize information. You can keep of a log of accomplishments, to-do lists, thoughts, plans, goals, and more. Customize it to work for you!\nI thought it would be fun to brainstorm and share a collection of bullet journal ideas for kids. Teaching kids to keep records and lists helps them to see their progress and take responsibility for their productivity. Keeping a bullet journal also provides an opportunity to reflect on lessons learned, future goals and dreams, and more.\nI bought this journal at Hobby Lobby in the sketch book aisle. It\u2019s a full-sized sketch book, but I actually bought two smaller sketch books for the middle boys. I found the markers at Hobby Lobby also. They have a fine tip on one end and a medium tip on the other end, and they are just about perfect for this kind of drawing and writing!\nThis is a good place to start \u2013 have kids write down things about themselves. Encourage them to go beyond the basics and think about things they are good at, etc.\nI think it\u2019s good to record the author\u2019s name along with the title to teach awareness of different authors. For younger kids, have them record their favorite part of the book. Older kids can come up with a theme for the book or write a short review about whether or not they would recommend the book to a friend and why.\nYou might want to have kids set some reading goals, such as completing two books a month or reading from a variety of literary genres.\nTrack progress toward a money saving goal with a handy savings chart. Create a key \u2013 for example, each box represents $1 added to savings.\nEncourage kids to set goals regarding skills they want to improve or new things they want to learn. For example, improving their math grade, making the basketball team, learning to play a musical instrument, etc. Model how to break the goal down into measurable steps, such as practicing multiplication facts for 15 minutes each day. Being able to \u201csee\u201d one\u2019s progress is very motivating!\nSome kids balk at trying anything new. (We may or may not have one of those. As a toddler, he even protested things like getting new shoes!) Record new experiences and make them something to celebrate.\nThis one might be my favorite because it\u2019s an easy way to be more intentional about serving others and appreciating the kindness we receive. Have kids keep a journal of kind things that have been done for them and kind things that they do for others.\nIf your kids need to work on being kind just for the sake of being kind and not for the praise they will get, then you might want to try Kristina at Toddler Approved\u2019s system for her 100 Acts of Kindness project. Simply color in a heart for each kind act rather than writing out the specifics.\nKeep a record of places traveled to \u2013 both day trips and excursions as well as vacations. Older kids might want to make a page for each trip.\nHave kids make a page for recording interesting facts learned. Or make it more specific \u2013 a page for animal facts, sports facts, etc.\nRecord fruits/vegetables eaten each day.\nRecord specific progress. For example, make a chart and check off every set of multiplication facts memorized. Make a chart for number of minutes spent exercising each day.\nWrite a bucket list for summer vacation.\nMake a list of places you\u2019d like to travel.\nMake a list of inspiring words to use in essays instead of boring vocabulary.\nIf you want to learn more about the Bullet Journal system, this article has a lot of great information.\nFantastic ideas! I love this and am going to put it into practice in my homeschool! I love getting your posts! Your are ideas are creative but things I can see myself easily implement. Thank you!\nI love the \u201cKindness Journal\u201d idea! It would go great with lessons on character or from Proverbs!\nWhat a great journaling idea! And I can\u2019t believe you were in KC this March (probably like 20 minutes for me \ud83d\ude42 The travel page is my favorite \u2013 wonderful drawings of where you\u2019ve been!\nThank you for the awesome list!\nThese are just great ideas! I believe that this type of activity for children develops creativity in child and teaches him how to express his feelings. When a child starts to engage in creativity, it helps him develop in many areas. And thanks to this, it will be better to absorb new information in the school. Accordingly, he will receive good grades, which is very important for his future. Thank you for such a wonderful article, I think that you helped many parents and their children. I really hope that you will continue to share such a positive, useful and interesting type of content.\nBullet journaling is is very useful thig! I can not imagine a more convenient way to organize the working day."
