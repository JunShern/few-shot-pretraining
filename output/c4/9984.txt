    "text": "Do you want to take pics and videos with your drone?\nI remember, just a few years ago when the majority of professional photographers were skeptical of the newly introduced idea of mixing drones with photography. They thought of it as an amateur approach.\nWell, not anymore! The number of drone enthusiasts has skyrocketed in the past few years. People love them and for a good reason.\nPhotographers can now capture images from ideal altitudes all thanks to these eagle-eyed aircraft. Piloting drones aren\u2019t too difficult either but taking a good shot takes practice.\nIn this all in one guide, I am going to talk about basics first and then share my professional tips and techniques. I will also share some great locations, ideal height, and last but not least my view on the photography business.\nThe first thing you should know is that flying a drone is quite easy. I know the first time flying one can make you say \u201cI am never going to get good at this.\u201d Trust me, every task seems impossible at the first try!\nI would advise you to get some piloting practice before you start taking images or recording videos. Give a few days to learn how to move your drone around.\nLet\u2019s talk about the basic controls of a drone, shall we?\nYou control your drone with a transmitting device which is called a controller. Every controller has two joysticks (left and right) through which you steer your drone.\nThe left joystick is used for controlling altitude and also for moving left and right. The right joystick is used for going forward and backward.\nThere are two ways of keeping an eye on your drone. You can just simply watch it by following it around, but this isn\u2019t ideal, now is it? The ideal way is to see what your drone is seeing through your mobile screen.\nThis is done through software that you can install on your phone. Most drone companies provide their own software for these purposes. Companies like DJI and Parrot have a user-friendly interface, and that\u2019s why I recommend beginners to buy their first drone from them.\nYou should watch some tutorials on how to keep an eye on your drone before you start flying.\nOne thing that may surprise you is how easy it is to take still images. All you have to do is move your device to the ideal position and take the shot. It really is that simple.\nAn amateur mistake that beginners keep on making is flying in bad weather. Many people damage their drones or worse lose them due to this very reason. So make sure you fly in clear weather.\nYou should also watch out for battery life. Always bring your drone back when the battery gets low. However, this shouldn\u2019t be a problem if you\u2019re buying one from a major brand like DJI, Parrot, or Yuneec as all of their drones come with a return-to-home feature.\nBasically, the return-to-home feature automatically brings your drone back to the starting location when the battery gets low.\nThese were the essential basics that you should know.\nMastering the art of capturing shots from the right angle takes a ton of practice. You have to learn important movements to develop your skills in this area.\nMy first tip aims at helping you achieve this very goal.\nOnce you have learned the basic movements, it is time to take it up a notch!\nOne thing to notice here is that there isn\u2019t a recommended size for the path you follow.\nEver wondered why your drone sometimes captures a blurry image, even when it is standing still?\nThis problem occurs due to unbalanced propellers. Every drone has light propellers that assist in lifting it up towards the sky.\nSo even a slight unbalance in weight distribution disturbs the stability of your drone.\nYou most likely wouldn\u2019t notice this problem on your own because it is hard to notice the difference.\nOne sign to look out for is if your drone starts turning slowly.\nFixing the propeller doesn\u2019t require any technical skills. Watch a tutorial or read a guide and you\u2019ll be good to go.\nAlways plan well for a photography session. Take extra equipment including batteries, propellers, and if you can, take an extra motor as well!\nTrust me, these extra components will come in handy.\nFor example, imagine you\u2019re out in the wild to take that perfect shot you\u2019ve always wanted. You check your drone, and it still has 15 minutes of battery left.\nYou stroll around for a while with the melody of the nature soothing your soul.\nEventually, you find an ideal location and set your gear up. You have everything in place, and the photo of your dreams is just one click away.\nYour drone just died because you forgot to charge the damned thing!\nI can feel the pain in my guts just imagining a situation like that. So don\u2019t be that person and always make sure to prepare before you head out.\nThe key to any great venture is to plan ahead.\nOne mistake that amateur photographers keep on making is they only take a single shot.\nIf you\u2019re trying to capture an image, whether it be of a rocky mountain, a blue sea, or a green forest \u2014 make sure you take several shots.\nYou can just delete the bad ones and save the ones you like. There\u2019s no harm in capturing several shots of a single area so take as many as you can.\nWhy should you use primes lenses? Because they\u2019re super efficient when you\u2019re flying against wind pressure.\nPrime lenses have a wide angle and are small in size. This makes for the perfect combination.\nWhen the wind blows and acts to hinder your drone, that\u2019s when these lenses will prevent your camera from shaking.\nInstalling apps for photography can really improve your creativity and productivity.\nMy personal favorite is Google Maps because it\u2019s free and very useful. It is helpful for getting an idea of what the area looks like from above.\nIt\u2019s something you should do before you begin your photography session.\n\u25cf Airmap, some of its features are geo-fencing, location-based flight, and flight logging.\n\u25cf Hover, some features included are flight logs, a no-fly zone map, weather data, and flight readiness indicator.\n\u25cf Kittyhawk, it has some great features like weather forecast, flight conditions, telemetry data, and checklists.\nI\u2019ve taken a lot of trips myself, and without a doubt, they have been worth the trouble. In fact, I\u2019ve had some of my best photography sessions during my trips.\nSo whenever you\u2019re planning one, make sure you take your drone along with you.\nHaiku Stairs aka Stairway to Heaven is situated in Hawaii. It\u2019s definitely a place worth visiting during summer.\nIt is a trial for hiking which is made up of about 4,000 stairs. You can see beautiful trees, flowers, plants, and greenery everywhere.\nHowever, the trial has been closed for more than a decade now. But that doesn\u2019t mean you cannot fly your drone in that area.\nIt is legal to fly around the Haiku Stairs and take images.\nStill, you should get familiar with the surrounding areas as there is a Marine Base (restricted area) very close to the trial.\nShark Bay, a World Heritage Site, is situated in Western Australia. It\u2019s a great place for photography.\nPhotographers who have visited this area describe it as breathtaking.\n\u25cf Kayaking, a natural pool.\n\u25cf Dunes of Francois Peron National Park.\nYou might even get images of some endangered species found here such as Shark Bay Mouse, Shark Bird, Alligator Duck, etc.\nSwiss Alps is an alpine region situated in Switzerland. It is filled with high mountains which makes it a photographers dream come true.\nIf you do take a trip to Switzerland anytime soon, make sure that you also go to see the historic city of Lucerne which is filled with medieval architecture and has a beautiful lake.\nZakynthos is an Island situated in Greece. The island is famous for its unbelievably natural blue caves which can be found all around the area.\nYou can get some great images if you fly over the ocean. However, it\u2019s quite a challenging task to fly near the caves, and that\u2019s why you need to be very careful.\nIt\u2019s actually so difficult that I tell beginners to stay away from the caves.\nAlso, if you happen to be in Greece for any reason, make sure you visit Meteora. It\u2019s a stunning rock formation famous for its beautiful and simple monasteries.\nThe ideal height for taking an image is quite an extensive debate.\nI\u2019ll let you in on a little secret. There isn\u2019t just one! There are many.\nIt really depends upon the place where you\u2019re taking the picture and what your image will focus on.\nFor example, a suitable height for selfies would range from 10-100 meters. While for capturing the view of an ocean your drone should be at least a hundred meters above the ground.\nAgain it really depends upon what you\u2019re trying to capture.\nDrones can make your selfies standout!\nUsing your drone for taking selfies can be both fun and challenging.\n1. Go to an empty place where no one is around for at least a few hundred meters.\n2. Make sure there aren\u2019t any tall obstacles like trees or buildings around you.\n3. Position your drone at a high altitude, 50-100 meters above the ground should do the trick.\n4. Now simply take the shot.\nThis way the focus of the image will be sharply on you.\nI will share three simple steps for starting your drone business.\nStep 1: Get a drone license.\nThis is the first thing you should do. All professional photographers have a drone license, and if you have one, you\u2019ll be able to work on professional projects.\nStep 2: Create your own portfolio.\nSet up your photography portfolio as it\u2019s the fundamental place where potential clients will be able to see your work.\nMake sure you get all the good stuff in your portfolio and leave out the mediocre and average photographs.\nHaving a great portfolio ultimately promotes you as a professional.\nStep 3: Share your work.\nI strongly suggest that all photographers create accounts on all social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, etc.\nSharing your work on these platforms will not only help you get immediate feedback but will also make you more popular.\nTo sum it up, follow the basics, practice, get a license, visit some places, share your work, and most importantly have fun!\nWhat are your suggestions for fellow photographers?"
