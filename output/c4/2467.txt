    "text": "When I first started travelling, I learnt quickly about some of the mistakes I\u2019d made. Let me save you the stress of the unknown and please enjoy learning what you should know as a first time traveller!\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve been told this many times before or you\u2019ve heard the stories of \u201cI took WAY too many clothes!\u201d This is absolutely spot on for 9/10 trips you\u2019ll go on. Be sure to pack clothes you can use with different outfits and you\u2019ll be laughing at the about of space you save. I did this for a 3 week beach holiday and managed to live out of a carry on suitcase! Money= saved.\nI know the organized person in you is telling you this is absolutely wrong\u2026 but hear me out. Booking your accommodation for the first couple of days into your holiday will give you time to look around and find the areas our want to stay. Found a specific area you really like in the city your staying? Well after your initial booking is up, you can move! This tip is also handy to sniff out all the cheap accommodation too!\nEating where the tourist eat is a sure-fire way to pay top price for a meal. Following where the locals eat, however, will guarantee you pay the best price for a great, quality meal. When in Singapore, my family and I first went to where the tourist were eating and paid about $10 eat per meal. When we were told by the locals where to eat, we ended up paying about $1.50 each!\nLip balm is one of those things that save lives daily, but somehow is very easy to forget. Having dry lips can make all the different between sore and uncomfortable and feeling hydrated. Be sure to not forget this one from your packing list and just to be safe, pack a few extra.\nPlanning a whole day can leave you feeling exhausted and drained by the end of a holiday. Not only does it eliminate the possibility of spontaneity, but can also rush you. Planning a couple of things throughout a day/ week will allow you more time to explore the places you\u2019re seeing and also adventure to where people you meet recommend.\nI know it\u2019s tempting, but sleeping when you first arrive (specifically somewhere with a different timezone) can ultimately make it harder for you to adjust throughout your holiday. Trying to go for a walk or go and grab something to eat and getting an early nights rest (local time) can help you adjust to the transition.\nI have often made the mistake of thinking I won\u2019t need to pack extra items such as sunscreen just to wind up being sunburnt & crispy, in desperate need of protection. It\u2019s all too often I\u2019ve found these items at least twice the price of what it would\u2019ve been to buy at home. I\u2019ve definitely learnt my lesson and it\u2019s about time you did too.\nYou can expect whilst on holiday to walk more than usual even if it\u2019s unplanned. Taking comfortable shoes is a must to save your precious feet from blisters and discomfort which will definitely add up over the days.\nBooking a plane ticket before checking your passport\u2019s expiration date is all too common. You must have at least 6 months left on your passport in order to travel\u2026 any less and you won\u2019t be going anywhere besides disappointment street.\nCheck if there are any visa requirements before leaving for your holiday. For example, you won\u2019t be able to enter some countries, such as the US, without some kind of visa. Some visas may take a couple of minutes to come through whereas others may take several months. Be sure to check online before booking your flight.\nA backpack is another one of those special items taken for granted. We all have those item\u2019s we should always take with us (such as a water bottle) they may be too awkward to carry alone with multiple other things. Having a backpack will not only allow you to take more with you, but will also keep your belongings safe and secure.\nItems such as a pillow, blanket and comfortable clothes are must-haves to ensure a great flight. Cold air-conditioning or a sore back may seem insignificant but can make or break a flight.\nTravelling alone can tend to get lonely after some time. Being selective about the places you travel alone can save you a huge headache of taking your luggage with you into bathrooms other small spaces. Do yourself a favour, make a friend and share the responsibility of luggage watching.\nMoney exchange services at airports are renowned for having high fees so exchange your money before leaving home and give yourself some time to search around for the best exchange rate.\nIt has been said that the tropics are unlike much of the world; bugs and all. Keeping your luggage, food or any other goods closed when not being used may save you from dealing with a few extra creepy crawly friends.\nWearing a winter coat may seem like a good idea when traveling somewhere cold\u2026 but that good idea will soon turn south when you realize your long layover is in a hot country. Wear clothes appropriate for your layover and pack a backpack with clothes to change into.\nThe amount of stories I\u2019ve heard about people being sick on vacation is crazy. Pack a little baggie full of pain killers, gastro stop, hydra light, cold&flu meds, disinfectant wipes, bandaids etc. You\u2019ll be doing yourself and those around you a great service!\nSome countries are much different from the one you might be used to. For example, toilet paper does not come standard in China and women are required to cover their shoulders and knees in Papua New Guinea. Be aware of these standards before going somewhere new.\nIf your gut is telling you \u201cdon\u2019t go there alone\u201d or \u201cthat person seems a bit shady\u201d, then LISTEN! I have heard too many stories of near misses with women being alone in unfamiliar countries because they didn\u2019t listen to that nudging at the back of their mind. Your gut instinct will keep you safe and ignoring it could be risky.\nThank you for reading my tips for first time travellers! I hope you\u2019ve found some of these points helpful, even if you\u2019re an experienced traveller. Let me know if you\u2019ve made any of these mistake in the comments and what you think about adding GIF\u2019s to my posts. Be sure to follow my Instagram and blog as well as liking my Facebook.\nUntil next time, stay wild.\nI wish I had read this before traveling abroad in my youth. I think I made all of the mistakes the first time.\nTaking comfortable shoes with you when you travel is very practical tip as the would be traveler would on the move all the time. Uncomfortable shoes would e a problem in this context. I also liked how you addressed the issue of packing clothes that can be mixed and matched or the packing can be too bulky.\nSuch a great list! For years I have been guilty of #1. I pack waaaay too many clothes. Finally, I had to reason with myself, on a regular basis I don\u2019t wear half my clothes so why pack 23 shirts and 11 pairs of pants (most of them haven\u2019t seen the light of day in months, but I pack them for the what-if\u2019s) for a weekend trip.. haha thanks for sharing girl!\nThe first one is so me lol! I pack a lot of clothes just in case. Great points! Thanks for sharing \u2665\ufe0f \u2665\ufe0f By any chance you are interested on doing collaborations, you can check out the collaborations portal of Phlanx.com and connect with amazing brands!\nThanks for reading \ud83d\udc95 I\u2019m definitely interested and will check it out.\nThis is so true. The lip balm is one I still keep forgetting.\nI never forget to take lip balm with me, because I literally cannot survive without it anywhere including home. We learned not to eat in \u201ctraditional restaurants\u201d (restaurants where they supposedly serve traditional food for tourists) in Belgrade when we had few very bed dinners. Since then we always go for places where locals eat and where there is a lot of people. Great list!"
