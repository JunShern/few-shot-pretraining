Yet, with so many islands to choose from picking one to visit is the hardest part!\nOkay, we know picking which luxury island to visit is hardly going to be a tough affair. After, all the Caribbean is home to blissful temperatures, stunning scenery, a delicious foodie scene and a culture which will probably mean you never want to come home. But, the islands do vary, and you want to ensure that the one you pick is the perfect choice for the type of holiday you plan on embarking on.\nAre you looking for an adventure holiday?

From bustling Nassau, which is often filled with cruise ships and the largest number of visitors to the Bahamas, to the Out Islands (the islands which are outside of Nassau) where you\u2019ll find secluded beaches and a more peaceful escape.\nWhy go? For a picture perfect holiday. The beaches are powder-soft and made up of limestone-white sands with shallow shorelines making it a picturesque destination. The Bahamas also benefits from around 340 days of sunshine per year on average, with the driest months between December and April. Visit in June to see the world-famous Junkanoo festival \u2013 it\u2019s something not to miss.\nWhen you say Caribbean one of the first islands to come into your mind is of course Jamaica. A destination which appeals to a variety of travelers \u2013 be it those who want to experience the home of reggae or those looking to take advantage of the golf courses on Montego Bay.\nWhy go? Bird watching. Yes really. Jamaica is home to an incredible variety of birds, including 29 world endemic species. Hiking up the mountains is also popular among travellers, and you can stop off at a number of coffee plantations en route.\nColourful villages, sun-drenched beaches, and a glittering sailing scene (it\u2019s home to the Caribbean\u2019s major regatta and mega yachts), Antigua and Barbuda is perfect for those looking for a luxury holiday escape.\nWhy go? Barbuda is less developed than Antigua, but is home to beaches which rival its sister Antigua. However, Antigua is still home to some of the best beaches in the Caribbean \u2013 the beaches south-west of Jolly Bay are stunning. In fact, you could visit a different beach every day of the year!\nIf you\u2019re looking for an island that you could get round in just a few days, then Anguilla is the perfect choice. Famous for its white sandy beaches (it has just 33 to choose from), and it\u2019s laidback and relaxing atmosphere there\u2019s no better place to unwind.\nWhy go? Street food! The Valley in Anguilla is home to some of the islands most famous food vans which offer everything from pizza, pasta, lobster and ribs \u2013 delicious.\nSt Kitts and Nevis is a two-island nation and is home to a jungle terrain, and beaches with a mountainous backdrop.

Plus, the St Kitts Scenic Railway allows passengers to travel along an 18-mile gauge line which previously transported cane.\nNow, I know you\u2019re now thinking about how incredible these destinations sound. So much so that you\u2019re wondering how you can make the Caribbean your home. Well you can, through a Citizenship by Investment programme. However, Caribbean countries have recently tightened their regulations \u2013 yet, this simply shows the dedication to excellence that these countries are achieving."
