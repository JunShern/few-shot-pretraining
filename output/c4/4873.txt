    "text": "Father Roderick\u2019s \u201cSuperheroes Checklist\u201d is insightful and a great deal of fun for those with geekish tendencies (like myself) who enjoy superhero stories, but it also makes discernment very accessible to anyone who has seen even one superhero film. Included in his checklist are: seek solitude, study and read, discover your strengths and acknowledge your weaknesses, be humble, listen to your friends, do not fear, and persevere.\nBelow is my less-fun, not super-hero related list of essentials to put in place in your life as you begin or continue to discern your vocation. (Notice that my list intersects with Geekpriest\u2019s SuperHeroes Checklist in more than one place!) This list also sums up a whole slew of my previous blog posts.\n1. A dynamic prayer life and sacramental life. Have a real relationship with God that is living and growing. This means a regular prayer life, not just a \u201chit or miss\u201d approach, or only praying \u201cwhen I feel like it.\u201d If you haven\u2019t already, commit to daily prayer.\nBecoming an \u201cexpert\u201d in prayer is a lifelong journey, but having a genuine relationship with God when we are seeking his will is essential. How better to learn how to recognize God\u2019s invitation in the big decisions we have to make, than to listen to God every day?\nThe sacraments are the privileged ways that the Church offers us an encounter with Christ. Frequently participating in Holy Mass (Sunday Mass is the minimum) and regular reception of the Sacrament of Reconciliation are the ordinary means for growing in our relationship with God. They might seem \u201cordinary,\u201d but both sacraments are really hidden miracles in our midst.\nAt Mass, we adore, thank, offer ourselves with, and receive Jesus himself, who delights in sharing himself with us and inviting us into his own relationship with the Father. In the Sacrament of Reconciliation, all of the obstacles that we put between God and ourselves\u2014our sins, woundedness, and flaws\u2014are forgiven and healed in a sacred encounter with Jesus\u2019 merciful love.\n2. Strive to live a good moral life. All of us are called to holiness, to grow in union with God here on earth, a union that will be fulfilled in perfect communion with God in heaven. Every vocation is a call to profound holiness. Constantly living in a state of serious sin means we are putting obstacles between us and God. All sin is a roadblock for our discernment, because sin is turning away from God\u2019s will and choosing our will over God\u2019s. Instead, discernment is striving to know and live God\u2019s will. We do not need to be sinless to discern because we are all sinners, but we want to be striving to be upright, sincere about our journey of growing in virtue.\nGod has a plan for us that will bring about our greatest happiness and in which we will help others in a way that no one else will.\n4. Get to know ourselves. This includes not just getting to know our gifts and weaknesses, but also discovering our motivations, which helps us to know what is most important to us. Including a daily examination of conscience in our prayer helps us to discover any area in our life\u2014an attachment to a particular sin, for example\u2014that might prevent us from seeking God\u2019s will. Why are we entering into this discernment? What is in our hearts, what are we seeking? How can we more singleheartedly seek God\u2019s will?\n5. Active engagement with the Church. Our vocational state in life determines our role in the Church, as well as in life. Discernment doesn\u2019t just involve God and us; it also involves the Church, the People of God within whom we will live and serve. In order to discern our role in the Church, we must already know the Church from the inside by being actively engaged with our parish or a church group. If we have not been involved with our parish, or other form of ministry, now is the time to get involved!\nEspecially for those discerning religious life or priesthood, or between one of these and marriage, it is essential to take part in the ministry and missionary life of the Church; otherwise we will not have the experience of sharing our gifts in ministry and the Church\u2019s mission. Without this experience it\u2019s hard to know what it would be like to share our gifts in this way as a lay person, sister, brother, or priest. We don\u2019t always have to do this through our parish\u2014there are other church groups that we can become involved in\u2014but we need to find some way to get really involved in the Church\u2019s ministry and mission.\n6. Regular spiritual direction. [For more about spiritual direction\u2014what it is, how to find a director, and what to expect for the first time, visit here and here.] A spiritual director may not be necessary as we begin discerning our vocation, but once we start to get serious, we should definitely start seeing a spiritual director regularly.\nThe first five areas are so important for discerning that they are, in a way, \u201cprerequisites\u201d to seriously discerning one\u2019s vocation. If any of these are lacking, it might be a good idea to make that our \u201cnext step\u201d in discerning our vocation."
