    "text": "Digg, the RSS reader of Betaworks, has announced the launch of its Android application. Of course, it allows you to enjoy the \"Top Stories\u201d articles handpicked, as well as the aggregator. However, some important features still missing as display only unread content and synchronization in the background. Following the announcement of the closure of Google Reader, Digg decided to embark on the adventure of RSS aggregators. Indeed, the company was proposing a community site or the users voted for they considered relevant or the useful content. The most interesting and or popular were then highlighted. Digg request user feedback but do not necessarily take into account. But before diving Digg organized several surveys to collect the opinions of Internet users, the goal was to offer a product that meets their expectations. But in practice, there is sometimes a gap: while the direct sharing by email and research streams were in high demand, they are not yet available in Digg Reader as currently proposed.\nHowever, the company does not remain inactive and just put online a first version of its highly anticipated Android app too, obviously. Anyway, after two months of waiting, it is now available, but it sorely lacks some basic features. It is obviously possible to navigate through the \u201cTop Stories\u201d and in your various RSS feeds, save (via Pocket, Instapaper and Readability) and share via social networks. In addition, you can sort, add and delete files and streams. By cons, this first version do not displays your unread content, which is unfortunate. Note that when the closure of Google Reader in early July, the site was in the same situation, but this feature is quickly arriving later, hope it will be the same here. It is not possible to change the screen orientation (portrait by default), the font size and activate the update stream in the background. This should, however, make an appearance before the announcement of the Premium model, long planned."
