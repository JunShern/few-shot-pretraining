    "text": "Learning how to pack for a week away may be the one of the biggest adjustments for those new to the travel scene. One thing you\u2019ll learn very quickly is that checking bags is never high on the list. You lose way too much time dropping off and picking up. Besides, who can afford the risk of lost luggage and having nothing to wear to your client? This means you must carry on and learn how to get four days' worth of stuff into one suitcase that fits easily in the overhead bin. You\u2019ll also probably want to work out and do some things in the evenings, which means you\u2019ll want more than just work clothes. So, how in the world do you find room to pack it all? After a few weeks you\u2019ll have it down to a science and can get more creative. In the meantime, here\u2019s my personal rule for your basic needs: Remember 4-3-2-1.\n\u2022 4 \u2013 Two things that are critical to maintain are good hygiene and your professional image. That means you are going to need to have a different outfit for each day. For a typical Mon-Thurs schedule, you\u2019ll need (4) shirts or tops as well as (4) sets of undergarments and socks (that includes undershirts for the guys).\n\u2022 3 \u2013 Sorry ladies, I love my shoes just as much as the next girl, but when you are traveling each week, you simply can\u2019t drag your entire closet with you. That\u2019s why (3) is the maximum number of pairs of shoes to bring: (1) Dress, (1) Workout and (1) Casual. For dress shoes try to stick to black or brown when traveling. It simply makes life easier. You can wear black with nearly any color pant but it\u2019s much harder to pair your favorite yellow pumps, for example, with multiple pants. If you want to stick to your workout schedule, you\u2019ll need sneakers. These are the only pair of bulky shoes that go inside the bag. Finally, when you want to run to the store after work or are headed home Thursday night, more comfortable shoes are really what you want. That\u2019s why you might also pack a pair of flats or flip flops that can slide easily into the front pocket of the suitcase. If you opt for flats they can also double as an additional pair for work if you want a second color or something a bit more fun (bonus).\n\u2022 2 -While we want to keep you looking sharp and fresh, you should always look for places to stretch where you can. Doing so means more space in your bag. You can typically get away with (2) bottom pieces per week. For example, you might pack a black and tan pair of pants for the week and wear your black pants Monday/Wednesday and tan pants on Tuesday/Thursday. That leaves additional space in your bag for (2) workout shirts and socks so you make sure to get in some gym time.\n\u2022 1 \u2013 Temperature is always dicey, so you\u2019ll want at least (1) over garment like a sweater or jacket that you\u2019ll wear or carry. Select something neutral in color and goes with anything. If you are going to hit the gym you\u2019ll also need (1) set of workout bottoms as you can probably get a couple uses out of those. For the final item, you\u2019ll need to include (1) toiletry bag with your travel size personal items.\nFollowing this easy formula will make sure you can pack everything you need into one bag and give you a great checklist so you don\u2019t forget anything, like I\u2019m often prone to do!"
