    "text": "Newcastle is the unsung hero of Australia, under the radar and lesser-known to visitors from overseas but a true gem to those who are in the know. An Australian harbour city in New South Wales, surrounded by eight beaches, each beach is joined by the Bather's Way; a popular coastal walk which stretches from Merewether Beach to Nobbys Beach. The path passes Bogey Hole along the way; a colonial ocean bath built by convicts, and Fort Scratchley, which is ideal for whale-spotting. The city is only a tenth of the size of Sydney, but it is rapidly becoming a hot tourist destination. The restaurants in Newcastle are just excellent; international in cuisine, affordable in price and with a strong focus on the diner experience.\nThe city is the seventh largest in Australia and it hosts a whole range of world-class festivals and events, so there is a huge amount for both locals and visitors to look forward to throughout the course of the year. You'll find an intriguing variety and selection of restaurants in Newcastle, with new dining hotspots opening up all the time in the city, suburbs and beach fronts. In fact, the so-called \u2018Steel City\u2019 is in the midst of an intensive reinvention phase, moving beyond its steel and coal mining industries. The optimism and enthusiasm of the modern, ever-evolving city is reflected in Newcastle's restaurants, which offer exciting food, attentive service and striking interiors as part of their dining experience.\nBut, where to begin your Newcastle restaurants tour?\nTwo popular hotspots for Newcastle restaurants are Beaumont Street in Hamilton and Darby Street in Cooks Hill, but you'll find exciting new venues in the city's old industrial heartland too. Remember to check out hidden streets and look for reviews of the restaurants in Newcastle on Quandoo to help you choose. Uber Thai in the suburb of Hamilton is great if you're looking to expand your knowledge of Thai dishes. It serves all the popular choices, such as pad thai, but also has more unusual dishes on the menu such as pork neck skewers and warm glutinous rice balls with sweet lychee sauce.\nPerhaps you're looking for a more Mediterranean experience at one of Newcastle's restaurants? Then check out Rustica on King Street in Newcastle East. It offers a broad Mediterranean menu that offers everything from Spanish taps through to Turkish mezze. Be sure to check out the Cypriot fried halloumi for a taste of heaven! On the other hand, perhaps you want to taste New Australian food at its finest? If so, head to The Depot on Darby, on Darby Street in the CBD. Quandoo diners rate it highly, and it is one of the best restaurants in Newcastle for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Try eggs Benedict on sourdough or acai bowls to start your day right, or book a table in the evening for a hefty beef burger with home-made fries and slaw.\nWhat should you wear to Newcastle's restaurants?\nMost of the restaurants in Newcastle have a distinctly relaxed and laid-back feel, with casual dress typical and no need to stand on ceremony. However, when you want to dress up for the occasion and experience some fine dining, you'll find plenty of places which welcome smart dress and which attract a glamorous crowd. As with most things Australian, formality is minimal and you'll see a real variation in diners and their presentation. If in doubt, just opt for something smart but comfortable!\nThere\u2019s something for everyone at Newcastle restaurants from friendly, budget cafes serving hearty servings of vegetarian moussaka through to Japanese sushi bars preparing fresh dishes in front of guests, and plenty of variety to keep your taste buds tantalised. Because the city has such a packed events calendar, it can get particularly busy at certain times of the year. Key events include the city's annual music festival and winter fair, the International Animation Festival, City SuperMoto, Spring Racing event and various food and drink festivals. Newcastle's restaurants are also particularly busy in the evenings and weekends, so it's always wise to book in advance with Quandoo. Remember, you can reserve a table online with us up to two hours before you dine. After all, who wants to queue when they can simply sweep past the queues and get seated straight away at some of the best restaurants in up-and-coming Newcastle?"
