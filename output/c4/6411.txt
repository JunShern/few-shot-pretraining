    "text": "Please read and then sign the petition form below and forward this linked petition to everyone you know, particularly other sustainability or global warming (aka climate change,) organizations.\nWith one click you can both sign the petition and, if you use the share button, it will be electronically sent to your friends as well as people in power who are responsible for addressing the global warming emergency. If any of your friends need to be informed about why this emergency meeting needs to be called, you can refer them to the global warming educational materials on the Job One For Humanity website.\nBased upon a preponderance of scientific evidence, we recognize our global climate is rapidly warming and becoming increasingly unstable due to human-caused carbon pollution from the burning of fossil fuels. If we do not change course before global warming tipping points are crossed, this destabilization of our climate will continue to cause ever-increasing suffering and potentially irreversible devastation for both current and future generations. If left unresolved, it could cause the extinction, or near extinction, of the human species.\nWe further recognize that rapidly escalating global warming emergency and its consequent climate destabilization is the greatest current active threat to the security of all nations, comparable in the scope of impact to global nuclear war. Escalating average global temperature rises will lead to destabilization affecting first millions, then billions of people forced to deal with ongoing climate catastrophes, food and other resource depletion, and mass migrations.\nNearly all of the major problems our world faces today worsen and multiply due to escalating global warming. All of the ecological, economic, and political problems listed below will cross-intensify and therefore worsen as average global temperatures rise.\nDespite 30 years of education, study, and discussion about the possible irreversible effects of human-caused carbon and methane pollution of our atmosphere, global warming temperatures have escalated to levels that may have already passed or be close to passing global warming tipping point with impacts that are irreversible. We must immediately reverse the continued rise of average global temperature by decreasing the human-caused production of greenhouse gases from the burning of fossil fuels. Failure to resolve global warming for ourselves and future generations is simply not a survivable option.\nPublicly declare that the national and international criteria for planning and implementing new laws to resolve the global warming emergency are to do only what is essential and effective in the properly prioritized sequence to keep us from crossing any critical global warming tipping points.\ncreate a revenue neutral, Fee and Dividend-based global warming reduction program.\nremove all government subsidies from fossil fuel energy generation.\nincentivize divestment from the fossil fuel energy generation industry.\ntax all fossil fuel profits at significantly higher rates.\nmandate that the fossil fuel corporations pay for all past and current environmental damage.\nmandate using Fee and Dividend revenue or other global warming-related revenues to provide generous government subsidies and incentives for expanding green energy generation and use.\nmandate using Fee and Dividend revenue or other global warming-related revenues to fund employee job retraining, as well as a business and nation recovery fund to assist all individuals, businesses, and nations that will suffer significant financial losses because of the rapidly falling use of fossil fuels.\nmandate using Fee and Dividend revenue or other global warming-related revenues to fund a global education and public relations campaign on why the public will have to comply with many new and difficult global warming reduction laws soon to be enforced by our governments.\nmandate using Fee and Dividend revenue or other global warming-related revenues to increase natural and technological carbon sequestration.\nauthorize the International Monetary Fund, The World Bank, and other national and international bank transaction clearinghouses to impose and collect global warming law violation penalty fees.\nmandate the creation of a separate global warming emergency recovery reserve fund equal to 5% of national GDP.\nfund research into new, appropriate technologies that may become our last hope and backup plan to remove toxic carbon and methane pollution from the atmosphere before we go over the climate cliff.\ncall for the immediate creation of a more accurate and complete global warming risk analysis, as well as mandating annual global warming risk analysis updates to be done by the respective intelligence agencies of each nation.\nAs global citizens of every nation on Earth, we ask you, our national leaders, to immediately convene with all other national leaders from every country to pass effective, verifiable, and enforceable new laws to resolve the escalating global warming emergency before it is too late, and to sustainably protect, preserve, and advance the continued evolution of humanity and life on Earth.\nStanding for the Future urges secular and religious people to unite in common cause: sparing our grandchildren climate chaos and sparing ourselves their condemnation. Standing for the Future views the climate emergency as the most urgent moral issue of our time. Together with Job One for Humanity , we invite people of all faiths, and none, to sign the petition below and share this link with others."
