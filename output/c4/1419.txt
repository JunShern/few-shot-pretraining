It's a quick and easy way to hide the elastic and make your ponytail or braid look even prettier. It\u2019s important that you slide the hairpin under the elastic band and that you twist the strand so that you can pull through the hair pin. Thanks for waching!\nThis is a video of the long awaited rubber band hair tutorial! There was a lot of interest and request for this rubber band style on my Instagram (@whippycake) and Snapchat (whippy-cake), and I was happy to hear you guys love it as much as I do.

FTC: This is not a sponsored video. As ALWAYS, the views and opinions in this video are strictly my own.\nHi Guys! In today's video we are going to do a waterfall braid using elastic bands. This style has been inspired by @abellasbraids and we added our own touch to get a really pretty hairstyle. This style is perfect for beginners because there is no need to hold strands of hair and the elastics are a good trick to make a waterfall style. You can do it on medium or long hair and it is a very good option for every/any day. If you don;t have enough time you can let the strands out whit no braids and the result will be beautiful as well. Hope you like this video as much as I do and give us a big TUMBS UP if so!!!!
