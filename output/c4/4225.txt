    "text": "This space has not seen much action lately so I'll post this here.\nThe younguns went to their 1st Hippology test session yesterday. They said it was a bunch of kids there from all around the Richmond area.\nFrom what we can get out of them, don't think the scores will be to high, but we can see a lot of desire to do better next time.\nThe 4H club they are in is new, so they really had not been taught what to expect. Said they enjoyed the work centers but that 133 question test took them by suprise.\nI loved hippology when I was in 4H. We didn't have a team until I was around 16 so it was a late start for me. That first year was an eye opener and we were a group that had been running for years and had past teams. Later I coached the younger teams also. It can be a lot of fun.\nWhat is the 133 question test? I'd like to try it, just to see if I know anything at all yet. Can you post it?\nI don't have the test they took. I did a yahoo search to see for myself what it was all about. Here is a link to a 10 page test(they said theirs was 10 pages).I guess most would be about the same. Several others on the search link.\nGood luck and don't look at the answers first.\nMy daughter is going to her first Hippology meeting on Thursday. It is also a new club and we are fairly new to 4H. She joined the local 4H Home Ec club this past fall and she just loves it.\nWhen I was young my big dream was to be in 4H. But I was from \"the City\" and whenever we would inquire about it as soon as they found out where I lived they would say \"we don't have clubs THERE\" and slide the virtual window shut. Fortunately things are different now. We live in a rural area, but people drive their kids all the way from \"the city\" to come to meetings. The leader said they expect parents to be involved and active, and I was like oooh, I finally get to be \"in\" 4H!\nYa but's where's the answers! Some of those aren't that easy!\nAlso there is one error in it. One thing I found with working with MI and WI's questions is that they aren't always totally correct. There was a few times I remember that we had to give a wrong answer because it was what they wanted. I don't remember any of them off hand but on that test Part 15 Foaling, #5 \"Total Albinism causes and iris that is nearly white with pigmentation only in the corpora nigra. This is often found in Palomino's, White horses or horses with a bald face. This color eye is called.\"\nThere are no Albino horses because horses do no carry the genes for it. And that is not a trait of the Palomino gene. So this is something to keep in mind. If you find a question that isn't totally correct ask someone if they want the answer the guides give or the correct answer. One time I did answer the question with both. It was something to do with colors, the guides were wrong but we don't find it in the resources at all. So I answered with the what the guides said and then corrected it. The wrong answer was what they wanted but it was changed for the next year.\nStormie; Could it be that some of these test Q & A's are not kept up to date? Information on horses is changing all the time, and some of it from 5 or 10 years ago is now outdated. Just thinkin' out loud .\nYeah, I couldn't find the answers either.\nAnd this is the Junior test? Wow.\nAre you sure it's not \"Junior year in vet school\" ??\nSome of those are tough!\nFB, hippology is the study of horses.\nFrom the Greek hippus, meaning horse.\nooops just gave you the test link.\nThat is part of it. They don't update things much but some of them are more area things like the snaffle vs curb or girth vs cinch. It hasn't been all that long that they got the ablino thing out enough and still you have people that believe it.\nohhh I like these, they are so different then the ones we had. But they need a lot of help on the color things. Bays have more then a black mane and tail and buckskins don't have dorsals only dun colors do and greys are more then black. I love horse colors those these things stick out like a sore thumb.\nYep, I know what you're sayin' about the \"bay\" thing. Terra has a black mane & tail but she's not a bay. Technically, she's a dark brown though I've heard it called liver chestnut, too... no black stockings.\nMy sister's horse is a chestnut out of a Chestnut and a dark palomino. From the chest up he looks bay but the chest down he is clearly chestnut. A few years ago we had got a huge group here at the farm for the vet, saved on the farm call I only paid like $5 for my part of it. The vet was doing coggins and vaccs. He wanted to put the gelding's color as Bay. This is a horse vet, and a good one. Luck's mane and tail are getting a little more red now as he ages but not much it still looks black until you get close.\nI have a Brown mare(my Coal). Before I got her I had been horse shopping for awhile. I had it set what I wanted and I had the time and money to wait for it. I wanted a foundation AQHA mare that was around 3-10 years old, broke or not, solid conformation, nice bloodlines for all around western, something I could ride and show and then use as a broodmare but I also wanted color, basicly NOT sorrel/chestnut or grey. I looked at so many horses that were not the color people said they where. Bays that were chestnut or brown. Browns that where chestnuts. A dun that was a bay, one that was a buckskin. A palomino that was a chestnut with flaxen. So by the time I got to Coal's ad I had to ask the woman if she was for sure a BROWN and not a chestnut. She is but man in the winter she is black. The only way to tell she is a brown in the winter is the tan on the nose. In the summer she bleaches out to be a dark bay with high black legs.\nBut I have to admit Coal was not what I wanted. She is not a show horse she was abused, a nut case because of it, her conformation is good but not what I was looking for. She does have a great pedigree for racing. She has come a long way and turned out to be a great trail horse for me. One that is as 'crazy' as I am and can keep up with me on wild rides. I have shown her and she has done well but she doesn't like it. I just felt so bad for her. She was so misunderstood I couldn't leave her there."
