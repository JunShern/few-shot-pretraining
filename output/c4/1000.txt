Stroudsburg?\nI will be working with teachers across the border in Blairstown, NJ this week but I am staying in Stroudsburg. Where's the best grub?\nI am half tempted to drive to Scranton to get my Dunder Mifflin fix, but not sure an Instagram pic in front of Poor Richard's Pub is worth the 2 hour round trip.\nRe: OT: Best Food in Stroudsburg/E. Stroudsburg?\nStroudsburg is one of those nice old Victorian towns that hasn't had its downtown abandoned or gutted. East Stroudsburg doesn't have the charm of Stroudsburg. There are some decent local non-chain places but nothing stands out in my memory.\nPoor Richard's is a bust ... unless you bowl.\nGet some Pizza by Alfredo.\nSeruous note the seafood place from the show is pretty legit.\nI sent you a pers. message. Please check.\nI know years ago you could go to the Steamtown mall (now known as the Marketplace) and get your picture in front of the \"Scranton Welcomes You\" sign that they aired during the opening credits of \"The Office\".\nDepends on how badly you want that pic. The entire Scranton-Wilkes Barre area is a desolate place (IMHO). If you went to Scranton you'd probably realize it was a mistake. Stroudsburg and East Stroudsburg are pretty nice. Are you working at The Blair Academy?\nDowntown Stroudsburg is your best bet most likely, it's definitely the more charming of the two town centers. East Stroudsburg is primarily residential and really functions as an extension of Stroudsburg as much as its own town. I was a big fan of the old Dansbury Depot, but after the fire it was replaced by Trackside Grill, which is fine, but more generic. In Stroudsburg I'm partial to the Sarah Street Grill but there are definitely a few decent options you have.\nCan we have a Dunder Mifflin thread? Man, do I miss that show.\nThanks for all of the great information. I am working with North Warren Regional HS. Sounds like I wait on Scranton until I head back that way next summer. Stroudsburg sounds like it\u2019s got plenty of options. Warrior gave me some good insight.\nYes, an Office thread would be awesome. Currently binging Season 8 and 9 while waiting for my flight from GR to Newark.\nSeasons 1-3 were some of the funniest televison shows ever in my opinion.\nDinner Party was a great episode, too. I still have no idea how they ever filmed that scene when Michael was showing off his 12\" Flat Screen. Amazing how they kept straight faces. On the outtakes they just couldn't do it.\nThe amazing thing is The Office is alive and well. It's reborn to this high school and college generation.\nThere are two or 3 blocks downtown with a bunch of restaurants and bars. A place called Yard of Ale is pretty good (more of an upscale brew pub feel, but they don\u2019t make their own beer), and there is a nice Irish pub a few doors down as well.\nRudy's Tavern in East Stroudsburg is a MUST!!!! Great bar food, and the bar bill won't bust your wallet! Log Cabin on Rte 46, just on the Jersey side of the Delaware is a great spot too!!!\nI wouldn't recommend Rudy's to a visitor looking to have a nice meal. Yeah the bar food is good, but it is more of a college, early twenties bar scene. $1 drafts and supers.\nI haven't visited the site much since the end of the season but just wanted to thank everyone for the suggestions.\nI stayed at the Hampton a couple of blocks from downtown so it was an easy walk to Happy Hour. Sampled several including Yard of Ale and then ended up at Siamsa Irish Pub for dinner.\nGreat area with great people on both side of the river. Maybe Hillsdale and the Warriors can hook up OOC sometime....or in the playoffs."
