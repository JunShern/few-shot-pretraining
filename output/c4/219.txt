    "text": "When private funding for the annual Incline Village fireworks display dried up in 2006, a group of concerned citizens, local merchants and community leaders got together and came up with the idea for Red, White and Tahoe Blue. A multi-day celebration of our country\u2019s independence, RW&TB features numerous events, concerts and one of the best fireworks shows in the nation. The festival is family-oriented with many events geared toward kids like chalk drawing and ice cream eating contests, a bike parade and a community fair and barbecue featuring carnival games, music and food. Other events include pancake breakfasts, a hometown parade, a veterans tribute and a wine and cheese tasting. Various bands and musicians play around town, and there\u2019s one big concert every year at the main stage on the Village Green (past acts have included Elvin Bishop, Billy Ray Cyrus and Grand Funk Railroad). The highlight of the whole celebration is when the Reno Philharmonic takes the stage as fireworks light up the sky, synchronized with the music. Incline Village\u2019s homespun Red, White and Tahoe Blue celebration has been rated one of the 10 best in the nation, and the fireworks rate in the top five. Many of the events are free but some have an entry fee. Please note that the population of Incline swells to more than triple its usual size Independence week, so you\u2019ll need to show up early for events and have patience. The beaches in Incline, where some of the events are held, are private and not accessible to the general public."
