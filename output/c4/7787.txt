We have seen many different mold cases from small to big that require different solutions. Some common examples of mold cases we\u2019ve seen would be crawlspaces with lack of ventilation or with foundation seepage, water damage from busted frozen pipes, unoccupied homes that haven\u2019t been maintenance, or even a previous water damage that wasn\u2019t properly taken care of. There are so many mold removal jobs Our Mold Cleanup Companies in Savannah have taken care of and they are never exactly the same. It all just depends on where the moisture is."
