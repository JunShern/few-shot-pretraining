This is my go-to when I\u2019m tired of chicken and/or sandwiches. It\u2019s fast, easy, and yummy!\nTuna is not only delicious and a great substitute for other meats but it has amazing health benefits. The health benefits of tuna fish include its ability to reduce cardiovascular conditions, stimulate growth and development, lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels, and help in weight loss. Tuna also has the ability to boost the immune system, increase energy, maintain the health of the skin, increase red blood cell count, prevent cancer, protect against various kidney diseases, reduce general inflammation, and inhibit cell membrane damage. You can read more about these benefits on a great post from Organic Facts.\nWhich tuna should I buy?\nMany people are already aware of some of cautions when choosing tuna. It has been found that farmed tuna fish (and all farmed fish) can have many harmful additives. This includes antibiotics, pesticides, Dibutyltin (a chemical used in PVC plastics), Dioxins, and can be harmful to the environment. You can read more about the harmful potentials of farmed fish from Dr. Axe\u2019s post. Wild caught tuna may be more expensive upfront but is worth it for the flavor, quality, and health benefits. I\u2019ve found amazing wild caught tuna at the local co-op!\nPlace all ingredients together in a bowl and mix. Enjoy!\nThis is also good in a wrap! Mix the ingredients and roll them up in your favorite tortilla."
