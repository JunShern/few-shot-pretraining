    "text": "(8) THIS SECTION DOES NOT APPLY TO AN INDIVIDUAL WHO CARRIES, 19 POSSESSES, OR TRANSPORTS A PISTOL IF ALL OF THE FOLLOWING 20 CONDITIONS ARE MET: 21 (A) THE INDIVIDUAL IS NOT OTHERWISE PROHIBITED FROM POSSESSING 22 A PISTOL. 23 (B) THE INDIVIDUAL IS AT LEAST 21 YEARS OF AGE.\nSo if you are using your gun legally and over the age of 21 you would be exempt from acquiring or registering your pistol with the state. Under 21 then you still need to register.\nYou would still be able to register your gun with the state if you so choose. While many of us would never do so there is a few reasons to do so. For example I would want my AR-15 pistol to be clearly registered as a pistol with the state should police give me an issue while using it as a truck concealed weapon for example.\nEnacting section 1. Sections 223, 227, 227a, 227c, 227d, 228, 7 231, 231a, 232a, and 234d of the Michigan penal code, 1931 PA 328, 8 MCL 750.223, 750.227, 750.227a, 750.227c, 750.227d, 750.228, 9 750.231, 750.231a, 750.232a, and 750.234d, are repealed.\nThis eliminates the requirement to have a CPL but still allows for issuing CPL. So unlike Vermont, Michigan citizens who so wish, can obtain a license to carry and receive reciprocity. Whose who do not and are over the age of 21 would legally be able to purchase and carry concealed or open without a permit. It removes the restriction on permit-less open carry in places that sell alcohol and such as well.\nOne thing it does lack however is any change to carry on school grounds. This legislation was not presented to gun groups prior to it being released and as such there is still much scrambling to see how this package of 7 bills affects gun rights. The initial look however is that this is amounts to permit-less purchase and carry either open or concealed in non pistol free zones.\nWhile MCRGO has shared this on their Facebook page but has made no official support for the legislation at this time it is under current review and an official stance is expected in the future.\nMGO has shared this on their Facebook page but has made no official support for the legislation at this time it is under current review and an official stance is expected in the next few days.\nMOC (updated below) are still reviewing this. We will update the post as new comments are released.\nMOC is still looking into the fine details of Representative Gamrat\u2019s bills, but so far we are very pleased at what we are finding. We believe these bills would be a tremendous step forward for Michigan gun owners and carriers.\nwish to have the license and receive reciprocity from other states.\nPurchase permit no longer required to purchase of a firearms for those over 21 years of age.\npossessing a firearm without a CPL or permission."
