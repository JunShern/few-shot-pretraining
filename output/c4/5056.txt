    "text": "Sedona-Oak Creek Unified School District #9 (Sedona), a district of 1,500 students located in Northern Arizona, consists of two K-8 and one 9-12 school. While the district may be small in terms of student population and number of facilities, administrators are proving large in terms of planning for the future. Specifically, the district is in the process of installing solar energy projects to reduce energy costs.\nAs is common in other states, Arizona school districts received a certain amount of money from the state every year that was earmarked to pay for utilities in excess of a baseline. In Arizona, that amount was based on a figure that was developed several years ago and was intended to help school districts offset fluctuations in utility rates. Since 2009, that help from the state has disappeared, and school districts now must pay for all utility costs from the same budget that funds the classroom teachers and supplies.\nThe first project, completed in spring of 2009, was a 100-kW, roof-mounted, thin film system located at Big Park Community School, offsetting approximately 35 percent of the school\u2019s electricity cost.\nThe largest project includes an 806-kW, ground-mounted, solar photovoltaic array at Sedona Red Rock High School, which was completed last fall. The system is not only an energy saver, but also a teaching tool for the science program at the high school.\nThe next project to come online will be a roof-mounted, crystalline panel system at the new district office, including a geothermal HVAC system and 48 kW of solar photovoltaics, which will offset a portion of the office\u2019s electricity.\nThe fourth project, at West Sedona School, is a rebuilt pool that will have a solar thermal system to heat the water in the pool, as opposed to using a gas boiler, the panels of which will double as shade structures for the swimmers. \u201cSo, there\u2019s a dual benefit to putting in the solar thermal system at the pool,\u201d says Dave Young, LEED-AP, Sedona\u2019s project manager via Arcadis, an international firm that manages the bond. The school will also boast a 58-kW, ground-mounted, solar photovoltaic system to help offset electricity costs.\nBecause it\u2019s a school district, Sedona didn\u2019t receive any federal incentives or tax breaks to reduce the cost of the projects. However, a $1.8-million rebate for the high school from local power provider APS reduced the cost of that project from $4.8 million to $3 million, Young notes. From this investment, the district will save 1.2 million kW hours per year at the high school, between 50 percent and 60 percent of its electricity consumption. Specifically, administrators anticipate saving more than $100,000 in the first year from the high school\u2019s system.\n\u201cThe obvious benefit of solar,\u201d says Young, \u201cis it reduces the amount of power the high school consumes. It also means that there is additional savings in the maintenance and operations budget, which provides teachers\u2019 salaries and school supplies.\u201d Plus, as utilities increase, the cost of the system won\u2019t go up \u2014 it\u2019s paid for and will keep on generating electricity.\nThe average payback for one photovoltaic system is about 12 years. And, because the four projects are different, each has its own payback period.\nPanel installation is easy \u2014 they simply plug together. If one panel stops working, the string (usually 12 to 15 individual panels) that it is attached to stops working, but all the other strings in the array continue to operate. To put that in perspective, the Sedona High School project includes 3,838 panels. If one panel stops working, an entire string of 14 stops working, but the remaining 3,824 panels remain in operation.\nSedona administrators have recognized several other bonuses of using solar energy. One is what Thomas calls the \u201ctouchy feely\u201d aspect \u2014 it\u2019s good public relations to say that you\u2019re using less electricity produced from coal-burning plants.\nIn planning for their future, Sedona administrators are getting more bang for their buck than they probably anticipated. Of course they knew they would realize huge savings from generating electricity via solar power, but did they anticipate the benefits of good public relations, keeping the investment local and a stronger science program? Regardless, they\u2019re clearly taking advantage of all that solar power offers."
