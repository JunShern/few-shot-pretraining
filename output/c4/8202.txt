Consequently these mouldings are quick and easy to install (typically in around half the time compared to plaster, without the need for a second person).\nNor are there the traditional difficulties, mess or wastage, saving the installer time and money. Furthermore there are none of the usual concerns about cracking or shrinkage normally associated with plaster \u2013 these ornaments will enhance the look of your home for many years to come.\nPre-primed, ready to paint or stain to the desired finish effect (with only a single coat required), users are realising that without doubt this is now the new \u2018traditional\u2019 product material to replace plaster mouldings.\nIf you would like a hard copy of either the Decor or Axxent brochures or a sample of the material, then please contact us."
