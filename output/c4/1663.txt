So, I had decided that whichever card I would make next would definitely have ribbons.\nThe card measures 6 x 5 inches. The white panel measure 5.5 x 4.5 inches.\nI have used 0.5 inch wide ribbons along with Penny Black- Party Time stamp sets(cupcake and happy birthday sentiment) for making this card.\nThe following couple of photos will give an idea of how I achieved this look with the ribbons.\nI coloured the cupcake using my Lyra colour pencils. Although initially stamped the cupcake using my \u2018London Fog\u2019 shade of Memento Ink, I re-did the cupcake outlines with my black Sharpie for sharper look.\n2.
