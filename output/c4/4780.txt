    "text": "Sardinia has a long tradition of horse riding which has perpetuated until the present day. Riding stables on practically every corner offer many different types of excursions suited to all kinds of levels, from beginner to advanced rider. You can take your pick from pony riding for kids, tours through romantic and secluded mountains over several days, and bikini-clad horse rides on the beach.\nSardinia\u2019s hilly expanse and endless beaches make the island a perfect arena for visiting horse riders. All that is to be heard is the panting of the horse, lazy insects buzzing and birds singing. You can smell the heady mixture of the macchia and the salty ocean as the sun warms your skin. In the evening when the sun worshippers leave their posts, you can gallop freely across the beach and its shoreline, even if you are a beginner. This is a good way to experience a different side of the island and discover spots that are inaccessible by car.\nThe locals have a special affinity to horses, which is evident at their spectacular riding festivals such as S'Ardia di Sedilo, where the Sardinians are keen to demonstrate their almost neck-breaking riding skills. Sardinia is one of the last regions in Europe to still home free-roaming wild horses. There are for example the very famous \"Cavallini of the Giara\" - miniature horses which are to be found only here. To read more about this specific race visit Sa Jara Manna."
