    "text": "It\u2019s been gorgeous here in Pittsburgh, this summer as cool and temperate as the last. I\u2019ve been carefully keeping track of the temperature and weather in this thread for three solid years, now, juxtaposing propaganda from the controlled press against other factual accounts.\nThe propaganda is tireless, and completely formulaic. Throughout this thread, and in this current post, you can see constant repetition of the words \u201cchilly\u201d and \u201ccooler\u201d instead of \u201ccold\u201d.\nA story below asserts \u201cthe beginning of August is going to feel cooler than average.\u201d See, it\u2019s not cold, it\u2019s cooler. And it\u2019s not cooler, it just feels cooler. Two layers of hedging, softening.\nAnd if it\u2019s just the beginning of August, how come this story from a week or so ago say \u201cExtended period of unseasonably cool temperatures ahead\u201d? .\nOne story I\u2019ve appended below is headlined: \u201cBreak Out Your Jackets\u2014August Is Going to Be Chilly for Much of the U.S.\u201d Directly below the headline is a video, showing a beautiful fall foliage scene, with this link for you to click: \u201cFall 2017 is going to be really hot\u201d.\nIt\u2019s tireless, it\u2019s repetitive, it\u2019s programming.\nThey pile on: \u201cThe lack of rainfall even plunged New England into an historic (albeit mild) drought.\u201d Wait. How can a drought be both \u201cmild\u201d and at the same time \u201chistoric\u201d? They typed that Satanic sentence up right as the nation dropped to its lowest drought level in history.\nIn another story, \u201cIt Won\u2019t Feel Much Like Summer in Parts of Central, Eastern U.S. Into Mid-August\u201d. See, you\u2019re just having a feeling \u2013 the impression the subconscious is left with is that therre\u2019s nothing factual or scientific about it. And it\u2019s not even that it won\u2019t feel like Summer. It won\u2019t feel much like summer. Again, two layers of hedging, softening.\nWhen things happen that go off message re: \u201cThe hottest year in the history of the planet\u201d, the words used include \u201cunexpectedly\u201d, \u201cfreak out\u201d and , \u201cbizarre\u201d.\nNot that the subconscious of the Ensheepled mind needs much assistance. Any straw will be grasped in order to refuse responsibility, to maintain programming \u2013 as the authors of the propaganda well know. That\u2019s why threadbare memes such as \u201cEl Nino\u201d (a quasi-magical, only-periodically-occurring, slightly-warmer-than-normal spot of water in the vastness of the Pacific Ocean), as well as \u201cRex Block\u201d and \u201cPolar Vortex\u201d are tirelessly put forth to keep your eyes off the larger phenomenon I\u2019m elucidating here.\nRemember: do not confront someone who wishes to remain in denial with a post such as this one. They will narrow their eyes, say, as required, either \u201cyeah, but that\u2019s HERE\u201d, or \u201cyeah, but that\u2019s THERE.\u201d There will be no a-ha moment, it doesn\u2019t work that way, I\u2019m afraid.\nBut propaganda that\u2019s completely disconnected from reality will with surety collapse on itself, will injure the propagandist, soon enough. It\u2019s an Inconvenient Truth.\nKnow anyone who\u2019s seen the just-recently-released retread of that film? You remember it, surely: the Most Important Film Ever Made, that is for some reason never shown on TV, nor in schools?\nJune 21, 2017 \u2013 Farmer\u2019s Almanac \u2013 How Hot Will Summer Be?\nFirst let\u2019s look back at last summer. It was slow to gain traction. We predicted that the real summer-like temps would arrive later in the season, and sure enough, it wasn\u2019t until late August and early September that the real sweatin\u2019 began. The lack of rainfall even plunged New England into an historic (albeit mild) drought.\nThis year, summer temperatures are expected to arrive right out of the gate with unseasonably hot and dry weather for the Rockies and Great Plains, as well as the eastern states.\nJuly 5, 2017 \u2013 Greenland just set the record for coldest July temperature ever reported in the Northern Hemisphere at -33C.\nTemperatures in Boston neared record lows for July 24, the service said.\nAugust 2, 2017 \u2013 Break Out Your Jackets\u2014August Is Going to Be Chilly for Much of the U.S.\nIf the news that the East coast, South, and Midwest will all experience hotter than average temperatures this fall made you long for cooler temperatures, here\u2019s some good news: Your wish is coming true this month (sorry, summer lovers!).\nFrom the Plains to the Eastern seaboard, the beginning of August is going to feel cooler than average, according to The Weather Channel. The unusual weather pattern is due to a southward dip in the jet stream that\u2019s bringing temperatures more than 25 degrees lower than average to areas east of the Rockies. Good news if you\u2019re ready to take your sweaters down from the attic, but if you\u2019re looking for a respite from the summer heat and you live in certain other parts of the country, you\u2019re out of luck.\nAreas in Texas and south Florida won\u2019t be affected by this wacky August weather pattern.\nTemperatures in Oklahoma have been unseasonably cool in the first half of the month.\nTemperatures are forecast to be higher late in the month but will still likely remain at or below seasonal levels.\nMost of Oklahoma has gotten significant rain in the past 10 days, generally ranging from 1.5 inches to over 7 inches. More rain is likely in the next week or two."
