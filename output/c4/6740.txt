    "text": "Over many long summer holidays (my parents were both teachers, meaning there were six whole weeks to be filled for the whole family each July and August) we explored the breadth and length of France, from \u00cele de R\u00e9 to the Dordogne, and back again. If Instagram had been invented back then, I like to think I\u2019d have found fame as a youthful social media influencer for French campsites.\nIn our now many trips, we have settled into a rhythm of long, lazy lunches, hiding from the hottest part of the day in one of those brilliant beach restaurants, then a trip to the supermarket on our way back to wherever we\u2019re staying. Dinner resembles those campsite suppers: bread and cheese features heavily, as does wine and chocolate (and some highly competitive games of cards). You can eat out in the evening, of course, but when lunch usually ends sometime around 4pm, I have yet to find myself quite hungry enough to spend another three hours eating, although the packed restaurants in the towns of Sant Francesc Xavier and Es Cal\u00f3suggest I\u2019m in the minority.\nShopping trips, however, are fleeting. Just a stop-gap between beach days, beach bars, and trips down dusty tracks in-between. France will always have a special place in my heart, but my affair with Formentera looks set to be a long one.\nServes the best mussels on the island in beautiful surroundings, with views out onto the beach and stunning hotel grounds. Factor in the pool and spa, and it\u2019s a great place to while away a day or more (the hotel rooms are pretty special, too). I love the commitment to sustainability as well \u2013 Gecko will be plastic-free by the end of this year.\nWash your sushi down with chilled white wine, then sit and watch the waves wash onto Playa Migjorn."
