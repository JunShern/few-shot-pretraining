    "text": "In a highly-anticipated release, the IRS provided a final set of guidelines for a complex area of the tax reform\u2014Section 199A, the 20 percent qualified business income (QBI) deduction.\nThe new QBI deduction, created by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, allows many owners of sole proprietorships, partnerships, S corporations, trusts, or estates to deduct up to 20 percent of their qualified business income. Eligible taxpayers can also deduct up to 20 percent of their qualified real estate investment trust (REIT) dividends and publicly traded partnership (PTP) income.\nThe QBI deduction is generally available to eligible taxpayers with 2018 taxable income at or below $315,000 for joint returns and $157,500 for other filers. Those with incomes above these levels are still eligible for the deduction but are subject to limitations, such as the type of trade or business, the amount of W-2 wages paid in the trade or business and the unadjusted basis immediately after acquisition of qualified property. These limitations are described in the final regulations.\nDiscussed below are the highlights of what was approved, denied and what needs future advisement.\nThis reduction applies only to the extent QBI was taken into account to determine these deductions.\nThis safe harbor is good news for a number of rental property owners; however, many do not keep time logs and may not meet the 250 hours test. Time spent by property managers, maintenance contractors and others all count towards the number of hours.\nIf the taxpayer does not meet the safe harbor, the business may still rise to the level of a trade or business under established definitions based on facts and circumstances. These circumstances are generally more taxpayer friendly since there are cases that qualify for a variety of rental activities. An exception would be a triple net lease arrangement.\nThe final regulations expanded the aggregation rules, permitting partnerships and S Corporations to report multiple trades or businesses on a combined basis.\nAggregation is an option, but not mandatory, for qualified taxpayers. It may be beneficial to combine a business that has high income but low wages with another business that has high wages and low net income, allowing the aggregation of total wages to increase the overall deduction.\nThe IRS provided further interpretation modifying and clarifying disqualified and non-disqualified service businesses in the fields of health, law, accounting, actuarial science, performing arts, consulting, athletics and financial management. Final guidance confirmed that if specified service activities exceed a certain threshold, it will render the entire business a specified service trade or business.\nThe final regulations made significant modifications on how to establish the asset basis used to calculate the QBI deduction.\nThe IRS has revised the rule for determining the unadjusted basis immediately after acquisition (UBIA) in nonrecognition exchanges, specifically section 351 or 721 exchanges. Similar revisions have also been applied to section 1031.\nWith regard to section 734, the IRS preserved the original proposed regulations, wherein the distribution of money or property by a partnership is not considered an \u201cacquisition\u201d as related to 199A purposes and therefore does not result in UBIA for the partnership.\nThe IRS did, however, change certain regulations surrounding section 743, adjustments reflecting the transfer of partner interest from one person to another. The final regulations state that a partner with a section 743(b) adjustment can consider the partner\u2019s \u2018excess section 743(b) adjustment\u2019 as a separate item of qualified property placed in service at the time the transfer of a partnership interest occurs.\nThe QBI deduction is available in tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2017, where eligible taxpayers will be able to claim it for the first time on their 2018 Form 1040.\nTaxpayers may rely on the initial regulations proposed in August 2018 for tax years ending in 2018, as the final guidelines issued in January 2019 will be applicable to tax years ending after they are published in the Federal Register, which was on February 8, 2019.\nThis update on the final guidance issued for the 199A deduction for pass-through entities only begins to untangle one of the most complex areas of the tax reform.
