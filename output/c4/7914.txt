    "text": "There are many defining moments in a child\u2019s life. Some we can\u2019t even remember, being born for example, when we first learn to walk, talk, eat without spitting up. Others are very memorable, our first day or school, our drivers test, that time in college when we realize we actually haven\u2019t learned how to eat without spitting up. These are defining moments for anyone in any generation, but for those of us who belong to \u201cThe X-Gen\u201d, \u201cThe Facebook Generation\u201d, or whatever you might call it, we all share a common bond, one common experience which took us from bright-eyed, hopeful child, to bitter, sarcastic adult. I\u2019m talking about our eleventh birthday, when we did not receive a letter to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.\nI remember the day vividly, and so do many of my friends. We all describe ourselves as being legitimately crestfallen when we realized that no letter was coming in the mail. And while a small percentage of us resorted to the hope that perhaps we were simply muggles in the midst of a hidden wizarding world, most of us came to the sobering conclusion that Hogwarts, and Diagon Alley, and Hippogriffs, and Whomping Willows, just didn\u2019t exist.\nAs I said before, this was hard to swallow for me, and many others of my generation. Reading J.K. Rowling\u2019s stories, we received a glimpse of a life that was full of excitement and adventure, a life with the promise of wands and trolls and ghosts and potions, a life where people who once thought of themselves as ordinary discovered that they were actually destined for extraordinary things.\nThis is why we love stories that involve magic. Magic has a certain alluring charm to it, a certain breathless wonder to it because it has the potential to carry us beyond our human capabilities. We were all disappointed not to find an owl with a letter on our window sill because deep down there is a part of each of us that desires to live Harry Potter\u2019s large than life life!\nThese songs are dealing with some ISSUES, issues that are larger than life. And if it\u2019s all true, if God really is this good and is able to do this many things and transform my life in this way, if it\u2019s all true, then it\u2019s like magic.\nBut there was one problem, as I much as I have dreamed and searched and hoped and prayed, magic is not real. I\u2019m never getting a letter from Hogwarts, no matter how hard I try. And regardless, God can\u2019t be magic. Prayer doesn\u2019t work like a wand does, you don\u2019t just say the right incantation, wave your Bible, and out pops a car. Magic works that way, God doesn\u2019t.\nSo there was only one conclusion I could arrive at. God is like magic, but better, because he\u2019s real. God offers us something better.\nCall me young, na\u00efve, idealistic, whatever, but I actually believe that the life that God offers and calls us to is a story that could compete with that of Harry Potter. God calls each and every one of us to a life of excitement and adventure, a life with the promise of wands and trolls and ghosts and potions(just accept the metaphor please J) a life where people who once thought of themselves as ordinary discovered that they were actually destined for extraordinary things. It\u2019s like magic, but better."
