    "text": "It\u2019s tempting to think of Stephen Karam\u2019s play \u201cThe Humans\u201d as \u201cjust another dysfunctional family drama,\u201d where tempers flare and secrets emerge as a middle-class family gathers around the table for Thanksgiving dinner.\nBut that would be doing this Pulitzer Prize-nominated play a huge disservice. One of the reasons the play resonates so deeply with audiences \u2014 so much so that it won the Tony Award for Best Play in 2016 \u2014 is that it\u2019s truly, uncomfortably, shockingly relatable. \u201cThe Humans\u201d is playing at Center Theatre Group\u2019s Ahmanson Theatre through July 29. Here are five reasons why the Blake clan is similar to your own.\nEnter to win $25 Lottery tickets to \u201cThe Humans,\u201d or get tickets now.\n1. Parents don\u2019t always understand your life decisions.\nWho hasn\u2019t heard, \u201cbut if you just moved back home\u2026\u201d once or twice after starting your new life in a new city? Brigid, a young musician, is trying to live her dream in New York City, but her parents are desperate to see their youngest return to Pennsylvania. Though they may not share her enthusiasm for the pre-war Chinatown duplex she\u2019s scored with live-in boyfriend Rich, they nonetheless brave ice and snow to spend Thanksgiving in her new digs. And perhaps most importantly, they also take her on a Bed Bath & Beyond run for household supplies.\n2. Being the significant other at the family holiday is awkward AF.\nPoor Rich. He makes such an effort to connect with the Blakes, but they constantly keep crossing signals, from football scores to dream interpretations to Rich\u2019s impending trust fund. But he does keep encouraging Deirdre to talk about her volunteer work, which scores some major politeness points.\n3. You can count on siblings to have your back.\nOlder sister Aimee is having a really hard year, after losing her job and girlfriend and being diagnosed with a major illness. But she still makes a point of telling Brigid she supports her, and acknowledges Rich\u2019s contributions to the meal and conversation when it seems as if no one else will.\n4. Sometimes just existing is hard (and expensive).\nSure, Brigid and Rich live in one of the priciest cities in the world, so paying the rent is obviously going to be a struggle sometimes. But as Erik reveals and Deirdre commiserates, you also can\u2019t necessarily count on a long-term job to reward you in the end. But families try their hardest to be there for you, whether that means sending a care package full of batteries and a camping lantern or caring for you as Alzheimer\u2019s causes your mind to slip away.\n5. Family knows just how to twist the knife.\nTo deliver a really cutting insult, you have to know just where it will hurt the most. There are several times where Karam has his characters deliver a remark so specific and hurtful that it makes the audience gasp in recognition. We may not mean to, but pointing out that Weight Watchers points are much easier to count if you don\u2019t fill up on appetizers or that \u201cfollowing your passion\u201d isn\u2019t a sustainable life choice hurts so much more because we recognize the kernel of truth hidden in there. And our loved ones do too."
