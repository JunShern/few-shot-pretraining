    "text": "Musicmetric, an online music analytics firm, has published a report, which it claims to be \u201cthe most in-depth study ever of the global digital music landscape.\u201d In the report, we find a list of the 10 countries in the world where the most music has been illegally downloaded during the first half of 2012.\nBut the report only lists total downloads. What happens if we, instead, put the number of downloads in relation to the size of the population and the number of Internet users?\nRanked by the number of illegal downloads of music worldwide the US tops the list with about 96.7 million, followed by UK at 43.2 million, and Italy with 33.2 million.\nWould you, therefore, assume that the US is the worst offender when it comes to snatching digital music from the jaws of the music industry?\nWe combined Musicmetric\u2019s findings with numbers for population and Internet users from Internetworldstats.com, and here\u2019s what we found.\nIf we take these numbers and present them in chart format instead, it\u2019s easier to see the differences between the countries. Then it\u2019s clear that although the US may be the country with the highest overall number of illegal downloads of music, put in relation to the the size of the population and the number of Internet users, it\u2019s not even close to the number one country.\nIn this view, Australia leads the pack with almost one download per Internet user (0.98) and 0.88 downloads per person. The US comes far behind, with 0.31 downloads per person and 0.39 downloads per Internet users. Internet penetration in the two countries differ a bit. In the US, Internet penetration is 78.3%, and in Australia it is 89.8%.\nFurthermore, India comes in at number 10, with just 0.01 download per person, and only slightly more, 0.07 downloads, per Internet user. With an Internet penetration of only just over 10%, that is perhaps not so surprising.\nTo conclude, it\u2019s of course not the case that one and only one user downloads each song. There may be, and probably are, users who download thousands of songs, and a majority who don\u2019t download any.\nBut putting the number of downloads in relation to the size of the population as well as the number of Internet users does reveal some interesting aspects of this issue, more so than just the number of downloads per country.\nSo, until we have numbers to put in a column called \u201cNumber of people who illegally downloaded music\u201d we probably have to make do with numbers like these.\n@justFen_ You\u2019re right, thanks, fixed now.\nAustralia is probably so high because we have a western music culture, getting most of our \u2018hits\u2019 from the US, while not having access to services like Pandora. Add to the mix the \u2018Australia Tax\u2019, and it\u2019s inevitable that we\u2019re going to source our music from somewhere convenient that doesn\u2019t try to rip us off."
