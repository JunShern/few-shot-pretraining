It's hilarious that Derrick Henry is making us look like a D3 defense.\nWhy can't he run like this against other teams?\nIf you have to play Henry you probably aren't in the playoffs. But if for some reason you are and you did...what a nice start to the week.\ntsbgrayghost wrote: Just looked. My opponent has Henry on his bench.\nMe too. He is starting Kamara and Lindsey. Henry is up to 37 points. They are never going to throw it to Davis now.\nHa! I'm starting Kamara and Lindsey.\nLove how the Jags defenders are all fired up to stop them....now.\nI have Chubb and McCaffrey.\n62.8 in my league on the bench for a non playoff team."
