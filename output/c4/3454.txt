    "text": "Winthrop Niles Kellogg was a psychologist in the field of behaviorism.\nJust like all behaviorists, he believed that man is just an animal defined by external factors and is \u201cprogrammable\u201d the way we wish to.\nBut Winthrop held the view that a chimpanzee as well could act like a human, if trained so.\nFor this reason, he conducted an experiment known as \u201cthe ape and the child\u201d.\nIn 1930, Kellogg \u201cadopted\u201d Gua, a female chimpanzee, at the age of 7 \u00bd months and reared with his son Donald, who was ten months old at the time.\nHe was dressing Gua with clothes, putting her to bed, teaching her to eat with a spoon and a fork, talking to her and he was tickling her.\nIn the beginning everything worked out nicely.\nGua was pretty much like her human brother. She had learned to feed herself, she played with toys for humans and she could grab her nose, if you asked her to do so.\nBut when Donald became 16 months old (and Gua a little over a year old), some differences between the two species made their appearance: Donald had started to speak, something that Gua \u2013 unsurprisingly \u2013 was unable to do.\nA few months later, Kellogg was forced to terminate the experiment. The reason? Instead Gua acting more like a man, it was Donald who behaved more like a chimpanzee!\nKellogg inadvertently proved that man mimics more than any other animal.\n\u201cIt stands to reason\u201d, I can hear you say, \u201cbecause a child copies the other\u2019s behavior. This is how it learns\u201d.\nThe thing is that another experiment proves us that man does not only mimic for learning reasons, but also to \u201cfit\u201d somewhere.\nBecause as a social being (Aristotle had said that man is a \u201cpolitical animal\u201d), it is too hard to realize themselves as a cast out.\nThe experiment was conducted in 1951 by the American psychologist J.E. Asch.\nAsch showed a line to six individuals and asked them to point its equal among three others displayed on another card.\nThere was no mistaking the right answer since the other two were clearly shorter or longer.\nFive out of six \u201cvolunteers\u201d were hired by the scientist. They were given directions to choose unanimously a wrong line, showing no doubt whatsoever for their decision.\nThe five individuals who were in the know would choose first and then, after having heard them, it was the turn of the actual subject to take their pick.\nWhile most of the subjects were seeing that the line chosen by the previous individuals was clearly the wrong answer, they were choosing the same (wrong) line!\nWhat is most inexplicable, and perhaps most important, is that when the subject was informed about the conspiracy, they did not admit that they chose the wrong line because they succumbed to the pressure of the\u2026 \u201cpublic opinion\u201d, but they would rather say that it was their fault, an oversight, a misjudgment.\nThey would rather believe that they did wrong instead of admitting that their behavior was sheep-like.\nAsch proved (or at least indicated because, as we have said before, there is no proof in social studies) that man\u2019s spiritual independency is but a myth.\nPeople want more than anything to belong to a group \u2013 or, at least, a subgroup.\nTo achieve this, we are willing to sacrifice any idea we might have that deviates from the norm in order to become likeable to the others.\nYou must be courageous to tell the truth (what you think that is the truth).\nWhen everybody tells you that the line you see is the right one whereas you see that it is the wrong one, it takes courage to stand up for what you believe.\nNot only because you might lose your job, but \u2013mainly- because you might find yourself ostracized \u2013 by your family, your friends, your fellow-citizens.\nIf you choose to stand alone, you could be tagged as crazy. That is man\u2019s biggest fear: to stay alone.\nTruth, just like freedom, takes virtue and courage.\nThis is the reason why people with such a high IQ level adopt such wrong views so airily.\nIt is not stupidity, it is cowardice.\nBecause man would rather walk with people whose thinking is flawed and come round to their point of view than stay alone by sticking to their own take of things.\nIt is very difficult, mentally speaking, to stand up against public opinion. And, most of the times, it is also dangerous.\nBecause the status quo is threatened much more by thinkers than killers.\nThe only true revolution will come when we start to think freely, without succumbing to the fear of the public opinion because, as Rigas Feraios said: \u201cOnly free thinking results in reasonable thinking\u201d.\n\u201cHow much truth could a spirit bear, how much truth could a spirit dare? \u2026 that became for me all the more the real measure of value\u2026 Error is not blindness; error is cowardice\u2026 Every acquisition, every step forward in knowledge is the result of courage and integrity towards our own self\u201d.\nIntegrity to ourselves. This is how everything we dream of begins."
