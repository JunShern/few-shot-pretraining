    "text": "My husband, Caleb, and I met in college and the rest, as they say, is history.\nAnd by we, I mean Caleb. Caleb decided we needed a break for a while.\nAnd by a while, I mean seven agonizing months during which I was devastated and pitiful and, well, I won\u2019t go into the gruesome details of it all because that\u2019s not the point of the story.\nThe point of the story is what I learned about the character of God. Any experience like that\u2014good or bad\u2014is a blessing.\nThe hardest thing about our time apart was my lack of control. I wanted Caleb to snap out of it already. Didn\u2019t he know this was not the plan? Didn\u2019t he know we were supposed to be together? I wanted power to change my circumstances. I wanted to manipulate the outcome by whatever conceivable means necessary, contemplating everything from slashing his tires, because he deserved it, to baking him a cake because the way to Caleb\u2019s heart is through his stomach. I knew I was right about us, so I wanted to just go ahead and speed through this little break up, thank you very much.\nSpoiler alert: Caleb and I were married a year later. But it\u2019s not because of anything I did. In fact, I\u2019m convinced the only reason we ended up together is because of what I didn\u2019t do. I did nothing at all, except mourn. That, I did entirely and frequently and outwardly. Let\u2019s just say I fully wore out my people.\nThis took all the self control I could muster.\nAnd when that didn\u2019t work, I tapped into God\u2019s all-sufficient grace. Rather than force, coerce, or manipulate, I did the completely opposite, counter-intuitive thing: I surrendered. I bore the heartache. I submitted to the reality of the situation. I accepted each painful moment as grace. I put all my faith in God seeing me through. I\u2019m not saying I did any of it gracefully; I\u2019m just saying I did it.\nRather than try to control Caleb, I controlled myself.\nI learned the hard way why self control is a fruit of the spirit\u2014because it\u2019s who God is.\nThe relationship between God\u2019s love and God\u2019s power is mysterious. So often, the two seem to be dissonant at best and complete opposites at worst.\nPerhaps we could broaden our understanding of the word power, and that would help us a bit.\nIt\u2019s easy to understand God\u2019s power as decisive and proactive, an outward exertion of might, and it is. But, have we ever considered how much power it takes to contain all of that? That God is also able to restrain his own power is revealing of just how powerful God is.\nAnd that God is willing to restrain his own power is revealing of just how loving God is.\nGod\u2019s self control is where his love and power become synonymous. They are not competing enemies, but complimentary friends. This is how John Wesley could maintain that God\u2019s \u201creigning attribute\u201d is love. Now I get it.\nIt turns out I was right about Caleb and me. But God has always known (and now so do I) that the ends do not justify the means where human hearts are concerned. Not even being right. After all, God is always right about us. The best control can do is the appearance of devotion, the worst is immediate and permanent back-fire. But, self control is our best shot at authentic, lasting relationship.\nWhile we are not sad our little hiatus is long over, we are grateful for how we grew because of it. If nothing else, we don\u2019t ever wonder if life would be better alone. Been there, done that, and it\u2019s not better. Most of all, we saw deeper into God\u2019s character. Rest assured that He\u2019s exactly who He says He is, and He\u2019s as good as can be.\nView our Top 10 Books on Arminianism.\nView our Top 10 Books on Responding to Calvinism.\nGood article. As Roger Olson says, \u201cGod is sovereign over his sovereignty\u201d. I like how you directed it back to \u201cGod is love\u201d.\nThanks for being open about what you\u2019ve learned and sharing it with others. Good stuff!\nYes, Ashlee. You were one of my people that I \u201cfully wore out.\u201d Thanks for being with me then and for so many other times (even now)!\nanother case of the apple not falling far from two wonderful trees. Thank you.\nHi Davey! You know the trees from which I fall?"
