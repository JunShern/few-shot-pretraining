    "text": "Instagram can make you feel inspired, even happy, if you know the right places to look, like former editor Susan Kaufman\u2019s feed. I have known Susan, though not very well, throughout our magazine careers; lastly she was the founding editor of People\u2018s popular Style Watch magazine. Rather by coincidence (and now by design), Susan started chronicling the areas around her two homes in New York City and Amagansett on Instagram, and in the process created a second career by highlighting the beauty on streets she had walked down but ignored for years. She sells her photos to prestige real estate companies, guest blogs for sites, and has new partnerships on the horizon. Best days to shoot? Non-sunny days (too many shadows). Most popular season? Anything with snow (she bundles up and runs out the door when the first flakes start to fall.) Here she shares what she loves about her new job, the women who inspire her and her five wardrobe go-tos she relies on to get the shot.\nWhat was your career path to date? I worked in magazines my whole life. I was a fashion editor\u2013I did shoots, styling, production. And then I became the founding editor of People Style Watch, so I oversaw all the writing and ideas, worked on the business and partnerships, and all kinds of adult responsible things. From Glamour, to Mademoiselle, to US Weekly, to People, to Style Watch\u2013I was in the industry for 30 plus years.\nWhen the publishing industry sort of imploded, I knew that time was going to come where I had to make a switch into something else. While I was the editor at Style Watch Instagram started happening. I couldn\u2019t relate to Twitter. But with Instagram I thought, \u201cHere\u2019s something I can relate to because it\u2019s a visual, and it\u2019s like putting a gallery together.\u201d So I started taking pictures on it probably 2012, \u201913, while I was still working.\nBacking up, I did photography professionally while I was at Mademoiselle and Glamour.\nWhat kind of photography? Fashion and beauty. When I was at Mademoiselle in the early days I was the editor of a lot of front of book shoots. I would work with these young photographers, I would book the models, style the clothes, find the location, do everything except take the picture.\nWhen I worked with a good photographer it was all lovely, and when I worked with someone who didn\u2019t know what they were doing I felt like, \u201cYou know what, just give me the camera. Let me take the picture.\u201d At a certain point I decided, \u201cI\u2019ve just got to learn how to do this.\u201d So I went out with a photographer friend, Christopher Micaud, and I bought a Nikon with a portrait lens. He showed me how to use it with f-stops, and I took one year at Parsons and I learned printing and all of that.\nThey started giving me jobs at Mademoiselle, and when I moved to Glamour I said, \u201cYou know one of the contingencies for coming here is that you let me shoot.\u201d They said, \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d So I started shooting front of book stories, fashion and beauty. And then I did some actual large portfolios.\nThat\u2019s amazing because I can\u2019t think of one editor who is also a photographer. Can you imagine what your Instagram would have been like then if had existed? I think about that because I used to do my own little books. I had this machine where you put the slide in, and then you pulled out this Polaroid. The quality of the Polaroid was just gorgeous; I would make these little books. I would have slides of Harbor Island\u2013the beautiful little candy-colored cottages and details. They were almost like mini Instagrams.\nDo you still have them? I do. But the ability to take pictures on this phone is a revelation. When I was at Style Watch, the other thing that was the aligning was the Fitbit came out. I got on this kick where I was wearing my Fitbit and was like, \u201cI\u2019ve got to walk.\u201d Before and after work, or if I was going on an appointment somewhere, I would start taking different routes and walking.\nWhen I stopped working and I had time, I was walking, looking, and falling in love with New York again. That\u2019s kind of the genesis of it.\nHow do you describe your photography? What genre is it? It\u2019s hard to categorize. It\u2019s not really about the architecture\u2013it\u2019s about the charm. I hashtag all of my pictures #socharming because that\u2019s the context. It has to have some charm to it, some details, some prettiness, some human side of New York and the Hamptons, and sort of old-world charm. But I guess it could fall into travel, lifestyle, architecture.\nBeyond that, growing up I always loved architecture and I\u2019ve always been attracted to anything that is aesthetically pleasing or beautiful design-wise. And the discovery process of walking through the West Village and reading the plaques of who lived somewhere. Or discovering these little streets. Then I go home and I Google and get all kinds of information. There\u2019s this process of discovery, and history, and learning something new. All those things that make it really fun and exciting.\nWhat do you love about doing it the most? Having been in magazines and being a visual person, to have control over this gallery that is a total expression of what I personally like, and what my aesthetic is, and treating it almost like a little mini magazine where I can look at the \u201clayout\u201d. You get instant feedback. you start realizing what people are responding to, and you can almost predict what\u2019s going to do well and what\u2019s not.\nEveryone is looking for purpose in life, and you think, \u201cOh, it\u2019s just Instagram. What\u2019s the point of all this?\u201d But, honestly what\u2019s going on in the world is so depressing, at the very least I\u2019m putting out something beautiful and positive every day, and I hear that feedback from so many people.\nAnd I got this comment from this woman in Sydney, Australia. She\u2019s wrote, \u201cYou\u2019re the first thing I look at when I wake up. And I always go to that. And my husband thinks I\u2019m crazy, but it makes me so happy.\u201d Nothing could make me happier than getting a comment like that.\nI also get a lot direct messages, \u201cI\u2019m coming to the Hamptons, I\u2019m coming to New York, where should I go?\u201d I\u2019ve become a mini tour guide, and have made up templates for specific streets, buildings.\nMini walking tours! What inspires you? Beauty. I also like things that have history and a backstory to them.\nYou spend your time between Greenwich Village and Amagansett, how does the dichotomy of being in these two different places affect your work? The Hamptons are wide open\u2013there\u2019s sky, there\u2019s air, there\u2019s the beauty of nature, there\u2019s the beach. I feel that Sag Harbor is the West Village of the Hamptons. It\u2019s where I love to stroll. I love the smaller houses, I love cottages. There\u2019s again that sense of history. And the light there is just\u2026that\u2019s why painters have always gravitated there, the light is so beautiful.\nEvery time I get off the Jitney in New York in Midtown, I\u2019m shocked. I just get this jolt of noise and energy and it\u2019s kind of crazy. It takes me about a day to readjust. I love the city because I can walk anywhere, I can go to lots of different neighborhoods.\nDo you walk so many more miles than you ever used to now?I walked six miles yesterday. Not every day is like that. But that\u2019s part of my daily goal, to walk at least three miles, take at least a few pictures.\nThree words that describe your work: Charming, pretty, inspirational.\nThree words that describe you: Curious, and I think that\u2019s why I ran magazines, I\u2019m always looking for something new. Responsible, which goes along with common sense, and sensible, and hardworking. Definitely very responsible.\nWomen you identify with or admire: That one isn\u2019t hard at all because my grandmother and my mother were absolute \u2026 I\u2019m so really lucky. My mother\u2019s mother moved from Akron, Ohio when she was 70 to Greenwich Village. She started traveling the world by herself when she was 50. She had incredible style. She was the most curious, energetic person. She went through Afghanistan on a bus through the Khyber Pass, by herself in the 70s. She lived in Portugal, where she started writing a book. She she took me to Europe for the first time, just the two of us, when I was 14, for six weeks.She walked so fast in her 80s I couldn\u2019t keep up with her. And she was one of my best friends and just really inspiring.\nMy mother is a doctor and she\u2019s 91. She plays tennis every week. She still has an office at the hospital, she\u2019s on boards. She just started doing voter registration because she needs people to vote. She plans trips, she took our entire family to Peru last summer and climbed up Machu Picchu.\nAt 91. She\u2019s going to be 92 in June. She\u2019s got so much drive and integrity, and is the most intelligent person I know; she makes me feel like a slacker.\nYou have some fearless women in your life!\nLife goals: To stay out there, stay curious, be nice to people, and try and make this world a slightly nicer, better place because it\u2019s really not at the moment. To stay healthy. Simple things. I don\u2019t have lofty ambitions. I feel like I\u2019ve accomplished a lot, and now I want to enjoy my life, and I want to enjoy people, I want to keep meeting people, and I want to keep learning.\nDaily goals: Walk at least three miles, post a good picture.\nDaily rituals: I really get up early and make myself a cup of coffee. If I\u2019m at the house I\u2019m with my husband and dog, a black Lab. So it\u2019s all about the dog early in the morning; I have to pet him for at least 15 minutes. Then I read the New York Times, I post. In the city, and also at the house, my main ritual is after I\u2019ve done everything I need to do at home, around 9:30 AM I go to Jack\u2019s Coffee. There is one in Amagansett and one on West 10th Street. I have my morning second coffee and that\u2019s when I do all my social media stuff. I follow people, I comment, I catch up with things, that sort of my me time to just focus.\nI never feel dressed without\u2026Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer and Lancome Hypn\u00f4se mascara.\nWriters and/or books that have opened a new world for you? I came up with 100. I don\u2019t know what to do.\n\u2026 that might be too many.\nI have a lot. I\u2019m a really avid reader and so many books have affected me in so many different ways. If I had to narrow it down, I love Edith Wharton; House of Mirth is one of my favorites. Growing up, this is cliched, but Little Women really opened my mind to many different ways of being. I wished I could be more like Joe, but I probably wasn\u2019t. Alice Munro is the best short story writer ever. And then on the flip side I love David Sedaris. Gary Shteyngart, A Super Sad True Love Story, still freaks me out about social media and that was a really good book. Last but not least I\u2019m obsessed with India, A Fine Balance, by Rohinton Mistry, is an epic book which I would recommend to everyone.\nSusan\u2019s Flair Five: Xirena shirt, $184; Madewell jeans, $128; Adidas Stan Smiths, $117; Jenni Kayne bag, $475; Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer, $44.\nA perfect evening is\u2026.with my husband and dog at our house. He barbecues, we binge watch something on TV or watch a movie, and it\u2019s just super mellow.\nA table is never set without\u2026.flowers. My favorite are peonies.\nHandwritten notes or email? Absolutely handwritten. But if they\u2019re younger, probably an email.\nFavorite artists: I\u2019ve always gravitated towards photography so Diane Arbus, Helen Levitt, Mike Disfarmer, who you\u2019ve probably never heard of.\nHe did incredible portraits. They found this trove from 1939 to \u201945 of families, they\u2019re so beautiful. I love Avedon. Artist-wise I love Matisse, Picasso, Cy Twombly.\nFive things that make a perfect room: Books, photographs, a chic but comfortable sofa. It\u2019s the personal things that make a room, that tell your story. I lean towards a little more maximalist than minimalist.\nAlways in your handbag? My Mophie. God forbid my battery dies. It\u2019s happened. I learned my lesson.\nYou can tell a lot about a woman by? Her shoes.\nWhy? I just think it tells you whether they\u2019re into being comfortable, they\u2019re super stylish, they\u2019re trendy, or they\u2019re practical.\nDestination wish list: Next, I am going to Paris with my husband because we both love it, and we\u2019ll be celebrating my birthday there in June.\nI\u2019d really like to go to Copenhagen and Istanbul. I\u2019d like to go back to India. There\u2019s a lot I haven\u2019t seen that I would love to explore. And I lived in Italy three times for a total of two years, but I\u2019ve never been to Puglia and I\u2019d really love to go to Puglia. And Portugal.\nBiggest splurge you don\u2019t regret: Staying at the Oberoi Amarvilas in Agra when I visited the Taj Mahal. It was the most expensive hotel I\u2019ve ever stayed in that I paid for. It was a huge splurge and it was 100% worth it.\nFavorite small indulgence: Cappuccino and a croissant, or a really good slice of pizza.\nAlbum currently on repeat: I don\u2019t have a specific album, but I always love to listen to Stevie Wonder from the 70s. Any time it pops up on my iTunes I\u2019m deliriously happy.\nScent that brings back memories: Bain de Soleil\u2013the best beach smell ever.\nLucky charm: I don\u2019t really have one, but my dog is named Lucky.\nSunday morning means\u2026.The same as Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. Except for the Sunday Times, because I\u2019ll start on the crossword puzzle. And I love the CBS This Morning Sunday show. They have so many interesting stories.\nFavorite hour of the day: 6:00 AM. I love having my coffee and being really chill. When I look out the window in the city no lights are on, it\u2019s still quiet.\nI love this! That comment from the woman in Sydney\u2026about the first thing that she looks at and it makes her happy? That is how I feel about The Flair Index! I look forward to it everyday. Thank you!\nJust discovered \u201cThe Flair Index\u201d through Sue Kaufman. I love to follow Surbin her NY/Hamptons adventures. CBS Sunday Morning should do a piece on her!! Enjoy Paris and look forward to your posts.\nNice profile and a thoughtful glimpse into your process! Susan, you have such a great eye!\nI adore Susan\u2019s IG. My son just moved to NYC and it makes me feel more connected with him. This story of Susan\u2019s background and look into her life will make me enjoy it so much more! Thank you.\nSuch a great, personal, inspiring article! Read it first thing this morning as I look for Susan\u2019s feed first as well. Thank you for an easy to read, comprehensive, totally positive, personal interview! I love that format for getting to know someone and she is one I wanted to know!! What an interesting and admirable journey she has had that has now led to such an inspiring portion of my day! Thank you!\nI would love to see/hug you in Paris and meet your very lucky husband.\nProud to know your inner & outer beauty since Madamoiselle magazine.\nAbsolutely love Susan! I look forward to her insta images and stories everyday. I love that her images are \u201cfound\u201d right before your eyes. Thank you for more insight about the woman behind the lens. She really is so charming and real!\nWell done! A good and beautiful life for a good and beautiful person. Not sure how I find her instagram a few months earlier but I\u2019m inspired to capture more of the college town in the upper south where I happen to live. And get up earlier!!"
