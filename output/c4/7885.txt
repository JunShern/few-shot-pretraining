    "text": "This page tests the new input values of HTML5.\nSee also the mobile table.\nLast updated on 2 March 2015.\nThese six definitions don\u2019t go for all input types or browsers. In the table below I indicate for each type which of the six are relevant.\nThe Chromia offer a dropdown under an arrow, and match the predefined values from start; i.e. entering a 'p' only shows option 'ppk' since that starts with a p.\nIE does the same, except that the dropdown automatically opens when you focus on the field.\nFirefox doesn\u2019t show anything initially, but substring-matches whatever you fill in; i.e. entering a 'p' shows both options since both contain a p.\nThe Chromia support all except datetime.\nOn Mac, the Chromia always show US-formatted dates and times. As far as I know there\u2019s no way to change that. Windows listens to the user preferences and switches time and date formats accordingly.\nUsing the input itself is annoying, but the Chromia also offer some good popup date pickers for everything but time.\nThe most annoying one is time, which requires an am/pm input. Entering 14:33 is not possible. However, the server receives a 24hrs-formatted time anyway.\nWith dates the server received yyyy-mm-dd; with weeks yyyy-Www (where the W is an actual 'W').\nIE10 and 11 remove the value onblur if it\u2019s not a number. This is a useful bit of interface other browsers should copy.\nMac browsers except Firefox give the field rounded corners, but that\u2019s the full extent of the support for this type. To be fair, I don\u2019t know what else they\u2019re supposed to be doing.\nI don\u2019t know how to define support because I don\u2019t know what this type is supposed to do.\nThe browser automatically focuses on this field when the page is loading.\nAllows users to upload multiple files at once.\nThe value must conform to the regexp pattern, or submission is halted.\nThe error message contains the element\u2019s title, if any.\nThe placeholder text is shown as long as the field is unfocused and the user has not entered another value.\nUser cannot enter a value in the form field.\nForm submission is halted if a required field does not have a value.\nSafari doesn\u2019t send a wrong value to the server, but doesn\u2019t alert the user that something is wrong, either. Pressing on the arrows brings you back to the expected 3-6-9-12 range.\nIE tells the user to enter a valid value but doesn\u2019t tell the user what a valid value looks like.\nSafari removes the value and sends the rest to the server. This is BAD since the user has no clue that his submission has gone wrong.\nFirefox and the Chrome-based browsers show an error message with the closest legal values.\nI removed them, so they\u2019re not tested for newer methods and properties that they don\u2019t support anyway. However, I copy all information from older versions of the Tables.\nIf IE8 supports a method or property I never tested before I have to guess if IE7 and lower also support it. In general I assume they support the Microsoft-invented properties, but for others I will occasionally have to add a \"Don\u2019t know\" entry. If IE8 does not support something I never tested before, I assume IE7 and lower also don\u2019t support it.\nOn Microsoft Remote Desktop, as indicated at Remote IE. This is not Spartan, but an IE that runs EdgeHTML, the new rendering engine.\nAll downloaded from modern.ie. I use VirtualBox, and downloded the Windows 7 systems for all browsers but IE11, which runs on Windows 8.1.\nThe non-IE Windows browsers all run on the IE9/Win7 virtualization.\nUbuntu 12.04 on pretty old hardware. Not fair for performance comparisons."
