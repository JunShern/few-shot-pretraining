    "text": "It\u2019s been a while since we had a dog underfoot and this one specialises in getting as underfoot as possible. If not that, he\u2019ll be in someone\u2019s lap \u2013 a 22.5 kg lap dog.\nWhen I take Dog for a walk up the main street he gets sooked-over big time- \u201cAw what a cute Staffie \u2013 is he friendly?\u201d Well, he does have a green harness and lead with \u201cfriendly\u201d emblazoned upon it, so, yeh. We are just baby-sitting this one, and I use the word advisedly as he is an anxious dog who (a) does not like to be outside when all the humans are inside, and (b) dislikes being left alone for more than two or three hours. This makes a weekend trip to Brisbane for the ballet just a bit tricky.\nHe\u2019ll lie doggo on the back seat of the car for a lengthy time but then starts whining and the whining turns into screaming. Oh, you know this behaviour? The other thing Staffies do is a supressed excitement grunt not unlike Marge Simpson\u2019s hhmmnn (when Homer is being irritating).\nOn Wednesday night Dog was in his element \u2013 a choice of laps to sit in with the ritual watching of the State of Origin. He got excited and confused with all the yelling and cheering in the 78th minute. Last time (when Queensland was beaten), we made him wear a maroon beanie and put photos on Facebook.\nIf you inhabit Facebook you will see a lot of dog photos (and videos) including one that had 17 million views.\nThe obvious question is who watched these videos and why? Other dog owners, I\u2019m guessing.\nThe RSPCA says there are 4.5 million dogs in Australia, with 39% of households having one.\nDogs in Australia experience lifestyles ranging from the cossetted fur babies who have the run of the house, their own beds (usually at the foot of the humans\u2019 bed), pet insurance, gourmet pet food and the vet on speed-dial. In the middle are working dogs; guiding disabled people, sniffing out drugs or explosives, guarding junk yards, tracking bad guys, herding sheep, baling up pigs or hunting down rabbits. At the other end of the scale are the neglected dogs, chained up all day while the owners are away and often abandoned once their owners realise how much work is involved.\nMany \u2018rescue\u2019 organisations have been formed to take neglected dogs away from bad circumstances, to rehabilitate them and foster them to caring families. One such foster-Dad was telling me his rescue dog flinches whenever someone nearby swears loudly. So dogs get PTSD too.\nWe could have a lengthy debate about dogs and their respective levels of intelligence. German Shepherds are said to have the intellect of a seven-year-old child. One night we were watching Inspector Rex (remember Rex?) on our big screen TV, positioned against a lounge room wall with our bedroom on the other side. Previously we had thought our female Alsatian was uninterested in TV. But then Rex appeared and went \u2018woof\u2019. Our dog scampered behind the TV, then into our bedroom and came out a few seconds later with a perplexed look.\nThe difference between the German shepherd and the Staffie is the latter will come when called. Our Shepherd would spot some other dog on the other side of the park and off she\u2019d go (at pace), coming back when she felt like it. She was too smart to try crossing Annerley Road on her own, but too dumb to open the side gate once she did come home.\nI had to bow to her encyclopaedic knowledge of dog breeds. On the surface, this is a fairly useless skill. But you can start conversations with complete strangers and some of them may end up giving you directions or sharing lunch on a train (Italians take their dogs on trains).\nUnfortunately, dogs go in and out of fashion. Teenagers (\u2018I want a puppy\u2019), will pick whatever type of dog their peer group likes at the time \u2013 (Rottweilers r cool!) Older people, perhaps influenced by popular media, want a dog like the one Madonna has, or Prince Harry. Back in the 60s and 70s, Afghan hounds were popular, then Irish setters, breeds known for shedding and for not having much between their ears.\nMany people buy or adopt a dog on a whim and quickly come to the conclusion that they are too much work. For the 61% of households who don\u2019t own a dog, here\u2019s what can happen if you give in to requests for a puppy.\nIf you want to travel, there are only three options: a dog and/or house sitter, a kennel or the dog goes with you.\nWhen we travelled around Australia in 2015, it seemed every second caravanner had at least one dog. These people frequently use free camps because so many caravan parks have a \u2018no dogs\u2019 rule. We said hello to a couple travelling in a Toyota Hiace pop-top motor home. They showed us their set-up \u2013 two single beds and a dog bed in between for their Labrador!\nNice doggy \u2013 sit, stay.\nI\u2019m joining in a St Vinnies fundraiser for homelessness next Thursday (29th). There are some 1500 homeless men, women and children on the Sunshine Coast, including some in our small town. I hope you can help meet my target of $500 (the regional target is $100k). Think of me and 80+ others next Thursday, with our sheets of cardboard, soup and rolls and (hopefully adequate) sleeping bags."
