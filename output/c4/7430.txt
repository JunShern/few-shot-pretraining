    "text": "Elijah went through his usual Saturday morning ritual, sitting on the old recliner in the living room, eating a bowl of cereal, and watching cartoons. Afterwards he thought about going for a walk around the neighborhood. It seemed like he had been stuck inside the house forever. He looked out the screen door only to find that there were still reporters hanging around outside and he just didn't feel like dealing with them today.\nHe turned the page to Genesis chapter one and began to read. It surprised him how little he knew about the events of the creation. Funny how different it was compared to the theory of evolution that he had been studying at school. He was never sure how he felt about evolution. He just figured that God fit in there somehow and learned enough about it to pass the exams.\nHe had been reading for a while when Becca came bounding down the stairs. Like everyone else, she was hiding out at home and had spent the morning in her room. Elijah said good morning without looking up from the page he was on.\n\u201cAbout the creation,\u201d replied Elijah vaguely.\n\u201cOoh! That was a hot topic at school last year. Several school board members tried to have these stickers like put inside the biology books. The stickers said something about evolution being a theory and should be studied like one. There was a big debate over it. Even an article in the school paper,\u201d Becca said as she sat down beside her brother to look at the open book.\nDespite his not looking up, Elijah had indeed been listening. It took a minute for him to digest what Becca had said. Did God use science to create the world instead of supernatural means? Was evolution part of the creation process or did God do it some other way? Either way, he would have to think about it more before he could make up his mind.\nElijah was enjoying the conversation. This was far more enlightening than just hearing science and religion bash each other. He may not have all the answers or proof for or against evolution, but perhaps he didn\u2019t need to. If God thought it was important He would have included it in the vision. Either way, Gram\u2019s definitely right, why we're here and where we\u2019re going is far more important.\n\u201cSpeaking of church, have either of you thought about where you want to go?\u201d Gram inquired.\nElijah and Becca looked at each other. \u201cI\u2019m not sure yet,\u201d they said in unison.\n\u201cWell let\u2019s discuss it over lunch,\u201d Gram replied. She called upstairs for Dad to come down to eat then walked into the kitchen.\n\u201cI thought we were going to our old church,\u201d Dad replied, surprised by the question.\n\u201cNah, that's O.K., Gram. I'm good with wherever you guys decide,\u201d Becca replied without looking up from her lunch.\nElijah remembered what Ben said about Becca's fight with Mark Roche at school. He could see a hint of anger on her face. She was still keeping quiet about it. He desperately wanted to tell Becca how much he appreciated her sticking up for him, but he still felt it best to wait for her to bring it up.\n\u201cHold your horses. Elijah still gets his say too,\u201d Gram reprimanded.\n\u201cThe Methodist church sounds fine, Gram! I haven't really felt strongly about any church in particular,\u201d Elijah answered.\nElijah sat straight up in bed when the alarm went off. He had set it for 8 A.M. and tried going to bed early, but the excitement of going to church kept him from sleeping. Giving up, he finally got out of bed and got back on the \u201cYoung Prophet's Society\u201d website. There were plenty of new topics. More than he knew he could read in a single night. He sifted through the titles looking for one to stand out. One post about evolution caught his eye and Elijah read through it. There was lots of talk about \u201cmissing links\u201d and assumptions needed for carbon 14 dating, whatever that was. When the screen started to go blurry through his heavy eyelids, he decided to give sleep another chance.\nIt seemed like he had just fallen asleep when the alarm went off. Despite his physical exhaustion, the exhilaration of going to church prodded him out of bed. He went down stairs still wearing the sweat pants and t-shirt that he had slept in. Gram, as always, was already up and about. She was moving around in the kitchen getting breakfast ready for everyone.\nElijah smiled and sat down at the table. It looked like the whole house was feeling as anxious about church as he was.\nBecca was quick to jump in line. She didn\u2019t want to appear vain, but she did want to show off her favorite dress. \u201cAhh, you look lovely dear. Like an angel,\u201d Gram\u2019s comment made her blush.\nElijah stepped forward to be inspected. \u201cWell now, don\u2019t you clean up nicely? You look very handsome,\u201d Gram continued brightly. Elijah stepped past her to Becca\u2019s side. Elijah had always just thought of Becca as his bossy sister, but for the first time he realized that she was actually a pretty girl. \u201cYou look nice, Beck,\u201d he said with actual sincerity.\nNext everyone\u2019s attention turned to Dad.\n\u201cYou too Tommy,\u201d Gram said in her most motherly voice.\n\u201cI guess you're old enough that I can take your word for it. Now if you'd just keep your tie straight I wouldn't have to worry about you,\u201d she smiled and adjusted the knot.\n\u201cYou look swell too, mum,\u201d Dad replied.\nAs they walked outside to the car Elijah noticed something peculiar. No one was around. Not a single reporter. No one from the neighborhood! He looked down the driveway, but couldn\u2019t see much past the bushes that stood at the end. Had the fervor over the visions passed this quickly? He had been hoping that the crowd would calm down a little so he could go outside without getting swamped by the press, but surely everyone hadn't lost interest already.\n\u201cDon't get yourself in an uproar yet! Wait 'til we get to the end of the driveway,\u201d Dad exclaimed looking at him through the rear-view mirror.\nAs they backed into the street, Elijah turned and saw a line of cars through the rear window that stretched on for several blocks. Hundreds of people had turned up to see where the \u201cprophet\u201d was going to church. Gram mumbled something about looking like a funeral procession, but Elijah thought it was great. The angel had said to share the vision with anyone that would listen and after church he hoped to have a huge crowd ready to hear it.\nBefore long the procession was pulling into the church parking lot. Elijah had always liked the look of the Methodist church. It was well over one hundred years old. The white wooden clapboard siding was contrasted by the bright red doors, the high stained glass windows, and the tall steeple that held the church bell. Its colonial rectangular shape gave it a feel of the pioneer days, when the members of the congregation did the work by hand, without all of the high tech equipment used today. It was a testament to the faith of those who built it.\nThey were cutting the time close. The drive had taken longer than expected, due to detour around a crowded intersection, where another grouping of cars had assembled to follow the \u201cprophet\u201d to church. Most of the regular attendees were passing through the door shaking hands with the greeters as they pulled into the parking lot. Once parked and out of the car, they saw Pastor Mike Moore rush down the steps and hurry towards them, his white robes rustling around him.\nElijah had always liked Pastor Mike, as he insisted the kids at church call him. Physically he didn't really stand out in a crowd. He was average height and weight, dark brown hair, and brown eyes. But it wasn't how Pastor Mike looked that made him different; there was just something about him that was fun to be around.\nEven though they didn\u2019t come to church often, Pastor Mike always remembered Elijah and Becca\u2019s names. He had a special bond with Becca particularly. Pastor Mike had followed in his father and grandfather's footsteps and entered the clergy. Preaching here was his first assignment after graduating from seminary and Becca had been his first baptism. He said he was nervous having seen so many babies burst into tears when the water touched them, but Becca just looked up at him like a little angel. When she was young he used to refer to her as his little cherub.\nPastor Mike escorted them up the steps to the chapel and through the large red double doors. It took a moment for their eyes to adjust from the bright outside to the darker hall. The morning sunlight was shining through the stained glass windows that lined the chapel walls, illuminating with color the tiny speaks of dust that floated in the air. Gram had always said that the stained glass was her favorite part of coming to church and for the first time Elijah realized why. It gave the whole place a more holy feel.\nHe smiled and quickly moved behind the podium. \u201cBrothers and Sisters, Please find a seat as best you can. All my Greeter\u2019s, please do the best you can to help accommodate everyone,\u201d Pastor Mike besseched into the microphone. Soon there was standing room only and it appeared there was still quite a crowd outside of the building.\nPastor Mike motioned for someone in the crowd and soon a man in a similar clergy robe stood beside him. Several minutes passed as the pastor instructed and the man nodded back. Then the man turned and started to make his way back through the crowd.\nThe Abbots had managed to make their way through the crowd to the front pew and were able to squeeze in beside Naomi Moore, Pastor Mike's wife, and their three children, the eldest of which was Jonathan. Although Jonathan and Elijah were in the same grade, they barely knew each other. They only shared one class, Science, and Jonathan sat on the other side of the room. Also, Jonathan had attended a Christian elementary school. After entering the public school system in seventh grade, Jonathan continued to hang around with the kids from the Christian school.\nElijah gave a nervous smile and nod to Jonathan and sat down between Gram and his father. Jonathan smiled and nodded back. Pastor Mike had stepped down from the podium and was walking back towards the front pew. He knelt down in front of Elijah and put his hand on his knee.\n\u201cElijah, I don't mean to put you on the spot, but I was hoping that you might recite your vision to the congregation? That is if it's all right with your dad and grandmother?\u201d Pastor Mike asked looking over at the two of them.\nAs Pastor Mike rose and returned to the podium a feeling of excitement coursed through Elijah. He knew the Lord would open a door for him to speak here. The best part of it was these people were here to listen to the word of God. It wasn't like talking to reporters or at school where there was a mixture of believers and skeptics. These were believers.\n\u201cWell, you've been wishing for a crowd to speak to. Looks like you\u2019re gonna to get your wish, buddy,\u201d Dad said as he peered over his shoulder at the mass of people.\nAs Pastor Mike approached the stand, the people inside instantly grew quiet.\nEven without looking, Elijah was keenly aware that everyone was staring at him as he stood and walked to the stand. Slowly he made his way up the three steps to the podium. Pastor Mike smiled reassuringly and stepped back to allow Elijah access to the microphone. It wasn't until he turned around and looked over the congregation that he realized just how many people were there.\nSchool. It seemed like forever since he was last there. That was his first opportunity to share the vision with a large crowd. At least it seemed like a large crowd then, but it paled in comparison to the huge one before him now. How had he started talking to them? He remembered the feeling he had when the Spirit whispered, \u201cTell them why you\u2019re here.\u201d The thought of that moment instilled Elijah with confidence. The same feeling swelled in him again. He looked at Gram, smiled, and began to speak.\nTime seem to stand still and after what seemed like only a few minutes Elijah had recounted the vision in full. The blood throbbing in his ears died down right after he finished speaking, allowing him to hear the many \u201cAmens\u201d shouted out from the congregation. Seizing the opportunity, Elijah stepped away from the podium to return to his family.\nAs he began to turn away a voice cried out from the crowd, \u201cWhat's it all mean?\u201d Several others also shouted similar pleas.\n\u201cIs Jesus coming soon?\u201d came a woman's voice from the left.\n\u201cWhat about the rapture?\u201d yelled a man from the back.\n\u201cWhat about the rapture? Does this mean it won't happen?\u201d came the man's voice again.\nElijah paused. \u201cWhat's a rapture?\u201d he thought. He felt his face start to go red, embarrassed at not knowing. His mind went blank; unsure of how to answer a question he knew nothing about.\nThere was complete silence throughout the chapel. Elijah could feel every eye boring into him. Even after the vision he didn\u2019t feel much like a \u201cprophet,\u201d and certainly not someone with the ability to heal the sick. And what if he couldn\u2019t heal? What would that mean? Overwhelmed and unsure if he should try to fulfill the request, Elijah prayed.\n\u201cDear Lord, please guide me! I don\u2019t know what to do. You\u2019ve helped me out so far and I need you now more than ever.\u201d Elijah tried to clear his mind, hoping to hear some divine guidance. Still there was only silence. Only seconds had passed, but to Elijah it felt like an eternity. \u201cShould I try to heal this girl? Am I able? Please tell me something, send me a message,\u201d he thought.\nElijah was startled as he felt a hand touch his shoulder. He turned to see Pastor Mike looking at him with a reassuring smile on his face. Pastor Mike gently moved him to the side and stepped to the podium."
