    "text": "Watching the burning woods while it\u2019s below freezing outside is the perfect picture of a winter day. Cold days are for staying cozy at home and reading a book. But you are in 2 minds about completing this picture. I know why.\nDon\u2019t worry the modern wood burning stoves are eco-friendly. They will not increase your carbon footprint. That said, they will also increase the beauty of your house. The stoves these days are designed specifically to complement all types of interiors.\nThe design and size are not the only things to look for in a wood burning stove. The best wood burning stove has a lot of features like the efficiency of burning wood, durability, BTU generated, ease of use and even the wood size it uses. Keeping in mind all these parameters, I have come up with a list of best-performing wood stoves.\nWill you find the one for you?\nFinding the stove that does its job perfectly, is affordable, made of durable material and also looks like a contemporary piece of furniture is a difficult task. These below given 5 fulfill the majority of the requirements and all the basic requirements.\nPleasant Hearth has been known to make distinct and durable models all over the world. When it comes to wood burning stoves, they have set the bar too high. The company provides stoves that heat the entire area evenly and the warmth lasts a lot longer than expected.\n\u2022\tHeating capacity: 1200 sq. Ft.\nThe WS-2417 is a direct vent wood burning stove. This feature makes the chimney too important. Not just as a design feature but also as an installation necessity. The size of the stove is compact and cute; hence the chimney becomes noticeable. But apart from that, while installation also it must be given proper attention because the temperature of the chimney can go up to 2000F when the stove is burning. So if the chimney is not installed correctly, you may experience creosote fire. I would suggest getting it installed by a professional.\nThe stove comes with a brick-lined firebox which will extend the lifespan of the stove and also improve its efficiency. One more advantage is that the bricks maintain the heat inside the stove even after the woods are all burned out. And the stove impressively maintains the room temperature for quite a long time.\nOne more impressive feature of this stove is the ash lip. The stainless steel ash lip makes the cleaning part so simple and improves the functionality of the stove. No litter, only disposal. The stove also has a chrome spring handle for easy movement. Of course, you are not supposed to move it frequently, but when the time comes, it becomes really easy.\nThe design of this stove this awesome. It looks like a conventional one and is black and sturdy. So whatever your d\u00e9cor is, traditional or modern, it will gel in like wallpaper. It has a good height for proper air circulation in the room.\nThe ceramic glass window not only looks good but also serves as a heating appliance. The burning efficiency of the stove is also too good. It has been rated at 85% by EPA.\nNow, that is really awesome!\nThe stove is made from the most ideal material, steel. It will not rust and stay as it is for years to come. Of course, a lot of it depends on how you maintain it. It can heat an area of 1200 square feet very easily. And it can withstand high temperatures, so it will easily work efficiently for next 50 years to come.\nBut for that, you will need to keep checking the door latch and glass assembles for leakage every week. After every use, remove the ashes, clean the lip and check the bricks for cracks or crumbles. Replace the ones that are damaged. And do keep a check on the chimney system, the blower, and the baffles at regular intervals. Vacuum whenever needed.\nHeating your home will no more be a headache if you opt for this one. It has a high heating capacity which makes it the ideal solution for heating your house. I believe it is going to exceed your expectations. The performance sure did exceed mine!\nFor everything else, there\u2019s a 5-year warranty.\nThis is a large stove. The picture says otherwise?\nWell, not big in size, big in performance. Once you try this, your search will end then and there. For me, it was love at first sight. Imagine heating your 2400 square feet room for 10 hours without refuelling.\nFell in love? Well, here\u2019s more!\n\u2022\tHeating capacity: 2400 sq. Ft.\nThe HT2000 has a ceramic glass window so that you can be warm and cozy while watching the hypnotic flames crackle. Though it is a basic design nowadays, I love it. Plus, the heat effect is also awesome because of the glass. The glass is protected by a cast-iron frame which is sturdy and keeps the door in shape.\nThe firebox in this one is amazing. It is big. So big that you can accommodate logs of 22-inch size in it comfortably. That is the reason it can go up to 10 hours without refueling. It has a huge capacity. The heat retention is also due to the brick lining which absorbs the heat and keeps the room warm even after logs are all burned out.\nOne creative feature of this stove is the blower at the back. That was a great idea. It distributes the heat trapped behind the stove and the radiation power of the stove also increases.\nIt has been designed in such a way that you can keep it inside a masonry chimney or outside near a wall in your room. Because it is larger in size and has a reach of 2400 square feet, it will not fit in any home. It needs a large space.\nThe vent of the stove is versatile. You can attach it to the factory built chimney or the masonry one. Works fine with both. It is large but conserves space wherever possible.\nThe stove is large but for efficiency and durability of the stove, do not use logs with a diameterof more than 6 inches. Or else, split them before putting in. the efficiency of the stove has been rated at 78% by EPA, but it will be affected if you put in logs that are too big or not dried properly.\nThe stove is made of strong steel which is a good conductor of heat. So, it will be heating your home for decades without corrosion, or discoloration. With its cast \u2013 iron door and 6/6 inch steel top, it is the sturdiest it can be.\nWith the use of right quality wood, the efficiency of the stove can be maintained for years. The firebox needs to be cleaned after every 2 or 3 days of full usage. Also before refueling, allow the existing wood to burn down completely and let the room temperature come down a little. This will keep off the heat surge.\nFor big house owner, this stove is perfect. With good EPA ratings and 95000 BTU heating capacity, you will not have to worry about the cold nights at all. If you are not putting it in a masonry chimney, keep your hands off the stove. Or else you will be lying in an emergency with second-degree burns.\nThis is one exciting piece of metal. It is the best outdoor wood stove I have ever come across. What I love about it is the simplicity and the concentration on doing its job well. For a hunting tent or a shop, this one is the ideal choice.\nThis is a simple stove with a very heavy door which is a little difficult to latch on. It is made for small places like a tent and is able to provide uniform heat to an area of 350 square feet shop very easily. Many shop owners prefer to keep this in their workshop. And it never disappoints.\nThe chimney comes in 5 parts but once assembled, it has a height of 6 feet which is more than enough for a tent. It can easily be accommodated in a hunting tent, it does not take up much space and the height is just ideal.\nBecause it made for outdoors, it is portable. It is light in weight and be carried around wherever you want to go. From your backyard tent party to a campsite, you can be as creative as you want.\nEverything is detachable and all the parts will fit inside the stove easily. You can load it in your truck and take it anywhere you want. One more interesting feature of this stove is that the body serves as a grate. You can cook food on top of the surface by keeping a pot, a skillet or even a pan. It will also keep your coffee warm.\nCooking grates inside the stove will make it big, which is not ideal for portability and small spaces like a tent. So this stove serves the dual purpose without compromising on compact design.\nThe Guide Gear Outdoor Wood Stove has been designed to fool people. It looks compact and sleek. Made of black galvanized steel it is very attractive. In fact, just because of the design, many people think that it can be used in their house too. But be assured, it is strictly for outdoor usage. It is not EPA approved and is not actually a wood burning stove. So it does not have a clean fire.\nIt is not fit for indoor installation. It needs proper ventilation. Through the ventilation, the stove lets you control the heat. There are air holes which you can open and close according to your heat requirements. Thus you can control the fire inside.\nThe pipe vent is also very nicely built. For movement, it is not a single pipe, but don\u2019t worry it will not leak smoke. The construction is pretty accurate.

It is versatile and can suit many different applications easily. in my opinion, this outdoor stove is a perfectly safe choice.\nJust in case you want a variety of the affordable outdoor stove, here is one another great stove. Though there is not much difference between the two. Kotulas Outdoor Wood Burning Stove is almost similar to the Guide Gear one. How? Look below.\nThe stove is completely portable. Even storage does not take up space. You can take apart the legs and the chimney which comes in 5 parts and fit them all inside the wood burning unit.

It ensures greater output for every burn and very less emission for a greener and a cleaner environment. It uses less fuel and produces more heat, thus wood usage is minimal. It helps in saving the environment in every way it can.\nThe flue outlet can be fixed either at the rear end or at the top which gives you options according to the space you have.

It is small and compact and does not take up much space.

Also, keep checking your chimney and chimney connection for creosote. It is better to avoid chimney fire.\nYou need to keep checking your glass and bricks for cracks or chips. It is not safe on either of them. And of course, the door sealing. Don\u2019t take smoke leakage lightly. Use a soft, non-abrasive cloth to clean the glass and a damp cloth to lean the surface.\nThe 5.\tHi-Flame HF905Uworks as amazingly as it looks. Its capacity to produce clean burns belongs to the top class stoves. Considering that this is a small and affordable option, I honestly did not expect to find the advanced technology on this one. I have found it to be awesome on every level.\nFinding your best match is a difficult task. It needs ticking a lot of checkboxes. But trust me, don\u2019t go for 100% tick marks. Because there will always be something that will be absent on a stove. Your dream stove is not impossible to find. You just have to believe in reality. The stove that tick marks majority boxes are the one for you. Of course, you need to have the heating capacity, efficiency, and durability as your top 3.\nGood quality is very important because I believe heating your family is as important as feeding them."
