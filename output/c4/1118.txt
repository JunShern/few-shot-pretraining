It is also possible to open or close the menu by clicking on a button, and to swipe the menu to close it.\nIf opened is true (false by default), the drawer is initialized in its opened state.\nIf swipe is true (default), the user can swipe to open or close the drawer.\nIf present, function onclose is called just after the drawer is closed, and function onopen just before it starts opening.\nwrap_close and wrap_open can be used to customize calls to close and open_ functions when the drawer closing or opening is triggered. For example, drawer closing can be disabled using wrap_close."
