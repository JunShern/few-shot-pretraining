    "text": "Mar. 18, 2015 5:00 p.m.\nDo you know where sick, injured and orphaned wildlife can get help in your community? BC SPCA Wild Animal Rehabilitation Centre (Wild ARC) helps distressed wild animals get back on their paws, claws and wings all year long, but there\u2019s only one time of year when community members can get a behind-the-scenes glimpse at wildlife rehabilitation in action.\nWild ARC\u2019s Open House will take place between noon and 4 p.m. on March 28 and March 29 \u2013 tour reservations are required, visit spca.bc.ca/tourwildarc2015 to reserve. There is no charge for this family friendly event, but gifts of food and supplies to help care for the animals are much appreciated and a wish list is provided with registration. Wild ARC is located at 1020 Malloch Road in Metchosin. Only 1,000 guests can be accommodated during the two-day event, so reserve a spot today.\nCouncil has passed a motion to implement Bylaw 293, Animal Regulation and Impounding, that prohibits the active feeding of wildlife within the District of Sooke. The bylaw aims to discourage Sooke residents from providing a consistent source of food to wild animals such as deer, rabbits and squirrels as it disrupts as their natural feeding habits. The inclusion of small wildlife near residential areas also attracts bigger predators such as bears and cougars.\nThe Sooke Core Sewer Specified Area Bylaw 2003 has been approved by council to enlarge the community sewer system service area to include a parcel of land located at 7120 West Coast Road. The new property owner will pay $2,800 hook-up fee for the sewer system\u2019s extension.\nCouncil has carried the motion to review the Sooke River Road parking lot and look into options that will improve access and public safety. One of the suggestions was to get the end of the lot extended.\nSEAPARC and its partners will be celebrating the grand opening of the new Sooke Bike Park and Hike & Bike Connector Trail on March 28 from 12 \u2013 2 p.m.\nThe new bike park and trail creates the opportunity for people to be active and foster a connection with nature.\nThe project was made possible through a $75,000 grant from the CRD through the Active Transportation Innovative infrastructure Funding Program with SEAPARC, the District of Sooke and the Juan de Fuca Electoral Area as participants. SEAPARC committed a further $24,000 to the project.\nWhen complete, the bike park will include a pump track, a circular hard-dirt surface with hills, and trail access that stretches from the end of Throup Road to SEAPARC."
