    "text": "When you\u2019re itching to make your first money as a freelance writer and dying to know how to get writing jobs, it can be tempting to dash out and start applying for every job you can get your hands on, and you\u2019ll probably have some success doing that if you apply for enough of them. But you\u2019ll do far better if you do some planning, preparation and thinking about what you want beforehand.\nEveryone is different and we all have our favourite topics that we like writing about. Before you start applying for jobs, think about what you prefer to write. The whole idea of working for yourself is that you can be the one to pick and choose, without having a boss deciding for you. Why spend your time writing finance blogs, for example, if it bores you to death?\nNext, think about what types of writing you like to do. Do you want to be a ghostwriter for celebrities or fiction authors? Is blogging your area of expertise or do you prefer content marketing?\nWhat type of clients do you want to work with? Corporate giants, small businesses, start-ups, digital agencies?\nWhatever your preference, narrowing down your favourite writing types, clients and topics allows you to target your marketing and find jobs that are much closer to what you want.\nNext, you need to take a look at your author website, your portfolio, and your presence on social media.\n\u2022 If you were your potential client, would you be impressed by your website?\n\u2022 Does your site attract the kind of clients you\u2019re looking for?\n\u2022 Is your site SEO optimised to rank in the search engines for your keywords?\n\u2022 Is your blog up to date, well-written and consistent?\n\u2022 Do you post great content regularly on social media?\n\u2022 Is your portfolio professionally presented, up to date and reflective of you as a writer?\nWhile you don\u2019t have to have everything perfect, and you can and should market to clients with what you have right now, these are some of the things to work on and constantly improve over time to attract more targeted and higher paying clients.\nYou can find writing jobs that go up to thousands of pounds for one project. But you can also find jobs that pay less than one pence a word. You might find that your success comes down to two things: experience and confidence. While it pays to have a portfolio behind you to show a client what you\u2019re capable of, being able to sell yourself confidently can go a long way to securing you higher paid jobs, even if you have less experience.\nIf you know your worth, don\u2019t just settle for any old job at any price. Look for jobs that pay the rate you want and which align with your skills, knowledge and interests and aim for those. Having a specialist background in one subject or niche industry can actually help command better fees.\nRemember, you need to eat and pay bills, and you deserve to earn enough to actually have a life too. Sometimes it can be a balancing act, and as a writer you\u2019ll notice that there can be times when you have jobs piling up and others when the inbox is dry.\nHowever, when you stand back and look at it from time to time, your copywriting career should be showing real progression; if you spend too much energy searching for lots of low-paid jobs, you\u2019ll never make it big. So regularly review your salary goals and take steps to achieve them.\nOn job boards and when writing for publications, you\u2019ll quite often find that the projects advertised are fixed rate \u2013 either so much per project or so much per word, so it\u2019s much easier to see if they pay the rate you\u2019d like.\nIf you write for businesses, however, you need to have some idea that they have the budget to hire you before you spend hours crafting the perfect, targeted Letter of Introduction (LOI).\nHow do you know? Check out their annual revenue. If it\u2019s in the millions, chances are they can afford to hire you. Where will you find that information? If they are a limited company, which with that sort of turnover they probably are, then you can search on Companies House, or try Company Check, which has a free version and paid plans starting at only \u00a350 per year. Company Check will also tell you if they\u2019ve had any CCJs and what their risk score is, so you have more of an idea if you\u2019re going to get paid.\nLook at their website, read their blog and see what sort of company they are. If it\u2019s obvious they have a similar approach and tone to you, there\u2019s a good possibility you\u2019ll click and enjoy the working relationship.\nAlso, check how long your prospective company has been in business. If they\u2019ve been around a while, there\u2019s a great chance they understand the value of marketing and good writing and are likely to have opportunities for you.\nWhen you apply for jobs on any of these sites, make sure you read the job listing carefully, and follow the instructions for how to apply.\nYou\u2019d be amazed how many people don\u2019t do this basic step, and you\u2019ll put yourself ahead of the pack if you do!\nWhile approaching businesses direct will likely get you higher rates as there\u2019s no middle man, there are plenty of agencies that are likely to either work with freelancers or hire them to produce copy for their clients.\nTry digital marketing agencies, website development companies, graphic designers, and printing companies.\nThe advantage of approaching agencies is that they already have the clients, and you don\u2019t have to go and find them yourself.\nTry networking with them on social media, commenting on their blog, and building up a relationship with them first, then you\u2019re not sending a cold pitch, you\u2019re sending a warm pitch from someone that they are familiar with.\nMany businesses need freelance writers for everything from website copy, email marketing and product descriptions to case studies, white papers, and even technical manuals.\nYou can use the same approach as with agencies by networking so you can send a warm pitch, or pick up the phone and have a chat if you\u2019re comfortable doing that. The worst you\u2019ll get is a \u2018no thank you\u2019, and you might find you get a great response.\nA lot of companies are so busy that they don\u2019t have time to advertise for a freelance writer, so if you pop up with your well-crafted writer\u2019s website and your excellent experience in their field, you could be just what they were looking for.\nDid you know LinkedIn has a jobs section? You don\u2019t have to spend hours poring over it either. Just sign up for alerts for the type of jobs you are looking for, and they will email them to you."
