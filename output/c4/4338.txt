    "text": "It\u2019s a simple fact at this point: Social media is a part of our daily lives. From showing our vacation adventures to sharing videos of our pets, social media has become an outlet for each of us to document our life and illustrate who we are as a person. Amid the perfect GIFs and clever captions, social media has also become an easy-access point for future employees to vet potential candidates and for individuals to discover and secure a new job.\nIn fact, 70 percent of employers use social media to screen candidates, and 57% have decided not to hire a candidate based on their social media profiles. With potential job opportunities at stake, it\u2019s important now more than ever for job seekers to use social media to their advantage and show employers who they are, what they can do and where they\u2019re going in life.\nTaking control of your personal brand through social media is the key to securing the attention and appreciation of your future employer. Here are five social media tips to make your profile stand out above the crowd and help you snag that dream job.\nFacebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, and the list of social platforms goes on and on. But the key to social media is to have quality accounts that you enjoy updating and show the depth of what you can do. Depending on your area of specialty, some social media sites may be more appropriate than others. For aspiring journalists, Twitter may be the platform of choice, while graphic artists might flock to Tumblr.\nKeep in mind that it\u2019s better to have two up-to-date accounts that demonstrate what you\u2019re all about than five accounts that haven\u2019t been updated in years. Your social accounts are not a dumping ground for things of the past; they are a window into what makes your soul tick.\nWe tend to think of social media as a substitute for real-life interactions. But if you want to outshine other job candidates, consider using your social media accounts to connect with industry experts and mentors in real life.\nSend a personalized message to that LinkedIn connection you just made and see if he or she wants to chat and have coffee. Talk to that old college friend who\u2019s rocking it in the industry you want to be a part of. At a special conference for your field? Use the conference Twitter hashtag to network and connect with folks later in the day. Going the extra mile to connect with folks will make you stick out in their minds when any future opportunities do arise!\nOnce you establish your voice and expertise, share trends you\u2019re noticing in the field and back up your thoughts with articles and current projects. Be careful not to simply brag about your accomplishments though, be approachable and share other leaders\u2019 successes and viewpoints. Your followers (and future employer) will appreciate your dedication to the topics that matter to you and your willingness to share the knowledge you\u2019ve gained with others.\nEmployers not only use social media to learn more about potential candidates, they also use social profiles to see if the candidate fits the company\u2019s culture and would work well with current employees. Don\u2019t be afraid show off your personality, and remember, it\u2019s perfectly fine to be quirky and fun! By letting the real you shine through, employers will be able to imagine how you would fit within their company and hopefully you can find the exact work environment you are looking for.\nJust because you\u2019re getting older doesn\u2019t mean you have to stop learning. Follow industry groups on LinkedIn, create lists on topics you want to learn more about on Twitter, attend conferences or events and go live so others can see what you\u2019re up to. Employers will be impressed by your determination to learn all you can. Plus, if you don\u2019t seem to have everything on paper that they\u2019re looking for, employers will be able to see how you\u2018re constantly educating yourself and adapting to the changing landscape. Who wouldn\u2019t want to hire someone like that?\nNow take these five tips to heart, and you\u2019ll be well on your way to securing that special role. Happy job hunting!\nYour information about Tips for Job Hunters is very well.Thank you for providing information."
