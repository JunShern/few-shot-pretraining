    "text": "Cancer is considered to be one of the most notorious types of disease that have been destroying the lives of individuals and families alike for decades. Mesothelioma is no different. While there is no known cure at the moment for this type of aggressive cancer, mesothelioma patients can undergo treatments such as chemotherapy, surgery, immunotherapy, and radiation therapy to relieve symptoms and reduce suffering. In case such conventional therapies don\u2019t work, another option is to participate in experimental treatments through clinical trials. Considering that, we can conclude that getting treatment for mesothelioma may cost the patient an arm and a leg.\nIf you are an ordinary working individual diagnosed with mesothelioma and are worried whether or not you can afford to pay your medical bills, how can you get the financial claim? Read on and find out.\nA quick search on Wikipedia will tell you that malignant mesothelioma is a rare and deadly form of cancer which commonly affects the lining of the lungs, heart, and abdomen area, known as the mesothelium. Made up of specialized cells called mesothelial cells, the mesothelium is essential to the body because it serves as a thin layer of tissue covering the internal organs\u2019 outer surface. The mesothelium is also responsible for producing a certain type of lubricating fluid that allows the body\u2019s internal organs to move freely opposite each other.\nAsbestos, a naturally occurring type of silicate mineral mostly used by commercial and industrial companies for construction, is identified by medical researchers to be the primary culprit behind mesothelioma. The disease is contracted by either inhaling or ingesting asbestos fibers, which in turn get lodged in the linings of the internal organs and mutate normal cells into cancer cells. The most vulnerable people are those known to have worked directly with asbestos or were involved in manufacturing products that contain asbestos. These include construction workers, factory workers, railroad and automotive industry workers, asbestos miners, people who worked in shipyards, insulation builders, plumbers, veterans, and even the family members of those exposed to asbestos. People who live in or near places where asbestos is present are also at high-risk of acquiring this malignant cancer.\nWhat most sufferers of mesothelioma don\u2019t know is that if their employer deliberately exposed their workers to asbestos, or failed to prepare or secure them from exposure to this cancer-causing mineral, they can file a case called asbestos lawsuit. The lawsuit holds the employer or entity legally accountable for the injuries and damages to the person exposed to asbestos. To be able to file a lawsuit case, the affected person must be able to prove that they suffer from injuries related to asbestos exposure, such as mesothelioma.\nIf you, a loved one or a friend suffer from mesothelioma and believe that you contracted the disease at work, you may be eligible to get a financial claim if you file a lawsuit and win the case against your employer for causing personal injury.
