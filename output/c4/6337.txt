    "text": "There are so many Our Generation friends to choose from. Each doll has their own personality and style, and enjoys different hobbies (accessory sets available). OG dolls are available in a variety of hair colours, skin tones, eye colour and ethnicities. You can choose a doll to resemble the child the gift is for, or simply allow them to pick their favourite.\nNew for 2017 is Blanca the Scientist (from the Professional OG range). A girl with ambition! She has dark hair styled in bunches and brown eyes (that open). OG describe Blanca as Hispanic and she has a darker skin tone. Blanca wears glasses. Standing at 18\" (46cm) tall, Blanca is a regular OG girl which means she has a soft body with hard vinyl hands, legs and feet. She is described as non-pose-able, her fixed limbs mean she can stand up and be displayed. Blanca wears her lab coat, a purple skirt, shirt, cosmic themed bow tie, long socks and boots. Accessories include steampunk goggles, glasses, a wind up walking robot, calliper, atom model, pencil and robot spec sheet.\nThis is a nice quality doll with a friendly appealing face. She is soft in her body so can be taken to bed at night for a cuddle, but her hard limbs mean she can also stand up on her own feet. She makes a great role model for budding scientists. We think it is important that children can choose a doll that looks like them - and OG dolls come in so many different varieties there is a likeness for most children. Deluxe Our Generation Dolls and accessories are also available.\nOur Generation is the British version of American Girl. A lot cheaper than flying over to the good old USA to fulfil your daughter's wishlist. The hobbies available from the accessory sets offer a good range of pursuits, from swimming, to fishing, to riding to football. OG girls definitely can! Packaging is made from recycled materials, is 100% recyclable and is printed with soy-based inks. For every Our Generation doll, outfit or accessory you buy, a portion of sales goes to Free The Children's Power of a Girl Initiative to help provide girls in developing countries an education."
