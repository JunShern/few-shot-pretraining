    "text": "Over the last few days we\u2019ve been quite surprisingly excited about getting some hands on time with the latest cycling mega title (this is a thing now, apparently) Le Tour De France 16. Being exercise avoiders and salad dodgers for quite some time now, it\u2019s a title which we went into without really knowing what to expect, but we\u2019ve come away fairly impressed and will definitely be sinking some more time into it very soon.\nYou may be imagining (as we were) that this title would be mostly about mashing your controller in a constant and concerted effort to retain the number one spot and hurtle your way through the stages of Le Tour, but this couldn\u2019t be further form the game we\u2019re presented with. Instead, fine strategy management is required for both your own stamina and your team\u2019s efforts as well, to ensure a good finish for you at the end of each stage.\nIt\u2019s a lot more in depth than we thought it would be, and for non-cycling enthusiasts, we\u2019ve liked the detail and strategy which has been put into this, as well as the relaxing nature of the ride. While we\u2019ve had an enjoyable (if sometimes a little baffling) experience, We imagine that this will be a hit for fans of the sport.\nSatisfaction: 7/10: It\u2019s not a super high score but it\u2019s definitely one we\u2019ve enjoyed playing. While there\u2019s nothing outstanding for us, we imagine that fans of Le tour or cycling in general may get a lot more out of the game though, and at \u00a339.99, or 49.99 for the US and Europe, it\u2019s not pricing itself out of the market.\nAs ever our Parent\u2019s Guide above goes through all of the PEGI ratings and review elements, and don\u2019t forget to Subscribe to keep up with all our News, Reviews, and Flashbacks."
