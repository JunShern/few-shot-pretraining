We will not remove from back yards.\nWe will run an industrial magnet to remove nails and other metal debris from the pick up area before we leave.\nWe will tear down and remove any type of fence, wall, deck, or similar structure.\nWe have fully insured, professional crews.\nWe provide free written estimates.\nFees are based on type of fence to be removed and any additional services such as concrete tear out, post pulling, tree removal, etc."
