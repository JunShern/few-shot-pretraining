    "text": "ROMANS 8:38 KJV \"For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things...\"\n35Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? 36As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. 37Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. 38For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, 39Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.\n8:38 I am persuaded - This is inferred from the thirty - fourth verse, in an admirable order: - Neither death shall hurt us; For Christ is dead: Nor life; 'is risen Nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers; nor things pre - sent, nor things to come; is at the right hand of God: Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature; maketh intercession for us. Neither death - Terrible as it is to natural men; a violent death in particular, #Rom 8:36|. Nor life - With all the affliction and distress it can bring, #Rom 8:35|; or a long, easy life; or all living men. Nor angels - Whether good (if it were possible they should attempt it) or bad, with all their wisdom and strength. Nor principalities, nor powers - Not even those of the highest rank, or the most eminent power. Nor things present - Which may befal us during our pilgrimage; or the whole world, till it passeth away. Nor things to come - Which may occur either when our time on earth is past, or when time itself is at an end, as the final judgment, the general conflagration, the everlasting fire. Nor height, nor depth - The former sentence respected the differences of times; this, the differences of places. How many great and various things are contained in these words, we do not, need not, cannot know yet. The height - In St. Paul's sublime style, is put for heaven. The depth - For the great abyss: that is, neither the heights, I will not say of walls, mountains, seas, but, of heaven itself, can move us; nor the abyss itself, the very thought of which might astonish the boldest creature. Nor any creature - Nothing beneath the Almighty; visible enemies he does not even deign to name. Shall be able - Either by force, #Rom 8:35|; or by any legal claim, #Rom 8:33|, &c. To separate us from the love of God in Christ - Which will surely save, protect, deliver us who believe in, and through, and from, them all.\nRo 8:38 For I am persuaded. No hostile power of the universe can lead us away, is the apostle's holy confidence. That neither death nor life. These adversaries seem to advance in pairs. Death is named first, because death by martyrdom threatens. The next pair is nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers. \"The angels\" are good angels, while malignant angels are meant by the other terms. Nor things present, nor things to come. The present or the future.\nYes , I am persuaded : This is an individual belief and stand : Nothing : Nothing shall separate me from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus : Praise God !!!!\nWhen the love of God is in the heart of a man deeply nothing can prevent that individual from serving God faithfully.\nGod 's love for us does not depend on anything that we do. He loves us in spite of not because of. God is not always pleased with what we do but we can be assured he will always love us.\nFor I am persuaded: this is an individual matter... Each child of God must come to that place that they know without a shadow of a doubt that the Almighty God is with them. This passage are for those who have sold out to the world, and have put all their trust in Jesus - so sure that no matter what comes out against them - the many fiery darts of the advesary, the devil, or the seemingly endless trials - God's people are unwavering as Paul. They know no matter what, God is with them and will love them forever. But this is solely for those who Jesus and have come to the place of the knowledge of the truth. Not so for the wicked.\nI made up my mind, that no force will be forceful enough to separate me from the love of God which is expressly demonstrated in our Lord Jesus."
