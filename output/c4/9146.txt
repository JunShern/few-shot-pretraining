He said: \"I am sure the investigation will get opened again in due course.\"\nWhen Madeleine disappeared on 3 May, 2007, it launched a media frenzy which continues to this day.\nHowever, the sad anniversary also serves to highlight the number of families in the UK looking for their lost children. More than 230,000 missing children reports are made in the UK every year. Although the majority are later found, hundreds are thought to disappear without trace.\nA series of events are planned to take place in more than 18 countries on International Missing Children's Day - 25 May - to highlight the scale of the problem.\nIBTimes UK looks at some of the children for whom the search continues. For more information on the missing children, visit the Missing People charity website."
