    "text": "Dr. Shamim A. Imam, M.D.\nDr. Shamim Imam has been living in northern Virginia for over thirty years with her husband and three children. Dr. Imam completed her family medicine residency in Virginia in 1991 and established her solo practice. She has been committed to providing quality care since then.\nDr. Imam's philosophy is to serve as a coach, teacher, and role model for her patients. She ensures her patients' satisfaction and comfort by carefully listening to their needs and providing thorough patient education. Dr. Imam keeps current with the latest technology and progress in medicine as a member of many prestigious academies.\nWhat are our patient's saying?\n\"Dr. Imam is a wonderful doctor. The waiting time was short and the office welcomed walk-ins. Dr. Imam has helped me a lot through the years and I am extremely grateful for the care and time she puts into her job.\"\n\"I have just started going to Dulles Family Medicine and found that the service is really good. Her service was quick and professional, and she was funny, and the office staff was helpful. The medicine she prescribed worked great.\"\n\"EXCELLENT DOCTOR! I have been going to Dr. Imam for a little over a year now and I must say she is one of the most helpful, resourceful, and knowledgeable doctors out there. She was very caring and straight to the point with me when I came to her office for the first time with my health problems. She only wants what's best for you and will help you get better in no time with her precise diagnoses. The office staff was also very pleasant and helpful as well. I would highly recommend Dr. Imam to anyone needing a good doctor.\n\"Excellent practice with very professional bilingual staff. Doctor was very knowledgeable and kind and funny in a cheesy way. Wait time was much better compared to other family practices I have been too in the past in the Herndon/Reston area. I am a frequent flier in the clinic (due to a long list of medical problems) and have experienced other family practices for the past 10 years in the Herndon/Reston area and Dr. Imam is by far the best. I have been going to Dr.Imam for over 2 years now I plan on staying here. I also bring my children here. I would absolutely recommend her to other family and friends. Office is very clean and ample parking space.\"\n\"Dr. Imam is professional and thorough; I have been seeing her for about a year now. She has been very good about diagnosing my issues and prescribing me the right kinds of medication and ensuring that there is the appropriate follow-up. The office waits can range from several minutes to 10-30 minutes when she is busy. It is worth the wait. I will continue to see Dr. Imam in the future and be relieved that she is the one looking after my health. \""
