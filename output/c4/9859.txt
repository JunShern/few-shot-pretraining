    "text": "A post a bit like an\u2026 article to be frank.\nThis week I\u2019ve been moping around the house feeling really ill. I was very weak so I slipped out of my normal skin-care routine. I avoided the mirror I case I had broken out in disgusting spots or blackheads. But to my supprise, when I faced my reflection I was greeted with a clear(ish) face which seemed (confusingly) healthy. This is definitely a rare occasion for me because even at my best you can still find a few little blemishes on my T-Zone and it always seems slightly tired, but for some reason I have had better skin than I\u2019ve had for a very long time.\nThe illness definately wasn\u2019t causing it, so that could be ticked off. Then there was the considerably minimal amount of sugary folds I was eating, the betrayal of my skin care routine and the increase in sleep I was getting. So I\u2019ve decided to set myself a challenge.\nThere is no way I want to return to my horrible teen complexion so I am going to make sure I change my old routines and habits to benifit my skin. So I am going to pick out the main things I think may have helped clear my skin, and try my hardest to stick to tweek for two weeks, updating the blog letting you know of my theory works!\nSo, I have decided I am only allowed one very small sugary thing a day. (This includes limiting biscuits, chocolate, any sweet or toffee, sugary drink or cakes.) There have been many links found between sugar and the effect it has on your skin, and seeing as my skin has improved and I haven\u2019t had anything sugary, I might as well try it!\nI will try to drink a lot more water. My mum was made sure I drank litres and litres of water/squash because your body gets dehydrated when your ill. This could be a factor so I\u2019m adding that too.\nI will eat healthier. I was also eating a large amount of fruit and veg to boost my vitamin levels. This without a doubt helped keep my skin healthy and clear so I\u2019m definitely going to try this.\nI didn\u2019t use any facial cleaner, not even a warm flannel \u2013 just a baby wipe over my face roughly once a day. I\u2019ve done this before when I\u2019ve run out of facial cleansers and I find that normal baby wiped have actually had a real improvement on my skin, probably because its not irritated as much as it is when I use my facial scrubs and cleaners. So for the next two weeks I can only use facial wipes, once a day at a maximum.\nI also had a considerably longer sleep every day, although this is going to be really hard to fit into my day because I have to get up early for school but go to sleep late to make sure I stay on top of homework! So for now I am going to stick to my normal sleeping pattern.\nThere we go! The challenge is set! I have to drink plenty water, eat healthy, cut back on sugary foods, stop using facial cleansers and only use baby wipes when needed! To be honest I\u2019m quite anxious because I\u2019m scared that if the facial cleanser theory is wrong, I\u2019ll break out stop spots which will completely ruin my week! But if any of the others isn\u2019t a factor after all, I\u2019ll stick to it anyway because it will benifit my health anyway!"
