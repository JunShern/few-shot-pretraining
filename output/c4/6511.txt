    "text": "The granary, which is a constituent part of the Mo\u017eina homestead, is located in Zavratec, in the open plateau area at the utmost eastern border of the Municipality of Idrija. Besides the granary, the homestead includes also other buildings: a big one-floor residential house, a barn, a double corn-rack, a chapel, a woodshed and a drying house for fruit. The homestead and its owners are mentioned in numerous documents, as for example cadastres and land registers from 1500 onwards. The granary was built from the autochthon stone grintavec. The one-floored building is covered with a white fa\u00e7ade, and at the edges painted with illustrations (from the start of the 20th century) with knitted edges and a decorated wreath with the so called tufts under the jutting roof. The stone frame of the door boasts the year 1678. Above the arched cellar, which is one big place, which still serves as a place to store produce, is a 3-roomed residential floor, where up to the 1930's families of farm workers ('gosta\u010di') lived as well as a young pair, who was next in line to become in charge of the farm. From the hallway one can access a black kitchen (which is still functional), which was used for drying of meat, baking of bread, etc., as well as the 'house' with the new folk-stove and a table, which are both connected to a small room. The wooden attic, which was used to store hay, is covered by a two-eaves roof with a straw roof sheet. The storage room for grain was located in the main residential building. All the interior is original, maybe only brought from the main house, which is in many cases noted down with a date. The southern fa\u00e7ade has a wooden aisle for drying of produce.\nGranary is today set up as a museum, while its owner, the farmer, allows it to be used for various celebrations (up to 20 people) and workshops (baking of bread, bobbin-work, woollen yarn). The granary also offers home-made dry meat specialities."
