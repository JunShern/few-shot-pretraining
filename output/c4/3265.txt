He was suffering from High Grade Vesicoureteric Reflux .\nNow After Modern Homeopathy\u2018s treatment it is reversed totally with normal Renal Functioning.\nFor more details visit \u201cMODERN HOMEOPATHY\u2026\u2026.it is curative line of homeopathic treatment\u201d.\nPD is a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system. Most of the PD cases are idiopathic (no cause).\nA small proportion of cases can be attributed to known genetic factors.\nOther factors such as environmental toxins, herbicides, pesticides and fungicides have been associated with the risk of developing PD no cause in proven.\nPD is non genetic disorder.\n15% of individuals with PD have a first degree relative who has the disease.\nAt least 5% of people are now known to have forms of the disease that occur because of a mutation of one of severe specific genes.\nPlantations in specific genes have been shown to cause PD.\nThese genes code for alpha-synuclein(SNCA) parkin(PRKN), Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK 2 or dardar in), PTEN- induced putative kinase 1 (PINK 1) DI-1 and ATPI3A2. In most cases, people with these mutations will develop PD. With the exception of LRRK2, they account for only a small minority of cases of PD. The most extensively studied PD related genes are SNCA and LRRK2 and Glucocerebrosidase (GBA) have been found to be risk factors for sporadic PD- Mutatoins in GBA are known to cause Gauchers disease.\nGenome-wise association studies which search for PD mutated alleles with low penetrance in sporadic cases have now yielded many positive results.\nThe role of the SNCA Gene is important in PD because the alpha synuclein protein is the main component of Lewy bodies.\nSNCA is expressed throughout the mammalian brain, and enriched in presynaptic nerve terminals. Missense Mutations of the gene (in which a single nucleoid is changed) and duplications and triplications of the locus containing it have been found in different groups with familial PD.\nMissense mutations in SNCA are rare.\nMultiplications of the SNCA locus account for around 2% of familial cases. Multiplications of the SNCA have been found in asymptomatic carriers, which indicate that penetrance is incomplete or age dependent.\nLevel of alpha synuclein expression correlates with disease onset and progression with SNCA gene triplication advancing earlier and faster than duplication.\nLRRK2 gene (PARK 8) encodes for a protein called dardarin.\nThe name dardarin was taken from a basque word for tremors because this gene was first identified in families from England and the North Spain.\nA significant number of autosomal dominant Parkinsons Disease cases are associated with mutations in the LRRK2 gene.\nMutation in LRRK2 are the most common known cause of familial and sporadic PD, accounting for approximately 5% of the individuals with a family history of the disease.\nThere are many different mutations described in exists for a small number.\nMutations in the PINK 1, PRKN and DJ1 may cause mitochondrial dysfunction an element of both idiopathic and genetic PD.\nOf related interest are mutations in the progranulin gene that have been found to cause corticobasal degeneration seen in dementia.\nThis could be relevant in PD cases associated with dementia.\nMutations in GBA are known to cause Gauchers disease.\nIncidentally both gain of functions and loss of functions GBA mutations are proposed to contribute to Parksinsonism through effects such as increased alpha synulcein level.\nPD is thought to result from a complex interaction between multiple genetic and environmental factors, though rare managerial forms of the disease do exist.\nMutations in 6 genes (SNCA, LRRK2, PRKN, DJ1, Pink1 and ATP13A2) have been shown to cause familial Parksinonsism.\nIn common variation in 3 genes (MAPT, LRRK1 and SNCA) and loss of function mutations in GBA have been well validated.\nParkinsons Disease affects movement, producing motor symptoms, non-motor symptoms, which include autonomic dysfunction, neuro-psychiatric problems (mood, cognition, behavior or thought alterations) and sensory and sleep difficulties are also common.\nThere are four motor symptoms which are considered cardinal in Parkinson\u2019s disease.\nThis symptom is most apparent and well-known in 30% of patient with PD don\u2019t have tremors at disease onset. Most develop it as the disease progresses. It is usually a rest tremor. Maximal when the limb is at rest and disappearing with voluntary movement and sleep.\nIt affects to a greater extent the most Distal pact of the limb and at the onset typically appears in only a single arm or leg, becoming bilateral later. Frequency of PD tremor is between 4-6 hertz cycles per second. Pill rolling tremor the tendency of the index finger of the and to get into contact with the thumb and perform together a circular movement.\nIt is stiffness and resistance to limb movement caused by increased Muscle Tone, excessive and continuous contraction of muscles. Rigidity is uniform (Lead-pipe rigidity) or ratchet (Cogwheel rigidity). The combination f tremor and increased tone is considered to be at the origin of cogwheel rigidity. It may be associated with joint pains, frequent. In the beginning it is asymmetrical rigidity, neck is affected shoulder muscles prior to the muscles of the face and extremities. Rigidity affects the whole body and reduces the ability to move.\nIt is associated with difficulties along the whole course of the movement process, from planning to initiation and finally execution of a movement. Performance of sequential and simultaneous movements is hindered. Bradykinesia is a very disabling symptom in the early stages of the disease. Initial complaints are problems when performing daily tests which require fine motor control like writing, sewing or getting dressed.\nClinical evaluation is based in similar tasks such as alternating movements between both hands or both feet.\nBradykinesia is not equal for all movement or times. It is modified by the action activity or emotional state of the subject, to the point that some people are barely able to walk yet can still ride a bicycle. Generally people with PD have less difficulty when some sort of external cue is provided.\nIt is seen in the last stage of disease, leading to impaired balance and frequent falls, then to bone fractures. Up to 40% may experience falls and around 10% may have falls weekly, with number of falls being related to severity.\nFestinating (rapid shuffling steps and forward flexed pasture when walking, speech, swallowing disturbances, including voice disorder may be seen. Mask like face expression or small handwriting may seen.\nParkinsonism word is used for a motor syndrome. The main symptoms are tremor at rest, stiffness, slowing of movement and postural instability.\nIt means Parkinsonism with no external identifiable cause. In recent years several genes that are directly related to some causes of Parkinson\u2019s Disease have been discovered.\nThe term Familial Parkinson\u2019s Disease and Sporadic Parkinson\u2019s Disease can be used to differentiate genetic from truly idiopathic forms of disease.\nUsually classified as a movement disorder PD also gives rise to many non-motor types of symptoms like sensory deficits, cognitive difficulties or sleep problems.\nParkinson\u2019s Plus Disease are primary Parkinsonism\u2019s which present additional features. They include Multiple System Arophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration and dementia with Lewy Bodies.\nIn terms of pathophysiological part, PD is considered a Synucleiopathy due to abnormal accumulation of alpha synuclein protein in the brain in the form of Lewy Bodies, as opposed to other disease such as Alzheimer\u2019s Disease, where the brain accumulates Tan Protein in the form of Neurofibrollary Tangles.\nThe most typical symptoms of the Alzheimer\u2019s Disease, dementia, occurs in advanced stages of PD, while it is common to find neurofibrillary tungles in brains affected by PD.\nDementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) is another synucleiop that has similarities with PD, and especially with the subsets of PD cases with dementia."
