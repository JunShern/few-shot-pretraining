    "text": "Preserving meat \u2026 sounds like something that could go badly, botulism-riddled wrong, doesn\u2019t it?\nCharcuterie is a a slightly daunting area, and it isn\u2019t an undertaking to be taken lightly. I\u2019m nowhere near ready to cure and air-dry a whole leg of pork, or equipped to maintain the specific temperature or level of humidity suitable for curing salami or pepperoni.\nThere are no dangerously modified fridges around here.\nThere\u2019s a halfway house, though \u2026 there are plenty of charcuterie recipes that you can make that aren\u2019t quite as temperamental as some of the more artisan air-dried produce. The air drying process starts with something raw, and ends, after curing and drying, with something that you can eat without having to cook it any further, something that\u2019s properly preserved and that will keep for months.\nThe halfway house involves curing the meat, then cooking it in some way. Bacon is a perfect example of this method \u2013 cured meat that has a definite shelf life, and obviously needs cooking, until it\u2019s crisp, please.\nHere\u2019s an easy introduction to this particular brand of pseudo charcuterie called tasso ham. It\u2019s a Cajun delicacy, pork shoulder steaks cured quickly, smothered in big seasonings, then smoked until cooked, all achievable with kit that lives in the average shed.\nTasso ham needs one slightly unusual ingredient, but it\u2019s an important one \u2013 pink salt, or Prague powder #1, or Instacure #1, or whatever it\u2019s called these days. It\u2019s essentially sodium nitrite, a chemical that, when mixed with salt, forms a basic curing mix. There\u2019s more about the vital difference between sodium nitrite and sodium nitrate here. If you\u2019re not sure, look for a ready-mixed basic curing mix.\nTo make a basic curing mixture by mixing 450g of salt, 225g of sugar and 50g of pink salt together. That\u2019s it.\nUse the curing mix to cure about 2kg of pork shoulder steaks, big, chunky steaks, if they\u2019re available \u2013 the chunkier the better. Pour the curing mix into a large shallow bowl, and press the pork into the salt, dredging the top until it\u2019s completely covered. Transfer the pieces of pork to another dish, laying them in a single layer, and sprinkle over the rest of the curing mix.\nRefrigerate the pork, and after four hours, rinse it clean under a running tap. It isn\u2019t a long cure, but it\u2019s important. The cure keeps the meat pink, flavours it, preserves it, and turns it into ham.\nSo, pork shoulder, cured and covered in some quite powerful flavours. It just needs cooking, now.\nThis is barbecue territory. It\u2019s possible to hot smoke food in many ways, but the easiest and most accessible way is just to use a normal covered barbecue.\nSet a small fire at one side of the barbecue, near to one of the air vents in the base, and let the charcoal burn down until it\u2019s covered in grey ash. Throw a couple of big handfuls of wood chips onto the coals, set the meat on the racks at the other side of the barbecue and put the lid on. The wood chips will smoke furiously, and the barbecue will quickly fill with light grey, sweet-smelling smoke.\nThe type of wood makes a difference \u2013 I used chips of apple wood I found on the Internet for a couple of quid, and they provided a light, clean taste with a tinge of acidity to it.\nThe meat is ready when it reaches an internal temperature of 65c, or 150f. Use a meat thermometer to check. It\u2019s hard to say how long this will take, but keep the fire tended by adding more wood chips until the meat gets up to temperature.\nTasso ham is never eaten on its own. Instead, it\u2019s a vital ingredient in things like jambalaya, or gumbo, adding a powerful injection of flavour and heat into the dish. It\u2019s also very good finely diced and fried with potatoes, served with a fried egg on top.\nThe ham will keep for a couple of weeks in the fridge, or a couple of months in the freezer.\nfrom the searching I have done online I get the impression that the difference between Prague powders 1 and 2 is the presence of potassium nitrate in the latter. In any case, this sounds terrific. will have to give it a go.\nI am a big fan of your website btw. thanks."
