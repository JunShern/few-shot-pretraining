    "text": "Fans, coaches and players -- not just officials -- need to step up their games before disaster strikes.\nIf you follow me on social media (the math involving my modest number of followers says it\u2019s unlikely) you know I\u2019ve been consistent in my bewilderment at the officiating of area high school football games this season.\nOfficiating has affected, and perhaps determined, the outcome of several games. My beef hasn\u2019t simply been about judgment calls that appeared to be judged incorrectly (those happen), but rather with the mechanics.\nCrews have often bumbled yardage mark offs, spots (the ball can\u2019t be exactly on the yard line EVERY time \u2013 that\u2019s lazy), downs and rules. The common occurrences expose inexperienced, perhaps undertrained officials.\nHowever, there are reasons for the above. Who in the heck would want to be an official today? One hundred bucks a game isn\u2019t terrible, but do you want to be the subject of nonstop verbal abuse for three hours?\nShreveport football officiating 101: Why take the abuse?\nThe officiating hasn't been the only embarrassing factor in games I\u2019ve attended, or received reports from. I\u2019m not sure if some coaches spent more time calling plays and schemes or crawling in the ear holes of the folks in stripes.\nThe actions in the stands isn\u2019t any better. If the right team wins or executes a terrific play, fans are happy. If not, it\u2019s the officials\u2019 fault. The mind-set is completely out of control.\nI covered the North Webster-Loyola game last week and witnessed the cops called to the field twice. One instance involved a disruptive member of the chain gang, the second sent a handful of officers to track down an unruly, profanity-loving fan.\nYoung athletes aren\u2019t winning in life if parents and coaches conjure excuses to blame everyone else for a lack of execution or the fact another team/player is simply better. Winning is terrific; I\u2019m as competitive as they come. However, losing can teach us all just as much, and, in the long run, produce victories.\nI\u2019ve never heard of a college coach or NFL scout pass on a kid because the referee made a bad call. If your kid is good enough, he or she will get there. And it\u2019s better off if they\u2019re tough and able to self-evaluate. If they look the other way and point fingers amid adversity, good luck, the road will be much bumpier.\nIt\u2019s not good for anyone to look into the stands and see parents literally fighting (not at the Week 10 game I attended), or throwing food on the field because of a perceived bad call. It\u2019s also not good to see officials (barely) escape a mob of hysterical fans \u2013 despite the help of policemen -- at a local game.\nOne local coach called the referee at the center of the Loyola-North Webster game \u201cthe one guy I\u2019d choose to referee my games.\u201d The point: Officials, like your favorite team, can struggle. They\u2019re human. But they didn\u2019t put your boys in a three-touchdown hole.\nAmazingly, fans don\u2019t credit officials after victories. How is that possible?\nI'm more incensed by the aftermath of such incidents like the ones I witnessed at Loyola. Adult rarely (at best) take responsibility for their \u2013 or fellow fans\u2019 \u2013 actions. A bad call doesn\u2019t give the rest of us carte blanche. Imagine if everyone around you lost their marbles and you became a bull's-eye for vitriol after you dub a coach\u2019s decision \u201cidiotic\u201d moments before it works and you\u2019re on your feet cheering.\nAs Friday\u2019s game developed, some of the Loyola players popped off in frustration, and that\u2019s not to be excused, but they, along with Loyola coaches, were ultimately forced to turn from the field of play and tell their fan base to cool it as things got heated at Messmer Stadium.\nThe kids had to tell the parents to act like adults.\nBy no stretch are the officials or fans present at the Loyola game the only problem. I\u2019ve seen it \u2013 on and off the field -- all season. However, it was Week 10. We\u2019re now in the postseason. If we don\u2019t compose ourselves, playoff implications could take rage to another level and that\u2019s when national headlines \u2013 not good ones -- could be made.\n\u201cJohnny\u201d doesn\u2019t want to carry the burden of watching his parents punching (or worse) a fan or official on YouTube for the rest of his life.\nBoo the officials or opposing fans all you want, it\u2019s tradition. However, verbal and physical abuse is sometimes illegal and always completely embarrassing. The actions, the threats toward officials are getting worse.\nI know social media, and the current climate, has made it OK to call each other names, disrespect one another and demean opinions without merit, but for crying out loud think about your actions when you\u2019re in public. At least spam-like usernames and accounts can help hide your identity on social media.\nBut Friday nights are real life. With real-life implications. Coach the games, watch the games, officiate the games. Stop deflecting blame and embrace the teachable moments in wins and losses. And more importantly, remember those are fellow human beings who drop passes, miss blocks and butcher pass interference calls.\nWe can all be better. We must be better."
