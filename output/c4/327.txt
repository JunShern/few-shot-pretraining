    "text": "\u201cPersonal Branding\u201d is extremely important in today\u2019s digital economy. Knowing how to effectively manage it is equally important, if not more so.\nThe question is whether you will take control of it\u2026 because if you don\u2019t someone else will (or the masses).\nI decided that I\u2019d rather manage it instead of the social media landscape that could do whatever they wanted with it, for better or for worse really.\nSo, I bought JohnSaddington.com (site has changed, link to DEMO below) and just sat on it for awhile, but I wasn\u2019t sure what I should do with it.\nObviously it couldn\u2019t stay like that. At first I thought I should purchase some ready-made website (like GetNectar.com who was an obvious inspiration but will set you back 200 bucks or so\u2026 but they do have some amazing other versions and flavors!) or off-the-shelf app or theme. \u2026 Bleh. I knew I could do better for free.\nSo, I set out to develop a WordPress theme that would help do that in a creative and attractive way. I wanted something simple, elegant, and super easy to change as my brand changed. I wanted it super light weight, memorable, and had elements that mattered.\nI also wanted to make it readily available at no cost to my friends, family, and many others, especially in today\u2019s economy.\nI\u2019ve had a lot of friends laid off recently and as they search for jobs and as businesses/recruiters/HR managers review their credentials and use Google to help find the \u201creal\u201d you (hopefully they don\u2019t find the MySpace picture of you half-naked and piss-drunk) wouldn\u2019t it be nice, I thought, if they found YourName.com instead with an attractive and impactful first impression?\nSo the Ipseity Personal Branding WordPress Theme was born.\n\u201cIpseity\u201d means selfhood, or individual identity. I couldn\u2019t think of a better name for the theme (and I wanted something original).\nIt\u2019s powered by WordPress, it\u2019s super light weight, around 150kb total file size (without background images), only 3 .php files, 1 .css file, and 2 essential .gifs (the arrow keys), and a js folder for the side-scrolling action.\nIt\u2019s also easily styled with H1/H2/H3 tags and you can add images\u2026 heck, you could even make it a photo portfolio with style!\nI\u2019ve included a few backgrounds for inspiration as you can see as well as a few screenshots of how to control the styling. It\u2019s pretty simple and straightforward.\nI made it super easy to manage, update, and change.\nEach section is just a single blog entry/post.\nI\u2019ve even included \u201cdummy data\u201d for you to import into your WordPress install so you can get started even faster.\nThe following images show you how it all works (there\u2019s not much\u2026).\nIf you want to add images like the last example, just make sure that they are 940 pixels wide by 600 pixels tall to fit perfectly into the theme.\nThe theme is pretty strict in terms of width, so I wouldn\u2019t deviate from these dimensions, unless you do something like a much smaller image for a bio image.\nAgain, you could have an all-image gallery for your personal brand or portfolio.\nMix it up with alternating images and text.\nTo manage the actual text, I\u2019m just using H1/H2/H3 tags for the main title and copy below.\nThe regular \u201cparagraph\u201d text is available to use as well, of course.\nOk. I\u2019m Ready. I Want To Download It!\nHere you go. Have fun and tell others!\nPlease feel free to comment and leave examples of your personal brand site using Ipseity! It\u2019ll help other people visualize what others have done with the theme and the possibilities. Think of it as a community activity.\nAgain, feel free to leave your thoughts, comments, and \u201cimprovements\u201d\u2026! And let me know if you use it! I want to see some kickbutt examples!\nOh, and one final thing: If you need a cheap (but good and legit) host to get a new .com website, check out this deal I\u2019m sporting here with Dreamhost.com!"
