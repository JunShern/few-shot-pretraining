    "text": "In ESO, dungeon enables players interact with each other. You can do the quests, collect the items and chests, kill the boss, etc. But there are still some things you should not to do in a dungeon. Here we collect players' advice from the community.\n1).In the group, your fellow players can be a resource; don't deliberately ignore people when they are giving you dungeon mechanics. Don't be the guy who accuses the healer of only using \"one resto staff talent\" when she actually has six ones slotted and is running Lamia's and Treasure Hunter to max out crit heals and turn her non panacea ultimate into an aoe heal. By the way, deliberately queueing wrong is so selfish.\n2). Don't zone into the dungeon and then decide that you need to grab food from a vendor and/or xp buff. If you queue for a dungeon, be ready when you enter, don't waste others' time.\n3). If you can't handle the trash mob you pulled, don't kite them away expecting the tank to run after you. Instead run towards tank, block and you might as well survive.\n4). If the overall dps is bad, don't attack random trash mobs with single target attacks. If you do single target, take out priority targets. Usually it's the bigger foe like Harvester, Flesh Atronach, healers, summoners, and so on.\n5). In general there's no point in running from trash mobs or adds. Running around does not mitigate damage. So unless you're avoiding 'RED' try to minimize your movements, so healer and tank can help you.\n6). You cannot force a tank to do it if the boss has knock down mechanics / one shot targeted specific to the tank. Healer job is rather to keep everyone alive than to revive them ( even if the room is full of ads , you will probably not be able to take them all alone and not require heals ).\nI don't know whether you have come across above such things done by other players, also take care of the group and pay attention to the dungeon mechanics. What else do you think is not to do? Tell us. Our online store eso-gold.com is the best place to buy eso gold. Any question you can consult us on live chat. Wish you enjoy the game."
