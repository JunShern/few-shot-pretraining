    "text": "Sometimes the biggest hurdle to getting in shape is simply getting started. The task ahead seems so overwhelming that remaining on the sofa seems the safest option.\nThat\u2019s what happened with one of my clients. When she came to me she had been attending the gym on a regular basis, but was not making progress. She was frustrated. She was putting in the time so why wasn\u2019t anything happening?\nHer problem was one so many have \u2013 she was busy working on her fitness but she was essentially just punching her workout timecard and going home.\nSince she had recently started back to college, I made an analogy I thought would be relevant; I compared structuring her weight loss quest in the same manner she went about going back to school.\nThis analogy immediately clicked with her, and she excitedly told me I should \u201csave this and use it again.\u201d So, I\u2019m sharing it here!\nWhat degree will you earn?\nUnless you have loads of money and extra time, you\u2019d never enroll in college just to \u201cget smarter,\u201d so an end goal of \u201closing weight\u201d or \u201cgetting in shape\u201d is not specific enough. You need to pick the exact field of study and the exact words you want on your diploma. If you don\u2019t know that, you\u2019ll wander around campus aimlessly, never knowing in which classes to enroll or how long you\u2019ll be a student.\nYour \u201cdegree\u201d might be a dress size or a number on the scale, or perhaps you want to finish a race.\nAction: be specific with your end goal and write it down.\nHow long will it take you to graduate?\nJust like academia, the more advanced the degree the longer you\u2019ll need to spend in school. You can\u2019t expect to get your masters in a month, so must you be realistic with your weight loss.\nAction: pick an attainable date and mark it on your calendar.\nSo, get out your calendar for the next several months. Find chunks of several weeks at a time, preferably between vacations and big events where you might be tempted to get off track. If you\u2019re really serious, you could schedule your vacation around your semester -it just depends how committed you are to this goal.\nAction: take the space on your calendar between now and \u201cgraduation\u201d and divide it into shorter training/break periods.\nThe dreaded college applications! Don\u2019t worry, yours won\u2019t be so bad. In this case you\u2019ll be completing a baseline assessment. And it will have nothing to do with the number on the scale.\nYou have to know what your body is physically capable of doing right now, before you start. It\u2019s kind of like figuring out whether you test into the 100 level or 200 level courses in school \u2013 being placed in the wrong level will be a waste of your time.\nSo, how do you know where you belong?\nCreate a task or series of tasks that test your physical capabilities now. It could be as simple as timing yourself to see how long it takes you to walk a mile, or a much more complex series of drills \u2013 as long as they are measurable. For an example of a no-equipment needed assessment, see here.\nAction: determine your baseline assessment exercise(s) and complete it. Write down your results.\nWhat \u201cclasses\u201d must you take to earn your degree and what days and times are they scheduled? In this situation, \u201cclasses\u201d could also mean group exercise classes, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily need to be that. It could be any mode(s) of exercise(s) that helps you earn your diploma.\nThe most important part is that you are specific about what you\u2019ll do when and where. For example; Mon/Wed \u2013 strength class at gym, Tue/Thurs \u2013 HIIT DVD at 6am, Fri \u2013 yoga class at gym, Saturday \u2013 3 mile run/walk @7am, Sun \u2013 rest day. Schedule it as you would your college classes and you\u2019ll be less likely to skip \u2013 after all, you only get so many absences before you fail the course!\nAction: put your \u201cclasses\u201d in your calendar and make necessary arrangements to show up.\nAs much fun as they may be (not!) quizzes are necessary to make sure you\u2019re on track. Here\u2019s where the aforementioned \u201cbaseline assessment\u201d comes in again. Retake this test half-way through your semester, and then again at the end.\nYour first few quizzes will most likely show improvements. Once you get to the point where the results are minimal, you\u2019ll know it\u2019s time to readjust your \u201cclass\u201d schedule.\nThere is nothing wrong with getting on the scale during this process, but make a deal with yourself. You may only weigh yourself on quiz days. This way you\u2019ll be sure to keep the emphasis and focus on improving your strength and endurance. The size of your jeans will just be a bonus.\nAction: in the beginning of the semester, select your quiz dates and hold yourself to it.\nYou might need someone to actually hold yourself to it (quizzes \u2013 see #5.) Your professor doesn\u2019t necessarily need to remind you to train every day \u2013 just needs to monitor your tests. After all, those test scores will speak volumes if you haven\u2019t been gong to class.\nAction: think of someone who can hold you accountable. When you complete your baseline assessment, send this person your results. Tell him/her when to expect the follow-up test results and ask to be held accountable for producing them.\nOnce you hit your goal and earn your degree, you\u2019re not done. You\u2019ll need to earn continuing education credits to stay fresh. Just like before, you\u2019ll want to look at your calendar for the next year and plan your semesters. They don\u2019t all have to be as grueling or intense as your initial diploma-earning \u201ceducation,\u201d but they should be planned in advance. Most of them will be lighter semesters where you coast, but you\u2019ll want to include at least one intense semester each year. One where you train with purpose, and train for results. If need be, register for an event or race \u2013 something that gives you a deadline to train and keeps you from procrastinating.\nAction: once you earn your initial degree, plan your entire next year in advance. Learn from your hits and misses during this first experience and apply it to make the next year even better!\nWhat are other analogies that could be made to structuring a fitness plan? Let us know so we can share it with others!"
