Great staff, instructors, counseling, programs, skills taught for success. I look forward to advancing my career. But there is a missing point that through this serious course material there should be entertainment part, to make the class atmosphere more pleasant.\nBy far the best investment I have ever done. 20 days of trading and 27% growth, by the great strategies I\u2019ve gotten from Essential course of @BucketListTraders, I\u2019m so happy. The @BucketListTraders team are amazing. Specially Rana khan is the best choice as an instructor to show me the right path\u2026patiently, he follows each step to clarify the strategies in real case of trading.\nI started with zero knowledge about forex, i wanted to give it a try and was not sure how it will go forward. After many consultations with friends and family, i got recommendation to @Bucket list company and i signed for BLT's essential courses and through one month of webinar couching of Rana khan i could get everything i need to know through one to one online support with him to become a successful trader.I began with \u00a3600 to 'test the water' and soon deposited another \u00a34.5k by great Great management of Rana khan and his professional team, great community and support 10/10 #WinningWith @BucketListTraders Fantastic strategies.They have granted me a lifetime free membership to real traders group+ free daily tips, critical startegies in real trading.\nI came across @BucketListTraders when I realized that I can\u2019t bear with 9-5 jobs and wanted to start my own business\u2026 After reading all basics about how people got into Forex and upgraded their life, finally made my mind that I wanted to buy FOREX ESSENTIAL COURSE! Before stirring the course, knew so many jargons that had absolutely no idea about them, but Thought the lessons, quiz, handouts and helpful webinars picked them all up in first week. I should highlight the support of Rana Khan who was a legend and proper Guru of all\u2026 He was explaining every bit so patiently and that it was sticking to my mind unbelievably. After learning the basics, we moved on to strategies and it was my most favorite part of this course\u2026 Engaging your brain and in simple words it\u2019s basically planning it out ahead so clear\u2026 Once you are sure what to expect it\u2019s time to buy and when you start seeing the dip, it\u2019s a no wait game!! At last, although that I don\u2019t need to go back to my tutorial materials, how be, I still got access to all of them and most importantly I am most active member of the Signal club where we get to know Rana\u2019s views and of the market!! In one word, I can\u2019t be any happier giving up boring life n starting my own traders experience and touch wood so far I haven\u2019t done bad starting trading with only $300!! A MASSIVE Thanks to RANA KHAN, you\u2019re a LEGEND!!"
