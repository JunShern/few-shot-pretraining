    "text": "Do you only work with patients of a certain age?\nWe work with patients of all ages, from infancy through adulthood. It is not unusual for a family to come to us initially because of a child with challenges, and then discover that we can assist parents with a variety of symptoms as well. Our team includes clinicians with expertise in young children, older children, teens, and adults. We also have clinicians able to address the needs of older adults with a variety of neurological and physical challenges.\nDoes my child have to be a certain age to benefit from developmental treatment?\nThe human brain changes throughout the lifespan, so there is no reason to expect that older children and teenagers can\u2019t benefit from treatment. We work with many older children and teens who did not receive intervention when they were younger and are progressing very well in treatment. We tailor treatment to be age and developmentally appropriate for each patient, and have seen tremendous changes in teens and adults as well as very young children.\nWhat if my child doesn\u2019t want to attend therapy or participate?\nThis can often be the case, especially with older children and teenagers. From the first moment we meet patients our team of clinicians focuses on building rapport and making them feel comfortable. We specialize in providing activities that are engaging and motivating for patients, and provide an atmosphere that challenges them in a supportive way. Another important thing to note is that much of our work is done with parents directly, especially in the initial stages of treatment. In unique cases where the child is not available for direct treatment, or where there is too much resistance involved, we can begin to make significant changes by working with the parents on strategies to begin implementing at home.\nDoes a patient need to have a certain diagnosis to participate in treatment?\nWe do not require a diagnosis in order to access treatment. We take the time to carefully investigate an individual\u2019s history and symptoms, whether or not a diagnosis has been given. Our team can provide clinical evaluation and diagnostic services if needed, but the most important thing is to understand what is creating obstacles \u2013 not just looking at labels.\nWe don\u2019t live near your clinic so can we still access services?\nDistance is generally not a problem, as we work with individuals and families from all over the world. Through the use of technology we are able to consult with patients who are not local to our clinic. Depending on the nature of services required, patients and families may make periodic trips to see us in person, but it is possible to receive consultative services at a distance without ever making an in-person visit.\nOur family has tried everything that has come across our path to help our child, and we are still struggling. How can you help us?\nThis is common, and usually the reason is that the root issues of the child\u2019s challenges have not been identified and addressed. Working on higher-level skills without building a solid developmental foundation isn\u2019t effective, and many professionals don\u2019t go deep enough to correct the core issues that are impacting brain and body development. Our goal is to get to the root of the problems & build solid foundations for development so higher level skills can develop in meaningful ways.\nI feel like I have tried everything to address my symptoms, and I am still struggling. Can you help me?\nWe understand how frustrating it can be to spend years seeing professionals without feeling like your symptoms are improving. Too often we see patients who have been told by other practitioners that they just need to \u201clearn to live\u201d with chronic issues like pain, depression, anxiety, headaches, and more. Our goal is to help patients get to the root of the issues that are causing problems so that treatment can be more effective. While we certainly don\u2019t have a magic wand to immediately make symptoms go away, we specialize in walking alongside patients with chronic symptoms to help find answers and solutions. Our thorough evaluation process and innovative treatments may be able to provide relief where others have not.\nOur clinic is credentialed with all major insurance companies as an Out-of-Network provider for most services. We are an In-Network Provider for Speech Therapy and Feeding Therapy for Blue Cross Blue Shield Traditional and PPO plans. For patients who wish to use their out-of-network insurance coverage we are happy to provide a coded bill that can be submitted to the insurance company for reimbursement. We bill BCBS directly for speech and feeding therapy that is considered in-network. We have an insurance assistance packet to assist patients and families with the process of receiving reimbursements for out-of-network payments.\nCan we use our Flex Spending Account or HSA for your services?\nYes, our services are eligible for Flex spending accounts as well as health savings accounts. We provide patients with coded statements to use when paying with funds from these types of accounts. There are often significant tax savings benefits for patients and families who use these accounts, so we encourage all patients to look into their available options."
