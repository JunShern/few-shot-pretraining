    "text": "The Felix Dress is the ideal wardrobe piece to take you from the heat of summer to the cool days of autumn. The loose, breezy shape is perfect on its own or layered with tights and a cardigan. The skirt is eased, rather than gathered, to reduce bulk at the waistline. Three sleeve options provide you with plenty of versatility and a faux wrap bodice gives the look of a wrap dress without potential for mishaps. The Felix also features generous pockets and is fully lined. The unique construction of this dress has a few twists and tricks, so if you like learning new techniques it\u2019s a must sew!\nTechniques involved include sewing a straight seam, easing, lining a dress, setting sleeves, applying armhole bias facings, and hemming.\nSelf: Lightweight fabrics such as cotton voile or batiste, handkerchief linens, rayon and rayon blends, and silks. Avoid fabrics that are stiff or tightly woven, as this dress requires fabrics with drape.\nLining: Lightweight linings such as rayon, rayon Bemberg, or silk. You can use the self fabric for the bodice lining, but we highly recommend using fabrics that won\u2019t cling to the body and skirt for the skirt lining.\nPlease note: Extra fabric may be needed to match plaids, stripes, and one-way designs.\nChinwe\u2019s measurements are 34\u2033 Bust \u2014 29\u2033 Waist \u2014 40\u2033 Hip and is wearing a size 6.\nYou do not need to print all of the pattern files, just the one that corresponds to how you intend to print. If you have additional questions please see our FAQ and Digital Product Policies. If you need help printing and assembling your pattern, take a look at our PDF Printing and Assembly Guide!"
