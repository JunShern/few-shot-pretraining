    "text": "Loewe Creative Director Jonathan Anderson has teamed up with celebrated American Artist Photographer Duane Michals to produce a black and white photo narrative series to go along side Loewe\u2019s static exhibition of AW18 products in their Parisian showroom. Michals photographed the British actor Josh O\u2019Conner as a failed magician, performing in the Teatro Reina Victoria in Madrid. \u201cHe had carte blanche,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cHe came to Madrid and shot these tableaux in an old theater. He painted the backdrops and made the props.\u201d The magician makes the model Erik Frey appear in a new Loewe outfit with each new trick performed. Over a career of 55 years Michal\u2019s is constantly reinventing himself and has produced work from staged photographs to multi-media works with painted and manipulated photographs, as well as constructing elaborate fictional narratives. As well as the exhibition the images will alsobe published as a limited edition volume designed by M/M Paris.\nFollowing her success as creative director at Chloe, Clare Waight Keller has already produced a successful catwalk show for Givenchy and now aims to further cement her status as a successful predecessor to long time designer Riccardo Tisci with the latest ad campaign for Givenchy Spring 2018. The campaign, shot by Steven Meisel, again gives both Men\u2019s and Women\u2019s sides parity as was set out in her debut show. The campaign was shot in a private mansion in upstate New York and features black and white portraits that mirror the Givenchy collection. The portraits are positioned next to bold colour photographs of accessories, of which Keller has said will become a very important part of her tenure at Givenchy. The images portray an intimate setting among friends casually hanging out and have a very 70\u2019s rocker vibe. \u201cI wanted the models\u2019 attitude to be engaging so I asked them to just be themselves, as they might if they were invited to a party at a friend\u2019s home,\u201d said Keller. \u201cI think that they really capture the spirit of a generation that loves fashion, but most of all they love making it their own.\u201d As well as Steven Meisel behind the camera, the 70\u2019s influenced style was pushed further by Guido Palau doing the hair and Pat McGrath producing minimal smokey eyes.\nBalenciaga has just released its SS18 campaign which features real families, in a take on the awkward family photograph. Following on from the previous Paris Fashion Week presentation of using real families for models, the latest off beat images are a collaboration between photographer Robbie Augspurger and stylist & frequent Vetements collaborator Lotta Volkova. The images are simple portrait style settings harking back to a 70\u2019s \u2018norm-core\u2019 style. Vestments have also announced they will be returning to the catwalk for the Paris men\u2019s fashion week this January with a coed show.\nJapanese designer, musician and producer Hiroshi Fujiwara is to showcase his \u2018Slumbers\u2019 photo exhibition at #FR2 Gallery. Viewers can be expected to find themselves immersed in the experience of being deep in the forest, with a full interactive concept. The godfather of Ura-Harajuku fashion and a major globally influential streetwear designer will also be releasing music along side the exhibition this coming Wednesday. As well as the artwork the show will also introduce limited edition \u2018Slumber\u2019 t-shirts, postcards and other accessories. Hiroshi is known for being the pioneer of Nike\u2019s HTM line and the Venom line for Levis."
