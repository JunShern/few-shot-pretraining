    "text": "If you're into mosaic art then the Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis is the place for you. Containing more mosaic art in one place than any other single location in the world, the designs here were installed by a family of artists and contain more than 41 million tiles!\nThe symbol of St. Louis is a must-see for any tourist by car rental from St. Louis Airport. Symbolizing a gateway to The West, the arch accessorizes the city skyline from its stance in Jefferson Expansion National Memorial Park. The elevator up to the top provides the most excellent view over St. Louis, and the little history museum under the arch is worth checking out to learn about its design and construction.\nLaclede's Landing is the St. Louis equivalent of an old town, but also where old meets new. Take your group by car rental to shop and dine on cobblestone streets, visit the wax museum, and then head to the newly constructed casino complex, Lumiere Place. Not just gaming, the casino is 24 vertical floors of entertainment!\nJust across the river in Illinois you can visit the Cahokia Mounds by St. Louis car rental. This UNESCO World Heritage site happens to be the largest pre-Columbian city found north of Mexico.\nAfter your trip to see the pre-Columbian mounds, take a wine tour or go antique shopping in by St. Louis car rental in Alton. Alton has several great wineries, 50 antique shops, plus plenty of fine dining and even a few golf courses to sweeten the deal.\nLocated at Camp Dubois, where the Missouri River converges to the Mississippi River, is the site from where the famed explorers set out to begin their journey to the Pacific. The Lewis and Clark State Memorial Park is a great day trip from St. Louis by car hire for hiking on short trails, camping, or a family picnic."
