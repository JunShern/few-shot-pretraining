    "text": "As a firm, Berwins has a proud reputation as a winning team, offering expert legal services which help people and businesses at every stage of their journeys - an area I'm personally involved in with Berwins' CQS (Conveyancing Quality Scheme) accredited Residential Property team.\nOver the past few months, I\u2019ve found myself in contact with another winning team - The National Health Service, an organisation which has reached the grand old age of 70 \u2013 retirement age for most of us but not, I\u2019m glad to say, for the NHS.\nLike the generous employers they are, the directors at Berwins provide staff with private health care but there are occasions where it\u2019s not relevant and I have recently found myself in that position, having received a diagnosis of cancer.\nI had heard people say that when needed the NHS really swings into action and boy, doesn\u2019t it just. Within a month I was booked into St James\u2019s Hospital in Leeds for surgery having had tests and meetings at Harrogate with my fantastic consultant and equally fantastic Macmillan nurse team and I duly presented myself at 7.00 am (6.15 am actually \u2013 we didn\u2019t realise how quiet the traffic would be at that time of day). My lovely children were packed off to get some breakfast, lucky things, whilst I sipped water only to be told late in the morning that my operation was cancelled.\nNow, please don\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 there is absolutely no way I am complaining here. Everyone at Berwins knows how well I have been treated by everyone I have come across on this journey of mine and a cancelled operation is just one of those things that can happen \u2013 somebody more poorly than me needed that bed in HDU that day.\nMy operation was re-scheduled for the following week and went ahead without a hitch and I\u2019m now back at home, having timed things beautifully so that I can watch Wimbledon.\nThis experience has made me think. I wrongly assumed that there just wasn\u2019t a bed available in HDU when I needed it \u2013 wrong, there was. There just weren\u2019t enough nurses.\nOn the day my operation was cancelled, my surgical team were all ready and then left with nothing to do for the afternoon. I asked my consultant what the cost to the NHS was - \u00a318 per minute was the reply. What an incredible waste for the cost of nurse for a day.\nMy consultant fought my corner hard when my operation seemed likely to be cancelled again for the same reason and for that I shall be eternally grateful to him \u2013 it\u2019s a brave man who takes on the Head of Nursing. However, I\u2019m also acutely conscious that somebody else had their operation cancelled, possibly for a second time too and that really should not happen.\nI know that I am receiving the best possible care from a whole host of people some of whom, such as Macmillan, are funded by donations but the majority so far are paid by you and me. The NHS is not an inanimate object \u2013 it is an organism made up of a bunch of ordinary people doing an exceptional job for not a huge financial reward.\nI bet everyone reading this knows somebody who has benefitted from our precious NHS in a similar way to me. Being a winning team, takes investment and dedication. Please don\u2019t take it for granted, write to your MP, as I shall, so that it remains the envy of the world.\nWhen is flooding not flooding?\nCould your property be affected by a sinkhole?"
