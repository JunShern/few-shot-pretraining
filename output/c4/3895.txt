    "text": "Q: My great uncle, born in 1874 was the keeper of this bottle which he kept in a curio cabinet in my childhood. It might have belonged to another relative who worked in the china department of Woolworths from 1910-1930. Is it possible that such an item would be sold at Woolworths? My uncle also inherited items from a friend who was a scholar at the University of Leipzig circa 1898. My wife and I would be interested in learning anything you can tell us about this attractive object.\nA: Your attractive figural fish scent bottle is very rare. It is hand-blown green cased glass which has an inner white layer, a middle vibrant green layer and an outer clear layer harboring the applied gilt enamel. The tail is shaped and molded when the glass is molten with a hand tool. The eye is an applied red cabochon set in white enamel. The sterling silver cap was made by the firm of George Edwin Walton & Co. Ltd. in 1881-82 at Hylton Street, Birmingham. It harbors a cork which seals when screwed on. As the bottle can only lay on its side the cork was kept moist, causing it to swell keeping it sealed. These figural scent bottles are usually attributed to Thomas Webb & Sons \u2013 one of the most successful glass companies of England operating in the Stourbridge area close to Birmingham. These virtually never come on the market and at auction it will probably swim to $2,500 or more.\nQ: My husband\u2019s brother inherited the ancestral home which contained a few antiques. No one knows how old this pitcher and bowl set is or where it came from, but we would like to know if it has any value. The name \u2018Walmer\u2019 and \u2018E.H.\u2019 are markings on the bottom. It is in very good shape.\nA: You have a very early brown transfer wash set dating to the 1850s. The \u2018Walmer\u2019 pattern is quite rare in transfer-decorated pottery. This is a romantic interpretation after the defensive castle built by Henry VIII in the 1500s. It is English and likely stands for Elijah Hughes & Co., of the Bleakhill Works, Cobridge in the Staffordshire region of England. The company operated from 1853 to 1867 making earthenwares. The shape of the pitcher and basin is typical for the 1840s and \u201950s with the eight-sided panels. It\u2019s a durable ironstone body and was also done in blue and white and an almost black mulberry. It\u2019s in remarkable condition and is worth $250 today.\nA: Delos Cline Bell is the artist. He is known mainly for oil paintings of portraits and genre scenes \u2014 and they are all rare. Yours extends the known period of his painting career as well as the geographic area he worked in since he is listed as being active from 1850 to 1877 in the areas of Hamilton (being born in Beamsville in 1829) and Ottawa. He died in 1918. His work is crisp with a slightly primitive element to it \u2014 a desirable characteristic that is also present in yours. The high detail of the house architecture and the garb of the four figures makes it historically interesting. This small piece of art will have collectors reaching in their pockets for at least $500."
