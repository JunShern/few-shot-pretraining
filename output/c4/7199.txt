    "text": "Welcome to those of you joining me from DISTherapy and those of you just hopping aboard. I am the Final stop on our Magical Blogorail.\nLast December, my family went to Walt Disney World for a Christmas vacation. It was the first time we were seeing the Christmas decor at Disney World, and there was something super special about seeing the World in all it\u2019s Christmas glory. I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve ever seen anything like it \u2013 and it didn\u2019t disappoint this year, either, when we went in November for a quick trip for my birthday!\nOne of the thing that my family splurged on last year for Christmas gifts, was Mickey\u2019s Very Merry Christmas Party. We\u2019d always heard good things about it, but since we\u2019d never done Disney in the fall, or at Christmas, we were excited to give it a try!\nThe night that we decided to do Mickey\u2019s Very Merry Christmas Party, we started off at dinner at Liberty Tree Tavern with our dear friends, Melissa from Rolling With the Magic, and her husband. It was a great way to start the evening, and we had a scrumptious dinner before a long night at the Magic Kingdom park.\nProbably my favorite part of the whole Christmas Party, was the fact that you could meet characters that weren\u2019t always around in the parks. We got to stand in line to meet so many of them, and it fun to get them to sign our autograph books, and have a picture taken with them! Probably my favorite was meeting Flynn Rider, as I\u2019ve been in love with him since the movie Tangled came out a few years ago!\nAnother cool set of characters we got the chance to meet with were ALL the 7 dwarfs! Right after dinner, we went straight to get in line with them, and got our picture taken with Melissa & Drew.\nI guess I am just young at heart \u2013 isn\u2019t everyone at Disney? \u2013 because I just love to spend time meeting with characters, and could honestly just do that! Disney is pretty good about getting people that can easily play the part of the characters, and I\u2019m always thrilled when they take the time to actually interact with you.\nAfter we meet-and-greeted some of our favorite characters, we decided that we\u2019d watch the parade. We watched by Peco\u2019s Bills \u2013 right where the parade started. It was NOT the best location, and we said if we ever went back we\u2019d try to see it somewhere different. *Note: we went this year, and were too tired to stay and watch the parade, so this is still something on our list of things to do! I want to see the Christmas parade from Main Street USA so that I can see the snow falling! :p There\u2019s gotta be something magical about the snow falling when it\u2019s warm!\nA bunch of the restaurants are serving complimentary hot chocolate and snickerdoodle cookies, as well! You can go back for as much as you want! We stopped by quite a few of the restaurants for these snacks throughout the evening!\nOne of the highlights of the whole evening was getting to meet Captain Jack Sparrow. I had never met him before, and he was out when we were leaving the park, so we had to stop for a quick picture \u2013 and to get our autograph books signed!\nWhile the price of the Christmas party is $67 per adult and $62 per child, I think that it\u2019s well worth the money for what you get! The park is a lot emptier during the party, and you can walk on a bunch of the rides without much of a line at all. For instance, we only waited 10 minutes in line for Peter Pan\u2019s Flight, instead of the normal 1.5-2 hour wait that it often has!\nHave you ever done Mickey\u2019s Very Merry Christmas Party? If so, what was your favorite part?\nThank you for joining Magical Blogorail Blue this month. We will be back in January with an all new theme. Keep checking in with our blogs in between loops to keep up to date with our Disney info, photos and stories. If you are looking for more Disney magic, you can make your way over to The Magical Blogorail website to see all our members and their blogs, as well as all our previous loops.\nWe went to our first MVMCP this year! We had seen some of the elements of the party from our trip the week before New Year\u2019s Eve back in 2010. The party is great! It\u2019s definitely a good idea to have a plan and make sure you eat dinner before the party starts!! We did a mix of some characters, one of the dance parties, some rides, and saw the parade and fireworks. I love the dance parties because you get some great interaction with the characters. I think my favorite part was Holiday Wishes.\nIt really is great fun! My one suggestion (which I learned the hard way this year) is to get some rest in the afternoon that day \u2013 or wait and head to the park later. Otherwise, like we found out, it\u2019s much too tiring to try to spend a full day at MK and then follow up with the party. I\u2019m really kicking myself that we didn\u2019t see the parade from Main Street and enjoy that snow.\nGosh, this loop is making me wish I lived closer to FL to enjoy the holidays at WDW!! We definitely have this on our bucket list, Christmas at Walt Disney World \u2013 I\u2019ve got to get to Mickey\u2019s Very Merry Christmas Party!! So cool that you got hot chocolate and goodies as an attendee! Sign me up! Is the entire park open for this event? Or is it separated, like Mickey\u2019s Halloween Party at Disneyland Park, to one area.\nYour family knows how to do things right Ashley- a magical family experience beats a wrapped gift any day! (And how nice that you had extended family that night. :D) This party is certainly not cheap, but the decorations, SNOW, fireworks, parade, hot cocoa and characters make for a holiday extravaganza. Of course, the novelty of some of the Disney Characters can lead to some long and chilly lines; we waited about 90 minutes for the Seven Dwarfs. How did you fare??"
