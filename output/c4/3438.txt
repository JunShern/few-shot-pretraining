A particular benefit of the product is that because it works on a physical level there is no possibility of a virus mutation creating resistance which is typical with antibiotics overuse.They are ideal for use during the colder seasons of the year, before and during typical flu periods and of course when travelling by plane, train or underground, where close contact with other people is unavoidable.\nActive ingredient- 1 lozenge contains 73.5 mg Cistus Villosus extract with 50mg polyphenols. - Isomalt, cellulose, xylite, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, gum arabic, magnesium stearate, silicon dioxide, Acesulfam K, natural flavours, modified starch."
