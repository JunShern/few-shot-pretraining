    "text": "Don\u2019t you love this time of year? I sure do. I love the cooler weather and changing colors in nature. Autumn decorations that mark the Autumn season are also among my favorite.\nOf course, the pumpkins are a familiar sight this time of year and today I\u2019m sharing pumpkin art with a paper crafting twist.\nThis is the first time I\u2019ve ever attempted to make art from a book myself.\nIt\u2019s super easy and throughout this post, I\u2019ll walk you through how I made mine.\nTo be honest, as an ardent book lover, I do think there is something inherently wrong with cutting up books.\nHaving said that, if you do have books around the house that you think will never, ever get picked up again, I suppose it\u2019s OK.\nYou may feel more comfortable (as I did) about using cheap thrift shop books rather than cutting up paperbacks from your own personal library.\nWhatever you settle on, first thing you\u2019ll have to do is to remove the front and back cover.\nYou\u2019ll only need a handful of supplies for this project including a hot glue gun, an X-Acto knife, scissors, a pencil and a self-healing cutting mat for this project.\nSelf-healing cutting mats are made of a thick flexible plastic and are often used with rotary cutters.\nThese mats come in a variety of sizes, large and small and can be found at most crafts stores in the sewing supply aisle.\nYou\u2019ll need to create a template.\nI printed the shape of a pumpkin just to give me an idea of how to shape my own guide.\nDraw a dotted line down the center of our sketch.\nFold the pumpkin sketch in half along the dotted line. You\u2019re only going to use one half of the template.\nBefore cutting out the template, make sure the pumpkin half will actually fit within the book you plan to cut.\nTrim the template accordingly to get the perfect fit for the book.\nSlide the self-healing mat under 4-5 pages.\nPlace the template on top of the pages and carefully use the X-Acto knife to cut the pages along the template.\nLimit the number of pages you cut at one time to about 4-5. If you stack too many pages, the knife may not cut through them cleanly.\nAfter cutting the first set, slide the mat under the next stack of pages and repeat until you get to the end of the book.\nGet ready. The cutting process can get a little messy with paper slivers ending up just about everywhere including in your hair and on your clothes.\nJust take your time, and watch what you\u2019re doing carefully. Always be aware of where your fingers are in relation to the moving blade.\nX-Acto knives/blades are super sharp and can be very dangerous.\nI don\u2019t recommend allowing young children to use X-Acto knives unless you\u2019re confident in their ability to handle a blade and then, only allow use under strict supervision.\nI like adding texture to a project like this.\nKeep that in mind as you consider what to use for a pumpkin stem.\nYes, cinnamon sticks are a great option for a stem. Just cut it to size and hot glue it into place.\nOther choices include braided jute, real pumpkins stems, twigs and small branches.\nNOTE: Even if you don\u2019t use a real pumpkin stem for this project, save your real stems this year for upcoming projects. You can see my previous post on how to dry pumpkin stems for crafting projects HERE. Also, check out my velvet pumpkins project which feature real stems HERE.\nUse a hot glue to connect the two sides of the book together along the spine. You may also want to hot glue the two end pages together for added security.\nAfter the book is secured in the pumpkin shape, just hot glue the stem onto the top. I personally like how the pumpkin stem looks but like I said, you could use just about anything for a stem.\nNOTE: As you can see, some of the page edges are a little rough. That comes from trying to cut too many pages at one time with the X-Acto knife.\nJust trim any rough edges with a pair of scissors and you\u2019ll be fine.\nWhile the pumpkin looks just fine in it\u2019s raw state, I wanted to see how it would look with a little paint along the edges.\nYou could paint the edges pumpkin orange but I went with a brown, wine color for a more vintage, understated presentation.\nFold the book and use a sponge brush to apply several coats of craft paint across the outside of the pages.\nOnce the paint has dried, you may notice that many of the pages will stick together.\nGently pull each page apart to ensure the finished pumpkin is nice and full and plump.\nIf you have any artificial leaves, use the hot glue gun to apply them to the top of the pumpkin.\nOnce the leaves have been glued in place, hot glue the stem on top.\nOf course, the size of your book will determine the size of your pumpkin.\nImagine how lovely an arrangement of assorted pumpkin sizes would look.\nI\u2019ve been busy on a very special project and I think you\u2019re going to love it.\nI\u2019ll share the exciting news right here very soon.\nThis is one of the most beautiful paper crafts I have ever seen! How did I miss this?!!\nI hope you decide to make one.\nThey\u2019re actually quite fun. Just be very careful with that exacto knife.\nOh, good for you, Paula.\nIt\u2019s a fun project and quite simple.\nKeep your eyes peeled for those dried pumpkin stems.\nAlso, consider saving as many stems as you can this season. Dry them out for future crafting projects.\nI have a post on drying stems. Just do a quick search.\nEnjoyed your Tutorial. I love pumpkins and scarecrows for fall.I can keep them out for months \ud83d\ude00 The Organized Dream sent me over to you.\nThanks, I\u2019m glad you like the tutorial.\nI agree, Carolyn. Fall is my favorite time of year too.\nHappy day to you and thanks for popping by.\nCongratulations on your NEW beautiful, fantastic blog! I once contacted you about your blog before the change and have followed you forever. It was amazing then. Now, it is more amazing! I haven\u2019t seen anything on your blog, that I wouldn\u2019t make or cook.\nThanks Elisa! Let me know what projects and/or recipes you tackle.\nOhhhh! Can\u2019t wait to hear the news!!!!!!\nAnd your book pumpkin is AMAZING!\nYou are brave, your pumpkin looks enchanting. I\u2019ll have to try this too . Thank you for the tutorial.\nThis is the nicest book pumpkin I have seen in blogland!\nLisa I love it!! I\u2019m a book lover too but where we are visiting, the library is having a sale this weekend \u2014 I\u2019ll get an old worn out book and make the pumpkin. The kinda antique, old look about it is wonderful. I can\u2019t wait to make it. Your tutorial is great.\nAbsolutely beautiful and so creative. I really look forward to every one of your posts they are truly inspiring."
