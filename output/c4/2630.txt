Archaeologists and ethnologists believe, that the big stones here (megaliths), was used as a form of protection, for the dead to not be disturbed, or protected from evil spirits.\nThis prehistoric cemetery, is believed to have existed during the bronze age, because of the human bones and artifacts found on the site. The municipality of Santa Margalida, has invested more than 100.000 euros in this project.\nThe cemetery has been fenced, to protect it, as excavations are still going on. The site is located rather strange, behind an industrian area, in the outskirts of town, s\u00e5 don\u2019t be surprised, enjoy the many free parking spaces."
