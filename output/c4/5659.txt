Part of our commitment includes making sure you have access to the resources and information you need to fulfill your own role in ensuring excellence in respiratory patient care.\nTo find the resources you need, click or tap on a category below.\nFind out everything you need to know by watching our ten instructional and informational videos created with candidates and credentialed practitioners in mind and based on the most frequently asked questions we receive.\nIn these videos, candidates will be guided through the online application process, discover why it is important not to share content from examinations, and see how to order a credential verification once a credential is earned.\nCredentialed practitioners will learn what is required to maintain their credential, how to access their personal dashboard to provide credential maintenance information and order products, and find out the benefits of earning a specialty credential.\nVideos also include topics such as how examination questions are developed, NBRC\u2019s sponsoring organizations, use of NBRC credentials for licensing and so much more!\nVisit our FAQ page for answers to your questions about our seven credentialing examinations, NBRC member services, the benefits of active status, maintaining your credentials, and more.\nVisit our Document Library for fast access to the Candidate Handbook, applications, exam content outlines, program brochures, and more.\nSince the CRT Examination was first used for state licensure in 1985, the NBRC has fostered a strong partnership with state licensure agencies. Today, 49 states regulate respiratory care practice, and they all recognize NBRC credentials as the standards for licensure, forming the basis for reciprocity and enabling credentialed practitioners to relocate from one state to another with ease.\nTo ensure the value and recognition of the voluntary national credentials, the NBRC has adopted policies that permit the Therapist Multiple-Choice Examination to be administered on behalf of state agencies for legal credentialing. Candidates for state credentialing apply according to procedures established by the state. Questions concerning legal credentialing should be directed to the responsible state agency.\nLog in to the State Licensure Agency Portal below, which includes access to the National Respiratory Care Disciplinary Database. The National Respiratory Care Disciplinary Database was jointly created by the NBRC and the AARC as a repository for final disciplinary actions taken against respiratory care practitioners by state licensure agencies, the NBRC and AARC. Disciplinary actions are considered final after all appeals have been exhausted; pending actions or appeals are not maintained in the database.\nEmployers, verification agencies, consumers and credentialed practitioners may obtain online verification of all NBRC credentialed practitioners via the Credentialed Practitioner Directory. Credentialing information provided by the NBRC (electronic, verbal, written or otherwise) is considered primary source verification.\nCredentialed Practitioners \u2013 Login to purchase an official credential verification letter, replacement certificate or wallet card.\nRespiratory care education programs are accredited through the Commission on Accreditation for Respiratory Care (CoARC). CoARC is the sole nationally recognized authority for the accreditation of first professional degree programs in respiratory care. CoARC and its sponsoring organizations cooperate to establish, maintain and promote educational standards of quality to prepare individuals for respiratory care practice, and to provide recognition for degree-granting, post-secondary educational programs that meet the minimum requirements outlined in the Accreditation Standards of the Profession of Respiratory Care.\nThe CoARC publishes a listing of accredited respiratory care programs in the United States and can provide other information about the educational system.\nThe NBRC office will be closed Friday, April 19, 2019, in observance of Good Friday. Normal operating hours will resume Monday, April 22, 2019."
