    "text": "Long Valley was the site of a landmark environmental legal hearing a few years ago. The Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation (owned by the government) wanted to build a viaduct through the middle of the area. The HK Birdwatching Society led a campaign, supported by other green groups to oppose the project.\nRemarkably, the environmentalists won, KCRC lost, and were required to build a tunnel UNDER Long Valley. This says a lot about the rule of law and independence of the judiciary in post-handover HK.\nAnyhow, recent cutting of the rice stalks has been a windfall for both White-rumped and the odd Spotted Munia.\nKCRC has been swallowed up by the Mass Transit Railway Corporation. Who'd have thought Long Valley would outlast it ?\nAlan Knott keeping wicket, Rod Marsh batting The other fielders are Graeme Roope (l) and Bob Woolmer (r) - sadly , no longer with us.\nTaken on Ilford FP3 with a Practica super TL and photax 500mm lens - as if you cared.\nAnyhow, the third Ashes Test gets under way on Thursday. I have so many memories of these contests, everything that happens this week will be coloured by thoughts of past matches.\nWWK Hong Kong organised HK's first \"Big Bird Race\" fundraiser in 1985. By 1988, when I took these pics, about 12 teams were taking part and the individual and corporate sponsorship was over two million HK dollars just that year.\nThe fundraising went off the boil a bit when many of the most successful fundraising team members retired and left HK in the late 1990s.\nIn these straitened economic times, the WWF people have reconsidered their latter-day indifference to the Big Bird Race, and they're going to revive it in 2010.\nEveryone was young, once upon a time."
