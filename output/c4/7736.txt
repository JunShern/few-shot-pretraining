We have been starting to think more about the SATs which occur next term so have been starting to do some practise assessments so that we aren't too surprised by the real things! Class 6 have impressed me with how they have got on with these tasks, doing a Maths paper, SPAG paper and spelling assessment. We have gone through these together so that the children get instant feedback and the chance to ask any questions they may have.\nIn Maths we have consolidated our understanding of ratio and have ensured we have a good strategy for answering these questions: STEM sentence, Bar model, Solve!\nWe have also made some Easter cards this week which have all got an original flair to them!\nWishing you a happy Easter holiday everyone and see you next term.\nY6 enjoying their murder mystery last Friday!\nMr Meacham will provide spellings on a Monday.\nSpellings will be tested on Monday and new spellings given out."
