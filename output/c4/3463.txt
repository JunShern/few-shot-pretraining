    "text": "There are new requirements being put into place for Public Safety Divers. Based on the Scuba Shack\u2019s method and style of training we are at the forefront of helping set those standards. There are always options in terms of training, but considering the inherent risks and liability involved, it\u2019s imperative for Public Safety Divers to actually be able to dive and perform their tasks without putting themselves or team members at risk.\nInitial Consult \u2013 we take the time prior to getting started with training to understand each team member\u2019s equipment. This enables us to make recommendations and square away each diver\u2019s equipment prior to getting started with classes. We also learn about the ability of each diver so we know how to tailor the training.\nLecture \u2013 we believe it\u2019s important to bring the entire team together and talk about each diver\u2019s training experience to date as well as how comfortable they are in the water. It\u2019s important to get everyone on the same page mentally prior to getting into the water.\nThe Diver Equation \u2013 we make sure everyone on the team understands The Diver Equation. The Diver Equation has numerous factors (both dynamic and static) that make a fundamentally sound diver. Some of the dynamic factors include: body positioning, breathing, BCD, and propulsion. Some of the static factors include: weighting, tank selection, lights, hardware and positioning of all equipment. It\u2019s imperative that Public Safety Divers understand each element of the Diver Equation and how it pertains to them in terms of equipment selection as well as in the water.\nFoundation & Fundamentals of Diving \u2013 it\u2019s important for all team members to understand the following: pre-dive planning, equipment selection, gas management, physics over equipment, physics over physiology, pre-dive checks, team diving and the importance of surface support/surface setup.\nPublic Safety Core Principles \u2013 we put all our Public Safety Divers through our Core Principles class. In order to perform task\u2019s in the water, divers must be able to control their buoyancy in the water column. This class allows us to evaluate each diver\u2019s in water capabilities with the goal of bring all divers to the same level of buoyancy control. This class is the foundation for all divers and types of diving and is usually taken at various course levels a few times each year.\nThe Training Environment \u2013 Scuba Shack has year round access to Brownstone Exploration & Discovery Park, a 29 acre quarry. This facility enables Public Safety Divers to train in they type of environment that they will actually encounter. The quarry is equipped with platforms submersed at various depths, navigation courses, and various objects submersed in the water (car, truck, bus, boat, plane, etc\u2026). From ice diving classes in the winter to navigation, rescue, search and recovery and buoyancy courses throughout the year, this environment enables real world scenarios to be re-enacted/performed underwater as well as on the surface.\nStyle of Training \u2013 Scuba Shack is a PADI and Global Underwater Explorer (GUE) certified training center. The Scuba Shack instructors combine their levels of training to create programs that are unrivaled by any other training facility.\nIn summary, combining the capabilities of the Scuba Shack staff\u2019s PADI and GUE qualifications, with the various training environments utilized, Scuba Shack has raised the bar in terms of Public Safety Diver training."
