Electrical, HVAC and fire alarm installations and upgrades to existing systems were required to support the newly configured spaces. These installations and upgrades included audio/visual equipment, additional electrical outlets and connections to emergency generators. The project provided increased chilled water capacity with the addition of an electric centrifugal chiller. Upgrades associated with chiller included upgrade of exhaust ventilation fan, electrical conductor and breaker upgrades, piping and upgrades to air handling equipment.\nDescription: During the grant period we made detailed studies of the dynamics of two level tunneling systems in glasses at very low temperature and by the application of AC and DC electric fields. Models have been developed that now account for both the formation and subsequent breaking of resonant tunneling pairs, and strongly bound pairs in a swept electric field. Perhaps most importantly, we saw a critical field in the polymeric glass Mylar, beyond which recovery following the application of a strong electric field is substantially modified from the predictions of current models. It was essential during the final grant period to see how general these new properties were by testing for them in a new and broader set of glasses. At the same time, the discovery that tunneling systems with nuclei possessing electric quadrupole moments that couple the TS behavior to magnetic fields was studied in this laboratory, using some of the probes that we alone employ. Finally, we were developing our own dielectric pulsed echo system, operating for the first time at the low energy splittings and hence temperatures at which interactions between TS are important. We combined this technique with the sudden application of both electric and strain fields to better understand the dynamics of the response of TS in glasses on a much shorter time scale than is possible with our established probes.\nInspection Report on \"Employment Verification at Savannah River Site\"\nDescription: We conducted a review at the Savannah River Site to determine if Site subcontractors verified the employment status of all employees in accordance with Federal requirements and, if unauthorized individuals accessed the site. During our field work, we reviewed 600 I-9 Forms from 21 subcontractors to verify whether Site subcontractors were using the I-9 Forms; and if the forms were accurate and complete. We also conducted a judgmental sample of individuals who accessed the Site during a six-month period to determine if there were any documentation anomalies.\nDescription: This plan addresses: Greenhouse Gas Reduction and Comprehensive Greenhouse Gas Inventory; Buildings, ESPC Initiative Schedule, and Regional and Local Planning; Fleet Management; Water Use Efficiency and Management; Pollution Prevention and Waste Reduction; Sustainable Acquisition; Electronic Stewardship and Data Centers; Renewable Energy; Climate Change; and Budget and Funding.\nCreator: Erhart, S. C. & Spencer, C.

These communities participated in workshops focused on influenza pandemic planning and response. The 2008 through 2011 workshops were sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Feedback during those workshops indicated the need for a tool that a community can use to assess its readiness for a disaster\u2014readiness from a total healthcare perspective, not just hospitals, but the whole healthcare system. The CAT intends to do just that\u2014help strengthen existing preparedness plans by allowing the healthcare system and other agencies to work together during an influenza pandemic. It helps reveal each core agency partners' (sectors) capabilities and resources, and highlights cases of the same vendors being used for resource supplies (e.g., personal protective equipment [PPE] and oxygen) by the partners (e.g., public health departments, clinics, or hospitals). The CAT also addresses gaps in the community's capabilities or potential shortages in resources. While the purpose of the CAT is to further prepare the community for an influenza pandemic, its framework is an extension of the traditional all-hazards approach to planning and preparedness. As such, the information gathered by the tool is useful in preparation for most widespread public health emergencies. This tool is primarily intended for use by those involved in healthcare emergency preparedness (e.g., community planners, community disaster preparedness coordinators, 9-1-1 directors, hospital emergency preparedness coordinators). It is divided into sections based on the core agency partners, which may be involved in the community's influenza pandemic influenza response.\nCreator: Stiner, K.S.; Graham, S.; Khan, M.; Dilks, J. & Mayer, D.\nCreator: Faletra, P.; Schuetz, A.; Cherkerzian, D & Clark, T.\nDescription: This is our first volume of the Undergraduate Journal. It is an approbation of the impressive research performed by summer interns under the guidance of their dedicated mentors. The full-length publications were chosen from a pool of submissions that were reviewed by many of the excellent scientists at our National Laboratories. Most of these students will pursue careers in science, engineering and technology and, hopefully, some of this talent will remain with our labs. We have also included about 125 abstracts that survived the review process. These were submitted from all of our participating National Laboratories.\nCreator: Faletra, P.; Beavis, W.; Franz, K.; Musick, C.; Walbridge, S.E. & Myron, H.\nDescription: This procedure implements portions of the requirements of MSC-MP-599, Quality Assurance Program Description. It establishes the Mission Support Alliance (MSA) practices for minimizing the introduction of and identifying, documenting, dispositioning, reporting, controlling, and disposing of suspect/counterfeit and defective items (S/CIs). employees whose work scope relates to Safety Systems (i.e., Safety Class [SC] or Safety Significant [SS] items), non-safety systems and other applications (i.e., General Service [GS]) where engineering has determined that their use could result in a potential safety hazard. MSA implements an effective Quality Assurance (QA) Program providing a comprehensive network of controls and verification providing defense-in-depth by preventing the introduction of S/CIs through the design, procurement, construction, operation, maintenance, and modification of processes. This procedure focuses on those safety systems, and other systems, including critical load paths of lifting equipment, where the introduction of S/CIs would have the greatest potential for creating unsafe conditions.\nDescription: This presentation describes the history of the Nevada National Security Site (Nevada Test Site) Contract as well as current capabilities.\nDescription: THESE TWO VOLUMES CONSTITUTE A RECORD OF THE TECHNICAL, ADMINISTRATIVE , AND POLICY-MAKING ACTIVITIES OF THE LOS ALAMOS PROJECT (PROJECT Y) FROM ITS INCEPTION UNDER THE MANHATTAN DISTRICT THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ATOMIC BOMB (VOL.

Shepard, PhD.\nDescription: Wyoming has a wealth of primary energy resources in the forms of coal, natural gas, wind, uranium, and oil shale. Most of Wyoming?s coal and gas resources are exported from the state in unprocessed form rather than as refined higher value products. Wyoming?s leadership recognizes the opportunity to broaden the state?s economic base energy resources to make value-added products such as synthetic vehicle fuels and commodity chemicals. Producing these higher value products in an environmentally responsible manner can benefit from the use of clean energy technologies including Wyoming?s abundant wind energy and nuclear energy such as new generation small modular reactors including the high temperature gas-cooled reactors.\nCreator: Cherry, Robert S. & Richard, Boardman D.\nDescription: This article is an adaptation of the author&#x27;s testimony before the Committee on Science and Technology of the U.S. House of Representatives regarding his experience of performing successful research projects that were initially rejected for funding.\nDescription: Numerous tasks are reported that were done in assistance to the Atlantic Richfield Hanford Company in the area of process technology, and in assistance to the Hanford Plant in the areas of environmental evaluations, radiation protection, and radiation standards and engineering."
