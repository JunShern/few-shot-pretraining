    "text": "A failure to scan outsourced medical records has caused an approximate three- to five-month backlog at the Memphis Veteran Administration Medical Center, The Daily Caller has learned.\nTheDC was exclusively given a photo snapped of the medical records room on June 12, 2014. In the photo, hundreds of unprocessed medical records sit idly, causing delays of up to five months.\nAccording to a whistle-blower who wished to remain anonymous because they are still employed by the Memphis VA Medical Center, the medical records room is for entering test results and other medical data that occurs after a patient is outsourced for medical tests or procedures.\nA recent audit by the VA flagged the Memphis VA Medical Center after it found the facility had an average wait time for the initial appointment of fifty days.\nThe medical records shown in the photo are generated when the VA refers a patient to another hospital for further medical procedures. Medical tests like colonoscopies, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and X-rays, are among the tests that can be performed by an outside hospital, said the whistle-blower.\nThe outside hospital then sends their results back to the Memphis VA Medical Center, and those results are supposed to be scanned into the VA system.\nInstead of being scanned in, the results are piling up, said the whistle-blower, causing further delays beyond the initial wait times.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re waiting for the results of a colonoscopy, [the added wait time is] the difference between life and death,\u201d the whistle-blower told TheDC.\nAccording to this whistle-blower, about an hour after TheDC sent VA communications officer Sandra Glover an email listing these charges, the medical records were moved from the medical records room and into the office of Rebecca England, the chief of Medical Records. Glover is a communications officer for the Veteran Integrated Services Network 9, which includes the Memphis VA Medical Center.\nThe Memphis VA Medical Center is now scrambling, asking dozens to work over-time in order to clear up the back log, and the VA police are investigating the source of the leak to TheDC, the whistle-blower noted.\nThe Memphis VA Medical Center cares deeply for every veteran we are privileged to serve. Our goal is to provide the best quality care in a safe environment, as quickly and effectively as we can. After receiving the photograph you sent, we checked with the Memphis VA Medical Center to determine its validity and, if warranted, what actions could be taken to process those medical records as quickly as possible.\nIt was determined that the record \u2014 forwarded from the facility\u2019s outpatient clinics \u2014 should have been processed, and subsequently the facility took the appropriate actions to scan them in to the electronic patient record. Memphis VA Medical Center hired a new supervisor two months ago in the patient records area and the consult process has been redesigned to better monitor timeliness. We continue to take action to strengthen oversight mechanisms to prevent delays.\nWhile we regret that the files weren\u2019t processed in a more timely fashion, this is an administrative function that did not impact patient outcomes. Critical clinical information was previously communicated with treating clinicians. In the end, these files have been addressed \u2013 which is what we want for the sake of all our patients. Thank you for your concern for our nation\u2019s veterans and for bringing this to our attention.\nTheDC spoke with a veteran who was likely affected by this backlog. Jesse Blakely served in the military in the early 1970s.\nIn November 2013, he walked into the Memphis VA Medical Center complaining of chest pains. After waiting several hours in the emergency room with no help, Blakely left and was treated at nearby Methodist Hospital.\nBlakely said Methodist Hospital ran several tests as part of his treatment, but his follow-up appointment at the Memphis VA Medical Center didn\u2019t occur until the beginning of June \u2014 more than six months later.\nBlakely told TheDC that to add insult to injury, even though he was initially assured by the VA that his medical bills would be covered, he\u2019s since been charged for his trip to the Methodist Hospital emergency room.\nEarlier in June, TheDC broke exclusively that in 2010, the same Memphis VA Medical Center approved over $1 million in bonuses while closing a therapy pool just a few months later citing a lack of funds. Bill O\u2019Reilly used that report as the basis of his \u201cIs it Legal\u201d segment the next day.\nA staffer at the House Veteran Affairs Committee told TheDC the committee was unaware of any other VA hospitals where outsourced medical tests were causing back logs."
