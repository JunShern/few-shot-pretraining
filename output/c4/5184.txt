    "text": "There have been a lot of mentions about this stock on social media and in the media in general such as CNBC etc. I am not surprised as it\u2019s been on a mission the last few weeks; however the recent peak could well have put in a significant peak, especially considering the media attention this stock has got recently.\nWhenever a stock or market gets highlighted, it\u2019s generally very close to a turn and usually close to high or low; in this case I can make a solid claim that there are enough gyrations to suggest the advance from the April 2018 lows has ended an impulse wave (5 wave rally).\nTo support the more bearish idea (Idea 1) and a large move lower to at least correct the advance from the April 2018 lows, then I would want to see a move below 24.90. The alternative idea that I am tracking (Idea 2), suggests the recent high is only that of a 3rd of 3rd wave and a few more gyrations as shown would be seen to extend the advance.\nHowever if we see a big move below 24.90, then I feel the depth of the decline would not be fitting with the prior gyrations and is likely part of a move lower for Idea 1.\nIf you own the stock you might want to pay attention to the area around 25.90 \u2013 26.00, in my opinion, any weakness should really find buyers if further upside is going to be seen for the alternative idea (Idea 2).\nIf history is a guide, then the recent high could be as significant as the prior 2 peaks.\nShort and long term analysis on US and European markets, various major FX pairs, commodities from Gold and silver to markets like natural gas.\nDaily analysis on where I think the market is going with key support and resistance areas, we move and adjust as the market adjusts.\nA chat room where members can discuss ideas with me or other members.\n*I have permission to post comments from the audio I hear from the S&P pits.\nIf you looking for quality analysis from someone that actually looks at multiple charts and works hard at providing members information to stay on the right side of the trends and making $$$, why not give the site a trial.\nIf any of the readers want to see this article in a PDF format.\nPlease put in the header PDF, or make it known that you want to be added to the mailing list for any future articles.\nOr if you have any questions about becoming a member, please use the email address above.\nIf you like what you see, or want to see more of my work, then please sign up for the 4 week trial.\nThis article is just a small portion of the markets I follow.\nI cover many markets, from FX to US equities, right the way through to commodities.\nIf I have the data I am more than willing to offer requests to members.\nCurrently new members can sign up for a 4 week free trial to test drive the site, and see if my work can help in your trading and if it meets your requirements.\nIf you don't like what you see, then drop me an email within the 1st 4 weeks from when you join, and ask for a no questions refund.\nYou simply have nothing to lose."
