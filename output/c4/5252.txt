Do ya'll use lens pouches inside your bags? It's been tough finding anything small enough for my kit lens or correctly sized for my 75-300... Any suggestions?\nI don't. Maybe I should?\nSo annoying that Oly's high end lenses do not include a pouch, let alone a hood. I like the quality of the pouches included with the PLs.\nDo your lenses bang up against each other? Or does your bag have a separate, neat pocket for each lens? Maybe I'm using the wrong bag!\nI've never used a lens pouch or anything like it in my whole life. I use LowePro bags, a Nova 190 these days, all the LowePro bags have compartments to fit the lenses. A lens pouch seems distinctly uncomfortable to me; I want to be able to take out a lens, take off the rear cap, exchange it with the one on the camera and put the rear cap back on the other one, within 10 seconds at the most. Almost all my lenses have a filter and lens hood permanently fitted, the Panny 7-14mm being the obvious exception.\nDo your lenses bang up against each other? Or does your bag have a separate, neat pocket for each lens?\nWell, no and no. My bad (regular shoulder bag, Lowepro nova 2aw) has 3 compartments, but in 2 of them I made additional separators (using Kata kit) so I can put in 5 lenses separated by padded material (much more padded than any pouch).\nI never do BTW have 5 lenses with me, but sometimes I even put a small lunch box into one of the compartments and use the remaining two for 2-3 lenses + cam.\nI have plenty of nice Olympus suede lens pouches from my Four-Thirds lenses. I don't need any more.\nI don't even use them anyways, unless I'm just transporting a single lens. My bag has inserts and padding and my only real problem with packing is not having enough space in the bags. Which extra pouches will only make worse. Plus I need quick access to my lenses.\nThe suede Olympus lens pouches and the lens bags for their bigger lenses are really sweet, though.\nI've got a few nice pouches from my Canon L lenses, but Would never use them. As the others have mentioned they are a pain when changing lenses. If I am carrying lenses in a bag that doesn't have a seperate compartment for every lens, I carry a couple of those small, synthetic, lint-free travel towels or similar and use them to keep the lenses seperate.\nIf you look on eBay for neoprene lens bags you'll find all sizes - should you still want to pursue that. Some also sell sets...about $2-3 each.\nI picked up a few of the neoprene pouches on ebay and they are surprisingly nice - but I almost never use them, except for a few of the bigger lenses I may throw into a back pack.\nThat way I can combine a longer and a shorter lens and maximize the use of the depth of my camera bags without things rattling around and scratching each other up.\nI've used a lot of both, bags with no inserts, and bags filled with inserts. Losing the inserts gives you a lot more space to hold a lot more, but it also makes setup and tear down of equipment a PAIN. It takes forever to constantly pack and unpack all your lenses, flash, etc. out of pouches, at least when you use as much as I do on a shoot. Having a pre-organized cubbie-filled bag uses up more space but will save you an incredible amount of time wasted out of your life. You can sit down and watch a tv episode at the end of the day, instead of returning home from a shoot too late to do anything but crash on the bed.\nI am a fan of double back caps, but not to carry two lenses in the bag. (Shamelessly promoting old post: https://www.mu-43.com/f67/shades-back-caps-commentary-6182/) Double back caps make changing lenses a two-handed affair rather than a three-handed one.\nI never use pouches with a bag. For me it is all about speed ... getting in and out of the the bag quickly is a principal concern. When I loan out lenses they always get packed in a bag.\nI like the idea of the socks. It's similar to what I use. Red and blue handkerchiefs. I only have one native lens which is mostly on the camera for carry. I mostly carry several Minolta lens which I wrap in red handkerchiefs. At present I also carry one M42 mount lens (Helios 44) in a blue handkerchief. It's easy to grab what you need and pull the wrap off. Incidentally, my bag is a fishing bag with some movable dividers. Works great."
