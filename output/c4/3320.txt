    "text": "Hello, friends. If you are a frequent visitor of my blog, you have most likely read lots of little stories about me and some of the happenings in my life. I enjoy sharing these stories. I enjoy writing. I enjoy having the opportunity to use my words and my stories to glorify God and His grace and His goodness.\nLately, these words have so strongly been placed in my heart and spirit. Words that started out as a whispering breeze are now turning into a strong wind. I know God is wanting me to do more than just tell my story, He is wanting me to tell His story. It is only in His story where redemption, love, and wholeness can be found.\nI began to ask\u2026where? How? I don\u2019t really know where God is leading me in all of this. I am a homeschool stay-at-home mom. I have little to no adult interaction in an average day. What can I do? Daily, He is gently reminding me not to put Him in a box.\nGod is not constrained to our own perceived limitations.\nI am starting here, with you. God has not revealed a \u201cbig and grand\u201d plan. I just know I should start with what He has given me. I may not be a fantastic writer, but I can usually put together some sort of comprehensible sentence. Usually. I don\u2019t have any sort of \u201cfollowing\u201d, but, I have been given a love for writing; I will use the love that I was given for writing to point it right back to The Giver.\nI am starting a new series of posts on here that reflect on the call \u201cto go\u201d. What it means, what it looks like in our every day lives, what we can do to follow the words of Christ. However, don\u2019t for a minute believe that I am an expert in this\u2026far from it.\nI want to share what I learn, as I learn.\nI won\u2019t be the only one posting about this. I will be inviting others to join with me on this topic and post their experiences and share how they are following this call \u201cto go\u201d. One of the most frequent people you will find here posting about this will be my youngest brother, Matthew.\n\u201cAs a marketing student, I am constantly doing case studies to better the marketing efforts of non-existent companies. There is always a process my professors have me go through for each project. While this sounds completely unrelated and monotonous, please just hear me out.\nThe first step is to know what your strategy is. This is the overarching point of the entire marketing plan. Everything that follows is meant to attain and fulfill this purpose. The next step is to set specific goals/objectives that are measurable and fit into reaching the strategy. Finally, you have your tactics for how you will reach these goals. These are the practical steps on how you will actually carry out the entire project.\nWhy do I mention these steps? Because they are very practical in the way we conduct our lives as Christians. We are a culture of compartmentalization.\nI have my class time, my homework time, my various social times, my church time; all of these are things I separate as different tasks. While they all are unique and different, there should be an overarching purpose to which they all contribute. These are the tactics, so to speak.\nI am taking six classes this semester in order to reach one of my objectives of graduating from college. The purpose in this is so that I can use my degree to move overseas and work with people who don\u2019t have the Gospel among them. This is how doing my homework, showing up for class, and paying my tuition are all tactics that contribute to the end purpose of my life.\nHowever, we as Christians often have a disconnect between tactic and strategy.\nIn the myriad of daily commitments, we so often treat them as if they are the end goal for us. Maybe it\u2019s because of a lack of energy, an overcrowded schedule, or a lack of vision; no matter what it is, we all struggle with seeing the daily, weekly, and monthly tasks (tactics) as reaching an objective to accomplish a Gospel purpose. Because of this, we make unbiblical separations in our lives. We live with a mindset that there is a certain time of the day (or week) where we are to be Gospel-driven.\nSo, here we are, two people with a set purpose to further understand and live out the call \u201cto go\u201d, daily, as Gospel-centered individuals. We are excited to share this journey with you. Our goal is not to make ourselves feel like \u201cbetter Christians\u201d, but instead, to fan the flames of the Gospel message to all people."
