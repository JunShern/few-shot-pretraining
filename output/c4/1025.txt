    "text": "Lynn Blake, left, teaches two hospital employees CPR at the VVMC Safety Fair. Blake\u00e2\u0080\u0099s passion for educating Eagle County residents came from her own Sudden Cardiac Arrest, which a bystander provided CPR and saved her life. She was just 27 at the time.\nOn Valentine\u2019s Day 2007, Lynn Blake was embarking on a new job in Vail Village when she had a rude awakening. The 27-year-old suffered sudden cardiac arrest. Fortunately for her, someone trained in CPR stepped forward and kept her heart beating until emergency personnel arrived with a defibrillator. If someone dropped in front of you unconscious, with no notable pulse, would you know what to do? Some 325,000 people die every year of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) in the United States. And, contrary to popular belief, it strikes people of all ages. \u201cI did not know a thing about cardiac arrest. I didn\u2019t know what it was,\u201d Blake said. Now she knows firsthand about sudden cardiac arrest. The more she found out, the more she wondered why more people weren\u2019t educated about SCA, the leading causes of death in the U.S. Just a few months after Blake\u2019s sudden cardiac arrest, area pro biker Mike Janelle, in the prime of his life, died of SCA.\u201dIt\u2019s a lot more common than people realize,\u201d Blake said. Yet, she found, \u201cno one\u2019s really educating people about cardiac arrest.\u201d That\u2019s why she founded the Starting Hearts Foundation, partnering with the Vail Valley Medical Center and area emergency services. Starting Hearts is a non-profit dedicated to saving the lives of SCA victims, through communitywide CPR and AED (Automated External Defibrillation) education and access. \u201cVail Valley Medical Center embraces Lynn\u2019s mission,\u201d said Doris Kirchner, CEO and president of Vail Valley Medical Center. \u201cVVMC is in the business of saving lives, and Starting Hearts can have a direct impact on that mission by engaging the community to help recognize and react to SCA appropriately.\u201d Community key to saving lives Nearly 60 percent of cardiac arrests are witnessed. Most people know to call 911. But if that\u2019s all you know about saving someone from SCA, the victim\u2019s chance of surviving is slim. It is estimated 95 percent of cardiac arrest victims die before reaching a hospital if they do not receive shock treatment, such as from a defibrillator. That is why the response of bystanders is so critical to saving lives. Yet, Blake found the vast majority of people aren\u2019t trained in CPR or using an AED. CPR classes tend to be taken only by those in jobs that demand the skill. Even if a layperson struggles to find a nearby course, it is difficult, Blake explains. Finding an AED is no easy task either. To address these issues, Starting Hearts acquired a decommissioned bus, and created the HeartRod, a mobile CPR/AED training unit, sponsored by Vail Valley Medical Center. Now, Blake, a certified instructor, travels to community events, Eagle County Schools and businesses teaching CPR and AED classes. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t going to come to me; I need to be able to go to them,\u201d Blake said.Blake also created the event \u201cAll You Need is Heart,\u201d which will take place on Feb. 14 at The Sebastian in Vail. The event focuses on personal heart health, including more than $1,200 worth of heart screens such as EKG\u2019s, ultrasounds and cholesterols test. There are also feature presentations on endurance sports and the affects of high altitude, overcoming life\u2019s challenges and savings lives in Eagle County. The event is $150 per person and is a fundraiser for Starting Hearts Foundation. Save more livesStarting Hearts will launch the ambitious \u201cSave More Lives\u201d campaign. \u201cOur goal is to annually educate 25,000 people in Eagle County,\u201d in CPR and AED, Blake said. As part of the campaign, Blake decided to apply the type of lessons every child has grasped. \u201cIf you ask anyone what to do if they catch on fire, they\u2019d respond, \u2018stop, drop and roll.\u2019 Starting Hearts came up with a similar unforgettable message for SCA: \u2018Call, push and shock.'\u201d Dr. Lawrence Gaul is the Starting Hearts medical director. He was the cardiologist who treated Blake when she came into the Vail Valley Medical Center during her cardiac arrest episode. \u201cIt\u2019s simple,\u201d Gaul said, explaining Call, push and shock. \u201cCall 911. Do rapid compressions in the middle of the chest and shock the person. When someone has a cardiac arrest the most important thing needed is shock.\u201d That\u2019s why, over the next year, the Save More Lives campaign will focus during on placing portable AEDs in strategic public places around Eagle County so anyone can find the nearest AED in emergencies.When Dr. Gaul traveled to Monaco for a medical conference, he was surprised to see this tiny country filled with street signs everywhere pointing to the nearest AED. By 2015, when the World Cup arrives in the Vail Valley, Dr. Gaul and Starting Hearts hope to have AEDs similarly available.To Blake, it is most rewarding when someone comes and tells her one of the classes she taught made a difference. There was the lady who took her class and was able to remove an object stuck in the throat of her choking grandchild through CPR. And the little girl who took one of her courses through the Youth Foundation and went home and practiced CPR with her family. \u201cI encourage everyone in this community to get involved and participate in the Save More Lives campaign,\u201d Blake said. \u201cIf everyone gets involved, we really can do it.\u201dTo participate in Save More Lives, find out about CPR and AED classes or to donate, contact Starting Hearts by emailing lynn@startinghearts.org or calling 970-331-3983."
