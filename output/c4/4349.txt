    "text": "HomeNews & InformationLove Youself, You Will Drive In A Better Life.\nThe reason we fight daily with our insecurity is because we compare ourselves to everyone around us!\nEvery day and at any age is very easy to mix up our lives with the lives of other people.Social media, selfies, photos, filters, video, fabulous destinations, beautiful beaches, incredible food, they take a life perfect fairytale, fantastic. Everyone you imagine has a fantastic, stunning life without any difficulties, ailments, problems, and for many of us makes our lives look miserable, pale in relation to what we see around us.\nThe problem with all that I write above is that we compare our real daily life with its problems with the best moments of the life of our peoples. We do not even know if this is real or it is happening at some point,a feeling of unsatisfaction,no motivation for our lives, and finally it brings depression. \u201cIf my life is not as good as their own, why should I try\u201d the question that dominates us.\nEach of us is different, with different preferences, values and focus on life. If our life was the same, you would still not be happy because what givessomeone another joy very well can not make you feel the same. You may want the body of another person and the finances of someone else, andultimately the life of someone else. THIS IS NOT REALISTIC.\nYou are an amazing, unique person with gifts given to him by the nature no one else has. Cultivating these gifts and talents and finding your purpose in life will make you much happier than trying to become someone else or comparing your situation with another person. Just think, from this day look ahead, you can choose to go, do or be anything you want. You must be prepared to do this with time and effort.\nReduce the time you spend on social media, it takes time from your real goal and makes the rest of the world look better than it really is.\n2.Take time to improve yourself.It is not too late to learn, to mature and to become better people. Be the best in your work by enriching your knowledge, finding a specialist and getting better in your body, planning a trip which you always wanted to do or put a new goal on the project that will make your life more attractive.\nBegin to be grateful for your life, sometimes we must remind ourselves that we are blessed for what we have. There are people around you who love what you have.\nBecome a volunteer for something good, do good and help other people this will definitely make you feel good, plus it is certain the universe will return it back!\nLearn to use the positive thoughts in your head to overcome the negative voices, tell yourself that you are already what you want to become and become.\nIn conclusion, your concern is to compare yourself with yourself. Become better everyday at all levels, growing up you need to continually improve by making good choices and changing small habits that lead to big changes. You have the power, believe in yourself, love it, it is your best friend, your fellow traveler in life, you just have to learn to use it to make your life better."
