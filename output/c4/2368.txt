When he knows what the object is, he nods.\nThen the third person repeats the process, and the object is mimed in this fashion down the line to the last person.\nThe objective of the game is that pantomime of the object is clear enough each time so that it stays the same object all the way down the line.\nUsually, the object changes into something entirely different \u2013 the interesting thing is to see how it changed along the line.\nEach person should tell the rest of the line what she thought the object was, and discuss what she saw her partner demonstrating.\nVariations: There are many variations that can be played with this game, by changing the object to a movie or book title, or incorporating concepts from a curricular area into the game. For example, the pantomime could be of a part of speech (preposition) or a science concept (gravity).\nThe game requires a lot of silence and patience from participants; keep your students\u2019 limits in mind when dividing a class into groups.\nMake sure the objects are ones that the participants are likely to have used or seen used often enough that they don\u2019t get stuck trying to figure out how the thing works. For example, a photocopier is near and dear to the hearts of teachers, but kids don\u2019t have many opportunities to use them."
