    "text": "It\u2019s been awhile. I\u2019m always so shocked when I let some time go by without posting and realize that a few months have gone by, if not more. Life just keeps on keepin\u2019 on.\nWhile life hasn\u2019t changed too drastically, I do have some big news to share that will make life interesting here in the next three weeks: my husband accepted an internship in the Silicon Valley area of California! The opportunity fell right into his lap \u2013 literately. Good ol\u2019 LinkedIn came through via a recruiter who liked what he saw on Dan\u2019s profile page so several interviews were set up, and before we knew it, a large tech firm had extended a nice offer to Dan the following week. Prior to being recruited, Dan was not even considering internships out of the state for the sole reason that we wanted to stay in our wonderful city for at least the foreseeable future. Although, I am familiar with moving around a little bit. My parents were in the military and with that commitment came periodic moves. We were blessed in that we only moved around about three times, but I moved around quite a bit in my early 20s. Each time uprooting my life and leaving my friends for something new. Change is good, but big city life suites me well, and I can\u2019t imagine living anywhere else. Any time I take a trip to suburban areas or even back home I immediately miss my life in the big city.\nDan and I spoke about the California opportunity for several weeks, trying to figure out how we would make it work, and we soon settled on Dan accepting the offer. The company is giving Dan a small housing stipend, but it was our job to find him temporary housing. This part was immensely stressful, but we eventually found a room for him via Airbnb. I did some background research on the host, reviewed reviewers comments, and Skyped with him later. I feel comfortable with the decision, and I pray that everything runs smoothly. Holy cow though, California is EXPENSIVE! I could not believe the rental prices leasing reps were quoting me. I started looking at corporate housing and extended stay hotels, but I just could not justify the cost \u2013 the idea is save a large chunk of the money Dan will be earning while he\u2019s out there.\nThe funny thing about Dan\u2019s internship is that we have been talking about taking a vacation in California for years! I have never been so I am so excited to get to see the West coast. One of my most favorite movies is Sideways, and I would give anything to see the Hitching Post and Napa Valley. I\u2019ve already booked time off from work to visit Dan in the beginning of July for around 9 days, but that will probably be the only time I get to see him until his internship ends. My heart grows heavy when I think about him not being here with me for the whole summer, but I\u2019m leaning on God to get me through the nights when I miss him more than I can bear. I\u2019m thankful for my friends, and all the summer festivities we\u2019ve got planned already. I intend to use a busy schedule and lots of prayer to divert my attention from missing my husband.\nI\u2019m also coming up on my one year anniversary at work. I can\u2019t believe it! I still remember the sheer elation I felt when this offer came through, and I\u2019m still very content with my decision to accept the offer. I still like the non-traditional approach I\u2019ve taken to working in law, and I\u2019ve enjoyed working with my sweet co-workers. I\u2019ve always been flexible in my approach on life. I would like to stay where we are for at least the foreseeable future, but I can\u2019t be certain of that until Dan is finished with school. There\u2019s always the possibility that he\u2019ll snag an offer that he\u2019s incredibly excited about after he graduates in a year outside of the state. I want to support Dan just as he\u2019s supported me so we\u2019ll see where life takes us if that decision comes up in the future. The idea of sitting for another bar exam is nauseating, but we\u2019ll cross that bridge if it comes upon us.\nIn other news, my cool, RV-traveling parents are in Iowa as I write this, and I think I\u2019m finally going to get to see them this summer! I\u2019m ashamed to say that I have not seen my parents in at least two years. I miss my mom deeply so I\u2019m excited that they\u2019re at least within driving distance.\nI also went on my first extended stay camping trip in Michigan! It was so wonderful. There are no words to explain what an amazing time I had just chilling with some truly amazing friends, cooking dinner over the fire, singing worship songs over the gentle plucking of an acoustic guitar and laughing until tears ran down my face. More than anything, it was nice to escape for a weekend and to recharge. I think everyone needs to get away every once in awhile. It was just what I needed!\nI hope life is treating you well, readers!\nNext Post Cleaning Schedule \u2013 Is There Such a Thing?"
