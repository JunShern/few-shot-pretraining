    "text": "Wrong-way crashes can produce catastrophic injuries | Breslin & Breslin, P.A.\nHead-on crashes mean that two vehicles going full speed smash each other. The impact of this is much greater than a similar accident involving two vehicles that are going the same way. When you are traveling in the same direction as the car that slams into you, the force of the impact will be reduced a bit.\nIn some cases, head-on wrecks are fatal. Even if the victims don't pass away from the injuries, there is a good chance that they will have to deal with negative impacts like catastrophic injuries. These include spinal and brain damage that can leave lifelong impacts on the person.\nPeople who are involved in a wreck with a wrong-way driver might decide to seek compensation. This can help negate the horrible financial aspects of this type of crash. Not only do you have to pay for the influx of medical bills that you are getting now because of the crash, but you also have to think about what other financial damages you have. For example, if you are having to miss work, we are able to seek out recompense for that. We will work closely with you to determine what types of damages you have suffered so we can count those in the filing."
