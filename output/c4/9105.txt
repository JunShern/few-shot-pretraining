    "text": "Organizations implementing the requirements of ISO Management System standards [MSS] viz. ISO 9001; ISO 14001; ISO 22301; ISO 27001; ISO 45001; ISO 50001 etc. mean that customers availing their products and services can have confidence that they are safe, reliable and of good quality and in compliance with the applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. ISO\u2019s standards on various Management Systems help make the world a safer place. Regulators and governments count on ISO standards to help develop better regulation, knowing they have a sound basis thanks to the involvement of globally-established experts.\n\u2013 Mandatory if you want to tender for some public-sector work.\nNotwithstanding this significant awareness there is still utter of lack of awareness among the manufacturers of goods & services. No doubt, the entrepreneurs that are already ISO certified undergo frequent renewals and re-certifications, many others are still lagging and fail to go for an ISO certification.\nExcess Theory: Often to attain a desirable MSS, organizations often tend to emphasize on theory than practical implementation. It should be kept in mind that due implementation of a MSS adds real value to an organisation.\nMere Documentation: Often companies tend to focus too much on documentation and criteria for the certification, sometimes at the cost of their normal operation. This further impedes the implementation of ISO certification process. As a wise manager, one should include only the most crucial documentation and at the right time.\nLack of Flexibility: Too much rigidity also impedes implementation and improvement. This is noticed in the case of technological upgrading. Very importantly, customer preferences are constantly changing. Thus, the MSS must also evolve accordingly.\nLack of Attention To The Consumers: Sometimes, in an attempt to reach the desired levels, the organizations tend to ignore the customer preferences. One must not forget that customer satisfaction is the basis of achievement of an MSS Certification.\nExcess Competition: In many cases, it has been seen that the competitive spirit in some organizations goes overboard. Sometimes, this reduces motivation. Instead, they must focus on client satisfaction.\nThe Auditor/ Lead Auditor Training Programs are accredited by International Register of Certificated Auditors [IRCA].\nIRCA is the leading professional body for management system auditors. IRCA represents over 10,000 registered auditors in 150 countries and every year, around 60,000 delegates attend an IRCA approved training course.\nInternationally recognized [IRCA accredited] certificate for Lead Auditor of the respective ISO Management Systems issued by Intertek upon successful completion of the course.\nISO 9001:2015 is the international standard that specifies requirements for a quality management system (QMS).\nISO 22301:2012 Business Continuity Management System.\nISO 22301 Business Continuity Management Systems certification guides a company.\nThe ISO 27001:2013 is a specification for an information security management system best known (ISMS).\nISO 14001:2015 is a Standard to help Companies Reduce Industrial Waste and Environment Management System Damage.\nISO 50001 supports organizations in all sectors to use energy more efficiently, through the development of an energy management system."
