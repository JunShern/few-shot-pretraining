These methods work best when the stain is fresh, but if you have moved into a property with old stains on the carpet, try these methods first, then call us in to remove them using our #Texatherm process for you.\nMethod: First, scrape up excess with a blunt knife, then use a Dry-Cleaning Solution followed by Detergent Vinegar Solution and blot dry. See below for final rinse procedure.\npour mixture into a spray bottle and spray over the stained area.\nSpread white kitchen towel (stacked 6-8 sheets deep) or absorbent cloth over the affected area and place a weight, such as a telephone directory, on top.\nOf course, without knowing the precise make-up of your carpet, or the age and the size of the spill, we can\u2019t guarantee this will work, but it should solve most stains for you. If you can\u2019t shift the stain, call us in to have a look and give you more specific advice, or a free quote to do it for you. We cover Leicester City and all Leicestershire Towns."
