Thomas\u2019 new single, \u201cSo Many Girls,\u201d is a mere taste of what\u2019s to come for the actor turned musician.\nQ - Thank you, Khleo, for taking the time. How are you doing?\nA - No, thank you. I\u2019m feeling great, working hard and seeing the benefits of it. Loving it!\nQ - You were named one of AOL's Film Fixation\u2019s \u201cBlack Stars Rising: 10 Young African-Americans to Watch.\u201d How did you get involved in acting and was it something that you\u2019ve always wanted to do?\nA - Acting is a passion of mine. I told my mom at the age of five that acting is what I wanted to do. I really enjoy being able to turn into somebody else; it\u2019s a creative thing.\nQ - You\u2019ve appeared in films such as \u201cWalking Tall\u201d with The Rock and Disney\u2019s \u201cHoles\u201d with Shia LaBeouf and Sigourney Weaver. What did you learn from working with these big named stars?\nA - I learned that being a humble kid, no matter what, was going to get me a long way. They all respected that I understood I was on the set to work. Because of that, I was looked at as a fellow actor, and not just a kid on set.\nQ - Other projects you\u2019ve been a part of were the hit series, \u201cSons of Anarchy\u201d and \u201cHurricane Season,\u201d where you starred opposite acting legend, Forest Whitaker. Of all the big names and projects you\u2019ve been a part of, which one stood out the most to you and why?\nA - Definitely Forest. He's an incredible actor who has perfected his craft in more ways than one. It is great to analyze legends.\nQ - Like many actors, you\u2019ve segued into a career in music. Describe your music for those who aren\u2019t familiar with it.\nA - Music has always been a passion as well. I wrote the theme song for the movie \u201cHoles\u201d when I was 13. My music is something that grabs you no matter what. It is the overall sound of having something you won\u2019t expect from me.\nQ - The new single is called, \u201cSo Many Girls\u201d and the upcoming EP is called, \u201cCall Back.\u201d What can fans expect from the upcoming album?\nQ - Will there be a tour as well?\nA - Yes, I\u2019m actually working on that right now."
