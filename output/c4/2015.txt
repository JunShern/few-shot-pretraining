His words, tone and ideology as presented in the speech, were the reflection of his personality that transforms him in one of the most successful Presidents and leaders in the world. Some of the major aspects that showed him as a true leader include: being democratic in his approach, motivational in talks, envisioned and being highly job oriented.\nObama showed that he is one of the most democratic leader as he is capable of delegating authority to others, encourages participation, relies on subordinates\u2019 knowledge for completion of tasks, and depends on subordinate respect for influence. This can be observed when he stated that \u201cTonight this chamber speaks with one voice to the people we represent: It is you, our citizens, who make the state of our union strong.\u201d This shows that his subordinates and all the involved stakeholders are equally important for him in accomplishing his desired goals and targets."
