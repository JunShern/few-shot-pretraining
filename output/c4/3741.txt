    "text": "If you work construction, accidents are more likely to happen than if you worked an office job (though of course, accidents happen there too).\nJob sites are fraught with opportunities to trip and fall. Uneven, slippery surfaces are the most likely culprit, but sometimes the very devices that are there for your safety could be at fault, such as improperly constructed scaffolding, faulty or worn safety harnesses, ladders that aren\u2019t securely anchored, etc.\nSuch \u201cmoving objects\u201d could include a tool dropped from an overhead platform or scaffold, a stray nail or staple ejected from a pneumatic tool, collapsed masonry, or even a vehicle whose driver didn\u2019t properly set an emergency brake or take proper care in driving through a work area.\nPower lines are always one of the biggest concerns when seeking to prevent construction accidents, because this type of hazard can be hanging overhead or hiding underground. In addition, tools that require electricity must be properly grounded, or anyone in the immediate vicinity is at risk.\nThese types of construction accidents are the definition of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. This category includes getting caught under unsecured heavy machinery, unstable piles of materials such as gravel, and deep trench cave-ins.\nConstruction accidents often result in serious injuries such as concussion, limbs that require amputation, blindness, deafness, paralysis, permanent scarring, and death. Survivors often find that their ability to make a living in the future is impacted. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to keep all your records in order and consult an attorney as soon as possible after construction accidents.\nConsult with the lawyers at Pat Maloney. We\u2019ll help you make the best comeback possible."
