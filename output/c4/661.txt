    "text": "I am going to be looking at a 95 Casita Freedom Deluxe this week. the owner says that it has not been camped in for four years, his grand kids use it for a play house, it has the original anti-freeze put in it four years ago, he has sent photos and they look great as if the casita has hardly been used ai all, howevwer we know this is not true as it is a 95, I asked him to do a check of the fridge. battery, water heater, water flow to the bath, and sink, air cond, and the tires, his check turned out positive, everything works OK however he stated he would consider new tires as the Carlisles are four years old but not showing wear or signs of cracking, my question is what might I look for in a Casita that has been sitting for four years without use. I don't know if it has a hot water tank by-pass or if they put 6 Gal. of anti-freeze in the tank, I think there has to be a lot of unanswered questions, from visual indications it looks like it is worth the $6,500 he is asking. but I sure don't want to get in over my head with a lot of costly problems from the Casita just sitting idle four years, What are some of the things I should look for, if any one has any knowledge or experience or just suggestions along these lines I would certainly appreciate your thoughts.\ni got into trouble with that when i switched from a full size trucks---there is much crazy discussion about what i went thru but there is one good thread on tow weight in the real world that might help.\nDefinitely worth taking with you.\nGet under it, check for frame rust, cracks, etc.\nUsed glass trailers tend to see quickly if they are in good shape so don't ponder to long it it's a gem!\nSorry meant to type, IF its a gem! Geezzzzz, I should proof read before I hit post!"
