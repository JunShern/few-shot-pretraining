    "text": "The Noriker or Noric horse is one of the oldest mountain draft horses in Europe, originating in the foothills of the highest Austrian mountains, Grossglockner, and being indigenous to the Central Alpine regions. Initially used for transporting a lot of goods from one place to the other, they are immensely popular in the present times because of its pleasant temperament, surefootedness, and agility.\nColors Bay, black and chestnut are the basic coat colors, they also appear in a variety of other striking colors like roan, blue roan, overos, tobianos, as well as the spotted leopard complex.\nHealth Though it has no known breed-related health problems, proper care, and regular health checkups is essential.\nPopular Traits Well-balanced, sure-footed; agile; possesses climbing ability.\nThese horses attain their name from Noricum, a Celtic kingdom and a province of the Roman Empire. According to the data provided by the International Encyclopedia of Horse Breeds in the year 1995, their breeding began in Thessaly, a region in Greece, which was also famous for developing war horses. They were said to be the heaviest breed created for this purpose. After the fall of the Greeks, the Romans, who excelled in the art of horse breeding, setting up stud farms in their kingdom, continued the tradition of developing the Noriker horses. However, the role of Romans in creating these horses is still a matter of question as according to certain proven artifacts these horses were said to exist as early as the first millennium before Christ era, used for transportation and trading through the Alps Mountains. Since as early as this time up to the nineteenth century they played a pivotal role in enhancing trade between the Central part of Europe and the Adriatic region. In fact, they were used for carrying a variety of goods like Celtic iron, salt, and gold while journeying from Salzburg to Italy, whereas, on returning they would bring along with them spices and wine. During the 20th century, as industrialization set in, they began to be used for agricultural purpose. At present, they have emerged as fabulous sport horses also being well-suited for children to handle.\nVulkan-Line: This line is the most popular one with the founder stallions as well as their descendants represent the heavy draft horse kind.\nNero-Line: The Noriker stallion, 1378 Stoissen-Nero V/977, foaled in the year 1931 was a part of this line.\nDiamant \u2013Line: This line began during the first part of the 20th century, and the horses belonging to this line were agile.\nSchaunitz \u2013Line: Horses hailing from this line in the present times are small-sized along with proper movements.\nElmar-Line: The influence of the baroque horses are seen in breeds belonging to this line as most of them possess a unique coat color along with a smaller-stature and lighter build. The leopard spotted coat color is also visible.\nThe Noriker horse is an integral part of the Kufenstechen, a traditional festival in the Feistritz an der Gail region of Austria, where young men who are unmarried ride on the back of these horses and attempt to hit on a wooden barrel using an iron hammer.\nThough historically known as the Pinzgauer they underwent a name change by the end of the nineteenth century because of the Romanophile attitude, after which they were called as Noriker horse.\nThe Pinzgauer High-Mobility All-Terrain Vehicle was named after this breed."
