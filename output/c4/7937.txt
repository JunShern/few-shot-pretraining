Select your state below.\nHave you ever heard the adage, \u201cIf you bought it, a truck brought it\u201d? That\u2019s never been more true than right now. According to Wikipedia, over 80 percent of all communities in the U.S. rely exclusively on trucks to bring all of their clothing, food, fuel, medicine, and other consumer goods. In May of 2013, the Bureau of Transportation Statistics estimated that the trucking industry alone carried more than 60% of the roughly $98 billion worth of freight transported between the United States, Canada, and Mexico. When it comes to bulk freight transportation, no other mode of transportation even comes close!\nIf you are contemplating becoming a professional truck driver, you have chosen the right career field. In fact, with the shortage of truckers at an all-time low, and the trucking industry job market continuing to grow at a steady pace, there\u2019s never been a better time to pursue a career in truck driving than right now. The U.S. Bureau of Labor statistics has reported that the employment of heavy and tractor trailer truck drivers is expected to grow by 11 percent from 2012 to 2022, with over 1.5 million trucking jobs as of 2013. The median salary for a professional truck driver was $40,940 per year and $19.68 per hour. As the weak U.S. economy continues to strengthen, the demand for goods, and those who transport those goods, will continue to grow.\nSo, how exactly do you become part of the driving force behind this ever important multi-billion dollar industry? Simple. All you need is a commercial drivers license (CDL), adequate physical health, and the ability to operate a commercial motor vehicle. How do I go about obtaining my CDL, you may ask. Well, that\u2019s where things start to get interesting. You essentially have two options. You can go through company sponsored training, in which a truck driving company sends you to a truck driving school of their choice and pays for your cdl training. You will have to pay back the school loan by working for the company who sponsored your schooling once you graduate. That\u2019s right. There\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch and the trucking industry is no exception. Your second option is to attend a private truck driving school and pay for the schooling yourself. This is the option that most people choose because you can choose exactly which school you would like to attend and, after you graduate, you will have the freedom to work for any company that hires inexperienced truck drivers. Be advised though, private truck driving schools will require you to pay the full tuition up front. Most truck driving students pay their tuition through school loans, grants, and other forms of financial aid.\nLet\u2019s say you choose option two. Your next question will most likely be, how do I go about choosing the truck driving school that is best for me? Good question. Here are some suggestions. First, decide if you will be attending school full-time, or part-time while you work. Ideally, you would want to attend school full-time so you could put all of your time and energy into your schooling. Next, decide if you want to attend a school that is local or attend a school where you will have to live away from home. Obviously, the latter will be more expensive, since you will have to pay for your own living expenses until you graduate.\nOnce you have narrowed your list down to a few schools, do some research and call the schools you are contemplating on attending. There are a few questions you may want to ask. How long is their truck driver training program? Is it only a few weeks or is it a few months? Do your best to avoid \u201cCDL mills\u201d that promise to have you certified in \u201ctwo short weeks\u201d. Ask them what their average class size is. If possible, you want to choose a truck driving school with smaller classes, say, around ten to fifteen students per class. That way, you are more likely to have all your questions answered and the instructors will be able to devote more time to each student. How do they train their students during the hands-on portion of the program. Is it one-on-one training, or two, three, or four students in the truck cab at a time? How old or new are the school\u2019s trucks? Dirty used trucks are one thing but, old and outdated trucks are not what you want to be training on. Do the trucks have standard or automatic transmissions? You may also want to see if the school has a job placement program that aids their graduates in finding a good trucking job. Is the school accredited by the Better Business Bureau or certified by the Professional Truck Driving Institute? Write down as many questions as you can so that you will be fully equipped when you call the school. Keep in mind that most truck driving schools have two objectives. Their first objective is to give you the information and training you need to pass the CDL knowledge and skills tests, and their second objective is to teach you how to operate a commercial motor vehicle in a safe, competent, and responsible manner.\nHopefully, this information will help you get one step closer to achieving your goal of becoming a successful truck driver. Remember, the journey on the road to a successful and fulfilling truck driving career is traveled one mile at a time!"
