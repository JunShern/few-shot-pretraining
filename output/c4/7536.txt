    "text": "I continue to be creating in fabric lately. The digital part is documenting what I am doing.\nI have a collector gene and sewing seems to fill that as well. There is the fabric hunt and acquisition. The tools and accessories. The patterns and the products. And then the set up and the organization. It really does fill so many spaces.\nOrganizing and creating rhythms and processes is necessary. I now have a command hook on the side of my sewing machine with my tail cutting scissors. Practicing using and putting back and always knowing where it is.\nI used a letter sorter for hold my rulers. A vintage creamer and sugar bowl for my fabric clips. Bed risers on my table to raise it so it is comfortable for cutting and sitting at on a counter stool for assembly.\nNext was the presser feet that came with my machine. the little plastic pouch was useless. I got an inexpensive plastic bead box and added labels. So far works great!\nBobbins \u2013 I started with a small plastic case. Each time I opened and took on out \u2013 they all came out and landed all over the room. And the tails \u2013 ugh!. I used some Amazon points and got some huggers for my spools and a BobbinSaver \u2013 a plastic ring that holds the bobbins. So far it is a huge improvement.\nI have found a mentor to help me thru things. A smart and talented woman who does fantastic work \u2013 but with reality mixed in. She knows how to get to quality \u2013 but get the job done. Can\u2019t thank her enough for taking me under her wing. We have some similar interests and she is so generous in her sharing and help online. LOL \u2013 she has chickens and roosters and one of her favorite fabric subjects are rooters\u2026under her wing \u2013 \u2014 get it? LOL She is also a Flash WonderWoman! She can make 2 dozen feed sack totes in a day! Check her out at Grammies Little Aprons and Sew Much More on Facebook.\nI am not looking to expand into selling lots of things and having to keep an inventory. But I am going to need an outlet to move some of the creations on. I already know I have more than I can use. I am exploring options.\ning to earn living or make a fortune.\nI met a vintage crafter online who was moving her MIL\u2019s estate and purchased (very reasonably!) some Christmas tablecloths and a floral. The floral is dynamic. Not a favorite of mine, but it makes a statement. I worked on some interfacing combinations and some other things and created a nice size tote. Not as large as I had done \u2013 so actually more useful.\nI was pleased with the results. I didn\u2019t have dark pink thread on hand and didn\u2019t edge the handles. My mentor was quick to point that out. I went ahead anyways.\nThere was still fabric left. I wanted to do a different style bag. Since I am not in a mass production cycle \u2013 I am more apt to create different bags for many reasons. One to keep improving my skills and two I don\u2019t know what to do with them now \u2013 why would I have dozens of the same thing in different patterns. If I was doing craft shows or mass market, one type might work. For now I am creating one of a kind and limited designs.\nSo from this fabric I got a \u201cHappy Bag\u201d. A bag with a large \u201csmile\u201d pocket on the front.\nI had to go to the vet today for meds for our Jaxin. It was a Saturday and there is this place near by called Northwinds Junk Post that I have wanted to explore. They are only open on weekends and it is 35 miles away \u2013 today was the day!\nI was fortunate to find some seed sack cloth yardage. A little dirty \u2013 but cleaned up well. I can\u2019t wait to use it as lining or as a bag itself. I will now be able to create an entire end product with vintage cloth!\nAll cleaned and folded for storage until used.\nAnd now I need to find LARGE vintage buttons and other doo dads!!! Lynn Prey \u2013 help!!! What do I look for and what are good prices?\nFor being in Wisconsin in the winter \u2013 things are feeling good and creating is going on.\nFinished the vintage camel cloth into a tote bag.\nAdded a pocket panel on the inside.\nFeeling pretty good about this one. :-). No pattern \u2013 just math, some techniques and construction things I finally was able to do smoothly. Improvement on my edge stitching. Using up fabric and repurposing fabric that may have went to the landfill.\nWell I seem to be in a hands on fabric creation mode vs. digital right now. Seems okay with me.\nI soaked the cloth in several baths over a couple of days and then put it thru a wash cycle. It is clean now \u2013 but probably lighter than original. I like that it is a little brighter.\nI had been at the Sewing Basket during a skinny bolt sale and found the green and gold print. There was a yard left and it seemed to be calling. I was extremely pleased when I got home and found it was a good match.\nMy mind had the piece destined to be a bag for better use in it\u2019s next iteration. The colors and subject would make it difficult to use as a wall hanging without a specific person in mind that would find it a fit.\nI am trying to NOT become a fabric hoarder and use as much as have and only get what I know I will use soon. The basket weave print is from when I was making things for my grandson\u2019s nursery that didn\u2019t get used.\nthe panel was gifted to me by Judy S. Some soaking and cleaning brought out the colors. I was able to find some fabric that was perfect to go along.\nI stabilized the tapestry and then backed ti with a cotton to create the binding.\nNext it was adding it to the background.\nThe binding fabric is what I will use for the lining.\nThe bag will end up being about 20X16.\nLearning to stop when I am tired so I don\u2019t get sloppy.\nI am excited to see how this will turn out!"
