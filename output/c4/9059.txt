    "text": "Looking to redecorate or redesign your apartment, but tight on space and/or you are at the mercy of a landlord?\nLooking for more advice and inspiration designed with your small home in mind? Take a look at our small spaces hub page.\nWhen you are living in an apartment that has been generously labelled as a 'studio', there are only so many mirrors you can hang to 'bounce light around' or multi-functional furniture you can buy to 'maximise space'.\nThe key thing is just to be realistic about how much you can actually fit into your apartment and make everything you do choose really space-efficient. For example, do you really need a kitchen table? Or will a breakfast bar or a handy kitchen island with more kitchen storage be a better use of space?\nFind more inspiration in our storage ideas for small kitchens.\nBefore you buy, re-envision what you already have. Refocusing the layout could allow you to update a rented apartment without splashing out.\nTry floating your furniture \u2013 just because your apartment might be on the small side, it doesn\u2019t mean that everything has to hug the walls. If you are working with a studio apartment, you can also use furniture to make distinctions between different zones (more on that later).\nThere are plenty more ideas over in our easy steps to refreshing your rented flat this weekend.\nIs it just a given that most rented apartments come with awful lighting? Swapping out all those builder-grade light fixtures for some funky shades is quick and easy but still has a big impact.\nIf you don\u2019t have the option to replace the light fixtures, just invest in plenty of floor lamps, string up fairy lights and avoid using those ugly overhead lights.\nA gallery wall is the perfect way to add a ton of interest to a space, especially if you are decorating a living room on a budget.\nThey are our go-to for quickly making a room feel more lived in and hanging a gallery wall yourself is probably much more straightforward than you think \u2013 especially when you use our guide to how to hang a gallery wall.\nThere are plenty ideas over in our inspirational gallery wall ideas, to get you excited about designing your own gallery wall, too.\nTop tip: If you are renting (and want to leave with your deposit), Command Strips are a fail-safe solution for hanging your gallery wall.\nWant an alternative to displaying photos and pictures? Fabric wall hangings and rugs are a quick and cheap way of brightening up your standard-issue blank wall and give a touch of that on-trend boho vibe.\nFind plenty more advice and inspiration in our guide to how to display pictures and photos.\nWhether it\u2019s dirty curtains or depressing aluminium blinds, a lacklustre window treatment is always going to give a space an unpolished feel.\nSwap out your old curtains for fresh ones (these Tibast curtains from Ikea are super cheap) or a simple roller blind.\nIf you can paint, do. It\u2019s one of the easiest and cheapest ways to switch up a space. You don\u2019t just have to stick to one block colour either, add a feature wall with colour blocking or try out an ombre paint effect.\nIf you are renting, pulling up the carpet just isn\u2019t an option, and even if you don\u2019t have a landlord to answer to, it\u2019s still a pretty expensive job. So instead of replacing the carpet, cover it in layers of rugs to add extra colour and patterns.\nFor all you studio apartment dwellers, you may understand the nostalgia that sometimes overcomes you when you remember what it was like to have (more than just four) walls.\nObviously, you don\u2019t want to go dividing up your space with actual solid walls, but you can put up some soft walls (ie, curtains) that can separate your space into zones. The great thing about these temporary walls is you can easily take them down when you want to open up the space again.\nWhen square footage is limited, keeping everything organised is key, hence the need for extra savvy storage. Wall mounted shelves look amazing (as the #shelfie trend proves), they are often inexpensive, plus they will save on precious floor space, too.\nGo for something that's functional and flexible like the String System so you can move the shelves around, add closed storage if you need to and even install a super compact home office by adding a desk.\nTrying to add color to an apartment that is painted in various hues of greige can be tricky, but fear not, you still have options.\nCan\u2019t paint the walls? Use our guide to how to paint furniture and tackle your chairs, headboards, wardrobes and more \u2013 so long as they are yours to paint, anything goes.\nGreenery makes even the smallest of spaces feel fresher and more interesting. And if you don\u2019t have space to spare for house plants on the floor, trying hanging them instead.\nCheck out these house plant display ideas for more inspiration.\nIf your landlord's taste in furniture is...questionable...or you can't afford to replace the tired looking sofa you bought years ago/inherited from a distant aunt, don't write off gorgeous looking furniture just yet.\nIf you're working with a piece from Ikea, Bemz are the brand you've been looking for. Producing stylish looking covers and legs for your sofa, armchair, footstool and much more, it's never been easier to instantly upgrade a space for much less than the cost of buying new.\nFor an even more budget option, pick up new cushions and a couple of throws to revamp your sofa and, in turn, your living space.\nLooking for more decorating inspiration?"
