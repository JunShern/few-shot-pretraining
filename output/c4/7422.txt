    "text": "Rockstar Games has detailed a substantial update for Grand Theft Auto 5's GTA Online which will introduce events and challenges into Freemode, the open world free-for-all that acts as the enormous hub for other multiplayer games.\nAn event can kick off at any time in Freemode and its possible to customise what can and can not happen in your game session. These events and challenges include Penned In \u2013 which tasks players with staying inside a rapidly shrinking dome without being caught outside, and Kill List, which tasks players with entering a specific vehicle and surviving waves of enemies.\nThe update will also bring the Rockstar Editor video creation suite to the PS4 and Xbox One versions of the game, alongside Director Mode. The editor launched alongside the PC version of GTA 5 earlier this year and has proven incredibly popular.\nAlso included are two brand new Adversary Modes: Hunting Pack and Cross The Line. the former makes players \"part of a team tasked to deliver a priority vehicle rigged to explode if it drops below a minimum speed, while your opponents race, ram and batter to take it down.\" (Via Rockstar Newswire) Cross The Line meanwhile is \"where heavily-armed squads face off across a neutral zone \u2013 with the goal of having all team members strategically penetrate their opponents territory to claim victory.\"\nHere's Rockstar's description of all the new Freemode challenges and events.\nPenned In \u2013 A vehicular free-for-all to stay inside an ever-shrinking and always-moving dome. If you're caught outside the dome for more than a few seconds you'll blow up and be eliminated from the competition.\nCriminal Damage \u2013 Rack up the biggest property damage bill you can before time runs out. Equip your biggest weapons and go to town on anything and everything in sight.\nHunt The Beast \u2013 Players team up to track and kill the beast \u2013 a randomly selected player with superior speed and extra health \u2013 before it can collect 10 checkpoints scattered around the world within the time limit. The beast is invisible on the mini-map save for whenever it collects a checkpoint, which will cause it to blip for 10 seconds (and increasing in duration with each checkpoint collected).\nChallenges - Longest jump; longest skydive; longest wheelie; most vehicles stolen; most near misses; lowest parachute deploy; longest bail from vehicle; furthest distance low flying; and more.\nMoving Target - A vehicle is blipped on the map, the first player to deliver it to the marked destination wins.\nKill List - A vehicle is blipped on the map, once the requisite number of players enter they must take out as many waves of enemies as possible.\nKill List Competitive - Same as above, but multiple vehicles are blipped and players compete against each other to rack up the most kills in the given time limit.\nCheckpoints - 120 checkpoints spawn in a quadrant of the map. Players compete to collect the most in the given time limit. This mode comes in two variants: land & sea checkpoints and air checkpoints.\nTime Trial - A persistent blip on the map where players can try to beat the Rockstar par time and world record on a route that changes weekly.\nHold the Wheel - A target vehicle is blipped on the map for 5 minutes. Players compete to be the one in the vehicle when the timer expires.\nHot Property - Players compete to control possession of a blipped briefcase. The longer you have it, the more points you earn.\nDead Drop - A briefcase is blipped for players to collect and deliver to a location. Players compete for the chance to deliver the briefcase.\nKing of the Castle -The first player to a blipped location becomes King, and gain points as long as they remain King. Players compete to kill and become the King.\nA trailer was also released, which you can watch below.\nFifa 16 vs PES 2016 comparison: Which football icon will triumph this year?"
