    "text": "Exceptional applications are welcome even if recruitment is closed for that class.\nPurge is a newly founded guild by a couple individuals with the mindset of serious progression raiding but at the same time, having a community of peers and friends who support each other and flourish.\nWe are looking to push for the top and be very competitive with other guilds. Possibilities are endless and we are looking for those that are looking to prove they have what it takes to be the best at what they love doing and playing.\nPeople who join with inferior gear will be geared up through alt / secondary runs. We are frequently making raids to gear up people who lack ILVL 350-355 which is needed for progression raids.\nWe are soon making a secondary raid team which will progress on their own time.\nIf you troll, expect to be trolled.\nIn guildchat we have an english only policy.\nYour raid team is a TEAM, play like one & act like one.\nConstructive criticism is fine, but baseless criticism is unwanted.\nWe have no tolerance for drama. Especially during raid times. If you have a problem with another guild member - do it in whispers.\nSigning on for raids is done using the blizzard calender system.\nSigning as ACCEPTED means you will come to the raid. If you are not coming or situation change, change your status accordingly.\nRaid invites are prioritised between having the right roll and showing up on time. We always select what we deem are the best players available.\nWhile we are clearing trash and gathering our raid group - talking on TS is encouraged and even appreciated. However, while we are in the process of killing bosses, only one player (the raid leader) will talk and make calls relating to the encounter. Others are discouraged to talk as that may distrupt the communication and confusing our raid group. Should the unfortunate event happen and we wipe, we will discuss how we can improve as a team. Making criticism so that it is recieved properly is very important when looking for mistakes that happens doing a wipe. For that reason I will demonstrate the difference between negative and constructive criticism.\nAs an example: Tank - VampAtDawn dies on Deep Breath doing Valiona and Theralion encounter.\nGood criticism: VampAtDawn, when Valiona is flying towards the end of the stairs - be sure to check out where she is position so you can dodge Deep Breath.\nBad criticism: VampAtDawn, you failed hard vs. this boss. Step it up.\nWhile our trial process does not last a set amount of time, typical trials last two weeks. Trials tend to be on the longer side for healers, tanks, and during farm content. During your trial you will be expected to ask questions and take responsibility for your own performance. If we feel you have a lot of potential but need to work on a few things, we may choose to extend your trial.\nWe use a loot council system, which is typical of progression raiding guilds and which has worked well for us. While we tend gear our tanks before anyone else for obvious reasons, we normally assign loot based on what seems sensible to us (for example, during Baleroc progression, DPS would be geared up first).\nThe loot council system is ideally speaking prioritising those who will recieve the biggest upgrade and those we need to gear the most. That being said - things like accountabillity (is he/she a reliable raider?), performance (does he perform well?), and attendency (is he attending all the raids?) will also be taken into account.\nAll BoE and shards will be allocated to the guild bank for enchants and gearing up recruits / alts.\nDo you have a casual/friends/family rank?\nNot currently, no. You are welcome to join with any alts you have, but as this is a raiding guild we try to make sure that the people who join can actually raid with us.\nThe guild is led by a group of players with typically very high attendance. People in a leadership position are selected based on merits such as a good attitude towards wow, steady performance raidwise and most importantly; being motivational towards fellow guild members."
