    "text": "GMAT scores are used as a common benchmark to compare candidates for admission to MBA and specialised Masters programmes.\nEach of the above scores will be accompanied by a percentile rank, which highlights the proportion of test takers who scored lower than you did. The higher your percentile rank, the better you did. For example, if you received a percentile rank of 70, this means you scored higher than 70% of test takers worldwide. This number tells schools exactly where you fell with respect to all the other GMAT candidates.\nAnalytical Writing Assessment essays are graded separately by both a human and a computer. Grades are assigned holistically on a 0-6 scale, taking into account all aspects of the essay\u2019s content, writing style, and grammar. If the two grades for an essay agree, that score will be assigned. If they do not agree, then a third scorer (human) will re-grade the essay.\nIf you cancel your scores: You can cancel your score right after you take the exam at the test center (for free), or within 72 hours of taking the exam ($25 fee). No canceled scores will be sent to selected schools. Only you will know if you cancel your scores.\nDetailed instructions and rules for about this are available on page 13 of the GMAT Handbook .\nHow long is my score valid for?\nGMAT scores are valid for 5 years. This means that every time you take the GMAT, your record will show that score for the next 5 years. Many people take the GMAT more than once, so do not be afraid to re-sit the test to try and improve your score, but be aware that if you keep re-taking the test, business schools will see all of your scores from the last 5 years. We recommend that you prepare thoroughly and then take the test once or twice, rather than keep taking the test to try and score higher.\nWhat's the average GMAT score?\nThe average score among all GMAT test-takers worldwide is approximately 561. However, the average GMAT scores of students at the top business schools\u2014 such as Wharton, Columbia, Kellogg, INSEAD, LBS and IMD are much higher than this.\nWhat you consider a good score will depend on your own expectations and target schools. Top business schools consider a score of at least 600 competitive, but in reality, most successful applicants score higher than this. Information on average GMAT scores at different schools is readily available, and many schools\u2019 websites list their average GMAT score. Research the programmes on your list and find out what their average scores are so you know what you're aiming for."
