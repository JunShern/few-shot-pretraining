    "text": "Luis Suarez is set to make his return after suspension against Manchester United in the Capital One Cup next Wednesday. At the fourth FWA Live sponsored by Barclays in Liverpool the panel - Michael Owen (former Liverpool, Real Madrid, Newcastle United, Manchester United, Stoke City and England striker, now a BT Sport pundit), Alan Stubbs (Everton\u2019s Under-21 coach), Andy Dunn (FWA chairman), Chris Bascombe (Daily Telegraph), Paul Joyce (Daily Express) and Jonathan Northcroft (Sunday Times) spoke about the Uruguay striker and much more. FWA executive secretary Paul McCarthy was the MC.\nMO: I watched a lot of Liverpool in pre-season and they looked good, very efficient, Lucas was sat in front of the back-four, they looked solid with so much interchange in forward positions. Daniel Sturridge is scoring goals and while we don\u2019t want to get too carried away, I said in the BT Sport predictions Liverpool would finish fourth and got a lot of stick. I stand by that, I like what I\u2019m seeing and I think they\u2019ll have a good season.\nCB: The Champions League is so huge these days, it\u2019s a monster and there\u2019s almost an open-top bus tour for finishing fourth. But Liverpool are still far away from winning the title. Rather than measure Liverpool by position I\u2019d do it by points. If they get 70 this season they\u2019ll have done well and it may be enough to finish fourth.\nAD: The advantage Liverpool have is they face only 30-odd more games that really matter in the Barclays Premier League. With no Europe that\u2019s all they need to concentrate on and with Suarez to come back there is no reason why they can\u2019t aim higher than fourth.\nPJ: Inevitably when the January window comes round there will be some interest [in Suarez]. He\u2019ll give his all when he comes back, but I can see this situation playing up again. It\u2019ll be interesting to see whether his contract is renegotiated.\nPM: It was renegotiated last summer, should it be renegotiated again?\nAS: We had Liverpool\u2019s most charismatic player [Steven Gerrard] saying how important Suarez is to the team for them to achieve something. That says it all.\nJN: Fans are caught in two minds over Suarez. They are tired of the sagas he\u2019s put them through, but on the pitch he has never been anything other than a brilliant 100 per cent player. If he performs as he did before people will forgive him. The great thing for Liverpool is that Suarez is coming back into a winning team, not as a saviour. He\u2019ll have to fight for a place, maybe even playing wide to fit more into the team pattern. Perhaps unexpectedly Liverpool are in a much stronger position than you would have thought throughout the summer.\nAD: The reception Suarez and Wayne Rooney have been getting is amazing. Here we have two players at two clubs...institutions...and both Suarez and Rooney said they didn\u2019t want to be there. Rooney\u2019s said it twice over the past two years. Fans have changed. I can remember the times when they would have been run out of town. The players should be grateful because they have been given a lot of indulgences by the fans.\nPM: Would you bring him back against Manchester United in the Capital One Cup?\nJN: Yes. He\u2019ll be motivated by playing for a winning team. He\u2019s a natural competitor. I interviewed him last season [the interview was published on the day of the Ivanovic biting incident] and asked him what his favourite part was. He said the start because he was playing two games a week. It gave an insight into his mentality.\nThe panel moved on to Suarez\u2019s summer transfer to Arsenal that fell through.\nMO: I think Arsenal are lacking everywhere. Defensively they have a good record, but they don\u2019t convince. If they get to the latter stages of the Champions League I wouldn\u2019t be too sure about their defence. Midfield looks OK, not the strikers...over the years they\u2019ve had Ian Wright, Thierry Henry, Dennis Bergkamp and Robin van Persie, some of the best in the world. Giroud is scoring a few goals, but it was significant they tried to buy Suarez. They\u2019re off it, for me, by a good few players.\nPJ: In the corporate world, if you are given a budget and a target to achieve by the end of your financial year and you don\u2019t achieve it because you decided not to spend that budget then you have failed. Wenger is not the finance director, he\u2019s the football manager and why he tries to protect their finances I don\u2019t understand. If your objective has been to make the top four every year while repaying for the stadium then he\u2019s achieved it.\nPM: ...Chelsea under Jose Mourinho?\nCB: They played a very effective kind of counter-attacking football. Wenger completely changed so much in our game and everyone tried to follow. We\u2019ll look back at Wenger and think he was a visionary, but at the moment he is struggling with the modern dynamics of the game.\nAD: The Suarez bid was so out of character. Someone had obviously told him if you bid \u00a340 million and one pound then you can have him...you\u2019ll get him. It\u2019s unusual that he would just take someone\u2019s word for it and it struck me he took his eye off the ball. If the agent tells you you can have him for that amount you\u2019d want to double-check. You\u2019d want to see the actual clause for starters. It wasn\u2019t a Wenger-type thing to do given all the preparation that goes into his bids. It made me wonder if he was thinking it is his last season. He\u2019s made a bid here on the strength of someone having a word in his shell-like.\nAS: My understanding was he [Fellani] took a cut on some of his wages he was due from Manchester United to make sure the deal went through. So putting a transfer request in saved them a little bit of money. The way the transfer deadline goes...everyone looks at it...it got to a stage where we knew the Bale thing was going to happen...that was the big one...underlying from that there wasn\u2019t really an awful lot going on...probably come seven o\u2019clock in the night at Everton the word from the training ground was that no one was going to go...Fellaini was staying ...Bainesey was never really an option...the club had dug its heels in ...Bainesey had obviously said he\u2019d like to go...and then come nine o\u2019clock suddenly we started to get linked with Lukaku and then the Fellaini thing was starting with negotiations with United...by the time it [the transfer window] had finished we\u2019d bought three in [Gareth Barry, Romelu Lukaku and James McCarthy] and they are great additions to the squad.\nAD: With Wayne Rooney, even if he had put a transfer request in United would just turn round and say: \u201cno.\u201d If Rooney had put in a transfer request and United had said no, he would have looked even worse. You can write a transfer request in blood, but you still don\u2019t have to leave. He had a decision to make: if he does put a request in and it is then refused, it would be the end with the fans. The fans then know...if they hadn\u2019t heard from Rooney they can think maybe he doesn\u2019t want to go. We all knew he wanted to go.\nPJ: He had a similar situation when United said \u201coh, you\u2019re a star...here\u2019s X-amount more\u201d and he got himself a new contract. Was there an element of that again?\nAD: I don\u2019t think that was the case this time.\nJN: Two years ago he did get a new deal out of it. What\u2019s different this time is that he was told right from the start the club didn\u2019t even want to negotiate a new contract. The message was for him to get his head down and prove himself again. It put him in a strange position \u2013 he did want to leave, but two things changed the way he felt. He was worried what Ferguson said would turn the fans against him, but it\u2019s obvious they still support him. He also worried whether Ferguson still being there...would he still be interfering? When Mourinho came said \u201cput a transfer request in\u201d that was just Mourinho being naughty.\nPM: Do we admire the stance of Manchester United and Liverpool because in the past the trend was, generally, players got the moves they wanted. Big clubs now are taking a stance against big players.\nMO: The first time he [Rooney] wanted to go he won the battle, basically, and got an extra zero [on his contract]. This time it\u2019s been different. He wants to play all the time, Robin van Persie came in and stole his thunder...he\u2019s not the first name on the team-sheet and more...Ferguson left him out of the Real Madrid game...a new manager came in and made noises that van Persie was his number one. All of a sudden he\u2019s thinking \u201cI don\u2019t want to be second fiddle. I need to be playing.\u201d He wants to be loved and play all the time. The Suarez situation was a better example of of a club saying \u201cno, you are not going anywhere.\u201d You have to bear in mind their backgrounds, who they are and where they are from. Liverpool fans love Suarez and yes, he\u2019ll appreciate the affection, but he doesn\u2019t have the sort of bond with them like a Steven Gerrard or a Jamie Carragher. Suarez is from South America, he\u2019s played in Holland and whoever had paid the fee to Ajax he\u2019d have gone. He didn\u2019t come to Liverpool because he adored the club. When people say they showed him loyalty so just show it back...bear in mind he wanted to reach the top of his career. I understand where he\u2019s coming from.\nMO: Players always get the raw end of the deal. Fans support [their club] through thick and thin...if I wasn\u2019t a footballer I\u2019d have been supporting Everton...if anyone did anything to harm my club and wanted to leave I\u2019d say \u201cno way.\u201d If you work for a company and a rival offers you more money, to have better career prospects, no one would bat an eyelid if you moved. Most people have done this. Why is it wrong for a footballer? Because football fans expect everyone else to feel the same way [about their club]. Most footballers just want to reach the top of their profession like anyone else. Fans can\u2019t understand that because they are so indebted to the badge on the shirt. This is unfair in many ways."
