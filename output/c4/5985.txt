I was in your shoes once before. Not only did I break the cycle for myself, I broke the cycle for my children. Our thoughts create our habits; our behavioral patterns, which ultimately are inherited by our children. Breaking the cycle for our future is my mission. But it starts with YOU. Our thoughts and actions create a ripple effect that reaches far beyond yourself.\nYou hold the power inside to create the life full of the beauty and wonder you saw as a child. It\u2019s all right here for you to discover. 24-weeks will come and go no matter what\u2026 but what you choose today will determine what you will see at the end of those 24 weeks.\nOne day at a time, one thought at a time."
