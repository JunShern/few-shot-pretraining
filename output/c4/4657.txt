No, she knew what she was doing, because Harvard Business School trained her to do a certain job. Education had/has nothing to do with Facebook\u2019s corruption. The functionaries who run that place are trained to know how to fulfill their satrap role. Being well read and knowledgeable of a large inventory of ideas isn\u2019t required in a corporate boardroom. This here blog proves that.."
