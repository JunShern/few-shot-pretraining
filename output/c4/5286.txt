    "text": "Note: It's a good idea to go into this mission (as all missions) with some decent firepower... and Body Armor if you can get some.\nWhen you meet Wu Zi's bodyguard he will tell you about a curse--apparently the boss is blind, but blessed with good fortune. Wu Zi (Woozie) tells you that he is the leader of the Mountain Cloud Boys, and wants you to take him to a nearby meeting of Triads, where is about to mediate a dispute. Get in a car and drive him to the marker around the block.\nWu Zi senses that something isn't right upon arriving. Follow him into the alley as he explores. When you get to a gate, he tells you it's usually locked. When you step through, you'll come into an alley full of pain. The Vietnamese gang wiped everyone out, and bodies and wrecked cars are strewn everywhere.\nAs you are about to leave, you'll find yourself sealed in by the rival gang. Crouch and take them out one by one, and move forward. Drop the guys crouched behind the car blocking the alley and keep Woozie safe. If his meter drops to zero, the mission will fail. As you move past the car, some bikes will pull up and drop some thugs off. They immediately start spraying, so crouch and return fire. Move to the corner and waste the guys in the next alley.\nMove fully around the corner and take down a new throng, including the guy perched on the rooftop ahead. Use the dumpster on the right side of the alley as cover. When they all die, get in the car. You drive and Woozie will shoot. Maneuever so he can get some nice shots off, moving parallel to their vehicles. When they all die, a yellow blip will appear on the radar. Drive over to it. You'll earn $5000 and some respect for finishing the mission.\nWoozie's second mission involves a man named Ran Fa Li--he needs a package picked up at the airport. Sounds like a job for you! Oh, and they also mention something about a new gang moving in... the Da Nang boys.\nGet in a car and follow the blip out to the airport. When you get there, drive into the parking garage and get in the car that's waiting for you. The Da Nang boys have blocked all the exits... so go away from them. Instead of driving in the direction of the exit arrows, go to the central row and go the other way. Follow them back to the actual ramp entrance. Along the way, your path will be blocked by armed men. Drive over them and out of the airport.\nAs you get outside, look at the mini-map. Now your goal is to get to the yellow marker on the mini-map. Of course, you'll need to do this with a minimum of damage. Watch the Damage meter on the right side of the screen. If it drops to zero, the mission will end. As you move out of the airport, motorcycles will begin to dog you. At the point where they join up, turn right and head to the freeway. As the pursuers pull up next to you, look toward them and gun them off their bikes, and continue on your merry way. Once you eliminate them, cruise the outer edge of the city, heading to the Esplanade. Once there, park in the red to reap the reward-- $6000 and some respect.\nThis mission puts you back on the country trail. The idea is to lure the Da Nang boys out to the wilds, with the idea that they're on the trail of Ran Fa Li. Get in the truck and drive carefully (leaving your vehicle will end the mission) out to the country, sticking to the highways as you make your way to the yellow marker.\nWhen you get to Angel Pine, drive into the red marker. At this point, it turns into a checkpoint race with two motorcycles chasing you. The main objective here is to keep the back of your truck intact. Yeah, that's right. If they blow it off, they will find out for sure that Ran Fa Li isn't there. It's possible to make the bikers wipe out right off the bat by knocking some trees over in their path, or by shooting them yourself. With no threat to worry about, it's simply a matter of driving through the checkpoints at your own leisure.\nYou'll have a lot of warning before each checkpoint, and there is quite a bit of distance between each marker, so concentrate on keeping things steady, trying to knock out the bikers who dog you... and keeping Damage to a minimum. As always, if that meter is emptied, you will fail the mission. The last checkpoint is at a rest stop off the freeway. Once you park in the marker, you'll get a cell call and pass the mission, with a hefty $8000 bonus. It's a long haul back to Woozie's, so you better get going.\nThis mission is only available in the nighttime hours of 20:00-6:00. You'll also need to have the proper lung capacity for this challenge, so spend some time getting that stat right if you haven't already. When you have the appropriate amount of breath needed, grab a car and head to the docks (marked by a yellow blip). Step on the red dot once you get there.\nThe tanker you need to get to is out in the bay, and you'll need to swim out to it. Problem is, it's being patrolled by the Da Nang boys. The idea here is to swim through the markers to reach the tanker without being seen. Swim through the surface markers and submerge to go through those under the water. Swim forward and you'll be told to dive and get a Knife. Go down and grab it, resurface and head forward to the next marker.\nSwim through the remaing checkpoints until you emerge in the bay. Here, several boats will be patrolling, and the tanker is marked by a yellow blip. The patrol boats will see you if you swim along the surface, so if you get spotted, submerge and swim forward until they no longer suspect anything. When they stop looking, resurface to grab some breath. As long as you remain motionless,. you can fill up your air gauge without being seen.\nAs you near the tanker, avoid the searchlights. If you get caught in one, guards will shoot at you. Avoid them and swim underwater to get to the platform on the far side of the ship. Climb out of the water and walk up the steps to the deck of the tanker. Crouch and sneak up the stairs and come in stealthily behind the first guard. Use the knife to stealth kill him.\nContinue down the central corridor, waiting for the guards to turn and stealth killing them as you do. It's not necessary to stealth kill everyone... you can just slice them up with the knife, but stealth killing will ensure that you will keep all of your own health. Make your way up one of the stairways and continue the killing spree. Move into the doorway at the front of the boat, sneak down the stairs and kill the guard. Continue down stairways until you reach the red marker. Make sure there are no guards around and plant the bug. Return to the deck and plop in the water. It's the same story on the way back. Dive to avoid being seen by the thugs, resurface to breathe. Make your way to the docks and step on the red marker to end the mission. You will earn a whopping $11,000 for your efforts.\nIt's time to deal with the Da Nang Gang once and for all. Wu Zi sends Little Lion to do some flybys of a heroin ship that's docking in the bay. Although he says he doesn't need your help, you head to the copter anyway to accompany LL.\nOnce you get into the chopper, a gun sight will immediately appear. You've got a mounted minigun aboard, and the idea is to take down the Da Nang boys that are scattered around the deck of the ship. Midway through the mission, you'll take rocket fire and the chopper will go into the drink. Swim over to the ship, and into the red marker.\nAfter you board the vessel, sneak up behind the nearby guard and stealth slice him and pick up his weapon. Climb the nearby crates and try to stealth kill the guard up here. Either that, or just blow him away with your acquired shotgun. Climb up one more level of crates and waste whoever's around, then move to the opposite edge and smoke the fools on the stack ahead.\nMove through the snaking corridor between the crates, using the small boxes as cover as you pick off the enemy. Remember, there are guys at different levels here, so watch out for death from above. Be sure to grab the Heart in the nook pictured below.\nContinue around, taking out a trio of guards in the next section. Around the ensuing corner, you'll see a hole in the floor. Walk around to the far side and drop in to the orange crate below. You will see a short cutscene with the Da Nang boys piling into the area. From your position, crouch and fire as they appear.\nWhen the first wave goes down, hop to the ground and proceed right, over the crates there. In this area, you'll find a Body Armor and SMG. Grab them and head toward where the guards appeared. Weave through the stacks, whacking the fools who appear. Watch out for surprise attacks from behind! As you reach a long corridor, watch out for the grenade toss from the thug at the other end. One direct hit will chew through kevlar and take a full bar of health down.\nThere are refugees stuck inside a padlocked crate. Shoot the lock off and you'll be told that Snakehead imprisoned them there. Your new mission is to kill everyone on the bridge. Backtrack to the hole in the ceiling on the right side of the first area and climb out, heading for the red blip on the map. Climb over the crates and make your way to the open door, killing the guard in front of it. Move up the stairway to meet Snakehead. He'll toss you a sword. Target him and start swinging! One good stroke should finish him. When he goes down,. go back to the blue marker on the map. Meet up with them and you'll end the mission and get $15,000. This is the last of Woozie's missions, but you must complete it before finishing the Syndicate jobs."
