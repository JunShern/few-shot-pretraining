We also had the pleasure of working with Kristie Chua, who has moved onto other endeavors.\nPosted on 10/13/2016 by kristiechua\tin Live Review and tagged Beach Slang, Bleached, James Alex, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, punk rock.\nBeach Slang and Bleached announced a shared tour earlier this year and launched it at the Black Cat on Tuesday.\nTo the surprise of many, however, Bleach Slang band leader James Alex revealed only hours prior to the show that he would undertake the tour alone and without his three bandmates.\nPosted on 10/04/2016 by Mickey McCarter\tin Live Review and tagged Beach Slang, Black Cat, Bleached, Hunny, Philadelphia, punk rock.\nPhiladelphia punk trio Beach Slang make impressively dynamic punk, at turns explosive or reflective.\nJames Alex (vocals, guitar), Ed McNulty (bass), and Ruben Gallego (guitar) play songs about finding your place or making your way forward on their second full-length album, A Loud Bash of Teenage Feelings, released Sept. 23 via Polyvinyl Records. Beach Slang are touring to promote the record, and they stop at the Black Cat on Tuesday, Oct. 11.\nBy Beach Slang\u2019s account, \u201cteenage feelings\u201d consist a lot of looking out for yourself but they also involve a heck of a lot of energy. The new song \u201cAtom Bomb\u201d for example is a wonderful two-minute rock-n-roll celebration of feeling larger than life.\n\u201cWe need endorphin-heavy, heart-on-sleeve, major-chord, grin-inducing punk rock right now. I mean we need it. There\u2019s a goddamn duty of care: punk has to hold people to account and spit against authority, but sometimes you need to smile like an idiot and let go,\u201d Noisey said of Beach Slang.\nThe punk gents of Beach Slang are touring with the punk ladies of Bleached on a double bill at the Black Cat. (Revisit our review of Bleached from their show at DC9 in April.) California rockers Hunny open the show.\nPosted on 04/18/2016 by Mickey McCarter\tin Live Review and tagged Bleached, DC9, Los Angeles, No Parents, punk rock.\nThe ladies of Bleached brought some resplendent guitars and a devil-may-care attitude to DC9 last Wednesday in support of a punchy sophomore album, Welcome the Worms.\nJennifer Clavin sings and plays guitar with a bright vitality that often covers up a subversive lyrical streak. Early in the band\u2019s set, Jennifer sings \u201cKeep On Keepin\u2019 On,\u201d ostensibly a new song about powering through a challenge, but the narrator\u2019s challenge is forgetting the past and the mistakes she\u2019s made so that she can hook up with the guy she desires.\nLost love is a recurring theme in the songs of Bleached, and although it comes up quite a bit on the new album, the band also sang a lot of broken hearts and missing partners on its debut album, Ride Your Heart, from 2013. Songs like \u201cSearching Through the Past\u201d and \u201cWaiting by the Telephone\u201d from the debut album concern themselves with that absent mate but also offer up rollickin\u2019 guitars in a sunny, punky stampede of strings.\nPosted on 04/15/2016 by Mickey McCarter\tin Live Review and tagged Bleached, DC9, Los Angeles, No Parents, punk rock, skate punk.\nReaders of L.A. Weekly voted No Parents as \u201cBest Band\u201d of 2015! And the goofy skate punks, who opened for Bleached at DC9 on Wednesday night, sure have a way with words.\n\u201cNo Parents are like a John Hughes movie starring the Menendez brothers: a cute comedy loaded with violence and splattered adults. For the layman who reads about punk rock in fashion mags, they\u2019re the next FIDLAR \u2014 the new torchbearers of skate-punk,\u201d said L.A. Weekly.\nNo Parents are four men strong, although there were five of them at DC9. An additional touring guitarist perhaps?\nPosted on 04/05/2016 by Mickey McCarter\tin Live Review and tagged Bleached, DC9, garage, Los Angeles, No Parents, punk rock.\nThe talented Clavin sisters, Jen and Jessie, once fronted a garage band called Mika Miko in Los Angeles. Despite the band\u2019s popularity, they left it to join bassist Micayla Grace in a new garage project, Bleached.\nThe resulting punk band borrowed a sneer from Joan Jett and girl band pop vocals from the likes of The Shangri-La\u2019s. Thematically, they deal with bad romance and bad habits. Bleached released a debut album, Ride Your Heart, in 2013, and they now have returned for their sophomore effort, Welcome the Worms, released April 1! The ladies have hit the road on a tour in support of the album, and they stop at DC9 on Wednesday, April 13.\nL.A. punk quartet No Parents open for Bleached. Tickets are available online!"
