Basically, you get to decide how much you want to pay for a bunch of awesome patterns while supporting independent designers AND contributing to some wonderful charities all at the same time. Selfish sewing just got a whole new meaning.\nIndependent designers create patterns that are innovative, imaginative and in line with current style trends. Their patterns encompass a broad range of sizes and fabulous \u201cout of the envelope\u201d fit because they're thoroughly tested by real people. Indie designers are approachable, providing support, suggestions, publishing additions to your favourite designs, and hosting interactive sewing events. When we are patrons of indie designers, we are supporting small businesses. We are developing the community around us. We are helping make dreams come true.\nWe ask you to dedicate part of your purchase to support the mission of Perfect Pattern Parcel. Our mission is to support indie designers, give to charity, and expand awareness to further those two primary goals. PPP funds cover the cost of all hosting and payment processing fees so the designers and charities don't have to. With any dollar we spend as a PPP expense, our goal is to earn that dollar back and then some. Every dollar that isn't used to cover expenses is reallocated to charity.\nDonors Choose is an organisation that matches up the needs of teachers and their students for specific projects with willing donors. The funds raised from each Pattern Parcel sale will go to help K-12 students in minimising educational inequality and encourage a community where children have the tools and experiences necessary for an excellent education. From pencils for poetry to microscopes for mitochondria, your support will help address educational inequality and grow generations to come. To date, you've helped us raise over $13,000!\nAs of posting this there are currently just over 4 days left to purchase your very own Pattern Parcel #6 before it's gone forever. If you're still sitting on the fence, then let me tell you, the amazing-ness of the patterns contained within has meant that this parcel has been the biggest one yet! So, what are you waiting for?\nIn other news, did you see the new Sewing Pattern Directory is now live? Jane has done such an amazing job. And, oh, there's a wee interview from yours truly featured on the front page, you know, just in case you're interested. The Sewing Pattern Directory is pretty much where it's at if you like using patterns produced by independent designers. They feature the ones you already know and you'll be able to discover new ones.\n4 comments on \"Pattern Parcel #6 and some House Keeping...\"\nThanks for the heads up on the sewing pattern directory, what a great concept!
