But have you ever thought, with the level of rising pollution, the water we get is something that we can consume directly? Just for the record, over five years to 2017, water-borne diseases, such as cholera, diarrhoea, typhoid and viral hepatitis caused 10,738 deaths, revealed a latest government data.\nThe Raskob grant helped RO Water Treatment Machine for the World reach four more rural communities in Honduras where, in addition to clean water, nearly 150 families got pit latrines.\nIt\u2019s all part of the nonprofit agency\u2019s water, sanitation and hygiene program to promote health and better lives for people in some of the poorest communities in Honduras and Haiti.\nIn addition, these facilities are important to the work of the Catholic Church. She referred to a seminarian in Trojes who said lack of basic services like clean water and sanitation affects church outreach. If priests, seminarians and catechists get sick, \u201cthis causes delays in preaching the word of God to families,\u201d he told her.\nPure water equipment with RO system for the World teaches people in the areas they serve to be \u201ccommunity agents\u201d and educate their neighbors about the water filters and latrines. This fosters community development, and \u201cit is important to have reliable resources to build up their reliance on each other and strengthen their community,\u201d said Brother Richard Iaquinto, Weston\u2019s prior."
