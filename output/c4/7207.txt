    "text": "From the leanest of the Fwonk elite, we present to you Derams of Lithotripsy \u2013 an LP epic with all the trimmings. Fat, bone, and gristle washed down with a few delectable shots of thick, warm blood. Recorded over a single week when our Lord and Master left our virtual residence for sunnier climes, this 18 track ode to a lost Chieftain removes the need for polish, replacing it with raw dynamism and reflexive potentiality.\nCurated and organised by Katarrhaktes, this also features the work of Limb-Bow, Czechchap, Vasko The Pig, Bachelor Machines, Valinsjev, Cupid Stunt, Puppet Show, Echosonic, Lisa Librarian, Imploded View, Quiggers, Fudgedubnofunk and Iain M Spillane.\nBalls to \u2018seizing the day\u2019. That\u2019s for relentless over-achievers to do. Let\u2019s imagine the day, lie supine in wistful thought, declare \u201cthe muse has alighted \u2018pon my soul\u201d and give in to the wondrous capacity for creative thought. These ten personally selected tracks capture some of the amazing brain-splat that Fwonk* artists can achieve. Enjoy these tunes, follow the links and grab some more brain food!\nWhile the cat\u2019s away the mice will play. And record. And submit. One terrifying week in July, the Spirit of Fwonk himself disappeared into the aether, leaving the rabble to fend for themselves. This is what we created whilst he was gone; a selection of tracks that are reactive rather than contemplative, instinctive knee-jerks rather than fully realised ideas. Fwonk without the frills or the varnish. The cheap, dirty underbelly of Fwonk."
