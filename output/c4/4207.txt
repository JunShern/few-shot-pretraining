    "text": "The Cats have wrapped up on the field for the day--and a sweltering one it was----and here are a couple of observations that my pal Drew probably would have had out there a lot earlier, but he's enjoying a well-deserved day off.\n* The Cats are fast. Flat out, no modifiers.\n*The defence is so far ahead of last year at this point that it's useless to even try to compare. Huge defensive plays made several times by both Rico Murray and Pawel Kruba at linebacker. Some guys who made starts last year will not make this team, is our guess.\n*The Canadian depth of this team is ridiculously good, and we'll address that a bit in the main column today (which is about Ted Laurent).\n* Obviously, as the top of the five-man quarterback pyramid, Zach Collaros got the A reps in team and \"skelly\" sessions in Monday's second day of Tiger-Cat training camp. The bulk of the rest of the reps went to Jeremiah Masoli, No. 3 on the depth chart last year.\n\"The quarterbacks understand that there isn't enough time to get reps for them each day,\" explained head coach Ken Austin of the way pivot assignments will be handled in training camp. \"We don't have enough reps to distribute five deep, or even four deep.\n\"Sometimes there is a modification, though, because we do things by concept. So if a quarterback is short of reps on a certain concept, then we have to rotate it differently to make sure that he comes up to curve in some learning, where he didn't have enough reps.\n\"There is a lot that goes into it each night as we plan reps.\"\nHere's part of the plan, we'll guess: Collaros gets every rep he needs, especially with the prospect of a strike/lockout which could cost precious development time for a guy trying to go from a seven-game No. 2, to an 18-game No. 1.\n*Andy Fantuz has never held for a left-footed kicker. Justin Medlock returns to the team after a two-year NFL absence and, apparently, is still kicking with his left foot.\nFantuz said it's an adjustment because Medlock is not only left-footed, he does not use a kicking tee---Medlock says that's actually easier for a holder once he gets used to it---and because unlike other kickers Medlock does not like the ball held down from the top with one or two fingers or the whole hand, but likes the tip of the ball pinched between forefinger and thumb to make it easier to rotate, if necessary.\nMedlock says it'll take 200 practice snaps to get it right but will he have that with Fantuz, who's a first-stringer on offence?\nNo, it says here. That's one reason why Jason Boltus, third-string quarterback, was his holder here before. Receivers Luke Tasker and Corey Koch both with reliable, and big, hands like Fantuz are also asking for practice time as holder.\n*Austin was asked whether he'd like to carry five quarterbacks as he did last year.\n\"We're trying to push to about eight or nine,\" he quipped before adding. \"I don't know. if there's a ned to do that we will.\"\n* And how is Collaros making out in his adaptation to the Austin Way, which requires an awful lot of conceptual knowledge and reaction to what's playing out in front of him?\n\"He's improving a lot,\" Austin said. \" It doesn't matter what new system you go into, there's new terminology. It's like Greek af first. First you have to get comfortable with the terminology then you have to understand WHY we're doing what we're doing, and not just what. You can't have a robotic memory, coming out on this football field, you have to learn conceptually because of our adjustments. That takes time to sink in, but Zach's doing agreat job right now in his understanding and progression of learning.\"\nTed doesn't only look big he plays big.\nMasoli (well, Austin's brilliance) got us home field advantage last year.\nWhat a difference a gm makes. Old picked up other teams castoffs. Even Glenn was cut even before training camp in Peg. Before comming here as saviour. New: even last years starters might not make team ?! Wow. From replacing garbage with garbage to replacing starters with stars!!\nAnd fast! I was wondering how our new QB was doing myself, even after only 2 days so thanks for addressing it, Mr Steve!\n2014: the Year of the Cats!\nIt is truly great to hear (but I'm not really surprised) that the Ticats are way ahead of where they were last season. Continuity of coaching staff and keeping the core of players together will do that. With a new QB, offense could take a bit longer to come together but then that was true last year when EVERYONE was learning a new system. Great to hear too that there is lots of speed, some of which was evident at times last season.\nAs for Medlock's holder - I would think that they might try out someone who is NOT a first string player. Last year when Fantuz was injured Congi had to adjust to a different holder (Bartel). Of course any player could be injured during the season, but using a backup (like they did with Boltus - maybe Lauther would work?) might avoid the possibility of having to substitute someone less familiar (or completely unfamiliar) with Medlock's style in case of injury.\nThe man just known as Ted.\n@Ryan y - How well he's coming along? It's Day 2 of camp... isn't it a little early to be asking that? We heard a bit of feedback after the OTA, but still, what else is a coach supposed to say at this point? And what are reporters supposed to be noticing when the drills have just been getting under way?\nRe: holders for placekicking, I'm curious about the thinking behind continuing to use a receiver to do the job, versus one of the backup QBs - they can certainly run the ball if the snap is botched, but you'd think having someone like Masoli or LeFevour doing it would open up more options on a broken placekick.\nIs it just me or are the ticats and reporters Being VERY careful about raising the fans expectations about how well Collaros is coming along? There have no articles about how great he is doing and Kent Austin gives the same cookie cutter responses whenever a reporter asks. I don't know maybe I've gotten used to the nfls reporters and their hyperbole over the off season but it scares me. This guy played one very bad preseason game last year I remember thinking wow he's terrible and lost the backup job to the argos Harris. I'm not sure how he ended up being second string again when Ricky went down but this kid is a HUGE gamble. And I think people should start to gear back the expectations a bit about a return to and winning the grey cup this year I think this kid might need a year or two to learn the game and become what all his potential says he could be.\nCould have used Laurent last year! Should have used the Gaydosh pick to get him! Oh well, better late than never.\nAlso agree that speed is good... Just look at how dangerous our STs were when Thigpen or Williams were returning the kicks for TDs.\nI haven't had a chance to get to camp yet... So will rely on others... How does Plesius look at MLB?\nGlad to hear team is fast; as many coaches have said \"you can't coach/teach speed\".\nNot surprised Masoli is 2nd QB (so far). I think he adds a quite different dimension to Ticat offence, whereas Lefevour is very similar in skills to Collaros.\nSigning of Laurent is huge, Ticats will have so many ratio options this year."
