    "text": "HELICOPTER PARENTS\u2026.PART 2\u2026.In response to my post this morning about the Wall Street Journal\u2019s discovery of \u201chelicopter parents,\u201d I got an email that I thought was good enough to post in its entirety. I can\u2019t personally vouch for or against anything my untenured and therefore anonymous correspondent says, but it\u2019s certainly entertaining. Enjoy.\nThe WSJ is not \u201con\u201d to something. It\u2019s late to the damn party. For a few years now I\u2019ve been teaching freshman comp and assorted other undergraduate English courses to students at [an expensive private university in the heartland] which basically means the students all started studying for college entrance exams in kindergarten, they\u2019re all pre-law or pre-med in their freshman year, and they come from fantastically affluent families (or else families that have decided Little Ian and Laura are worth bankrupting the family for a lifetime) who believe that their $45,000 a year entitles them and their students to set the pedagogical agenda.\nWe will ignore, for the moment, the myriad ways this tendency is reinforced by the deans offices (increasingly run by platoons of \u201cstudent affairs\u201d staff whose expertise seems to have derived from a mishmash of self-actualizing pop-psych, teen-marketing ala \u201cMs Magazine\u201d and a firm belief that watching reruns of Full House will explain the pre-history of today\u2019s college students). Instead, let\u2019s focus on Parents Weekend, when instructors like me can expect nattering, officious parents to pop in to my classroom unannounced, sit in the front row (often in front of their children) and assert their parently prerogatives to participate.\nFor tenured faculty, this experience can be a source of great fun. One professor in my department couldn\u2019t wait for parents to visit his class on religion and literature, in which he invited them to engage him in questions of faith and scriptural \u201ctruth.\u201d He didn\u2019t consider himself to have done any good if at least a few parents didn\u2019t leave red-faced and even more certain that the academy was under the sway of atheists and intellectual profligates.\nFor the rest of us, though, parents weekend can inaugurate a hellish semester. On the basis of having \u201cmet\u201d me, some parents often then feel empowered to call the director of freshman writing or the chair of the dept throughout the rest of the semester (and, naturally, once grades have been turned in) to challenge pretty much any aspect of the course that Ian and Laura have found objectionable, \u201cunfair\u201d (this usually involves unquantifiables like what \u201cgood writing\u201d is) or just unduly difficult. After all, undergraduate degrees are means, not ends, you know, and I really need a good grade in this course if I\u2019m going to get that internship or study-abroad fellowship or acceptance to law school.\nI could go on but I think I detest the bitterness and cynicism this brings out in me more than I actually detest these meddling parents and their student-children, still firmly attached at the teat.\nUpshot: I don\u2019t think I\u2019d call this a trend, because though the bad moments leave their imprimatur on your memory, they are far outnumbered (if not always outweighed) by the classes and semesters that go ok. But if mistakenly trendifying something that\u2019s probably more accurately described as an annoying symptom of contemporary American social and culture life is what it takes to shame people into removing themselves to a more appropriate distance from their children\u2019s education, I\u2019m willing to pay that price."
