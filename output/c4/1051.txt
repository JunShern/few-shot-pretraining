You may submit multiple entries, but please be considerate of your fellow players and don't go too overboard. In the case of multiple entries, you will still receive one prize at most.\nSince the events \"(f)Easter\" and \"April Fool's Day\" fall on the same day this year please design a card that works together with any of the Feast of Abundance Cards and embodies April fool's day.\nDon't forget to name the card you are supporting with your card.\nthere are very few Feast of Abundance cards and this is open enough that you really shouldn't need these. Don't be afraid to revisit cards already picked up by other competitors to add your own spin to them. Should the next one get revealed while this contest is running (i hope so) you can use that one, too.\n1: Conciseness - One of the main reasons many of the cards didn't take in the \"It's your Card\" Thread - try to be concise - during the Dev Stream they talked about \"less than 7 lines of text on cards\"\nThe post was edited 1 time, last by SlayerStronghold: added prizes ( Mar 27th 2018, 12:40pm ).\nDeploy - Five random cards in opposing champion's deck or hand secretly get \"When you play this, interrupt it. Summon a Llama.\"\n\"The boonberries have slightly different traditions for the feast of abundance\"\nYour Prankster Plums instead have \"When you play this, interrupt it. Summon a Llama. Then, create a Prankster Plums and put it in the opposing champion's hand.\"\nYour Prankster Plums have 'when this is discarded or buried, play it for free'.\nAbility: Escalate: Conscript 1 card that was released during a holiday event.\nEquipment for Feet: Artificial Nature - Add 10 shards to your deck when an Egg of Growth's effect activates with no shards in your deck after the first time you play Hodgepodge Effort.\nEquipment for Head: Replant Calculations - Add all Symeon's Bounties in your crypt and void to your deck when you play a Fruit of Symeon after the first time you play Hodgepodge Effort.\nDeploy: Create 4 EggFruit and put them into your deck.\n: Create 2 EggFruit and put them into your deck.\nWhen this enters your hand, play this for free.\nDeploy: This transforms into a Snack Pack, Snack Attack, or Attack Pack at random.\nYou gain 2 health for each EggFruit played this game.\nDeal 1 damage to target troop or champion for each EggFruit played this game.\nDeploy: This gets +1 /+1 for each EggFruit played this game.\nFor Attack Pack, I'm drawing inspiration from the egg with claws and eyes in a basket as seen on the 2017 Feast of Abundance sleeve.\nYour EggFruits instead have \"Deploy: This transforms into two of the following at random: Snack Pack, Snack Attack, or Attack Pack.\"\n\"Deploy: Create 8 EggFruit and put them into your deck. Draw a card.\n: Create 4 EggFruit and put them into your deck. Draw a card.\"\nEdit: Whoops.

Void this.\nSummon a copy of every Feaster egg control by each opposing champion under that champion's control. If an opposing champion don't have any Feaster egg under their control, summon 2 random Feaster egg under that champion's control.\nCreate a copy for each Fruit of Symeon in the opposing champion deck and put them into their deck. If there is no Fruit of Symeon in the opposing champion deck, create 2 Fruit of Symeon and put them into their deck.\nWhen this enters your crypt, lose 1 health and put the top card of your deck into that zone. Void this.\nYour Shall you be a fool ? instead have: Escalation - Put 2 random fool's curse into the enemy deck and then bury 2 card from opposing champion deck.\nDouble all numerical value of each Feaster curse.\nThe card can support itself or boost both the \"Egg Hunt\" or \"Symeon's Bounty\" Feaster card.\nFeaster curse doesn't escalate, their number are bold only to show which value are double by the equipment.\nThe post was edited 3 times, last by skinotik ( Mar 28th 2018, 9:35am ).\n: A random opposing troop secretly gets \"When this exhausts, revert and transform it into a Dingler. Revert it again at the start of your turn.\"\nThis is generally a playful and foolish card, but it plays particularly well with Blindside as the Prankster exhausts at quick speed and is good with repeated use.\nX times: A random opposing troop battles a random troop you control.\nThis card is fun and interesting, but bonkers when paired with the new Beast of Abundance. The X let's you Rowdy it up as you wish. The battles make the Beast useful before he's had enough to eat.\nThe post was edited 1 time, last by faceremover: Added stats for the prankster. ( Apr 6th 2018, 2:50pm ).\nWhile the Vennen have been moving away from putting Eggs into decks, seeing my deck get filled with spiderling eggs always filled me with dread.\nSo here's a card that lets you make a fool of Spiderling decks (and really any other opponent that is putting banes into your deck). In addition, being quick means you can respond to an instance of an opponent putting cards into your deck. And if your opponent isn't cooperating by creating cards, you can always do so yourself, such as with Symeon's Bounty, the Cleric champion's ability, etc. Lastly, the Fingerpainters equipment works particularly well with Egg Hunt finally giving you the cards to play with all of those wild shards you are getting.\nWhenever a card is created and put into your deck, transform the created card into a random Feaster Egg.\n\"Silly Vennen. Their eggs are are so gross and icky. They really should try painting them with rainbows.\"\nYour Egg Painters have \"Deploy - Transform each bane in your deck into a random Feaster Egg.\"\nWhen a Feaster Egg enters play, summon a Fool's Egg for each opposing champion.\nWhen you play a Fruit of Symeon, put between 1 and 3 Fool's Eggs in each opposing champion's deck.\nWhen this enters your hand, play it for free.\nDraw 1-3 cards and transform all drawn cards into random cards of a different shard.\nLose 1 Charge and 1 Temporary Resource.\nLose 1-3 Health. For each health you lose this way, discard a card at random.\nObviously, this synergizes with Symeon's Bounty and Egg Hunt.\nSince I didn't actually properly read the design constraint for my first entry, let's make a better one.\nCreate five 'Planted Evidence' in each opposing champion's deck.\nExhaust this -> Choose one at random: A random opposing troop gets -1/-1 and gets stunned, or create 3 feaster eggs and put them into your deck, or summon a random feaster egg.\nThis one supports Egg Hunt, and is based off the alternate artwork of Sylvan Springs, where I think Timophy can be seen stealing someone's underwear. The thematic idea is that, as a prank, he plants the evidence with the opposing champion, victim finds out, and starts tossing eggs with minimal accuracy!\nThe post was edited 1 time, last by Firellius ( Apr 3rd 2018, 10:18pm ).\nDeploy - Summon 2 Cheery Songbird.\nAll Cheery Songbird you control gain .\nAt the start of your turn, one random Cheery Songbird you control gains until the end of the turn.\n\"Welcome to the Birdemic ya bird brains!\"\nYour Bag O' Birds instead have, \"Deploy - Summon 3 Cheery Songbird.\"\nYour Bag O' Birds gain, \" : When a Cheery Songbird deals combat damage to an opposing champion, you may sacrifice this constant to create 2 Bag O' Birds and put them into your hand.\nThis constant focuses on using Cheery Songbirds for offensive play. The buff on a buffed songbird will trigger the effects of the other songbirds. Equipping the Birdseed Maracas add in a lethal tempo to your birds, gradually increasing the size of their party. Also, Tealwing is best bird husbando.\nEdit: Edited the theme to be around the (bad) Birdemic movie for a comedy holiday.\nThe post was edited 4 times, last by HaughtyHeretic ( Apr 6th 2018, 6:28pm ).\nTransform target Feaster Egg you control into a random Trickster Egg and put it under target opponent champion's control.\n\"Happy Feaster Fool's Day! Hehehehe....\"\nInvisible Prankster's Cloak(Chest): Your Feaster Tricksters instead have: Transform up to 3 Feaster Eggs.\nBalloon \"10 Tons\" Hammer(Weapon): Your Feaster Tricksters have : When a Feaster Egg enters play under your control, ready this.\nAt the start of your turn sacrifise this. Stun a random troop you control.\nAt the start of your turn sacrifice this.Transform a random troop you control into a Dingler. It gets \"At the start of your turn, revert this.\"\nAt the start of your turn sacrifice this. Add 3 Burning Counters yourself.\nAt the start of your turn sacrifice this. Discard a random card.\nAt the end of every turn, move each Fruit of Symeon and Symeon's Bounty in your deck up five spaces. Then, look at the top three cards of your deck. Put a revealed Fruit of Symeon or Symeon's Bounty into your hand.\n\"The Shin'hare offered spoils from their Spring harvest to Oinkers in the form of wine and fruit, then slaughtered fattened swine to use as the centerpiece for their Feast of Abundance.\"\nUnbuckeled Belt (Trinket) (Rare)- When you play Fruit of Symeon, put it back into your deck instead of voiding it.\nSecond Helping (Head) (Legendary)- When you play Fruit of Symeon, if you already played Fruit of Symeon this turn, add a dazed counter to the opposing champion.\nQuestions about entries and one day before the end of the contest warning. YOU can still add entries!\nif this wasn't an action with a deploy trigger this would work well together with Symeon's Bounty's additional draws.\nslightly over-designed and each of them is on the limit of the conciseness restraint. Otherwise fine.\nyour generated card is slightly too wordy, i would need to deduct points for not being concise.\nHow does this support Egg Hunt? All i see is a troop that wants to use it's ability.\nAny card i have not mentioned in this post is within the design constraints.\nI will start judging in 24h 9min from this post.\nIt's equally wordy to the cards its based off of.\nFruit of Symeon, for example, has virtually identical text(slightly different effects but the same concept), except it is an action so it doesn't come into play. I suppose I could make these actions, but that removes the tie to the feaster eggs.\nI could've split it into 3 different fool's eggs, but that felt unnecessary for the card.\nBeing concise is one of the judging criteria.\nBut again. 5 lines of text, to provide an opposite component to the five lines of text on the card it's mirroring.\nIt would make the card fit less if I were to remove text from it. I'm not denying it's a large card, but if you have a card that is based off of a large card that is trying to provide almost a 'mirror' to the large card... it makes sense for it to be a large card. And it doesn't cross the '7 lines of text' threshold that is the soft limit for a Hex card.\nI'm just explaining WHY I did it the way I did, I can't change the way you judge it, but I'm not going to ruin the thematics or effectiveness of the card simply to make it concise. If you choose to hold that against me, it's your contest and that's completely fair.\nThe post was edited 1 time, last by Eraia ( Apr 6th 2018, 3:42pm ).\nThis entry is no longer relevant, as I made a new one that better fits the design constraint.\nThat said, the Prankster Plums play an April Fool's prank on the enemy champion by boobytrapping their cards. That's the April Fool's link.\nWhen this exhausts for the first time each turn, ready Debon'hare and each troop that exhausted at the same time.\nI don't like cards that are too narrow, so ideally, I've worded this ability so that it would trigger on a normal attack.\n- Lovers' link (trinket)If exactly one other troop exhausts when Debon'hare exhausts, summon a Battle Hopper.\n- \"Best Dad\" mug (weapon)If exactly two other troops exhaust when Debon'hare exhausts, those troops and Debon'hare all get +1/+1.\n1: concise - The created card is too wordy, otherwise fine.\n2: Theme: April Fool's - A fowl that is a fool, i guess.\n2: Theme: April Fool's - barely. Grifting is not something that happens on this day more often than usual... unless you meant to use graft, in which case it would have failed the theme.\n3: Synergy - would work nicely to remove the surplus fruits before decking you.\n2: Theme: April Fool's - what exactly is a prank-fest? at least it has prank in the name.\n3: Synergy - Best synergy. not only does it work extremely well, it also isn't useless on it's own.\n2: Theme: April Fool's - an evil prank to play on someone, but then - they are shin'hare.\n3: Synergy - Works extremely well with Symeon's bounty.\n2: Theme: April Fool's - He pranks people by turning them into dinglers.\n3: Synergy - yes, readying after exhaust effects is useful. Could be improved, though.\n2: Theme: April Fool's - putting birds into bags definitely fits.\nThe post was edited 3 times, last by SlayerStronghold ( Apr 7th 2018, 2:02pm )."
