Here are just a few of the exciting changes, you can learn about all the changes for the Silverado and all of Chevrolet\u2019s models at Len Stoler Chevrolet.\nThe 2019 Silverado 1500 is bigger and lighter than its predecessor, with a wheelbase that\u2019s 3.9 inches longer than the 2018 version. Overall length is up as well, with the new truck being 1.6 inches longer than before.\nPassengers rejoice! The Silverado\u2019s larger footprint improves rear-seat comfort in the four-door crew cab, legroom grows from 40.9 inches to 43.8 inches. Along with the additional leg room, Chevy also added two large storage bins in the rear seatbacks, as well as storage space under the rear seat bottoms.\nA new roll-formed, high-strength steel bed floor is 1.5 times the strength of the previous one and has 12 stationary tie-downs that are double the strength of the ones on the previous truck. Another set of nine removable tie-downs will be offered as an accessory.\nThe 2019 Silverado will have a choice of six different powertrain combinations. Two new gasoline V-8 engines, a 5.3-liter unit and a 6.2-liter, all this means improved efficiency by way of General Motors\u2019 new Dynamic Fuel Management system, which can cut fuel flow to between one and seven cylinders as conditions permit.\nWith a steeper windshield and roof spoiler, the new Silverado has an aerodynamic efficiency despite riding an inch higher than previous models.\nCustom trims are available on all models of the 2019 Silverado making it easy to customize your new ride and give it a little personality!\nThese are just a few of the changes you\u2019ll see in the 2019 Chevy Silverado. For a complete list of changes and for all the custom trims and accessories connect with Len Stoler Chevrolet. They can help you customize the Chevy of your dreams and set you up to be one of the first ones to test drive a 2019 model when they arrive in the showroom."
