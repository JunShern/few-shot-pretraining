    "text": "It started in 1992, with a back problem that would require surgery and a 3 to 6 week recovery to restore my daily functioning and relieve my pain. Immediately after the surgery I knew something went seriously wrong. From that day on, my life and family was forever changed, but was definitely not ruined or wasted.\nIn the spring of 1993, Debbie and I were introduced to a faith in God in a very different way than how we were taught growing up. We started off applying the principles and values that we were learning into our everyday family life, and almost immediately we began to see a change. Our marriage grew healthy, stable, and strong; and family life with our two children was no longer out of control. We went from a potential divorce to a workable and agreed upon game plan that followed the teachings and beliefs of the Bible. Our life did not get easier, however. I was permanently disabled (I was also diagnosed with Fibromyalgia in 1999); our income was drastically reduced; and we lost our home, my pension, and our medical benefits. Despite all this, our faith continued to grow, and we made it our mission to live out the \u201cLove thy Neighbor\u201d principle as a way to share our faith in a very tangible way.\nFrom our introduction to faith in 1993 to years later in 2007, I received a biblically-based education from Moody Bible College, did some basic study with the American Association of Christian Counselors, served in youth ministry, and began ministering to marriages that were in need of help. After these years of extensive volunteer ministry work, I began to feel the calling to start a ministry of hope.\nIt was this same year in 2007, while ministering in a nursing home to a person I had never met before, I was asked by the nurse why I was there and why I cared about a complete stranger. Without thinking, I shared from Hebrews 6:19, which implies that no one should leave this world alone or scared. Instead, we have this anchor that is a hope for our soul, firm and secure, and that hope comes from understanding why faith in Jesus Christ matters above all things. With all of these things coming together, Hope for the Soul was officially born.\nThe hidden part of the story is how God uses me to do all these things on a daily basis while in constant pain. I require extensive chiropractic adjustments weekly and daily 2-4 hour rehabilitative time in order to maintain my mobility and health. In 1999, I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, and since then have also had to deal with the repercussions of that disease every day.\nAlthough I am not licensed, I\u2019ve learned that God says a great deal about receiving wise counsel. I do not believe in giving simple answers to complicated questions. I also work hand in hand with a Licensed Professional Counselor and Supervisor (LPCC-S) to offer me wisdom when I need it, and to consult with on a regular basis for ongoing accountability and growth opportunities. In addition, those with more complicated needs can receive the best opportunity for help and change clinically, spiritually, and holistically in this way. As for me, I have a testimony that serves as an example of \u201cIf God can do it for me, He can do it for you too.\u201d I believe that by connecting people\u2019s stories with others who have gone through the process before them, it creates a healthy path for hope and healing, even from long-lasting generational dysfunction. When others witness a miracle unfold in one person\u2019s struggle, it proves it can happen in others\u2019 lives as well. God has given me the ability to share my story along with teaching about God\u2019s love and mercy in order to show others the power of faith, the need for daily direction; and ultimately, lead them to a hope for their souls. Never did I imagine that my simple story would morph Hope for the Soul into what it is today."
