    "text": "Every day I throw away ten things. I know that sounds like a lot, but if you look at your home, really look at it, you\u2019re bringing in more than than ten items a day.\nSome days I toss ten scraps from a handbag or ten bits from a junk drawer. Other days I\u2019ll go through one of our closets and make a bag of ten items for a friend or a charity.\nI decided on ten because it\u2019s a workable number. Some days I spend a few moments clearing the house of junk, other days it\u2019s an hour of organizing and finding the the ten items (maybe in a linen closet or a toybox). I like setting goals and I love being able to accomplish them.\nI noticed when my kids were smaller that they\u2019d stopped playing with their toys. They would look at the masses of stuff and become overwhelmed. As soon as I began removing some of the clutter from the playroom, the kids felt free to play.\nFor the past few years I\u2019ve asked the kids to help find ten items. Every couple of weeks I\u2019ll ask Jane or Alexander to give me ten items for charity. Sometimes I\u2019m surprised what they give me, sometimes I\u2019m upset that I\u2019ve spent a lot of money on something that they don\u2019t want or enjoy. Once in a while I believe they\u2019re making a mistake and ask them to keep what they\u2019d like to give away; each time that happens, I am wrong. When the kids are wanting new clothes or toys (that they don\u2019t need) I\u2019ll do a ten for one. If they give me ten items they\u2019re ready to part with, I\u2019ll buy them one new something. The kids are happy, and they tend to choose well this way.\nThat\u2019s a good idea! I\u2019m not a pack rat and love throwing things away but there are some closets that I need to tackle.\nooooh I love this idea! I definetly moved more than 10 things today, but I bet I could easily get 5 for 1 on new goodies from my kids\u2026they\u2019re only 2 and 6, so 5 is probably more workable for them. But I love instilling the idea that if new things come in, old ones must go out as well.\nThis is a great idea! And Lord knows I have WAY more than 10 things I can part with. But 10 is do-able. I can do this!\nGreat idea\u2014if I had done this years ago, I wouldn\u2019t have needed to start Cluttercast in the first place.\nMy husband and I de-cluttered all weekend\u2026Labor Day weekend! What a way to spend the holiday, right? I love this idea and will be passing this along to my friends as well. In your honor, I am now off to bag up 10 nonperishables to take to our foodbank!\nOh yes, a wonderful idea\u2013just yesterday I threw away ten empty bottles.\nWe do a major decluttering just before Rosh Hashanah and Pesach.\nIn between there are periodic events in which things are removed. Really if the kids stopped growing that would make it easier.\nSmall bodies fit bitter inside the house. But since they refuse to listen to the stop growing part I suppose I should step up the clutter, er clearing the clutter bit.\nGreat, great idea. I\u2019ve started watching \u201cHoarders\u201d on A&E and am so horrified I\u2019ve started seeing every innocent tangle of legos on the floor as a potential gateway to clutter hell! This is an unintimidating way to tackle every day messes before they get out of hand.\nI actually sometimes do the \u201c27 pickup\u201d which means I run around with the garbage bag and find 27 things to throw away. This was inspired by the Flylady. I usually get it done once a month, but this is a new school year, and I\u2019m working these types of things into my new routine!\nIt works wonders when you do it regularly, doesn\u2019t it?\nI also do something similar to this with Flylady routines which have saved my house from certain disaster! One of my favourite things is the declutter routine (15 minutes only, once a day). It\u2019s amazing how quickly you\u2019ll get through the whole house.\nIt kind of sounds like you\u2019re missing something here.. \u201cten scraps from a handbag or ten bits from a junk drawer\u201d. If the issue is that you don\u2019t like clutter, get rid of ALL the scraps in your handbag, and get rid of the junk drawer. It sounds like you\u2019re doing a half-assed job at tidying a mess that doesn\u2019t need to exist.\nHow am I missing something? Not every day can be spring cleaning, but if you do a little bit each day, and find a manageable number then it\u2019s less daunting and becomes a habit as opposed to a chore."
