    "text": "True Tex-Mex Cuisine\u2019s Long Adios\u2014Texas Monthly: This piece tracing the ins and outs of the Tex-Mex restaurant scene (mostly in Houston) over the past few decades is essentially my life\u2019s story in restaurants. The longer I spend away, the more likely I am to want to head to Ninfa\u2019s on Navigation or Molina\u2019s or El Real first (or Matt\u2019s El Rancho in Austin) than I am to want Pico\u2019s or Hugo\u2019s or Saz\u00f3n. One thing I worry about when people talk about Tex-Mex, and it\u2019s present in this essay, is the conflation of the food culture of Tex-Mex restaurants initially designed to serve a primarily Anglo clientele with the \u201cTex-Mex food\u201d generally. There\u2019s good reason for that as the genrification of that menu happened in restaurants, but it\u2019s important also to remember the Tex-Mex foodways that predate this Anglicized menu (call them \u201cTejano\u201d foodways?). They are related, but distinct. Robb Walsh\u2019s Tex-Mex Cookbook is the best example I know of letting them share the spotlight.\nJust five bucks a month: Gina Trapani\u2019s writeup of the exhausting process of having to write and rewrite the billing platform for ThinkUp seven times in the first year and a half or so of the product\u2019s life was reminiscent of my own experience (on a smaller scale) with The Appendix and our billing and subscription needs. This is an essential story to keep in mind for anyone considering writing a service that involves recurring billing. I\u2019m going to keep it in front of mind as I work on what comes next in the coming months.\nI picked this up as an easy read having seen Glenn Fleishman recommend it on Twitter a few weeks ago. Having independently discovered that reality is only a computer simulation to which they have access to the main configuration repository, a collection of geeks find they\u2019ve all had the idea to time travel to medieval England and pose as magicians with their new powers. For my tastes, the light humor element could have been less prominent in favor working through the consequences of the central conceit in more detail, but it was fun, easy, and great for picking up at odd hours with a newborn in the house. This is also the first book I\u2019ve bought on one of Amazon\u2019s inhouse imprints, and I was impressed by the presentation. I imagine I\u2019ll eventually pick up the next one in the Magic 2.0 series.\nThese ten short provocations about living online and in a digital age cover ethics and etiquette in roughly equal parts all to set up the core \u2018command\u2019 that to participate in this world with purpose one must understand the perspective gained from understanding programming. I find this conclusion\u2014that everyone could benefit from the perspective gained from relatively short exposure to programming\u2014a great corrective to the \u201cEveryone must code!\u201d evangelism. Given that the book was published in 2011, however, I wonder how much of just that brand of evangelism comes from a misunderstanding of the subtleties of Rushkoff\u2019s argument. Regardless, the collection of questions about digital age ethics put me in a good frame of mind for approaching some of the post-dissertation projects I\u2019ve been working on recently."
