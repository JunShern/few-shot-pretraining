    "text": "Last week I went to see a late movie after work with a friend. Finishing quite late at 10.30pm, we had real difficulty finding good food at that hour. Knowing that Korean restaurants open quite late, we took the chance to try out Funny Funny, which has long been on my to try list. Situated along George street, we headed upstairs to the dining area.\nOf course stopping to take a gratuitous picture of their infamous graffiti.\nGrabbing a table on the loft, we admired the creative designs on the wall, no doubt by staff and customers.\nAs with most Korean restaurants, the menu was super extensive, and we had slight difficulties in making our choice that night. Service was by buzzer, but unfortunately our buzzer was broken and we had a lot of issue waving down staff. Additionally the loud music also made it quite difficult for us to continue our conversation.\nOur side dishes that night comprised of kimchi, spicy tofu, sesame seaweed and pickled turnip. Whilst they were all enjoyable, my favourite was without a doubt the seaweed which was infused with fragrant sesame oil.\nBeing famous for fried chicken, we got a portion of the boneless KFC, half and half with soy and garlic. In all honesty, the chicken was quite underwhelming for us, for a number of reasons. Firstly the flavours were not very apparent, whilst we could taste bits of garlic and soy here and there, it wasn\u2019t strong enough and wasn\u2019t consistent. Secondly the chicken itself was a little soggy from some of the basting covering it, which really disappointed me (although my I didnt have as much regret as when I eat Momo and break out for two weeks afterwards). Portion wise, it was quite generous but I would prefer if they had KFC in a single size portion.\nOur other dish to share was the Wagyu Beef bibimbap, which was even more disappointing than the fried chicken. The stone pot was hardly hot enough to even sear the beef, and the chef had completely forgotten to add salt to the dish. Otherwise the salads were fresh and the rice was ample."
