That means policy, mobile device management (MDM) technology and governance. But with 50 MDM solutions and 10 tablet and smartphone vendors on the market, where do you start? Meet a leading IT architect, who conducted a thorough evaluation of all the options in 2011 before arriving at his recommendations for a 50,000-employee company. In this session, you will get a glimpse into his analysis of the MDM market, discuss the corporate vs. personal ownership model and foster group discussion around what has worked\u2014and what hasn't\u2014in mobile management for both the enterprise and end users.\nWhen it comes to mobile device strategies and policies, one size doesn't fit all.
