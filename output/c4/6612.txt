    "text": "Content. It correlates to success or epic failure in today\u2019s digital word.\nContent isn\u2019t just words; content can be videos, social posts, website, blogs, newsletters and digital communication with customers. Helping create content is what we do at The High Road Agency.\nMore than 2/3 of marketing professional struggle in creating meaningful content for their company\u2019s brand. There is also the challenge of effective means to deliver the content to consumers \u2013 but let\u2019s focus on the former first for this blog. Identifying the audience, consumer and platform will help guide you for content creation.\nIn creating content for multiple platforms, there is not a \u201cone size fits all\u201d solution for creating content. Yes, the content can all compliment and visually relate but. For example, the same image used on Facebook must be edited in size for use on Instagram. A video used on certain types of social media will likely be different in length than a broadcast commercial or website. A blog that is written for a consumer website isn\u2019t the same content format that a media outlet might need.\nPosting ten times on social media does not equate to great content or increased engagement. In fact, posting irrelevant or too much content can have the opposite effect. And once a customer is lost or hits the forbidden \u201cUnfollow\u201d button, the chances of obtaining that person back is nearly impossible. On Facebook, a few times a week versus Twitter which can be a few times a day."
