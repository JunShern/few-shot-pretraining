    "text": "There is so much to be done as a self-publisher, and while I wouldn\u2019t dare pretend that I can tell everyone how they should do things, I\u2019m more than happy to share with you the steps I took ahead of my first book\u2019s release.\nHire an editor \u2014 There are two things that often separate traditionally published novels versus the self-published ones \u2014 cover design and editing. That said, if you don\u2019t want your book to be seen as amateurish, then make sure you get those two things right. I\u2019ll talk about cover design further down this list, but as for the professional editing, once you feel you have done your best in getting your novel to its final form, hire a reputable editor and send your manuscript to them. (I\u2019ve got an entire post about why everyone needs to hire a copy editor\u2014indie or traditional. Click here to read it.) Once it\u2019s out of your hands for 4-6 weeks, you can get started on the business end of self-publishing.\nSet up a publishing company \u2014 Hopefully, you\u2019ve already decided on whether or not you want to set up your own publishing company. I did, and I have set up a website for it \u2014 Seaport Publishing. If you go this route, you\u2019ll need to decide on whether or not you want to set up a formal business structure \u2014 either as a sole proprietor, LLC, or something more complex. I read in the 2014 Guide to Self-Publishing that for most self-published authors, a sole proprietorship is the business model of choice. I\u2019m not a CPA or a tax professional, so I can dispense no advice in this regard. I can only tell you that if you haven\u2019t already, you need to ask yourself if you plan to take this writing business seriously. If you do, then you should manage it seriously. Have a separate account set up especially for your writing expenses and revenue, and keep records of everything so that when tax time comes around, you\u2019ll be ready to report on your earnings (if you have any) and your expenses \u2014 things like that receipt for your Scrivener software, that fountain pen and those composition books, your subscription to Writer\u2019s Digest, or your domain name and website hosting.\nEstablish your Print-on-Demand (POD) and eBook accounts \u2014 This is a great time to set up your accounts with Amazon\u2019s CreateSpace, Ingram\u2019s IngramSpark, and Barnes & Noble\u2019s NookPress. I know there are lots of other self-publishing platforms out there, but those are the three big ones. In terms of print, I use CreateSpace only for selling books via Amazon.com and IngramSpark for everything else. Here\u2019s a great article that makes the case for why and how you should use those two services together. As for ebooks, I\u2019ll be sticking with KDP for now.\nBuy your ISBNs and barcodes \u2014 There\u2019s a lot to know here. In fact, maybe I\u2019ll write a post about this in the near future. For the sake of keeping this article succinct, however, I\u2019ll just say that since I want to be sure I can have my print book available anywhere that wants to carry it, I have purchased a set of 10 ISBNs and just one barcode (for now) from Bowker. Bowker is the ISBN-assigning agency for the United States. If you live in a different country, you\u2019ll need to do an online search for which agency you should use. Just to clarify, I\u2019ll only need one ISBN and barcode for my novel, unless I decide to release it in both paperback and hardcover formats, in which case I\u2019ll need to have a unique ISBN and barcode for each format. I do not recommend using CreateSpace to get your ISBN, even though they offer that service. Unless you want Amazon\u2019s CreateSpace to be the publisher-of-record for your book, you\u2019ll want to buy your own ISBNs. You can get them in bulk from Bowker.\nDesign your cover \u2014 This part can be tricky. Both CreateSpace and IngramSpark offer template-based cover designing, but if you want a wrap around cover (like the one I\u2019ll be using for The Smuggler\u2019s Gambit), you\u2019ll need to know how many pages your finished book will be before you can download a cover design template. In the short term, if you already know what you want the front cover to look like, and you\u2019re not very comfortable using Photoshop, you can use a free service like Canva to build it.\nBuild your platform \u2014 Really, truly, you should have already been working on this while you\u2019ve been in the process of writing your novel, but at this point, you need to amp up your platform-building activity. While your manuscript is with your editor, now might be a good time to talk to local booksellers about stocking your book. Maybe a good way to approach them is with a nice-quality printout of your book\u2019s cover. Ask them if they think the design is an attention-grabbing one. This is also a good time to get your author page set up on Facebook and decide on the other social media sites that you think you might want to plug into.\nDecide on a tentative release date \u2014 By the time you\u2019ve gotten all of those things done, you may very well have your manuscript back from your editor. Depending on the changes that he suggests, you still have more work to do. Once you\u2019ve integrated your editor\u2019s changes into your final manuscript, it will be time to decide on a release date. Spring is traditionally a big time for book releases, but depending on the subject matter of your novel, you may actually want to time your book\u2019s release differently. For instance, my first novel takes place in May of 1765, and since it was due to be released in 2015 \u2014 exactly 250 years after the story\u2019s events \u2014 I wanted to be sure my book was out far enough ahead of May to gain some traction with readers.\nOnce you\u2019ve gotten all of these steps taken care of, you\u2019ll hopefully be ready to dive into publishing.\nYou have worked so hard on dreaming up your story, and writing it, and editing it, and refining it. Now isn\u2019t the time to get exhausted and do things half-way. Whether or not your independently-published book is as successful as it can be depends entirely on you. Part of the beauty of self-publishing \u2014 total control \u2014 can also be the beast of self-publishing. If you get impatient and try to do things in a hurry, or without doing your homework, you\u2019re only going to end up cheating yourself of what could otherwise be a more successful venture. On the other hand, if you give your novel\u2019s publication all of the care and attention it deserves \u2014 ensuring that it\u2019s the very best it can possibly be \u2014 then you can know that, by God\u2019s grace, you did that. An agent didn\u2019t do that for you. A big, traditional publishing house didn\u2019t do that for you. You did."
