    "text": "Why would we want to prosecute abusive police officers? Because we aren\u2019t talking about whether all police officers are good or bad. They come in both varieties and we must prosecute the bad ones to respect and help the good ones. We need to recognize the difference so we can better appreciate the good and put an end to the bad.\nI recently shared a post from Father James Martin S.J. on Facebook in which he points out that holding a bad officer responsible for abusive behavior is not to be against all officers in general, but against abuse. I\u2019ll go a step further and say that\u2019s it\u2019s a necessity to hold bad officers accountable so that we further differentiate between the two. It is disrespectful in the extreme to every good upstanding police officer to let any overzealous, abusive or criminal officer get away with violence, much less with murder.\nThere are often stories of police officers who are amazing! I revel in those stories and I enjoy seeing and sharing them on my social media streams. I appreciate so much every officer who takes the job of policing our communities seriously and serves us with their best. Thank God for good police officers! Here are a couple of recent inspiring stories, officers who go the extra mile for people: With Food & Mercy and With Simple Courtesy.\nI respect police officers so much. But I\u2019m also going to downtown DC on Saturday to march with everyone else who gathers to protest police brutality. I don\u2019t march because all police officers are bad. I march with families who have lost loved ones to bad policing. I march in memory of Michael Brown and Eric Garner, whose lives matter, and whose lives should not have been taken, and whose deaths are real and terrible.\n~ I will march because of the lack of indictments for the officers who killed Mr. Brown and Mr. Garner (and so many others). Those missing indictments should scare every single person in this country, black, white, brown, yellow, male, female, etc etc. Can we be so dismissive of gun violence and the brutality of being choked to death that we just go on with our lives? Can two unarmed U.S. citizens be killed on our streets and our justice system simply choose not to address their deaths? Changes are needed.\n~ I will march because so many of my friends here in their own country feel disrespected, disenfranchised, targeted and unsafe. Good good people are hurting because we haven\u2019t learned to live together better than this. They carry a burden every day and every time they enter the public arena. I march on Saturday to show my solidarity with them. I march because I love them.\n~ I will march because peace and a better tomorrow cannot come from simply ignoring the problems of today. We cannot dismiss this conversation away or ignore the pain and pleas of our neighbors just because it\u2019s more sensational (or self-justifying) to focus on the rioters and looters.\n~ And finally, I will march out of hope and a dream of peace, not out of anger or seeking violence. I\u2019m not looking for a fight, but for an honest recognition that we have some real work ahead of us to bring justice to all our people. I will head downtown Saturday with a prayer on my heart and lips that God keeps the violent at bay and holds us all in check, so that voices might be easier heard than dismissed.\nYou don\u2019t have to march on Saturday, but I sure wish you would. I sure wish you\u2019d raise your voice with all the hurting people who cry for justice, for explanations, for hope for their children. I wish we\u2019d all choose to work harder to speak for one another, seeing ourselves as our brother\u2019s keeper and our sister\u2019s keeper and the whole human family as our kin and beloved ones. We do not have separate futures in this country, but one shared and connected journey. Our children and grandchildren need us to secure the freedom, equality, safety and justice of that future in every way we can. We\u2019ll only fully realize that hope when we work together.\nThis entry was posted in Just Life, Social Justice and tagged Eric Garner, Michael Brown, National March, peace, Police Brutality, Respect for Police, Social Justice.\nWill We Live Up To Their Faith in Us?\nI\u2019ve been thinking about the children on our Southern border and the need for us to move in a gracious, welcoming, valuing way to address their needs. But it\u2019s not just about their needs. I believe an essential part of who we are as a nation and a people is on the line.\nThe child immigration crisis in the South is a test of our nation\u2019s values, beliefs and future, and we run the risk of disappointing ourselves as much as neglecting these children. The more I try to hold all the facets of this problem in balance the more I am convinced that we face a unique moment of challenge and opportunity as a nation. Ten and twenty years from now, will we have a generation in our nation that includes these children, I\u2019ll call them Hopers, among us at universities, schools, workplaces and communities across our country? Or will we have a shameful memory of not responding to the hurt and pain of our most vulnerable neighbors?\nWhat is it that causes those parents to hope for so much from us? I\u2019m stumped trying to imagine what the parents of these children must experience in their daily lives at home and what they must imagine we will do as surrogates for their children. Why do they believe in us so deeply and so optimistically? I don\u2019t know, but I do believe this: We have not set a trajectory of hope or healing in our response to these children. We have been afraid and sometimes angry. It\u2019s time to change the conversation and set a new trajectory that will lead us all, all of us, to a blessed and shared future.\nCan we live up to what their parents have believed of us? Are we as good as we have believed? More and more I\u2019m beginning to be a Hoper, myself. I want to hope in us and believe in us, too! I want to see us face such a challenge and opportunity with an amazing grace and the poise of a nation that knows all too well about displacement and the painful legacy it leaves behind. We have this amazing opportunity to change the way we act as a species, a nation, a culture and as neighbors. It truly is one of the greatest tests of sharing that I think we have ever faced. And we can be amazing if we choose to be. I hope we shine.\nI know the arguments about lawful entry to our country. I understand the fear of validating the practice of just shipping children wholesale across the desert to our border. I get the worries, I understand the indignation, and I share some of the trepidation. We still have to hope. We need hope as much as these children need hope. We still have to act. We still must regard the sanctity of human life and our connection with all people as a central priority to safeguarding our own future, our shared future.\nLet\u2019s not fear anymore. Enough with the indignant outrage. Let\u2019s put aside our worry. Let\u2019s embrace these children and face tomorrow with them. They are here now. They are ours. They are us. Let\u2019s share the hope and belief in us of those parents.\nI don\u2019t have all the answers to the problem at the border, but we must respond with dignity, hope, love and concern for these children. We must respond, sooner than later. Let\u2019s shoulder the cost of welcoming. Pray. Sign petitions. Donate to relief work. Speak peace. Love these children.\n*Here\u2019s a timely warning about neglect and an example of creative thinking to find longer term solutions to problems like this, from David Gergan and Daniel Katz. I thought it was a good read, worth consideration.\nThis entry was posted in Just Life, Social Justice and tagged Action, Border Children, Compassion, future, Mercy, Petitions, Prayer, Social Justice."
