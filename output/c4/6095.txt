From there he went to the USDA/ARS Bee Breeding and Stock Lab, which in those days was preparing for the African bee to move across the border and enter the United States. Next, Jerry worked for Dadant, North America\u2019s largest beekeeping manufacturing and supply company, first as Regional Manager in Michigan and then at the home office in Hamilton, Illinois. While at Dadant he started writing the \"Classroom\" Q&A column for the American Bee Journal which in turn led to the book of the same name, Classroom. From 2004 until 2012, Jerry was the Chief of the Apiary Inspection Section of the Florida Department of Agriculture where he supervised the inspection of approximately 300,000 honey bee colonies and more than 2500 registered beekeepers, ranging from backyard enthusiasts to commercial migratory beekeepers with tens of thousands of colonies. He was one of the founding members of the Colony Collapse Working Group and so has intimate knowledge of CCD and honey bee health. He currently is at Monsanto working on a technology that uses a normal natural process called RNAi to see if it can be adapted to control honey bee parasites and pathogens safely, sanely and efficaciously. His personal goal is to be able to be a part of a team that uses this new technology to bring non-chemical Varroa control and the control of the Varroa/virus complex to our suffering and challenged industry.\nFor information on the next convention, click here."
