    "text": "Can you name all of John Terry's Premier League teammates at Chelsea?\nThere are over 150 names on the list - how many can you get?\nThis quiz will really test your memory of Chelsea players over the last few years.\nBack on 28 October 1998, a young John Terry made his Blues debut - coming on as a late substitute in a League Cup tie against Aston Villa.\nSince then, the centre back has had a whole host of teammates in a Chelsea shirt.\n157 of them, to be exact.\nSo, our quiz is quite simple in that sense - name all those players.\nOne rule before you get started though, this quiz is only counting those teammates that John terry has had in Premier League games - so you can forget any of those obscure names who only made a League Cup appearance for Chelsea.\nSo, without further ado, try your hand at our quiz below.\nConsider yourselves in our good books if you get over 75% of them."
