    "text": "Here are a few questions that HR professionals should ask when acquiring new technology.\nOver the last few years, technology has rapidly evolved specifically in the HR. The pace of change is fast not only because the world of HR is complex, but professionals are acknowledging many creative uses of technologies. It is bringing together aspects from the technology ecosystem and integrating them with HR problems.\nWhy undergo HR technology transformation?\nWork is becoming more meaningful.\nThere\u2019s an ability to pool multiple data from enterprise sources as well as public domain sources.\nWhat can HR do to Humanize Talent Technology?\nEmployees are no longer excited by monetary increments alone. Technology is creating a level playing field where employer branding is important because everything is externally visible. Once HR understands how technology impacts the behavior of employees, it will be able to make the shift.\nHR leaders need to understand how the larger context of social living is changing. That has always been the traditional role of HR \u2013 we have understood psychology, sociology and now technology is the third element for HR to understand.\nHow is talent technology enabling employees to perform better and simpler? For example, flexi-working is a hygiene factor today. It is not just about having a policy to allow people to work from anywhere, but also about enabling them to work from anywhere. Working from remote places, an employee should have access to the intuitive ease of an office environment, where he or she can reach out to any colleague. So, inculcating the social piece through human touch becomes important with a direct impact on engagement.\nHow do we make work more fun? More people are choosing to look at work as not just the primary source of income, but a source of enjoyment. How can real human beings (and not machines) create such an environment? The answer lies in the ability to build social connect, healthy competition, wellbeing etc. in an integrated employee experience.\nBringing the human element from a prescriptive perspective: The employee engagement question on Gallup tests, \u201cDo I have a friend at work?\u201d is highly relevant. When a person looks at a human being working alongside, he or she gives/receives advice and shares opinions as a friend, albeit a work friend. This seems to be possible only when you are working with humans. In a talent technology landscape, HR must create an environment which allows people to have such a human-connect feeling. Ask the question, \u201cCan a similar feeling be replicated on a social platform or HR platform?\u201d This will allow the technology-intelligence to give prescriptions that carry a human touch.\nWhat language are we talking in? Today, we have technologies that not only can prescribe certain things, but also prescribe them in a language that humans relate to. For example, chatbots allow us to ask queries through a machine but in natural language, not unrelatableprogramming language. HR should foster the next wave i.e. \u201cHow do you humanize through the language, (for example by using Natural Language Processing)?\u201d This will create a very real employee experience.\nSupport intuition: Intuition is a human characteristic. To humanize talent technology, HR should look for tech that supports this trait. A case in point in L&D is to deliver learning to employees right at the time when they need it. With regard to Talent Acquisition, it may mean understanding and looking into the new and untapped pools of talent. For performance management, it may translate to intuitively managing performance in real-time, i.e. measuring and enabling performance by, for example, building in coaching into the performance process. In the entire cycle of pre-hire to post-retire, HR must strive to build intuitive intelligence into every step.\nSuccess in humanizing talent technologies is all about the \u201chow\u201d. HR needs to learn to rely on data to take more informed decisions and build enabling systems so that employees are more engaged with technology and not fearful of it. The right blend of man (or woman) and machine will create a strong human connect to technology. To make that happen, integration is the key. Today, employees want the systems to enable whatever they want and not have to depend solely on HR as this siloed operation of HR is employees\u2019 biggest pain point.\nFirst impressions count, so you better make a good one!\nDo you really have a workforce strategy?"
