    "text": "Here's a guide for beginners to finding your first comet, just as Lovejoy comes into clear view.\nBy now, you\u2019ve probably seen the incredible images of amateur astronomer Terry Lovejoy\u2019s latest find. For a guy armed with just an eight-inch telescope, he\u2019s bagged an impressive five comets in the last seven years, three of which have been showstoppers at the eyepiece. His latest has brightened far beyond initial expectations, currently blazing at magnitude plus four in the faint constellation Eridanus. But you aren\u2019t Lovejoy, or yours truly. Why is it green? How the devil can John Q Anybody see this wondrous fuzzball?\nComet C/2014 Q2 Lovejoy takes on a striking appearance that at first seems out of the norm. When you think of a comet, you may think of a fiery white streak. That\u2019s the popular image, and a pretty good one: when a new comet that brightens enough to dazzle is announced, it is often that comet\u2019s first trek towards the sun. As a result, the dust and ice on and inside the comet\u2019s nucleus vaporizes and streaks off as it heats up, and this dusty layer reflects the sun\u2019s light, giving the comet its signature white look. Not all comets are the same, of course, and even those \u201cdiscovered\u201d have often been around the block a few times. In the case of Comet Lovejoy, very little dust is being produced, so the natural color of its head can be revealed. Diatomic carbon, not cyanogen, is the responsible party here, fluorescing in the UV sunlight and giving it that distinctive green glow.\nWhat you will see depends on four factors: weather, the moon, light pollution, and optics used; but you will certainly see it nearly anywhere if you have the right conditions: from the Battery in Manhattan or the Mall in DC, the fuzzy green coma will still appear on a clear night, through binoculars, and before the moon rises.\nFirst, the weather. Cloudy skies will obviously hinder your hunt, but transparency is just as important, so check out SkippySky when you plan to look. Second, the moon. On January 7, you will need to limit your observations locally to just a few hours between twilight and moonrise, but as the moon wanes and rises about an hour later each night, your window opens. You will enjoy a moonless view if you observe around 9 p.m., when Orion is dominating the southern sky, from about January 10 onward. Third, light pollution affects the view, like it does with nearly all astronomical observations. Check out DarkSiteFinder, or with your local astronomy club, to find a reasonable spot. Lastly, the optics you use will affect what you see dramatically. Naked-eye observing is limited to just a fuzzy green spot, and will only be possible from darker skies. Binoculars will be your best friend, allowing you to sweep across the sky in your hunt with ease. If you have a telescope, or know someone who does, you may pull out even finer details, such as the faint tail.\nConditions were far from ideal , it was very windy and cloudy with too much moonlight. In between the cloud gaps I caught a glimpse of the comet in my 10X50 \u2018s so I decided to set up my 25X100 \u2018s binoculars in hope of a sketch. In Ireland , it is always a possibility that this could be my only opportunity to sketch this comet for days or weeks. Engulfed in Virginia creeper twigs I waited for a break in the relentless fast moving cumulus. The coma was large, the nucleus looked kinda oblong, not a pinpoint, not circular. There was no tail visible to me but the coma was asymmetric in shape, with a tint of green,diffuse at the edges. Nice star field on the edge of Lepus.\nWith the moon fading, the comet brightening, and local conditions almost certainly better for you than Deirdre\u2019s in Ireland, you have a good shot of enjoying an even brighter sight.\nHave a rough idea of what to expect? Well, you\u2019re ready, then.\nOrion is your best friend here, with its unmistakable septuplet of bright stars. The comet will be passing out of the faint winding constellation Eridanus and through Taurus over the next two weeks. On the nights of January 11-13, you can hop from Bellatrix through Orion\u2019s shield and hit the comet easily with binoculars. The following week, it passes that bright, beautiful cluster of antiquity, the Pleiades, and on January 23, as it nears the end of its brightest moment in this passage around the sun, you can aim almost any instrument at the faint star 41 Ari and catch the glowing coma.\nIf you\u2019d like to get a snapshot of the comet from your telescope, you can do so, with practice, using your smartphone, an adapter (there are hundreds of them on eBay), and the NightCap Pro app. Check out the blog iAstrophotography for tips and tricks: you\u2019ll be surprised just how much of the night sky you can capture these days between tweets and texts. For those of you with DSLR cameras and a tripod, the old Waiting for ISON blog has a fantastic, detailed guide for novices on imaging that is a must-read.\nI hope this guide has been thorough but simple enough to use in your quest to see your first (of hopefully many) comets. A green visitor like Lovejoy, visible from nearly anywhere, is a rare and beautiful site. Clear skies to you!\nPhoto \"Comet C/2014 Q2 Lovejoy by Mike Broussard.
