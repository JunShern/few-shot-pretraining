    "text": "Playgroups are important for variety of reasons, but the biggest one out of all the reasons is the role it plays in the development of a child. This prepares the child for school as basics about all the subjects taught in school are taken care of. It is also a place where children get an idea of their creativity and other interests. The importance of playgroup or preschool in a child\u2019s life is many. We shall take a look at some of them.\nPlaygroups focus a lot on the development of a child, they use techniques enhanced specifically for this purpose. At such young age importance and focus should be given to the development of key physical features as well mental health too. Physical activities such as sports and games develop the muscles in the children\u2019s body. At latter stages of preschool motor skills are given special importance; the stage by stage development of key aspects of a child plays a huge implication on the future growth and development of the child. So the importance of the kids\u2019 playgroup cannot be neglected in developing a child to be a better and healthy human being for the future.\nThis is an important character for the success of an individual; team work is required for success in academics as well as work career. To hone these skills at an early age is an advantage for the child\u2019s future. Playgroups focus on team work by making the children work in groups and also making them complete tasks and perform activities in a group. It also helps them build bonds which is an important aspect of growing up. This also builds up respects for one\u2019s fellow human being.\nSince playgroups focus on the development of a child rather than mold them into something specific the curriculum is based on key aspects and characters that a child needs. This makes the learning experience fun and life lessons are learned. Everything is designed to keep the child interested, from furniture to the teaching techniques utilized everything is child centered.\nDiscipline is easy to enforce with strict rules and harsh punishments, but its relatively tough task to make children understand it and develop self discipline. This is where the brilliance of playgroups comes into play; since the environment is so child centered the children develop respect towards teachers and fellow students along with a sense of self control which leads to developing self discipline."
