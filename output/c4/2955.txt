The ninth is wholly unexpected.\nMany happy returns, in the true sense of the greeting \u2013 I hope to be reading your blog for a long time yet.\nHenry, happy birthday. Wishing you good health, wisdom and serenity as you face the next decade. Colin.\nHad Tennyson known you, the line would have read \u201csurely will be done.\u201d Have a great day and a year to match.\nThank you, Beds. Greetings to the United States, too.\nOn this occasion, let me also say that there are scores of judges in North America who join many more in the UK and elsewhere to wish Sir Henry the Blogger a long and happy time to come.\nHow very kind, Jack, and greetings to Alberta, its bears and its Rockies.\nThank you, Ravi. Please remember we want to come and see you performing with your band one day.\nI join with the others and can say that you have already blessed the world with much wisdom and good judgement for which I for one (among many I am sure) am very grateful.\nThank you, Stephanie, and greetings to faraway Queensland.\nThank you, Peter, and greetings to beautiful Britosh Columbia.\nLooking forward to seeing you later this evening."
