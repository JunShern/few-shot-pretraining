    "text": "As a group, vegetarians tend to be leaner than meat-eaters. That could be because some vegetarian diets are rather extreme and eliminate so many higher-fat foods. Many vegetarians are also very health conscious, and they pay particular attention to the amount of food they eat. But there are as many types of vegetarians as there are reasons for following a vegetarian diet, so the rule doesn\u2019t hold true for all.\nVegans, or strict vegetarians, eat only foods from plant sources. Macrobiotic vegetarians are vegans who eat a very limited variety of foods. Lacto-vegetarians include dairy products in their diets while lacto-ovo vegetarians eat dairy products and eggs. Pesco-vegetarians, or pescatarians include seafood in an otherwise vegetarian diet; fruitarians include only raw or dried fruits, seeds and nuts in their diets. Semi-vegetarians or \u201cmostly\u201d vegetarians eat animal foods but not on a regular basis.\nWhile some of these diets are inherently lower in fat and/or calories than others, they aren\u2019t necessarily healthier because they aren\u2019t nutritionally balanced. Since most people can\u2019t stick to any type of overly restrictive diet, vegetarianism is destined to become just one more thing that didn\u2019t \u201cwork\u201d for anyone who tries to use it solely for the purpose of losing weight.\nTo keep this menu as nutritionally balanced as possible, make all substitutes within the same food group, substituting fruit for fruit, grain for grain, veggie for veggie, in equal amounts. And remember to drink lots of water with and between meals.\nYou can access their Web site for free for a weeklong trial, I believe. You could use that time to download some of their vegetarian recipes and start creating your own meal plans.\nI did South Beach many years ago as the catalyst for my weight loss. I wasn't vegetarian then, but I have been for a very long time now, and I still follow SB principles. Understanding the science behind that diet is what's helped me maintain my weight loss and make good choices that fit in with my diet no matter if I'm cooking or at a restaurant or at a party or whatever. That's going to be the biggest takeaway for you: rather than just reading recipes, make sure you understand why they want you to eat the kinds of foods they want you to eat.\nI lost 70+ pounds. i didn't know what i was doing when i started, either. if you are willing to try, accept that it takes time and effort to make lasting changes, and are ok with learning as you go, you'll totally get there.\na lot of people like sparkpeople.com. it is a free support and diet tool website.\nI have maintained my weight for a year now and still do the same things. I think it's possible to still be a foodie and eat in a healthful manner. Moderation really -is- key.\nHas lost 10 lbs in the last two months with just balanced diet and occasional walks (tho some walks/hikes were very long).\nHe tried doing exercise a few months ago, but it just isn't a habit he is willing to develop at this time (mainly because it interrupts the flow of his day and makes it difficult for him to focus on projects). When he has less on his project list, we will try to make exercise a part of his life.\n#1 Garcinia Cambogia (Pure Garcinia Cambogia Extract), Ultra Premium Natural Fruit Extract for Weight Loss & Appetite Suppressant. 65% HCA, 180 Vegetarian Capsules for 1500mg to 3000mg a day. 1300 Formula with Potassium and Calcium Weight Loss Pills.\nJoin Thousands and Lose Weight Fast With Excellent Weight Loss Pills And Receive Our Weight Loss Program FREE Via EMAIL!\nClinically Proven To Strip Belly Fat, Curb Appetite, Reduce Caloric Intake and Burn Fat Fast.
