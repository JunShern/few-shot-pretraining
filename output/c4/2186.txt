    "text": "Faith has kind-of received a bad rap, yet it is probably the most common denominator in humanity. Every person exercises some form of faith every day. We exercise faith in architects, construction workers, and materials every time we walk into any building. We exercise faith in other drivers any time we get on the roads to get from point A to point B. We all exercise faith in something or someone.\nFaith can be defined as the \"belief in, devotion to, or trust in somebody or something.\" We exercise it in science. We have to have faith in the scientist and the process. We exercise it in history through the historian and his/her perspective. It all requires faith on some level.\nWith Christianity, it requires faith in God (the Creator), His Word (the Bible), and His ways (truths and principles). We will take a look at God and the other persons of the Trinity later on in this series. For now, lets take a look at three facts about faith we can learn from Hebrews 11.\nFaith opens our eyes (Heb. 11:1). It gives us confidence to know that God will keep His promises, whether that be eternal life, a better experience of life apart from the stains of sin, peace, joy, prosperity, and health - sometimes in this life but confirmed in the next. It also serves as the convincing proof of God's being at work in the past, the present, and the future!\nFaith propels us forward (Heb. 11:2). This entire chapter of the Bible is a \"Hall of Fame\" of faithful people, and, while they experienced good things, they also experienced some very difficult things. Still, they remained faithful all the way until the end of their lives. They \"died in faith\" (Heb. 11:13). It was their faith that launched them through the difficult times in anticipation of the coming Messiah.\nFaith alone brings God satisfaction (Heb. 11:6). In the end, it is completely impossible to please God apart from saving faith. We can try to do all the good we can do to all the people we can do it to, but apart from faith it means nothing.\nWE MUST HAVE FAITH IN GOD.\nGod is worthy of our faith. He is the author of anything else we might try to put our faith into. When we place our faith in God, He opens our eyes, keeps us going towards the prize, and sets us on a journey of the realization of the truth.\nBelieve in God. God exists. All creation came from Him. Believe in His existence. Don't fall for the \"theories\" or lies that try to reconcile creation without involving the Creator.\nBelieve in His promises. God promises to reward those who follow Him. Some rewards and blessings can be experienced now. Most will be experienced in eternity.\nPoint others to faith in Jesus. Share Jesus with others. Your faith in a God Who sent His only Son Jesus to die for our sins compels you to point others to Him. Anything less than that is absent of faith."
