Learning that others have overcome obstacles far greater than theirs gives them the hope and inspiration to continue.\nMillions of people will admit, when asked, that they struggle to stay motivated. Every newspaper and news broadcast seems to be filled with doom and gloom. The global financial systems are in danger of collapse and there is talk about depression. These are just a few of the reasons why so many people are in need of motivational articles."
