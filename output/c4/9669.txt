    "text": "One of the huge advantages of S.P.H.E.RE. is the size of it. As a point of care device it is very small and portable.\nIn order to use the ELISA technology in this size, only very small amounts of blood and other solutions are required. To get good solutions, the most appropriated method is to use microfluidic chips. Those chips contain antibodies, that capture the HSP70 proteins. For the reactions only a few drops of every solution are needed.\nDue to the very low concentration of the HSP70, it is important to use highliy sensitive electronics.\nTo meassure these proteins, single silicon photomultpliers (SIPMs) are therefore used. The SIPMs determit the counts of photons and therefore the number of proteins, which correlates with the degree of the cancer illness.\nAfter filtering and processing the signal, the result of the measurement is shown on the display of the S.P.H.E.R.E."
