    "text": "Whether you want to put your piano into storage, or you\u2019re moving to a new home, you shouldn\u2019t try to handle the relocation on your own. There are many advantages to hiring a professional moving company that specializes in piano moving. In fact, the following are just a few of the reasons you might find yourself picking up the phone to request piano movers and storage solutions.\nWhile this should go without saying, pianos are heavy and difficult to handle. They come in a variety of styles, so each presents their own challenges. Instead of breaking your back trying to maneuver the awkward weight of your baby grand or upright piano, you should let a team of highly-trained long distance piano movers handle the heavy lifting.\nSince pianos are difficult to lift, you need to make sure that you have all of the necessary tools to relocate them safely and efficiently. You should also use crating, packaging, and other materials to make sure that your piano doesn\u2019t get damaged in transport. Not to mention, you need to rent a truck large enough to hold your piano. When you hire professionals, you can save yourself a lot of time, money, and the hassle of collecting all of the necessary resources.\nIf you live in an apartment building or have a narrow hall in your home, you don\u2019t want to attempt to maneuver your piano on your own. Professional piano movers have plenty of experience with navigating difficult paths, so they are able to get the job done more efficiently. Best of all, you don\u2019t have to worry about them scuffing your floors or chipping the paint on your walls.\nWhen you are completing a household move of any distance, you have a million other things to plan. From your travel plans to school enrollments, there are plenty of other things that you can focus on when you let experienced piano movers handle your relocation needs. To save yourself extra stress, you should hire a full-service moving company to take care of as much of your logistics as possible.\nWhether your piano is a priceless family heirloom or an expensive piece of art for your home, you shouldn\u2019t have to worry about it getting damaged in transport. If you don\u2019t have a lot of experience with handling your delicate instrument, you are far better off leaving your piano relocation in the hands of professional movers.\nAfter learning more about why you should hire expert piano movers, you should get in touch with Crown Moving & Storage. You can request a consultation with one of our move coordinators to discuss the most efficient method for safely transporting your piano, or you can fill out our online form to request your free, no-obligation estimate."
