    "text": "Two USAID-funded projects in Bangladesh are training gher farmers on good management practices to sustainably boost the productivity and profitability of their farms.\nThe vast floodplains of southern Bangladesh have been transformed over centuries into a patchwork of rice fields and aquaculture ponds.\nTo increase the food production from this challenging landscape, farmers have developed a unique agricultural system called a gher. A pond is dug into the rice field, and the excavated mud is piled up around the banks to create both a footpath to navigate the expansive grid and cultivable land for growing vegetables.\nWhile this method of cultivation has been used for generations, WorldFish\u2019s adaptive research on improved gher farming technologies has increased the productivity of these systems by 30%.\nIn Bagerhat District, the Aquaculture for Income and Nutrition (AIN) project has provided training on good management practices for shrimp, fish and vegetable gher farming to 19,479 farmers since 2012, 28% of whom are women.\nThe practical sessions cover the whole aquaculture process, including pond preparation, polyculture technologies for fish and shrimp, the correct stocking densities, feeding regimes, harvest techniques, vegetable cultivation, nutrition, and more.\nAIN also focuses on educating farmers on the importance of sourcing and using good-quality polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-tested shrimp postlarvae that are free of white spot syndrome virus to reduce disease outbreak, along with connecting farmers with postlarvae suppliers.\n\u201cEarlier, my harvest was not good because I did not have the required knowledge about how to release the fry, feed them or use fertilizers,\u201d recalls mother of two Sabita Odhikari, who has been brackish-water gher farming for 26 years in her village of Rai, Bagerhat.\n\u201cNow when I prepare the gher, I dry it, then apply lime, fill it up with water, add bleach, and only then release the fry. Earlier I wouldn\u2019t do all this,\u201d she adds.\nThe training sessions also teach participants how to culture vegetable crops around the banks of the gher, as well as the best varieties to plant during each season.\n\u201cAfter the training, I would share the knowledge with my husband or son, and they would all listen to me \u2026 My fish and shrimp harvest is better, my family life has improved, and my children are happy,\u201d she says.\nIn neighboring District, the Cereal Systems Initiative for South Asia Bangladesh (CSISA-BD) has also provided training on good management practices for freshwater and brackish-water gher farming to 5800 farmers since 2011.\nThe project is also conducting research in partnership with local farmers to identify the most effective and affordable fish feed for local growing conditions.\n\u201cMy neighbors and I told our trainers that we have learned about fish farming, but if we could do something about the feed we could all benefit. We were using costly feed, but of low quality ... The trainers suggested we start doing research, and that is how I got involved,\u201d says Mahammad Harun Mollah, a freshwater fish and prawn gher farmer from Dhopakhola village, Khulna.\n\u201cWe used four different types of feed for research last year, but one stood out. This year we are using the top two local feeds along with last year\u2019s pick, and researching these to find the best one. The improved feed was a big advantage. Now the fish grow twice as much with less disease, so the production is higher,\u201d explains Harun, who expects his yields and profit to further increase as the research continues.\nIn a country where more than 46 million people in rural areas are living in poverty, these projects are helping to provide increased incomes for around 680,000 small- and medium-scale farmers and their families.\n\u201cThe success with gher farming has improved my income. Life has become so much better. I\u2019ve gotten two more ghers, built a house and this year I got married! Life's good,\u201d smiles Harun."
