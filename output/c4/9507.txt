Thanks for racing with us. You\u2019re a great group of people.\nAlso thanks to all of our sponsors, especially Todd & Brad Reed Photography and Cherry Republic (for hosting a challenge), great volunteers, Leelanau School and other vendors. Support our sponsors and let them know that you appreciate their support of our race."
