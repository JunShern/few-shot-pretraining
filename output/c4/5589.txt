    "text": "I have been following the debate regarding your decision to post a letter claiming that vaccines are harmful and read your editorial statement in response to that debate. You stated that you support the right of everyone to share their opinions and made a grand \u201cfree speech for all\u201d declaration, however, I think you are confusing the validity of sharing opinions with making false statements.\nFor example, there has been lots of debate about the expansion of bike lanes in downtown Victoria \u2013 there are both pros and cons to this issue and valid points on both sides and therefore, there are various opinions. However, other topics, such as the \u201cflat earth\u201d conspiracy are clearly in violation of every single scientific fact. Would you feel comfortable printing two articles \u2013 one supporting the round earth belief and one supporting the flat earth belief \u2013 with equal footing? No \u2013 because that isn\u2019t responsible reporting.\nThis is exactly how the Trump presidency has twisted the truth. Even though every single metric proved that there were more people at Obama\u2019s inauguration, their team claimed that it was \u201ctheir opinion\u201d that more people came to see Trump. That isn\u2019t an opinion \u2013 it\u2019s a lie, and when you promote the kind of lies expressed by the anti-vaxxer you published, you aren\u2019t just promoting a lie, you are threatening people\u2019s lives."
