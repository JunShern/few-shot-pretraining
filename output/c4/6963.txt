    "text": "Having just finished a seven-week series of messages on prayer this past Sunday evening, one might think I had shared every illustration I knew of on the subject. Alas, there is more.\nI thought I would add one more ditty on the subject in my post for today. My copy came to me from a dear friend and church member.\n\"The proper way for a man to pray,\"\nIs down upon his knees.\"\n\"No, I should say the way to pray,\"\nAnd rapt and upturned eyes.\"\n\"Such posture is too proud.\nWith both thumbs pointing toward the ground,\"\nAnd my head a-pointin' down.\"\nA wonderful story is often told about an incident in the life of Poland's famous concert pianist, Ignace Paderewski.\nA mother took her small child to a concert by Paderewski to expose him to the talent of the great pianist. She hoped as she did to encourage her son in his piano lessons, which he had just begun.\nThey arrived early at the concert and were seated near the front. Standing alone on the stage was a marvelous Steinway grand piano. As they waited for the concert to begin, the mother entered into a conversation with the people beside her.\nEventually, eight o'clock came, and the lights began to dim. Everyone turned their attention to the stage and the grand piano. The mother looked up and was suddenly horrified. Her son was sitting at the piano and banging out with one little finger, \"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.\" \"Oh no,\" she thought, \"How am I going to get him down?\"\nAs she began to make her way to the platform, Ignace Paderewski himself appeared on stage. He went over and sat down beside the child. He whispered in the child's ear, \"Don't quit; keep playing!\" As the little boy continued to play, Paderewski reached down with his left hand and began to fill in the bass part.\nThen with his right arm around the little boy, he added a running obbligato. Together, the old master and the young novice held the crowd mesmerized.\nAs God\u2019s children, many times we Christians are tempted to feel like we are spending our lives pecking out meaningless and inconsequential little tunes, thinking as we do that our gifts are just too small for God to use in any significant way. And yet, that is all He desires of us: our willingness to use whatever talent(s) we have been given.\nWhenever we attempt something in His name, He comes along beside us, sits down next to us, and whispers in our ear, \"Don't quit; keep playing.\" Then, with His subtle guidance and able assistance, we suddenly find ourselves making beautiful music both with and for God, and enriching the lives of ourselves and of others as we glorify Him.\nNote: This story, in all of its various versions, has long been a staple among speakers and writers, especially preachers. Accordingly, it is posted all over the internet. That there was a famed concert pianist named Paderewski is certainly true. He would later become the Prime Minister of Poland. This particular incident, however, may or may not have actually occurred in his life.\nTo my knowledge, its authenticity is not confirmed. Thus, it is perhaps best to attribute it to folklore. If so, the probable origins can be found at: http://www.truthorfiction.com/rumors/p/paderewski.htm.\nWhether the story itself is true or not, the point made by the story is nonetheless readily apparent.\n\"YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO!\"\nIn Issue #7 of the publication, Crossroads (p. 16), the following story is recounted.\n\u201cI\u2019ve looked through the rule book,\u201d he said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to go.\u201d Wow! What about that!\nWith all the discussion these days about the concept of Hell (i.e., http://www.albertmohler.com/2011/03/08/doing-away-with-hell-part-one/), the greatest truth to remember about Hell is that no one really has to go to that awful place. We do have a choice.\nWe can heed the Word of God, repent of our sins, receive the offer of God\u2019s grace, and be gloriously saved. As Paul says in Romans 8:1: \u201cTherefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.\u201d The key to no condemnation from God is to be found, of course, in Christ Jesus.\nFor, as John says (I John 5:12)\u2026 \u201cHe who has the Son has life\u2026\u201d; but \u201che who does not have the Son of God does not have life.\u201d I trust you have found Christ. If so, you have the assurance of life \u2013 life abundant and life eternal one day in a wonderful place called Heaven.\nto all of us eventually.\nIn any event (and in light of the response to my last post), here is another little jewel for the over 55 crowd. It too is very well put.\nA self-absorbed college freshman was walking along the beach in southern California one day. As he did, he stopped next to a senior adult man who was contentedly resting on some nearby steps.\nIn short order, he took it upon himself to explain to this out of touch senior citizen why it was impossible for the older generation to understand his generation.\n\"You see, old man, you grew up in a different world, actually an almost primitive one compared to the world of today.\" The student said this loud enough for any and everyone around to hear.\nHe continued. \"The young people of today grew up with television, jet planes, space travel, and men walking on the moon. We have nuclear energy, wireless telecommunication, and computers with fiber optic internet connections that allow us to communicate at the speed of light all over the world, and many more such wonderful things today...\"\nAfter a brief silence, the old man responded as follows. \"You're absolutely right, son. We didn't have any of those things when we were young... So, we invented them all! Now, you arrogant little snot, what are you doing for the next generation?\nNeedless to say, the applause from up and down the beach was amazing!\nA little silver-haired lady called her neighbor and said, \"Please come over here and help me. I have a killer new jigsaw puzzle; and I just can't figure out how to get started.\"\nHer neighbor asked, \"What is it supposed to be when it is finished?\"\nThe little silver-haired lady said, \"According to the picture on the box, it is supposed to be a rooster.\"\nHer neighbor decided to go over and help her with the puzzle after all. The little old lady let her in and showed her where she had the puzzle spread all over the table.\nHer neighbor studied the pieces for a moment or two; and then looked at the box. Finally, she turned to the little old lady, and said, \"First of all, no matter what we do, we are just not going to be able to assemble these pieces into anything resembling a rooster.\"\nShe then took the little old lady by the hand and said, \"Secondly, I want you to relax. Let's have a nice cup of tea, and then\u2026\" she said with a deep sigh, \"Let's put all the Corn Flakes back in the box.\"\nLike many people, I have become unduly dependent upon my \u201csmart phone\u201d. Among its many uses, it is my alarm clock. Which is perfectly fine\u2026 except whenever time change roles around.\nThen, I am forever searching the internet to make certain that my phone will automatically adjust its time clock to or from Daylight Savings Time. I live in fear that it will not make the change; and that I, the Pastor, will be late to church as a result.\nIn any event, my recent twice-a-year quandary led me to an e-mail I had received from a friend some time back. It is fairly thought provoking; and I thought I would post it on my blog on this, the eve of time change Sunday.\nIt is titled \u201cThe Bible or the Cell Phone\u201d.\nWhat if we gave it to our kids as a gift?\nOh, and no dropped calls!\nOne more thing\u2026 Unlike our cell phone, we don't have to worry about our Bible being disconnected; because Jesus has already paid the bill.\nErnest Hemingway once wrote a short story called \"The Capital of the World.\" In it, he told the story of a father and his teenage son who were estranged from one another. The son\u2019s name was Paco. He had wronged his father. As a result, in his shame, he had run away from home.\nIn the story, the father searched all over Spain for Paco, but still he could not find the boy. Finally, in the city of Madrid, in a last desperate attempt to find his son, the father placed an ad in the daily newspaper. The ad read: \"PACO, MEET ME AT THE HOTEL MONTANA. NOON TUESDAY. ALL IS FORGIVEN. PAPA.\"\nThe father in Hemingway's story prayed that the boy would see the ad; and then maybe, just maybe, he would come to the Hotel Montana. On Tuesday, at noon, the father arrived at the hotel. When he did, he could not believe his eyes.\nAn entire squadron of police officers had been called out in an attempt to keep order among eight hundred young boys. It turned out that each one of them was named Paco. And each one of them had come to meet his respective father and find forgiveness in front of the Hotel Montana.\nEight hundred boys named Paco had read the ad in the newspaper and had hoped it was for them. Eight hundred Pacos had come to receive the forgiveness they so desperately desired.\nThis beautiful story illustrates the great truth that Jesus was driving at in His famed Parable of the Prodigal Son. Just as there are many, many Pacos in Hemingway\u2019s story, so there are innumerable prodigals in the world.\nFortunately, God has not given up on us. Persistently and indefatigably, He searches for us. He never gives up on us. He longs day and night for us to come home. And if and when we do, He is overjoyed. He loves us. He forgives us. He restores us. He f\u00eates us.\nI hope you have come home to the Father. I hope you know the peace and joy that comes with having been forgiven by God. If not, my friend, the Father\u2019s invitation to come home still stands. Even now, He is waiting for you.\nIn his book, The Tale of the Tardy Oxcart (Nashville: Word Publishing, 1998, p.2), famed author Charles R. Swindoll tells the following story.\nA professor in a college ethics class presented his students with a problem. He said, \"A man has syphilis and his wife has tuberculosis. They have had four children: one has died; the other three have what is considered to be a terminal illness.\nThe mother is pregnant. What do you recommend?\" After a spirited discussion, the majority of the class voted that she should abort the child. \"Fine,\" said the professor. \"You've just killed Beethoven.\"\nThe British playwright Enid Bagnold once asked a feminist what advice she would give to a twenty-three-year-old housewife who, having lost four children, found herself pregnant again by an abusive, alcoholic husband. \"I would urge her to terminate the pregnancy,\" the feminist replied. \"Then,\" said Ms. Bagnold, \"you would have aborted Beethoven.\"\nFor my part, I love music \u2013 a wide variety of types. I am even beginning to enjoy classical a little. However, I know this much: whether my tastes in music include classical or not, the world would be a much sadder place without the works of Ludwig Van Beethoven. I am glad his mother chose not to abort him. I am glad he was given a chance to live, and thereby, a chance to make a difference in this world.\nThis evening, a crowd of several hundred people has gathered at the First Baptist Church in Lenoir City to pledge their support to the HOPE Resource Center: a crisis pregnancy ministry located here in our community.\n79 of these clients made a decision to receive Christ!\n193 of these clients chose life instead!\n101 of these committed to abstinence after meeting with client advocates.\nAll of this is made possible by generous support from the body of Christ at large. This includes my wife and me. If you would like to know more about how you can make a difference in the future of some unborn child, and of the world that he or she might one-day impact, feel free to contact HOPE.\nYou will find them at: http://www.hoperesourcecenterknoxville.com/. Who knows, the life you save might be that of the world\u2019s next great composer?!"
