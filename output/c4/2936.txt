Just when I had started feeling safe and smug having outsmarted acne (at age 30) it hit me..n hit me hard.\nJust when one pimple (yikeesss hate the word) would start fading a pair of twins would pop up and then another one and on and on..\nI tried working on my diet, putting all kind of funny smelling and sounding things on my face, I prayed every night for them to disappear by morning and I jumped out of bed every morning hoping that my prayers had been answered. When nothing worked I decided to give those too good to be true Proactive infomercials a go.\nI ordered it and started off on the Proactive way of life that\u2019s supposed to be life changing and all\u2026well if its life changing for Celina Jaitley it can sure be for me ..right?\nI did not see to much change initially, but then I received a call from Proactive about the correct way of using the Proactive system, once I implemented those instructions \u2013 slowly but surely I started to see change..Lo and behold the acne started to clear..yay!!\nStep 1 : Take shirt button size cleanser in palm and work into wet skin. Wash off.\nStep 2 : Take a cotton pad, add 2 drops of water and about 3-4 drops of toner, wipe skin with it. Allow the toner to air dry.\nStep 3 : Take half shirt button size moisturizer and apply on skin.\nUse two times a day, once in the morning after a bath and once at night before bed.\nDo this consistently and you are sure to see results.\nThere are plenty of acne systems in the market and some are supposed to be even better than Proactive, however these are not really available in India yet.\nOk now lets get to the celebrations!!\nStep 2 : Leave a comment below this video, telling me that you have subscribed and wish to win.\nOpen to Indian residents only and open till Feb 4th 2014.\nDo request your friends and family to join the party too and thank you so much for your love and support.\nI have subscibed.. wish to win this for my mother..\nI have subscribed and would wish to win it for myself. I have been suffering from bad acne for quite sometime now and would really like to have clear and healthy skin. Sounds like a great product."
