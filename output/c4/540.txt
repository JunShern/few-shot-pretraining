But its hard to explain why, and it might not be even Windows 10\u2019s fault.\nOn-screen keyboard doesn\u2019t pop up automatically for Firefox, but does for Edge (Surface Pro 3 in tablet mode). One assumes because Edge is an Universal App?\nTraditional Chinese keyboard doesn\u2019t display candidate list automatically; you have to press down-arrow every time to see the complete list. That is 1/4 to 1/3 more keystrokes per Chinese character!\nPressing the touchscreen for any action (e.g. close windows, \u2018Ok\u2019 button etc) has a minute but discernible lag, especially if you are used to an iPad. Two finger touchscreen scrolling is great though. Does this lie with Win10 or Surface Pro 3?\nOr maybe I\u2019m just a grumpy old man set in my ways. I will seriously mourn the day Microsoft stops supporting Windows 7.\nIts finally finished. Windows Update has been calculating which updates to apply since 9am. So that\u2019s more than 6 hours to calculate \u2013 now comes the actual update part.\nFair enough, this is a fresh reinstall of Windows 7 on a relic of a CPU: AMD Athlon x2. But its desktop class and not RAM constrained.\nI reckon Windows Update should be the real-world metric to assess how fast a system is. Sure, this way of measuring has a big flaw, since new updates are constantly available so updating at different times will produce different results. Regardless, it\u2019ll still be a good-enough rough measure of how a system would perform for the average person using the PC in real life."
