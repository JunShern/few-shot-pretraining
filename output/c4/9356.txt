    "text": "A Chapin High School senior who is Harvard University-bound and received a nearly perfect SAT score is on the shortlist to become one of the few students named 2018 Military Child of the Year by a nonprofit working with military families.\nOperation Homefront announced earlier this month that Chapin\u2019s Bryce Kim is one of 15 students nationwide to compete to represent the U.S. Army in the national scholarship contest. A total of 95 semifinalists were announced for all six branches of the Armed Forces.\n\u201cEl Paso doesn\u2019t always have a semifinalist every year and so it\u2019s an honor just to bring this kind of recognition to our school and Chapin,\u201d Kim said.\nThe Military Child of the Year is awarded to six students representing each branch of the Armed Forces \u2013 Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard and National Guard. The honor is awarded to students based on their volunteerism, leadership, extracurricular involvement and other criteria while facing the challenges of military family life.\n\u201cThis is my 11th school now and the fact that I was able to transition smoothly and succeed academically as well as be involved in athletics and community service really helped,\u201d Kim said.\nThe Chapin Husky, who competes in cross country and track, also is a Student Ambassador and member of the National Honor Society.\nChurchill wrote a letter of recommendation on Kim\u2019s behalf for the application process. Her letter stressed how he embodies the army\u2019s core values of loyalty, duty, respect, selfless service, honor and integrity and personal courage which makes him an ideal candidate to represent the Army as the Military Child of the Year.\nThe award recipients will travel to Washington, D.C. to be recognized at an April 19 gala, during which senior leaders of each branch of service will present the awards. The winners will receive a $10,000 scholarship, a laptop and other gifts. Kim is the only finalist in the El Paso area and among three in Texas competing to represent the Army."
