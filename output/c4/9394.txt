    "text": "Today, we\u2019re going to be diving into the five stages of the consumer decision-making process. A lot has changed. How consumers go about it is completely different, but the five stages are surprisingly exactly the same. Let\u2019s dive into what this new world looks like.\nStage 1: You have a problem or a need.\nStage 2: They want to do an information search. It used to be ask a friend, ask a colleague, look at the newspaper \u2014 but that\u2019s a little different now.\nNow, the reality is, that in this need phase, you have a lot of ways to influence how people are deciding what they need. One of those is field marketing, another is your sales team, but an often not-so-used way of helping people understand their need is actually through SEO and paid search.\nMaybe you are a time-tracking software. People are searching: \u201cHow to manage my employees\u2019 time\u201d Well, if you\u2019re Toggl \u2014 or one of the other many apps out there to manage people\u2019s times \u2014 it\u2019s critical that you have the right content for the different stages of people when they\u2019re discovering what options exist to solve their problem or need.\nAn awesome tool that you can use for this is actually called AnswerThePublic. If you\u2019re looking to understand what product or service is out there and what the need is, type in your primary keyword \u2014 for example, type in, \u201cSEO,\u201d or, \u201cPPC,\u201d for us \u2014 or for you, maybe it\u2019s \u201ccloud security.\u201d Then see what are people searching for when using that keyword. You might see topics like, \u201cThe benefits of cloud security\u201d or \u201cAm I hacked?\u201d These are all the needs and problems people have. You need content at this stage of the funnel.\nFor our B2B SaaS clients, this is where the majority of their opportunities, deals, and revenue comes from \u2014 at this information stage. This is the bottom of the funnel. People now know that they have a cloud security issue, now they\u2019re looking for top cloud security vendors, top cloud security companies, services, strategies, etc. Here\u2019s where your own website probably won\u2019t rank. In fact, at Stage 3, it probably won\u2019t rank either. You\u2019re going to have a hard time generating these leads through yourself.\nHistorically, people would gather information through friends, through television, through the radio, through the newspaper, and now it\u2019s changed, right? They\u2019re going primarily to search engines \u2014 areas where they can control the entire experience themselves. The reality is, that you need to make sure that your brand shows up not only as your own website, as one of those 10 possible results, or one of those 4 ads, but that you\u2019re also prevalent in the marketplaces.\nThis goes back to the Yelp and the Amazon effect. B2B customers are now just the same as B2C customers, in the sense that they don\u2019t want you to tell them why you\u2019re so great, but instead, they want to look at other people saying that you\u2019re great. This is why Gardner has a full business model. This is why Forrester has a full business model. It\u2019s because these are \u201cindependent,\u201d \u2014 now I say that with quotes \u2014 research companies that are giving information to targeted consumers who are looking to buy. You need to be a part of that journey.\nStage 3 is the alternatives \u2014 it blends right into Stage 2.\nHistorically, as the marketer, you got to control what people thought about your product. Now, other people control what is being said about your product and you need to make sure that when they\u2019re evaluating alternatives they don\u2019t forget about you.\nNow most of the time, I see people address Stage 3 through what I call competitor AdWords campaigns. This is where you launch ads on your competitors\u2019 brand terms so you can show up and say, \u201cHey, guys. You want to try Zenefits, but you really should know about Gusto.\u201d Now the problem is, is in the last four-and-a-half years, we\u2019ve never seen one of these campaigns perform profitably. So instead of simply trying to take people who have already decided they want Zenefits and try Gusto, you need to go back into that informational search. That\u2019s where Software Advice, Capterra, G2 Crowd \u2014 for us, it\u2019s Clutch.co, for your own industry it could be anything.\nUsually, you can find these directories and these review sites for your space by doing very simple queries. Take your primary keyword and before that search, \u201cTop\u201d or \u201cBest\u201d or take your primary keyword and after it put, \u201cReviews\u201d or \u201cAlternatives\u201d or \u201cCompetitors.\u201d And now, start to see the ecosystem from which your brand, product, and services exist within and make sure that every conversation, you\u2019re a part of.\nIn this day and age, Stage 4, the purchasing decision, is such an undervalued part of marketing. I constantly see sales reps going into pitches with poorly designed decks, no real case studies that are designed properly, nothing\u2019s in the proper medium, and everything\u2019s from 10 years ago or 5 years ago. Everybody\u2019s so worried about lead gen that they forgot that you can generate a million leads, close none of them, and nothing matters.\nWhat\u2019s so critical at Stage 4 is that you can lower your cost per opportunity drastically here by affecting your close rate. See, when you look through an entire funnel, there\u2019s so much money that\u2019s being spent in generating the lead that activating the lead and closing the deal is such an after-thought in marketing that it\u2019s not being funded properly.\nOne of the biggest wins you can do today is to ask yourself, \u201cIf I was talking to two other vendors, does my sales team have the best assets compared to those other two competitors?\u201d If not, maybe it\u2019s time for you to invest more into the stage of closing the deal than trying to get more. In other words, what\u2019s the point of throwing all this water into a bucket if there are all the holes at the bottom? Focus on the bottom of the bucket just as much as getting water into it.\nThe reality is, is not every customer will love you and those ones that don\u2019t are some of your greatest learning opportunities. Try using a simple NPS software, like AskNicely \u2014 which we\u2019ve leveraged here. There are also simple things like quarterly check-ins and monthly check-ins. Here, we do weekly updates. The tighter you can get your feedback loop from customer success or customer failure and then learn from that, the faster you can improve your deliverable, your product, or your service.\nThe reality is, the thing people pay you for has a huge part to do with how you\u2019re marketing yourself. In other words, if you looked at what Seth Godin preaches, the \u201cpurple cow\u201d approach: \u201cIs your marketing just more noise in a noisy environment or is what you\u2019re marketing doing the marketing itself for you?\u201d A perfect example would be Tesla. They can take almost zero corporate advertising budget and still grow at a rapid rate because their product is a purple cow.\nSo start to ask yourself, \u201cWhat types of features, sets, or innovations can my service or product pertain to or contain so that marketing it is a natural growth of what happens after someone purchases it?\u201d They can\u2019t help but tell their friend, not one friend, but multiple friends. That post-purchase is going to be critical for you as you go towards hyper growth.\nThank you so much for watching this video.
