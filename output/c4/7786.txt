    "text": "With the wonderful weather I\u2019ve been focusing on getting my life back on track but rather than making big radical changes what I\u2019ve been focused on is making small incremental improvements then once I start getting into a good habit (normally within a week of doing something) I then add another thing that I can do. For example, I\u2019ve said to myself that each night I will go for a walk \u2013 doesn\u2019t have to be a big walk but at least one walk a night as a way of unwinding from work and working out any stress which can help to get to sleep without having my mind racing at 100 kilometres per hour. I\u2019m going to keep doing that and then make another life style change when I feel comfortable. Long term what I am hoping that a gradual approach will eventually make these life style changes second nature to the point that I don\u2019t have to consciously think about doing them because they\u2019ll just become part of my normal routine.\nI\u2019m looking forward to also the CD\u2019s arriving that I ordered \u2013 I\u2019ve finally started taking advantage of the YouShop address in the UK where I\u2019ll get the CD\u2019s I ordered repackaged into a single package and then sent to New Zealand. It works out cheaper in most cases because many sellers will give free domestic shipping to the remailer (YouShop) and then I group all those CD\u2019s into a single parcel for a once off cost that is cheaper than if all the individual CD\u2019s were sent via international post as separate parcels. I\u2019ve got around 33 CD\u2019s sitting in my wish list that I\u2019m gradually working through so I\u2019m looking forward to getting that all sorted but in the mean time what I\u2019m going to do if I have some spare time is to start uploading all my music to OneDrive or maybe look at a network attached storage device which has built in redundancy and can be shared over the network such as a Drobo with the device in the spare room along with the router etc.\nAnyway, off to bed now as I\u2019ve got work tomorrow as well as Saturday and Sunday with Monday and Tuesday off as usual."
