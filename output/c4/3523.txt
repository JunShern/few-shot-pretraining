    "text": "On the 15 of April, The Summer Set are set to release their highly anticipated 4th album Legendary. Legendary will mark the band\u2019s first full length release with new label Fearless Records. The album has already been tipped as one of the Most Anticipated Albums of 2013 by renowned music magazine Alternative Press.\nMany fans of the band already know how \u2018Legendary\u2019 relates to the bands project, Half Moon Kids, which encourages fans to \u201cBe Brave, Be Curious, & Be Legendary.\u201d The mention of these Half Moon Kids, and the message of \u2018being the best version of yourself as you can be\u2019 heavily features on the album. Well, that is amongst the crafty references of popular figures such as Audrey Hepburn, James Dean, Jay Z, Beyonce, and TV shows such as How I Met Your Mother! In our opinion, by calling the album Legendary, it\u2019s provided a pressure that\u2019s pushed the band to produce their best album to date. Whether it will be Legendary or not is anyone\u2019s guess.\nThe album itself has been cleverly constructed to keep you in a welcomed state of musical euphoria. As soon as you hit play, you\u2019re instantly confronted with the upbeat and catchy melodies of Maybe Tonight, Boomerang and Jukebox.\nAs the record goes on, in comes the gradual introduction of slightly slower, more acoustic sounding tracks. 7 days being one of them. Although that little bit slower, these tracks still contain that catchy factor courtesy of the use of group vocals! At points, these vocals create the illusion that you\u2019ve stepped into the animated world of The Lion King, especially during the chants that dominate the bridge section of Rescue. But who doesn\u2019t like The Lion King?"
