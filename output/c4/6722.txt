    "text": "Ok, not necessarily in a drinking cup as you would think. My original recipe is actually that for a cake. But my hubby requested that I do cupcakes instead, as he wants to take some to work \u2013 to share with his co-workers. And since cupcakes are easier to eat (no forks, plates needed), then it seems that this is the best way to go.\nCarrot cake is my hubby\u2019s absolute favorite. And he\u2019s always like a kid when he know\u2019s I\u2019m going to make one \u2014 because he\u2019s truly the one who enjoys it the most. He eats it as is, or with vanilla ice cream on the side\u2026Yum!\n2. Mix together flour, cinnamon,baking powder and salt.\n3. Beat together butter and sugar at medium speed until light and fluffy. Add eggs, 1 at a time beating well after each addition. At low speed, alternately beat flour mixture and milk into butter mixture. Stir in carrots and nuts. Pour batter into prepared pan.\n4. Bake cake until top springs back when lightly touched and a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, 40 minutes. Transfer pan to wire rack to cool for 10 minutes. Turn cake out onto rack to cool completely.\n5. To prepare icing, beat together butter and cream cheese at medium speed until completely smooth. Beat in vanilla. Beat in confectioner\u2019 sugar until well blended.\n6. To prepare topping, mix together nuts and brown sugar.\n7. Place cake on a serving plate. Spread icing over top and sides. Sprinkle with nut mixture.\n*** NOTE: This time, I opted not to put a topping, but instead, mixed the finely ground walnuts in the frosting. I added 1-2 tbsp of milk to the frosting mixture as the addition of nuts have made the frosting thicker. Also, if you prefer, the icing can be omitted. Instead, dust top of cake with confectioner\u2019s sugar and serve."
