That said, your haul will be better if you take the trip at eight or nine in the morning. If your group is a minimum of 12 people, you can take out two boats and see which group gets the biggest catch!\nThe boats leave from Marina Port Forum but if you would like to know details of other locations, get in touch and we can find the place that\u2019s best for you.\nWe take care of insurance, licenses, bait, tackle and fuel and mooring costs, which are all included in the price."
