    "text": "You know where you should be on June 18, 2011: in Elmira, Ontario, for a great time for a great cause and the chance to win big prizes. The Ride for Progeria: read on and see what you are in for.\nProgeria, a fatal rapid aging disease that affects children is not a popular one to be heard of, and is the entire reason for the 3rd Annual Ride for Progeria & Benefit Concert. Organizer and motorcycle enthusiast who has won a number of awards this year for her customized Ninja (I.D. Streetfighters, a major sponsor of this ride), Amanda Lynn is ecstatic at the already registered turn out, which surpasses the past years due to weather conditions.\nLast year the ride raised close to $3000.00 for The Progeria Research Foundation (PRF), Progeria Research , and a lot of awareness due to the media exposure and the efforts of the riders. Sponsors such as Daytime TV, 105.3 KOOL FM, 95.5 Kincardine, Kincardine News and the Elmira Independent helped spread the news and this year we have 107.5 DAVE FM, 91.5 the beat and Belt Drive Betty joining the media team.\nThe Progeria Research Foundation was established in 1999 by the parents of a child with Progeria, to fill the intense need for a medical resource for the doctors, patients, and families of those with Progeria, and for funding of Progeria research. Today, PRF is the only non-profit organization in the world that is solely dedicated to finding treatments and the cure for Progeria. PRF has progressed from creation to treatment trials at a phenomenal pace, and it is heroes like Amanda Lynn that make such extraordinary strides possible.\nAmanda Lynn is PRF\u2019s current featured volunteer, and was named a PRF Miracle Maker in 2008 and the following years for her continuing support and exposure of Progeria on her website Fytness Fanatik and through this motorcycle event.\nRegistration is already up and she anticipates a great turn out this year which is set up for June 18, 2011 at Noon.\nThe participants are asked to gather in the Elmira Tim Hortons parking lot beginning at 11am with the ride departing at 1pm.\nThe route will take us north through Wellington and Grey County areas with stops along the way for refreshments. The destination is back in Elmira at the Central Tavern where riders will participate in a Show & Shine judged by radio personalities Dave Jutzi and Brian West of 107.5 Dave FM and 91.5 the beat. Settling in for door prizes and the grand prizes for most pledges collected the riders will then have an opportunity to take in a night of live entertainment featuring West Memphis Suicide and The Creekwater Junkies.\nThe event is supported by a long list of local and motorcycle businesses. Gold Sponsor, Niargara Falls Hilton Hotel has offered a grand prize of a one night stay in their luxurious hotel overlooking the falls, and the G.R.I.P Girls have donated a Blackberry Bold for 2nd prize. There are many other door prizes for the riders that have received pledges, from our various sponsors.\nRegistration for the ride is $25.00 per rider or $35.00 with passenger. This registration includes the concert ticket option and goody bag with completion certificate. Online registration for the Ride for Progeria, presented by Fytness Fanatik, I.D. Streetfighters and FXR Racing is available at Fytness Fanatik come on out for a BUGS-IN-YOUR-TEETH kinda ride!"
