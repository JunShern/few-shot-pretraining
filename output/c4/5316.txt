We are pleased that you were able to dine in the Sierra Mar Restaurant and take in the views while enjoying your meal. We appreciate your recognition of our team and we hope that you will be back soon for another Post Ranch Inn experience. All the Best!\nMerci beaucoup de rester avec nous ici au Post Ranch Inn. Nous sommes tres heureux d'avoir apprecie l'installation, le service et l'experience Post Ranch. Nous nous rejouissons de votre voyage dans un proche avenir. Thank you very much for staying with us here at Post Ranch Inn. We are so happy that you enjoyed the property, the service and the Post Ranch Experience. We look forward to seeing you again in the near future to enjoy the natural setting, wildlife and casual elegance that our guests have come to love so much.\ncecigirl, Merci pour la revue aimable. Nous sommes impatients de vous accueillir et de vous servir \u00e0 nouveau.\nwhat is the price for one night ?\nCould you give us a minimum and a maximum, dates are 16/19 Th October, 3 nights, 5 adults and 2 children, 7 and 5 years' old?\nWe are looking at staying in the upper level mountain house rooms. I wasn't able to find any photos posted from anyone from here, which makes me nervous. Is it worth staying here is we can't splurge for the ocean views?\nThis was the first time we stayed at Post Ranch Inn and only stay in the nicest hotels possible. I can only speak for the rooms with an ocean view. We did hear some people talking about the other views and how spectacular they were. As far as the bathroom,I\u2019m not sure what you mean. The Post Ranch Inn is not a regular hotel... we had our own lodge the first few nights and the last night we were in a 2 story complex. We didn\u2019t hear anything from the people below us. The bathroom while open at the top was not a big deal at all as it is removed from the bedroom. Hope this has helped.\nWe are considering driving from Santa Barbara to Post Ranch Inn - for anyone who has done this drive, how long should we plan for (on a Sunday, taking scenic route) maybe 1 or 2 short stops but that is it . Google maps says about 4hrs. Any info greatly appreciated.\nI agree with the 6 hour suggestion as there are so many places along the way to stop and soak up the beautiful sights! Enjoy one of the most beautiful drives on earth!\nDear past guests, Is the stay really worth the cost? We love beautiful hotels & great service but for 3k US dollars for a suite with view - in June - one night - I really wonder if this hotel is worth the splurge??\n\"Difficile de juger toutes les chambres, mais la n\u00f4tre (Upper Coast Full Ocean View) \u00e9tait vraiment magnifique !\"\n\"Vue sur l'oc\u00e9an bien entendu... l'Ocean House par exemple\"\n\"Prenez celles sur la falaise, vous ne serez pas g\u00ean\u00e9 par la v\u00e9g\u00e9tation pour la vue somptueuse sur l'oc\u00e9an\""
