Just two week ago at Indian Wells, Williams retired midmatch with Garbine Muguruza with an unspecified viral illness.\nThe 33-year-old Hsieh will play Caroline Wozniacki, who has been plagued by injuries, in the fourth round of the women's draw, which now looks wide open following Osaka's defeat and former world No. 1 Serena Williams' surprise exit with a left knee injury. It was an wonderful experience to play at the Hard Rock Stadium this year and would like to thank the Miami Open for putting on an awesome event,\"the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) quoted Williams as saying\".\n'I hope to be back next year to play at this one-of-a-kind tournament in front of the incredible fans here in Miami'.\n\"I just said, 'Okay, you're better than this, Serena'\".\nSerena Williams vs Rebecca Peterson highlights Miami Open 2019I couldn't lose this match. It was the first time in 64 matches that Osaka lost after winning the first set. 'I wasn't sure if there should be lights.\n\"Radu put me through the ringer\", Federer said. I have a lot of respect for those types of players who don't have the size, so have to find a different way to win. In the Key Biscayne's arena and she lastly lost to Naomi Osaka in the first round, she bade goodbye to the surface after that match where she previously won eight titles.\n\"I know - it's depressing\", she said.\nIt means that she has only completed seven official tour singles matches so far this year, although she did play three more at the Hopman Cup at the start of the year. I'm just really thankful I can be out there and play and compete."
