    "text": "When it comes to properly maintaining your residential, commercial, or industrial property a little effort certainly goes a long way. This statement holds especially true in keeping the plumbing appliances, plumbing fixtures, and even the entire plumbing system in good working order. In the long run a routine maintenance schedule will save you a great deal of time and money. Having your plumbing systems cleaned by an experienced professional, like Nu Flow Technologies, is necessary to avoid potential clogs, pipe breaks, or other expensive repairs.\nAlthough you may not give it much thought on a daily basis, your plumbing system is one of the most important operations of any property. Without water we simply cannot use the shower or tub to bathe, cook our food, or even clean our dishes and clothes. When a breakdown in the water or sewer system occurs it can be one of the most frustrating and stressful situations for a property owner to deal with. It can be much more serious than an annoying disturbance to the daily routine.\nYou are responsible for resolving the issue from a financial and decision-making standpoint. Unfortunately repairs to the water and sewer pipes are amongst the most expensive property fixes. The good news is that these costly and time consuming plumbing repairs can certainly be avoided. A regularly scheduled drain cleaning in Norman, Oklahoma can prevent breakdowns in the water system and sewer system at your home, place of business, or investment property or properties. Getting the process started is as easy as contacting Nu Flow Technologies to schedule an appointment.\nOne of our experienced field technicians will arrive at your property at the designated day and time. They will use a technologically advanced drain cleaning method called Hydro Jetting. The process uses highly pressurized water to clean the interior surfaces of the drain pipeline. The water effectively removes scales that build up over time and also eliminates grease and other debris that cling to the pipe walls. Hydro jetting is far more effective than other drain cleaning methods that basically punch through the debris buildup but does not actually completely flush it out of the system.\nThe technician must have the knowledge and experience to set the proper amount of water pressure for each individual application. It varies from one property to another based on the current pipe conditions, the materials that the pipes are manufactured with, and the severity of the debris buildup. If too little pressure is used it will not effectively clean the drainpipes. On the other hand if too much pressure is used than it can actually do severe damage to the drainpipes. That is exactly why it is so important to only work with a plumbing contractor that is an expert in hydro jetting technology.\nNu Flow Technologies is that expert. We use the right equipment at all times. In addition our technicians have years of experience, and have been fully trained to use the latest drain cleaning equipment, tools, and technology. We look forward to welcoming you to the Nu Flow family."
