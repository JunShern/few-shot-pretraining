    "text": "It\u2019s sometimes difficult to see progress. Often things change so slowly that we don\u2019t see the change happening. Like biological evolution, the changes we see in business and customer service are most often very gradual and hardly noticeable from day to day, they only happen over much longer periods. It\u2019s often surprising, if you look back in time at how much things have actually changed.\nMany of us will remember those days in the past when things were very different. If you\u2019re old enough, cast your mind back fifteen or twenty years and think of the number of loan sharks that were operating in Botswana. Do you remember how they were charging up to 30% interest per month? Do you remember how they were completely ignoring the \u201cin duplum\u201d rule, the rule that says that when a debt is settled the interest charged cannot exceed the remaining capital amount? Do you remember how they were routinely taking people\u2019s ATM cards and sometimes even their Omang cards as insurance that they would repay their loans? Do you remember how there were loan sharks operating from car parks, fried chicken restaurants and in one case I personally witnessed, from a government office?\nWe sent that consumer straight to NBFIRA who no doubt explained to the lender that their conduct was unacceptable and confined them in their dungeons.\nAlso in the past we had hire purchase. Yes, I know we still have it but we did have one minor success in making the cost of hire purchase easier to understand. You might remember that when items were advertised on \u201ccredit\u201d, the stores just advertised how much the deposit would be, the number of instalments you needed to make and how much each one would cost you. The stores were ignoring the legal requirement, as expressed in the Control of Goods (Marking of Goods) Regulations 1974 which says that when \u201cgoods are offered for sale on hire-purchase terms or by way of credit-sale or on any other terms as to deferred payment\u201d then the details shown must include \u201cthe total amount to be paid by way of deposit and instalments\u201d.\nWhen we first discovered this rule we wrote to the Managing Directors of all the stores that sell things on credit or hire purchase and asked them if they knew about this. To their credit, they almost all came back to us apologetically, saying they weren\u2019t aware of it and would change their advertising as soon as possible. One of them was a little bit less cooperative. It doesn\u2019t matter, they said, we abide by South African law. That\u2019s lovely, we told them, then go back to South Africa. In Botswana the laws of Botswana apply, not the laws of another country that you prefer. They eventually complied with the laws of the country that had welcomed them and allowed them to exploit its people.\nAnother thing that has changed, although not completely is the number of people with fake degrees. A number of highly publicised cases involving senior managers and academics who were exposed as having purchased degrees from unaccredited so-called \u201cuniversities\u201d has made us all a lot more aware of how skeptical we need to be about people\u2019s qualifications. Over the last eight years we\u2019ve warned readers about forty-five different establishments that claim to offer qualifications but none of which actually require their \u201cstudents\u201d to do any coursework, sit any exams, deliver any dissertations or do any actual work. All they\u2019ve ever required is a credit card number and then, as if by magic (or Mrs Mugabe) a degree certificate is in the post.\nNot all of these crooks have been pleased to be exposed. Several of them have threatened us with all sorts of consequences once they realised their scam was likely to dry up.\nOne of them, calling itself \u201cHeadway University\u201d even created a web site for a fake law firm calling itself \"Joyce & Nielsen\" who sent us an email demanding that we retract the accusation that Head way was bogus. They accused us of spreading \u201cdefamatory, harmful and malicious content in violation of state, federal and international law \u2026 with the intent to harm, defame and cause financial damages to our client, Headway University\u201d.\nI wasn\u2019t sure at the time how it is possible to defame a fake university that sells fake degrees to fake graduates. Defamation rests on the assumption that the victim has a reputation to protect. Peddlers of bogus qualifications are criminals. They had no reputation to lose.\nIt didn\u2019t take too much detective work to discover that the law firm didn\u2019t actually exist. The crooks behind the fake university had created an entirely fake web site to pretend that the law firm existed, even stealing the text on the web site from other, genuine law firms.\nUnfortunately, despite the crooks behind almost all of those bogus establishments being shut down they seem to be reappearing. Just a couple of weeks ago I chatted online to an \u201cadvisor\u201d from \u201cMartinville University\u201d who told me that for $500 I could get a degree in Nursing without sitting any exams. For $500 on top I could get a Masters degree as well and he said he would backdate the Bachelors degree to the pair of degrees looked more convincing to a potential employer.\nSo maybe things haven\u2019t changed that much after all?"
