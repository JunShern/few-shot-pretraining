    "text": "I\u2019ve been avoiding this topic but I write today to ask for your prayers because in one week from today Sarah will have surgery to remove kidney stones from her right kidney.\nWe found out she had them because she began having a urinary tract infection that came back after antibiotics. Our pediatrician sent us to a specialist and she had an ultrasound and a cat scan done which showed three stones. One is 2 cm, one is 1.5 cm and the other one is \u2013I can\u2019t remember\u2013but smaller. The doctors are intrigued by her because these stones are larger than they typically see for a child her age (5 and a half).\nLike most people, I get nervous about medical situations. I was very upset when we learned that she needed surgery and that the doctors couldn\u2019t tell us right away why she made the stones or what we can do to prevent this from happening again.\nShe has had no pain. no pain!\nmodern medicine and specialist doctors means they can be removed and everything will be done in an up-to-date and professional way.\nAlthough there is a chance she will need to have open surgery to remove the stones, at this point the plan is that it will be done robotically which means 4 tiny incisions and probably no stitches. They say she can probably go home the same day as the procedure.\nUltrasound and blood work was normal, and the infection at the time of the diagnosis was very minimal. She takes a preventative dose of antibiotics every day to keep the UTI away.\nalthough she does have a slight amount of \u201cgrit\u201d in her urine, her 24 hour urine test was also unremarkable (according to the doctor).\nall the doctors have been calm and unconcerned about this, which settles my emotions because THEY are the experts\u2026.and I am the over-reacting mother.\nin the grand scheme of things\u2026..kidney stones?? not a big deal. She appears perfectly healthy, in fact, she\u2019s brighter and happier than she\u2019s ever been (she loves going to school) and she\u2019s so smart!\nShe enjoyed her experience at the hospital and looks forward to going back. (so weird) LOL She especially loved the button that you could push to get a nurse to come and do things for you.\nI don\u2019t really want to talk about this, but I did want to let my friends know what was going on because it\u2019s on my mind, and usually the fears that I put out into the light tend to lessen in the sharing.\nI had to chuckle at Sarah \u2018enjoying\u2019 the hospital and looking forward to going back. That\u2019s such a blessing and a sweet way that God is looking after you\u2026that you know Sarah is not afraid. I totally understand your apprehension. It\u2019s normal! I would be worried if you weren\u2019t apprehensive about it. It sounds as if your doctors are confident, and you have the Lord on your side, most of all.\nI will be praying for you and your sweet youngest!\nI love you, too, Shanda. Big hugs back to you!\nMy daughter has had seven surgeries and that is her favorite part \u2013 all the attention! For what it\u2019s worth, I remember reading somewhere that removing dairy products was good for kidney stones. Worth a try anyway! I will keep Sarah in my prayers.\nOh shanda, I am praying for you and little Sarah! So glad you\u2019re sharing so we can pray, and looking at the positives. Dear Father,thankyou for caring about all the details of our lives. Please be with Shanda. Surround her with Your Presence, peace,and comfort. Remind her what a big God we have. Help the drs as they operate. Give them wisdom. Just let everything turn out for the best. Thankyou for never leaving us or forsaking us. Amen.\nKnow you are loved and trust that God will give you great grace in the midst of your fears which are normal and every mother would feel the same as you. I will gladly bear this burden for you in prayer on your behalf.\nI am here if you need me..text, call, ect.\nFor the choir director; on a stringed instrument. A Psalm of David.\nA tower of strength [a]against the enemy.\nOh, I can imagine what your mommy heart is experiencing, but Father God is right there, and He will not leave her, even when those doors close and you can\u2019t walk beside her holding her hand! She is healthy and will do fine. Soon it will be over and you will be wondering what you were so anxious about! Isn\u2019t it good to know we have that rock and refuge! Praying for you and Sarah!\nPraying for Peace that passeth all understanding thru all this!!\nI understand! I am that kind of mom. I am praying!\nPraying for you and Sarah. A mother\u2019s heart yearns over her children.\nPraying for you through this!!\nI will pray and keep praying, both for Sarah and for you dear mama. Isn\u2019t it good to know our Father has such tenderness towards us, and cares just as deeply for His children.\nPraying for you, and her! When my daughter was going thru a surgery when she was little, I was way worse than her! to her it was a adventure and she loved being the center of attention! May God give you the peace that passes all understanding!! and may you have a peace and calmness when the day arrives!\nShanda \u2013 I just saw this and want you to know I will also be praying for Sarah and you as the day approaches and finally the surgery. Praying the surgery can be done robotically and that she\u2019ll be able to go home with you the same day. She\u2019s such a cutie! Praying for peace for you dear Momma!\nCatching up on my blog backup! Love to you, Shanda. You are such a wonderful, tenderhearted mama. I\u2019m so sorry that Sarah has to go through this. I so relate to your feelings of anxiety about it. I pray for continued peace to rest on you, and that you feel Jesus walking you through this in a very real way. I also ask in Jesus\u2019 name that Sarah not have to go through this surgery ever again, and that her body would stop making these stones. Also asking for wisdom for you to know the best way to help her. Take care of yourself too!!"
