    "text": "I\u2019m Gail. I\u2019ve been a graphic designer for over 20 years and up to now I\u2019ve worked predominantly in pedestrian signage systems, exhibition and information design projects.\nThese projects have mostly involved the ordering and arrangement of words (typography) and mapping systems on physical products to help orientate and direct people around cities and spaces.\nBut at the Co-op in the digital team I\u2019m developing typographic guidance for designers and helping them create clear typographic hierarchies without using lots of different sizes and weights (which creates visual noise and makes things harder to read and understand).\nIn past projects this is what I\u2019ve done in the context of displaying information on physical products in physical environments. Now I\u2019m applying it to information on-screen.\nWhy am I now working in digital?\nJust over 2 years ago I moved from London to Manchester with my partner and daughter. After looking at the design industry in Manchester, I wondered where I fitted into this young, predominantly male, techie and advertising-led industry in which I had few established professional relationships.\nI came across the Ladies that UX group. The first meet-up I went to happened to be at the Co-op in Angel Square. A number of women from the digital team at the Co-op were speaking about their roles and how they had come to be there.\nThe panel were really encouraging about trying new things career-wise and taking a chance. Ben Terrett was also there and described the principles behind the development of Co-op digital products and services.\nThere were lots of parallels with my approach and ethos. At the end of the event, feeling pretty nervous, I approached Andrew Travers to talk to him about what I\u2019d been doing.\nI started by looking at how typography is being used across various products and services and using this information to develop specific typographic guidance for the use of Co-op\u2019s new typeface, Avenir Next. The size, position, colour, juxtaposition, vertical and horizontal spacing of type has a very practical job to do as well as fundamentally conveying the character of Co-op.\nFor the team that work on our brand I\u2019ve been developing ways of sharing information and best practice for using type, imagery and colour across digital and non-digital applications.\nI\u2019ve also had the opportunity to work on the Wills digital service.\nI spend a lot of my time moving bits of type up and down so that they look good as well as make sense as content (familiar ground) and wrestling with things like \u2018the fold\u2019, \u2018screen real estate\u2019 and CSS modules (unfamiliar ground).\nI like the fact that the Digital team at the Co-op is actively encouraging women to work with them and offers flexibility around work and family commitments.\nThere\u2019s been an open and positive reaction to me bringing my non-digital experience into the digital team. It\u2019s seen as being an advantage.\nLast week we began a series of Service Design workshops with our Food business.\nWe\u2019re working on a two week discovery phase by the end of which we\u2019ll pick three projects to take in Alpha.\nThe project is being led by myself and Jo Whitfield the Finance Director in Food. We\u2019re working with UsTwo as our service design partner. Importantly, as the unit of delivery is the team, our team is made up of CoopDigital, Food and UsTwo.\nThe team have visited stores, spoken to our colleagues, spent some time in a depot and with our call centre. We\u2019ve been out talking to customers and members.\nThere\u2019s lots to cover so we\u2019ve been sketching user journeys with colleagues from every part of the business. We\u2019re looking for clear user needs that will make things easier for members, customers or colleagues.\nAs we believe in working in the open, we\u2019ll blog about our progress on this blog.\nAt our AGM on Saturday, Richard shared with members the changes to Co-op Membership that will happen from Autumn this year.\nAs a member, everytime you buy Co-op branded products and services and use your card, you\u2019ll get 5% back on what you\u2019ve spent \u2013 from a loaf of bread to a funeral plan. You can then use that 5% anytime that you want to \u2013 against your next purchase or save it up for as long as you like.\nAs well as the 5% for you, 1% of the value of the Co-op branded products will also go to local causes that you help to choose.\nAs Ben said yesterday the simplicity of our new logo design is really going to make Co-op products and services stand out, so as a member you can see the items where you\u2019ll get something for you and something for your community.\nIt\u2019s important that our colleagues and Members\u2019 Council can easily explain membership (we know we\u2019ve made it hard for them in the past) and we also want them to be able to feedback on the experience. This is why over the summer they\u2019ll have access to new Co-op membership first, followed in the Autumn by the rest of our members.\nBut we aren\u2019t going to stop there. We\u2019ll keep looking at ways to make being a Co-op member even better. And, like Mike said on Saturday we\u2019re committed to radical transparency so we\u2019ll be sharing our progress here on the blog. As a start, in the next few weeks we\u2019ll share the work we\u2019ve done so far looking at how we can create new ways to give members a voice in their Co-op."
