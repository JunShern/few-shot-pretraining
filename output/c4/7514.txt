    "text": "If you\u2019re familiar with the French language, you may have already figured out that the Grand Basset Griffon Vend\u00e9en originated in France. The predecessors of the GBGV\u2014short-legged hunting hounds\u2014appeared at the first dog shows in France in the 1860s. As time went on, French hunting dogs became more and more differentiated, and one of the resulting breeds was the GBGV.\nBecause poor huntsmen could not afford horses, they could not keep up with fast, large hounds. While the aristocrats followed their large hunting dogs on horseback, peasants followed slower dogs on foot. This is why the basset breeds, including the GBGV, were bred to have short legs.\nGrand Basset Griffon Vend\u00e9ens typically go hunting in packs, as Beagles and foxhounds do. GBGVs are scent hounds that track game primarily by using their noses.\nGrand Basset Griffon Vend\u00e9ens were used to hunt wolves and deer, while Petit Basset Griffon Vend\u00e9ens were used to hunt rabbit, hare, and sometimes birds. But the PBVB and GBVB did not become separate breeds until the 1970s. The litters used to be interbred, and the puppies were separated by size. Today, there are other key differences in these two breeds besides size. In proportion to their height, the GBVB has have a longer muzzle, longer ears, a longer back, and a longer tail.\nLet\u2019s break down the full name: \u201cGrand\u201d is a French word that means large, so it fits the bigger version of the two Basset Griffon Vend\u00e9en breeds. \u201cBasset\u201d means low. \u201cGriffon\u201d is a type of wire coat, and \u201cVend\u00e9en\u201d comes from Vend\u00e9e, the region of France where the breed originated.\n6. They Only Recently Came to the U.S.\nThe first GBGV to come to the United States came in 1990, and the first litter was born in 1994. They remain few in number in the U.S. today."
