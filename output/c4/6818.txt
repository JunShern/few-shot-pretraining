And a lot of people have suggested for a while that the Lion could be up next.\nSo what do we think? Are these rumours rubbish, or do you think these could all be true? Is the Lion hitting stores before Christmas? Let us know your thoughts by commenting on this post or alternately via one of our social media channels.\nWe shall also be discussing the new upcoming codexes on our next podcast. Missed the first one? Check it out here.\nOur thanks to \u2018Inner Circle\u2019 and Natfka for this information."
