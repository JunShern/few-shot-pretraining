    "text": "I started my day with my To-Do list on my mind and relating to it as my Not- Done list. My inner critic was taunting me like it is a What- Have-You-Even-Done?!?! List....It had me in an internal battle of positive and negative thoughts all morning.\nNeedless to say, my thoughts had been cloudy and bogged down. It felt heavy. I didn't exactly jump out of bed ready to seize the day or to inspire anybody as I normally do.\nI started today in my woes about a half unpacked apartment, a ton of emails to check, write, and respond to, and more to-do's comin' down the pipe. Essentially, I woke up a little less than grateful.\nNoticing this, I began affirming myself and my life out loud.\n\"I love my new space, my job, my Jeep, my peeps, etc...\"\n....and I still felt heavy.\nI was sulking until the moment that I saw this beautiful woman's status! I read it and immediately picked my chin up and looked forward into 2020.\nI had realized in that very moment, what I was sulking in was my current circumstances. My vision was so clouded that the sun could not shine through and I could not see forward into the future.\nThe way we act in the present is very predictably dictated by the future that we are 'living into.' It is a pretty certain fact, if I say so myself. If you're living in to a heavy to-do list, you will feel heavy.\nIf you are living into a declared future of creative expression, the same to-do list can look a lot brighter!\nI know what I'm living for.\nI know what I'm up to in this world and I am certainly grateful to honor the callings and tugs of my heart! Everything I'm up to is in service of the greater good. That to-do list that I woke up stressed about is in service of the greater good.\nNothing shifted in my life except for my mind state. I gave up the bogged down story and grabbed back onto positive impact.\nSince that moment, I released a new Hearts Unleashed Podcast episode, had 3 client calls, worked a full work day, sent off four emails, scheduled 3 appointments, updated my website, and more! Letting go of my pity party allowed me to grab back on to life BEING a party!!!\nGina, thank you for bringing my feet back to the ground today! You helped me stand back on the foundation that I have laid while keeping my head in the clouds and dreaming about all that I am creating!\nYou are an amazing woman and every tiny act of kindness that you do creates a giant tidal wave of positove ripple effect!\nThank you for today's inspiration and for being the amazing woman that you are! LOVE YOU!\nFunny enough, today's 15 Min Fill Up episode is all about 'doing the work' of clearing your head and heart so that you can keep 'doing the work' that you were born to do!!! Please, check it out!!"
