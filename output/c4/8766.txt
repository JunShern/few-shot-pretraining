    "text": "This project was first announced just ahead of harvest 2016. The intent of the announcement was just to give producers an opportunity to practice and/or focus a little more attention on their ros\u00e9 wine heading into 2017. I listed, as an example, some potential parameters we may look at as a means of unifying the wine style, and strengthening the brand.\nThe 2nd part is where you all come in. We\u2019re going to create an opportunity for group blind evaluations of several ros\u00e9 wines. In January and early February, I will hold 3 sensory training/evaluation workshops. These workshops will be open to grape and wine producers, retailers, distributors, food professionals, and other advocates for our industry. We\u2019ll have a lot of work to do, and they\u2019ll run at least 4 hrs, probably scheduled from 1-5. Because of this, and because our budget is limited, there will be a cost to participants to cover venue and food costs associated with the event.\nNovember 2016 Roundtable meetings, collection of wines for analysis \u2013 done!\nApril 2017 Create competition category for Illinois Ros\u00e9, include parameters established by 1st sensory workshop.\nMarch 2018 Launch marketing campaign to public, begin assessing wines from 2017 harvest?\nYou must RSVP to attend this event. Send RSVPs to brad@illinoiswine.com. The suggested donation will be $10/person (at the door).\nThat\u2019s all for now. Best to all of you this holiday season!"
