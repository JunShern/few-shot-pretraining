    "text": "With a show of online head nods, how many people who are reading this remembers how did they win or how did they lose?\nAnd why is that? It's because when you are playing a match, everyone tends to autopilot specific sequences, which can be good or bad, based on the player you are going against \u2014 but in the end its not something to be proud of.\nOne thing about growing as a player is to try to have multiple styles for your character.\nNow this part isn't very easy, because if you are usually an defensive player, than most of the time your offense is not amazing. Same goes with having a strong offense, but that doesn't mean you should ignore having a good defense as well.\nIn this chapter, I will be explaining the benefits of having different styles and why it will help you win in certain scenarios/match ups.\nI watch a lot of fighting game streams and there are many times where I see people in the chat type \"Downloaded\" or \"He got figured out.\"\nThis chapter will focus on how to distinguish that YOU are being downloaded, and once you do realize that you are being downloaded, how to interrupt the download, and continue on playing YOUR game.\nMany people do not even realize that the download has already begun. Here is a common one that happens a lot but people do not realize it.\nSince Capcom Cup is in a couple of months and this tier list was long overdue I decided to work on it now.\nIt's to give you guys some information maybe that you need to win or some motivation to pick up a new character.\nAnd please remember this is my opinion on all these characters and anyone can disagree or agree.\nI will have a grade system running from S+, S, S-, A+, A, A- B+, B, B-, C+ C, C- and D with S+ being highest and D being lowest.\nI will be providing which gem set should be best with the characters. There are only 5 tournament default gems and will be numbering them from 1-5.\nExample: 1 is the three power gems and 2 is the three defense power gems and etc. We will start with the Capcom Cast first. (Will not be doing Toro, Kuro, Megaman, and Pac-Man).\nThere will be times when you will fight someone completely brand new, and you do not have the data on how to deal with newly fought opponents.\nThis chapter will talk about on what kind of things that you can do to figure out what type of opponent you will be playing against.\nAt a tournament not everyone you come across will be a top player, good player, average player or even a bad player. How can you determine what type of player is a \"Johnny Doughnuts?\" Now if you think about what the highest level of players can do, they usually have the following qualities.\nHey guys, this time this tier list will consist of the cast in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3. Now before I start I just want to say this is my opinion on all these characters and anyone can disagree or agree.\nHit the link below to check out the list.\nHey everyone, these next few articles will be interesting. I will be providing my opinion on how each of the characters in Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition v2012 rank, before branching into other games.\nI'll give an overview of what their pros and cons are, and who would be a good partner if you need a secondary character.\nI will have a grade system running from S+, S, S-, A+, A, A- B+, B, B- and C, with S+ being highest and C being lowest.\nI have been playing a lot of Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition v2012 and Street Fighter X Tekken v2013 online recently and its been really fun.\nI played many high ranked players and they know their frame traps, setups, option selects and match ups. They would probably do very well in tournament.\nNow, the downside of being an online warrior is that you will have bad habits and you will also be guessing a lot on wake up, jumping a lot or mashing an invincible move out all the time.\nEvery region or area, there will be that person who is the best on their block. That person can also be a trend setter on what the community will use or what does that specific community deem top tier. Knowing this information is extremely important if you like to travel a lot for tournaments or if you are an up and comer player who doesn't know much outside of YOUR community.\nHere is a list of examples that you can see what I mean. There may be more players I might have forgotten but you will understand the concept.\nStep Up Your Game: Chapter 9 - What did I do wrong?\nYou're ready for the tournament and you believe you will beat some top players, make top 8 or even win the tournament. But then something happens... You don't beat any top players, or make top 8 or even win the tournament at all.\nI think a lot of players have potential talent and they could possibly be the next top player, but they might have the jitters and choke in tournament. You think to yourself that wasn't me playing up there, I usually do a lot better when I am playing casuals in my boxers at home.\nHere are some things you need to do to improve at the next tournament.\n1. Have a video recording of all your matches, win and losses.\n2. Study them and try to realize the faults in the matches.\n3. Think about what you could have done better (a more damaging combo).\n4. Practice against the technique that caused your loss.\n5. Run it back the next tournament.\nThere has been a lot of fighting games that have came out after the release of Street Fighter 4. We have Marvel vs Capcom 3, Mortal Kombat 9, Street fighter X Tekken, Skullgirls, King of Fighters 13 and many more.\nA lot of the times, the majority of people are big fighting games fans and would love to play multiple fighting titles well at tournaments. All too often, it takes too much time to absorb the fighting game knowledge from that game and apply it when it comes time to play in a tournament.\nI will be giving some tips on how to approach a new game and how to learn it quickly.\nA lot of players have trouble deciding which character(s) to pick in Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition v2012. Here is my breakdown on what characters might fit your offensive, defensive, or balanced style.\nThe next couple of chapters, I will be focusing on how to find your team or character(s) in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition v2012, Street Fighter X Tekken and whatever games that YOU guys want me to explain to the best of my ability on how to pick characters.\nIt is really hard to find a team that fits your particular style in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3. I want to break down how I feel a character should be played, by separating them into three categories; Rush Down, Runaway/Keep away and Safe Rush \u2014 the latter of which meaning they can do both rush down and runaway/keep away.\nAs everyone knows, there are so many different types of fighting games, and its hard to play all of them. It is difficult to change from a fast pace Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 mindset to an Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition v2012 mindset, etc. The most common flaw is that many people leave traces of their SSF4 AE v2012 gameplay in their UMvC3 gameplay (I won't blow up any names *laughs*).\nYou can tell when you see someone just sit there and try to block a dangerous mixup in UMvC3. In my opinion, when you are playing a game like Marvel, I believe that you should always be moving with your character as fast as possible. Mobility is super important in Marvel, while in SSF4 AE v2012, sitting back and defending is far more important.\nThere comes to a point where a player has reached a certain level that they cannot plateau any higher. Now they are desperately doing worse, not as confident as before, and their drive is slowly drifting away. You practiced your combos in the training room, you beat the computer senseless a million times, and you have exposed yourself in a tournament environment. What else is missing? Why am I doing worse? It\u2019s an easy answer that most people don\u2019t realize. Your love of the game is lost. All you want to do now is to win and prove yourself to the community that you\u2019re a top player.\nThis is a very common situation for lots of players, but having love for the game or for your character will show a lot more signs of improvement than someone whose only interest is to win. If you look at the player DJ Huoshen on how he play and how he reacts to things. You can tell that he loves to play with the team he uses; Felicia/Skrull/Taskmaster. He loves this game and he takes the game as it is. He understands that the game is cheap and his characters have a high chance of losing but he makes it work and still comes out on top. Why? Because he loves to play the game. He doesn\u2019t just care about winning. Winning is nice but staying true to your heart means a lot more and that\u2019s where winning matters the most.\nThis obviously doesn\u2019t mean that if you pick the character you like, you will win all your matches. There are broken things in every game that will just prevent your success. *Cough* Phoenix *Cough* but as long as you tried your best and your love in the game will be there, you will have a much more clearer outlook on things and what little things to improve on for your next match, tournament, and etc.\nOne of the hardest things to achieve is being able to play the way you want to play under a huge amount of pressure. Some players love the pressure and some players despise it. I personally love playing under pressure. I believe that I make some of the best comebacks when I am under pressure which is how the \u201cWong Factor\u201d came up. Many players have gotten some awesome comeback victories when a huge crowd is watching. We have Peter \u201cBionic Arm\u201d Rosas, Daigo \u201cLets Go Justin\u201d Umehara and many more.\nIn order to see if you can play under pressure, you can do the following things.\nPlay on an online stream such as Peaceful Jay or Shoryuken.\nTravel to a local tourney and see how well you do in the tourney with actual people.\nWhat is a Training Mode Monster? A Training Mode Monster is someone who has great execution in terms of combos in the Training Room. Most common problems are that majority of the players are Training Mode Monsters which means that in an actual match, their execution goes down by a lot.\nNot being able to land your combos against a moving target (Computer/Human opponent) is what a lot of players suffer from.\nThere are ways to increase your percentage of being able to land your combos against moving targets or in high pressure situations. When I was growing up, I played against the computer every day. Even though the computer isn\u2019t really challenging, it still gives you an opportunity to land combos in many types of situations and not just a non-movable dummy. The computer will stand, crouch, jump, spam an unsafe move and more, but this is beneficial for the player because you will be able to change up the type of combos due to the situation."
