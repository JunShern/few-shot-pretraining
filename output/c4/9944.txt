    "text": "The Michigan Chapter of the Antique and Classic Boat Society had nearly 200 boats lined up in the Black River between Seventh and 10th streets. The previous record for an ACBS International Boat Show was 146.\nIt's unlikely they would ever see so many beautiful powerboats in one place again.\nTim and Colette Carlsen of St. Clair check out two 1959 Chris-Craft Silver Arrows during the Antique and Classic Boat Society International Boat Show on Saturday, Sept. 15, 2018.\nClaude Simpson came from Almont on Saturday \"to look at the old Chris-Crafts.\n\"I think they're beautiful boats,\" he said. \"I wish I was 20 years old \u2014 I'd buy one.\n\"It's a shame when you get enough money to buy one, you're too old to have one.\"\nTim and Colette Carlson, of St. Clair, were admiring not one, but twin 1959 Chris-Craft Silver Arrows. The boats have the same styling as passenger cars from the era, with wide tailfins and two-tone paint jobs.\n\"We just came to see the beautiful boats,\" Tim Carlsen said.\nThey were enjoying the diversity of watercraft at the Antique and Classic Boat Society International Boat Show.\n\"We were just talking about how extraordinary it is,\" Colette Carlsen said. \"There are so many boats here we haven't seen before.\"\nThe Impulse gleams during the Antique and Classic Boat Society International Boat Show on Saturday, Sept. 15, 2018.\nKen Bessey of Tawas and his family and friends got a ride in the Rum Runner, which started life as a 1949 Hacker-Craft triple cockpit, but was converted to a commuter-style boat in 2005.\n\"It was great,\" Bessey said about the experience. \"It's a beautiful boat, and it runs great.\"\nNine-year-old Mason Halsey was enjoying a pop in the stern of the America, a 1961 Matthews cruiser owned by David Maize of Harsens Island.\n\"It's fun to ride in,\" Mason said. \"It has a loud engine. That's what I like.\"\nMike Weber, of Marine City, and Ken Radjewski, of Harsens Island, both own antique boats, but they left them at home to come enjoy the Port Huron show.\nRadjewski said he owns a 1956 Chris-Craft skiff.\n\"It was my Dad's, and when my Dad passed away, I took them over and bought the boathouse and the boat,\" he said. \"It's just a hobby.\"\nHe said he hadn't seen such a display of antique boats before.\n\"I've been to them in Florida,\" Radjewski said. \"I've been to them in Algonac, and I've been to them Up North.\n\"This is the biggest display I've ever seen.\"\nLarry and Glenda Day came from Clarkston to look at the boats.\nThe Wave Trotter heads out with riders during the Antique and Classic Boat Society International Boat Show on Saturday, Sept. 15, 2018.\n\"We both love the woodworking,\" Glenda Day said, \"and this is an awesome display of that.\"\nMichael and Chris Flood brought two boats up from Clay Township, a 1972 Chris-Craft Commander and a 1937 Hacker-Craft triple cockpit.\n\"It's incredible,\" Michael Flood said about the show. \"I had no idea it would turn out so good.\"\nTim Butson, a custom boat builder from Bobcaygeon, Ontario, brought a Muskoka-style boat called Impulse to the show. He said the watercraft is modeled on a gentleman's Gold Cup raceboat from the late 1920s.\n\"It's a wonderful venue,\" he said. \"We've been to a number of international shows before.\n\"(But) this one is extremely unique because of the amount of big boats in the show. It's something that is completely different from the normal boat show.\""
