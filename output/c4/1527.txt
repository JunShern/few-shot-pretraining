We will be doing lots of predicting of what will happen next, as well as practising using the four sentence types in our writing: statements, commands, questions and exclamations.\nWe will start the term by revising our methods for the four operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) before using these skills to begin to solve more complication missing number problems and word problems. We will then move onto solving problems involving money, before recapping reading and showing the time on clock faces.\nOur topic this term is \u2018Sensational Safaris!\u2019 We will be focussing on Kenya and comparing the similarities/differences to our location in England. We will learn about the animals found in Kenya, and those that could be spotted on safari, as well as learning about the Maasai culture. Children will also have the opportunity to compare their lives to those lives of children in Kenya.\nThis term, we will be learning about Islam, focusing on the learning question \u2018Who is a Muslim and what do they believe?\u2019. During this topic, we will be learning about the Prophet Muhammad and some of the stories about his life, as well as finding out about mosques and reflecting on places/objects that we find special.\nWe will be learning all about plants this term. We will be planting our own bulbs and seeds, making predictions on which conditions are best for plants to grow in and making observational conclusions. We will also explore the life cycle of plants and compare different plants, fruits and vegetables.\nThis term, we will be having P.E on Monday afternoons, however please ensure that P.E kits are in school at all times."
