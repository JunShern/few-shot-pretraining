This is the tool for you! Whether you are a screen caster or want to store some passwords or logins for those repeat uses, this app can help you work more efficiently and prevent slowdowns on live shows while you type in that long confusing password... repetedlu\u2026 Repetedly\u2026 Repeated;ly\u2026 Repeatedl\u2026\u2026. Simply make a label reminder for you to easily reference the content (Optional), store the hidden value and hit save, after that you can single click copy to clipboard that piece of text ready to rapidly paste into anywhere it is needed. Important Notice: This app is not designed to be a secure vault or password locker it is for those repeat use words and the added benefit for them not to be easily seen if you do a lot of screen recording or when hosting a live show, even if it is not important that it is seen, it can also be used to avoid having to type a long word or constantly used piece of text, you can use spaces in the secret values as well. For multi-line text, chances are it is not important to be hidden and for those types of text you can search the store for my other app TeNotes. This app was designed to serve my needs and as such encryption was not an essential however it is planned to be included in future. The login pin is only a safety mechanism, if someone has access to your account on your computer, then they have access to the stored data as well, the idea was for scenarios where perhaps you left the app open and your child accidently managed to clear a stored value or simply just a basic security feature for similar scenarios or preventing easy access to that content if you let a friend sit on your computer for a minute or two. KISS is primarily designed for use on a desktop machine, however it is available across Windows 10 Desktops, Mobiles and HoloLens. Click the ... epsilon at the bottom of the app for help."
