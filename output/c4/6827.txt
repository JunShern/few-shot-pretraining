    "text": "A circular bass sax riff, a trumpet used to modulate and amplify the sound of breathing, drums that ape the ripples on a stone-struck pond, a random constellation of bass points, gong-like chimes from a malletted lap-held guitar\u2026 these are the initial ingredients that we are presented with. And then the five musicians begin to collectively stir the pot.\nThis set is a shifting, roiling continuous experiment in sound. Not always so musical, at times almost anti-music (although if anyone in the room can define \u201cmusic\u201d to everyone\u2019s satisfaction, I\u2019d love to hear it) but fascinating in the extreme \u2013 all the more so for the visual component of being able to watch the creation process.\nFor the breath-driven instruments, Besalduch and Pope tinker with the interface between mouth and mouthpiece, sometimes dispensing with the mouthpiece entirely. Carrasco\u2019s guitar is rarely on the strap, more often across the lap or held upright, and frequently bristles with muting clips or has the most un-guitarlike tones dragged from it by a bow. Varela\u2019s drumheads might be stroked by rubber-headed mallets and R\u00f3denas at one point lays the bass flat and strokes the strings with a rod to produce some sort of unearthly low-end theremin. The volume balance sometimes means Pope and Carrasco are drowned out a little but the finer moments are those when one or two instruments emerge from the maelstrom and are allowed moments of delicacy \u2013 and everyone gets a turn, solo or duo.\nAll in all, maybe best described as a series of experiments in timbre and frequency in which the rough edges served to enhance the moments of purity.\nJord\u00e0 is first off with his trademark minimalist sopranino. Sans is a blur at the drumkit, providing a cascade of accents with skin, rim and cymbal. Caicedo\u2019s beautifully-toned old Telecaster emits fractured and disjointed space-blues riffs. Mar\u00edn\u2019s clarinet cries and moans, evocatively stabbing the air. And it\u2019s Lloses who runs with the introductory high jinks, using the inflated silver winebag to hammer and caress the keys, creating percussive splashes and long chromatic runs in the cacophony.\nSimilar to the first set, nothing stands still. Jord\u00e0 switches to wooden (bamboo?) flute as the volume drops momentarily, allowing his earthy Eastern tone and Caicedo\u2019s fragmented riffs to come to the fore; closely followed by Mar\u00edn blowing through the clarinet keys, adding a barely discernible filigree to the overall sound. Prompted by a short (too short!) drum & guitar moment, the energy seems to coalesce and Sans and Caicedo are joined by Lloses on toy piano (while elbowing bass notes on the full-size version next to him), Mar\u00edn using another inflated bag for gunshot percussive sounds, and Jord\u00e0\u2019s dervish sopranino dancing above it all. Incidentally, the cymbal scrape may be a common enough experimental percussion technique but I\u2019m more and more certain that nobody does it with such nuance as Ivo Sans. He somehow can precisely manipulate the resulting sound so that what seems like a sequence of tones emerge clearly.\nFor more information on BCN Impro Fest, check out the festival blog at bcnimprofest.tumblr.com and the Facebook page for Sala F\u00e8nix.\nThe 3rd session of the BCN Impro Fest will be held at Sala F\u00e8nix on Tuesday 23rd February.
