    "text": "Sacred Spirits Company Ltd., Highgate, London (found about 100 yards from the top of Highgate Hill, the highest point in London), England, UK.\nRunning up to 2008, with the financial and economic down turn at that time, former Derivatives trader turned city headhunter Ian Hart found himself at a loose at the end. He tried his hand at a hand full of ideas before looking to improve wine from poor vintages using cold distillation techniques with a vacuum still. Whilst this method of wine improvement was successful he realized it wouldn\u2019t unfortunately be viable as a commercial project. So, armed with this new equipment to \u201cplay with\u201d, and being a keen Gin drinker, he turned to making this spirit. After much trial and error, not to mention ample amounts of creative ingenuity and knowledge gained from his Cambridge degree in Natural Sciences, in 2009 he started his own micro distillery.\nJoined by his life partner and co-founder Hilary Whitney, this is not your usual distillery. Operated from their residential home there are no traditional copper pot stills, instead it looks like a small chemistry lab in a family room looking over the backyard. With the garage and children\u2019s playhouse providing storage facilities, an informal tasting group helping them agree upon their 23rd recipe (loosely based on one from 1660), their original Sacred Gin was launched in May 2009.\nThis botanical flavored Gin using Pink Grapefruit we believe was launched around 2011.\nThe botanicals are distilled separately, undergoing 3 different macerations (one with alcohol and a further two with water) to get the very last bit of flavor out of each, before being distilled. The process uses triple distilled English wheat grain spirit (bought in from the Master of the Worshipful Company of Distillers) where the botanical macerations are distilled in glassware under reduced temperature and pressure in a vacuum using either a 2-liter of a 6-liter Rotavapor. Each resultant distillate is blended and hydrated with purified water to produce the final Gin. We have simplified the process but Ian Hart has added many aspects to it including vapor extraction at three different boiling points, cooling using 2 different methods to capture every drop and methods to prevent oxygen contamination. Sacred were certainly the first to use vacuum distillation in London (if not England) and we suspect are the first to use this particular and unique set-up for distillation. This Gin is made from a blend of 95% Spanish citrus paradisi (pink grapefruit) distillate (including the peel, pith, juice & pips) and 5% from juniper, orris and angelica distillates.\nThe Gin is presented in a tall clear cylindrical bottle with rounded shoulders and a medium length neck. The label has evolved through several changes and the most recent was implemented in November 2011 by brand design consultancy Elmwood. In general the labels are colored purple with Gold foil and the lettering \u201cSacred\u201d and \u201cPink Grapefruit\u201d written on it, plus an image of a crown. The new design is dominated with individually styled iron gates based on the famous Highgate Cemetery gates. Key aspects of the design include: Hearts lining the top of the crown referring to co-founder Ian surname; Serpents abound as these are said to guard the Frankincense tree (one of the botanicals); Ink pen nibs form the hinges of the gates as a nod to the many literary greats buried at Highgate Cemetery and the journalistic career of co-founder Hilary; the subtle images of birds are discreetly placed representing the Nightingales found throughout the Highgate woodland; and we also like the use of the laboratory style glassware images scattered around too.\nFlavored Gin - Pink Grapefruit.\n$$$$$ - $$$$$$. Not available in the USA but try online direct from Sacred Spirits, Master of Malt or The Drink Shop. All of these are UK based so be prepared for additional shipping costs.\nUses 4 organically sourced botanicals including: angelica root, juniper berries, pink grapefruit and orris.\nNamed after the Boswellia sacra tree (also known as Hougary Frankincense), one of the 12 botanicals used in the original Sacred Gin, and the key flavoring botanical for this Gin.\nOn the nose is light sweet citrus (pink grapefruit) with peppery notes. On the palate is a strong sweet refreshing citrus (pink grapefruit) taste with spiced pepper notes. On the close the flavor profile continues with zesty tongue tingling citrus (pink grapefruit) and pepper on a long fresh finish.\nThis is a quality Gin and can be drunk neat providing you like the taste of strong zesty citrus. However, we found it much better (the citrus being tamed somewhat) in mixed drinks. The bitterness of a Pink Gin or a Gin and Tonic matches well with the citrus, as do the herbal qualities of Vermouth in a wet Martini. Strangely enough we really liked a Gin and bitter lemon or lemonade made with this spirit from Sacred.\nOverall this is yet another excellent quality Gin from Sacred Spirits, with the citrus flavor not too unfamiliar to most Gin drinkers, albeit stronger than many would expect. It is certainly worthwhile trying this as it is more than a just a novelty flavored spirit and we have no reservations in recommending this Gin."
