    "text": "Everybody loves a lazy Sunday, right? A long lie-in, newspapers in bed (or your tablet, of course, if you are more technically minded) and perhaps a trip out in the afternoon or taking that opportunity to binge-watch your favourite Netflix series.\nOf course, all of this is only possible if you don&apos;t work on Sundays - which, of course, a lot of people do. Weekend work is par for the course for certain industries, such as retail, hospitality or the emergency services (and journalism!).\nAnd some people love it or, at least, it suits them - perhaps because it fits in with their lifestyle or because they like having time off during the week.\nThere will be instances, however, when you may need to spend time with your family, or ease up on the amount of shifts you&apos;re doing.\nThis is, potentially, where one little known law could come in handy and the Mirror Online has looked into it.\nWorkers in certain industries don&apos;t actually have to work on Sundays - and can opt out if they so choose.\nAgain, all staff should be have been told about these Sunday working rights when they first started work.\nLooking for a change of career? Of course, we at the Derby Telegraph always want to help you find a new job if you&apos;re looking and you can look, any time, at our dedicated Fish4Jobs website for new vacancies.\nAn original version of this story has appeared on the Mirror Online."
