But over the last 75 years, Rico Industries has earned an unparalleled reputation for trust and integrity among its customers, vendors, and industry peers.\nFounded in May 1944 by three immigrant relatives, Rico Industries began manufacturing wallets from scrap leather. The second generation continued this tradition of hard work and excellent service as Rico became the top supplier of private label wallets to various major retailers in the U.S.A. Its reputation as a vendor led those customers to ask Rico to distribute other companies\u2019 products, including many sports licensees \u2013 which Rico had also become in 1984 \u2013 continuing as the third generation began to operate the family business.\nRico bought one of those other companies in 2000, Tag Express, improving on its delivery and service to become one of the top hardgood licensees for the NFL, MLB, NBA, NHL, and many colleges and universities. As the fourth generation joined the business, the company grew with two more acquisitions in 2009 \u2013 Big League Promotions and Tags By Design. In 2013 Rico launched its first brand, SPARO, starting with a line of fashionable sports-licensed watches.\nPoised for continued growth in the years ahead, Rico Industries has kept and will always keep those values it started with \u2013 telling the truth, seeing a job through to the end, keeping its promises \u2013 close to heart.\nIf you have a Retail Sales Tax ID, contact us at info@ricoinc.com for more information or to place an order.\nYour email has been successfully sent and we appreciate you contacting us.\nWe are here to answer any questions you may have about our Rico experiences.

If you are the owner or representative of a new product that might fit with Rico\u2019s business, this site can help you submit your product idea for review by Rico.\nWe want to make it easy for current and potential partners to reach out to us with products ideas that may be of interest to our business. Whether you're a previous partner or brand new to Rico, the information in this section will help answer your questions about how to reach out to Rico.\nFollow the process below to submit your product idea to Rico.\nIf your product idea fits the criteria below, we invite you to submit your idea.\nWe are looking for matches for the product or business needs of Rico. Please look at Rico\u2019s products on this website to see the types of consumer products Rico sells.\nProduct ideas should also include protectable intellectual property, typically in the form of a granted patent or trademark or published patent application or published trademark application. Rico cannot advise you on whether or not to pursue a patent, trademark or other form of intellectual property protection. For more information regarding the nature of intellectual property and its uses, you should consult your legal representative or appropriate government agencies, for example, the United States Patent and Trademark Office.\nProduct ideas which you do not own or have the full legal right to represent, or about which you are unable to provide information on a nonconfidential basis.\nConfidential information or documents. Remember, all information submitted must be nonconfidential. Do not submit confidential information. We will not review any documents that are marked \u2018Confidential\u2019 or the equivalent. The documents will be deleted from our system, and the submission will be automatically declined.\nIdeas, suggestions or thoughts that do not include protectable intellectual property.\nDesigns for use on any product you do not own or control. This includes designs for use on current Rico products.\nA fully signed Rico New Product Submission Agreement in the form of the link which will apply to all products you may submit to Rico at any time. Please do not alter the form. Rico will not consider any submission that alters this form in any manner.\nFor each product you wish Rico to consider, you also must fully complete and sign a Rico New Product Information Questionnaire in the form of the link for that product. One product per questionnaire. Please do not combine product answers for multiple products in one Rico New Product Information Questionnaire, as if you do so Rico will not consider that submission. Also, we need clear, concise answers and responses to each question in the Rico New Product Information Questionnaire for each product.\nCopies of any safety, chemical, consumer, or other relevant testing as required in the Rico New Product Information Questionnaire.\nAnything you submit to Rico will not be returned to you, including any samples you may send.\nThe following frequently asked questions provide helpful information about our submission and review process, including more about how to submit a product idea to Rico, what happens to the information you provide after it reaches us, and what kinds of responses you can expect to receive.\nWill Rico sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement before I share my product idea?\nNo. Rico will only consider non-confidential information for its initial review of your submission. If after our initial review of a submission, we find that we may have interest in learning more, we will contact you to discuss how to proceed and any needed agreements.\nHow can I arrange to present my product idea in person or via electronic means?\nYou cannot arrange for an in person presentation or any presentation via electronic means (including phone, internet, or teleconferencing methods). Our initial review is based wholly on the non-confidential information you provide in your submission. Face-to-face meetings, phone conferences, internet conferences, teleconferences or live demonstrations are typically not required at this stage. If Rico desires any such meeting, conference or demonstration, Rico will notify you.\nHow can I present my product idea to Rico in a manner different than outlined in Rico\u2019s New Product Submission Process?\nIn order to submit any new product idea to Rico, you must fully comply with Rico\u2019s New Product Submission Process. Thus, you cannot present any new product idea to Rico in any other manner. If you attempt to submit any product idea to Rico in any manner other than as outlined in Rico\u2019s New Product Submission Process, it will not be reviewed, everything you submit will be deleted from our system, and the submission will be automatically declined.\nWho will review my submission, and how long will it take?\nEach submission is handled by Rico\u2019s New Product Coordinator who manages the process and determines how to route it to ensure it reaches the relevant personnel within Rico. In many cases, this means review by multiple people to evaluate merit or strategic business fit for Rico.\nWe are committed to reaching a decision as quickly as possible. However, a thorough initial review may take as long as twelve weeks to complete.\nIn the event that we need additional information or samples, we will contact you.\nIn the meantime, we ask that you be patient and not contact our executives or other employees regarding your submission. Unfortunately, we will not take your calls or respond to any communication you send us other than the initial submission. Even if you have not yet heard from us, we are working on it!\nWhat is my protection? How can I be assured my product idea won\u2019t be taken?\nRico is committed to doing the right thing. It\u2019s who we are. We also know that we\u2019re only as good, only as trustworthy as our last partnership. We enter every business arrangement with that in mind!\nWe appreciate the value of protecting the \u201cintellectual property\u201d behind any product. If you have something of real value, you want to protect it so others can\u2019t duplicate it!\nThat\u2019s why, when you submit a product idea to us, we state over and over again: only send non-confidential information. Anything that is proprietary \u2013 anything that would enable someone to duplicate your product idea \u2013 should not be part of your submission. We do this to protect your interests; but also to protect us, as well. We urge you to consult with your attorney prior to making any submission to us to protect your interests. Please understand that just because you send us a product idea does not mean you have rights to it or that Rico hasn\u2019t already been developing the same product or someone else has already submitted the same idea to Rico or the product is already in the marketplace. If you truly have a protectable interest in the product idea submitted to Rico, Rico simply can\u2019t sell that product unless an arrangement is worked out with you.\nIf Rico likes my submission, how much money will Rico pay me for it?\nCompensation is an important component of any business deal. Value is determined through discussions between Rico and the party which controls the rights to the intellectual property and the product. Each deal is evaluated on its own merits. As a result, there is no standard amount.\nWhat type of business deal with Rico could result from my submission?\nThe type of business relationship that might result from a submission of interest to Rico could take a variety of forms, depending upon the specifics of the innovation and both the potential partner's and Rico\u2019s needs. As examples, this may take the form of a licensing, purchase or supply agreement, or other type of collaborative venture.\nFor what reasons might Rico decline to pursue my submission?\nThe proposed product idea is already known to us.\nWe already have work in progress in the area encompassed by the submission.\nThe product is not a strategic match with where we want to take our businesses or brands.\nThe size of the opportunity does not fit with our business plans.\nThere is a lack of protectable intellectual property associated with the submission.\nWhat does Rico do with personal information that I provide with my submission?\nRico uses this information to communicate with you about your submission. It is not used for any other purpose, nor is it shared with any third parties unless you have expressly indicated your agreement for us to do so.\nWe pride ourselves on attracting, developing and engaging an unconventional mix of talent that enables us to be the think different, act different, deliver different kind of agency we are today.\nAre you ready to make the difference with us?"
