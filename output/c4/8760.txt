    "text": "Second in a series. Public domain offering. I made this in Photoshop and Windows Movie Maker. Here are 8.2 seconds of stock footage, lightning. Slowed down version of the previous offering. Some extra colors added. This is not real, I used Xenofex filters to create it. But it might be fun for special effects in a video. And you can use it with no worries about copyright infringement. It's free for everyone's use. Creating these little clips is my way of thanking others who have contributed to the public domain. Sorry, but Windows Movie Maker file is all I have to create it in. Please enjoy its use and leave a review if you use it in a video. If interest is strong enough I will continue to create these little files.\nThank you Ivan. I am just winging it right now and wanted to put someting up people might be able to use. I didn't add any sound so people could add their own. I think I will get better at making clips as time goes by. I appreciate your comment.\nSubject: A very nice stock footage clip!!!\nThis is a nice stock footage lighting clip. It is silent! Good quality and a nice file size. Worth an addition to any stock footage collection. NOTE TO MR LEE: I feel this belongs in the Stock Footage section of the Internet Archive. If this interests you, please contact me at Ivantoy2@msn.com for more information, or leave a note in the Stock Footage Forum in the Archive and I will respond....Yours Truly, Ivan Bridgewater."
