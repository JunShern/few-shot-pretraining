I first found this site about 3 years ago, and the examples are great!\nThe focus is on Soviet armour and vehicles, but includes many British, Canadian, and US lend-lease vehicles. The art work is superb.\nSister site of the above, but this is newer and a work in progress. So far it mostly has lorries and cars. Includes photos as well as art work.\nThe Engines of the Wehrmacht site is excellent!"
