    "text": "What can poetry do when faced with the daily realities of war and hatred, violence and terror, the crimes that humans enact upon each other and on the Earth? A cynic would answer nothing, would condemn the personal lyric as pure solipsism, an indulgence for the privileged few. But many 21st century poets are wrestling with questions of justice, writing at the intersection of history and intimacy, weaving political and social truth-telling into their private experiences.\nRobert Pinsky defended his art while serving as poet laureate: \u201cI think poetry is a vital part of our intelligence, our ability to learn, our ability to remember, the relationship between our bodies and minds,\u201d he told the Christian Science Monitor. Bay Area poets Solmaz Sharif and Tess Taylor prove this claim, help us learn and remember with their vital new collections.\nSharif\u2019s astonishing debut Look (Graywolf Press; $16) examines an endless cycle of war and violence, using a myriad of voices and forms. A formidable poetic talent, Sharif was born in Istanbul to Iranian parents, activists who fled their home country after the Iranian Revolution.\nThe phrases in all caps are taken from the U.S. Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms, a sinister document that Sharif has studied in depth. \u201cLook\u2019s\u201d central project is to interrogate the words themselves, to reveal how the terminology of war is entrenched in our language. She cites some of the Dictionary\u2019s nearly 6,000 definitions and then remakes her own, splicing them into longer poems: \u201cPINPOINT TARGET one lit desk lamp/ and a nightgown walking past the window,\u201d \u201cDAMAGE AREA does not include night sweats/ or retching at the smell of barbeque.\u201d For the reader, these capitalized words and their visceral new meanings enact a series of small shocks, felt in the body and the mind.\nFar from the sites of violence, Bay Area native Tess Taylor chronicles a farming year in her radiant second collection, Work & Days (Red Hen Press; $11.95). Awarded the prestigious Amy Clampitt Fellowship, Taylor balances solitary poem making in \u201can old lady\u2019s cottage\u201d with intensive physical work at a local veggie farm. Taylor led youth garden programs in Berkeley and interned in the kitchen at Chez Panisse before digging into poetry, and her keen sense of place and love of food pervade these poems.\nDespite global warming, famine and flood, Taylor captures delight and seeks hope, observes \u201ca thumb-sized frog\u201d singing its \u201cshort springtime song.\u201d She celebrates the summer solstice, the apex of the year when \u201clight is monument to its own passing\u201d and turns her fine powers of description to mulching garlic, planting leeks, digging potatoes, making apple butter.\nMay those who are hungry be fed.\nMay those who have food also hunger for justice."
