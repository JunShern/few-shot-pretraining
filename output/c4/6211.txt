    "text": "I am writing this on a beautiful sunshiny day with spring around the corner, even though there is still a little chill in the air wondering if we have seen the last of the cold. That description reminds me of recent state and local races. November 6th was a sunny and warm day as we took back the governorship and kept the Senate. But the chill remained in the air when we failed to win a solid majority in the house and several key Republicans formed a coalition with mostly Democrats in charge. If we thought that looked bad it didn't compare to the complete spring storm in last week's municipal races! Elections do have consequences and we in Anchorage continue watching a once great city turn into a blue leaning homeless shelter.\nI returned last week from 3 days in Juneau. The atmosphere was definitely different than years past. Our Governor is holding firm on his campaign pledges while he finds only lukewarm responses from both sectors of the legislature. It is a very difficult time for the House which seems to be split in several different factions. Many of our first term legislators have seen a dysfunctional organization with bitter battles and long term working relationships severed. It is going to be a long session with Governor vetoes and possible overrides of those vetoes.\nI was asked by several legislators what I thought about the PFD. I told them I thought the same as I did when I voted for Governor Dunleavy in November. He very clearly stood on returning the full dividend and balancing the budget. He is a rare politician since immediately upon being elected he kept those promises with his actions. I further stated as long as rural/bush Alaska continues to get a free ride, with $100 million a year ferry subsidies, Olympic swimming pools in Sitka, PBS and Arts Council funding and millions being spent on failing schools with no accountability for results, I, like many others, want our full dividend. When we see a true cap on spending perhaps we will discuss a cap on the PFD. Right now, it is just the principal of some getting it all and the rest of us sharing the burden.\nIf you have not been involved in the past, this is a good time to start! I try to send action alerts and appreciate all that call or send emails. Legislators tell me it does matter and they want to hear from us, not special interest groups. I have to sometimes wonder about that since when running as a candidate we often hear something different than after they arrive in Juneau. Watch Channel 15 on your TV to see your legislator at work. Sign up to follow bills of interest, then call in and testify or at the least write an email. Conservatives have got to become as organized as the Democrats. Instead we seem to be better at calling into talk radio and ranting on Facebook than we do grassroots.\nYes, elections have consequences and unless apathy in the conservative community gets better, we are not going to like our consequences.\nWhew, can you believe it is already August? We are just days away from a hot primary election. Don\u2019t forget to vote on Tuesday, August 16 and take a neighbor or a friend along. We have many choices, and we want to make sure we elect strong Republicans to office!\nThat being said, words cannot express my thankfulness for your unwavering support and generosity. We are the one club in Anchorage who provided financial support for some of our uncontested races in this year\u2019s primary! That help is greatly appreciated and very much needed, and that ability is all thanks to our wonderful members and friends! KEEP UP THE HARD WORK!\nHave you reported your campaign hours? I know several of you are working hard, so please email your volunteer time to pumpvote@yahoo.com.\nThanks to all of you who attended our Summer Salad Luncheon and Cruise Event! What a fabulous time! Along those lines, please SAVE THE DATE. We are working with the Women\u2019s Clubs from around the State to host an event in the Valley prior to the SCC meeting on Friday, September 9. Our women are ready to have the \u201cPower of the Purse\u201d on full display. Tickets are $50 and will be on sale beginning tomorrow at the ARP Picnic. Our club will be working with the campaigns to put on a fashion show. Are you itching to help? Call or email Stacey, 903-3798 or sstonearwc@yahoo.com.\nThe past couple of months have been tough ones for ARWC. Two of our Board members have lost family members. Carolyn Leman lost her youngest daughter, Nicole in a terrible hiking accident in New Zealand. Kay Schuster lost her sister, Suzy in her long battle with cancer. Suzy, her mother, Maxine and sister-in-law Chelsea are all members of ARWC.\nPlease keep both of these families in your thoughts and prayers. Because of these events we have decided to delay our Lincoln Day Dinner, which is usually held in February. As soon as rescheduled we will let everyone know.\nWe do have several great events scheduled and you can read about them in this newsletter. Many of us are also involved in the Alaska Presidential Preference Poll March 1, 2016 and District meetings that will be held shortly afterward. At these district meetings delegates will be elected to the State Convention April 28-30, 2016 in Fairbanks.\nIt is important you become involved in selecting the next Republican candidate for President. If you wish to participate in this selection you must first attend the PPP (link to ARP website for PPP locations) on March 1, and to be considered a delegate to the State Convention you must attend your district convention. Many of our members serve as District and party officers and we commend you on for your service.\nARWC would like to congratulate all the members and member\u2019s family members who have stepped forward to run for office. This is a difficult decision and we are proud of each one. ARWC currently has 8 members in the AK Legislature, 2 women on the ANC Assembly and 1 woman on the school board. Please watch for postings showing how you can help all those putting their hats in the ring.\nWe are proud to announce that ARWC has the most women in office than any club in the State!"
