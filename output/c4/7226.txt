Well this is me but I\u2019ve not only just learnt stupid facts I\u2019ve also acquired some beauty ones which I actually apply to real life. I love watching and reading post all about crazy ways to hack beauty, how to do something super quick or a how to. I use a lot of these hacks in my beauty routine so I thought I would share them all with you incase you also find yourself here at 2:00 AM. Leave me some comments below if you use any of these beauty tricks or even ones I haven\u2019t mentioned.\n1. Apply foundation centre of the face and spread outwards, it avoids that cake face mask look.\n2. White liner on the waterline brightens up your eyes and makes then appear bigger.\n3. Bronze your face in a three shape. Temples, cheeks and jaw line.\n4. Sharpen lipstick with concealer touch ups.\n5. Brush lips gently with a tooth brush to remove dry skin but also make them look plumper.\n6. Make dry shampoo your best friend.\n7. If you run out of shaving cream use conditioner.\n8. Brush your hair from the bottom up to avoid pulling out hair!\n9. Fingers gone green off cheap jewellery? Just use clean nail polish and paint the inside.\n10. Keep coconut oil at arms reach! un out of makeup remover? Need a hair treatment? Cuticle help it has your back."
