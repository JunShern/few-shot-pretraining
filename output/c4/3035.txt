    "text": "Mr. Thomas Pohl works at the law office Pohl & Marx in Berlin and is specialised in criminal law. As he speaks english very well, Mr. Pohl is the right lawyer for you when being investigated and/or charged with any type of criminal offences in Berlin.\nWhen you are in the focus of the Berlin police or Staatsanwaltschaft, you need a lawyer who is not only capable to provide a high quality representation, but who also can communicate in english with you.\nKnowledge, court experience and communication are the keys for success at court, especially when facing a foreign legal system.\nMr. Pohl is an english-speaking criminal law specialist and has defended in many cases, among them high profile cases like manslaughter, drug offences, fraud cases and money-laundering.\nCriminal law in germany surely is similar to most other criminal laws in english-speaking countries, but the rules at court are very different.\nWe here at Pohl & Marx do not only know the law but also understand how stressful police investigation is, and even more so a conviction.\nThat is why we think through a variety of reasonable strategies for every case to pick, explain and recommend the best one. That is how we help you in reaching the goal: Dismiss charges or minimize penalties."
