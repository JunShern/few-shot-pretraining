    "text": "This handpicked collection of handmade March birthstone jewelry includes an assortment of earrings, necklaces, rings, and charms (and one cuff bracelet) that feature the beautiful soft blue aquamarine stone. Bloodstone is also recognized as a March birthstone. In fact, until very recently, bloodstone was the primary stone, with aquamarine the secondary. It\u2019s easy t see why the switch was made: Bloodstone jewelry is not easy to find, especially handmade jewelry. But I did manage to find and include one pair of bloodstone earrings for old-times\u2019 sake. They won\u2019t be hard for you to spot. Some of these beauties are in silver settings, some are in gold settings, and the range of prices will accommodate most shopper\u2019s budgets. Birthstone jewelry is a wonderful connection to our past. The practice of wearing gemstones to attune to their vibratory powers is ancient. And associating specific gemstones with birth months goes back over 2000 years and has evolved along several separate cultural paths. This collection of beautiful handmade birthstone jewelry is based on the familiar modern United States standard that was created in 1912 (and updated in 1952, 2002, and 2016): Garnet (January), Amethyst (February), Aquamarine, Bloodstone (March), Diamond (April), Emerald (May), Pearl, Moonstone (June), Ruby (July), Peridot (August), Sapphire (September), Opal, Pink Tourmaline (October), Citrine (November), Turquoise, Zircon, Tanzanite (December).
