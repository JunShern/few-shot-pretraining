My various books include science, poetry, verse, information, and imagination. Here are some of my books, which I wrote and a variety of wonderfully talented artists illustrated them. I have three new books: Snowman \u2013 Cold = Puddle: Spring Equations; In the Middle of the Night: Poems from a Wide Awake House; and Lion of the Sky: Haiku for All Seasons! (If you hover the cursor over a picture, it will pause it. For many of the slides, if you click on one, it will lead to more info on my site.) Feel free to explore the links in the menu above and the sidebar to the right to learn more about me and my writing life. Thanks!"
