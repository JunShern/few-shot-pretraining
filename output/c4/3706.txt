    "text": "Granite Geek: When is a drought not a drought?\nRight now in Concord, we are living in a meteorological puzzle: The National Weather Service says this is the wettest August since records began being kept 150 years ago, yet the National Weather Service also says the region is \u201cabnormally dry,\u201d the first stage of its drought-measurement scale.\nNo, climate change hasn\u2019t driven weather folks crazy. The solution to the puzzle is that there are droughts and then there are droughts.\n\u201cThere is a time lapse in how different systems respond to current conditions,\u201d is how Richard Kiah, chief of Hydrologic Network Operations for the regional office of the U.S. Geological Survey, puts it.\nIn laymen\u2019s terms: When wet weather appears, as it did in July, after a long stretch of very dry weather like we had this spring, the grass starts growing pretty quickly but it takes longer to fill up the aquifers that our wells depend on. A drought above ground might end, might even give way to flooding, while drought lingers below ground.\nThat\u2019s roughly what we\u2019re seeing now, although thankfully the drought and flooding have been minor compared to other parts of the country.\nAs of Saturday, the official rainfall total in Concord for the month of August is 9.36 inches, breaking the all-time August record of 9 inches, set in 1892. Even so, Concord and the swath of central New Hampshire from Sullivan County to Carroll County are officially \u201cabnormally dry,\u201d the first of five categories on the federal drought-measurement scale.\nThis discrepancy is a function of the \u201ctime lapse\u201d that Kiah mentioned above. As an illustration, he pointed to the town of Warner.\nUSGS maintains a series of measuring devices around the state that keep track of groundwater levels, meaning how much water is available for wells, and other devices that measure how much is flowing on the surface in rivers. Warner has a stream gauge measuring flow on the Warner River, and also a groundwater well nearby.\nAt the end of March, which is roughly when the dry spell began, the stream gauge in Warner was measuring water flow above the 95th percentile point for that time of year, meaning more water was flowing in the river than almost late March in history. The groundwater level was almost that high as well: It was in the 90th percentile.\nBy mid-July, after two months of bone-dry weather, the surface stream gauge had plunged almost to the 10th percentile, meaning that nearly nine out of 10 past Julys had seen more water in the river, definitely a drought signal. Yet at the same time, groundwater gauge was still in the \u201cnormal\u201d range, just slightly under the long-term average.\nBoth gauges are now trending upwards, and I would guess that in the next few weeks central New Hampshire will be out of the drought category entirely, as they are already in southern New Hampshire. It\u2019s not straightforward, though.\nThe designation of drought requires more than just measuring recent rainfall or water flows. Other factors intrude, notably evapotranspiration, which is the measure of how much of the moisture falling from the ground and existing in the air as humidity is used by plants.\n\u201cAt this time of year, some of the rainfall is not going to be recharging the groundwater, it\u2019s going to be taken up by the plants and trees,\u201d Kiah said. So even if a wet period is good for plants, fixing the agricultural drought, it may not be all that good for long-term water supplies.\nAll this makes determining whether we\u2019re in a drought something of an art as well as a science, balancing the needs of plants and people today with the needs of plants and people in the coming weeks and months.\n\u201cNew Hampshire\u2019s drought management plan takes into account these things,\u201d Kiah said.\nThe terminology goes from meteorological drought, due to a lack of rain, to agricultural drought, when the soil dries out, to hydrological drought, affecting groundwater and stream flows. Perhaps what should happen is that we give up on the idea of announcing whether we\u2019re in a drought and instead announce whether we\u2019re in any of three possible types of drought.\nBut probably not. That would confuse people more than enlighten them.\nAfter all, designating a drought is as much a social and political marker as a scientific marker. It gives governments authority to impose watering bans and it motivates people to save water. Even if it isn\u2019t always logically consistent, it\u2019s still useful."
