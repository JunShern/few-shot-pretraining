    "text": "What do the 12 houses in your birth chart mean? What is an Ascendant and Descendant sign? Find out here! You can get a free birthchart reading here and use the coordinates for a natal birth chart reading here.\nThe Ascendant, also known as the Rising Sign, is the start of one\u2019s horoscope birth chart. The Ascendant is the most important position of the chart and forms the cusp of the first house. The Ascendant shows your entry into this world at the time of birth. The twelfth house is the house of captivity and all things that are hidden, so it is logical that emerging from the womb (the 12th house) you ascend into this world and make your first appearance. The first house can only be determined by knowing your exact time of birth. Without the exact time of birth, the first house and the true starting point of your houses are only guesswork.\nAny planet placed within 8 degrees of the Ascendant will have a noticeable effect on the personality, characteristics and all things governed by the house in which it occupies. Aries is the sign that rules the 1st house in the natural zodiac.\nThe fourth house of your horoscope rules areas related to home, family and property. Your origins, family background, childhood, inner emotions, fixed properties, home life, the end of life are covered by this house. Mental foundations and condition are also found in the 4th house.\nOne may say that the parents with the most effect are covered by this house. Generally, the mother is found in the fourth house and the father in the tenth house. Females are ruled by the moon in your chart and the moon is the natural ruler of the fourth house, so we use the fourth house as an important factor of the mother. This house also covers the one that encourages, which is primarily the mother. Cancer is the sign that governs the 4th house in the natural zodiac.\nThe sixth house is the house of health and service. General happiness and disease are found here. Positive actions you take for your health such as diet and exercise are also found in the sixth house. Cleanliness, work (not career, as that is a tenth house substance), facility, employees, relations with employer, anyone who provides a service to you in whatever capacity, domestic pets and your daily routine are related to the 6th house. Virgo rules the 6th house in the natural zodiac.\nThe cusp of the 7th house is also known as the Descendant and is formed by the horizon line directly across from the Ascendant (1st house). It is the sign that, like the sunset, was setting in the west at the time of birth. It is found at 3 o\u2019clock on the zodiac wheel. Libra is the sign that governs the 7th house in the natural zodiac.\nNinth house is known as the house of long distance travel. Travel of distances greater than 500 miles would be found in this house. Expeditions, foreigners, foreign countries, journeys into the unknown both physical and mental, religion, divinity, philosophy, views, forecast, languages, higher education, literature, books, publishing, media, law, lawyers, fact, justice, prediction, expansion and development of one\u2019s horizons in all ways are covered by the 9th house. Sagittarius is the sign that governs the 9th house in the natural zodiac."
