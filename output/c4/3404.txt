Everyone needs to read this to understand and feel the spirit of that era. The main characters of this story go through a war - a war with society, with prejudices, with their own character. This story is about tolerance and prejudice, the story of how people can make mistakes in their judgments. Describing the world through the eyes of a little girl, the author forces to take a fresh look at many things.\nThanks to my music teacher!\nThe Students' Club is created for young people to quickly find information, share ideas, and to build a strong community.
