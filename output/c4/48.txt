Regardless of the terrible puns, we stand by what we said about fitting in but also being an individual and all that jazz. Which is exactly why we think a playing card its the perfect representational costume of the dichotomy of individualism vs. collectivist natures... and also we really like cards. Throwing them at things, building card castles with them, and playing games with them. Perhaps you have a kid like this. What? No, not a kid posing rhetorical questions about individualism, a kid who likes cards.\nIf you do have a kid like this, well then we have the perfect outfit for them. Our Kids Ace of Clubs Costume has a white, foam-backed sleeveless tunic designed to look like the ace of clubs. Attached is a black velvet hood and cowl collar, shaped to look like a club, with a zipper up the back. The neck of the hood has elastic around the front edge for a snug fit around the face, and it comes with black velvet mitts with wide cuffs and elastic at the wrists. Your kid will look fancy enough to be invited to royal croquet parties in the garden.\nOoh! You could say your kid will be \"on deck\" in this outfit!... Wait, we can do better than that. This fun outfit will have your kid ready to shuffle!... Alright, we're done now. Promise."
