    "text": "An important lesson for all digital advertisers is: Being viewable does not equal being seen.\nTime spent with your ad will increase with size, but only if placed in \u201dcalm\u201d environments.\nWhere to place Display ads and call-to-actions? People\u2019s visual attention is (still) focuesd in upper left corners.\nThere is a major See vs Say gap in survey results. Imagine case 1 of a survey outcome where 21% answers yes to remembering an ad, and 71% says they \u201dsaw\u201d the ad. In the second case, 40% answered that they remembered the ad, but only 21% says they saw it.\nIn case 1 you will undervalue the number of contacts for the ad.\nIn case 2 you will overvalue the number of contacts for the ad.\nIf you find that 98% of purchases are 1-click-to-conversion then attribution modeling is not for you.\nCredit your Display impressions based in the proximity to website visit. You might experience longer purchase cycles than you think.\nIn multi-channel funnels report, use conversion segments. For example look at conversion likelihood paths: segment on \u201dpurchasers\u201d separately to be able to draw the right conclusions.\nSteer clear of vanity metrics. Conversion rate is one of them! Conversion rate of total visits could just as well be a sign of how much research your customers are doing before completing a purchase. (tips: separate conversion rate and cart abandonment rate).\nMove marketing budgets to optimisation budget.\nThink product conversion rates, and not total visitor conversion rate. Do you have a visibility issue, an availability issue (out of stock?) or a conversion rate issue (in the payment step)?\nWork with propensity segmentation (k\u00f6pintention, som jag skrev om i m\u00e5ndags!) the customer\u2019s intention and inclination to purchase from you is reflected in their behavior and movements on the website.\nDesign should not be pretty, it should be useful.\nCreate an internal competition based on a good, visible and measureable metric.\nHave at least one hackathon a year.\nLearn all there is to know about Hummingbird.\nHarness the 1:9:90. (1% contribute, 9% comment and 90% just observe) by creating email lists based on the three segments. A way of determining who to put in which segment is by doing an email sendout where you encourage recipients to like, comment or contribute. Then you track and collect the email addresses for the respective actions.\nAre you stealing share or are you growing the pond? Successful companies are those who don\u2019t just defend their market share towards competition, they embrace innovation and creativity to grow the arena in which they can operate.\nThere is a very high correlation between traffic acquisition and onsite experience and conversion. Is your organisation built to facilitate exchange and collaboration between the two disciplines?"
