    "text": "Barbara McArthur \"writer/editor\" - A fabulous bat!\nI had to wait until I could visit a batting cage with my 17 year-old grandson to come up with a decent review of the bat. It LOOKS lethal - or very cool. From what I experienced, and it's been a while since I've been in a batthing cage with a bat in my hand, the bat is everything they say it is - well-balanced, with the ability to flex - and the distance and speed are surely greater than I've ever accomplished with a wooden bat. My grandson echoes what I have said - and he can't wait for the snow to disappear so he can used it on the baseball team this spring. It's a real beauty in all respects!\nAfter trying many other products, Exposed Acne System has worked best! The system is easy to use and very effective. For any of you that have seen a dermotoglist, you will notice the same products recommended by your doctor are in Exposed products. I am so thankful I found this company and their products. You will be too."
