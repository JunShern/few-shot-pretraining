    "text": "Today\u2019s blogger is Amy Norton, our behind-the-scenes editor. If word choice were an Olympic sport, she\u2019d get the gold. Thanks to Amy for writing today\u2019s post on the newest fashion destination in Nashville: Anthropologie Shoes and Accessories.\nWhat is it about spending a little time in Anthropologie that seems to soothe the soul? Mine, anyway. Whenever I need a pick-me-up (i.e. Winter 2011 \u2013 all of it), a quick spin through this favorite haunt always seems to lift my spirits. Doesn\u2019t matter if I leave with the smallest of trinkets \u2013maybe a candle or new pair of earrings\u2013 or an entire outfit purchased in anticipation of a new season. Although I might skulk in as Madame Frump, I always skip out feeling a little bit new again. And discovering a different way to reframe myself makes me happy to contemplate the contents of my closet again.\nHaving just attended the grand opening of Anthropologie\u2019s Shoes and Accessories Boutique in the Mall at Green Hills last week, I\u2019m thrilled to know that all of my discretionary spending will now be trackable to one place. (Who needs groceries anyway, right?) Since I was a child, I\u2019ve had a fetish for accessories, and Anthro\u2019s newest store is brimming with amazing adornments from all around the world (not to mention our own back yard) in the form of jewelry, handbags, scarves, belts and shoes. Anything you need to elevate your standard issue jeans-and tee from \u201cwah\u201d to \u201cwow\u201d can be found here. Just take a seat on the emerald green velvet divan in the shoe gallery and soak up the visual feast of all the baubles around you and you\u2019ll see what I mean.\nVintage sunglasses. Never worn, discovered in a warehouse by an enterprising buyer.\nHow about a little old fashioned needlepoint as a case for your iPhone? Love it. Whimsy and design courtesy of Virginia Johnson.\nWhether it\u2019s vintage jewelry or custom handbags designed exclusively for the company, Katherine\u2019s buyers literally travel the globe in search of the treasures they know their customers want. Says Katherine, \u201cFrom Nepal to Ecuador, we find artisans in the craziest places creating amazing things\u2026and the cohesive nature of our collection comes from knowing our clientele and buying for their particular aesthetic.\u201d Note: 20% of the merchandise in the Nashville store is unique to this city, and 50% is unique to Anthropologie. So if you\u2019ve ever wondered how a chain retailer can have stores dotted across the globe and feel different in each locale, now you know why.\nA Case Study in Vintage Jewelry You\u2019ll Only Find in Nashville. Reminds me of things I have from my grandmother\u2019s jewelry box, only better. No pinchy clip-on earrings.\nAnthropologie Accessories offers jewelry lines from six local designers, one of whom is Kari Beth, pictured here by a display of her vintage jewelry. And if she looks familiar, that may be because you\u2019ve shopped with her at the Anthro store in the Hill Center. Worlds collide!\nCompany-wide, from the designers, to the buyers to the sales associates, Anthropologie focuses on making the impossible find possible and offers endless and as-yet unimagined possibilities for creative self-expression. Sounds more like an art gallery than a retail chain, right? Precisely.\nInsider Shopping Tip: We\u2019re told to always ask if there\u2019s stock in the back not out on display. Anthropologie constantly receives new merchandise. All you have to do is ask what\u2019s new.\nDon\u2019t miss the StyleBlueprint huge $1,500 giveaway this week featuring Jamie, AshBlue, Judith Bright and H. Audrey as we celebrate Lexus Nashville Fashion Week. For details, click here."
