For example date and some others.\nI would like to have my own lifecycle so that records in a category would move from phase to another when some event occurs. Those events would be tied to certain phase of time or some other.\nAlfresco being open source I know this is possible but could someone point me a direction how I could make those customizations. How difficult would it be? Would it need some java programming or could I do it using web scripts or customizing xml-files?"
