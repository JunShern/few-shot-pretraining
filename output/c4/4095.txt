    "text": "Welcome, Pretties, to another installment of My Book Boyfriend, hosted by the wonderful Missie from The Unread Reader.\nDue to the return of our monthly group reads, we have for you Pretty Readers today another fine example of why book boys are just plain better, and that example comes in the form of a Dauntless boy named Four.\n* He only has four fears: He's acrophobic, claustrophobic, afraid to have to kill some one, and afraid of his father.\nJesse: I admit, I read Divergent almost a year ago, so it's a little fuzzy in my mind, but I do remember that Four is one of my favorite male characters in a dystopian novel. Ever.\nHe is sweet, strong, and honorable. But he has his weaknesses just like everyone else. I fell head over heels in love with him during a scene where he's running a paintball war game. The main character, Tris, climbs up to the top of a broken down ferris wheel to find the enemy team's location. And Four, even though he's deathly afraid of heights, follows her up to the top. That's just the kind of guy he is. He'll put the needs and wants of the people he cares about before his own.\nKira: In all honesty, there are a LOT of things I love about Four. Actually, I don't think there is anything I don't love about him. That said, there were a few major selling points when it comes to my love for Four.\nFirst -- and it seems like every week I seem to be pointing out characteristics that I am a sucker for, but this is one of my absolute top -- I am a major sucker for honorable characters, and Four has honor in spades. Four, to me, represents what a dauntless should be. He's not unjust, he's not unnecessarily ruthless like some some of his peers, and he tries to live up to what Dauntless was meant to be.\nI also love that he's so sweet (though Tris doesn't seem to agree with me) and kind of a little broken (and yet he's still ten times better than half the other Dauntless).\n\"'And your side?' he asks, his voice low.\n\"'You know, most boys would enjoy being trapped in close quarters with a girl.' I roll my eyes.\nSo, Pretties, which book boy(s) do you want to find wrapped up with a pretty little bow this holiday season?\nI loved Four! You picked some amazing quotes that showcase all the reasons he is amazing. Love the pics as well. Great choice this week!\nI LOVE FOUR! He is so hot and unique! You picked out some of my favorite quotes! I love when he tells her I think I love you but I'm waiting to tell you when I'm sure. Great pics too. I wouldn't have thought of Max Irons but he does fit well.\nwoah, we have the same book boyfriend for this week =D but I pick another person for this.\nLove, love, love Max Irons - will read ANY book with a character that looks remotely like him! But I've heard nothing but good things about Four, I must get to this book sooooon!\nI've sooo got to read this book! I love, love, love the highlights in your post. I think I love him already!\nThis makes me want to reread the book!\nThis is one of my favs and I cannot wait for Insurgent to come out!\nGreat job picking out Four in all his hotness! Smoochin' the screen!\nSeriously? He's 18 not 19.\nI know you did this a good while ago. But I've only just seen it....and I've only just finished reading Divergent...so I am totally swooning right now. Awesome post!"
