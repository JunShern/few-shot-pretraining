This gift guide has picked the best for all ages.\nI don\u2019t know a single kid who doesn\u2019t love building, inventing, and creating on some level. If I had my way, the only presents my kids would ever get would either be STEM-related, science-related, or engineering related. These kids engineering gifts are for girls and boys who love building, creating, and making things work. What I love most about the gifts on this list is that most of them are presented in kit form, which makes them much easier to store (and wrap).\nIf your child has an interest in building and engineering, foster their love with these amazing kids engineering kit ideas.\nRelated: Simple STEM Activities to Try Today!\nKiwi Crate is one of my favorite subscription boxes. There are varying age levels for preschool through middle school (we\u2019re pretty fond of the Tinker Crate) and all of the projects are so creative and fun!\nWe were sent the first box of Creation Crate by the company to try a few months ago and Monkey had a blast building her mood lamp and programming everything. This particular crate is best for middle school to high school kids, so I ended up having to help Monkey do some of the programming, but when the lights lit up on her lamp, you could see the pride in her eyes. She loved being able to program and make her very own lamp from start to finish.\nGo old-school with this wood building kit.\nWhen I was a child, it was my dream to build fabulous creations with K\u2019Nex. But mainly I just built spaceships for my stuffed animals.\nThis circuit/programming kitworks with the same program that Creation Crate does (Arduino). I was impressed by the simplicity of the design, but it also had room for so much creativity and advancement once a child progresses beyond basic programming. I see this as the perfect gift for middle school or high school tinkerers.\nMonkey would really love this buildable/programmable bug robot.\nYou can make all kinds of things with this little inventor\u2019s kit!\nThis invention kit is perfect for preschool engineers.\nKids can build all kinds of things with the Hanz invention kit!\nLearn about circuits safely with this kit.\nI love the bright colors in this engineering kit for younger kids.\nKids can learn how to design a car with this kit!"
