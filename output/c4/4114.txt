Excited as ever!\nStill, I cannot understand AirAsiaX\u2019s decision to eventually cancel it\u2019s KUL-DEL route in April 2012. The flight was almost full! Yes, the airport tax increase means extra burden for passengers but the thing is it applies to all other airlines as well. AirAsia will still be much cheaper compared to full service airlines.\nEnjoyed the first flight hour reading Travel 3Sixty.\nFilled in the India Arrival Card for foreigners.\nSleeping like a baby in its mother\u2019s womb.\nHad Airasia\u2019s chicken butter rice for brunch. Delicious!\nNot long after, Vivian had her chicken briyani. Delicious!\nTurned the clock back 2\u00bd hours as India was +5\u00bd GMT while Malaysia was +8 GMT.\n*All times after this is in IST.\nWe knew we were in Delhi when we saw the fog that Delhi\u2019s winter is famous for.\n01.12 pm \u2013 Arrived at New Delhi, India and was surprised to find Indira Gandhi International Airport to be so clean and modern.\nThe giant symbolic hand gestures at immigration called mudras, commonly found in Buddhism, Hinduism and yoga greeting arriving passengers. And though almost all counters were open, the crowd lining up was HUGE. My guess is several planes arrived at almost the same time.\n01.32 pm \u2013 Collected our luggage from the belt.\nThe terminal was so modern and clean. What a sparkling first impression it gave us!\n01.44 pm \u2013 Made our way towards the Airport Metro Express.\nBought ourselves a one way ticket from the airport to New Delhi Railway Station for INR 80 which I think is pretty cheap compared to Malaysia\u2019s KLIA Express for MYR 35.\nEverything to this point still looked bright, clean and modern.\n02.09 pm \u2013 Inside the coach that looks pretty much like KLIA Express\u2019s.\nThe scenery along the 20 minute journey consisted mostly of roads.\n02.34 pm \u2013 Exiting the New Delhi Railway Airport Express station.\nAt the entrance of New Delhi Railway Station.\nAh, this was the point where our bubble burst. India smelled like what India was supposed to smell like. Porters coming up to you asking to carry your bags for a fee. Pair of eyes everywhere staring at you. Hordes of people everywhere.\n02.59 pm \u2013 Left New Delhi Railway in search of Paharganj where our temporary hotel was supposed to be at. Lost our way for about 10 minutes while being constantly followed by tuk tuk drivers persuading us to take a ride with them.\nIt wasn\u2019t long before we found the backpacker haven of Paharganj.\n03.26 pm \u2013 There were so many tiny, narrow lanes all over Paharganj that it was so difficult for us to find New King DX Hotel. When I arrived, the entrance to the hotel gave Vivian and I such an uneasy feeling. I booked a room at New King because it had one of the cheapest double rooms in Delhi and I only needed to use it for a nap and a shower.\nWhen we arrived we were told that there were renovations going on in the dorm room so our double bed was given to others. We were upgraded to another hotel within the vicinity under the same ownership.\n03.48 pm \u2013 New Hindustan DX.\nThe business card to get us back to the hotel in case we needed to use a taxi.\n04.38 pm \u2013 Found Malhotra Restaurant from the excellent online Indian restaurant directory called Zomato.\nOrdered vegetables, chicken, eggs and naan.\nOur first meal tasted real good.\nGot myself a Vodafone prepaid sim. I was actually curious as to what food/drink people were queuing for outside of Bhalla Cafe but didn\u2019t pursue it any further as I wanted to stick to the golden rule for avoiding diarrhea in India. No street food no matter what.\n06.03 pm \u2013 Arrived back to our hotel for a few hours worth of rest.\n08.16 pm \u2013 After a warm shower, we packed up and got ready to leave for Jodhpur.\n08.32 pm \u2013 Found ourselves a tuktuk to bring us to the train station.\n09.06 pm \u2013 Sarai Rohilla Railway Station, one of 6 railway stations in Delhi, where our train was scheduled to depart.\nFound ourselves in an eating place located along the narrow lanes opposite the train station.\nAs we did months of homework before coming to India, ordering in a non-English speaking environment was much easier.\nJeera rice, an Indian dish consisting of rice and cumin seeds.\nThe vegetarian rice was actually tastier and more nutritious.\n09.55 pm \u2013 Locating our coach and berth took quite an effort. We could see other confused foreigners trying to find theirs as well. Lol.\nFinally, about 10 minutes later, we were aboard our coach.\nVivian took the upper bunk while I took the lower bunk. I slept for a whole 8 hours out of the 10 hours we were on the tracks. I think the continuous motion of the train coupled with the white noise of the wheels made sleeping a little more comfortable although every time I took an overnight train, there were loud snorers around.\nHonestly, I found the toilets in class AC2 of Rajasthan S Krant, our train name, to be really clean! It looked cramp but smelled alright."
