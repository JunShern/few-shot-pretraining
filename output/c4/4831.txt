    "text": "The Buzz: Palomar clearing land off Hilltop Drive. Here's why.\nThe Buzz: A piece of land off Hilltop Drive is getting cleared. Here's why.\nDirt, and lots of it, has been moving on a piece of hillside property off Mission De Oro Drive across from the Shasta Creek Apartments east of Interstate 5.\nThe work is visible from off north Hilltop Drive.\nPalomar Builders is grading land to build attached homes, much like its Park Pointe neighborhood just north of this site.\nBut this project has a twist.\nJeb Allen, Palomar\u2019s co-owner, told me about 10 of the 46 units will have studio apartments where the garage would go. The apartments will have a bathroom and kitchen.\nAllen had tried to sell the property. But it's zoned multi-family, so Allen said nobody would buy it because the cost to build apartments didn't pencil out.\nSo, he came up with the studio apartment idea, which satisfies the requirement to build multi-family housing.\n\u201cWhen I start something, I want to finish it, and to me this finishes Highland Park,\u201d Allen said.\nHighland Park is the single-family subdivision next to Park Pointe that Palomar Builders started in 2009. Park Pointe is an extension of Highland Park.\nAllen said floorplans for his new development will range from 1,693 square feet to 2,021 square feet. The smallest floor plan will feature the 10 studio apartments.\nBut while Allen is satisfying the multi-family zoning requirement, the studio space doesn\u2019t have to be an apartment.\nThe owner could turn it into say a man cave or she shack.\nAllen hopes to start construction in the spring.\nLily Toy, the city\u2019s interim planning manager, said accessory units to homes are built throughout the city.\n\u201cBut as far building these all out as far as a planned development, yes this is probably a first,\u201d Toy said.\nIf you\u2019ve ever had an idea on how to make Redding a more desirable place to live and believe there are ways to attract more visitors to the area, the Redding City Identity Project wants to hear from you.\nThe project has posted a survey (https://bit.ly/2yKDi7n) of 16 questions that it will use to come up with 20 ideas by 2020.\nWhat challenges does Redding face?\nWhat are the three best assets of the city?\nWhat would you do within the next 10 years to affect positive change in Redding?\nYou have until Nov. 20 to take the survey and the results will be revealed Jan. 10 at the Cascade Theatre. The evening also will feature John O\u2019Leary, who was badly burned when he was 9 years old and is now an inspirational speaker and author of the book, \u201cOn Fire.\u201d O\u2019Leary is the father of four and lives in St. Louis.\nThe chamber announced its $500,000 city pride plan last spring. It has partnered with other businesses and organizations to help fund the project, including the McConnell Foundation, Sierra Pacific Industries Foundation, Dignity Health, Black Bear Diner, Commerce Home Mortgage, Compass and Josh Barker of ReMax Town & Country.\nQuestions on the survey were based in part from meetings with artists, web designers, the startup business community, and city and Shasta County leaders.\n\u201cThis is not going to be the chamber of commerce version of the identity of Redding. This is coming from the people of the community, so we want it to be a far and wide reach,\u201d Mangas said.\nIdeas to improve Redding should focus on messaging, experiences and aesthetics.\n\u201cMaybe one idea is a fa\u00e7ade improvement in Redding and maybe funding from the identity project gets leveraged with other dollars to make it happen,\u201d Mangas said.\nThere were 500 responses about a day after the survey first went up.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really fun to see how people have engaged for us,\u201d Mangas said.\nThree months after its transmitter atop Shasta Bally was destroyed by the Carr Fire, 88.9 FM KFPR in Redding is still off the air.\nAnd North State Public Radio management does not know when the transmitter will be replaced so 88.9 can be back on the air.\nMeanwhile, North State Public Radio restored full power to its 91.7 KCHO station in Chico. The station once again can be heard between Yuba City and Redding, though reception in Redding can be spotty depending on where you\u2019re at.\nKCHO had been broadcasting at reduced strength on a backup transmitter since April, when the transmitter on Cohasset overheated and failed due to a faulty air conditioning unit."
