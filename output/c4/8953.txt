Live your life to the fullest potential.\nMy motto in life has always been to try and pay attention to details no matter what \u2014 those small things that make life worth living. Why?\nThese days, our lives have become so chaotic. We run from one place to another trying to make deadlines, to be more efficient at work, more productive in life, to make more money, more \u201cfriends\u201d, more children\u2026. and the result is that more and more people in the world are reporting how UNHAPPY they are with this life because the quality of the life they are leading is not good enough.\nAmassing riches while losing the life\u2019s compass is not the way to live. So next time you are running to that meeting, stop and sit down for a moment and take in the world around you. Admire its simplicity and beauty. Breathe in the energy around and be grateful that you are able to witness that very moment in time. Give passing stranger a kind smile, hold the door for someone because you noticed that they were carrying too many bags and breathe out. Our life is happening NOW. Not in 15 minutes. Not tomorrow. Now.\n4 days ago by _marija.ristic_ My sister - my world \u2764\ufe0f . . . ."
