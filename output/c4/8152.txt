This year had over 3,600 attendees, over 1,000 investors and over 400 company presentations. Panels and other meetings at the conference also provide the opportunity to hear from experts about the state of the biotech industry.\nIf you missed the festivities down in San Francisco, we\u2019re here to fill you in with news from CEOs and experts in the industry on what the future holds for the biotech industry.\nBockman told INN he started the panel on a less than positive sentiment, from grasping the issues the immunotherapy industry has had, and where it was expected to be right now \u2014 \u201cparticularly combination\u201d studies, he said. But, there has been \u201ctremendous clinical success\u201d from the checkpoint inhibitors with chemo, and \u201ckey combination approvals such as Anti-PD-1 agent with an Anti-CTLA-4.\u201d Watch the video or check out the article for more information on Bockman\u2019s take on the industry.\nIn the interview, Raza Bokhari, FSD\u2019s executive co-chairman, explained the company is known for building the largest indoor hydroponic grow facility for medicinal cannabis. Projected top line revenue for 2019 should be over C$20 million and over C$75 million in 2020 for cannabis.\nIn May 2018, when the company went public, it raised C$53 million in funds and funneled it back into \u201cstrategic investments,\u201d Bokhari said. Part of the investments were with SciCann Therapeutics, based in Israel, and has a network of researchers, academic institutions and medical centers. The company also has clinical trials for cannabinoids in the gastrointestinal tract, in both irritable bowel syndrome and ulcerative colitis. Other indications in development could be the cardiovascular system. This partnership also allows FSD to utilize SciCann\u2019s cannabinoid scientific research platform.\nTenax Therapeutics (NASDAQ:TENX) is ready to begin enrolling patients in its pulmonary hypertension clinical trial. Anthony DiTonno, CEO of Tenax, told the Investing News Network about the company\u2019s ongoing trial, the drug and financing. DiTonno said the drug was developed by Orion Pharma in Finland, but is not available in the US. There is also no approved therapy for the indication. Tenax will enroll patients in the Phase 2 trial for pulmonary hypertension this quarter.\nDeveloping this drug began with how the company discovered the modality of pro enzymes. The enzymes have significant direct effects on cancer stem cells, which take on the traits of a stem cell and become \u201cmotile and invasive,\u201d he said. This process is why standard therapies don\u2019t always work and the cancer returns, Nathanielsz added.\nCuris\u2019 (NASDAQ:CRIS) CEO James Dentzer said 2019 will be the year of multiple data readouts for all three of its drug candidates in the clinic. Dentzer told the Investing News Network the company will present the data at a medical conference, if it\u2019s convenient. Otherwise a top-line data release will be Curis\u2019 next option to share the news with investors. Later, investigators on the trial would follow up with more data at a medical conference.\nThe company\u2019s three drugs in the clinic are fimepinostat, CA-107 and CA-4948. The first targets a gene called MYC, which Dentzer said which helps cancer cell grow, really fast. \u201cWe knock that down, both gene and protein to keep the cancer under control,\u201d he noted. Fimepinostat has US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) fast track designation.\nIn the interview above, Dr. Ralph Kern, chief medical and chief operating officer at Brainstorm, explains that his company\u2019s technology, NurOwn, takes patients\u2019 autologous stem cells and converts them into differentiated cells. The cells are then returned to the patient to \u201crepair and regenerate the nervous system,\u201d he said. The process involves a short procedure to derive the cells from the bone marrow of patients, called a bone marrow aspiration.\nThe company\u2019s lead program for ALS, in Phase 3 development, is its fourth trial for the program. Taking place at six sites in the US, 200 patients will be enrolled with half currently enrolled. The company expects to finish enrollment by the middle of 2019, and top line data should be released in mid-2020.\nWith GDC-0084, a drug from Genentech developed specifically for the disease, Garner believes his company has what it takes to fight this unique brain cancer. Last year, the company received Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA. This is one of two programs in Kazia\u2019s pipeline, with the other being for ovarian cancer. This second drug was developed in collaboration with Yale University and via Australian research. It works on addressing the resistance and recurrence paradigm of the cancer, where other ovarian cancer drugs fall short.\nEditorial Disclosure: FSD Pharma is a client of the Investing News Network.
