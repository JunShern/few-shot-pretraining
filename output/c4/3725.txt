Everything was great - the work, the price and of course the result. I highly recommend Avrodent!\nI highly recommend this clinic for all sorts of dental treatment.\nThis is my second visit. I highly recommend this clinic for all sorts of dental treatment. The atmoshpere is wonderful, staff are friendly and the doctors are experienced and very helpful. I live in Belgium but I prefer to have treatment here in Turkey because I feel safe and secure.\nReally happy with everything, apart from it being \u00a3800 more than quoted. I know it depends on the individual person but perhaps quote a bit more just to be safe.\nReally happy with everything, apart from it being \u00a3800 more than quoted. I know it depends on the individual person but perhaps quote a bit more just to be safe. Apart from that and a little miss communication about time and pick up etc. I would recommend to a friend and happy I choose qunomedical. Just as I said before, quoted 800 less than what I had to pay.\nI cannot recommend you & your clinic enough and already have friends & family booking for treatment at your clinic.\nI felt like I was in safe hands throughout the entire experiance. It is daunting experiance and my first time doing anything like this. I really can\u2019t stop smiling now my teeth are perfect!\nWe were picked up at the airport and had the same driver throughout our whole trip and he was lovely. We quickly formed a friendship and had a hug and selfies before we said goodbye. Hurriyet at Dentaglobe also looked after me throughout and was so friendly and professional. She is a perfect ambassador for the company. Every dentist I dealt with was so friendly and knowledgeable and made sure I was comfortable at all times throughout some gruelling treatment. The hotel was clean and modern (the beds are HUGE..we joked we could rent out the part of it it was so big for my husband and I)and we enjoyed exploring the City on the days I didn\u2019t have treatment. Julie at Qunomedical was fantastic in arranging everything before I went and answering any questions I had and staying in touch regularly. All in all I could not fault the process from beginning to end. I felt like I was in safe hands throughout the entire experiance. It is daunting experiance and my first time doing anything like this. I really can\u2019t stop smiling now my teeth are perfect! The only thing I could think of would be a little bit more reassurance before we set off in terms of who would be meeting us and what would happen although everything went exactly to plan. I was just a little worried there would be no one there at the airport but there was!\nAlles war sauber und freundlich.\nEverything was clean and friendly.\nThey delivered the best care at an affordable price and they made me feel safe.\nWhat an amazing experience! From the driver, to the tranlastor, to the dentist, etc.. everyone showed that they genuinely care. They delivered the best care at an affordable price and they made me feel safe. Surely, Turkey is magnificent! I like the honesty and sincerity of the individuals from the clinic.\nVery friendly staff and the finish on my new teeth are just stunning.\nFrom start to finish the service and works where impeccable. Very friendly staff and the finish on my new teeth are just stunning. I have had them for many months now with only a minor problem on return to the UK, this was very quickly resolved at a Bupa dentist. Thank you so much.\nFind below the most frequently asked questions on veneers and information about Qunomedical.\nIf you have experienced discolouration or tooth damage and want to improve the appearance of your teeth, dental veneers could be the right option. For example, they are ideal for people who have smoked or drunk coffee for a long period of time, or who have suffered discolouration due to water fluoridation. But veneers are not suitable for those with gum disease or other dental conditions.\nHow do I choose which type of veneers is right for me?\nThe best way to choose the right veneer treatment is to arrange a consultation with a skilled dentist in your area. Only a dental professional will be able to examine your teeth and gums, and assess whether you are a suitable candidate for veneers. They will also be able to recommend composite or porcelain veneers and talk you through the installation process.\nIf the process is carried out properly, dental veneer installation should be painless. Anaesthetics can be used to numb the area being treated, ensuring that the application of veneers is pain-free. However, in the gap between enamel removal and veneer application, teeth can become more sensitive to cold and heat, which can be uncomfortable for the patient.\nWhat is gum contouring and when is it needed?\nGum contouring is a process involving the use of lasers to trim gum tissue, making it appear more harmonious with the patient's teeth. It is generally used in cases where the patient's gums cover too much of their teeth, making them appear smaller than they actually are. The process usually requires a local anaesthetic and can be completed on 20-30 minutes in most cases."
