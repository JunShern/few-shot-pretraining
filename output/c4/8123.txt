What's all this, then?\nA: I'm taking old character-based board games from TV shows, Movies, and Comic Books and coding browser-playable versions of them.\nA: I enjoyed the process so much, I followed up The Six Million Dollar Man Board Game with the Bionic Crisis Board Game. I enjoyed that so much that I checked my closet for other potential board game fodder and found The Mad Magazine Board Game. That became my third project.\nA: As The Mad Magazine Game unfolded before me, I realized I wasn't going to want to stop there, but I didn't have an outlet to post the Mad game, let alone any other games. Thus, this site was born.\nA: And...and that's about it.\nQ: Thank you for answering our probing questions.\nA: You're welcome, enjoy the site."
