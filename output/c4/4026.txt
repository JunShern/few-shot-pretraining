    "text": "Black Charisma Chemical Cape is rated 3.8 out of 5 by 9.\nThe Olivia Garden Charisma Chemical Cape is innovative, waterproof, and stain proof. The ideal cape for all salon services. A perfect fit hook neck closure fits all sizes, perfectly, easily, and comfortably. Washer and dryer safe with no ironing required.\nWash and wear fabric is machine and dryer safe.\nRated 5 out of 5 by Marikuss from Great full coverage chemical cape. Works great for chemical process tasks. I used the cape for hair dying.\nRated 1 out of 5 by Perry in TX from don't wash the capes and they may be alright. We wash and sanitize our capes after each use. I have other Betty Dain capes that have withstood this treatment for a few years. These capes did not last 3 months and they look terrible!\nRated 1 out of 5 by SalonScp from Don't waste your money. We bought this cape. Visibly it looked great. We put it through the washer to use for its first use and the seems along the edge came off in spots. The material looks good. I just think they need to do a better job with the trimming.\nRated 5 out of 5 by LadyCosmo from One of my best purchases ever I baught 2 of these because they were on clearance at the time, and now I wish I had gotten more. They fit every client I have used them on, from child to large adult. The neck closure with the two hook/clasps is genius. There is no velcro to to get covered with towel fuzz and hair and they don't fall apart at the seem around the collar like most of my others. The fit is also very snug without choking your poor client, that you almost don't even need a towel under the collar. Very, very, very happy with this cape. I will definately be purchasing more.\nIs the neck on the Charisma cape elasticized??\nActually, yes it is! I just bought 8 of them!!! They are awesome!!!"
