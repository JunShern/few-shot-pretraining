    "text": "August 24, 2010. 100-minute dharma talk given by Thich Nhat Hanh in Upper Hamlet, Plum Village, Dharma Cloud Temple. The talk occurs during the Retreat for Young People with the theme Truly Alive.\nThay feels alive to me when he begins by saying this is \u201cdharma talk a la carte\u201d and that he\u2019ll invite about ten questions to get them started. He writes the questions on the white board and after about 20-minutes of audience questions, there are significantly more than ten questions. Our Teacher seems to enjoy hearing the questions as he continues to write on the board.\nAfter the bell, we are reminded that all the questions appear to be linked together and if we answer one question then we can answer all the questions. The remain hour is spent hearing about peace, understanding, and compassion. The premise of this discussion is that even if we do get what we need, we still suffer. Examples of this are everywhere.\nThe question is how can I understand my own suffering. It is the art of listening. You have to train \u2013 to practice mindful living \u2013 so you can listen to the suffering in yourself. Intention is not good enough.\nJuly 4, 2010. 68-minute dharma talk given by Thich Nhat Hanh in New Hamlet, Plum Village, Full Moon Meditation Hall. The talk was given Vietnamese and is translated into English by Sr. Chan Khong. This is the third in a series on this sutra (Part I, Part II). Sutra Commentary is based on the Chinese Dhammapada, Sutra 36. In this talk we cover lines eight through twelve. The talk was given just before the Summer Opening was to begin and Thay was unable to complete his commentary on the sutra. It is possible that it will be continued in the fall or winter.\nTo Enjoy the Ultimate. Touching nirvana.\nA special video dharma talk given in London, England on August 11, 2010. Thay teaches about the Noble Eightfold Path, and offers a session of questions and answers."
