    "text": "Fantastic clip RD!!! Enjoyed that immensely. As a Brit I think it's fair to say that Lomu has given us our fair share of heartache but no hard feelings eh? What a player, what a guy. A true hero of the sport. Can't wait for part 2! It would be interesting to see if anyone ever managed to put in a decent tackle on this guy - seems like it would be impossible.\nyeah awesome video... its amazing to hear how big he was as a 14 year old... hearing that he was probably as big as most normal rugby players at the age of 10! what a beast.. and a fantastic player.\ndamn, i'm getting goose bumps throughout the whole video!\ndid he ever score against sa?\nlike other guy had said in other comment I would really enjoy to see jonah lomu receiving a big hit!!although i suppose that was impossible!!\nOne of the best ever tackles I saw on him was in the 95 WC final by Japie Mulder. Took him around the thighs and hit him into touch. There was also one in the same game by Os du Randt and Joost van der Westhuizen. Brought him down very quick.\nAwesome clip. What a legend of the game. Changed the sport forever.\nnice clip RD!! BRILLIANT infact.\nthe swiss ball balance excercise he does is pretty impressive but most top athletes will be able to do that. i saw tennis player andrew murray doing something similar. it's tough but not that tough.\nI just want to thank you, RD, for yet another wonderful clip. This clip is very inspirational.\nThanks again. Keep it up !!\nThat was a very enjoyable video, and I'm very much looking forward to the second part. My favourite tackle on Lomu has to be George Gregan in 2000. Jonah weighed 118 Kg and GG weighed 76 Kg, pulled him down one on one on the sideline, got up and stripped the ball. Inspirational stuff.\nI was fascinated by the whole swiss ball training.\nI first heard that Annika Sorenstam can do the same (with shoes and barefoot), and was amazed.\nIt's one thing for a golfer to be able to do that -- coordination and body control are paramount.\nHowever, it's totally another to see a guy with the size and strength of Lomu to be able to do the same.\nWould be great if US television brought back some of their old 1970s, \"Battle of the Stars\", where they would have athletes from different disciplines compete against each other. I'd love to see Lomu in something like that.\nJesus, I would hate to be a winger or fullback going up against a beast like Lomu. When there's nearly no way to stop the man, that's pretty mentally defeating.\nThat being said, I could watch this video all day. I'd feel a little bad for the backs sent to bring him down, but the man is simply amazing.\nRD- Great video, documentary's on the legends are always awesome to watch.\nI worship Lomu like a god and this just made my day, thanks so much RD.\nSo watching this made me think....is there a winger in the past or present that is as good a Lomu?????????\nthere are no wingers that combine jonahs talents full stop. alesana tuilagi is a big guy, but hes not quick and agile, it takes him ages to get going and he doesnt see the space as well as lomu. caucau could be considered, as he is pretty beefy and fast as well, although he relys on his speed rather than strength, plus hes not actually super strong hes just a freak. so ye caucau is the only play who is similar in that he can go through or run round you, but id say jonah is the king!\nLOL great vid ....but i found it qite funny when the old guys tummy started to rumble at 4:02...and yes he is a bloody monster!...especially at 14!\nHabana scored as many as Jonah in the RWC...still tho with Jonah on the field people were just so much more aware of his presence. An absolute machine. True Legend, thanks RD alot!\nthe thing about comparing Cau Cau with Jonah is that Cau Cau never really lived up to his expectations, don't get me worng he's one of the best. But when u look at the fact he's been banned form internation duty for smoking weed, he goes down in my estimations. Jonah all the way.\nis the second part of this documentary about what happend to the rest of his career? i dont know too much about it, i know he neeeded a kidney replacement, thats about it.\nprob my fav clip now is there anyway chance of getting inside the lions den?\nAs a french, i haven't see much documentary about big Jonah, so keep it coming guys !\nI heard his wife was waiting for a baby, maybe a futur beast winger ?\nSaw a Super 12 (as it was then known) game where the Auckland Blues played the Otago Highlanders in the late 90's where Jonah marked up against his opposite winger, \"The Samoan Smasher\" aka \"The Chiropractor\", Brian Lima.\nJonah was making one of his trademark runs on the left side of the field when Brian lined him front on and absolutely crunched him and put Jonah on his backside....HARD.\nI've been trying to find out which game so I can track down the clip and post it up on youtube or RD.\nMe & My Friends remember that moment as we were watching that game because until that time and since, I've never ever seen Jonah tackled FRONT-ON and get demolished.\nBrian was also half his size which was also the amazing thin whereas Gregan being even smaller than Brian tended to either side tackle or use Jonahs momentum to bring him down.\nStill....So far, there's been no one else before and now who is the perfect blend of size, acceleration and speed.\nThe DVD this is from that was given out at that charity match (I was there!) was in turn actually directly copied from Jonah's own DVD which was an extended version of this. There were some great special features as well including some of his teammates and coaches favourite tries (Including a pearler against Wellington where he scored from 60 metres out, not deviating more than 5 metres from the sideline, swatting away defenders like Umaga and a fat prop like they weren't there). Well worth the purchase.\nAlso, Richard Turner, the old captain for North Harbour in New Zealand, absolutely smashed Jonah in one game, head on. He was down hurt for awhile and both he and Eric Rush (Who he was opposing) acknowledge it was one of the biggest hits he'd recieved.\nJonah was and is amazing. To quote Steve Mayhew, the All Blacks team doctor and his for so many years, because of his kidney illness, Jonah effectively played most of his career with a medical handbrake on. Imagine if he was 100%...the mind boggles.\ni heard his kidneys packed in because he waS doing reatine before they knew what it did to you..\nIt would be fantastic if someone could subtitle it to spanish, don't you think?\nEstar\u00eda bueno que alguien lo subtitulara al espa\u00f1ol, no les parece?\nall blacks vs samoa in napier 1996. brian lima smashes jonah lomu.it was the first hit he ever got. wrong guy to run it to. they dont call lima the chiroprator for nothing. cant seem to find that footage anywhere tho. that game had some big hits."
