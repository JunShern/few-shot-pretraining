    "text": "Why book a West Ham Minicabs ?\nComparing & booking West Ham Minicabs & taxi quotes online will save you time and effort vs. if you dial taxi numbers to gather West Ham Minicabs fares on the telephone. As a mini-cab ride takes you door to door, it greatly reduces the effort of switching between multiple modes of transport, taking the stress out of your travel and often resulting in a faster journey. West Ham Minicabs can also work out cheaper than the train or coach, especially when travelling in a group.\nWest Ham Minicabs calculates fares from mini-cab companies across Great Britain, enabling you to compare real-time quotes pre-set by the companies themselves. This UK-wide network ensures you get the best deal as the lowest quote may not always be the company closest to you. For example it is often cheaper for a quiet firm outside the West Ham Minicabs centre to come into town to pick you up and drop you near their base than it is for a busier firm in the West Ham Minicabs.\nWhat West Ham Minicabs do you compare ?\nWest Ham Minicabs compares professional, licensed cab companies (known as Private Hire Operators). With West Ham Minicabs, you can book Executive mini-cabs, hybrid mini-cabs as well as cars for up to 8 passengers via web and iPhone app. By adding a request in the 'Additional information' field, you can also receive a mini-cab with a child seat or wheelchair access. All airport taxis & mini-cabs, as well as airport transfers, booked with West Ham Minicabs include the airport's 'meet and greet' charges."
