    "text": "Google or Facebook Ads for Your Print Business?\nBoth Google and Facebook can be used to find new customers online; however, there are important differences between the two. Advertising on both may not be the right decision for your print business. It all depends on who you are trying to target and what your advertising goals are. Most of the time at Snagaprint, we find that Google AdWords is the best option for print service providers because print customers know what they are searching for and have a high intent to buy. However, there are certain instances where Facebook ads are also appropriate.\nPPC (pay-per-click) is the most popular form of online advertising. And for good reason, too: it\u2019s the most profitable. With Google Search Ads\u2019 PPC campaigns you can target users who are already looking for a solution to their problems on Google! That\u2019s where you swoop in and save the day. Over the years, however, PPC campaigns have become increasingly more complex. Running effective PPC campaigns now requires a considerable amount of skill and technical knowledge. Google AdWords can be a powerful tool for businesses in the print industry, because when prospects are searching for \u201cbusiness cards\u201d or \u201cprinting services near me,\u201d you can be right there to help solve their problems.\nWhen it comes to the granularity of targeting options for your new customers, Facebook is unmatched. Need to target all 27-32 year-old female homeowners who work in advertising, has a degree in physics, an affinity for cats and the TV show Friends, and owns an iPhone 8 Plus? No problem. Because of this granularity, Facebook is notorious for having the potential for sky-high ROAS/ROI and is the go-to channel if your goal is to acquire more users for you business. While Google helps businesses find new customers using keywords, Facebook helps customers/users find new businesses based on their own interests and individual traits.\nA common misconception about Google AdWords is that whoever spends the most money wins. However, Google rewards advertisers who use relevant, quality ad copy regardless of how much you spend. This is why it is critical to audit your online ad spending to make sure you aren\u2019t making mistakes that are damaging your ROI. If you\u2019re already running Google ads, we offer complimentary Google Ads Audits. Our team will take a deep dive into every facet of your search marketing from your bidding strategies, account structure, targeting methods, ad copy, to your landing pages and sales funnel. We\u2019ll provide you with actionable insights at every step of the way, which are yours to keep, 100% free of charge.\nEvery year, Google handles more than 1.2 trillion web searches. No other competing search engine can match the reach offered by Google. Every year, that\u2019s 1.2 trillion problems looking to be solved (even if the problem is that people need pictures of cats). Customers are searching for printing services in your local market, and if you\u2019re not advertising on Google or optimizing your website for search engines, it\u2019s likely you\u2019re missing out on valuable business.\nGoogle ad campaigns are text-based; however, it\u2019s possible for you to use one of the many customization options that Google provides. Two great options for print companies are location targeting, for focusing on your local print market, and social proofing, for displaying your customer reviews and testimonials. Google\u2019s custom ad features can help make your business stand out on search results.\nFacebook has over 1.55 billion active users, and allows its advertisers to target them very specifically, which can lead to massive ROI. Facebook allows advertisers to target users based on the details they provide on their accounts, as well as based on the content that they most often consume. Facebook can be a powerful tool for print companies if you have a very specific ideal customer profile or you are trying to market a new product with a narrowed target niche.\nThe main edge that Facebook has over Google in advertising is visuals. Whereas Google PPC is text-based, Facebook ads may boast images, videos, and other visual content to pop out on users\u2019 Facebook news feeds. This provides an opportunity to showcase your print shop\u2019s previous work, or even a video tour of your printing facility. Strong visuals can help to humanize the advertising/sales process and put a face to your printing brand.\nBoth Google and Facebook are very powerful digital marketing channels; however, which one is right for you will ultimately depend on your business\u2019 specific goals and products. For a free consultation on which is right for you, contact us here. We\u2019d be happy to set up a call with you and our marketing team to figure out which digital marketing solution is best for your business. Our goal is to help you increase sales with the highest ROI possible!\nDigital marketing for the printing industry. Simplified. Snagaprint makes it easy and affordable to build new revenue streams for your commercial printing business.\nSnagaprint was created on the idea of connecting the pillars of the printing industry to help transform the way consumers discover, shop and buy printing services."
