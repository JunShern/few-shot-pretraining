    "text": "How it feels when J.K. Rowling gives us more \"Harry Potter\" information.\nJ.K. Rowling's \"Harry Potter\" universe is enormous. And since closing the book on the main series in 2007, she keeps adding to it. There are spinoff books, movies, and a play in the franchise \u2014 many of which reveal new insight about Harry, Ron, Hermione, and other characters from the original series.\nThe wealth of \"Harry Potter\" material also means that there's a wealth of behind-the-scenes information that yields new details of how J.K. Rowling thought up the books, how the filmmakers made the movies, and a ton of other information about the \"Harry Potter\" universe. Rowling even launched Pottermore, which has become a sort of ever-evolving encyclopedia of trivia and back-stories from her world.\nIt's a lot to keep up with. But for \"Harry Potter\" fans, all of it is fascinating.\nHarry Potter is rich, because his ancestor was a pharmaceutical tycoon.\nHarry Potter finding out he's loaded in \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.\"\nOne of the first things Harry does when he finds out he's a wizard way back in \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,\" is visit the Gringotts wizarding bank in Diagon Alley. After all, he'll need some cash to buy school supplies for Hogwarts.\nIn his vault, he finds out that he has piles and piles of gold galleons. Harry's rich! Way more rich than most of his friends. Why? The books don't really explain. But Rowling addressed the issue on Pottermore.\nIn the 12th century, Harry's ancestor Linfred of Stinchcombe developed pharmaceutical remedies that were the basis for Skele-gro and Pepperup Potion. He built a business out of it, and the Potter family maintained the fortune for generations. Some time later, Harry's grandfather Fleamont Potter \u2014 the son of the \"original\" Harry Potter \u2014 quadrupled the family fortune with hair potion. The hair potion is even advertised in a stray newspaper in \"Fantastic Beasts.\"\nGringotts does exchanges between magical and muggle money.\nA Gringotts goblin from \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.\"\nAs J.K. Rowling pointed out, it's the only way Muggle-born wizards and witches could buy wands, since Ollivanders only takes galleons, knuts, and sickles \u2014 not pounds or euros.\nThere's one character from the books who existed in real life.\nAn engraved portrait of Nicolas Flamel.\nIn Rowling's series, Nicolas Flamel is the alchemist who created the Philosopher's Stone, the magical object at the center of \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\" that can grant a person immortality.\nIn real life, Flamel was a French scholar and bookseller who lived in the 14th and early 15th centuries. After his death, he got a reputation as an alchemist who secretly achieved immortality. Rowling wrote about the inspiration on Pottermore, where she said Flamel attended the French wizarding school Beauxbatons in her version of his life.\nGreen gloves were used to make the books fly around in the Hogwarts library.\nEmma Watson as Hermione in \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.\"\nFor the movies \u2014 particularly a scene in \"Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince\"\u2014 the books in the Hogwarts library have a knack for organizing themselves on shelves. The secret behind the magic is that green gloves were used. They worked the same way green screen does, and were wiped away in post-production so it looked like the books floated on their own.\nThere were two Harry Potters.\nThe Mirror of Erised scene in \"Sorcerer's Stone.\"\n\"Henry Potter (Harry to his intimates), was a direct descendant of Hardwin and Iolanthe, and served on the Wizengamot from 1913 - 1921. Henry caused a minor stir when he publicly condemned then Minister for Magic, Archer Evermonde, who had forbidden the magical community to help Muggles waging the First World War. His outspokenness on the behalf of the Muggle community was also a strong contributing factor in the family's exclusion from the 'Sacred Twenty-Eight.'\"\nThe original Harry Potter didn't show up in the books, but he lived around the time of \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.\" So don't rule him out for a surprise appearance in the movie series.\nThe film designers have been hiding a secret character in the movies' fake newspapers.\nWhat does Harry know about the Ginger Witch?\nThe Fourth Estate is an important part of Rowling's universe. The Daily Prophet covers magic in Britain and The New York Ghost covers the same in the United States.\nIn almost every \"Harry Potter\" movie, it was the design firm MinaLima that put together the fake newspaper props for different scenes. They had fun with it. Throughout the series, you can spot stories about \"The Ginger Witch.\" She's a hooligan with a multinational criminal past spanning decades.\n\"We know now that things do get seen,\" designer Miraphora Mina told INSIDER. \"In the past, we didn't realize how much these would be scrutinized by fans.\"\nRead about all of the Ginger Witch's exploits here.\nThere's a perfume company that exists in the background of both the \"Harry Potter\" and \"Fantastic Beasts\" movies.\nDumbledore in front of a Divine Magic poster in \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\" and a poster for the same brand featured in \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.\"\nAnother one of MinaLima's inventions is the Divine Magic perfume company. We first see it in a poster behind Albus Dumbledore in \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\" when he meets with Harry at the beginning of the film. In \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,\" there's a street poster advertising the same brand more than half a century earlier.\nBefore becoming headmaster, Dumbledore was a Transfiguration teacher at Hogwarts.\nMichael Gambon as Albus Dumbledore.\nDumbledore is an academic and something of a magical genius. As his chocolate frog card attests, he's \"particularly famous for his defeat of the Dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel.\" So it makes sense that he was a teacher at the wizarding school, not just the administrator.\nIt was while Dumbledore was a Transfiguration teacher that Tom Riddle \u2014 later to become Lord Voldemort \u2014 attended Hogwarts. He also taught Newt Scamander, the main character in \"Fantastic Beasts,\" with whom he has a close bond. An issue of the publication \"Transfiguration Today\" in the movie has an article featuring his work. Jude Law is slated to play Dumbledore in the forthcoming \"Fantastic Beasts\" movies, which will be about taking down his rival Gellert Grindelwald.\nNewt Scamander was a Hufflepuff.\nScamander's scarf gives it away.\nSpeaking of Newt Scamander and Hogwarts, the character \u2014 played in \"Fantastic Beasts\" by Eddie Redmayne \u2014 was sorted into the Hufflepuff house. You might have spotted his canary-and-black scarf throughout the movie, signaling Hufflepuff's colors.\nJ.K. Rowling wanted \"The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore\" to look like \"a trashy airport novel.\"\nThe cover of \"The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore.\"\n\"The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore\" was a biography written by Rita Skeeter, a gossip columnist hell-bent on destroying his reputation. For the movies, Rowling wanted to reflect the poor, salacious quality of the book. So she told MinaLima to make it overwrought like \"a trashy airport novel.\"\nMACUSA president Seraphina Picquery has a big throne that looks like Dumbledore's from Hogwarts.\nHer golden throne in \"Fantastic Beasts\" was intentionally made to be a visual reference to Dumbledore's in Hogwarts's Great Hall.\n\"There were props designed to connect the film back to the 'Harry Potter' series,\"supervising modeller Pierre Bohanna wrote in \"Inside the Magic: The Making of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.\"\nColin Farrell didn't read a single page of \"Harry Potter\" before reading J.K. Rowling's script for \"Fantastic Beasts.\"\nHe watched the movies, though.\nFarrell told SFX Magazine earlier this year that he was a big fan of the \"Harry Potter\" movies, but he didn't read any of J.K. Rowling's work before reading her script. He wanted to play the role of auror Percival Graves based on that screenplay alone.\nThere's a good reason the Horcrux inside Harry wasn't destroyed in \"Chamber of Secrets.\"\nHarry getting bitten by the basilisk in \"Chamber of Secrets.\"\nFor years, \"Harry Potter\" fans wondered what, exactly, was going on with the portion of Voldemort's soul that was inside Harry. When Voldemort tried and failed to kill Harry himself, he ended up inadvertently leaving a Horcrux inside him.\nBut if that's the case, why wasn't it destroyed when the Basilisk in \"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\" bit Harry, just as its poison-infused fang destroyed the horcrux that was in Tom Riddle's diary?\n\"A Horcrux can only be destroyed if its container is damaged beyond repair,\" Rowling explained. \"Harry was healed by Fawkes. Had he died, the Horcrux would indeed have been destroyed.\"\nMany of the spells are derived from Latin roots.\nWhen coming up with magical spells, Rowling clearly worked her studies of Classical language and mythology at the University of Exeter. Many of them are based in the Latin language. \"Accio,\" for example, sounds like \"accerso,\" which means \"to summon or fetch.\" \"Wingardium Leviosa,\" the summoning charm, from from the word \"wing\" (referring to flight); \"ard\" (from the Latin \"aardus,\" which can mean \"elevated\"); and \"levi\" (which means \"to lift\").\nJ.K. Rowling wrote a \"Harry Potter\" prequel short story \u2014 and the original copy was stolen.\nIn 2008, Rowling hand wrote an 800-page story about James and Sirius Potter noodling around on magical motorcycles and escaping some muggle cops. You can read it here. She auctioned it off for charity, but in April of 2017, that handwritten draft was stolen and it hasn't been found to this day.\nAlbus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore has a specific meaning for each of his names.\nYes, that's his full name.\nRowling is famous for her memorable, magical character names. She's put a lot of thought into them, and a lot of the names refer to some deeper meaning for each character. Dumbledore, as the character with the most names, might be the best example.\n\"Albus\" is Latin for \"white,\" which could be symbolic or just refer to his beard. \"Percival\" was one of King Arthur's Knights of the Round Table, who went in search for the lost grail. \"Wulfric\" may be a reference to the 12th-century British figure Wulfric of Haselbury, who was known as a miracle worker. And \"Brian\" is often thought to be derived from an Old Celtic word that roughly means \"noble.\"\n\"Dumbledore\" is one name that Rowling has discussed explicitly. It's an Old English word for \"bumblebee.\"\n\"Because Albus Dumbledore is very fond of music, I always imagined him as sort of humming to himself a lot,\" Rowling said in a 1999 interview.\nSome of the food in the movies was real.\nOne of the highlights of the \"Harry Potter\" movies and books are the feasts in the Hogwarts Great Hall. Shepherd's pie, Yorkshire pudding, and pumpkin juice seem to be served at every meal. During the epic feast scene in \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,\" many of the dishes were actually cooked up for a more realistic effect. In general, the food was fake and made with resin.\nThe glass bottles in Snape's potions classroom was filled with really weird stuff.\nThere's probably gross stuff in there.\nThe movie's set designer found things like tufts of hair and unwanted guts and bones from local butchers for the potion ingredient vials. The room itself also expanded between movies, making room for more extras in later entries in the series.\nFour different owls played Hedwig, Harry's owl, in the movies.\nMore than 12 rats played Scabbers, Ron's pet rat, four cats played Hermione's pet Crookshanks, and nine Neapolitan Mastiffs played Hagrid's dog, Fang.\nMovie producers stood in for the Hogwarts moving portraits.\nThe portraits that line the walls of Hogwarts castle in The Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal Studios, Orlando.\nOne of the magical castle's features is that it has paintings that move. Some of them had plot significance, like the Fat Lady in \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,\" who was played by comedian Dawn French. Others, though, were played by the movie's producers, who wanted to immortalize themselves in some way on screen.\n15,000 glass orbs were made for the Room of Prophecy scene in \"Order of the Phoenix.\" None of them were used.\nYou can still see the orbs on the Warner Bros. studio tour in London.\nIn the end, the producers decided to digitize the whole thing and none of the orbs made it to the movies.\nThe Black family tree wasn't canonized until the \"Order of the Phoenix\" movie.\nThe Black family is one of the oldest and most important in the wizarding community. There's Harry's godfather, Sirius Black, who's cousins with Voldemort's right-hand woman, Bellatrix Lestrange, and there's also Regulus Arcturus Black, who tried to destroy one of Voldemort's Horcruxes, and Phineas Nigellus Black, a former headmaster of Hogwarts.\nIt's confusing, and the books refer to a big tapestry in 12 Grimmauld Place, Sirius's family home, that features a family tree that lays it all out. But the actual content of that tapestry isn't entirely included in the books, so there are some gaps.\nFor the \"Order of the Phoenix\" movie, designer Miraphora Mina needed to include the tapestry in one of the scenes. So she called up J.K. Rowling, who mapped out the entire Black family for her. It's only from the movie that we have all of the relationships specified.\nIt took six months to design the Weasley's Wizarding Wheezes scene in \"Half-Blood Prince.\"\nA display of packaging from Weasleys' Wizarding Wheezes.\nThe joke shop \u2014 which Harry, Ron, and Hermione go to at the beginning of the movie \u2014 is filled with whizzing magical pranks, bubbling potions, and everything from Anti Gravity Hats to Self-propelling Custard Pies. It's a feat of imagination and hard work from Fred and George Weasley, and it all had to be re-created for the movie.\nMinaLima made the boxes and labeling for every single item. Everything in the shop had to look like it was manufactured and sold by the Weasley twins, and have a bit of backstory to it.\n\"It was a bit of a dream, really, to have six months to design a load of crazy packaging,\" Mina told INSIDER."
