    "text": "Hair loss has been a major concern for both genders in recent times. However, very few people actually know about the causes which include stress. Stress sometimes induces hair loss which is sometimes irreversible. There are various treatments which can treat and disguise hairloss.\nStress can lead to Telogen Effluvium which is a medical condition leading to hair loss. Telogen effluvium is often responsible for large portions of hair loss, where the hair typically falls out in \u2018handfuls\u2019. Up to 70% of scalp hair can be lost through this condition. Telogen effluvium doesn\u2019t actually cause hair loss, instead it causes the hair to stop growing.\nStress can also lead to a condition called Alopecia Areata. This causes white blood cells to attack the hair follicles in the scalp, leading to very instantaneous hair loss. Hair often falls out in patches, but total hair loss can affect the whole scalp in the space of a few weeks. In very extreme cases, alopecia areata can also affect body hair \u2013 causing it to fall out as well.\nAfter hair has fallen out due to stress, it often grows back.
