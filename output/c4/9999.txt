    "text": "Sydney, capital of New South Wales and one of Australia's largest cities, is best known for its harbor front Opera House, with a distinctive sail-like design. Massive Darling Harbour and Circular Quay are hubs of waterside life, with the towering, arched Harbour Bridge and esteemed Royal Botanic Gardens nearby. Sydney Tower's 268m glass viewing platform, the Skywalk, offers 360-degree views of the city, harbour and suburbs.\nIn New South Wales, Australian attractions include Sydney with its famous landmarks, the Rocks (birthplace of Australia), the South Coast, the Blue Mountains, limestone caves, white sand beaches. Or enjoy a day at the Royal Botanic Gardens, the Royal National Park or travel farther north to the Hunter Valley for its vineyards and wines. There are always plenty of things to do in Sydney during the warmer months - from sightseeing and world-class dining, to great walks and fun in the sand at one of Sydney's idyllic beaches. You can even do the BridgeClimb to its high arches not only as an adventure but also for a clear birds-eye view of the city. Sydney is one of the world's most loved cities and it has a lively and vibrant buzz that makes it the ultimate summer destination.\nSydney also has a couple of iconic sites that many may have heard of, the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Opera House, but so many more attractions lie beneath the surface for those that are willing to explore a little further a field.\nNational Parks lay hidden on the city outskirts, with walking tracks leading to spectacular lookouts; sheltered harbour beaches wait alluringly away from the crowds, perfect for dropping anchor and swimming in the potentially the world's most famous water; the historical pubs and cobblestone alleys of the Rocks district ooze convict history, intertwined with Aboriginal arts and crafts stores as a reminder of its original inhabitants and pockets of multi-cultural communities - Greek, Chinese, Italian to name a few - bustle with activity and make sure that there is always something going on.\nFor those who love shopping, a visit to the Queen Victoria Building in the heart of Sydney's CBD is a must - providing the opportunity to shop for designer brands in one of Australia's most beautiful and historic buildings. If you're looking for unique souvenirs, spend some time at one of Sydney's markets, which happen every weekend throughout the city and surrounding suburbs.\nOf course, no visit to Sydney is complete without a trip to the beach. Bondi Beach is a popular tourist destination not just because of its crisp white sand and stunning setting, but because it showcases the city's urban beach lifestyle.\nTo get a feel for the rich history behind Sydney, a guided tour is a great place to start. You can even tour the Sydney Harbour Bridge - by climbing it!\nBest Time to Visit Sydney?\nAustralia's northern half is driest and most accessible between April and September. Warm sunny days show the national parks and beaches at their very best, providing opportunities for swimming and barbecues. The north is humid from October to March, with more rainfall, but this is offset by the active wildlife, and reinvigorated rainforests and wetlands. In the southern half of Australia, the summer months of December to February bring hot weather. Autumn (March to May) is also a lovely time, with numerous festivals and the busy grape harvest. Winter (June to August) is less busy and generally attracts a temperate climate that's ideal for walking, while spring (September to November) often sees more wildlife activity."
