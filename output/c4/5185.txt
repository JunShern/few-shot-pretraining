    "text": "This morning it is with pleasure that I realize that we are already 2 January 2015.\nSo I begin to realize that 2014 is well and truly behind us.\nI do not know about you but for me, 2014 was a year of good things for me and for my family.\nBesides the birth of Olivia, our little girl who was born in June, I have personally spent a year full of good things both personally and professionally.\nNow that we are in 2015, I can look back and take a fairly positive assessment of what I accomplished in 2014.\nDo not get me wrong though! I do not pretend that everything was perfect for me. Far from it.\nLike you many of you, I experienced ups and downs. But thanks to God, I can say that overall the results are pretty good.\nIf certain things were not totally under my control though, there are things I could improve, change or even completely done differently to get much better results than I got.\nAs 2015 is just beginning, I thought it was important to take a step back to think about what I have neglected the past year and think about the things to put in place to make 2015 an exceptional year for me.\nThat being said, here is a list of 5 things I neglected in 2014, and I would like to change in 2015 to really take off my online business, improve my results and my productivity.\nI\u2019m sure you already know all the words that says \u201cThe money is in the list, right?\nWell it\u2019s true. I have personally experienced it.\nThis year, I have spent no less than $ 1,000 in buying products and services I did not even think about (software, eBook, and training) simply because I clicked on a link in an email I received in my inbox.\nYet despite this, it is clear that I have somewhat neglected this aspect of my business.\nYet the facts are clear\u2026 The more you spend time building your prospect list, the more you collect leads. Plus you have leads, the better you can communicate with your list and build a relationship of trust with them.\nOnce this trust is established between you and your prospects, sending them promotional emails and selling them your products becomes easier.\nSimply because they trust you and consider you as an expert who brings them value. So they are more willing to buy the products you offer.\nImagine making money each time you send an email to your prospects? Well that\u2019s exactly what most of the people who make 6 figure online do in a daily basis.\nLike me, if you have an online business, whether in the field of affiliate marketing or network marketing, you must focus more on building your list if you want to earn more money.\nIf you do not know how to effectively build a list, or if you don\u2019t have your own online business, click here for more information.\nSometimes you have to admit we do not know everything. Let it be on the internet or in any other activity, some people think they know and can do everything themselves.\nIn my opinion this is a mistake. Wanting to Do It Yourself can be counterproductive and totally ineffective for your business.\nSo, if like me you tend to always want to do everything yourself, I can only recommend you to think about delegating the tasks that others can do for you.\nDelegating and outsourcing have many advantages.\nFirst, by delegating, you free yourself more time to do concentrate on activities that will really bring added value to your business, such as building a relationship of trust with your prospects or improve your marketing, for example.\nSecond, delegating tasks to other people sometimes allows you to get better results because in depending on what you need, you will always find people more qualified than you and therefore can do things faster and better than you.\nWhat you do not know how to or do not have time to do, leave it to others. You will find on sites like Fiverr.com people who, for just $ 5, can do almost everything that you ask.\nJudge the result for yourself.\nSo my goal for 2015 is to delegate more to only keep my focus on activities that will help me to improve my business.\nPS: Liked this article about \u201d 5 things I wish I had done to improve my online business in 2014 (1/2)?\u201d So share it and don\u2019t miss part 2."
