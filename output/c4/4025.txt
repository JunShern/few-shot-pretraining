    "text": "When is the last time you took some time for you? I'll bet you've had opportunities to get away, and you've successfully talked yourself out of them. You say \"it costs too much\" or \"I don't have time\" or \"who will cover for me\"? Do you ever find yourself holding your shoulders high up under your ears, tension tightening your tendons and muscles? You go to bed exhausted, and wake up too early to begin another jam-packed day of obligation and responsibility.\nWe are usually the glue that holds our home and family together. Sometimes, we need to bolster ourselves -- physically, emotionally, creatively and spiritually to recharge our batteries. Sometimes, we need to say YES to our own caretaking.\nWhat if there were a safe, nurturing space for you to relax your shoulders, and enjoy some breathing room? What if this space overlooked Lake Michigan, steps away from the sand and the surf? Imagine this special space serving as a place to create something just for you. Imagine stepping away from your tiring, jam-packed routine of taking care of everyone but yourself.\nThere is such a space, and I am holding it for you.\nI'd love to invite you to a life-changing experience, in a beautiful setting where you will have the chance to refill your proverbial cup.\nFor up to 20 women who are a HELL YES to this invitation, look forward to laughter, like when you were a little girl at your best friend\u2019s sleepover. Anticipate delicious and healthy food, not prepared by you, but FOR YOU. You're about to drink wine, share secrets, and open your heart to women just like you. This is an opportunity to remember who you truly are without life\u2019s distractions and perceived limitations.\nAre you ready to challenge your assumptions about who you need to be every day? Do you even know who you want to be in your life? Isn't it time to explore the possibilities?\nYou\u2019ll be loved and nurtured and supported every step of the way.\nYour dreams will be cradled in the arms of others who only want you to win. You will come together in solidarity, with arms wide open, welcoming the opportunity to learn and be inspired by one another.\nThis weekend-long, fortifying conversation will be primarily facilitated by me, Charrise McCrorey. You can read my bio below.\nI promise to create an extraordinary, unique experience that will quite possibly change your life forever. I know you will walk away refreshed, recharged, and ready to take on the world!\nThis is YOUR time. You deserve this.\nThe Sacred Place: Lakeside Inn, in beautiful Harbor Country in Southwest Michigan. You will arrange for your own overnight lodging here, and if you'd like to share a room, just let us know and we'll help coordinate. You could also join us just for the retreat and drive back home both Friday and Saturday if you desire, but of course it would be best if you're all in.\nLodging is not included in the Fall Retreat Fee. You will be responsible for selecting and paying directly to the Inn for your own room. There are many different room types from which to choose ranging in price from $95-$200 per night. You will have an option to share a room if you choose (let us know if you need help with that).\nWe strongly recommend that you stay onsite for the complete weekend with us to get the most of your experience.\nYou will arrive on Friday, October 19th between 4:00 pm and 6:00 pm EDT. We will have snacks and wine together; time to unwind and get to know each other, beginning at 6:00 pm EDT. We\u2019ll have our first session led by Roxanne Dirnberger. She'll guide us through a discovery of the connections between us and ways to enhance our lives through building authentic relationships.\nOn Saturday, October 20th we\u2019ll serve you a delicious breakfast between 8:00 and 9:00 am, and then we\u2019ll practice a connection exercise.\nAt 10:00 am we will begin to create life-giving conversations about extreme self-care and what\u2019s most important to us. We\u2019ll explore the difference commitment and intention can make and discover new boundaries for the way we give and spend our time. We'll do some writing and doodling every step of the way.\nWe\u2019ll have a wonderful lunch around 1:00 pm, followed by another powerful session where we\u2019ll explore the edges of our creativity -- finding the through-line to our uniqueness. Jane Lockhart, of Jane Lockhart UX Designs one of my favorite creators will lead us in a fun and easy session and I will share what I have learned from my creative journey.\nWe\u2019ll wrap up the day with a recap of our conversations, giving everyone a chance to share how they are feeling and what they learned.\nYou\u2019ll be on your own for dinner at one of the lovely nearby restaurants. After dinner, you\u2019re free to wander back down to the beach, or cozy up to the fireplace with a glass of wine. Or, if you choose, you can go to sleep early.\nOn Sunday, you\u2019ll wake up to another lovely breakfast at 8:00 am, feeling joyful, nurtured and well rested. We\u2019ll check in with eachother and then move right into another fabulous teaching, helping you discover the way you see yourself.\nKayla Holdread of Weeping Willow Photography will take professional photos of you -- and prepare one for you to take home with you. We\u2019ll have a conversation about the beauty we see in one another, and potentially the judging we reserve for ourselves. This is the pinnacle of the weekend, as all the awareness you\u2019ve created from the Saturday segments bring you into a whole new way of seeing things.\nYou will see how to reintegrate yourself back into your life, with more intention and purpose for loving yourself as you do others.\nNext we\u2019ll create a very special commitment ceremony, where we\u2019ll make promises to ourselves about who we are going to be and what we are going to do to manifest the results from what we\u2019ve learned.\nWe\u2019ll have another brief conversation recapping what we\u2019ve experienced, and then at noon there will be mad hugs a final exchange of love and energy.\nWe will have experienced the sanctuary we were craving, breathing more slowly and deeply, now inspired to create from our purpose with clarity and intention.\nNot Sure Yet?
