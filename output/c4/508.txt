    "text": "Intel is working with US startup Eclypsium to reduce the vulnerability of firmware throughout an organisation, including its cloud links. This pairs security capabilities built into Intel silicon with advanced defences against firmware threats.\nIntel Security Essentials provide a built-in foundation for improved security features and are available across Intel processor lines. The Eclypsium Platform, now generally available, builds upon Intel\u2019s foundation by analyzing the system configuration and ensuring the latest firmware is deployed. With Eclypsium, the end user can see the status of their firmware patch levels, gain visibility into firmware misconfigurations, and validate the integrity of Intel systems as part of the supply chain, even through the cloud.\nThis can also help protect against 'Evil Maid' attacks against devices such as laptops or phones that are left unattended, for example in a hotel room or at an airport. This uses a USB-stick to compromise the firmware with a fake password prompt identical to the original. Once the password is input, the compromised firmware sends the password to the attacker and removes itself after a reboot. However, this nodes need the hacker to return to the device a second time to steal the now-accessible data.\n\u201cSecurity sensitive organizations need to be able to inspect these low-level technologies to look for signs of malicious activity,\u201d said Window Snyder, Chief Software Security Officer and General Manager, Platform Security Division at Intel.\nFirmware Visibility and Patch Management - Visibility of firmware versions across hardware components and centralised patch updates.\nProtection From Supply Chain Attacks \u2013 Find firmware that has been compromised in the hardware supply chain even before deployment.\nProtecting Cloud Infrastructure \u2013 Help protect cloud and bare-metal infrastructure from implants at the firmware level or software-level attacks that can spread to the firmware.\nVerifying Device Integrity After Infection - Bring firmware security into the workflow to help ensure devices are clean at the firmware level before re-imaging.\nThis combines Murata\u2019s communications modules and sensor technologies with the eSoftLink IoT platform (which leverages AI to provide end users with predictive consumption information), providing a seamless private and secure IoT package.

Arm\u2019s PSA provides guidance, documentation, and deliverables through every phase of development, enabling developers to get their products to market faster and more cost-effectively.\nOctavo Systems has launched its first System-in-Package (SiP) product based on the new STM32MP1 embedded Linux microprocessor from STMicroelectronics.\nThe OSD32MP1 integrates the STM32MP1, DDR, PMIC, EEPROM, Oscillators, and Passives into a single BGA package that is 18mm X 18mm.\nAt only 18mm on a side, the OSD32MP1 packs an entire STM32MP1 system in a package the same size as the processor itself saving designers up to 64% in PCB area.\nThe STM32MP1 contains two Arm Cortex-A7 microprocessors along with an Arm Cortex-M4 real time microcontroller, making it a great fit for remote sensors, HMI displays, motor control applications, medical systems, and IoT end points. The integration provided by the OSD32MP1 SiP makes the solution suitable for any application needing a versatile applications processor in a small package.\nThe SIP integration allows users to take advantage of a full microprocessor without the increase in complexity that typically comes from routing DDR and complex power management. The ability to reuse firmware and the elimination of complexity makes the OSD32MP1 the easiest path for designers to move from a microcontroller to Linux.\n\"The continued push of IoT and the demand for more data has required many applications to migrate from an existing microcontroller design to one based on a microprocessor running Linux. There are usually two major hurdles that prevent this from being an easy transition; porting their application, and complicated hardware designs,\" said Greg Sheridan, Marketing Manager at Octavo Systems. \"Integrating the new STM32MP1 into the OSD32MP1 removes these roadblocks, greatly reducing the effort required to migrate from a microcontroller to a microprocessor running Linux.\"\nBeyond simplifying the design process, the OSD32MP1 reduces the cost of PCBs by needing less pace and less complicated manufacturing processes, like Laser Vias or Via-in-Pad. The OSD32MP1 also simplifies the task of sourcing components by integrating over 100 devices from multiple vendors into a single component.\n\"Having ST ask us to be one of their partners at launch really validates our vision for the future of electronics design. Designers will demand more integrated solutions to start to develop their unique applications faster rather than spend time on tedious tasks that don't differentiate their product,\" adds Gene Frantz, CTO Octavo Systems. \"System-in-Package is the solution to provide this tremendous level of integration.\"\nDesign resources for the OSD32MP1 are available today on the Octavo Systems website. Samples will be available in Q3 with full production scheduled for Q4. \"Pricing is still being finalized and will be in-line with the cost of an equivalent system designed with discrete components,\" said Greg.\nSTMicroelectronics has launched a multicore processor with ARM Cortex-A and -M cores and Linux support for Industrial, Consumer, Smart Home, Health and Wellness applications.\nThe STM32MP1 series supports OpenSTLinux as a mainlined, open-source Linux distribution to extend the STM32 family. With this combination of MPU and software, ST has assembled all the pieces to match the product supply requirements of many industrial and professional applications and the STM32MP1 is included in ST\u2019s rolling 10-years longevity commitment.\nThe Cortex-A cores running Linux allows standard high level software such as graphics for user interfaces to be used, while the -M cores provide real time control and low power operation.\nFor example, by stopping Cortex-A7 execution and running only from the more efficient Cortex-M4, power can typically be reduced to 25%. From this mode, going to Standby further cuts power by 2.5k times \u2013 while still supporting the resumption of Linux execution in 1 to 3 seconds, depending on the application.\nThe STM32MP1 embeds a 3D Graphics Processor Unit (GPU) to support Human Machine Interface (HMI) displays. It also supports a wide range of external DDR SDRAM and Flash Memories. Moreover, the STM32MP1 embeds a large set of peripherals that can be seamlessly allocated either to Cortex-A / Linux or Cortex-M / Real-time activities. The STM32MP1 series are available in a range of BGA packages to support the lowest PCB cost structure and use the smallest board space.\nThe STM32MP1 series comprise dual Arm Cortex-A7 application processor cores running at 650MHz and a high-performance Arm Cortex-M4 microcontroller core running at 209MHz. The STM32MP1 supports cost-efficient and DDR SDRAMs, including DDR3, DDR3L, LPDDR2, LPDDR3 32/16-bit at 533MHz, which prevents performance bottlenecks and bandwidth issues on MPU systems. On top of this, the STM32MP1 supports a wide range of Flash products: eMMC, SD card, SLC NAND, SPI NAND and Quad-SPI NOR Flashes.\nThe 3D Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) provides for advanced HMI development, based on OpenGL\u00ae ES 2.0 interface and native support for Linux and various application frameworks, including Android Qt. The STM32MP1 supports 24-bit parallel RGB displays up to WXGA at 60fps and MIPI\u00ae DSI with 2 data lanes running at 1Gbps.\nThis 3D graphics processor will enable equipment such as industrial control panels to enhance user experiences. Brian Edmond, President of Crank Software, which produces the Storyboard\u2122 user-interface tool suite, commented, \u201cThe STM32MP1 platform strengthens ST\u2019s solution and aligns with Storyboard\u2019s industry-leading scalability. The powerful 3D GPU from Vivante\u00ae lets Storyboard users create the rich graphical experiences needed in today's embedded markets.\"\nIn order to assure Customer code is fully trusted, the STM32MP1 Series embeds hardware security features that include TrustZone, cryptography, hash, Secure Boot, anti-tamper pins, and a real-time clock.\nThe STM32MP1 also leverages advanced IPs from STM32 MCUs. STM32MP1 has 37x communication interfaces, such as 3x USB2.0 including 2x High-Speed, 1x Gigabit Ethernet GMAC, 2x CAN FD and standard I\u00b2C, UARTs and SPIs. It also comes with a range of analog peripherals including 2x 16b ADCs, 2x 12b DACs and On-chip LDOs. The STM32MP1 supports 29x timers and 3x watchdogs. Depending on packages, it can also support up to 176 GPIOs.\nST completes the chipset with the STPMIC1, a dedicated Power-Management IC (PMIC) that integrates four DC/DC buck converters, six LDOs, a DC/DC boost converter, and USB VBUS and general-purpose power switches, creating a space and BOM savings to supply all required power rails for the STM32MP1 and for other components on the board. Using power-consumption optimization, the STPMIC1 is an ideal companion chip for the STM32MP1 Series in battery-powered applications.\nTo accelerate development, ST is demonstrating its commitment to software development with the release of OpenSTLinux Distribution as a mainlined open-source Linux distribution. OpenSTLinux has already been reviewed and accepted by the Linux community: Linux Foundation, Yocto project and Linaro. The distribution contains all the essential building blocks for running software on the application-processor cores.\nThe OpenSTLinux Distribution supports development on the STM32MP1\u2019s Cortex-A7 cores and contains important elements that include Linux BSP, kernel, drivers, boot chain, and secure OS (OP-TEE: Trusted Execution Environment).\nEnhanced STM32Cube tools, specially upgraded from the STM32Cube package for Cortex-M microcontrollers, features all necessary characteristics \u2013 and more -- to accelerate microprocessor development using Arm Cortex-A-core MPUs. ST\u2019s solution simplifies setting up MPU projects and configuring the on-chip resources.\nFPGA designer Achronix has launched a partner programme for EDA tools, software, and IP vendors with solutions and services for its Speedster FPGAs, Speedchip chiplet technology, and Speedcore eFPGA custom IP-block technology.\nThe programme connects Achronix\u2019s partners with the company\u2019s customers to provide better access to developers who are creating designs based on Achronix\u2019s technologies, or considering the use of Achronix\u2019s programmable silicon and IP technologies.\nPartners have the ability to promote their company and proven solutions on their own, individual partner pages located on the Achronix.com website.\nAchronix\u2019s ecosystem partners augment Achronix\u2019s own ACE design tools and IP products with expert design support for Achronix-specific, FPGA-based development to shorten design cycles for complex electronic systems and accelerate time to market. Achronix offerings include programmable FPGA fabrics, discrete high-performance and high-density FPGAs with hardwired system-level blocks, datacentre and HPC hardware accelerator boards, and best-in-class EDA software supporting all Achronix products.\nInnophase has launched a single chip multiprotocol transceiver for the Internet of Things (IoT) with what the company claims is the industry's lowest power consumption.\nThe Talaria TWO platform combines the transceiver, MAC/PHY, digital power amplifier and an embedded ARM processor for battery-based IoT applications. Operating with a Delivery Traffic Indication Map (DTIM) every third frame (DTIM3), the chip uses half the power of the leading low power Wi-Fi chips, says the company.\nThe chip actively manages multiprotocol coexistence for 802.11b/g/n WiFi and BLE 5.0 for demanding edge-of-network applications. Initial customer products developed using the Talaria TWO wireless platform have shown battery life improvements of more than 50% versus competitive solutions.\nThe Talaria TWO platform uses InnoPhase\u2019s PolaRFusion radio architecture, which processes radio signals using polar coordinates rather than traditional IQ coordinates. This digitally-intensive radio solution dramatically reduces the amount of power required to transmit, process, and receive wireless information using industry standard wireless protocols. It achieves this by moving most of the radio signal processing from power-hungry analogue circuits, found in today\u2019s IQ-architecture wireless solutions, into power and size efficient digital logic.\nCustomers are now sampling the extreme low power Talaria TWO wireless platform with full commercial availability and certification slated for mid-2019.\nOpen source specialist Arduino has launched an IoT Cloud as part of its professional IoT strategy.\nThe cloud capability is aimed at embedded developers and system integrators as well as Arduio's more traditional maker hobbyists as an easy-to-use Internet of Things application platform.\nThe IoT Cloud includes secure provision, connection and authentication of devices in the field and ensures all data transmitted between the device and Arduino\u2019s cloud is confidential and tamper-proof. Client authentication (X.509 certificates) is adopted for asymmetric-key based authentication, while Transport Layer Security (TLS) is used for securing all traffic to and from IoT Cloud.\nwww.arduino.cc/en/IoT/HomePage or create.arduino.cc/iot to download."
