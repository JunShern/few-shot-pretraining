If they break my rules, I switch \u2019em off, and feigning ignorance is not an excuse.\nRelevant thoughts and/or information only, please.\nKeep checklists of bodily functions (eating, sleeping, walking, purging) to yourself.\nI don\u2019t care what you\u2019re selling. Continue to spam my email as usual.\nI don\u2019t need to see everything you TwitPic, especially when it\u2019s another punchline to a \u201cclever\u201d tweet.\nIf you think of anything else I may have missed, refer to Rule #1.\nAnd to answer the question, \u201cWhy Twitter?\u201d With an aggregator or service like Twitteriffic, I can quickly check in on a relative tweeting their way across the states to a new job, find out why a director had to move his shoot to another location, or hear about someone else\u2019s experience with a new movie, DVD, or game.

But I see it as 97% useless drivel, and I have little patience for that.\nOMG! Tacos! Heh heh heh\u2026.\nI set up twitter about a year ago \u2013 used it for about 2 weeks and felt like I was being sucked in and had no time for \u201creal\u201d internet stuff\u2026.like reading your blog\u2026:) Plus it seemed like it was turning into everyone\u2019s way to share their favorite websites."
