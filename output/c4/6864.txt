Traveling to China is a wonderful experience, but you want to make sure you\u2019re familiar with Chinese customs before going so that you can have the most enjoyable visit possible. To help with your trip, Western Union (WU) has put together some tips on Chinese etiquette to know when traveling to China.\nAge and status are revered in China. It\u2019s proper to greet the eldest person in a group first, and to address adults by their titles if they\u2019re professionals or government officials, or by Mr., Mrs., or Miss, plus their family names. It\u2019s important to note that married women retain their maiden names.\nIt\u2019s common to shake hands or nod upon meeting someone new, although neither is necessary. When conversing, it\u2019s not unheard of to be asked personal questions about your marital status, family, children, salary, or even weight. If you feel uncomfortable answering, politely evade the questions, but if you do feel comfortable, you might find yourself bonding with people over your common ground.\nPunctuality is valued by the Chinese, so if you\u2019re invited to a dinner, banquet, holiday event, or even a business meeting, be sure to show up on time.\nWhen dining, seating arrangements are important in Chinese etiquette. The seat in the center of a table facing east or facing the entrance is considered the seat of honor, and is reserved for the host of an event, or for the person with the highest status. Those with the highest status or closest relationship to that person sit closest to the seat of honor, and then the remaining guests sit outward from there.\nHowever, when a family hosts a banquet or dinner, the seat of honor is reserved for the guest with the highest status, and the head of the household takes the least prominent seat. At all times, the guest of honor or eldest member of a party must be seated first before others may sit, and this person also indicates when everyone may begin to eat.\nWhen dining, be sure to avoid sticking chopsticks vertically into your food when not in use, as this is considered rude.\nIf you bring a gift to an event, it\u2019s considered polite to bring a gift for everyone present. Don\u2019t be surprised if your gift is not opened; it\u2019s customary to open gifts after guests leave. If you are given a gift, graciously accept and save it to open later, or if you can\u2019t wait, ask the giver permission to open it earlier.\nWhen wrapping gifts, wrap them simply, and choose red or festive wrapping paper rather than white or black. When presenting a gift, offer it with both hands, and do the same when receiving one.\nThese etiquette tips will help you fit in and make the most out of your travels in China.
