In my defense, which was out of ignorance, I said because I don\u2019t qualify for the any plans they have and that he already knew I have money trust issues.\nHis next question was not so welcome because I didn\u2019t want to be the daughter who wasted my father\u2019s hard earned cash going to school and now was making very un-informed decisions. He asked \u2018what are the NSSF plans?\u2019 Face palm and admission of error, I said I wasn\u2019t really sure. We ended up googling NSSF and checking out the available plans.\nDo you know that NSSF now has a voluntary membership plan?\nYeah! This is their new initiative that provides employers and workers that don\u2019t qualify as per the mandatory provisions of the NSSF Act the opportunity to voluntarily save for their retirement. This means employers with less than 5 employees can apply for voluntary registration as a contributing employer and any eligible employee of such employer may thereafter apply too as a member for the fund.\nAfter reading that my dad suggested I look into it for my company \u2013 Kahill Insights and its employees. \u201cIt\u2019s better to save now when you are still stubborn at this money making business than when you are at 50 years retired in a shop in Kikuubo still kinda toiling even if for one self,\u201d he said. \u201cVacations are good but how much do you save away to carter for the future vacations?\u201d He added.\nWith the above I am now here considering looking deeply into opening a retirement account and add the card to my wallet pockets. My future depends on me and no one else so I will start controlling it in the present and not be like Charles Temaligwe below.\nI remember them today, I told my dad about it and he said we have better systems these days and technologies. Also that it\u2019s not necessary use NSSF but the message is to save for retirement in whatever way I choose."
