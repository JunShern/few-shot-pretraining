Hopefully I\u2019ll get better at talking to a crowd. I have terrible stage fright. I hope to pass all my classes with A\u2019s and B\u2019s. Hopefully.\nWhat do you see yourself doing after high school?\nI want to go to college. I\u2019m not really sure which one right now, nut hopefully I\u2019ll get accepted to the one I want to go to. I might go to a technical school but my brother said universities are look better on a resume.\nWhat do you hope your life will be like in your 20\u2019s?\nIn my early 20\u2019s after college\u2014hopefully I\u2019ll go\u2014I want to have a job. Not a Wendy\u2019s or Burger King job, but a real job with good pay above minimum wage.\n3 things you could do to improve your health.\nFor one, I could go out more and exercise when I get the chance, which happens to be often. I could certainly eat healthier and bring my own lunch instead eating school lunch. I could also do better at home a not eat as much junk food.\nAt home I like sleep, and type one of my many books. I also like to read.\nAt school I like to read and type one of my many books.\nI like to hang out with outgoing people. They don\u2019t care what other people think of them and are loyal to the ones who accept them as they are. Not only are they outgoing, they\u2019re weird in a good way and crazy most of the time. They give me confidence I otherwise wouldn\u2019t have.\nI am good at reading although I don\u2019t know what my reading level is. I like to write and according to my friends and family I\u2019m good at it.\nA quality you like about yourself and a quality you would like to change.\nI like the fact that I\u2019m loud and encouraging but I\u2019ll listen when necessary. A quality I would change is my shyness around strangers. I don\u2019t know how I met my friends since I\u2019m so shy around people I don\u2019t know.\nSomething new you\u2019d like to try.\nI\u2019d like to try driving. I\u2019ve never driven before because my dad says I\u2019m too young. I\u2019d also like to go out of the country. I\u2019ve been out of state but never the country.\nWhat do you feel like are positives and negatives on your health today?\nMy physical health is definitely lacking. I don\u2019t exercise like I should and I eat irregularly. Some days I skip meals not because I\u2019m not hungry, I just don\u2019t time.\nThis represents my love of reading.\nThis is my family from whom I gain inspiration from to write.\nThis represents my love of sleeping."
