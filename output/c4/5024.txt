    "text": "Living in the Pacific Northwest I often get families with a holistic/homeopathic mindset for the care of their humans and canines. After helping many families deal with worms I\u2019ve finally decided to compile what I\u2019ve learned to share with all of you.\nMany dogs are able to take chemical treatments for the infection of worms. Your vet can help you find treatment in this case. Many will not notice any negative side effects from general medication. However, it\u2019s unfortunatley common for dog owners to notice negative side effects from these treatments and may seek more natural alternatives. I also work with many people wanting to opt for natural remedies because of personal values.\nNo matter what has led you to seeking natural remedies for worms in your dog I hope you are able to find these helpful. Natural remedies take time and effort! Prevention is key to helping our canine companions lead happy healthy lives!\nIf you\u2019re not dealing with worms yet, you can still help prevent them through preventative measures. If you\u2019ve dealt your dog having worms you know how terrible it can be! Here is a way to keep it from happening again!\nClean spray bottle\u2013Be sure it\u2019s safe for essential oils!\nApply to dog by starting at the rump. Place one hand on your pup and move their fur against the grain as you spray their skin along behind. Its important to get the mix to their skin! (I have to put the head of the spray bottle against their skin). Repeat this method on their sides and belly. Spray legs and rub in the mixture. For the face, Spray it on your hands and rub avoiding their eyes, nose, and any open wounds. Lastly, rub the insides of ears with the mixture.\nApply 3 times a week or more. Depending on how common worms are and how at risk your dog is\u2013up to once a day.\nIf you start to feel a build up take a wet towel and wipe them down. You can also give them a bath or take them for a nice walk in the rain!\nThis little guy LOVED playing outside in the rain!\nIn addition to the topical preventative you can also add some natural things to your pups diet to prevent and treat worms. Many of these items can be found at your local grocery store or co-op but I\u2019ve included affiliate links through amazon as well. Here are several options!\nFresh, raw, unsalted pumpkin seeds help expel worms. A generous portion can be fed as a wholesome treat to your pup and yourself! You may need to grind them up. You can feed them the seeds alone or with a meal. *If treating a dog already infected you can add the ground seeds to 2 Tablespoons pumpkin puree. The puree will help their tummy if they have diarrhea.\nAnti-worm mix\u2013 blend together 2 cups pumpkin seeds, 1 cup garlic, 1 cup fennel seed, and 1 cup yucca root. Add 1 teaspoon/pound of food for 5 days on then 2 days off.\nWormwood is a classic dewormer. But be cautious! This should only be used in small doses and for short periods of time! Wormwood is a powerful worming agent that has been used for hundreds of years to expel many types of worms, especially roundworms, from dogs, cats, humans and other animals. Yet it is not recommended as the herb of first choice by many holistic veterinarians and is recommended if other natural remedies aren\u2019t enough. Since wormwood makes life miserable for parasites, it is also not kind to the host.*To use wormwood, give up to 1/2 teaspoon of the dried herb per 30 pounds of body weight at mealtime. Do not exceed three consecutive days of use. The extremely bitter flavor of this herb makes it a hard one to get animals to accept so you may need to hide it in a tasty treat!\nAs you can see, all of these natural remedies will take time and effort! But I hope you will find your pup to be happy, healthy and worm free!\nLooking for a natural remedy for fleas?
