The consequences of not taking the time in your selection process are not worth thinking about as we've seen all too often in the media.\nBe reassured that we're regularly inspected to ensure we comply with all regulations.\nBe comforted to know that all work comes complete with a cast-iron guarantee.\nBe given building regulations certification as necessary upon completion of the work.\nBe looked after by an approved contractor (we're fully accredited by government bodies).\nGet the job done exactly how you want it, when you want it, at the agreed price.\nWe'd be happy to come and discuss your ideas and plans without any obligation and certainly no hard sell.\nI write this letter in recommendation for Regency Contracting (Cheltenham) Ltd as a general building contractor. I had the pleasure of working with Mr. Steve Dodson on the re-design a fit out of our retail premises at out Gloucester site earlier this year. I can recommend him highly and without reservation. Throughout the course of the build, Mr. Dodson was a professional; he was accurate in his initial assessment time scale and cost of our project. He closely managed the sub-contractors, who completed the job with care and precision. In addition, they were extremely clean and tidy in the workplace, the workplace was never left in disarray being vacuumed and swept daily. Mr. Dodson managed the project to ensure there was minimal disruption to the rest of the building. We couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the standard of their work, and overall work ethics.\nWe have used Regency Contracting on several occasions in recent months. We have been totally satisfied with their performance from making initial contact, to \u2018sizing up\u2019 the task, to completing the task and final invoicing. They have always been courteous and professional in their approach and the quality of workmanship has been very good; all necessary health & safety measures have been in place and complied with.\nDear Steve Your Company was recommended to me by a colleague a couple of months ago to assist with building and construction activities. I have been extremely satisfied with the service and found firstly the management to be well organised, quick to respond and economically priced. Secondly the work carried out is professional and in a timely manner. I would have no hesitation recommending Regency Contracting and plan to continue our working relationship.\nI have recently been involved with the construction of a dwelling using Regency Contracting as the principal contractor. The project was undertaken using JCT2005 Minor Works Contract with a value of approx \u00a365,000. The build was undertaken on time and within tender. I would have no concern about using Regency Contracting for other similar works or for recommending them to other agents and clients.\nTake a look at some of our latest work in our project portfolio."
