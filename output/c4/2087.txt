They know what they want to read and they rarely worry about technicalities, as evidenced by the overwhelming success of books with intriguing stories and characters that could have used another edit or three.\nThe boxing analogy is wonderful. It speaks not only doing your ground work but also staying in the fight. The winner is the last one standing, not the first one in the ring.\nKristen, another beaut. Yes! Some bestselling authors have good intentions but cannot teach. That one line, \u201cThose who can\u2019t, teach\u201d always infuriated me, because some of the best teachers \u2013 can change your life. How can that be discounted?\nRemember that old TV commercial where the dude gets slapped and says, \u201cThanks, I needed that!\u201d That was my jet-slap. It was bracing and good for me.\nTwo years ago, a big agent told me I was trying too hard in my first pages. Guess what? She was right. You\u2019ve got to keep your eyes and ears open to all potential sources, amateur or pro.\nWith me, the stick and move are RWA contests. They don\u2019t work for me, so I\u2019m moving to another arena, (mentioned this on your blog yesterday). I\u2019m getting better feedback from editors, published authors and agents. One of my pubbed friends has written cross-genre, YA, women\u2019s fiction, middle grade. She\u2019s incredible. And she\u2019s encouraging.\nMargie Lawson is terrific. So is Alicia Rasley. I just took an emotions course with Alicia and it rocked.\nI\u2019m learning from a number successful self-pubbed authors. Don\u2019t know about other folks, but I get tired of that hyper-polished stuff that kind of sits flat. No KA-POW with emotion. No \u201cmessy\u201d stuff. Messy delivers! It\u2019s like watching Claire Danes on Showtime\u2019s \u201cHomeland.\u201d She\u2019s brilliant, fractured, her character\u2019s messy. I don\u2019t relate to perfect female characters, yet I see a plethora of them in the romance genre. When a manuscript\u2019s been so overworked\u2026. you get a sense that it\u2019s been over-edited and that multiple people are polishing away the originality, the narrative voice. Raw stuff delivers emotion, and some self-pubbed authors have that quality. Bully for them.\nYour blog revs up my day. Thank you!\nA bit of related humor \u2013 Definition of an EXPERT.\nI truly look forward to your posts because they are always helpful. Clearly you care about writers and the writing profession. Thank you.\nThis is especially true of advice from people close to you \u2013 yes, they mean a lot to you, but you also have the advantage of knowing (or figuring out) where they\u2019re coming from when they tell you something. And take that into account when you take their advice \u2013 the same goes for experts. If you learn more about the expert giving the advice, then you have a better idea of how well their advice will apply to you.\nI read your blog every day and I learn something every day.\nWhile I flip through my emails every morning with a liberal dash of delete, your I always stop and read. Why because I know I will learn something. I\u2019ve particularly enjoyed these blogs about boxing and writing.\nSome of my most insightful advice has come from readers. And I know a lot of writers cry down book reviews but I\u2019ve found some of the most abrasive reviews have actually hit the nail, so to speak so I quietly take it in and learn.\nHey this is James Young. I need to write more anyway and advice from a guy like you would be highly appreciated. Thanks!!\nSuch refreshing advice, thank you.\nI definitely like to listen to a broad range of commentators, and teachers on the craft and all things related.\nJumping Rope is the best way to train for total body coordination. The legs benefit the most. You have to bounce around on the flat part of your feet connected to your toes instead flat footed landing on the heels in order to develop the quickness and coordination instead of being flat-footed. It is the same way with leg press exercises on stationary machines and the experts claim that you cannot teach someone how to run faster and jump higher. Where you land on your feet while jogging could determine if you will develop faster speed. Push-ups and chin-ups are ways to develop the upper body without the monthly expense of a club. But to get stronger punching power \u201cto stick\u201d you have to do push-ups closer to the chest instead of wide and it helps in shooting basketballs at a farther distance as well. To stick the three-point shots, you have to guide the basketball into the hoop, like a nuclear missile headed for a point-point accuracy location. Feet positioning is important if you do not have the forearm and shooting arm back strength. Pushing off, it would still nail a three-point shot. Knowledge is power. Knowing how eliminates the fears of failure if one can really get better at their craft. The only expert I worry about is the editor making the final decision. Afterwards I look for a new one, if rejected. Self-publishing is a possible detour, and I am glad that I know today, how to succeed at indie. The hateful discourages everybody so do not take it personally. Bob and dodge and weave and know how many rounds it will take to succeed. A writing career is not like a private college education where your parents paid a higher institution of learning to play \u201cfun and games\u201d with you, which caused you to drop out with a failed education forever, forever because the players will continue to tell people.\nBeing a top flight auto mechanic doesn\u2019t make you a great driver. Why would anyone expect writing to be any different?\nI\u2019ve been with Critters.org for years and get feedback from both accomplished authors and newbies alike. I always get quite a mix when I submit anything. Sure makes you think.\nI have an opportunity to earn my MBA, but I\u2019m thinking I\u2019d be better off taking courses on what I really need help with \u2013 internet marketing. The MBA just seems too broad to provide me with current, up to the minute training that I\u2019m sure i need.\nProblem is, there are so many outfits offering their services, others that will do all the marketing for you with costs are all over the spectrum. What will help me and what won\u2019t is the question of the day. And will I gain from the experience or get raped? My first brush with publishing \u2013 PublishAmerica \u2013 didn\u2019t go so well, so I\u2019m a little gun shy.\nRecently I\u2019ve been reading that blogging is a great way to boost sales and then I\u2019m told blogging is old news, people have moved on and there are more productive ways, etc.\nI\u2019m also put off by the enormous cost of professional editing and yet I\u2019m hearing so much that professional editing is vastly overrated. Do you see how confusing this is?\nEither way, if I do or don\u2019t go for the MBA, my income is going to take a hit until I can generate enough from book sales to overcome that disparity. Just wading through the surf looking for a toe hold on the beach without getting bit by a shark..\nI would hate to be accused of giving bad advice which cost you more money. Given my personal individual situation, I plan on courting the traditional way of Big Time publishers. There is much self-help for writers on the internet and one can really go it alone, (Kristen, if they want to). I believe in individual FREEDOM. For a newbie Blogging would not be old news. An MBA could get you a better job. If I had the savings (it is not an advice) and could live comfortably, I would just continue writing novels and make a decision to self-publish or submit to publishers.\nNo idea how he did it. Might have been that when he originally wrote the story, it should have been three books. But he did it successfully. Might have required adjusting the narrative arc. No idea. But I agree that it needs to be done with care ;).\nI learn so much from Kristen Lamb\u2019s blogs!\nI run a Writer\u2019s Circle that includes everyone from Newbie hobby writers to published authors, and I\u2019ve found that everyone has amazing insights to contribute. Bringing different skills and life experiences to the table is part of the joy of having a group like this, and having friends who share the same brand of insanity is the best part. My manuscript is almost ready to send back to the publisher I desire (they asked for changes). I know 9 published authors, a good dozen more who are working on their first manuscripts, and countless hobby writers. These have been the best three years of my life.\nWriting YA, some of the best feedback I get is from teens. These are definitely not writing experts, but they know when something doesn\u2019t ring true and that is very helpful information. I think the balance is important. Getting feedback from various perspectives can help you see your book more clearly. A teenager telling me a scene doesn\u2019t work for them is good to know, but I may need expert advice to figure out how to make it work.\nJulie: I believe my first novel would be well received by teens. Can you suggest an outlet where I can get feedback from young adults and teens?\nYep. I\u2019ve had professionals give me feedback, some good, some great, but once in a while not so much. And one time I realized I made a huge mistake by not listening, and should have gone with my gut. It happens. You move on. \ud83d\ude42 Loved all these boxing lessons!\nThanks so much for this wonderful series of blogs with the what you can learn from boxing. They arrived just when I needed their reminders the most. \ud83d\ude42 Have a great week."
