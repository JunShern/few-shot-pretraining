    "text": "Orthodontic treatments can correct a variety of problems in teens and adults, including crooked teeth and misaligned bites. Orthodontics can also be used to close large gaps between teeth. At Sudbury Family Dental Care in Sudbury, MA, our orthodontics specialists can help improve your smile.\nThere are several different types of orthodontic treatments available in Sudbury. These include clear aligners, traditional metal braces, clear braces and lingual braces. In some cases, other orthodontics appliances, such as headgear, might be required. The processes for most of these treatment methods are similar. The first appointment involves taking x-rays and molds of the teeth that will be used to develop an appropriate treatment plan for your teeth.\nTraditional metal braces involve the installation of brackets on each tooth. The brackets are connected to one another with metal wires that run along the top and bottom rows of teeth. Metal braces are quite effective at shifting and realigning the teeth. One drawback is that, because they are silver and are placed not the front of the teeth, they are readily visible. Clear braces work just like silver ones but have the advantage of being less conspicuous since they are made from ceramic or composite materials that blend in with the teeth.\nLingual braces utilize brackets and wires, just as both metal braces and clear ceramic ones do. The difference with lingual braces is that the brackets and wires are placed on the backs of the teeth so they are not noticeable to others, which is appealing to many orthodontic patients. Lingual braces, as well as both metal and ceramic braces, can straighten teeth and correct problems with alignment.\nClear aligners offer another orthodontic method for straightening teeth but are not used to correct alignment problems. Instead of brackets and wires, clear aligners straighten the teeth using soft aligner trays that fit over the entire row of teeth, much like a mouth guard. The trays are removable, which is convenient when eating or brushing. The removable feature makes it less likely food particles will get stuck, as can easily occur with braces.\nWhether your bite needs realignment or you just want straighter teeth, orthodontics can improve both the appearance and function of your teeth.
