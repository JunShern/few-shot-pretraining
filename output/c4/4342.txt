    "text": "Trap exercises are used to build the large muscle that encompasses the neck.\nThe trap muscle also goes down the middle of the back.\nThe trapezius muscle is the large triangular shaped muscle that you see going down the back from the neck area.\nThe traps, many times, do not need a lot of direct work if you include some form of deadlifts in your weightlifting program.\nDeadlifts really work the traps hard.\nThat's it. There's only one and you probably won't even need it!\nThis might be surprising to you since the upper back and traps is such a huge muscle. But there are so many other exercises that work this area that we classify as back and should exercises.\nThere is no better exercise for the traps than the power shrug. The power shrug will build tons of strength and muscle in trapezius muscle.\nYou simply bend at the waist and shrug the bar up as you come to the standing position. You can use very heavy weights with this exercise. The guy in the video above is doing the power shrug perfectly.\nNotice that the entire body from head to toe is working during the exercise.\nThe traps get direct stimulation with a very heavy weight during the shrugging portion of the exercise. The traps respond very well to this powerful movement.\nThe above is just another variation of the power shrug. You can use a trap bar as shown in the video above, dumbbells, or any other variation that allows you to shrug a weight up quickly and powerfully.\nI've got another great tip for you if you're looking to build the trapezius muscle.\nThis technique works VERY well.\nYou can add a simple shrug to the end of ANY exercise that has you holding the weights with your arms hanging in the bottom of each movement.\nFor example, you can add a shrug at the top of every deadlifting movement. You can add shrugs at the bottom of lateral raises with dumbbells. You can add a shrug to standing calf raises when the weight is resting on your shoulders.\nTry adding shrugs to many of the exercises you currently do.\nTrust me \u2014 this adds volume work to the traps and will build your traps without adding very much time to your workouts.\nI have never had any issues with ez curl upright rows. I like them because I feel it puts less stress on the wrists. My question is, if I use a close grip on the ez curl bar am I hitting more of the trap? My hope is to work the traps while still working the side deltoid. Will a close grip allow me to do this or is it working traps only? Thank you so much.\nGlad you love the website! I do too. I\u2019ve put so much work into it\u2026 I am glad you are enjoying it.\nYes, the EZ Curl Bar is a good choice to use with Upright Rows. I love dumbbells as well.\nIf you want to hit more of the trap, I wouldn\u2019t worry about grip width as much as I would how far you are going up with the movement. I would really work on getting the elbows up higher along with the bar. The traps will have to work harder at the top of the movement.\nOne of my favorite exercises for hitting the side deltoids while working the traps very well are side dumbbell raises.\nSimply hold dumbbells at your side and do an upright row with the dumbbells at your side. It\u2019s simply raising the dumbbells up towards your arm pits. This hits the side deltoids, the traps, and the biceps very hard. Try to lift them as high as possible.\nThe top part of the rep reminds me of the bottom part of the Dip movement. Give it a shot.\nLet me know how everything is going for you. Building the traps is fun. Don\u2019t forget power shrugs as the traps seem to respond very well with explosive movements for many people."
