    "text": "While summer may be winding down, it doesn\u2019t mean that your car can\u2019t get hotter than a demon\u2019s breath! Thank goodness for the invention of air conditioning. In the case of winter or just generally colder days, you car\u2019s heating system is designed to keep you warm and comfortable. Likewise, you car\u2019s air conditioning system is for keeping you nice and cool and comfortable in particularly heated days. These two systems share a lot of the same parts.\nToday as an ode to our hot summer days we\u2019re going over how air conditioners work as well as why they\u2019re important.\nEvaporator, lines, accumulator ad the same HVAC components for heating.\nMuch like how the heating system works, the AC is based in the internal combustion engine. Combustion generates heat and that heat exits your vehicle via the exhaust system. Any gets dissipated and regulated by water and coolant (antifreeze) which is always moving through the engine block and radiator. That\u2019s why your car has a water pump.\nAll together this entire process simultaneously cools off the engine while allowing heat to be generated throughout the cabin.\nAfter your car\u2019s engine is warm enough, a thermostat system regulates the coolant temperature. This works via a valve which controls the flow of hot coolant that goes through the heater core. It\u2019s a system of cables combined with electronic actuator that manage everything.\nSome vehicles still use the simple rotary knob and lever system to control in internal climate and position of the airflow. Others electronics and digital or touch screen controls but the process and purpose remains the same.\nIt\u2019s actually your blower motor and fan that\u2019s changes the climate of your car. You basically adjust the different speeds and rate at which the air enters the cabin. That is how the heat becomes cold you\u2019re your typical modern car passes all the air through a cabin filter designed to clean pollen, dust, smog, mold spores, dirt and so on from the air in your car.\nYour air conditioner and heaters don\u2019t just keep you cool or hot, they keep you breathing cleanly.\nRemember to always have your car\u2019s heating and air conditioning systems inspected regularly. You shouldn\u2019t have to wait for coolant or refrigerant leak or improper heating or cooling. Other telltale signs could be inconsistent air flow or volume into the cabin and unusual smells. Any of these signs could mean it\u2019s time to take your car to the shop.\nAir conditioning and heating systems eventually break down over time. That\u2019s why companies like us, Endurance often offer plans to help finance the repair of AC/Heating. Don\u2019t let those repair bills get extra heated, any ASE certified technician can and should inspect your vehicle\u2019s heater and air conditioning systems at least once a year. Be doubly sure to replace your vehicle\u2019s cabin air filter as your manufacturer recommends.\nIf your heater and air conditioning systems are well maintained you should not only have peace of mind on the road, but that drive should be safer and way more comfortable!"
