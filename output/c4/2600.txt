    "text": "2011 was a big year of change for me, moving to Melbourne and moving in with SJ, so I felt I should definitely send out Christmas cards this year. I wanted charity cards but didn't want ones that look too 'corporate' which seems to be the way a lot of them are structured. I found some great ones at BioMe but they were $17 for a pack of 10 (but recycled and 10% went to Doctors without borders). I was going to buy them, but then worked out how many SJ and I would need to send...100. So Christmas cards, plus stamps would cost me $225. Seemed slightly extreme.\nThankfully, I stumbled across the cards pictured on the RSPCA Victoria shop. I bought two sets, white ones and coloured animal ones. Much cheaper at $6 a pack of 10...however, as it is so close to Christmas they are now only $3 a pack! That's right, you can get them for 30c each, even cheaper than the stamp you'll need to send them! Plus since they are being sold by the RSPCA, you can be assured that all the profits will be going directly to them.\nHave I mentioned how much I love mail??\nCute! Every year I buy Christmas cards, but never get around to sending them."
