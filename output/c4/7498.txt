    "text": "A dog can bark for many reasons \u2014 to defend his territory, signal a stranger, get attention, say hello, express discomfort or frustration, and more. Understanding why a dog barks is key to getting him to stop. Sometimes, as in the case of compulsive barking, a veterinarian might recommend drugs. But, for the most part, there is no quick fix, and training, behavior modification, and environmental changes are the solutions.\nBarking is one of several types of vocal communication tools employed by dogs. You may appreciate your dog\u2019s barking when he or she signals that someone is at your door \u2014 or when he needs something (like food or a trip to the loo). However, dogs sometimes bark excessively or at inappropriate times.\nBecause barking serves many purposes, it\u2019s critical for owners to determine why their dogs are doing it before attempting to address a barking problem. In fact, sometimes the barking is perfectly appropriate (as when alerting that stranger's approach) and/or a learned behavior. Does the dog use barking to get what he or she wants? For example, dogs that get attention for barking often learn to bark for food, play, and walks, as well. Therefore, training a dog to be quiet on command can be an important tool so that you can teach your dog a different behavior (such as \u201csit\u201d or \u201cdown\u201d) for getting what he or she wants.\nDogs of certain breeds may be predisposed to barking (appropriately, if annoyingly) more than others. Owners should be advised (hopefully before bringing one into a household) that certain types of dogs can be more difficult to train to quiescence than others.\nEveryone knows what barking sounds like. Excessive barking, however, can be subjective. After all, some of us have a lower tolerance for this behavior. In any case, all dog owners should understand that attempting to resolve any dog\u2019s barking problem includes having a veterinarian examine the dog to rule out medical causes of the unwanted behavior.\nIndeed, identifying the cause of the barking behavior is crucial to its resolution.\nIn alarm barking, dogs bark at any noise or sight regardless of the context. When barking, these dogs usually have stiff bodies and move or pounce forward 1 or 2 inches with each bark. These dogs might bark at sights or sounds anywhere, not just when defending familiar areas.\nIn socially facilitated barking, dogs bark excessively when they hear other dogs barking.\nIn frustration-induced barking, dogs bark excessively when they\u2019re in frustrating situations, such as when their activity or movement is restricted.\nIn separation-anxiety barking, dogs bark excessively when left alone or when their caretakers are gone. This barking is usually accompanied by at least one other sign of separation anxiety, such as pacing, destruction, elimination, or depression.\nAny breed of dog may be affected, but it is most prevalent among hunting and other working breeds of dogs. In these breeds, the ability and willingness to engage in what is obviously an enjoyable behavior bodes poorly for complete remission of symptoms.\nMedical causes of barking should be ruled out before embarking on any behavioral modification or drug therapy to diminish barking behavior.\nIt takes time to teach dogs to bark less, so owners shouldn\u2019t expect a quick fix or that a dog will ever stop barking completely. Working with a board-certified veterinary behaviorist or a certified applied animal behaviorist or hiring a certified professional dog trainer is always recommended.\nThe veterinary behaviorist/certified trainer will help owners identify a dog\u2019s type of barking. These are some of the most common solutions professionals will offer by way of reducing unwanted barking behavior.\nTo manage territorial or alarm barking, blocking a dog\u2019s view of areas that he or she guards can be helpful. Blocking windows that a dog uses and erecting a solid barrier or fence around the dog\u2019s outdoor area are critical. In addition, owners shouldn\u2019t allow dogs to greet people at the front door, yard gate, or property line. Instead, training dogs to go to another location (e.g., a crate or mat) and remain quiet until you invite him or her to greet someone appropriately is an ideal alternative.\nTo manage attention-seeking barking, an owner must consistently not reward the dog for barking. Dog owners often unknowingly reinforce attention-seeking barking by looking at, touching, scolding, or talking to their pets; to dogs, all of these human behaviors are rewards. When a dog starts to bark for attention, owners should stare at the ceiling, turn away from the dog, or leave the room. As soon as the dog stops barking, owners should ask him or her to sit, and then give the dog what he or she wants (e.g., attention, play, treats). To be successful, owners should try to never reward a dog for barking.\nIt might help to teach a dog an alternative behavior. For example, if you don\u2019t want a dog to bark when he or she needs to go out or come in, install a doggie door or teach your dog to ring a hanging bell by touching it with his or her nose or paw. If a dog barks when he or she wants to play, teach your dog to bring a toy. If the dog barks when you\u2019re talking on the telephone or working on the computer, give the dog a tasty chew toy to occupy him or her before the barking starts.\nIn addition, teaching a dog to be silent on command can help strengthen the connection between quiet behavior and attention or rewards. Regularly giving a dog attention (e.g., praise, petting, a treat) when he or she isn\u2019t barking is an excellent approach.\nOn walks, an owner should distract his dog with special treats (e.g., bits of chicken, cheese, or hot dogs) before the dog begins to bark at passersby. Some dogs do best if they are asked to sit as people or dogs pass. Other dogs prefer to keep moving. Praising and rewarding the dog with treats anytime he or she chooses not to bark is helpful. Putting a head halter on the dog when he or she is likely to bark may decrease the likelihood of barking. For safety, use a head halter only when the dog is supervised. Guidance from a veterinary professional about the use of a head halter is recommended.\nTo manage compulsive barking, try changing how you confine your dog. If a dog is alone for a long time, increasing his or her exercise, mental stimulation, and/or social interaction can reduce the impulse to bark. It is also recommended that owners seek guidance from a certified applied animal behaviorist or veterinary behaviorist for this problem.\nTo manage socially facilitated barking, keeping dogs indoors when other dogs are barking and also playing music to drown out the sound of other dogs (or distracting dogs with treats or play when other dogs are barking) is often effective.\nTo manage frustration-induced barking, teaching a dog to control his or her impulses through obedience training helps a great deal. Teaching a dog to wait, sit, and stay, and rewarding him or her with fun activities such as walks or play with other dogs is helpful. This condition, too, might require the help of a veterinary behaviorist.\nTo manage separation-anxiety barking, your dog must be treated for separation anxiety. Please contact your veterinarian for this.\nAnti-bark collars deliver an unpleasant deterrent (e.g., a loud or ultrasonic noise, a spray of citronella, and sometimes a brief electric shock) when a dog barks. Anti-bark collars are punishment devices and are not recommended as a first choice for managing a barking problem. This is especially true for barking that is motivated by fear, anxiety, or compulsion. Before using any anti-bark device, seek the advice and guidance of your veterinarian, a board-certified veterinary behaviorist, a certified applied animal behaviorist, or a qualified certified professional dog trainer.\nDo not use a muzzle to keep your dog quiet for long periods of time or when you\u2019re not supervising him or her. Dogs can\u2019t eat, drink, or pant to cool themselves while wearing muzzles, so making your dog wear one for extended periods of time without supervision is dangerous.\nPrevention may be undertaken through pre-purchase counseling. Prospective dog owners with a low tolerance for barking behavior should be advised against adopting/purchasing breeds that have an affinity for barking or breeds that require a lot of exercise, unless the owner is prepared to provide frequent walks and other forms of activity.\nRecognizing and avoiding situations that trigger barking and providing alternate behaviors that are more appropriate can also aid in the prevention of barking."
