    "text": "Roscommon will be hoping to produce a much improved All Ireland quarter final Group Phase display against Donegal at Dr Hyde Park on Saturday evening, 5pm throw-in.\nLast weekend\u2019s demoralising 4-24 to 2-12 loss against Tyrone was a significant blow for Roscommon, who endured a tough 70 minutes at Croke Park. Roscommon couldn\u2019t contain Tyrone following Niall Sludden\u2019s opportunistic 11th minute goal. Before that major, Roscommon had settled quickly, but following Sludden\u2019s intervention Tyrone dominated the rest of the first half to lead 1-10 to 0-6 at the break.\nAfter the interval, Conor Meyler, Peter Harte and Richie Donnelly added further goals for Mickey Harte\u2019s charges. Ciaran Murtagh and Enda Smith did clip goals for Roscommon, but Tyrone were never seriously threatened which disappointed manager Kevin McStay.\n\u201cWe certainly think we\u2019re better than we showed out there. Are Tyrone as good as they showed out there? It was just a non-contest unfortunately, everything we didn\u2019t want it to be. We tried to keep the gap manageable, because it\u2019s so hard to play against Tyrone when that gap goes out to six or seven, they play a system that they\u2019re hugely comfortable with and that they believe in. We tried hard in the second-half, we got it back to four or five, but then fell away again. Just their athleticism and conditioning is a good touch ahead of ours,\u201d McStay commented after the defeat.\nMcStay highlighted the pace and power of Tyrone\u2019s runners from deep, who caused Roscommon severe problems throughout the game.\n\u201cThere\u2019s four or five powerful runners there coming hard from the half-back line, Harte, Donnelly, these fellas pouring forward, Colm Cavanagh at times, they\u2019re strong, strong runners. That\u2019s just a level that we\u2019re not at yet. but we\u2019d hope to get there. Then the natural athleticism of some of their players, you know, Tyrone have a lot of them compared to us. You just struggle, once you go behind against Tyrone it\u2019s a very difficult place to be,\u201d McStay added.\nFollowing the 2017 All Ireland SFC quarter final replay defeat against Mayo and the Tyrone reversal, McStay acknowledged that another heavy defeat at GAA headquarters is damaging for Roscommon.\n\u201cAh it is and we know this, we had Dublin in the League here as well on my watch, we got an awful trimming here one night. You come up here obviously hoping for the best, planning for the best, expecting the best and like we genuinely thought these days were gone, obviously they\u2019re not, we have so much more to do. Some of the standard that we produced just wasn\u2019t good and there were different patches of the game that we\u2019ll have to go back and have a look at in terms of selection and so on, we thought we put out our strongest team on the day, but it never happened for us,\u201d the Mayo native commented.\nRoscommon may opt to alter their approach going forward too according to McStay.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a debate that we\u2019re going to have to have going into the early part of the winter. Because that\u2019s the way we play, which is easy to play against. But it\u2019s a type of football that, you know, I\u2019m not sure the Roscommon supporters would go and watch if we changed our style dramatically and if we started looking at a Galway model, or something like that, whether our supporters would want that, whether our players would want that type of a game. That\u2019s a discussion we\u2019re going to have to have.\n\u201cWe\u2019re two years trying to develop ourselves, get out of the lower division, into Division 1, trying to get a title along the way, and thankfully we did, but now going into the next level, that elite level perhaps, is going to take some big strategic decisions in style and in personnel. That\u2019s what a day like this does to you. You have to stop and say, this isn\u2019t good enough, we\u2019re able to compete with a Tyrone. In two weeks\u2019 time we\u2019re back here again for the ultimate kingpins, so that\u2019s fairly daunting. The match next weekend is really paramount for us, to react to us,\u201d McStay continued.\nDonegal also suffered a defeat against Dublin so an important encounter is imminent at the Hyde. What will McStay attempt to do to ensure Roscommon are ready for the Donegal challenge?\n\u201cI think we\u2019d be honest enough to know that what happened here wasn\u2019t good enough,\u201d McStay states. \u201cThey will conclude that themselves, they won\u2019t need me to tell them. We had a good exchange of views at half-time. I\u2019d have a great sense that we\u2019ve been here before, we\u2019ve got trimmings here before,\u201d the former St. Brigid\u2019s manager concluded.\nMcStay will be demanding a gritty response against Donegal in what promises to be a revealing tussle for both teams.\nWestmeath ladies eventually secured a 2-12 to 2-11 success over Waterford at Nenagh on Saturday. The midlanders impressed during spells of the first half accumulating a 1-6 to 1-4 advantage, but Waterford responded in the closing stages following a smart start to the second period by Westmeath.\nDespite some late Waterford pressure, Westmeath were able to land a great score courtesy of Leanne Slevin to earn a valuable victory. Laura Lee Walsh struck a goal for Westmeath, but Waterford\u2019s Aileen Wall responded as the midlanders led by two points at the break.\nWhen the action recommenced, Aoife Connolly netted a second Westmeath goal as they edged seven points clear, but once more Waterford came thundering back. A second Wall major was a boost for Waterford, who drew level in the closing stages, but Slevin remained cool guiding Westmeath to a vital victory. Galway face Waterford this Saturday, while the following week Westmeath\u2019s next game will take place against the Connacht champions."
