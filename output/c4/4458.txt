    "text": "The Merz has an interesting design, and not one I have seen before. Most microscopes of this age and style have a solid round bar through which a triangular bar passes. The triangular bar has a screw at one end and a spring at the other and it\u2019s a very effective, simple fine focus mechanism.\nThe Merz has a rather different set up \u2013 it also has a triangular block with a screw at one end and a spring at the other, but instead of passing through a round bar, the triangular block passes through another triangular piece. The outer triangle is constructed from pieces of flat brass which have been joined together by brazing \u2013 this might explain why Merz painted these parts rather than lacquering them I think. Using brazed pieces of brass would have saved a lot of wastage and money and it would easily have been strong enough.\nA \u201ctypical\u201d round Baker fine focus block on the left, the Merz brazed, triangular fine focus mechanism on the right.\nTravel could only have occurred in a small area. The solid triangular bar has a cut out area and a small bar is inserted through the corner of the brazed piece which acts as a stop. The pictures make it much easier to understand.\nI have so many lovely microscopes that need work and I am like a child in a sweet shop, I don\u2019t know which to do first! I\u2019m overwhelmed with wonderful choices and I need to make a decision. I would like to get something underway this week. I have a beautiful double pillar microscope which needs a screw making and a bit of a clean but I don\u2019t really think it needs re-lacquering. Do let me know if you agree/disagree with this opinion. I enjoy re-lacquering more than anything else so I shall probably leave the double pillar for another day when I\u2019m in more of a making screws mood.\nI have the Merz which is simple to do and in need of lacquering, I have \u201cthe Beast\u201d which is huge and will take many months to do. a selection of small Hartnacks and the like and a rather nice jug handled microscope which has been painted completely black and really needs some love. When I say it has been painted black, I mean completely painted black \u2013 even the objectives. Poor little thing.\nI think I\u2019ll start with the Merz and then move on to the jug handled microscope. Decision made. If I don\u2019t post pictures of a dismantled microscope tomorrow feel free to come and beat me with a big stick.\nPb or not Pb? that is the question. Pb is the chemical symbol for lead, today I shall be talking about lead. Hilarious aren\u2019t I? ( please don\u2019t answer that).\nI have a new baby to work on. You can see below that it has a patch of corrosion on the foot which has to be treated before if spreads. I shall treat it with a gentle rust remover, sand the area and prime before painting. Here\u2019s the tricky bit \u2013 I like to use ingredients and techniques that are as authentic as possible. I am pretty sure that the original maker would have used a lead oxide primer. I can\u2019t buy lead oxide primer and although I can buy lead oxide powder, it is very expensive and it\u2019s not a clever thing to be working with. Also, the chances of me ingesting some are quite high, because I tend to lick things if I don\u2019t have a damp cloth to hand. I shall be using a commercially available non-ferrous metals primer instead, it won\u2019t show underneath the paint anyway. Interestingly, I can see brush marks in the original paintwork so they weren\u2019t being all that fussy.\nI shall be starting on it as soon as some brown paint pigments arrive from my chums at Ingilby. I need to mix my own paint for this one. For a bog standard black and chrome 1950s \u2013 1970\u2019s microscope I tend to use black enamel paint. either Japlac or a reasonably high temperature coach enamel, sometimes with lacquer on top, sometimes not. This baby is special, it is also much older than 1950 and painted brown not black. Below is my paint mixing kit: pigments, linseed oil, a large ground glass sheet and a muller. Hopefully the brown pigments will arrive tomorrow."
