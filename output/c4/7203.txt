    "text": "When we think of distracted driving, the majority of us immediately think of texting, emailing, and distractions as the result of cell phone use on the road. According to the Center for Disease Control\u2019s Injury Center, distracted driving causes nearly one in five motor vehicle crashes, but it involves much more than cell phone use.\nCognitive: The driver was not focused on driving, i.e., he was formulating a response to the text message.\nAs a result of the dangers inherent in the use of cellphones on the road, there are laws prohibiting the use of cell phones without a hands-free device; however, different types of distracted driving can fall into any of the above-referenced categories.\nExternal factors, such as witnessing an accident or looking for a restaurant.\nIt only takes a second to get into an accident as the result of distracted driving, and depending on your location and the speed of travel at the time of the accident, even minor distraction can lead to fatal injuries. For example, few drivers will intentionally hit a pedestrian crossing the road. Such accidents occur when a driver is not focused on the crosswalk or looks to the side for a moment in an attempt to find a parking spot. Even a vehicle traveling eight miles per hour can cause pedestrian fatalities as the result of traumatic brain injury after being knocked to the concrete.\nIf you were injured as the result of a distracted driving accident, you have the right to seek compensation for your injuries, including medical bills, lost wages, and lost earning capacity. Even if you are not sure whether an accident was caused as the result of distracted driving, a Georgia personal injury and car accident attorney will know what to look for. Rear-end accidents are often the result of distracted driving as are pedestrian accidents. Although it is easy to get distracted while driving, driving is a privilege and the safety of others on the road should be a driver\u2019s top priority.\nIf you or a loved one was injured as a result of distracted driving in Georgia, you have rights! Georgia trial attorneys at Mitnick & Associates have the experience you need to analyze your case and get you the compensation you deserve after a serious truck accident.
