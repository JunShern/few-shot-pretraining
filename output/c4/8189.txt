    "text": "The basic equation of \u2018enterprising\u2019 is to manufacture the product and then successfully sell it at a price which is higher the cost of all inputs combined. This equation is fairly simple and every entrepreneur starts with the same in mind. However, these days we find a visible concept of the \u2018free product\u2019 \u2013 something that runs in antagonism to the above stated equation. Although the concept of giving freebies is as old as the economy, this new concept of \u2018free product\u2019 has been developed with fine analysis and affects business growth and prospects in more than one ways. Precisely speaking, intricately developed free product strategies are capable enough to lift the sales and turn stagnation into growth trajectory! Let see how powerful techniques for customer acquisition is \u2018giving away a free product\u2019 and how brands can turn \u2018free\u2019 into paid?\nDoling out a free product, especially after the new product launch could be beneficial from the point of marketing! People getting the new product turn up as the reviewers and, if the brand has successfully demonstrated the quality, then these people would behave as the brand ambassadors for sure.\nThis fact pertains to the human perception that when a product is being offered for free then people tend to buy more. This is especially true in the case when there is an offer like \u2018buy 1 get 1\u2019 or \u2018buy 2 get 1\u2019 and the like. People try to accumulate greater benefit through more than one transaction just because they get a similar product free.\nMore \u2018value\u2019 perception as compared to when discounts are given!\nWhen a product is offered for free then people value it more than when it is discounted. This is also a fact related to the mental perception of things in competition and comparison dimensions.\nAfter building a positive thought and perception about the (new) product, they are willing to pay more for the same product.\nWhen a product is added as a freebie then the sales of parent product is also found to increase \u2013 one of the oldest equations of freebies!\nFree product inspires quick gossiping and eWoM development through the users of the free product. If quality is assured, then this transforms into branding.\nAll these \u2018free product\u2019 strategies culminate into paid sales at later stage thus earning fat revenues for the company.\nHere Are The Strategies That Can Help Saas Startup To Generate Quick Turnover!\nStartup firms have to struggle on more than one parameter. Their operations are nascent and need stability through trusted links with the suppliers, distributors, customers and others. Low finances are another constraint that pulls back quick expansion attempts by the startups. SaaS (software as a service) startup is a niche in the services spectrum of the economy. The demand for software products and apps is high and many countries/regions of the world have developed fine competencies in this segment. However here also, SaaS startups face constraints that are defined by the specific factors! Over competition is one such constraint. Here is a discussion on the strategies that can help SaaS startup to generate a quick turnover.\nIt is essential to note that in the case of startups in the niche of SaaS, the use of outbound marketing strategies prove less useful because the customers cannot be approached through wider anonymous channels. In such case, there would be more spending while customer acquisition would be much less. Devising specific inbound marketing strategies could be very beneficial and leveraging the power of martech through the web is what is required! Here are the dimensions that can be utilized for generating quick customer base and turnover for a SaaS startup.\nFor the startup firms, the most significant requirement is the customer acquisition. This is dealt in the segment of CRM where the firm should try to productively manage the existing and potential customers. The SaaS startup should identify and work on the leads of potential customers.\nContent marketing proves very useful; for the SaaS, the segment has educated customers that are also curious whether or not a particular software suite/app would fulfill their operational requirements. Engage in content marketing to convince these potential users of your SaaS through dedicated influencer marketing techniques of relevance. Proper content orienting helps attract leads through web social.\nSaaS startup would have to first find the customers! However, after getting the first batches of customers, the SaaS startup firm should not loose them and try to retain them through personalized retargeting campaigns. Make products for them in a customized way so that the satisfaction never is lost. This helps to convert leads into customers with retargeting ads served through the email newsletters and personalized customer engagement/management campaigns.\nGoogle Adwords based PPC campaigns help secure targeted traffic and potential customers. Such a strategy also plugs the gaps in inbound marketing. Bulk email marketing services prove useful to connect to leads of potential value."
