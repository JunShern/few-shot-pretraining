    "text": "\u2026is something most of us have heard for as long as we can remember. The expression seems at once trite, magnificent and so dull that time seems to stand still. It\u2019s no wonder that so many boycott greens as soon as they\u2019re old enough to decide for themselves what goes on their plate.\nBut the fact of the matter is that fruit and vegetables keep you fuller, happier and more energetic \u2013 and they also taste really good!\nAnother reason we don\u2019t eat enough greens is that we tend to forget how simple it is to eat more fruit and vegetables every day. That\u2019s why we want to share with you 10 good tips for making your life a little greener!\nShine the spotlight on the veg! Forget all about the plate model for a moment. Marinade and barbecue a 100% veggie kebab or make a confit from freshly harvested beetroot in red wine.\nMost of us want to make an effort to eat enough greens, but we often hear friends complain that they buy them and then end up throwing them out when they go bad. A simple trick is to make room for your greens on a shelf higher up in the fridge.\nAnother trick is to sneak vegetables into the dishes you love most. Here are a few suggestions: Try mixing a handful of spinach into your pancake batter or adding some cauliflower or parsnips to your mashed potatoes. When you make tomato sauce for pasta or pizza, just add some pumpkin or chopped celeriac.\nMany will find the notion of mixing vegetables or fruit into breads or cakes unusual. However, fruit and veg like carrots, courgette, apples and yellow or red beetroots can make breads and cakes both moister and tastier, as well as keep you feeling fuller and happier longer.\nWe think making juice or smoothies is the very best way to eat more fruit and vegetables. If you have a raw juice centrifuge or a good blender, then the only limit to what you can mix and match is your imagination. (However, here\u2019s one good tip: don\u2019t mix red and green fruit or veggies, because you\u2019ll end up with a very unappetising colour.) Some examples are kale, spinach, carrots, apples, cucumber, mint, ginger, strawberries, kiwi, pears \u2013 you name it!\nAnother of our top tricks is to serve vegetables before the meal, when people are most hungry. For instance, you can serve a good dip with some vegetable sticks. Another tip is to sneak in some competitors to the good old carrot and cucumber. Why not try snap peas, cauliflower or fennel next time?\nMake veggies extra special with a drizzle of good olive oil or melted butter or a sprinkle of Apetina before serving.\nDo you tend to forget to buy vegetables or just have a hard time picking them out? Today, there a range of services that deliver boxes filled with a variety of fresh greens right to your door, putting an end to all your excuses!\nIf you think a salad is iceberg with a few slices of cucumber and tomato, then of course the thought of salad turns you off. Try adding something new to your salad, like spinach, Italian black cabbage, pomegranate seeds, pea shoots or edamame beans, and top with a good vinaigrette or creamy dressing.\nYou don\u2019t need a particularly large garden or particularly green thumbs to grow them yourself. Plant some herbs in your window box or sow some peas in a container. It doesn\u2019t get more local than that!"
