    "text": "Opening remarks: I wrote this short posting in embryonic form back in '07. Today the Lord led me to this specific article to revamp it completely. Previously I had written about the San Francisco earthquake and the Azusa Street Revival, which consisted of the core elements of this template I expanded upon today. I infused into it the framework of the KAIROS MOMENTUM. However tonight as I neared upon the completion of this article, I received an email from Kathyrn Walters concerning an urgent appeal to pray for the city of Christchurch which had just experienced a devastating earthquake. I felt that it was no coincidence regarding the theme of this article and the unfortunate earthquake in Christchurch (by no means do I want to minimize the suffering and hardship that many are enduring as I write this). It is my desire that we unite together to pray for God\u2019s Spirit to move mightily upon those in the Christchurch region\u2014both in bringing forth physical, emotional, and mental solutions while also addressing spiritual needs. Right now is the time to pray as lives could be hanging in the balance in wake of such destruction.\nI will be praying for Christchurch.\nForget the former things, do not dwell on the past. See, I am doing a NEW THING! Now it springs up, do you not perceive it? I am making a way in the desert and streams in the wasteland.\nI want to pose a question to you: Are you ready to step into the kairos momentum? Kairos is one of two words in Greek used for time (the other is chronos). The actual rendering of this Greek word is best described as the fullness of time. Kairos speaks of an opportune time within a limited timeframe (versus chronos which is linear, chronological, ongoing time). It is a season that is pregnant with God\u2019s destiny. In essence it is when the eternal invades the temporal realm; the mundane is overtaken by a heightened sense of God\u2019s presence and eternal purposes. It is the window of heaven.\nYou may be wondering the full implications of the two terms together\u2014kairos momentum. Kairos momentum is the overall, cumulative acceleration of God\u2019s kingdom purposes manifesting within a specific timeframe, with staggering outcomes (which can only be orchestrated by heaven\u2019s decree). It is a divine crescendo of sorts that culminates with a breakthrough of epochal proportions.\nIt is not business as usual; quite the contrary.\nTraditionally when it came time for the daylight saving time (DST) shift in the fall or spring, I had to pause for a moment to recall which way to move the clock\u2014forward or backwards? Honestly, I could not remember; my mind kept confusing the two. However, I finally learned a clich\u00e9 that solved my dilemma: \u201cFall back, spring forward.\u201d In the spring of 2007 Congress enacted legislation to shift forward the daylight-savings time by three weeks. The primary goal was to save money by conserving energy. It also had a leisurely benefit: extra daylight in the evenings (for me, this meant an evening stroll with my wife!). It was a SHIFT that many took advantage of to enjoy the cherished daylight in the evenings (after a drab winter of short days and limited exposure to the sunlight, extra daylight is so refreshing!).\nThere's a shift that is going to bring us from the constraints of the chronos time into the kairos momentum. It is a shift to spring forward into the kairos momentum decreed by the Lord for our times. And it is sooner than you think! Now is the time to agree with heaven's decree that you are on the brink of stepping into your kairos momentum. No more procrasination and unbelief. The Holy Spirit is stirring faith in your heart as you ruminate upon the rhema of Isaiah 43:19: \"See, I am doing a NEW THING! Now it springs up...\"\nIn fact, I sense that we are on the threshold of an actual divine shift that is about to spring forth in the United States (and abroad) today among the emerging generation. It seems that the Lord is doing a new thing in the midst of desperate people hungering for the full Reality of Christ to be revealed in the earth today. Prayer movements are springing forth all over the earth today. Miracles are transpiring with countless stories of God\u2019s miraculous healings, deliverances, and breakthroughs flooding the Internet. God's people are responding to the grace invitation to seek His face above all else.\nWe are on the verge of stepping into a kairos momentum.\nThe words in the text of Isaiah 43:19, \u201csprings up\u201d speaks of a shift that precedes the kairos momentum, the \"new thing\". (For sake of clarity, I\u2019m using the term kairos momentum and \u201cnew thing\u201d interchangeably.) This shift has a causative function, meaning that it is the primary catalyst that ignites a kairos momentum. Think of it in terms of a cause and effect relationship. The shift\u2014the \u201csprings up\u201d\u2014is the cause that catalyze the effects of \u201cthe kairos momentum.\u201d It is the shift that sets in motion the kairos momentum to sustain the epochal breakthrough.\nNo shift. No kairos momentum; albeit no new thing.\nSometimes shifts can occur in a linear fashion that unfolds in an incremental manner, gradually over time. However, nonlinear change can be abrupt, elusive, swift, and without warning; creating an upheaval along the way. A shift of the San Andreas Fault at 5:12 am on April 18, 1906 created a massive, tumultuous catastrophic event that was one of the worst natural disasters in history of the United States. The actual shift itself lasted approximately 48 seconds\u2014however, the ramifications extended well beyond the short-lived fault shift. The earthquake registered at a conservative estimation of 7.7 magnitude, which was felt from Oregon all the way to Los Angeles. The city of San Francisco was in ruins due to the fires that ensued after the shakings, destroying 80 percent of the city.\nChaos abounded\u2014normalcy for many dissipated within a mere 48 seconds. Lives were lost. Homes were destroyed. Families were stricken with grief. Destruction was rampant.\nShifts can be costly. It can either abort or accelerate the catalyzing of the kairos momentum.\nTen days prior to the San Francisco natural disaster was an unprecedented outpouring of God\u2019s Spirit in Los Angeles; otherwise, known as Azusu Street Revival. It was a seismic shift whose epicenter was at 216 North Bonnie Bray Street, but with a magnitude of world-wide impact. Indeed, it was \u201cthe new thing\u201d (i.e., the kairos momentum) that forever changed the landscape of Christianity in the 20th century. Lives were forever ruined for a powerless testimony and witness. Hearts were set ablaze by God\u2019s flaming Spirit as this epochal shift brought about a kairos momentum to the ends of the earth\u2014lost souls were converted; desperate souls were baptized with power on high; ministries were birthed; missionaries were sent; apostolic movements were pioneered. Worldwide was the reach of this kairos mometum.\nA shift transpired. The kairos momentum coalesced God\u2019s purposes with pliable human hearts; and the world was never the same.\nWhat is on God\u2019s heart for this hour?\nYou are in a kairos momentum season. The new thing is close. And the shift is even closer.\nI believe we are in the midst of another kairos moment in Alabama. The Glory Ride 2011 came to town and well, things haven't been the same in Alabama. Midst tornadoes & utter devastation surrounding them, these riders on horseback continued to worship and indeed are still worshipping! A 24/7 tabernacle was erected in 2 strategic places in Alabama and was filled with worshippers for 3 days. for info go to: www.thegloryride.com. What I hear in the spirit is that devastation is selective. Yahweh does the choosing! It has been glorious to hear the miraculous stories of how many people were spared against all odds. When you look at it from the air...it does not appear that anyone could have survived...yet, by His mercy they have."
