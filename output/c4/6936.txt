    "text": "There is only one thing that comes to your mind when you enter a brick and mortar casino or end up on an online casino site \u2013 to leave the place with a lot of money, and to have a lovely ride on the way there. This is what gave Just For The Win their idea for the name and shaped their products.\nThis relatively new online slot game producers made their first appearance on the gambling scene in 2016 and released their first games in 2017. Some lovely games are coming out of their workshop, and they immediately made an impact on the whole image that Just For The Win are presenting.\nAs we said, this company is created in 2016 with ambitions to make every player happy. They are coming from Gothenburg, Sweden, and they have around 20 professional developers. The interesting thing is that they represent 11 different nationalities on their team roster.\nThe company\u2019s approach to gaming is rather straightforward, and one that players will likely appreciate: they want to create fun experiences for slots lovers while providing a level of professionalism that operators and customers will appreciate in all of their products.\nEver since from the start, they announced a major partnership with Microgaming, which helps these guys do their job better. This deal was designed to ensure that Just for the Win\u2019s upcoming games would appear on the Quickfire platform. With over 400 brands using Quickfire, this means that a lot of players are seeing the JFTW collection in their favourite casinos.\nBy March 2018, Just For The Win has released three slots. It\u2019s just vending machines that are the priority for this provider.\nThere are some themes that are more acceptable than the others, and for a brand new slots developer, a smart move would be to create a theme which has already proven to be fantastic on the market. The first slot Just For The Win which was released in May 2017, was Goldwyn\u2019s Fairies slot, and it\u2019s about fairies and magic. It\u2019s a combination that few players can resist, and the lovely details inside the slot speak for themselves.\nAt the centre is the Goldwyn River and she bases on a bunch of fairies that can give you lots of different wilds on the screen. In fact, there are three whole jokers in total. Goldwyn\u2019s Fairies also offers the players\u2019 favourite, Free Spins.\nLucky Links was the second palace to leave the new dream factory. This slot builds more on the classic image of bandits with its four-leaf clover, sevens and horseshoes, and the game is perhaps the most inspired by the traditional Vegas castles. Game pace is, however, of the lower battle. The idea seems more to give us players a truly relaxing game time.\nHowever, everything can be changed in no time. With the lucky links feature that has given the game its name, you can win re-spins that just continue and continue. The final goal is to get a full screen, but it does not happen so often. Another speciality with Lucky Links is that the lines pay in both directions.\nUnfortunately, there are no wilds and scatter symbols that will make your life easier and facilitate your way to the most lucrative wins that the game can offer.\nHave you been to New York and watched the Empire State Building? Have you seen the Hollywood movie The Great Gatsby with Leonardo Di Caprio in the lead? What the building and the film have in common are art deco and this art style is the foundation of the Deco Diamonds. This castle is neatly designed purely graphically and has a music that gives a sense of 1920s carefree days with drinks and charleston from night to morning.\nDeco Diamonds boasts a combined re-spins and free spins round that you have never seen. The fun starts if you manage to hit two wilds simultaneously on the screen. You win a re-spin as you play with sticky wilds. If you get one or more wilds you win for the first time, probably quite a lot. Secondly, you can play on a multiplier wheel. With five wilds you win up to 1000 times the bet!\nJust For The Win is still such a small game developer that there is no need to create a very own ecosystem for the castles. Instead, you get back on experienced platform owners such as Quickfire and iGamingCloud. With these two suppliers, the developer\u2019s slots can be spread to basically all Swedish and European online casinos.\nSome of the sites that can stand with all existing and all future slots from the developer are Dunder and Rizk. In general, the games are also among the most popular why they get a prominent place in the offer. Choose your favourite online casinos or try a new casino and take JFTW\u2019s slots for a trial tour!\nWe think that Just For The Win managed to create a very solid first impression to us and obviously to the slot lovers because their games are constantly played and searched. We hope that their game release will increase in the coming years and they will enrich their game rooster."
