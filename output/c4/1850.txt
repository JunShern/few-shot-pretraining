    "text": "Known as the \u201ccaviar of beans\u201d, flageolet beans are a type of bean that originated in France, sometime in the 1800s (the name \u201cFlageolet\u201d is actually a French name) and is currently cultivated in two main areas in the country - Brittany (north-west of France) and the Nord-Picardy region in France. It is little wonder then, that flageolet beans are considered to be a typically \u201cFrench\u201d bean, commonly used in French cuisine. It is often served with lamb and there are quite a number of popular flageolet-based French dishes such as \u201cflageolets \u00e0 la cr\u00e8me\u201d (flageolet with cream), \u201cflageolets au chorizo\u201d (chorizo flageolet) and \u201cgratin de flageolets\u201d (flageolet gratin).\nThe beans come in a variety of colors and are named accordingly; Flageolet noir (black, \u201cnoir\u201d = \u201cblack\u201d in French), Flageolet jaune (yellow), Flageolet rouge (red), Flageolet blanc (white) and Flageolet vert (pale green). The last two types, i.e., the white and pale green varieties are the most popular and of these two, arguably the most popular is flageolet vert (the pale green variety), also known locally as \u201cChevrier vert\u201d.\nThe fresh beans could be cooked immediately, similar to green peas. The dried beans however would have to be soaked before they are ready for cooking."
