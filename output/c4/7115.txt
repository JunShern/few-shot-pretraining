And also sometimes they would find that some programs were previously listed in Add/Remove Programs may no longer be listed. This situation would be quite annoying especially when you have to uninstall those programs but you just cannot find them in the Programs list. Don't worry because you can try the following methods.\n2. Enter PrriicEEDDowwniloader into the first blank and select Local Hard Drives, then click Search.\nEven if you have followed the instructions above, you may find out that you still fail to completely uninstall PrriicEEDDowwniloader. This is because if you need to entirely uninstall it, you should have to wipe out all the related program files including the registry leftovers, files extensions, obsolete uninstall entries, invalid font entries, invalid toolbars and invalid shortcuts. The sluggish Windows Add/ Remove applet may not capable to remove it all due to these remnants, even if you have tried many times.\nStep 2: Select PrriicEEDDowwniloader from the detected program list and click \"Run Uninstaller\"."
