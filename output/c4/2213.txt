    "text": "There are several ways an Instant Pot saves money! If you\u2019re wondering if an Instant Pot is worth it, check out these ways I personally use mine to save money.\nIn fact, I was on the fence about purchasing one for months before I finally took advantage of a Prime Day sale. Honestly, I wasn\u2019t sure if I would use it enough to justify the cost. I thought it might just sit in a cupboard, collecting dust. I couldn\u2019t have been more wrong!\nOver the years, I\u2019ve found so many ways to use my Instant Pot, and it\u2019s one of my most-used appliances.\nAlthough there are so many things you can do with an Instant Pot, it\u2019s important to decide whether or not the investment makes sense for you. I personally have found my Instant Pot to be extremely worthwhile, not only because it simplifies meal prep around here, but because it has saved me a good bit of money over time.\nHow Do Instant Pots Save Money?\nWell, I\u2019m so glad you asked. \ud83d\ude42 Today, I\u2019m sharing some of my favorite ways that an Instant Pot saves money!\nWith the Instant Pot, it\u2019s easier and faster to cook so many things from scratch, which means I\u2019m more likely to actually do the cooking instead of buying more expensive pre-packaged items and ingredients.\nFor instance, it\u2019s crazy easy to cook up a big batch of quinoa, beans, or brown rice in the Instant Pot. Homemade soups, which are WAY cheaper than canned soups, are a cinch to cook in the pressure cooker.\nAnd, I make my own yogurt in the Instant Pot, which is significantly less expensive than buying yogurt from the store.\nSure, there are other ways to make all of those things, but I\u2019ve found I\u2019m more likely to actually make them now because my Instant Pot makes it easier and faster to do it.\nIf you need ideas of money saving Instant Pot recipes, check out my ultimate list of 40 of the best easy and cheap instant pot recipes for dinner that will help you save time and money!\nMy Instant Pot saves money by allowing me to make frugal meals more quickly and easily.\nFamily and friends will often ask me, somewhat incredulously, \u201cDoes an Instant Pot really save time?\u201d And my answer is a resounding, \u201cYes!\u201d And since we all know time is money, this is one way the Instant Pot makes a difference.\nThe reality is, I don\u2019t have to spend as much time in the kitchen when I\u2019m using my Instant Pot, which frees me up to do other things. In general, the Instant Pot is a pretty hands-off appliance, so I can leave it to do its thing while I work on something else.\nWhether that frees up some time for you to make some extra money, or if it allows you to just have time to relax or enjoy being with your family, it makes a difference.\nIf you\u2019re anything like me, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve had a day where you forgot to set out the meat to thaw, or you forgot to put all of the ingredients in your slow cooker in the morning. Don\u2019t you hate it when that happens?\nSo then you ended up ordering pizza or pulling through the drive-through at a nearby restaurant.\nHaving an Instant Pot means I can cook many ingredients straight from frozen (frozen chicken breasts, anyone?), saving the dinnertime hour.\nNot only that, but if it\u2019s getting late in the day and I haven\u2019t started making dinner yet, I know I can throw something together quickly and it won\u2019t take long to cook in the Instant Pot.\nThis ability to make a quick and easy dinner, even at the last minute, prevents us from spending money unnecessarily on eating out.\nI have often wondered if the Instant Pot is energy efficient, so I did a little bit of research and found that using an electric pressure cookers can save as much as 70% of energy compared with boiling, steaming, oven cooking, or slow cooking. The lower Instant Pot energy consumption is due to the decreased amount of water necessary when cooking (so it requires less energy to heat up), as well as the insulated exterior (heat stays in better). Plus, it doesn\u2019t stay on as long as something like a slow cooker might, because it cooks faster.\nAnd if you\u2019re wondering how much electricity a pressure cooker uses, the Instant Pot company says it uses less energy than any other appliance except for a microwave. Pretty crazy!\nOver time, using an energy efficient appliance can really add up to some savings!\nNot only that, but cooking with the Instant Pot doesn\u2019t heat up your kitchen the same way your oven or stove top would. So by cooking more with the Instant Pot, you experience the indirect benefit of your kitchen staying cooler, which lowers your home energy bill.\nAnother great feature of the Instant Pot is that cheaper, tougher cuts of meat come out nice and tender when cooked under pressure. Think things like chuck roasts and shoulder roasts.\nYes, you can also cook these \u201clow and slow\u201d in your Crock Pot to get them nice and tender, but it is much faster in the Instant Pot (and you\u2019ll save energy!).\nFor instance, I love using chuck roast to make pressure cooker beef stew, because it takes a fraction of the time compared to when I used to make it in the oven or slow cooker.\nPurchasing these less expensive cuts and utilizing them in your weekly meal plan can help cut grocery expenses!\nIs an Instant Pot Worth It?\nAs you can see, there are a lot of ways the investment in an Instant Pot can allow you to save money in different areas. For me personally, my Instant Pot has paid for itself many times over, even if only for the fact that it\u2019s easier to eat at home more often. If you don\u2019t have one yet, you can get yours here!\nHowever, it\u2019s only worth it if you\u2019re actually going to use it. I hear from people all the time who have an Instant Pot, but it\u2019s still in the box. They don\u2019t know where to start, they feel overwhelmed, and they\u2019re intimidated by all of the buttons.\nI\u2019ve helped thousands of people overcome their fear and overwhelm and actually get started using their pressure cooker! Don\u2019t let your Instant Pot be a waste of money. I\u2019d love to help you, too. Sign up below to get a free Beginner\u2019s Guide to Getting Started with Your Pressure Cooker!"
