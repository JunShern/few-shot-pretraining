Performance wise, it has the ability somewhere in the zone of \u201cHTPC-ability\u201d since it can sit nicely in your entertainment center without attracting too much attention. It is packed nicely in a shiny, black metal material that would, unfortunately, attract fingerprint smudges.\nIt has a Windows Vista Media Center that can stream network content, Netflix, watch Blu-rays, etc). The device is also able to support one media center extender like the Xbox360.\nThe Niveus Zone Pro One retails for a whooping $2,000."
