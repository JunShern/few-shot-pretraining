WA I & WA II are identical. We have 2 different weeks to keep the class sizes just right for the best student experience!\nIf you don\u2019t remember what TeenPact is, it\u2019s the class where for a day your 8 \u2013 12 year old is on-site at the state capitol learning about the legislative process from a Biblical worldview, and getting familiar with the capitol campus. If your student is 13 \u2013 19 years old, the fun is further in-depth and lasts 4 days with speakers like Sen. Val Stevens, and field experiences throughout the capitol campus!\nGo to www.teenpact.com to learn more about the program & register. A shortcut straight to the registration page is http://www.teenpact.com/wa.\nThe following is the same information that was sent last September. But here it is, again, so you don\u2019t have to dig around for it. J I\u2019ve also attached it in a Word file so it\u2019s easier to print out.\nRead on for class dates, discounts and even a chance to win free tuition to a TeenPact 2012 event!\nAlumni, we thoroughly enjoyed our time with you at the TeenPact class this past year and hope you will consider returning for the alumni track which is different than the intro class and previous alumni tracks. Remember that 1/3 Carnegie unit you can earn towards High School credit !\nYou may be thinking, \u201cIt too far out to know if I really can go\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t have the money right now\u201d, but I\u2019d encourage you to register in faith anyway (You may put down a $60 deposit and pay the rest over the next few months). You may withdraw your registration and receive a full refund (up until two weeks before the class), but you can\u2019t always get a discount like this if you decide to wait.\nGo to www.teenpact.com/fees (or see the attached file) for other discounts you may be eligible to receive. Please e-mail or call if you have any trouble or any questions.\nAlso, you have a chance to serve TeenPact and win FREE tuition to your State Class and Camp or TeenPact National Convention or any 2012 Alumni event of your choice! From now through January 31, 2012 TeenPact Washington is conducting a fundraising contest to benefit the Washington State Class. See the Contest info attached to this e-mail.\n2012 State Classes, WA I & WAII are the same. We offer 2 classes to keep the class size down to provide an excellent experience.\nThe Early Bird Discount will automatically be applied to your total, so when you get to the payment page be sure to note that it says $185 for alumni or $225 for first time student class fees. Next to that it will automatically show the $15 off for the Early Bird discount making your total $170 or $210, respectively. It should be good until midnight PST, but if there is a problem, just make a note of it, and let me know. Paul can fix it at the TeenPact office.\nIf you just want to pay the $60 deposit, In the section entitled \u201cDistribute Payment to Order Items\u201d change the $170/$210 to $60 in the class fee section and set the remaining fee boxes to zero and click \u2018UPDATE\u2019 in that section.\nTo get the discount for any ONE of the above 6 discounts, enter \u2018president\u2019 in the code box and click on \u201cAPPLY\u201d. A further $15 discount should update in the \u201cRegistration Summary\u201d section under the \u2018Discount\u2019 heading. And your total should also be $15 less than before hitting \u201cAPPLY\u201d.\nIf you order the book, they will mail it to you as soon as you complete your registration, whether you pay in full, or just put down a deposit.\nIf you are registering because you gave us your e-mail at a convention, call me for the discount code that gives you the free POLITICAL COMMUNICATIONS WORKSHOP. If it is too late at night to call, go ahead and register, and then shoot me an e-mail or call me.\nTeenPact Registration for 2012 is open, and the Double Early Bird Discount ends at midnight (PST) on Friday, September 30th\u2026 just a few days away!\n\u2026 tuition to ANY 2012 Alumni event, like NC or Survival, Endeavor\u2026 See the info on the Scholarship Contest.
