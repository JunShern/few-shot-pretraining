    "text": "Last night Masterchef delivered a Thai inspired elimination that farewelled another contestant.\nThe blue team put the bakery challenge loss behind them as the judges announced it would be a Thai-themed elimination challenge over three rounds.\nAshleigh, Billie, Rose, Stephen, Melita, Jamie, Jacqui, Ava and Anna were excited to learn that respected Thai chef Benjamin Cooper of Melbourne\u2019s Kong BBQ and Chin Chin restaurants would be in the kitchen to encourage them and help judge. Benjamin told them to strive for vibrant, happy and festive food. In round one they would have just 10 minutes to create a dish, with only the top three safe from elimination.\nMost contestants chose scallops, as they cook quickly, while Anna opted for mussels. Melita\u2019s seared scallops with a Thai dressing were well received, although Benjamin said he would have liked more acidic flavours. Ashleigh\u2019s soft shell crab was praised, but it was Anna, Billie and Jamie who were safe after the first round.\nThe second round saw Ashleigh, Rose, Stephen, Melita, Jacqui and Ava given 20 minutes to cook an impressive dish, with only the top three guaranteed safety. Rose\u2019s chilli salt snapper was missing something and Melita\u2019s pork curry mince served on a betel leaf was let down by its oiliness. Jacqui\u2019s crispy whitebait didn\u2019t pack the punch it needed while Stephen\u2019s curry wowed the judges keeping him safe from elimination. Ava and Ashleigh then joined him.\nRose, Jacqui and Melita were left to fight it out in round three, with 30 minutes on the clock. Benjamin encouraged them to ramp up the chili in their dishes and personally delivered more. Jacqui cooked chicken skewers, cucumber salad and coconut rice. Melita, who regards Thai as a strength, cooked a red Thai chicken curry. Rose prepared spicy, fragrant chicken larb with a fried egg. In the tasting, Rose and Jacqui\u2019s dishes got positive reviews. Melita served a beautiful tasting dish, but in her rush to plate up, she served very small pieces of chicken. Unfortunately, serving red Thai chicken curry with only a tiny portion of chicken was enough to send her home.\nMelita is continuing her studies in nutritional medicine. She is workinzg towards launching cooking classes in her local area."
