Don\u2019t try to outsmart the tour \u2014 the bus schedules are intended to move people around, but NOT for point-to-point travel. If you just keep moving, you will get to a lot of clubs, but if you try to \u201cforce\u201d going to the clubs in a specific order, you may end up seeing less music and spending more time riding on buses. We will always send you to the clubs at the time when they are scheduled to have music, not before. It doesn\u2019t do any good to get to a club before the band does.\n2. Earlier is better, get the earliest departure time you can and then move up if you can via \u201cstand-by\u201d. If there\u2019s an empty seat \u2014 get on the bus!\n3. If the club you\u2019ve arrived at is overcrowded \u2014 get back on the bus and try to come back later! Same thing if it looks like the band is not getting ready to start.\n4. If your friends couldn\u2019t get tix for the same departure as you, of if they arrived late \u2014 get on the bus, meet up later at Checkerboard or Taste or Spectrum, you\u2019ll make some new friends, I promise.\n5. Around midnight, start figuring out where you want to end the night. You should try to start working you way toward your final destination at midnight, which is when the buses start making their final trips. At the end of the night, all buses return downtown, but if everyone is jammed into the same locations, there will be delays while buses shuttle back and forth, so help us out by keeping the crowd distributed. (see #3 and #2 above).\n6. On the schedule, \u201cEND\u201d means \u201cEND\u201d, from there the bus goes back downtown. We might drop you another club along the way, but don\u2019t \u201cEND\u201d at Rosa\u2019s and expect us to get you to Lee\u2019s Unleaded."
