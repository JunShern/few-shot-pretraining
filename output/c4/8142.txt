    "text": "The following lecture puts forth comprehensive information regarding Assessment of Fetal Wellbeing. Section one is primarily focused on the use of Ultrasound for the Assessment of Fetal Wellbeing. The educator starts off by giving an overview of Ultrasound and highlights the Diagnostic Ultrasound in Obstetric Practice. Moving further, the educator discusses Transvaginal Ultrasonography and Doppler Ultrasound. A demonstration of Ultrasound and Invasive Procedures plus 3D and 4D Ultrasound is also provided.\nIn section two, light is shed on Diagnosis with Ultrasound. The educator extensively explains all aspects of diagnosis that can be made with Ultrasound and brings under consideration Diagnosis and Confirmation in Early Pregnancy which can be made using Ultrasound. Various other diagnosis such as Determination of Gestational Age, Fetal Size and Growth, Multiple Pregnancy, Diagnosis of Fetal Abnormality and Placental Localization are also discussed. In addition to this, information is given regarding Ultrasound Schedule In Clinical Practice.\nIn section three, the educator covers the topic of Ultrasound Assessments. Firstly, the educator speaks about Amniotic Fluid Assessment and discusses how Amniotic Fluid Volume can be measured using Ultrasound. Afterwards, additional explanation regarding Assessment of Fetal Wellbeing is provided and light is shed on Measurement of Cervical Length. The educator also elucidates Other Indications that can occur.\nSection four is about Cardiotocograph. A comprehensive overview of Cardiotocograph is presented followed by a discussion of Important CTG Features and Fetal Cardiograph. A demonstration of Computerized Cardiotocograph is also put forth by the educator.\nThe prime focus of section five is the elucidation of various Other Assessments which can be made in a foetus. The educator elaborates on Biophysical Profile and Doppler Investigation. Moreover, the educator also speaks about assessments related to Umbilical Artery, Fetal Vessels and Uterine Artery. Subsequently, the topic of Cerebroplacental Ratio is also addressed."
