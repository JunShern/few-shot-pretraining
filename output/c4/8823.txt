I'm loving so many recipes and party ideas found via Pinterest, I just had to create a board for the season itself (more than recipes). Last fall, we cooked a lot with squash (butternut, pumpkin, spaghetti) and I'm sure we will again this year. These finds are on the top of our list!\nWhat flavors are you loving as fall approaches?\nI'm right there with you- I LOVE fall and all the great ideas I've been finding on Pinterest make it even better! :) I'm now following your blog to keep up with all the great stuff you blog about!\nLove this! I seriously love every recipe on here- yum!"
