    "text": "Couscous\u2026so good they named it twice! We eat couscous a lot in our house, as a side dish and a fast alternative to pasta or rice. It\u2019s certainly a funny name, and people always wonder what exactly this dish is.\nA rice? A grain? I\u2019ll admit that I couldn\u2019t have guessed what couscous is either.\nWho would have thought that couscous is actually just another form of pasta? Nutritionally, couscous is extremely similar to spaghetti\u2014both contain two grams of dietary fiber and have about the same amount of calories (200) per serving.\nMany people think that couscous is a grain, but the base of both couscous and certain pastas (like spaghetti and macaroni) is semolina, a course wheat middling of durum that is yellow in color.\nThe traditional way of making couscous is a pretty cool process. Instead of combining the semolina with water and egg to make into a dough for pasta, couscous is produced by moistening the semolina with a little water or oil between your hands until it crumbles into tiny granules or pearls.\nTraditionally, the grains of couscous are then dried and steamed in a pretty intricate steaming vessel\u2014known as a couscoussi\u00e9re\u2014to be served as a base or side dish.\nI don\u2019t know about you, but I certainly don\u2019t have a couscoussi\u00e9re lying around my kitchen. But the good news is that instant couscous is readily available to be bought commercially. It\u2019s quick and easy to reconstitute couscous after buying it from a grocery store.\nAll you have to do is combine 1 \u00bd cups of water to every cup of couscous plus a half teaspoon of salt. Next, add the couscous before the water has boiled. Unlike pasta, couscous should never be boiled!\nThe water should be very hot but not boiling. Let sit for five minutes until the grains have swelled. Lastly, don\u2019t forget to fluff the couscous once it\u2019s done to prevent it from sticking together.\nCommercially produced couscous\u2014available as regular or whole wheat\u2014is a fairly complicated process. I linked a video below so you can see how it\u2019s done.\nIt is possible to make your own couscous at home with a food processor, but it takes a bit of practice to achieve the perfect grain size. However, if you have a couscoussi\u00e9re at home, you can make perfect couscous as prepared in some of the finest restaurants.\nWhen you use instant couscous and add water to it, you extract some of the starch causing the grains to stick together. Using a couscoussi\u00e9re insures a moist and fluffy result. Check out this very cool video produced by Williams \u2013 Sonoma on making it at home.\nThink about the actual taste of pasta without any sauce\u2014pretty bland right? Couscous is the same way, which is why it\u2019s typically served underneath a more flavorful meat or vegetable dish or sweetened with raisins.\nCouscous is nice and light and I like it mixed in with a summer salad of cucumbers and tomatoes or stuffed into hollowed-out peppers.\nCouscous can be served as a side dish, as I did with my Veal Scallopini and Artichokes, or you can create your own dish by adding ingredients to make a nice curried couscous.\nCouscous is a principal meal for Moroccans, Algerians, and Tunisians. The development of wheat farming in the 11th century spread the popularity of couscous to become a widely appreciated taste and texture, with many local variants all around the world.\nThe traditional North African serving of couscous uses lamb chops or skinless chicken pieces with chickpeas and a variety of spices.\nOne interesting thing I discovered is that there are three main types of couscous: Moroccan, Israeli, and Lebanese.\nMoroccan couscous tends to be the tiniest grain and cooks the quickest. Most of us are familiar with this type of couscous and it is the most readily available.\nI really like the Israeli or \u201cpearl\u201d couscous which take a little longer to cook because the pellets are about the size of peppercorns. I bought an Israeli style couscous blended with orzo, baby garbanzo beans, and red quinoa and used it as a side dish for my roasted Cornish Game Hens meal this past week.\nLebanese couscous grains are even larger than the Israeli pearls and cook slowly, similar to a risotto.I have never tried cooking with Lebanese couscous, but I just purchased some and will give it a try and let you know.\nhello I like this article about couscous since it is my favorite food. I am from Algeria and it is our national food. I like to tell you that there are more than these 3 types in Algeria by itself. the larger type that you are talking about has another name here it is berkoukes and the name changes from city to another. couscous is sometimes made of barley and other grains. couscous may be eaten sweet with dates honey or grapes and milk as it may be eaten with fish meat chicken vegies and other preparation.\nThanks Meriem for sharing that information.\nWhat you call Israeli couscous is called barkoukiche, there is no more Berber as a dish, just like couscous.In Algeria where it is manufactured in factory it is sold under the name of \u201d petits plombs \u201d in french language ( small lead ).\nIt is the French repatriated from Algeria in 1962 which made known couscous in France where it became the second favorite dish of the French.I suppose that \u201cIsraeli couscous\u201d was reported by Algerian Jews in Israel in the same way.\nDZ, thank you for your informative information about couscous. Very interesting."
