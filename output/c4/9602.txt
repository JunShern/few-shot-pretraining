    "text": "I had previous experience working with patient care and, in particular, with victims of Alzheimer's Disease.\nLast, but not least, I am a writer - although not yet professionally published, I've been active online and informally offline for years; during the caregiving cycle, I'd written about my experiences and posted them online as a means of coping. I'd also written a science-fiction fantasy book (with another co-author) that I was hoping to get published.\nRecently this fellow and I picked up the thread of our occasional conversation once again. And discovered that both of us, independently, had been thinking of writing up a book about the experience of care giving. It didn\u2019t take long before we realized that together we could produce a more comprehensive book, and a lot more easily, drawing on our individual experiences to show similarities and different choices.\nHe is a writer - a professionally published one, at that; during the caregiving cycle, he'd written about his experiences and posted them online as a means of coping. He's also written a science-fiction fantasy book that you can find out more about here.\nAnyway...I wanted to share this bit of news with you folks, as many of you have shared our journey through the caregiving cycle, and many more have taken the same journey before us, while still more are facing it now.\nAsk questions if you'd like to know more; feel free to take a look at our past diaries, searching on either name here plus using a tag of \"Alzheimer's\" and setting the earliest date to 3/1/2006.\nWe look forward to hearing from you, and hope that if you read the book, you'll let us know what you think of it. We're hoping that it will be available in early summer.\nI think I've conveyed a little bit of the insanity swirling around my agenda lately. But damn it's been busy, I'll have to read this in catch up made, thanks for posting it."
