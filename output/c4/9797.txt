    "text": "So your a business in Ireland with a website. Great start! Now, the hard part. Getting your business found! So many businesses in Ireland think just by having a website they should start driving business over night. Unfortunately it\u2019s not so easy.\nSomething I\u2019v always been saying to clients is \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you have the most expensive website, if it\u2019s not been found it\u2019s worthless!\u201c.\nI tend to also mention to people and clients.. Check out the way you yourself actually search online. For example, would you ever goto the second page of a Google search if you where looking for a product or service? My guess is not.\nIt\u2019s said that 93% of Google searchers in Ireland never really click below the first five results! This stat alone should make you think!\nTechnical On-page stuff like Page Speed is important!\nMobile Friendly Pages is a HUGE advantage and a must do.\nAnother thing to think about is Google Ads vs Google Organic in Ireland. How many times do you actually skip the ads that Google are displaying? My guess is probably a lot.\nWe humans are funny like that. We subconsciously think well if Google rank this company website #1, #2 or #3 they must be trustworthy. Really if you think about it, we all do it.\nThese 5 tips are for you if you want to have the best chance to rank your website in Googles organic search results in Ireland.\nProbably one of the most important pieces of info from this entire article! Why? Because this is one of the best ways that Google determine what to rank your page for.\nBasically if you want your website to rank for a specific keyword, lets say \u201cMechanic Dublin\u201d. What you need to do is build a web page and within the META tags make sure your keyword \u201cMechanic Dublin\u201d is mentioned in the title and the description.\nUse Numbers: Numbers tend to catch the eye of a searcher and standout from lettering!\nMETA Length: A meta title has a max character limit of 60 and the meta description 160. You can run META test here!"
