But, to get student visa, you should get an admission letter from any university in Canada or Australia. To get admission, you should complete one exam called IELTS. Because, most of the universities in Canada and Germany offers admission by considering the IELTS score of candidates. So, first you should complete IELTS exam. After completing the exams, you can apply for admission in universities, by sending your application form along with your test scores. Then the universities will send you an admission letter, if your academic profile satisfies university admission criteria.\nIELTS exam score will be calculated in 10 bands."
