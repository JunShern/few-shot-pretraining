I have built my business using three core values; honesty, integrity, and exceptional customer service.\nHonesty is the cornerstone of these values, without it, I would have not been fortunate enough to assist several hundred families with their home financing.\nIntegrity is my second core value; I have shared my knowledge with thousands of families, assisting them with responsible, affordable home loan options.\nLast, but not least, is exceptional customer service; I communicate extremely well with all parties and set the proper expectations on each and every loan.\nMy ultimate goal is simple\u2026to satisfy my clients while creating a positive loan experience.\nI am truly passionate about my profession, and the result is that nearly all my business is by referral from satisfied clients, trusted financial advisors, and the most experienced realtors.\nFrom first-time buyers to sophisticated borrowers, purchasing your first home or refinancing your current home, I bring my diverse lending background to you as a consultant and team player. My clients\u2019 loans are packaged to meet the rigorous requirements of the underwriters and my commitment to outstanding communication alleviates clients\u2019 and Realtors\u2019 concerns during a transaction.\nI am a proud graduate of Walsh College of Accountancy and Business Administration in Troy, MI, and currently reside in West Bloomfield MI, with my wife, Carin, and our two children Dana and Eli.
