    "text": "I loved this attitude from Faith and I am exceedingly grateful to the thrift stores for accepting my stuff too.\nI liked this short comment from Ann. The benefits of decluttering are realised in little ways that add up to a big difference in the long run. In what little ways have you noticed the difference a little decluttering can make?\nOur friend Dizzy has the most interesting comments at times and this one is a doozy.\nWe have another new reader Karen who has recently started to declutter and blog about it. Take a look at her site ~ stashingless.blogspot.com ~ she has gotten rid of a lot of kitchen items and yarn and that was just two of the many items that have gone since the 26th of December.\nAnd here is a link just for fun. Cindy shared this one with me and I had to feature it here for all you book lovers out there. Enjoy! The joy of books.\nI must give a warning before you read this next link as his idea is sound but his language can be a little colourful at times and some may find it offensive. jaeminyi.com ~ Stop buying, start \u201ctemporarily owning\u201d.\nSpendwisemom sent we this link that is a real eye opener. The lady in the interview said it was shameful and she was right about that. All I can think of when I see this is the people are starving in the world.\nHere\u2019s another good link sent to me from Cindy. womensvoicesforchange.org ~ My battles with clutter \u2013 Sorting the wheat from the chaff.\nAnd why has it taken so long for these to make it onto the market. I believe the technology has been around for years. Hush money perhaps? popularmechanics.com ~ The world\u2019s first air-powered car.\nI think these are discs from a hard drive. One of those things set aside that might come in useful one day. Surprisingly enough one day never came.\nA cool afternoon breeze, taking the time to welcome the new neighbours, refreshing watermelon for lunch and finally ordering my new glasses. My desire not to shop does sometimes impede my progress at buying the things I do need, but I am OK with that.\nThey THREW AWAY half of a grass feed cow that\u2019s been stored in the freezer!!!!! Are they INSANE?????\nNo, Just extremely wasteful and most likely materialistic and ambitious. As I see they are probably one of those double income families who aren\u2019t just striving to put food on the table for them and their children. They are simple working hard to achieve all the stuff they don\u2019t really need at the expense everything else. Sound familiar? If they have no time to cook a meal how much time do you think they are spending as a family. I just hope it is worth it for them in the end.\nI enjoyed your Friday favorites this week. The food wasters were particularly distressing. I guess they were \u201caspirational\u201d cooks, who ended up eating their meals out. Food waste has always really bothered me. We\u2019re renting a house with a small fridge (just bigger that dorm-sized), so I have to make a list and stick to it when I go grocery shopping. There\u2019s no place for food clutter in our house.\nI think you are exactly right, aspirational cooks for sure. And you know what Delona I would stick with the little fridge because in reality you don\u2019t need one any bigger. The one you have is teaching you good shopping habits.\nI mostly use drink coasters on my wood furniture so they need to have full coverage or hot beverages will damage the surface. Thank you for the tip anyway Lynda.\nSome great comments and some great links. The food wasters one was especially interesting. We aren\u2019t as bad as that when it comes to wasting but we are not winning when it comes to monthly shopping and meal planning. We were very good at one time at buying once a month except for perishables, planning our meals and using up what we bought. Now I am finding that neither of us have very good appetites and we want something fast and not much of it. It\u2019s back to figuring out what we will really eat and how. I want one of those air cars. Actually, I wish we lived where I could do without a car for the most part. Maybe a place where you use one of those community cars where people share several cars. I think it would make people more aware of how much they are driving impulsively. It\u2019s easy to get in the car for a quick trip when it is sitting in the drive. You are more apt to think and plan when you have to use public transportation or a shared car.\nI am surprised you don\u2019t have the food planning down pat Deb J. I thought for sure you would be on top of this. As you say it is time then that you start observing your habits and alter your shopping accordingly. I am tending to shop local more often these days regardless of the price difference. I and up with better quality and fresher food with no waste what-so-ever. And it is easy to shop without plastic with the local stores as well.\nI want an air-car too. That is the only car I would own. If I had to go on a long trip I would just hire a standard car.\nColleen, I definitely need new glasses but probably not the sort you wrote about. I read \u201cthe world\u2019s first air powered car\u201d as \u201cthe world\u2019s first air powered ear\u201d! You don\u2019t want to know about the Picasso-like images that flashed through my mind.\nNo Shirls we are talking about the same glasses. The reading strength of my eye-glasses is starting to fail me and like you I see things incorrectly at times. I can\u2019t imagine what the images were you saw when you read \u201cworld\u2019s first air-powered ear\u201d. That is funny. It gives \u201cblowing in your ear\u201d a whole new meaning I am sure.\nFood waste\u2026. attrocious! But it doesn\u2019t happen in my house very often. I cook at home, and if something is close to the best before date (it rarely happens unless I buy it that way to get a bargain) it gets used ASAP.\nAir powered car\u2026. I know I\u2019ve seen air powered vehicles (with compressor tanks) before\u2026 maybe mining equipment? I wonder how they get any range and prevent diminishing power?\nStashingless is on the same path I am so I like it.\nOwning temporarily\u2026. so that\u2019s what I can call it! I\u2019m not quite as extreme as that guy, but I started thinking of a purchase as a temporary arrangement a while back. When I buy something (used usually) I think about how many uses I\u2019ll get out of it before I will be donating it to the thrift store. It helps me put a limit on how much I\u2019ll spend on one-use items like fancy dresses (I\u2019ll often ask my sister if I can borrow something instead).\nI have seen one of those air~powered cars on the British TV show Coast. One was used by the caretaker on a little Island. The article said they have a range of about 120km I think that would be far enough for a vehicle that is just meant for around town. I would just hire a car for longer trips.\nOwning temporarily is even better if it is just through borrowing. No expenditure there and no problems with what to do with it when you are done.\nThanks for this week\u2019s links.\nI especially enjoyed the new Stash Less blog, and immediately added it to my blog roll. The author has a very entertaining writing style. Can\u2019t wait to read more.\nYeah I like (her?) it too! Simple, and inspiring!\nI am sure Karen will be pleased to hear that.\nLoved the \u201cstop buying, start \u2018temporarily owning\u2019 \u201d article. That\u2019s pretty much how I lived during my college years out of necessity. I hope one day to sort of get back to that, because I love the idea of one not really owning anything indefinitely; that way objects have less of a hold on you.\nI checked out Karen\u2019s blog site and wanted to leave an encouraging comment, but I don\u2019t subscribe to any of those profiles. Just thought maybe she would see this and change how a person can comment. Could be other people have the same situation. Thank you.\nHi Di, I felt the same way. The option of Name/URL is the one I prefer.\nI liked the temporary owning \u2013 something I\u2019ve thought of (but not done!). I can\u2019t pay my bills came up (I open them all and then read), and I thought it was some random spam/pop up, opps, and then closed it.\nI have forwarded your comment to Cindy so she knows. She will be proud.\nBuy second hand or borrow and then resell or give back. It is a great concept.\nYou silly Billy, I can\u2019t pay my bills is legit.\nHi Colleen, the \u201cJoy of Books\u201d link almost made me cry with happiness!\nFinally back on-line after our move (yay!) and am pleased to report that even though this new house is smaller than our old one *everything* fits!! It is a real testament to all the decluttering I\u2019ve been doing these past few years. There are even some empty shelves in the kitchen and bathroom cupboards, which makes me very happy. Now that I have a shed I can put my charity donation box there, so I don\u2019t trip over it in the hallway every day \ud83d\ude42 There are SIX op shops within walking distance that I am just itching to investigate, and I think today is the day. Have 2 full archive boxes of stuff to donate already.\nNow off to read the other Friday links.\nI knew you would love that link Loretta. I am so pleased you are all settled in and your location sounds so convenient. Maybe you could devote some of your time to volunteering at one of those thrift shops.\nYou\u2019ll be a local before you know it.\nfood waste is horrible. but it happens. I try to avoid it, but its hard. I get a weekly box with veggies and fruits and so I always have stuff at home. on the one side, thats amazing, because I prepare and eat so many things now, I would never ever buy myself in the supermarket. On the other side, there is also stuff that requires some serious cooking and time intense preparations, and there are weeks in my life where I am not really up for that. And then there is stuff that I simply dont like (but thats rarely happening, and if I give it to friends who like it).\nThere is the opportunity in my neighbourhood to purchase those veg & fruit boxes but I always feel that with the stuff being random I may end up wasting some of it. I know they are usually a lot less expensive but I think I will stick with my local green grocer.\nEnjoy that marbelade, it is so yummy on toast for breakfast. It is also good with Nutella (chocolate spread) on crepes. Mmmmmmm!\nthe thing is: I really really enjoy trying new things. I am forced to find new recipes and the best thing: everything is organic and local (you can taste the difference). I really enjoyed this weeks box and everything (!!) is gone already.\nI opened one orange marmelade and I loved it. I dont buy nutella anymore, because once the jar is open, I cant stop.\nSo Lena has a nutella weakness hey! Best to stay away from that then since you have lost so much weigh lately it would be a shame to put it all back on.\nYou make a good point about the new stuff in the box giving you the chance to try new things and new recipes. That part I wouldn\u2019t mind so much. Quantities could be my problem especially fruit as I am the only one who eats it in this house. My hubby is on a low carb diet and although he loves fruit sugar is sugar whether it is lactose, sucrose or fructose. He does eat lots of vegetables though.\nI disagree. there is a big difference between fruit sugar and industrial sugar. and if you eat a lot of fruits and veggies you dont have to do the additional nutrition pill-popping. totally useless in my opinion.\nI agree Lena, there is a big difference between the sugars but they are all carbs. I actually was a bit disappointed when he said he was cutting fruit with the new eating lifestyle. He used to eat two pieces of fruit per day and was never sick. But he still doesn\u2019t get sick and he has lost 15kg and he does eat lots more veggies. No potatoes of course because they are all starch another carb.\nwow. I could never stop eating potatoes (or other carbs for that matter). far too good and practical\u2026 but good for him losing 15 kg, thats massive!!\nThanks for the mention, Colleen! I\u2019m loving having the blog to share what I\u2019m getting rid of and knowing I need to post daily keeps me looking for things to donate/sell. I\u2019m starting to see some empty spaces\u2026 and I\u2019m loving it!\nThat is what I found when I first got started. Even though I didn\u2019t start actually blogging until I had been at it for 64 days I had the intention to blog about it and was taking photos every day for that reason. My husband started the blog for me when he got home from working overseas. It sure helps to keep you focused when you have an audience to keep you honest. Than finding something to write about each day really got me thinking about the emotion behind the clutter. It all together opens your mind up and get you more ruthless about getting rid of stuff.\nI hope you have had a visitors today due to the mention. One thing I would like to see you do and another of my readers mentioned the same, is to add Name/Url and Anonymous to your comment identity choices. I was deterred from leaving a comment because I didn\u2019t like the ID choices available and so was my other reader.\nThere is a website called safelink.com that provides free cell phones(250 minutes a month) to those on certain State and Federal Assistance programs. The programs are listed on the site. You just fill out the form and click the box of the program with which you participate. It takes about two weeks for the phone to arrive. I guess this is US only, but there may be similar programs in other places. The food waste is very sad. \ud83d\ude41 Years ago when my Dad was well he used to use the Senior Center van and pick up bags of bread and pastries that would have been thrown out. I\u2019m not sure if they still do it, but I hope so!\nHi Lisa, that I can\u2019t pay my bill site looks very useful and as you say even if the links are only relevant to the US it gives people ideas to search for similar assistance in their own areas. And yes the food waste is sad. I know that in Australia there are organisations like Food Rescue that collect the day old stuff from restaurants etc and distribute it to those in need."
