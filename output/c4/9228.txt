    "text": "Very few things in life are written in stone, but the date of license suspension in a NJ Motor Vehicle Commission notice comes very close to being \u2018written in stone\u2019. If you get a letter from the MVC saying that they are going to suspend your license, consult immediately with an experienced criminal defense lawyer. There are often grounds that can be raised to reduce the period of suspension, but the procedure stated in the letter to get a hearing must be completed before the date listed for the suspension to begin. A suspension by the MVC is in addition to any suspension given to you by the Court.\nIf you have been notified that your driving privileges are being suspended by the NJ MVC, time is critical, consult with an experienced criminal defense lawyer before you decide whether to accept the suspension or request a hearing to fight it. Contact Howard Bailey at 973-982-1200 for a free consultation.\nIf you use your license on a daily basis to drive a vehicle, and there are no alternative public transportation facilities you can use, discuss these issues with the lawyer you consult with. These types of issues can be used as part of a defense to your license being suspended for the complete period of time listed in your suspension letter.\nIn a recent case, Howard Bailey was successful in getting a 39-month period of suspension for a fatality that occurred during a traffic accident reduced to a 9-month suspension. In another recent case involving a fatality during a traffic accident, Mr Bailey was able to get a 16-month suspension reduced to a 3-month suspension. By using the facts of the case and additional legal arguments, each client was able to get their privileges restored in a small fraction of the time they were originally going to be suspended.\nIs Your NJ Driver\u2019s License Worth Defending from Suspension?\nSome of the factors you need to consider are the length of the proposed suspension in the notice you received, your prior convictions in Municipal Court, and any prior notices you received from the MVC regarding your license. Only you can decide what your license is worth to you. If you are successful in getting a hearing before the Motor Vehicle Commission, you should expect that they will still want to suspend your license, even if it is for a reduced period of time. You do not have to accept the reduced period of suspension offered during the hearing, and can request that the case be heard by an Administrative Law Judge. What your license is worth to you, and how far you want to push to protect it is something you need to discuss with an experienced criminal defense lawyer.\nCall Howard Bailey at 973-982-1200 for a free consultation when the MVC is about to suspend your driver\u2019s license."
