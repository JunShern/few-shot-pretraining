    "text": "Italian's Insight to Travel Italy: Merry Christmas?\nThe Christmas traditions in Italy are varied from region to region as much as the food. From the feudal periods there were protector Saints, festivities, and celebrations that were the sum of the different cultures that had passed through the area over the years. Italy had conquered the world and been conquered by the world, immigrated and received immigration, been the birthplace of rulers and the favorite vacation retreat of some foreign king. Its traditions and culture are vast.\nItaly is also the center of the Roman Catholic Church. In 386 the Catholic Church became the church of state and began a process of dominating local rituals and celebrations thus incorporating existing festivities in Christian practices.\nToday what is considered \u201cChristmas\u201d in the US is not necessarily part of the Italian Christmas tradition. Additionally the US has exasperated the commercial aspect of the holiday, re-enforcing certain symbols, such as the Christmas tree and Santa Claus, that do not find correspondence in Italian tradition. That is not to say that no one has a Christmas Tree or that people have no idea of Santa Claus, just that they are not dominate symbols, and while the retail corporations do heavily advertise during the Christmas period the advertising is more good feeling, family, friends and food rather than the latest plastic robot or new car.\nInitially I felt cheated a bit at Christmas. I remembered Christmas as a child, the lights on every house, the music playing on every station, caroling with friends and just about every store promoting the holiday spirit. After a few years, I began to understand the Italian Christmas, I still wanted my Christmas tree but also saw the marvelous beauty of the nativity scenes. I never got over not having Santa Claus but did appreciate the folklore and tradition of Santa Lucia and the Befana. In fact I began to prefer the fact that gifts were exchanged on a different day than Christmas, leaving Christmas day to have family and close friends for a day of cooking, eating and exchanging good cheer.\nTo give my two cents on the current debate proceeding in the US about retailers attacking Christmas, the period from Thanksgiving to New Year\u2019s eve is the hottest retail period during the year. The things we associate with Christianity are not the things the people who live in the cradle of the Roman Catholic Church perceive as Christianity, but corporate America has created a perception, over the last 50 years, of what Christmas should entail. Today they want to call it the \u201choliday season\u201d because they feel it will open a greater addressable market.\nWhat a bunch of hypocrites, and we the consumer are gullible to get caught up in this discussion. If a store does not want to say \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d, it is not a place where I want to buy a Christmas gift. I can buy a holiday gift in a store that so adamantly expresses its desire of \u201cHappy Holidays\u201d and bans Santa Claus however, I forgot what day I am supposed to give the Holiday gift. More importantly, I do not know why I would exchange a Holiday Gift. For me it is Christmas, with all of the connotations of Christmas. I do not condemn corporate America\u2019s desire to \u201ccash in\u201d but for me, as a consumer, I want to buy things where my purchase is appreciated.\nI agree with your thoughts about the over-commercialization of Christmas as a Sales Event in the United States. It's also troubling that while 90% or more Americans do celebrate Christmas and want it acknowledged and not ignored, retailers trying to reach a larger audience, bury Christmas in favor or Holiday which could be Easter or St. Patrick's Day or St. Valentine's Day. As for Season's Greetings, I don't celebrate WINTER, I CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS! The very sorry thing is that the advertisements of retailers are driving the thoughts of many, to the point where when members of my Church's congregation sign the Church's Christmas Car,d which is printed in the Tidings Bulletin, by writing \"Happy Holidays\" and \"Season's Greetings\" instead of \"MERRY CHRISTMAS!\" Standing for tradition and values, I only utter \"Merry Christmas\" to ALL and write \"Keep Christ in Christmas\" as a reminder to the weak minded who hold no principles dear, even within the walls of the Church, God's House!\nFor those of you that question, \"But what if I offend someone by wishing them a Merry Christmas? What if they don't celebrate Christmas?\" YOU WON'T OFFEND! Do you celebrate your birthday, which is unique to you? Do you celebrate with friends or receive gifts or good wishes from family, friends, coworkers and sometimes even strangers (at a restaurant for example)? Do you worry about offending people whom you invite to celebrate your birthday and who share the joy of your special, meaningful day with you even though it's not their birthdate? No of course you don't worry! Many people share the joy of their Wedding Anniversaries, marked by celebrations with others who don't hold that date dear. Christmas is a time of GREAT JOY! It's a time of caring, sharing, giving, loving, goodness and kindness! It marks the birth of OUR Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ! The world needs more of this, not less! Don't be embarrassed of who you are and don't hide it. Greet people with Merry Christmas! Be in charge and set the tone for the weak minded followers who succumb to the hollow, empty cult message of happy holidays... which is a message of emptiness and really says NOTHING of any significance! You have a choice as a Christian each Christmas Season to stand with the Lord by greeting all with a JOYOUS, \"MERRY CHRISTMAS!\" and spread His goodness or to fall with the ignorant masses and perhaps INSULT YOUR LORD and SAVIOR. Did you ever question whether you would offend God by your actions and failure to acknowledge or mention his Son's name in a friendly greeting? A greeting of \"Merry Christmas\" should be viewed and RECEIVED by ALL recipients as a GIFT of JOY and PURE GOODNESS!\nIf you can't say Christmas, maybe you shouldn't celebrate it.\nMERRY CHRISTMAS, AND GOD'S BLESSINGS TO ALL!!!"
