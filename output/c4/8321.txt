    "text": "Australia is already feeling the pinch of economic and carbon transitions underway as the world inches closer to a climate agreement in Paris in December, 2015.\nOur Prime Minister has backed coal as a path of human prosperity right at the moment when coal is rapidly becoming anaethema due to the toxic affect of coal on human health (See CAHA: Coal and Health in the Hunter: Lessons from one valley for the world) and greenhouse gas pollution causing climate change.\nA report just released by Environment Victoria found that the social and health costs of coal in Victoria amounted to about $3.7 billion each year. Tom Arup and Adam Morton at the Age report on The hidden cost of the Hazelwood coal power plant. There is so much in cost being born by the taxpayer, while companies like GDF Suez, Energy Australia and AGL Energy rake in the profits, yet we can\u2019t manage to close a redundant, dirty, aging coal plant like Hazelwood.\nTo stave off transitional changes Abbott has endeavoured, and succeeded, in undermining Australia\u2019s renewable energy sector that has seen a plunge in investment to near zero and loss of jobs, just as the rest of the world expands renewables production faster than \u2018expert\u2019 growth predictions.\nThe abolition of the carbon tax has allowed energy generators to squeeze more profit out of their aging coal fired generators at the expense of soaring greenhouse gas emissions.\nThe USA \u2013 China climate deal has meant China is already acting to cap usage of coal, both to address the huge pollution problems and the social unrest that has been engendered, and the carbon pollution threat to increasing world temperatures.\nThis is not good news for Australia\u2019s expanding coal export industry. The Baird NSW State Government approved 1.366 tonnes of new coal mines in the six months before the NSW election. It is doubtful if they will all go ahead, and those that do will be at risk of becoming stranded assets due to the structural changes in coal demand due to climate change and it\u2019s health impacts.\nThe reduced steel production in China has also hit iron ore exports. The present mining boom is over,and we failed to capitalise on it by establishing a sovereign wealth fund, although such was opposed by the IPA along with carbon pricing and mining tax. Very short sighted.\nThe collapse of Australian mining export revenues has clearly caused budget problems for Treasurer Joe Hockey, but instead of seeking to structurally address these issues in a reasonable manner, he used the May 2014 budget to disenfranchise and reduce payments for some of those on the lowest incomes in Australia as well as slashing the Foreign Affairs budget by more than $11 billion.\nWe dearly need the carbon tax restored and the estimated $7 billion in revenue that would bring in, as well as slashing the $10 billion in Federal Government subsidies to fossil fuels each year, neither of which are on the agenda of the present government.\nAustralia was not one of the 32 countries that made the 31 March deadline submission of its post 2020 targets to the UNFCCC. But on 28th March a public consultations process was announced on Australia\u2019s post-2020 emissions reduction target. Submissions close 3pm AEST Friday 24 April 2015.\nAustralia\u2019s current emissions reduction target is 5 per cent on 2000 levels by 2020, although we still have a commitment under the UNFCCC to a range up to 25 per cent if certain conditions are met.\nOther Nations have already lodged questions about Australia\u2019s low ambitions and how it will meet it\u2019s commitments through the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate change (UNFCCC) process.\nA question from the European Union asked for information on how the anticipated mitigation potential of the Emissions Reduction Fund (ERF) could meet the more ambitous 15 per cent and 25 per cent targets that are part of our commitment range already made?\nForeign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop has resolutely stuck to this low level of ambition at the Climate summit in New York in September, 2014 where she was shunned. More recently she evaded a question on climate change and the risk to security when she attended Obama\u2019s 6th State of the Union (SOTU) Speech in January 2015.\nOur 5 per cent target is plainly inadequate when compared to what other nations are already undertaking. The Climate Change Authority in March, 2014 recommended that the conditions had been met to lift our 2020 targets to 15 per cent on 2000 levels. The Authority indicated that post-2020 domestic emission reduction targets of between 40% and 60% by 2030 would be required.\nThe Climate Institute recommended to the Climate Change Authority that Australian emissions reduction goals be 40 per cent below 2000 levels by 2025 and net zero emissions between 2040 and 2050.\nLenore Taylor in The Guardian highlights that the discussion paper does not even mention the 2C goal, first decided at Copenhagen in 2009 and confirmed at Cancun in 2010. But the issues paper does mention a scenario that could result in almost 4C global warming.\nCongrats Switzerland: #climate emissions cut by 50% on 1990 levels by 2030. https://t.co/TPC5KS7LGN How much Australia @JulieBishopMP?\nOvernight Europe announced an emissions reduction target of 40% by 2030 on 1990 levels http://t.co/qIjxPXOr2u Paris here we come!\nWhile the world is ramping up commitment to take action in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, Australia has just funded climate contrarian Bjorn Lomborg $4 million over the next four years to establish an Australian Consensus Centre at the University of Western Australia.\n@takvera great analysis and overview. I think Lomborg's sophistry will be key for Australia's inaction at Cop21. Might be strategy.\nIt is likely the Abbott Government will attempt to use the work of Lomborg\u2019s consensus centre to down play the necessity to mitigate climate change and to argue that Australia should have special consideration due to our heavy reliance on coal for electricity generation. Australia had a special consideration clause \u2013 it was even called the Australia clause \u2013 under the Kyoto Protocol, over land use and deforrestation emissions which made it much easier for us to meet our commitments.\nThis time round we might find other nations won\u2019t be so generous to allow any \u2018special consideration\u2019.\nSo what target do you think Australia should aim for? Read the white paper and make your Submission by 3pm AEST Friday 24 April 2015.\nUpdate: Submission deadline has now been extended to 1st May. John Englart prepared an 8 page formal submission on behalf of Climate Action Moreland.\nJohn Englart and his teenage daughter will be travelling to Paris to report on the United Nations COP21 climate talks (including for Nofibs), and in particular what role Australia plays in those negotiations. Over $1400 was successfully raised from 20 backers through crowdfunding to help meet their living costs while covering the climate talks."
