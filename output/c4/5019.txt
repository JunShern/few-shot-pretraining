    "text": "I took a little time off from blogging this winter and the time got away from me, to say the least. I hope I haven\u2019t worried anyone. We took a few trips since the first of the year and here it is mid April. I wanted all of you to know that all is well here at the Jensen house.\nWe have had our fair share of unusual winter weather events that has put our spring arrival about a month late. Normally at this time of the year I would be out in the garden house and yard hauling out pots and lugging garden soil to start planting\u2026not this year. We have had the coldest April in recorded history (and that says something for MN.) Last weekend we got 18\u2033 of snow, which also set a record for a spring snow event.\nAs I gazed out my front door at the never ending snowfall, I decided to head for my paints and canvases to paint flowers since I couldn\u2019t actually garden. I spent all weekend painting and created an indoor garden to satisfy my sprint planting urges. This week looks like the weather is going to turn the corner and actually act like spring so I will soon be outside \u201cdigging\u201d and not indoors painting.\nIt is also time to change out the quilts from winter to spring. The rooms all take on a whole new, fresh look with a lighter palette of fabrics. It is fun to take another look at quilts that have been stored for a while and appreciate not only the handiwork, but also the fun fabrics. I have always had pretty neutral background colors on the walls, beds and large upholstered pieces so I can easily change out the whole appearance of a room with accessories like paintings, quilts and pillows.\nThis all time favorite of mine (4-Patch Scrap Quilt) was featured in the Thimbleberries Block Party book.\nHello. I am trying to figure out which one of your quilt patterns is featured in a Thimbleberries book called Autumn Accents. Can you help, please?\nSorry, the picture did not show. Can you email it to me at lynette@thimbleberries.com and I can perhaps identify it.\nI am finally working my Pansy Park kit. Block #4 requires a 6\u00d721- inch piece wine floral. My kit contains a 4\u00d721 inch piece. Can anyone help me out? Thank you!!!\nSorry, I don\u2019t have any. Hopefully someone can help you out.\nHi Lori, I have a FQ of 4292-04 which is the wine floral with red and green floral. Do you need that or the tone-on-tone wine print w/ leaves?\nI live in Missouri and it is September now, I hope I haven\u2019t missed any blogs. I love your quilts and decorating. I have been ordering some of your books, I get so excited when they come in the mail. I am looking forward to hearing from you again,please leave me on your blog list.\nI miss your blog, patterns, and fabrics. I love that quilt, \u201c4 patch scrap quilt\u201d I have been slowly adding to the scrappy pile for that quilt; although, I have to admit it has to be Thimbleberries fabric only, to make this quilt. I have plenty in my Thimbleberries stash to make this quilt, just trying to use scraps from other Thimbleberries quilts, that I am making. You are the best! My first quilt by total accident, was one of your quilts (evergreen trees with checker board boarder) in a magazine, ThaNK GOODNESS, your directions are the best. I continued quilting because you made it so easy. THANK YOU LYNETTE!!!\nThanks for the note\u2026always nice to hear.\nForgive me if there is a better forum for this, but I\u2019m working on a project on the legacy of my grandmother, an avid baker and quilter. I have plans to print a book for my family members showing her recipes next to her quilts. She has a large number of Thimbleberries patterns, and I\u2019m looking for all the help I can find to identify and gather information about them that I could include under the photographs. I would appreciate help in that direction, even so far as to take a look at the handful of photographs I have that have been identified as Thimbleberries projects from the 200+ we found while clearing out her house.\nI am really not sure how to even begin. I designed hundreds of quilt project patterns and would have no idea how to identify without seeing the quilts, unless you want to send me the photographs and I try to identify just those. My email address is lynette@thimbleberries.com. It is a very sweet endeavor. Your grandmother would be so pleased that you all care so much about the passions in her life.\nHope all is good, was in Hutch lately and stopped at the local quilt store there. Will need to get back as didn\u2019t get all I saw and am sure will need someday.\nAll is good and Quilt Haven on Main in Hutch is still \u201chopping\u201d.\nHi Lynette! Do you remember what year that Thimbleberries Club originally started? One gal at my shop believes it was 1994 and one believes it was 1996 \u2013 who is correct?!?\nI think probably 2004. It\u2019s first year was very informal and it just got more and more involved each year.\nCatch me up-are you NOT designing fabrics anymore? That would be our loss. I always feel at home when I am quilting with your line. Maybe I am misreading what people are saying.\nI am not designing fabrics any longer. There has been a drastic change at the RJR fabric company and it just seems that it is time to put that part of my past to bed. My 27 years in the business was very rewarding and enjoyable and hopefully the years to come will be the same.\nWow! I love that quilt as well. So beautiful.\nWould you please put your recipe for Texas Cowboy cookies on your blog again. Lost my recipe. They are the best cookie.\nI guess I don\u2019t recall a Texas Cowboy Cookie recipe. I do have a Cowboy Chocolate Cookie one\u2026is that a it perhaps?\nI always look forward to seeing your beautiful yard, it was a feature in your books that I loved. Looks like you will be off to a late start this year. Your paintings are beautiful. Will they be appearing on fabric any time soon? Please!\nLove the old four patches,l backgrounds that go with everything and just the comfortable look.\nYour paintings are beautiful! Are you using oils or acrylics? I am a fellow Minnesotan, so I am looking forward to just seeing some green grass !\nI have been using acrylics and also trying my hand at watercolor. Painting is new for me, so every painting is a learning exercise, but very fun.\nToday, I am going to the Art in Bloom exhibit at the Minneapolis Institute for Art. It is a four day show that pairs paintings with floral arrangements.\nSeems like the perfect thing to do as I am still waiting for snow to melt on the north side of my house. Maybe by this weekend, I will be able to start working outside.\nEnjoy the exhibit \u2013 I am sure you will be inspired! I paint with acrylics mostly, but like to try new mediums. Maybe this summer I will give watercolors a try.\nHi Lynette, missed you! Glad everything is fine. Our Spring is 3 weeks behind in Ohio and yesterday I finally could start cleaning out the beds. The winter that never ends this year! The paintings are gorgeous. Can\u2019t wait to hear all about your spring plantings this year!\nI guess I did realize winter has been unkind everywhere. I am always grateful that I have so many things I love to do indoors, that the weather doesn\u2019t get me down.\nGlad to have you back. You were missed.\nI am so glad to hear all is well at the Jensen home! I was that you had stopped blogging for good, or that someone in the family was not well. It has been a very long winter season! The weather was warm and dry enough to get outside 4/21.\nI am excited that I found the gold print for Harvest Pinwheels from Classic Country 2000. I have all the fabrics laid out to bag for a quilt kit! I also finished kitting the Timeless Grace version of Crazy Puzzle quilt from Block by Block to Beautiful Quilts. Your patterns and fabrics continue to inspire many! Best wishes for a sunshine filled spring!\nI\u2019m so glad to hear from you. You have been missed and I admit I was a little worried. I\u2019m so glad you enjoyed some well deserved time off. I always enjoy your posts. I have been a Thimbleberries quilter for many years, started with quilters garden, and your patterns are always my go to. Wishing you a wonderful spring.\nBeautiful paintings, love the quilt!\nI was so excited to see that there was a new post to your blog today! I first discovered Thimbleberries at my LQS back in 2004. I was homeschooling my three children at that time so there was little time for quilting. I told myself then that when I started the next chapter of my life I wanted to quilt using Thimbleberries. That next chapter started for me last fall (2017). At first I was saddened to have missed out on the Thimbleberries clubs and such,but I have been having so much fun collecting your books, fabrics and patterns. Now I need to get busy sewing!\nI actually was getting a little worried, didn\u2019t know if you had decided to give up this post (heaven forbid!) or if it was something else. Glad to hear all is well in your household.\nI\u2019m in CT and I believe we had the coldest April ever recorded or close to it. We had snow a few times in April but nothing can top your snowfall!\nI love your flower paintings, your talent are never ending! I look forward to your post, please keep sharing with us everything you do. You are so inspiring!!\nPs: I especially love hearing anything you do with or for the grandchildren!\nWelcome back sure have missed you. Yes we all need a break now and then. Good to hear all is well in the Jensen family. It too has been a cold April lots of snow here in PA. Take care and thank you for all the good ideas, quilting patterns, beautiful fabrics and yummy reciepts.\nThank you for your newsletter. I have missed hearing from you. Hope all is well. The snow looked pretty incredible from here in sunny southern California. It looked beautiful. I would like to have 4 seasons. But as my mother, from ND, used to say if winter just didn\u2019t last so long. I enjoy your newsletter very much.\nYour painting are beautiful. I also love the quilt. What is the size of the squares that you put together to make the one square. You put 4 squares to make one square. Hope this is not confusing.\nThe squares are cut 2\u2033 and finished measure 1/2\u2033 with alternating 3\u2033 (finished) plain squares.\nWelcome back! I sure have missed you. Glad to hear the Jensen family is well. Looking forward to all things Thimbleberries. Bless you.\nYour quilts and paintings are Beautiful, you are so talented!\nGlad you posted a new blog and grateful we do not snow like you.\nSo good to hear all is well. Beautiful paintings and quilt. Blessings to you and your family.\nWould love to see your painting transferred into fabric designs.\nLynette, I so like your newly painted pictures! I am honored to know such a multi-talented person. Happy planting!\nSo good to hear from you, Lynette! Your paintings are lovely. I live in New Jersey, and the winter has been dreadful. We are finally seeing flowering trees!\nIt\u2019s ironic that you should feature the 4-patch Scrap Quilt! A friend and I are going to make this quilt together, only virtually, since she lives in Central Oregon and I now live in north Washington State. I still have a lot of Thimbleberries fabrics so I will have no problem stitching this lovely quilt!\nThose paintings are lovely. You are a very multitalented lady!\nI love the gestural loose paintings of the flowers, and I see those colour influences in your quilts. How beautiful! I live in northern British Columbia, and I hate to tell you this, but my Iceland poppies are already greening up \u2013 always my first plants of the season. Spring WILL come!\nSounds like you had Alaska weather We are ready for spring.\nI have LOVED Thimbleberries for many years. I remember going to the local quilt shop with a picture of \u201cThe Thimbleberries Book of Quilts\u201d saying \u201cdo you have this\u201d? I was so excited to get this book! I still have my book and many, many more\u2026a collection of Thimbleberries I think! You continue to inspire and I just wanted you to know that my house is so much prettier thanks to you. Have a great day!\nI love your quilts and have made several. Your directions are the best. I always hand quilt my quilts. I\u2019m not the best but as my son said years ago, \u201cmom it will mean so much more if you hand quilt it\u201d. So I\u2019m wondering, do you ever hand quilt?"
