    "text": "I think this YoTube video demonstrates how to groom a Havanese dog the right way as well as how to cut Havanese hair. Not only that it also shows how to do it with maximize comfort for you as well as the dog.\nClipping faces, in particular around the eyes, is always tricky. This video provides a good demo of grooming Havanese face hair as well as how to groom the back, belly, tail and paws.\nYou can see from the video that the groomer suggests a full groom every 2 to 3 months. You just need to look past the ads in the video to see how valuable the content is.\nThis little Havanese is a sheer delight to watch, so affectionate but most importantly absolutely at ease with being clipped. Well, at least until it came to nail clipping and I don\u2019t know any dog that is entirely okay about having their toe nails trimmed. But the groomer manages this task as well as the other grooming tasks. She uses a harness which keeps the dog in position without adding to any discomfort whatsoever.\nhow to keep Havanese hair from matting in particular the ears.\nThis little Havanese boy dog looks truly handsome by the end of his clipping and grooming.\nI\u2019m sure you would agree that having a harness makes all the difference. The groomer in the video would not have been able to keep her doggy client relatively still for the length of the session without it.\nUsed blunt clippers won\u2019t \u201ccut it\u201d when it comes to managing nail clipping. Make sure you have a good quality pair.\nThe type of grooming table you choose will depend on whether you are simply doing your own grooming at home or managing a busy dog grooming salon professionally. If the former, you can find a selection here that might offer what you are looking for.\nThis video shows a groomer working (in silence) with the cutest of little puppies. I\u2019m sure you will agree the end result is ever so handsome.\nUntil next time, have fun with your gorgeous Havanese dog, adult or puppy."
