    "text": "Dortmund is located in the north-west of Germany, close to Cologne and Bonn. It is home to several breweries (which are open for tours and visits), and there are various facilities for climbing, cycling and canoeing; so it is an ideal visit for active people. There are four medieval churches in the city, and there are a selection of walking tours which visitors can participate in to see the sights of Dortmund.\nFor those into their sport, a visit to the home of the sport club Borussia Dortmund may be of interest. They have won both the UEFA Champions League and the Intercontinental Cup in recent years.\nDortmund Airport is primarily a domestic airport, although there are some flights to and from a few major European destinations."
