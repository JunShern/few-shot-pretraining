Some sites talk about a Guarantee but if you read their fine print you'll discover cancellation fees and/or that your paying them an additional fee indirectly by way of them receiving a hefty referral fee from a realtor who you are required to hire is a condition to their guarantee.\nWe are so confident that our Guarantee below is the BEST available on the Internet that we will give you a FREE FSBO ad if you can find another site with a Written Guarantee as good as ours or EVEN CLOSE. Just call us if you think you have found one and we will show you where to find their FINE PRINT.\nSell Your Home - List Now!\n1. This Money-Back Guarantee applies ONLY to a real property Owner who purchases FSBOAdvertisingService.com's \"Until Sold Standard Internet Ad\" (Our Product Code A4 will be included on your order confirmation for this item) after August 15, 2003 and while this guarantee is posted on this page to advertise real property they hold legal title to in the USA. Only ONE such ad per owner may be subject to this guarantee and it only applies to Owners making a Bona-Fide offer of their property for SALE (i.e. someone offering their property for sale just to generate leads of some kind or conduct research will not qualify for this guarantee since the property is not REALLY offered for sale, also property listed for rent or actually rented during the term of the ad does NOT qualify for this money-back guarantee) who are NOT a licensed real estate agent, mortgage, or note broker. A qualifying party is referred to as the SELLER.\n2. This Money-Back Guarantee applies ONLY to an Until Sold FSBO Ad of a SELLER which a) is continuously ACTIVE (i.e. the SELLER does not pause or cancel the ad) and continuously meets all the other standards stated in this section 2 for a period of 190 days from the date said ad was placed and b) includes 5 reasonable quality photos of the property advertised (to be added within 10 days of listing) and c) the Optional Information section of the ad has been reasonably completed including the street name and address (to be completed within 10 days of listing) and d) accurately describes the single property which is being offered for sale (you can not advertise a condo and offer a mobile home for example) and e) the SELLER contact information is and remains continuously valid (at least one phone number and one email address, the email address does remain private using our privacy feature but must be and remain valid). An ad meeting these standards is herein a QUALIFIED ad. Email us after your ad is completed and we will Certify for your records that items b and c are fine.\n3. We will refund to SELLER the FULL PURCHASE PRICE of the ONE QUALIFIED Until Sold ad purchased within 30 days of receipt of a written request (addressed to FSBO Advertising Service, Inc at P.O. Box 517, Bellaire, TX 77402) from the SELLER of said QUALIFIED ad in the event that a) the advertiser is a SELLER entitled to this guarantee and b) the SELLER has used due diligence to sell the property advertised and c) the ad is and was continuously for 180 days a QUALIFIED ad and d) the 190 day period beginning on the date the QUALIFIED ad was purchased has expired and the property advertised remains unsold and is not under contract. The SELLER shall certify that items a through d are the circumstances in their request for refund and include a copy of their order confirmation which states the guarantee applicable at the time of their order (IF you sign and return the order confirmation to us at the time your order is placed then you do NOT need to return it again if you later request a refund). IF we are uncertain about the validity of the request then we shall be entitled to request that the SELLER provide us a title report dated on or after the end of the 190 day period documenting that the SELLER remains the owner of record of the advertised property prior to our processing the refund.\n4. The refund request must be received at the address above no earlier than 190 days after the listing was placed and no later than 220 days after the date the listing was placed.\n5. THIS LIMITED WARRANTY IS INTENDED TO BE AND SHALL BE EXCLUSIVE AND INSTEAD OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND ANY AND ALL OTHER WARRANTIES NOW OR HEREAFTER ALLOWED BY ANY LAW. WE ARE NOT AND SHALL NOT BECOME LIABLE FOR ANY OTHER ITEM OF COST OR EXPENSE OR LIABILITY INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT OR SPECIAL DAMAGES, WHETHER OR NOT SUCH DAMAGES ARE BASED UPON TORT, CONTRACT, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR OTHER CLAIMS OF ANY KIND OR CHARACTER.

This Flat Fee MLS Upgrade Guarantee applies to any FSBOAdvertisingService.com advertiser a) whose property is located in a geographic area which we offer the Hybrid FSBO-MLS Listing package which includes the Realtors Flat Fee MLS listing service and b) who has an active FSBO ad with FSBOAdvertisingService.com. A qualifying party for this UPGRADE guarantee section is referred to as an ADVERTISER. The UPGRADE Guarantee is NOT LIMITED to the Until Sold ad like the MONEY BACK Guarantee is.\n2. An ADVERTISER may, upon written request (addressed to FSBO Advertising Service, Inc at P.O. Box 517, Bellaire, TX 77402), elect to UPGRADE their FSBO Ad to the HYBRID FSBO-MLS Listing package on the terms and at the price which such package is then available at FSBOAdvertisingService.com for the geographic location of their advertised property and we shall credit the FULL PURCHASE PRICE of their then active FSBO ad towards the purchase price of the selected Hybrid FSBO-MLS package. The ADVERTISER shall include a check or credit card authorization for the ADDITIONAL FEE due (the amount of the ADDITIONAL FEE shall be the price of the Hybrid FSBO-MLS Listing package price LESS the amount paid for ADVERTISERS then active FSBO ad) along with the fax/mail in order form for the HYBRID FSBO-MLS package along with their UPGRADE REQUEST. You can print those order forms on the pages which describe the terms of the Flat Fee MLS service for your area or call us and we can email or fax them to you.\n3. The UPGRADE ELECTION and payment must be received at the address above no later than 3 days after the expiration date of the ADVERTISERS FSBO ad.\n4. ADVERTISER'S EXERCISING THIS OPTION SHALL TERMINATE THE MONEY-BACK GUARANTEE OPTION ABOVE IF THE AD UPGRADED WAS COVERED BY THE MONEY BACK GUARANTEE.\nWe do reserve the right modify or discontinue offering this or any guarantee at any time without notice. However, such a change will NOT affect the terms of the guarantee applicable at the time of your purchase. YOUR online order confirmation will include a complete copy of the guarantee in effect at the time of your purchase (if any), EXACTLY AS PRINTED ON THE PAGE ABOVE AT THE TIME YOUR ORDER IS PLACED, so please print that order confirmation page out for your records.
