    "text": "The Small Diameter Bomb II, an air-dropped weapon brining a new generation of precision targeting and attack technology, is now more fully integrating to F-35s and other aircraft. The SBD II brings integrated seeker systems to include semi-active laser technology, millimeter wave guidance, RF guidance and infrared heat seeking sensor targeting. The SBD II is also capable of essentially \u201ctracking\u201d moving targets, changing course in flight and hitting targets at ranges out to 40-miles. In development for several years now, the SBD II is fast-entering new stages of testing, early production and integration on various aircraft.\nThe Pentagon's 2020 budget request asks for more than 3,000 more Hellfires and $200 million more than last year; the request also asks for 7,000 more Small Diameter Bomb IIs compared to last year.\nAdditional Hellfire uses are bringing a substantial strategic and tactical change for the military services. Adding Hellfires to Navy Littoral Combat Ships makes the vessel much more lethal at shorter and medium ranges. With its guidance technologies and range, it brings a strong counter-air dimension to both ship defense and ship attack. Hellfires could be fired at enemy drones, helicopters and low-flying aircraft in maritime environments. Naturally this could defend against, defer or counter attacks, but it could also target enemy sub-hunting helicopters, unmanned vessels and sonobuoy-dropping helicopters. It is a medium range weapons which brings offensive attack possibilities, expanding beyond the LCS' shorter range deck-mounted guns. It gives the LCS and improved standoff range for land attack at medium distances and also fortifies a blue water combat ability.\nOn land, bringing vertically-fired counter drone weapons to Stryker vehicles is a substantial added war feature. Short Range Air Defense, or SHORAD, is already arming a wide number of Strykers, bringing back the Cold-War emphasized need for medium range counter air. This not only gives a Stryker the ability to track and destroy enemy drone attacks, but also enables counter helicopter attacks and even intercept ability of some incoming enemy munitions. As one senior leader put it to Warrior Maven, land combat air and missile defense had \"atrophied\" during the 15-years of counterinsurgency in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nAlso, as part of this, there are also two broad often discussed trends. The first is that, given the persistent scope of attacks on ISIS in recent years, there has been an overall ammunition stockpile shortage. For example, in recent years the Air Force has made rapid moves to increase its stockpile of laser-guided rockets, 2.75 inch Hydra Advanced Precision Kill Weapons System. Secondly, the Air Force in particular is now making a massive push to modernize its arsenal of air-dropped bombs - with much of this falling under the R&D proposed increase.\nIm sorry but whoever wrote this artice has no idea what they are talking about.\nHellfire offers very very little S2A capability. Maybe a helicopter, but thats about it. The hellfire on MSHORAD will mostly be used as an antitank missile. Remember the units equipped with Stryker are very limited in antitank capability at this point. Also the hellfires on the new MSHORAD are NOT vertically launched (google it). And they offer NO medium range capability but very short range. An air launched hellfire has at max 7km range. Easily take 30-50% off this range for a surface launched hellfire. Couple miles max. Just a little longer range than a Javilin.\nAll this talk of Hellfire providing LCS with medium range S2A capability is completely 100% groundless. The hellfires are 100% for small attack capability and are very short range. Hellfire does not have near the maneuverability for S2A attack. That will be the function of RAM. Whose range is 10X Hellfire (and price also unfortunately)."
