    "text": "Part of a series of helpful hints for campers to make life more enjoyable in New Zealand's great outdoors.\nThere is no longer a need to sleep rough when you go camping, nowadays you can find almost any type of bed to fit inside all sizes of tents and campers. The most deluxe beds used for camping are frame beds that keep you off the ground. There are many benefits of these types of beds, including that your mattress won\u2019t get damp and it is easier to climb in and out of bed. Frame beds can come in all sizes from king to slim singles, including deluxe bunks and jumbo sized stretcher beds. Bunk beds are a good idea for families because they are space efficient, and you can purchase bunks with safety rails to prevent any unwanted rolling out of bed.\nAirbeds can be used on some frame beds, or if you prefer no frame then you can purchase double high air beds that will also keep you raised off the ground. Many good quality airbeds have built-in pumps for easy inflation and deflation. These also come in a range of sizes, and some good quality beds have velour covers for extra comfort.\nSelf inflating mats are the next option. These are also very easy to use as you only have to turn the cap to let air in, and then roll to deflate. These are a slightly more luxurious option than bed rolls because they provide extra insulation, and they are easy to pack away if space or storage is an issue. Inflatable mats are also lightweight, so a good option when tramping or cycling.\nIf you still prefer to rough it, then there is a huge selection of quality foam bedrolls available from good New Zealand outdoor stores.\nSleeping bags are the next important item on the camping list. A good quality sleeping bag will make all the difference to your camping experience, providing you with warmth and comfort in the coldest environments or keeping you comfortable in warmer months. Duck down or Goose Down is the best material for cooler outdoor climates and winter use, but can be expensive. Today synthetic sleeping bags are designed for a greater range of temperatures, from winter through to summer months.\nLook for a quality sleeping bag that is tapered at the foot end and provides a hood for your head. If you are camping in extreme environments check with your camping store about your sleeping bag\u2019s temperature range.\nWe hope these tips help you. Most of all we hope you enjoy your camping experience in New Zealand\u2019s great outdoors!\nFor more information about camping equipment visit the Kiwi Camping website, they stock retailers with a large range of camping products and boast 24 years of tent and camping gear development."
