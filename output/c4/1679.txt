    "text": "Please tell us why you believe your group is qualified to carry out this project.\n- How long has your group been established?\n- What skills and experience do you have?\nRichard is a plant specialist and has studied and maintained varieties of plants and wildlife for over 40 years. Enzo is a hands-on worker who creates small-scale construction plans with accuracy. Mario consistently maintains deadlines to get repairs done and has experience in residential landscaping improvement. All group members have a passion to improve the appearance, function, and presence of native plants in the community, and have been working toward this goal together for over 2 years.\n- What are the expected outcomes/results?\n- What is the estimated size of the pollinator garden(s)?\n- When will your project start and end?\n- For school projects, has the school approached you requesting the project or will you be reaching out to them with your idea?\nOutcome: To create habitats that serve as rain gardens and are attractive to pollinators, and engage community residents by encouraging participation.\nTo create a coldframe, where pollinator and rain garden plants can be germinated and given to community members.\nSize: The garden will span the entire front yard of each 3 properties. Our project will start as soon as funding is released. It will end 12 months later as it will be an established habitat for pollinators and rain garden by that time, and after that will only require seasonal maintenance, to be carried out by 'Mulock Ave' group members and any community members who wish to help.\nPlease list the steps you will take to organize and deliver your project.\n1. Create a Garden Plan with sun/shade considerations for each plant, with note of soil types required for each plant, and determine if the plant will be an effective attraction to pollinators, and create a rain garden. Each plant will be placed in an area with its own optimal conditions.\n2. Find source of each plant and determine what is available.\n3. Evaluate land and determine what needs to be done to achieve the Garden Plan. This may include moving rocks, patio stones, shrubs to make better use of space.\n4. Prepare the land for the plants. This would include digging soil, amending soil among other things.\n5. Obtain and plant the pollinator and rain garden plants. This will be done as early as possible in the Summer season to ensure the plants grow and establish themselves.\n6. Dig area for the germination coldframe. Install a durable coldframe and secure it in the soil approximately 1' below ground level, ensuring it is accessible to community members and receives an adequate amount of sunlight to germinate plants.\n7. Provide continuing support for members to propagate and learn about native plants, pollinator plants and rain gardens.\nPlease tell us how you plan to keep your garden functioning as pollinator habitat.\n- What is the maintenance plan for the garden?\n- For school gardens, how will the garden be maintained over the summer months?\n- Who is responsible for the long term success of the project?\nMaintenance Plan: for Mulock Ave group members to maintain, prune, clear away dead brush as needed, collect seeds and propagate plants as needed. There will be two major maintenance events each year (spring, fall) and minor maintenance carried out between those times. The Mulock Ave group is responsible for the long term success, and are local residents who currently maintain the area on a daily basis.\nPlease tell us how will your project engage and educate community.\nFor school gardens - how will your project engage teachers and students at the school, but also the larger community?\nThe Mulock Ave group will encourage the public to collect seeds and propagate plants from the pollinator and rain garden, learn the importance of these plants and how to take care of them. The Mulock Ave group will do this by using word-of-mouth, telling neighbors in the area, and may also form a web presence as a forum for community discussion about the pollinator and rain garden and its benefits. The documentation of the Mulock Ave Gardens will be made publicly available online to be updated quarterly. It will include pictures and updates on health and needs of the individual plants in the garden.\nFill in the budget template below.\nRemember to look at the list of Eligible Project Costs on the program website.\nWhere the dollar amount is unknown, please estimate the amount to the best of your ability.\n5. Maintenance Plan \ufffd a description of how the garden(s) will be cared for and who is responsible for the long term success of the project."
