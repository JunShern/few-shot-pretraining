    "text": "Col John R. Bourgeois (USMC Ret.) will host his annual Picnic at his house in Washington, VA on September 14 from 12:00pm until whenever he kicks us out. This is an important event for the association. We will get the year off to a wonderful start in what promises to be an exciting and important year for the DCAAA. Hope to see you all there. Carpools will be available.\nSaturday October 19, 2013 \"National Walk for Wounded Warriors\"\nThis will go from the Lincoln Memorial around the reflecting pool, and there will be some sort of marching band competition at the same time. Again we're looking for 5-10 volunteers. If you are in the military we are looking to form a team to actual participate in the walk (it's free to register), and are coming up with an excellent t-shirt design for this.\nIn an effort to promote more musical and service events this year, we are teaming up with an organization called Beethoven Found. Their mission is \"Music Supporting Wounded Warriors & Other Charities.\" Some other charities include giving musical instruments to needy schools and children. We are currently working with them on two upcoming events detailed below. For both events we need volunteers to work the event, and I told them we could provide 5-10 people (between 4 chapters/associations this should be EASY).\nThursday Sept 12, 2013 \"Funk Symphony Benefit Concert\"\nBootsy Collins is performing with full orchestra to raise money for charity. Details are on the first attachment to this email \"Bootsy Flyer 9-12\" As mentioned, we would like to provide 5-10 brothers to volunteer their time, (as ushers, working the information booth, whatever). In addition to this, if anyone would like to attend you can buy tickets through the Beethoven Found link below (same info as attached flyer), or straight from Strathmore's website. The other flyer is sponsorship opportunities which provide you with a private box and I think a chance to meet Bootsy after the concert.\nWe will be holding officer elections on Friday July 26th, at brother Chris Sexton's house in Manassas. It will be followed by our social, in his & Brian's Speakeasy!! Please refer to previous emails for the officer nominations. We will be taking nominations from the floor also. Please note there are two different candidates for Secretary: Nathan St Pierre, and John A Davis. We will be starting at 7:30, however if that seems too early for brothers to get there, that can be pushed back. You don't have to be on time if you are not voting, but just coming to the social.\nTo be a voting member you must be a dues paying member. Otherwise you can discuss, but not actually vote.\nIt is that time of year to announce that the Dues for the DC Area Alumni Association are due by June 1, 2013. They are $75 and payable via our website, under the \"Resources\" tab on the left side of the page. These dues will cover June 1, 2013-May 31, 2014. Thanks for your continued support of your Alumni Association, and we look forward to hosting more great events for everyone to come to in the coming year.\nSunday April 28th, at 2pm, in Dover, DE. Carpools can be arranged. There is an 'event' on our facebook group that you can RSVP to. We would love to make a BIG presence at this!\nCome join us for a St. Patrick's Day Celebration at PG Jeff Hoffman's house in Falls Church on March 17th from 3 PM - 6 PM!"
