    "text": "Posted on May 20, 2016 by Elizabeth E.\nTo introduce my newest goal, I need to talk about my new pattern covers. I made them in a new software I\u2019m trying to learn, Affinity Photo, fearful that any day my upgrades on my Mac will render my old copy of Photoshop more obsolete than it already is. And no, I don\u2019t want to pay a monthly fee to use their software (are you listening, Adobe?) I just heard that Affinity Photo is launching a beta version for PC users, too, although it was developed as a Mac software. So this is the first of my summer goals.\nThey also have Affinity Designer, which I\u2019m also trying to learn, but since I don\u2019t know Adobe\u2019s Illustrator very well, it\u2019s like banging my head against a wall. When my friend recovers from getting her daughter married off, I\u2019m going to bug ask her to teach me a few things.\nTo keep reading is another summer goal, and this was the latest book I finished, while quilting up a few things for my Riverside Sawtooth post. It set me down so carefully in time and place. No, it\u2019s not a grip-you-by-the-throat novel, but a quiet one, filled with well-drawn characters from a time in our past. I listened to it on Audible, which I would recommend, as the narrator really gets the sound of the voices and it adds another dimension to the story, I think.\nCan I mention Summer Events? Here\u2019s about the only political statement I\u2019ll make on this blog: we recently (and sadly) lost our ability to have a primary election here in California. We\u2019d all been so excited, actually asking everyone \u201cwho are you going to vote for?\u201d and really getting interested in politics in general. We are one of the final primaries on the Presidential Election Schedule, and for once, we were going to Have a Say! Except now we aren\u2019t, because of the recent events (which has made great theater, I have to say). So, hope everyone else in the United States had a great time voting\u2013as usual, our votes won\u2019t count. H o w e v e r. . . I will be watching the conventions. After teaching Critical Thinking a few years, and having my students watch the conventions and have them analyze the speeches, the rhetoric, looking for the logical fallacies and spotting all the weakness in candidates\u2019 arguments, I wouldn\u2019t miss it for the world. It\u2019s going to be a long, hot summer out here, and hey! we need something to compensate us for not getting a Primary Election.\nAnd it that\u2019s not enough excitement (!), we can always watch the Brazil Summer Olympics, although with all the talk lately, it may end up being like our primary. Click on the link at the end of the post to see this colorful Olympics design in action.\n1. Finish My Small World.\n5. Finish this quilt top, and if possible get it quilted, too.\n6. And\u2026 this one, too.\nI am all done with the hand-stitching. Now just to figure out the borders, and get it quilted.\nEasy, peasy. We are coming right along in our Quilt-a-Long, with Step 5 coming up on June 2nd.\n7. Be a good citizen and follow the national political process. Every other week ought to be about right.\n8. Visit my kids and their kids. And my parents. And my husband\u2019s family. That\u2019s about eight car trips right there. I\u2019d better work on #4\u2013if only to have some hand sewing for car travel.\n9. Celebrate my one-year anniversary of recovering from my surgery. I think a night in front of the TV would be appropriate, in my nightgown with hand-sewing on my lap, to memorialize where I was last year at that time.\n10. And oh, yeah. Vote in California\u2019s Primary. I\u2019m so excited, yes yes yes.\nPosted on October 20, 2015 by Elizabeth E.\nWhile I really love the festive cookies sold during Germany\u2019s Oktoberfest, it\u2019s the giant pretzels I really miss.\nAnd who can forget the cute dirndls, wore by the most traditional Bavarian women? (I have three, all made by hand with fabric lugged home from Munich.) But in honor of those weeks of partying they do in the Bavarian Alps, I\u2019ve been partying here in my sewing room, finally gaining enough stamina to put in nearly a full day\u2019s/several days\u2019 worth of work. In other words, it\u2019s catch-up time.\nA package of blocks from our Traveling Threads Bee finally caught up to me (we\u2019ve had some delays) and I placed Amber\u2019s blocks (she blogs at One Shabby Chick) all over my design wall to admire the handiwork of my beemates. So often when I get a batch of blocks, I recognize that there is a different goal for those of us at the end of the bee. Those at the beginning work on creating blocks and filling up the holes. But if you are towards the end of the trading circle, a good look at the quilt is necessary, asking: what does this quilt need? In this case, it needs some negative space, the hint given by that lone six-pointed appliqu\u00e9 star there on the turquoise background.\nThe theme of this quilt is \u201cI love you more than all the stars,\u201d with the request to make pink stars on a range of blue backgrounds. Amber also included this really cool lame cotton, which of course I couldn\u2019t wait to use. I kept singing the lyrics to Good Morning, Starshine in my head, and realized that\u2019s where I needed to go. So above, are three starshine blocks.\nI tucked them in around the edges of the quilt, pronounced it done, packed it up and mailed it off to the next partner in our bee.\nAfter two years of saving a few Halloween-themed Polaroid blocks, I pulled them out and put them into a random bordered square arrangement. While I should be working on Halloween in March, or even April, I never feel like working on Halloween then.\nThis, along with my basket quilt and another quilt Lisa and I finished for a friend, are now at the quilter\u2019s. Yes, I\u2019ll enjoy my Halloween quilt NEXT Halloween.\nHowever I promised her we wouldn\u2019t start on it until after the holidays, so the fabrics are stashed away until January.\nAnd I\u2019ve made it up to T/t on my Quilt Abecedary project (T/t were too shy to pose for a photo). Only a few more, then I\u2019ll need to start really honing in on the theme of my quilt and what I want my Spelling Bee-mates to make for my quilt. I\u2019m first up in January, so I\u2019d better get cooking.\nAnd then after that finishes next year, I\u2019m game to do another traveling bee. And then after that. . .\nIt\u2019s nice to be looking far forward once again, rather than just hoping I can make it through a day at a time. I used to do quarterly goals for several online finishing collaborations, but have fallen out of the habit of looking ahead, bogged down as I was in this summer\u2019s detritus of the here and now. I still don\u2019t fill up my schedule book too far ahead, not knowing if my stamina will hold out.\nAnd does it really help to focus on your goals? We\u2019ll never quell that controversy, but according the article, How Goals and Good Intentions Can Hold Us Back on the 99u blog, focusing exclusively on your goals may \u201cspoil your experience of the activities you\u2019ll need to pursue.\u201d Even the first article linked above notes that \u201crelentless fantasizing may actually reduce one\u2019s odds of achieving goals.\u201d But, rather, \u201cadopting the mind-set that your strengths and abilities are not fixed, but can improve over time and with effort, can have self-fulfilling results\u201d (99u \u2014 always a good site for reading about this sort of thing).\nFor this reason, I\u2019ve found often that reviewing my achievements often provides motivation to go forward, a sort of \u201cI finished that one, now I can finish this\u201d one sort of process. Or I can say to myself, \u201cI like the feeling of having completed this,\u201d and enjoy the feeling like when I walked out of the post office yesterday, having mailed off a bee-mate\u2019s package of blocks.\nbut don\u2019t forget to. . .\nPosted on July 12, 2013 by Elizabeth E.\nIt\u2019s that time again, time to set out some goals for the next quarter. The rules state that they have to be projects that you need to finish, and since I\u2019ve been laid up with a foot surgery this summer, I\u2019m repeating some of the projects from last go-round, that still need to be finished.\nThe repeaters are the Hunter\u2019s Star (really, it\u2019s so close. . . yet so far), the Lollypop Tree quilt, and the Friendship Quilt. The Lollypop Tree will require me to be all the way healthy, so I\u2019m not even sure I should put it on this quarter\u2019s list, but I certainly don\u2019t want it bumping into the next, where holiday fun things take time away from quilting. So here it is.\nNew to this list is my Four-in-Art quilt for August 1st\u2019s reveal and while I\u2019d like to add on November\u2019s Art Quilt to this one, it\u2019s not started yet. You know the rules. I am also making up a little quilt with citrus colored fabrics that Laurel brought to me post-op (to cheer me up), and I\u2019ve had fun making the stars (it\u2019s also a Schnibbles quilt).\nI\u2019m also making a quilt with Anne\u2019s Design, from SpringLeaf Studios\u2013the Facets quilt is so intriguing and so fun. She provides multiple ideas for you to create; this is just one of them.\nFor the first time, I\u2019m including two handmades on the FAL list, as I see that this is a possibility in the FAL Universe. I\u2019ve had the pieces cut out forever to make this Pleated Tote out of Keiko Goke fabric. Time to finish it up. Likewise Hot Mitts for Rhonda\u2013fabric pinned early in June, but not yet completed. It\u2019s awaiting quilting and construction. Time to get that out of the sewing room and off to Rhonda (it was her birthday present\u2013which was last month\u2013!).\nAnd that\u2019s the beauty of Finish-A-Long (FAL): to get things finished and done and out of the sewing room, as Leanne says. Join up with your goals *here* at She Can Quilt, and get some of your projects finished!"
