With a finished basement, you can add a great place for entertaining, expand your living space, or even add another bedroom. But as with beginning any renovation, it\u2019s important to have a plan to avoid missteps during construction. You may face several challenges in the process of finishing your basement, which can make the renovation a daunting task. Here are some of our helpful tips for avoiding some common pitfalls that many homeowners face during the process of finishing a basement.\nWhen it comes to finishing your basement, you want to be sure that the basement is safe from flooding and water damage. Jumping straight into a basement finishing project without getting a better idea of your basement\u2019s vulnerability to leaks is an easily avoidable mistake. Be sure to inspect your basement windows, corners, and doorways for moisture and leaks. When you\u2019re aware of the areas of your basement that are vulnerable to potential water damage and flooding, you can correct leaks and cracks before getting started on remodeling your basement.\nYou\u2019ll also want to make sure your basement is properly insulated before starting your project. If your basement is not properly insulated, you won\u2019t be able to enjoy your new living space comfortably. Good foam insulation can keep your finished basement a comfortable temperature all year round, and it can also help protect your basement in case of leaks. Foam insulation will be able to stand up better to moisture than the alternatives. Even if you thoroughly inspect your basement and are sure to fix any cracks or leaks in the structure, it\u2019s important to be sure that you\u2019re protected in case of any leaks or flooding.\nFinally, you don\u2019t want to make the mistake of using sub-par materials to finish your basement. Be sure to use durable flooring and wall materials in order to make sure your basement is comfortable and can stand up to the drafts and leaks that can crop up in many basements. Don\u2019t forget to use strong insulation under the floors as well as behind the walls. This will help you keep your basement dry and comfortable.\nCALL CYPRESS CONSTRUCTION TODAY FOR YOUR BASEMENT REMODEL!\nThis entry was posted on Monday, March 11th, 2019 at 12:18 pm.
