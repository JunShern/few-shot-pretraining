    "text": "Time for the holidays! Whether you enjoy this time of year, or can\u2019t wait for it to be over \u2013 it can be difficult.\nIf you or someone you know is having a hard time this holiday, please be sure to share with someone. If you don\u2019t know anyone that you want to share with- there are many confidential resources out there, by phone, text, or email.\nRemember that you are not alone. There are many who are willing to listen and help.\nOur first exhibition is currently up in Downtown Minneapolis at the AIM Gallery at 15 south 9th Street, Minneapolis, through November 13.\nPlease join us on November 6 for a reception, open from 5:00- 6:30 pm. We will be sharing stories submitted by participants in the project at 6:00 pm.\nAlso, our Open Call is ongoing- please feel free to still contribute an image of a Memorial. Thank you!\nOn June 22, Our Saviour\u2019s Lutheran Church in Minneapolis invited The 8030 Project to hold a workshop for creating Memorials of 22, concurrent with an art show featuring work created by Veterans in the Arts. The work was very moving; 12 pillars created by 12 veterans. The pieces combined text and collage, sharing experiences from war and life after war, also looking to the future.\nThe 8030 workshop sparked conversation, and participants created memorials inside as well as outside. Thank you to everyone who participated.\nMore images coming soon, as the wifi is slow in rural Michigan, where I am through next week. I wanted to share something before the 4th of July, as my thoughts are with those who have returned recently.\nTo all: have a happy, and restful, Fourth of July.\nWe are requesting the U.S. House Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs launch an investigation with public hearings into the link between psychiatric drugs and the epidemic of veteran suicides, \u201csudden deaths\u201d and the mass violence of the recent Fort Hood and Navy Yard shootings (both taking prescribed psychiatric drugs)."
