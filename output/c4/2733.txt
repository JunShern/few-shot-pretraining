    "text": "We are grateful for our wonderful patients. We are proud to share a few of the hundreds of unsolicited testimonials!\n1I was very pleased with my vists to PT PROFESSIONALS. Our therapist listened to my concerns and worked out a therapy program that I felt comfortable with and that brought about very satisfying results. He also printed out an instruction sheet with pictures demonstrating the exercises, they were especially helpful. I also really liked the fact that I never had to wait at an appointment\u2026 that is very unusual these days.\nDaryl is God sent to me. He has save me from frozen shoulder and helping me so that I do not need to have another shoulder surgery. I thank God for him every day. Thank you Daryl.\nPT Professionals has always been patient and attentive to my physical needs.\nDaryl is always willing to listen to an explanation concerning a physical problem in addition to offering both suggestions and support concerning the correction of the problem. To his credit, he is willing to listen to the patient\u2019s ideas concerning the correction of the problem. One of the reasons I am using PT Professionals\u2019 services is due to the fact that Daryl was my physical therapist with another organization. When he left the organization that he was previously employed with, I sought his help when I incurred another injury.\nI enjoyed visiting your professional and informative website. Brevard County is fortunate to have such qualified Physical Therapists and first class facility in the area.\nVery Positive! Our therapist was both professional and thorough and helped me figure out how to manage my pain. I am still improving as I use some of the techniques he taught me.\nWe enjoyed viewing your webpage. It is very informative and professional. What a time saver that people can print off their paperwork and have it filled out before their first appointment. Keep up the good work!\nAs a new patient, I look forward to my first visit next week. The website is user-friendly and informative.The online forms saves time for me and the office! No patient anxiety here!\nExcellent to see a PT group that prides itself on such a high level of training! I am a PT, DPT, and I am working on my MTC. I will be sure to keep your group on my \u201creferral radar\u201d!\nPT Professionals was very compassionate and attentive to my pain. They do not double book their patients, and it is a very comfortable environment for physical therapy. I have come a long way in just a short period of time. Thank you!!!\n\u201cIt has been great working with Erin and Nancy. They have been encouraging and patient with me as I progressed through my therapy. All of the staff are professional and friendly \u2013 calling patients by name, building rapport with each one and helping all of us- to regain good health. I would recommend PT Professionals (and have) to anyone need physical therapy\u201d.\nDaryl and his staff are an amazing group. Very knowledgable and professional. I went to their office with constant back pain that was preventing me from doing things I enjoyed. Daryl worked with me and taught ways to strengthen my muscles. Now I am virtually pain free and back to doing the things I love. Thank you PT Professionals!"
