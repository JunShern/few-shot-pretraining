    "text": "We got a sneak peek of the new airport at Devanhalli last Sunday.\nDid you know that the opening date of the airport is 31st March midnight, 2008? That was what Ren\u00e9 of the Zurich Airport team tells us as we huddle together at the new terminal building asking questions about whether it\u2019s really going to be ready on time!\nAt first sight, it doesn\u2019t seem like it is going to be ready in a couple of months. But apparently, this is how an airport usually looks before it opens so we have to believe the expert here. The approach road to the airport is being done as of now and about half of it is cemented. The rest is still a kaccha trail.\nInside the airport area, we are a little surprised by the size of the terminal! Considering, we\u2019ll be travelling around 3-4 hours (in peak time) to reach the airport, it does seem smaller than expected. The terminal, says Ren\u00e9 was built according to the 2005 projections (the airport itself was mooted in 1998!). So in the meanwhile, as air traffic has grown exponentially, the volumes that were initially projected are obviously not to the mark. But expansion plans are also in order already.\nThe arrival/departure lounge is going to be common for domestic and international travellers. We went around the different levels of the terminal. We saw around 7-8 luggage conveyor belts \u2013 considering there\u2019s one currently in the airport \u2013 it\u2019s quite an improvement!\nAnyway, here are the pictures. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get to hear and see more of the airport in the next couple of months.\nHow we will travel to this new airport, is another discussion all together!\nIt does seem like one small and really ugly airport. Those of us who were waiting for an airport that we can be proud of are going to be very disappointed.\nOne should see the plan of the hong-kong airport.\nFirst impression: Disappointingly small and ugly!\nThis does not look the kind of airport we should be upgrading to. This looks like the kind of airport we should be upgrading from. It looks like what the Bangalore airport should have been in decades past. It does not look like what it should be in the future! Again, W-T-F!\nWhy all the negativity.. I\u2019m usually the first to get frustrated with Bangalore, but this is definitely a step up.\nIt probably even has baggage belts that work.\nAnd maybe an ATM and an information desk.\nWhat more could you want? Clean bathrooms? Wifi? How about more than one one-person-wide door to get in? Nah\u2026. That\u2019s what the airport in 2050 is for.\nWhat we\u2019ve seen in the pics is the building shell with the embellishments sure to follow. What the heck, perhaps it *is* a comparitively dowdy looking airport. So what? Having a fully functional airport would be better than to have a hi-tech, futuristic one with nothing working. This is India so lets be a little down to earth, folks\u2026no pun intended, of course!\nLet\u2019s wait to see the outcome isnt it?\nIndia can do better than this. Way better. What you should be asking yourselves is has half the budget gone in bribes? and this is the result?\nI have visited Bangalore for the last 10 years, we have a family home 15 mins from this new airport and I\u2019m upset that this is the result from what was to be a very exciting project.\n\u201cRen\u00e9 of the Zurich Airport team tells us\u2026\u201d This means you went inside the airport and talked to a person called Renee for information.\nThen, what is the point in writing \u201csneak peek\u201d.\n1 sneak into/out/around, etc to go somewhere quietly because you do not want anyone to hear you. I sneaked into his bedroom while he was asleep.\nWe tried to sneak the dog into the hotel.\n3 sneak a look/glance at sb/sth to look at someone or something quickly and secretly. I sneaked a look at the answers.\n\u201csneak preview noun [C] an opportunity to see (a part of) something new before the rest of the public see it.\nWhy are you murdering English?\nToo much! Come on Mr Kumar! Have you seen the TV channels using the term Breaking News for the most insignificant items? I am sure the author(s) of this article wanted to add a little mischief into the title rather than give a straightforward boring one. Or maybe you are just used to plain boring newspapers like the Hindu who tread the safe line with English.\nComing to the Airport, at first glance, it does look rather disappointing but I would rather wait till the complete thing is over before screaming out.\nWe do need futuristic airports considering the way our numbers and the rate at which our economy is growing. We also need better transport to get us to this airport. Nowhere in the world have I heard people traveling three hours from the capital to get to their nearest airport.\nNo one should normally comment on the product when it is still going on!! The seed for this was sown about two decades ago, and now when we look at it and find it is only 77 days more to go we should wait and see why it took this long, and is the final product worth the wait!!\nEnglish is not our first language. So when we use it, we should be careful.\nMy comment was about the mismatch between the headline and the post.\nIn case you want more, we have been discussing BIAL almost no end: here.\nSeriously, how far apart are the Bangalore and Hyd airports?\nYou have to have a really serious reason to fly to Chennai, or even Hubli etc \u2013 the road trip\u2019s pretty quick and nice, and no aiport tax + fuel surcharge + blah to pay. The tolls are much cheaper.\nNo Kidding! I am supposed to travel to this airport in June and then travel on to Mysore. Sheesh. It will take more than the 3 hours it is taking right now!\nHey, am worried. This is just the international airport right? Not the domestic airport? Anita your comment about arrival and depature longue being common for domestic/international travellers has had me worried. I thought HAL would continue as the domestic terminal. Please clarify soon.\n2.How many immigration and custom counters?\n3.How the green channel will function if both domestic and international travellers will be bunched together.\n4.Rene seems to make a typical Indian bureacratic track that it is conceived in 1990,planned for 2005 and opening in 2008!!!He can fall back on this excuse to his finaciars.\n5.These fellows wanted the present one to close down. Has the Jeppsen and ADIZ and other navigational problems sorted out with director genral of civil aviation.Has new Alpha and Delta routes made and approval of ICAO obtained?\n6.Has the CISF which provides security has the necessary manpower recruited and trained for this airport?\n7.What are the types of the ILS,VOR,NDB installed and their category?\n8.what about airport,route survelliance radar?\nI hope anitha will take me with her for the next survey or someone who has flown or used airports as a pilot or navigator.\nHAL airport would be closed down when this airport is open..And I am really waiting for that to see if it reduces any traffic on current airport road and help my daily commute..\nThis is one of the worst airport. How 8 aero bridges sufficient for both domestic & international operation. It has only 6 conveyer belts? (How many for domestic/intl).\neven your semi-constructed house will look as UGLY. It would be wise to wait for the completion & open up with your comments.\n@ jagannath: i wouldn\u2019t say ugly. it\u2019s still under construction!\n@ Job: not sure about these exact logistics but i guess it will be revealed closer to the opening date.\n@ LL: Despair not, it\u2019s not as bad as it looks. It\u2019s still under the construction stage!\n@ santa: I don\u2019t think the design is the problem. The size might be considering we have more than 11 million passengers to handle.\n@ anjana: that\u2019s the spirit!\n@ andrew: i think you should take another look when it\u2019s closer to completion. it\u2019s really hard to tell as of now!\n@ Walter Solbchak: connectivity woes is going to be a pain point!\nand yes, it\u2019s going to be a nightmare to travel for more than 3 hours to catch a flight to say a place like chennai! futuristic airports are definitey what we need but we need leaders who have futuristic visions for that.\n@ sethuraman: yes, i think the judgement should wait till it\u2019s opened!\n@ lubna: this is both the domestic and international airport. the arrival departure lounge will be the same, we were told!\n@ venkat: let\u2019s wait to crib about facilities till it opens!\n@ captainjohann: i actually went for a run and did my best after it was over and we went for a small tour. i did not go as a journalist and all these questions would have taken a few hours for him to answer! and i\u2019m not an airport specialist either. so i suggest someone better equipped can go ask those questions!\n@ rdmblr: that\u2019s what we were told.\n@ nag: hey, maybe not! let\u2019s wait for it to open. it has more than 6, that\u2019s what i saw where i went.\n@ atthu: that would be a good idea!"
