The solution architecture is simple to install with a 2 MCU SBU and \u201cflat pack\u201d HLD and High Gain Antenna with a combined weight under 15.7Kgs (35 lbs). The system\u2019s High Gain Phased Array Antenna (HGA) is one of the lightest in its class.\nAVIATOR 350D offers significant size, cost and weight savings over legacy satcom solutions and is an ideal replacement for large Aero H/H+ terminals. The system\u2019s built-in wired and wireless Ethernet connectivity for the cockpit IP network allows for easy interfacing with external devices, such as EFBs, iPads or AIDs during all phases of flight. AVIATOR 350D is participating in the FAA PARC CWG SwiftBroadband Safety Service Evaluation program and offers a bridge to the next generation of multichannel SwiftBroadband terminals, which will have full aircraft domain segregation using Inmarsat\u2019s SwiftBroadband Safety Services."
