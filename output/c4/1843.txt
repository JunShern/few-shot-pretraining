I think Peter was going again today, do not know where he gets his energy, but many thanks to all.\nMy first trip with you.\n\u0093Myself and a friend booked to go on the day trip to Guernsey which was last month. From the moment the phone was answered and I heard the warmth and happiness in Tony\u2019s voice I knew it would be a lovely day out. The extremely comfortable coach was on time and arrival to Poole harbour was as predicted 9am.\n(Click here to open a scanned copy of the above letter).\n\u0093I would like to thank you on behalf of my auntie and myself for the really great coach trip to Highclere [Castle] and boat trip today. We had a lovely time. Your coach driver Robert and lovely lady assistant made it one of the best trips we have had.\nI will recommend your company to our friends.\nJust to say thank you very much for organising such a great day out [to Bletchley Park] yesterday.\nMy sister in law and myself had a lovely day.\nThe \u2018On Board\u2019 entertainment \u2018banter\u2019 between you both was also very amusing.\nWe are both hoping to go on one of the trips to Guernsey so I will phone asap on that one - and also one of the trips to Southend sounds good. Well they all sound good.\n\u2014 Wendy & Brian M.\n\u0093Another lovely day out to see the Three Queens in Southampton with Peter and Adam - weather slightly damp and the mist came down as the three liners sailed by Calshot but it was rather atmospheric as they appeared through the mist. Great harbour cruise followed by lovely meal at The Swan and drive through the New Forest.\n\u0093We have just returned from a very good day out to Guernsey with your company and have to say, what a super day it was.\nWe were collected from our collection point actually a few minutes early which was good, transported to the port, given all directions in easy stages by a very efficient tour host Eryl, and accompanied all the way with tips for how to spend our day in the venue.\nThe meals we were able to choose were very tasty, particularly for mass produced food, and, in short, all went completely to plan and a most enjoyable day. Our driver Adam was very careful and helpful and both of them combined made sure we all had a good day and explained all the necessary points we needed to enable us to enjoy our day and be in the correct place at the correct time.\n\u0093We went on the \u2018Longleat Trip\u2019 yesterday and have to write and say it was the most fantastic day. The Festival of Light was quite out of this world and we have, in the past, seen displays in Florida but this was something else again.\nOf course it was even better the way the coach trip went, Peter and Adam were just great. So friendly and helpful and so very informative that we knew exactly what and when event, pick-ups etc were going on. It was a great success and this could not have been better executed.\nPeter is superb at his role and made us all feel special and individual. It was nice not to have to drive for a change and sit and relax on the well driven coach. The price was also really good for all we saw and had, it really was an excellent day.\nDo hope you are able to do more trips from Basingstoke.\nI am a person who would say if things are not right so it\u2019s great to say you could have nothing to think about saying which was not \u2018first class\u2019.\n\u0093I would like to thank your team (Eryl and Adam the driver) on our trip to the Shard, Thames Clipper and Cable Car yesterday, they were both extremely helpful and informative. The trip was very well organised and even with a few traffic problems along the way Adam managed to get us to our destinations without too much delay. We had a wonderful day so would you kindly thank them both on behalf of myself, my wife and our friends, they are a credit to your company.\nWe have already booked another day out to Highclere Castle with your company which we are all looking forward to."
