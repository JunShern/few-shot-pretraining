    "text": "Censorship of the press is considered a heinous crime best avoided even by those political parties who would cheerfully see the UK emulate North Korea in all manner of things.\nCan you imagine the outcry if Oxfordshire County Council formally announced that no longer could you read the Guardian in their public libraries because they disliked an article published therein? Twitter would be ablaze, journalists outraged, and questions asked in parliament!\nYet just this week alone, a similar fate has befallen two bloggers, and the silence is deafening \u2013 even from within the blogosphere.\nThe blogsite \u2018Nutsville\u2019 has upset the Westminster Council head of legal, Peter Large. Quite apart from the usual threats of action for defamation, including demands to the web host asking them to censor the posts \u2013 they have also blocked the web site from being read in council premises, which include public libraries. The FOI request that has been sent to the council asking for the reasons behind this move \u2013 and pointing out that it may be in partial violation of The Human Rights Act 1998, Article 10, Freedom of Expression \u2013 must be answered by 23rd February, and may also produce a list of other political sites blocked by the council, which should be of interest.\nYou may want to read the full story on Nutsville\u2019s own site.\nUp in Rutland, a similar fate has befallen Martin Brookes, who specialises in stories regarding his local Rutland Council. He too, upset the council. His site is also blocked in public libraries.\nIf a site should host material which is defamatory, then taking legal action is perfectly acceptable \u2013 it is a risk that all bloggers must run, and we should comply with the law.\nHowever, local councils taking pre-emptive moves to block a web site from being read by those using their public libraries, before any such defamation has been shown to occur is another matter all together.\nWhy is this considered acceptable against bloggers, but would create outrage if practised against the main stream media?\nIs anyone aware of other instances of bloggers being censored in this way?\nDo any of you have the time to drop a FOI into your local council\u2019s IT department to see how wide spread this practice is, and which blogs are involved, so that we can get a picture of what is happening country wide?\nWe need to nip this one in the bud \u2013 public libraries may be run by local councils, that doesn\u2019t give them the right to decide what we read.\non. It is up to them to decide who is right in this fight.\n\u2018something sinister going on\u2019 principle?\nspecified website, is up to the owner, or those they place to act for them.\nPosting on any other person\u2019s website implies acceptance of this, I suppose.\nothers are, and I have to disagree with you, with all due respect.\nwith the obvious poster, not you folks.\nuse public libraries is my experience.\nmust therefore provide a web connection so that I can read it.\nbe filtered leading to \u201cclbuttic\u201d issues.\nproportion of the population. In other words ineffective.\nwithout fear of censorship. Off to dust off my vuvuzela.\nneed to call in Amnesty International just yet.\nor Mao and read it without the library saying that it\u2019s not allowed.\nbelieve libraries are, at least, at risk.\nitself open to a claim in defamation if it failed to block the site?\nmoderated out as breaking house rules.\nreport a fact of tyranny.\nthe ill-tempered and profane comments on Guido Fawkes\u2019 site certainly are.\nposts in the light of this!\nDitto, though my MP is worse than useless.\nthey do it, we call it tyrrany."
