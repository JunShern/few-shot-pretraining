    "text": "Video game statue maker First 4 Figures, who have already produced several SEGA and Sonic the Hedgehog premium collectable statues, have announced a new SEGA character and franchise that they will be adding to their ever expanding SEGA All-Stars collection; Yakuza\u2018s Kazuma Kiryu.\nTeased on their Facebook page, First 4 Figures announced that pre-orders start March 8th, 2016 and featured a peek at Kazuma\u2019s face. Thus far, fan reaction has been mixed. It is cool to see Yakuza joining the ranks of Shenmue and Skies of Arcadia, but they really didn\u2019t nail Kazuma\u2019s likeness. As is, he sort of looks like a cosplayer attempting a Kazuma Kiryu look. In the past, First 4 Figures have taken fan feedback very seriously and have altered character\u2019s faces to better match the source.\nWe\u2019ll share more details once pre-orders go live on March 8th!\nFor the past few months First 4 Figures, creators of high quality and high priced Sonic and SEGA statues, have been teasing a Sonic the Hedgehog statue to celebrate next year\u2019s 25th anniversary. Today, on the First 4 Figures Facebook page, the company has shared a concept sketch of the statue and are asking for fan feedback. Those who have followed First 4 Figures in the past know full well that they take feedback very seriously, often making major changes to statues to satisfy fans. The proposed Sonic 25th anniversary statue features Sonic playing a Dreamcast Sonic game on an item monitor. The base appears to be set in Green Hill Zone, much like the first Sonic statue and the 20th anniversary statue were. The reason Sonic isn\u2019t playing a Genesis/Mega Drive? First 4 Figures explained \u201cWe thought that as an anniversary piece, we wanted to try and touch on multiple eras in a single piece rather than making it strictly classic. The thought is well received though!\u201d. As for the Green Hill Zone base, First 4 Figures sound open to changing it, as they are aware that that location has been done far too many times already.\nAfter the break, hear my thoughts on the piece and check out the full piece of concept art.\nFirst 4 Figures is asking on Facebook for ideas for the upcoming Sonic the Hedgehog 25th anniversary statue. If you ever had a big idea for high quality Sonic the Hedgehog figurine, then you should probably post it up on their Facebook.\n-Classic Sonic is to be the main focus, but don\u2019t let that stop you from including other things from his history such as classic items.\nFirst 4 Figures previously did a 20th anniversary figure that sadly was only available to SEGA employees, this time around everyone will be able to buy the 25th anniversary figure. HA! Take that, SEGA employees!\nFirst 4 Figures have expanded their SEGA All-Stars range of statues with Sonic Team\u2019s NiGHTS, sporting the more recent NiGHTS: Journey of Dreams design. The statue is 12.5\u2033 high and comes in two flavors, the standard edition priced at $209.99 and limited to 1,000 pieces, and the exclusive edition with ambient lighting priced at $234.99 and limited to 500 pieces. Both are due for a Q3 2015 release date and can pre-ordered today!\nWhat do you think of the latest SEGA All-Stars statue? Maybe it\u2019s just me, but I prefer the original Saturn NiGHTS design.\nFirst 4 Figures has teased this image on their Facebook, giving their fans a small taste of whats to come. If you haven\u2019t heard of First 4 Figures, they make high quality video game figures in limited quantities. They dabble in Nintendo, Capcom and of course SEGA figures. I think my personally favorites are their Skies of Arcadia Vyse figure, Beat from Jet Set Radio, Akria from Virtua Fighter 5, and of course Ryo from Shenmue.\nNot only are First 4 Figures known for their quality, but they are also known for their high price tags. Don\u2019t be surprised if this figure goes on sale for over $200 dollars.\nLast week, First 4 Figures teased a very cool Sonic & Tails Tornado statue which was the second in their Sonic Diorama line. Today, pre-orders have officially opened, and we now have a whole slew of photos, the dimensions, the expected release date, and most importantly \u2013 the price! Selling for $299.99 the diorama measures 17.5\u201d tall x 14\u201d long x 14\u201d wide, is limited to 1000 pieces, and is expected to release Q4 2015 (the pre-order page accidentally lists \u201cQ4 2014\u201d). There is also an exclusive version, priced at $329.99, limited to 425 pieces, and featuring the inclusion of LEDs to give the rocket booster a flashing effect.\nAs you can see in the photos, found on the First 4 Figures pre-order page, the statue is a real beauty and is sure to be a hit with classic Sonic fans. But is it worth the asking price? Are you planning to pre-order the latest diorama? Sound off in the comments section!\nFirst 4 Figures SEGA All-Stars statue line expands to include Jet Set Radio\u2019s Beat \u2013 pre-orders now open!\nTeased late last week, First 4 Figures have now put their Jet Set Radio Beat statue up for pre-order. Like their Akria Yuki statue, it appears that Beat does not have an Exclusive Edition variant. The statue measures 14 inches tall, and retails for $229.99, limited to 1,250 pieces and due to release Q2 2015. One cool feature is the addition of LEDs which give the illusion of sparks shooting out from his skates as he grinds a rail.\nAfter the break, read the full product description!\nFirst 4 Figures are expanding their SEGA All-Stars line with a Jet Set Radio statue featuring GG\u2019s leader Beat! The rudie with that uki uki waku waku attitude joins the existing SEGA All-Stars line of statues which includes Shenmue\u2019s Ryo Hazuki, Virtua Fighter\u2019s Akira Yuki, and Skies of Arcadia\u2019s Vyse. While Beat\u2019s price is currently unknown, based on past statues in the line it could range from $170 to $200 or more depending on if there is an exclusive version as well. Pre-orders open November 18th, and we\u2019ll likely have all our details then.\nWhat do you think of First 4 Figures choice? What other SEGA franchises would you like to see in the All-Stars line?\nFirst 4 Figures Dr. Robotnik up for pre-order \u2013 wait, so it\u2019s not Dr. Eggman anymore?\nFirst 4 Figures is back again with a new classic era Sonic the Hedgehog statue up for pre-order, this time the star is Sonic\u2019s nemesis Dr. Robotnik. Yup, you heard that right, apparently SEGA gave the okay for F4F to use the old name that they\u2019ve pushed aside for the past 13 years. The statue is selling for $399.99 and is expected to release Q2 2015. If the price gave you a small heart attack, F4F has a flexipay option in which fans pay 3 monthly payments \u2013 two at $100 and a final payment of $199. The statue is also enormous, measuring 22\u2033 tall, and 19\u2033 wide. F4F also notes \u201cDr. Robotnik\u2019s package also includes an additional set of hands. As well as the open palms to replicate his signature classic pose, the package includes an additional 2 hands, each holding a Chaos Emerald, in call back to the classic \u2018Try Again\u2019 screen at the end of Sonic the Hedgehog 1. These can be swapped out or mixed with the other hands depending on the collector\u2019s preference.\u201d You can pre-order at the official F4f site. Now the question is, what\u2019s next? Classic Amy Rose perhaps?\nRegarding the name, while I know many Western Sonic fans grew up with Dr. Robotnik, I do find the decision to be a bit odd. Mainly because I always saw the Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog and Saturday morning cartoon design to be Dr. Robotnik, while the in-game version had a weird disconnect from the Robotnik name. With Sonic Generations poking fun at the old Robotnik name (\u201cNobody calls me that anymore!\u201d) and the Jazwares action figures labeling the character as Dr. Eggman, it\u2019s inconsistent with the brand to go back to the Dr. Robotnik name. Ah well, it\u2019s a bigass statue and that\u2019s good enough for me!"
