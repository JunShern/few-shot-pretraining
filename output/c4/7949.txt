    "text": "Pension M\u00e1ria is located in Trencin, the local part of Kubra . The guesthouse was originally a house built in 1925 by Mr. Valjent Rehak (woodcut on a wooden castle inside the building). In 2004, we converted the house to a restaurant and a sedentary style guesthouse .\nWe also adapted the offer of traditional Slovak cuisine . Part of the restaurant is the original mast , we preserved period wars, and decorated with subjects from the life of people around the year 1900.\nOn order for corporate and private events we bake: ducks, geese, piglets, knees, lambs.\nWe offer five double rooms with the possibility of extra bed with private bathroom , equipped with TV-SAT, WiFi .
