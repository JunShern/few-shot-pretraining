It's too good not to repost.\nOver the weekend we saw news reports that President Trump may make some sort of announcement about Jerusalem today.\nAt the same time, we also saw a lot of severe weather.\nJAN 23: Life-threatening and damaging waves of more than 10 meters high batter the Oregon coast this weekend!\nAfter 8 long years, one thing we know for sure about President Obama is that he is a mocker.\nAnd, on occasion, given to lying.\n'If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor'?\nWhen he signed his 'legacy' bill Obamacare, he mocked asteroids and earthquakes.\nSince time is short, I refer you to Michael Snyder's article noted above. Snyder lists a quick summary of scandals that did occur under Barack Obama.\nAUG 2012: Chemical weapons in Syria would be crossing a red line for Obama.\n2013: Claims he didn't set a red line for Syria and chemical weapons.\nWrong!

Crucify him!\nOnce Trump takes office, we are not out of the woods yet.\nAs winter storm Jupiter slams the central U.S. with ice and snow, winter storm Egon has hit Europe.\nLook at the countries impacted in the initial paragraph of this report, they are P5+1 countries, and the storm is happening the day before the 'peace' conference in Paris (emphasis mine).\nA powerful cyclone hit Great Britain on Thursday, January 12, 2017 and rapidly strengthened over the English Channel and northern France, bringing hurricane-force winds to the region. Its center then moved over Belgium, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Germany and Poland. This powerful winter storm, named Egon, is expected to continue its NNE track over Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, southeastern Finland and into northwestern Russia by early January 15, 2017 (UTC). At least 3 people have lost their lives by Friday evening.\nSo far so good this morning.\nAs we keep one eye on the P5+1's Iran nuclear deal and one eye on the upcoming 'peace' conference in Paris, would you like to know some of the disasters (and potential disasters) that have struck those countries involved in these two endeavors?\nWith that in mind, if nothing is posted here at the blog by 10 a.m. tomorrow or Monday (or possibly Tuesday), you can assume I am having power issues or Internet issues and will be back as soon as possible.\nIn the past, when the U.S. has come up against Israel, we have had significant weather events. Since the 'peace' conference is scheduled for Sunday, this certainly appears to be one of those times.\nWe are not the only ones facing brutal winter conditions. So is Europe.\nWhile I've been busy watching the upcoming January 15th peace conference, a friend in Mexico (Thank you, Robert!) has let me know that there have been some serious financial turmoil going on there.\nJAN 12: Michael Snyder: Why Has The White House Suddenly Released A Strategy For Dealing With The Threat Of A Catastrophic Meteor Impact?\nSide note: I've long believed David Wilkerson's Urgent Message of March 2009 might involve an approaching asteroid or comet, mainly because his message seems to indicate people all over the world will panic, grocery stores will be emptied in an hour, and he felt led to use the verse from Psalm 11 about 'snares,' which are 'burning coals.' It doesn't help any that the whole world is coming up against Israel on the 15th. I AM NOT SAYING ANYTHING WILL HAPPEN; SNARKY EMAILS WILL NOT BE ANSWERED. Just sharing a personal belief.\nThe UN resolution specifically condemns Israel for building 'settlements,' including those for natural growth, which means the Israelis cannot expand housing of any kind, even if babies are born and families need more room.\nBy the way, that's a requirement NOT put on any other nation in the world.\nLet's be even more specific. The nations of the world don't want the Jews spreading out to any other areas, not even in their own land.\nRemember this from Daniel Greenfield?\nLet's take a look at the 'settlements,' or housing situation here in the US.\nUS Housing Market In Peril As \"Increase In Mortgage Rates Has Shocked Consumers\"\nNYC Homelessness Surges To The \"Highest Levels Since The Great Depression\"\nChinese Developers Rethink U.S. Real Estate Projects: \"I See Danger...U.S. Real Estate Is Peaking\"\nSome of the other nations that have come up against Israel haven't done so well with their housing situation either.\nChina Real Estate Price BOOM as Economy Sinks Faster Than Titanic!\nAre They Planning To Use \u2018Russian Interference\u2019 As An Excuse To Invalidate Trump\u2019s Election Victory?\nAre We Being Set Up For A Crash?\nDid Chuck Schumer just threaten Donald Trump?\nDoes Obama Feel 'Any Responsibility' for US-Russia Relations, Racial Tension, Election Rejection?\nHas Obama\u2019s Israel gambit already backfired by dividing the left and uniting the right?\nIs 100% Of \"US Warming\" Due To NOAA Data Tampering?\nIs Donald Trump Going To Nominate Ted Cruz To Fill The Open Seat On The Supreme Court?\nIs Janet Yellen Concerned About \"A Bubble In Stock Prices\"?\nMaybe it's not wise to celebrate mental illness?\nWere Democrats Beaten By Their Own \"War Of Narratives\"?\nWhat if Obama dropped Hillary's email bombs?\nWhere are all the world's billionaires?\nWho do you believe America?

Not totally unusual but interesting timing.\nTonight's the night, and it's gonna be a big one! As Sabbath begins, Obama and friends will be in party mode.\nDoesn't it remind you of this?\nIt was Belshazzar's last night as a happy man. Judgment was about to fall, at the hands of those ancient Persians, and he hadn't a clue.\nBelshazzar ordered the golden and silver vessels from the Temple in Jerusalem to be brought to his feast so he and his guests could toast the gods of Babylon.\nAt least President Obama won't be doing that, but given the recent UN move against Jerusalem and his potent levels of narcissism, he'll probably self-toast his outwit, outlast, outplay skills against that chickens**t Benjamin Netanyahu as pretty good.\nAs Yisrael Medad notes in this next article, forget dividing Jerusalem. If those who heard John Kerry speak last Wednesday really parse his words, it appears Obama's real intent is to take ALL of that Holy City. Read it for yourself.\nThe incoming, primarily dominant Republican Congress, has repudiated John Kerry channeling President Obama's goal.\nAs we all know, the Persians have never gone away, they are still here as the Iranians. One can't help but wonder that since Belshazzar apparently partied without any fear of enemies attacking that perhaps he thought he was on pretty good footing with the Iranians Persians?\nJesus and Paul in the Dead Sea Scrolls!\n\"Everything's dead!\" Marine mystery in Canada's Novah Scotia intensifies!
