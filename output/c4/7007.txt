    "text": "Integrative Urgent Care is the Glendora community's premier choice for flu shots.\nIntegrative Urgent Care is the place to go for Influenza prevention, treatment, and education. With our extended available office hours and online check-in consider us your local headquarters for everything thing flu-related.\nAs indicated by the CDC, Infuenza cause an expected 9.2 million to 35.6 million illnesses every year. Of these, between 140,000 to 710,000 cases require hospitalization. From 12,000 to 56,000 cases are deadly.\nOur job is to ensure you don\u2019t end up as one of those unfortunate statistics let\u2019s begin by covering some critical influenza facts. By learning a few facts, our goal is to help you limit downtime, abstain from infecting others, and in a perfect world, prevent this type of cold virus completely.\nSeasonal influenza incorporates four unique types of Infuenza infection, three types of the viruses infect and harm humans.\nInfuenza A and B viruses are commonly responsible for the regular flare-ups in the U.S. The A virus is linked to the worldwide diseases of Bird Influenza and Swine Influenza. The C virus is typically milder and not likely to cause real harm. Infuenza D infects livestock, not people.\nSpreading this season\u2019s flu virus is simple and often done easily, since there\u2019s a delay in the onset of symptoms. You infect others before you know you have the Flu or show symptoms. Since you can be contagious as early as day one and up to a week after \u201cfeeling fine\u201d, the on off chances are high of contamination. The very young, the elderly and those with compromised immune systems are most at risk of remaining contagious for longer periods.\nThe CDC recommends those that are contaminated with the Flu remain home for no less than 24 hours after the fever has broken without the need for fever-decreasing medication.\nInfluenza treatment can be hard to get correct, since symptoms may resemble many other illnesses. A sore throat, fever, runny nose or stuffiness can be related to a wide range of sicknesses\u2014most often, an old fashioned cold.\nFlu Symptoms also differ from person to person. One can encounter weakness, body pain, and chills, while another encounters fever, diarrhea and vomiting. As anyone might expect, this season\u2019s cold virus can be about difficult to analyze without a Flu test, which must be administered not long after becoming infected.\nPatients generally want to know how to prevent the flu and flu symptoms. There are couple of compelling over the counter drugs. A few sources suggest zinc, echinacea, vitamins, or even certain foods to weaken influenza, incorporating nourishments rich in cancer prevention agents, lean protein, and vitamins A, C, and E.\nWhen already infected, getting rid of the flu is slow \u2013 it only takes time and the body\u2019s own fighting immune system to effect flu. Your Integrative Urgent Care provider may prescribe in certain circumstances, an antiviral medication which can weaken Infuenza symptoms as well as the decrease the duration of the illness.\nAlthough antiviral drugs are generally helpful in treating flu symptoms, the most effective time to administer is within the first 48 hours of flu symptom onset. For patients at high-risk, or for those exposed to the virus who haven\u2019t yet exhibited symptoms generally anti-viral drugs are reserved as a preventive measure.\nHow Clever Is The Flu?\nThe flu virus cleverly fools the body\u2019s immune system which makes flu remedies often ineffective. So the virus changes slightly so it becomes unrecognizable to the immune system, as soon as you develop proper protection.\nBecause of this cycle you may get the flu virus year after year after year. The flu vaccine must be regularly updated to remain useful due to the constant mutation.\nThe most effective ways to prevent the flu, start with flu season tips to avoid the flu.\nInfuenza are highly contagious viruses that can affect people of all ages fast. Your Integrative Urgent Care provider has expertise on how you can prevent a flu epidemic. The most convenient, affordable, and effective way to prevent a flu virus from infecting you, your family, and others is the Flu vaccine.\nTwice a year, medical specialists identify which flu viruses will most likely occur through research. Vaccines are then made containing inert or \u201cdead\u201d samples of those viruses. The inert virus samples are then injected in order to train the body. The body\u2019s immune system responds by developing antibodies that protect against those identified viruses.\nGet a flu shot annually to help prevent the flu. Best tip is to get a flu shot annually. While only 60% effective in complete prevention, the flu shot prevents more severe symptoms. Those vaccinated suffer less from the virus and tend to get a milder form of the flu than those who are not vaccinated.\nThe proper flu shot depends on age, medical history, and many other individual factors. Your Integrative Urgent Care provider helps you determine the right vaccine for you or your family member. Keep in mind, there is more than one kind of Influenza shot.\nFlu vaccines contain only inactivated or weakened flu viruses, incapable of infection. So you cannot get the Flu from a flu shot however, some people experience soreness, tenderness, and redness in the area around the shot. Also common soon after the vaccination can be low-grade fever, headaches, and muscle aches.\nStaying one step ahead of the flu is the best prevention. We recommend everyone six months and older have a flu shot. Ideal get vaccinated in late summer or early fall, before flu season begins. Because the flu vaccine may take up to two weeks to provide full protection, get vaccinated by October. However, any time of the year is still better to get a a flu vaccine than not at all.\nThe flu shot is the most inexpensive flu prevention method. In fact, the trivalent vaccine, commonly used and approved for those between 18 and 64 years, is available at Integrative Urgent Care for just $20 per shot, without insurance.\nCheck with Integrative Urgent Care to see whether the trivalent vaccine is the right choice for you this season. And remember, the sooner you get it, the sooner the antibodies can take effect, the less vulnerable you are to the flu.\nProtect yourself by visiting Integrative Urgent Care before and during flu season. For convenience, you can walk-in, or check in online first for faster treatment.\nThere are some who should get the shot only on recommendation from their doctor or even not at all. If you have any one of the following: a fever above 100 degrees, an allergy to ingredients in vaccines, or an allergy to eggs, you should let your healthcare provider know. At Integrative Urgent Care, we can help you determine a better alternative.\nThe influenza virus mutates quickly, even though the antibodies created by the flu shot stay in your body for years. That\u2019s why the flu shot is recommended annually. Your body learns to fight off the virus with the flu shot.\nSince there is not a flu cure, yet, the flu shot provides the best protection for you and your family against the illness. You\u2019ll feel relieved that you have received the added protection of the flu shot. You greatly reduce your chances of requiring flu treatment and being confined at home missing time at work or at school.\nWe all agree, protection against the flu is really important. To help our community, Integrative Urgent Care offers walk-in flu shots seven days a week. We make it affordable and convenient to get the flu vaccines needed, with a range of flu shots for those over 5 years of age."
