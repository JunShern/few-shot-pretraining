The thing is, other people who have ordered products get a very detailed description of their order. For example they get country by country itinerary whereas mine is so simple on the apple order status site. Why is this? An I missing something?\nIt is just shipping from a new location. Just what are you really wanting to know.\nIf your worried about you not receiving that mbp, it's apples problem if it gets lost not yours. You don't own that laptop until it is in your possession.\non the order status now, it's telling me i'll have it tomorrow and it's being held locally ready for delivery.\nBut what i really wanted to know was the course it's taken. i'm just interested to see which country it's flown to, one after the other. I have seen some peoples order status screen shots reveal that exact info."
