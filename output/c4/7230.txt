(That\u2019s 2 tons for you pickup truck drivin\u2019 folks!)So why would ANYONE think that a piece of plastic sheeting over a hole dug in the ground would be enough to safely contain that fuel?? You got me. Maybe too many years on the site without a hard hat?Well, whatever it is, it must happen a lot because images like the one above are commonplace on construction sites. Take a peek the next time you drive by one (just a quick peek though!) and there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll see it.\nThe RIGHT WAY to handle the potentially disastrous spill from a fuel tank is with one of our Ultra-Containment Sumps, UltraTech\u2019s economical yet effective spill containment products designed specifically for these fuel tanks.\nOther sizes are also available, please call us at 800-213-7092 for more information.\nThis entry was posted in General and tagged Containment, Fuel Tanks, Sump.
