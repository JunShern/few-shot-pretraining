    "text": "An outright gift of cash is the simplest way to support Eller activities. Checks should be made out to UAF \u2013 Eller College, with the specific purpose on the memo line or on the check stub.\nMany companies match the charitable contributions of employees. If you work for a matching gift company, your gift to the Eller College could be worth two, three, or even four times as much. In most cases, using this benefit is as easy as contacting your human resources office. Typically, all that is required is a short gift validation form mailed in with your paid contribution. Thousands of potential donation dollars are missed out on each year when match-eligible donors fail to submit company matching forms \u2014 so if you are considering making a gift, check with your human resources office about matching opportunities.\nGifts of appreciated securities can provide special tax advantages, including a charitable deduction for the full fair market value of the gift and avoidance of capital gains taxes. Accepted appreciated securities include stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. The simplest and most efficient way to make a gift of any security is to instruct your broker to transfer the security to the University of Arizona Foundation for the benefit of the Eller College of Management. To arrange for your gift, you or your broker may contact us at 520.621.2125.\nCreate your legacy through a planned gift. Charitable gifts help you meet your current philanthropic goals and extend your generosity well into the future. A planned gift can also protect your assets, provide for your family, and provide you income for life. You can even make a significant impact through a gift that costs you nothing in your lifetime (through a charitable bequest under your will.) For more information about the many ways in which you can make a planned gift to benefit the Eller College, please visit uafoundation.giftplans.org or contact us at 520.621.2125.\nGifts of real estate are sold quickly and converted into cash or used directly in connection with a University program. All real estate gifted to the University of Arizona Foundation is on the market for sale. Types of accepted real estate include vacant land, residential property, and commercial property. Improved property with mortgages can be accepted if the loan is 50% or less of the appraised value and can be sold quickly. For more information about real estate gifts to support the Eller College, please contact us at 520.621.2125.\nAnother way to support the UA is through gifts of tangible personal property. When the gift relates to the \u201ccharitable purpose\u201d of the UA, you may be eligible for a deduction equal to the full fair market value of the item. Gifts in-kind include computer equipment, automobiles, furnishings, precious minerals, livestock, and machinery. For more information about ways to make an in-kind gift to benefit the Eller College, please contact us at 520.621.2125."
