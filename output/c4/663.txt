    "text": "The task context considers the relationships between business framework and project, which can be synergetic or competing.\nThe social context is the result of a project environment analysis internal and external.\nThe business case includes pre- and post-project phase. All processes are subject to an economic analysis recording and evaluating the direct project costs and the consequential costs and benefits.\nThe relationship between the environments and the project has to be evaluated and shown in a graphic. The evaluation results in appropriate measures for relationship management.\nProject definition defines what is in the project, what are the limits of the project, what is the scope of the project. The definition concerns 3 dimensions: tasks, time and social aspects.\nThis analysis is carried out for the same three dimensions: tasks, time and social aspects.\nIt is critical to find out who supports the project, and who could be a hindrance.\nWhat are the project theme and content? What environmental issues could affect the project?\nDoes the project match with the mission statement of our school?\nWhat has lead to the project?\nWhich decisions have already been made? Which documents do exist?\nWhat will be different after the project? What are the costs and benefits?\nWho takes which roles? Who is project manager, team member, project coach?\nFormulate the goals positively! Goal is profit!\nNon-Goals are important. What should not be reached? Non-Goals could be goals of other projects.\nNegative effects are not non-goals.\nAs detailed as necessary, as general as possible!\nGoals have to be measurable.\nDon\u2019t describe measures how the goals should be reached.\nDefinition of goals requires prioritizing.\nGoals affect amount of resources required.\nDefinition clarifies where to go and helps to cooperate.\nWhich problem should be solved?\nWhat happened during the pre-project phase?\nWho controlled the pre-project phase?\nWho promoted the idea, who affected the idea negatively?\nWhich decisions have been made?\nWhat will be after the project?\nWhich activities to be carried out after the project have to be thought of?\nProject manager coordinates all activities. She/he alone has the right for amendments.\n1.What does the project definition and the analysis of project context show?\n2.What are the dimensions of definition and context analysis?\n3.Which tools do you use for visualization of pre- and post-project phase?\n4.Which tools do you use for showing goals, non-goals and main tasks?\n5.What\u2019s included in the task context?\n6.Name and describe the different project roles, explain their main tasks.\n7.What is the content of the social context analysis?"
