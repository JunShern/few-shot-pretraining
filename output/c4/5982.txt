    "text": "His obstacles were many. Some might have said insurmountable. He was a painfully shy black man with a hearing problem, trying to break into major market radio and television in the \u201960s. Yet Garry Armstrong went on to accomplish amazing things in his illustrious broadcast career.\nWhereas racism was certainly a factor in Armstrong\u2019s career as a person of color, it was never really a defining issue to him. \u2018I was just so driven to succeed, racism was never a major thing on my radar,\u2019 he says. \u2018I was much more aware of my hearing difficulties. It was more personal.\u2019 Armstrong worked hard on his diction, taking speech therapy in college, to counteract his hearing deficiency.\nAfter college, at ABC radio network news, he transcribed radio interviews from news legends such as Ted Koppel and Bill Beutel and became the youngest producer at the network. He edited the copy of biggies such as Paul Harvey, Edward P. Morgan, and Howard Cosell.\nIn 1968, ABC sent Armstrong out to cover major events, such as the iconic Democratic National Convention in Chicago and the Tet Offensive in Vietnam. His most memorable \u2018war story\u2019 was when he sat around a campfire in Vietnam, chatting and eating beans with then-President Lyndon B. Johnson.\nShortly thereafter, he landed an on-air job at a small TV station in Hartford, CT. \u2018It was so small that there were only 2 on-air people,\u2019 explains Armstrong. He became the all-purpose news reporter and learned how to shoot and edit film. Once, however, Armstrong learned a humbling lesson when he returned from scoring a scoop to discover he\u2019d forgotten to load film into the camera.\nUltimately, Armstrong was hired as a general assignment reporter at Boston\u2019s Channel 7, where he flourished throughout his 31-year tenure. He established a rapport with both the black and white communities during Boston\u2019s divisive school desegregation period. Yet his reporting career was certainly not without incident.\nFor example, while covering a story in South Boston, he was accosted by an angry crowd. His first thought was to get the film back to the station, so he made sure it got into the news van.\nBut the crowd was chanting racial epithets at him, including the N-word. Armstrong defused the situation in Mel Brook-sian fashion. He turned to the crowd and said, \u2018I\u2019m not an \u2018N\u2019. I\u2019m a Samoan!\u2019 And the crowd backed off.\nAnother time, a radio station reported that Armstrong had been seriously injured in a race-related m\u00eal\u00e9e. When he called the newsroom to say he\u2019d be back soon with the film, the assignment editor was shocked. He thought Armstrong had been taken to the hospital, and stopped the station from going on the air with a bulletin reporting on his reporter\u2019s alleged beating.\nDespite all the celebrities, political leaders and newsmakers he covered, Garry, the seasoned reporter, turned into an awed beginner when he interviewed his movie idol John Wayne during the Duke\u2019s visit to Boston in the early \u201970s. Afterward, Garry repeatedly asked his Channel 7 colleagues if they knew who shook his hand until they suggested he calm down and get back to finishing his story.\nRoger Lyons is a veteran of the Boston television market. He has worked at many stations in news, public affairs, promotion, and advertising. Roger has numerous Emmy nominations, many other industry awards."
