There are several projects of possible interest to solo gamers.\nI recently reviewed Archmage, and it's a game that is good for solo and really good with a group. This expansion will offer new spell cards and new options for solo/cooperative play\u2014and at a great price ($30). The one thing that was \"missing\" from the base game was more spell variety, and the new gameplay options that this expansion is offering look truly exciting. Starling Games is also reprinting the Archmage base game, so this is a good time to pick it up if you're interested."
