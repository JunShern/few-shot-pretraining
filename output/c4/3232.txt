    "text": "I\u2019m not one to adhere rigidly to the idea of drinking seasonally: reds when it\u2019s cold, whites and ros\u00e9s when the weather heats up. This is textbook nonsense that makes it seem as if temperature is the only consideration in choosing a wine.\nBut this is winter, a time to hunker down. For many, that means seeking pleasure in long, slow cooking.\nIn Manhattan, where I live, the idea of a hearth may be fanciful, but the warmth of the oven or stove, with a bubbling pot of beans or a simmering stew, serves the crucial figurative function.\nThe sorts of deep, soulful flavors that come from blends of herbs and spices, long braises, and meats and birds roasted on the bone require specific sorts of wines. Most often they are reds, but not just any sort of red. These foods demand staying power and the ability to stand up to robust flavors.\nYet they must also fulfill the fundamental roles of providing refreshment and enhancing meals without overpowering them. This means wines that are balanced and energetic, substantial rather than ethereal, yet not blusterous or domineering.\nHere are 20 red wines that meet those requirements, not ranked in any particular order. All are in that $15-to-$20 sweet spot where price intersects with quality and distinctiveness to yield great value. You can certainly find plenty of sound wines for less than $15, but chances are they will not be as interesting.\nFor more than $20, you can start to add in wines that may fit the bill from more highly regarded regions, like the northern Rh\u00f4ne, Priorat, even Burgundy, though pretty soon you could be spending a lot of money.\nStaying in the $15-to-$20 range requires searching outside the status areas, and trying wines that often come from little-known regions, are made from grapes that are not celebrated, and are frequently in limited production. If the wines are more familiar, like California cabernet sauvignon or Oregon pinot noir, they will often be made from young vines, or come from surplus grapes that were sold off.\nWhat you won\u2019t find here are fabricated, artificial products made with technological shortcuts or grapes that come from inappropriate areas, which permit production of cheap bottles in great quantities.\nThis means that most people will be able to find only some of these wines. As always, ask for other recommendations at the best wine shop nearby.\nThe Shebang series, moderately priced wines from Morgan Twain-Peterson\u2019s excellent Bedrock Wine Company, offers modern versions of California field blends. This spicy, gutsy wine comes from multiple vineyards and appellations, includes many grapes (with probably a lot of zinfandel and carignan), and mixes several vintages. The result is a delicious, long-lasting red with flavors of licorice, herbs and red and black fruits.\nCamp\u2019s group of moderately priced Sonoma wines comes from Kenny Likitprakong\u2019s Hobo Wine Company, which makes very good wines from all over California under several labels. This young cabernet is bright and well balanced, with a touch of earth and tannins that simply let you know they are there. It\u2019s easy to enjoy right now, especially with juicy braised meats.\nGood, moderately priced pinot noir from California is tough to find, because most of it comes from areas not well suited to the grape. Searching for well-priced pinot noirs is far more rewarding in Oregon, where land and labor costs have not accelerated out of control. This one from Les Brebis, a small producer in the Willamette Valley, is direct and without the sort of artifice often found in inexpensive pinot noirs. Its earthy flavors of red and black fruits and herbs pair well with pork, chicken and salmon.\nWhy, here\u2019s another one, also from the Willamette, and quite different in style from the Brebis. It\u2019s made from organic and biodynamically grown grapes, and is equally elegant in profile. It\u2019s a little more floral and herbal, and it has a meatier character, with a deliciously savory edge. Try it with hearty soups.\nYet another side of cabernet franc, this one comes from W\u00f6lffer Estate on the South Fork of Long Island. It\u2019s rich and expressive, more in the Bordeaux style than the Loire, less subtle, more open and welcoming. It\u2019s balanced and earthy, and though the tannins are still a bit firm, it will go well with a meaty stew.\nSan Diego? Seriously? While the San Diego coast is more readily associated with beach volleyball and Navy bases, San Diego County is also home to a small wine region with some surprisingly good producers. Vesper Vineyards makes this fruity, smoky, well-balanced carignan tempered by citrus highlights.\nFoxglove is the reliable value arm of Varner Wine, which makes fine chardonnays and pinot noirs. Foxglove expands that range with moderately priced wines like this Paso Robles cabernet, which is bold and intense yet not at all a fruit bomb. It\u2019s juicy and balanced, and will go well with steaks and chops.\nAn earlier version of this article misstated the name of the importer of Fattoria La Rivolta Aglianico del Taburno. It is T. Edward Wines, not T. Edwards Wine."
