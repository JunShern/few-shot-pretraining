    "text": "FRISCO, Texas \u2013 Here\u2019s all you need to know about December football.\nIt\u2019s a division game, and it\u2019s the next game.\nbeating New Orleans wasn\u2019t viewed as much a statement as just another step.\nThere was an interesting vibe when the Cowboys\u2019 locker room opened to the media after that game. Kind of subdued, to be honest.\nThat\u2019s not the sound of a satisfied team. That\u2019s a group who felt the sting of 3-5, with everyone counting them out.\nFortunes turn very quickly in this league. Just look at the Washington Redskins\u2019 dive from first place to three straight losses while losing their top two quarterbacks.\nThe Eagles (6-6) come to AT&T Stadium next, down a game in the division standings despite winning back-to-back games for the first time this season. The Cowboys were in that position four weeks ago at the Linc, where their four-game win streak started. They\u2019ll take nothing for granted.\nno one benefited more from this mini-bye than Ezekiel Elliott.\nFew jobs in this league take a larger physical toll than a featured running back. This season, Elliott has averaged 24.4 touches per game \u2013 240 carries and 53 catches. In the last three games against Atlanta, Washington and New Orleans, he got roughly the same workload \u201324.7 touches per game (72 carries and 2 catches) \u2013 packed into an 11-day stretch.\nPlus, there\u2019s this: Elliott ran the ball at least 20 times (23, 26, 23) in three straight games for only the second time this season. Prior to the Thanksgiving stretch, he\u2019d only gotten 20-plus carries in three of the first nine games.\nElliott wants the ball. He knows that in many ways, he\u2019s the engine for this offense. But he also dealt with a little hip soreness last week before the Saints game, according to head coach Jason Garrett.\nThe Cowboys get back to practice Wednesday, six days after the Saints game. That can only help Zeke.\nwho would\u2019ve picked the Cowboys to beat New Orleans knowing the offense would convert only 1 of 4 chances inside the 20-yard line.\nActually, the total was 1 of 5, but I\u2019m not counting the victory formation in the final 1:58 after Jourdan Lewis\u2019 interception.\nAs well as the offense has played during this four-game stretch, the red zone looks like the biggest area for improvement. For the season, the Cowboys rank 26th in red zone efficiency, scoring touchdowns on 48.7 percent of their trips inside the opponents\u2019 20. (By comparison, Pittsburgh leads the league at 77.8 percent.) The percentage didn\u2019t improve dramatically during these four straight wins, either (7 of 13, or 53.8 percent).\nGoing deeper, the Cowboys rank 31st in goal-to-go situations, scoring touchdowns only 52.6 percent of the time. They\u2019re 4 of 9 in the last four games, including a missed opportunity inside the Saints\u2019 5.\nFans have griped about the play-call choices in some of these spots \u2013 specifically, passing instead of handing the ball to Elliott. Devil\u2019s advocate: Noah Brown and Cole Beasley were wide open in the end zone against Washington and Atlanta, respectively, but the passes fell incomplete.\nIt\u2019s less of an issue when the Dallas defense is playing at an elite level, and the Eagles have had their own problems in the red zone at times, too. They rank 19th (55.8 percent) and were 3 of 5 Monday against Washington, coming up empty twice due to an interception and turnover on downs.\nOne of many keys to watch in the next biggest game of the season this Sunday."
