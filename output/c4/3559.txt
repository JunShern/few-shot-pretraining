    "text": "How much do you rely on recipes?\nWe really like cookbooks. I like to read them for ideas. DH likes to actually use them (I use them too, but generally with more modifications). We both love to try new different things, which means that now we\u2019re back from Paradise with more limited food options if we want new and different without first driving for two hours, we\u2019re going to have to make it ourselves.\nCooking without a cookbook is how I was taught. Most of our groceries were based on whatever was on sale, which means my parents were very good at cooking based on what we had rather than going out to buy things based on what they planned to cook.\nWe\u2019ve sort of reversed that now that A. we have enough money that it doesn\u2019t matter if an ingredient is expensive when not on sale (though I still use walnuts in place of pinenuts in pesto\u2013 I still have limits) and B. DH has taken over the bulk of the cooking.\nWe haven\u2019t been for a full grocery run for a couple of weeks. We had a couple of dinner parties for which we over-bought and then got overwhelmed with the CSA and then ended up not making things on our menu plan because we got busy. I hate wasting food, so instead of our usual weekly menu planning I basically told DH just to get a few necessities and we would eat down our freezer and the fridge.\nOne of the things we needed to deal with was a head of broccoli. We\u2019d put a broccoli chicken casserole (from The Old Fashioned Cookbook) on the menu list, but it had been there for a couple of weeks and DH just wasn\u2019t into it. So I suggested maybe we could use up the pie crusts leftover from our last party (we\u2019d made mini-quiches) to make a chicken broccoli potpie instead. He was much more enthusiastic about the idea than he\u2019d been about casserole and suggested we make it that night.\nI found him in the kitchen with two pots and a pan on the stove, the grater and a measuring cup out along with the milk, and a big hunk of cheese. There was chicken sauteeing in the pan and chopped broccoli on a cutting board. After some questioning he pointed to a broccoli cheese pie recipe he\u2019d found on the internet. The big pot was slowly boiling water to blanch the broccoli. The little pot was for making cheese sauce. The grater was for the cheese. We discussed the cheese which had not been part of my mental picture and decided we\u2019d try it. At that point DC2 demanded Daddy\u2019s presence in another room and I took over.\nI put the pots and grater and measuring cup away. I finished cooking the chicken. I added the broccoli, stirred, and put a lid on. Every few minutes I opened up the lid to stir again. After the broccoli was just a little undercooked, I poured in a handful of flour and stirred it all around. Then I decided that wasn\u2019t enough flour because not every floret or chicken piece had been coated, so I added some more. And stirred and toasted a bit. Then I poured in some milk and stirred until it became a gravy. Not all of the flour had dissolved yet, so I added some more milk and stirred some more. Then I diced a few pieces of cheddar (first I tried slicing and breaking them into chunks, but the chunks were too big, so I diced the next few) and threw them in one slice at a time and stirred until they melted. When the gravy looked cheesy enough I stopped adding cheese. I turned off the stove, stirred a bit more, and stuck on a lid (note: we have an electric stove\u2013 if we\u2019d had gas, then I would have turned it down to a simmer).\nPot pie is one of my standard recipes that I make without a recipe. It always starts with a meat or mushrooms (if there\u2019s raw carrots or onions I throw them in before the meat, otherwise raw veggies go after\u2026 frozen or cooked veggies go in after the roux), then I put in flour (and maybe spices) with the meat and toast to make a roux. I then add water or milk or soup stock depending on the kind of roux I\u2019m making. Then cooked/frozen veggies. Then it\u2019s ready to be thrown into a prepared pie crust and baked. The only thing I need a recipe for is remembering how long to bake the thing.\nI\u2019ve got lots of other standard basic recipes. Quiche, stirfry, spaghetti, chili, \u201csoup\u201d (I really hate \u201csoup\u201d, since that\u2019s where my father always put all of the leftover odds and ends whether they went together or not\u2013 so these days we always make soups from a recipe), grilled cheese sandwiches with stuff, empanadas, tacos, baked chicken, fried porkchops, all sorts of fish things, fruit crumble, fruit pie, even granola (thanks miser mom!).\nI don\u2019t measure things, I just have a sense of about how much to add and I can tell when it\u2019s not enough. I don\u2019t know how long things take (except the oven part), but I have a sense of when they\u2019re about ready.\nLately we\u2019ve been mostly using recipes. I\u2019ll still substitute based on what we have or what we need to use up. But it\u2019s still kind of fun to just make something based on what we have available.\nBefore the internet made it easy to find exotic recipes, I used to play around to replicate what I\u2019d eaten at restaurants. Or to fit some craving I was having. We don\u2019t really do that anymore. Instead we\u2019ll find the highest rated recipe on the food network and use that instead. There\u2019s less randomness. On the whole, it\u2019s probably better, in the same way that the Garmin and Yelp have improved our eating out experiences, but we have lost a bit of the serendipity that comes from getting lost and finding something off the beaten path.\nAnother thing I noticed was that I cook in order to minimize the number of dishes used and the time spent in the kitchen. DH will sometimes do a mise en place. Generally I\u2019ll do my chopping in a way that minimizes the number of cutting boards used (keeping in mind that after a board has touched raw meat it must be washed before using again) and takes advantage of waiting time to chop the next ingredient. This is partly because I get bored waiting in the kitchen, but mostly because growing up I was the one who was going to have to wash all those dishes by hand. Most of my meals take one or at most two pots.\nHow do you do most of your cooking? Do you use recipes for most things? Do you use a recipe as a base idea and then modify it? Do you have a repertoire of memorized baseline meals that can be modified? Do you like trying out new recipes? Do you buy based on what you want to make or do you make based on what you have on hand? And\u2026 do you think your answers to the previous questions are related to when you learned to cook?\nRecipes, rarely. When I do, I tend to just see what the ingredients are. Shop for food based on what\u2019s fresh and on special.\nThat is a good way to save money and eat produce when it\u2019s at its peak.\nSame here. Fresh things rather than processed, and I read recipes to see what might be needed. I also have to make sure that a 3-year-old can & will eat at least one item at every meal.\nI read a lot of cookbooks for ideas but rarely cook exactly to a recipe. I pride myself on my ability to take a random assessment of ingredients that happen to need using up and turn them into something delicious. We actually get a meal ingredient delivery service with ingredients and I rarely cook every thing exactly to the recipe. But I like the new. Ideas and love not shopping. Plus it makes it really easy to share the cooking because my husband does prefer to cook to a recipe.\nOn the subject of using up broccoli, I make a pretty tasty broccoli pesto pasta. Basic recipe is chop & steam/boil a head of broccoli until tender. Drain off most of the liquid and put into a food processor with a few spoons/a small jar of basil pesto and whiz until chopped. Depending on what I have available I\u2019ll then cook some chicken or bacon (in the pot I cooked the broccoli in, because like you, I try to minimise the number of pots) then add the meat & broccoli pesto to a pot of cooked pasta (spirals work well). Serve with extra Parmesan cheese.\nPasta is usually one of our go-tos as well. In this case, we were out of spaghetti noodles!\nI tend to cook exactly to recipe, though I may omit or substitute particularly expensive or difficult to procure ingredients. If I cook completely off-book it\u2019ll be something simple like a stir-fry, omelette, or tostadas. If left to my own instincts, I tend to underestimate spice use, overcook red meat, and undercook white meat. I didn\u2019t really learn to really cook until late high school/college so it\u2019s not second nature for me.\nI never use a cookbook. IMHO, or maybe I don\u2019t have a sensitive enough palate, most of the recipes have a few core ingredients while the rest is generally expensive food onania (e.g., 2 micrograms of this thing that can be bought only in 2 lbs packs and costs $10,000). If you are an experienced cook, you understand what the core ingredients are, how they work together, and what they could potentially be substituted with. Occasionally I will make a brand new recipe from a book or more likely online, but even so I am very unlikely to follow it 100% (as I understand enough about how ingredients interact to know what\u2019s safe to omit and am neither likely to go shopping midweek for exotic ingredients nor crazy to spend money). So, yeah. tl; dr: never by the recipe.\nHow long have you been cooking? When did you start?\nI think I started cooking in high school. So over 25 years ago? Man, I\u2019m old. (I\u2019m 43 now).\nI love your definition of generally expensive food onania!\nFor a new dish I tend to look up the two or three best-sounding recipes and build a chimera; e.g. oh this recipe uses heavy cream (yay) but it needs lots of spices I don\u2019t have, but the other uses garam masala which I have, so let\u2019s see what\u2019s in garam masala and figure out how many tsp I need\u2026that was for tikka masala for last Thanksgiving.\nI got gout and so have been vegetarian for a year now, which forces me to be more creative in the kitchen. It\u2019s hard to get as much protein as I want and I end up eating lots of eggs and tofu, which are tasty, but I need to branch out more.\nMy parents had me helping in the kitchen since I was five and I remember breaking a wooden spoon in the mixer at maybe seven or eight so yeah, pretty young. My mom used recipes but my dad mostly didn\u2019t bother with them, so maybe that\u2019s where I get it. Somewhere I have a book called The Flavor Bible which is really more of a flavor thesaurus, i.e. saying which flavors go with which. It gave me some interesting ideas, but it\u2019s been in the garage since we moved a couple of years back. I should dig it out.\nI use the Flavor Bible pretty often for ideas: we have broccoli, we have prosciutto\u2026. anything tie them together?\nWhile I often build a chimera as you do, I now & then try following recipes more closely if there\u2019s an effect I want that I haven\u2019t been able to just come up with on my own. For instance, yesterday I followed a recipe to the letter for a crispy-skinned salmon fillet, as last time I tried without a recipe the skin never got crispy and I was annoyed. And if I\u2019m baking with new ingredients, follow a recipe; once I\u2019ve gotten comfortable with the ingredient I feel freer to experiment.\nI learned by following directions (my mother\u2019s directions by phone after school, and then recipes) and then by living with college roommates from Hawaii, Florida, CA, New Jersey, etc of various ethnic backgrounds. I learned some key things about Indian and Chinese food by listening to my roommates\u2019 mothers\u2019 directions by phone after school now that I think about it :) We definitely aimed for dish-efficiency unless we were aiming for epic.\nI\u2019m like you. I have a list of things I can make without recipes, and I use as few pots as possible (my husband is your husband with this and it drives me NUTS). I do like trying new foods by using recipes, but I often modify them (usually to simplify, but sometimes to complicate when it seems bland). I\u2019ve been enjoying cooking new dishes from recipes lately, just to find a few more things to add to our list.\nI love new recipes. I think I get most of the excitement in my life from food. I can\u2019t imagine eating the same thing every week, even though that would simplify things a lot.\nSo you mentioned empanadas above, which is a new one for us and seems very kid-friendly and budget friendly (modify with whatever ingredients arearound)\u2014-do you make your dough or is it easy to find pre-made dough in your area (I can\u2019t find it in our usual grocery stores). Making my own dough would nix this for me, I find the process tiring & tricky.\nPrior to that, I would make them with grocery store pie dough. It is very odd that your grocery store doesn\u2019t have it\u2013 back when I was growing up, storebrand pre-made pie dough was in the freezer section. Here it\u2019s both in the freezer section and you can get unfrozen flats from Pillsbury near the milk/cheese section. (IIRC, Pillsbury gets an America\u2019s Test Kitchen seal of approval for their pie dough.) Maybe ask someone at the grocery store if they\u2019re hiding it someplace?\nIn terms of city groceries: I don\u2019t think TJ\u2019s carries it, but whole foods does.\nI usually use a recipe when I am trying something new for the first time. After that, I pretty much think of it as a list of ingredients \u2013 which I write down because I can\u2019t remember them. A lot of my recipe cards are just lists of ingredients of things I made once or twice off the internet and liked enough to make again. I do usually write amounts in the lists, but most of the time I don\u2019t actually measure things when I\u2019m cooking.\nI started helping my mom and Grandma cook and bake when I was too small to remember. I do always measure when I bake!\nI don\u2019t usually measure wet ingredients because I hate having to wash the measuring utensils!\nWith some recipes I like measuring all the wet ingredients into a big Pyrex measuring thing and then using that as a mixing bowl if possible too. Works especially well for pancakes/waffles/cake batters/other pourables.\nYes \u2013 my mom used to do that. I really wish I had a 4- or 8-cup pyrex so I could do it, too. I should just buy them!\nI don\u2019t use cookbooks anymore, almost ever. I have subscribed to some cooking blogs for probably a decade and have saved and tagged recipes that appeal (some tags are: winter, meat, soup, potluck, tried & liked). I started this in the good old google reader days, and fortunately Feedly was the one blog reader that was able to accept imported tagged & saved articles.\nSo now if I feel like having soup, first I\u2019ll check my saved & tagged recipes to see if anything appeals. If not, I\u2019ll think about what I\u2019m interested in eating and then I\u2019ll search for a recipe, or several recipes. Sometimes I then use a recipe as a guide, or combine ideas from a few and wing it the rest of the way.\nI have access to grocery stores with tons of great bulk bin options, so I\u2019m able to get a few pinches of a specific spice for a quarter, which makes more-complexly-spiced recipes much more appealing.\nWe tend to do that with Penzey\u2019s spice catalog recipes these days\u2013 collect them and then check them first.\nYes, I also love buying my spices from the bulk bins. For spices I use a lot, they\u2019re cheap. And for spices I\u2019m just trying out, I can get just the amount I need for the recipe.\nI mostly cook without a recipe, but I have to have a recipe for chicken, fish and meat (exceptions: ground beef, bacon and sausage, and big hunks of pork or beef in the slow cooker) because during my formative learn-to-cook years (early 20s), I was too frugal to buy meat, and now I worry I am going to do something wrong, and lack the technical foundation I have with vegetarian cooking (where I\u2019m comfortable winging curries, stirfrys, soups, stuffed veg, bean/rice dishes, sauces, etc).\nI am always very excited when I get entire new techniques from recipes, but it takes repetition for it to stick. One is roasting cruciferous vegetables, which I didn\u2019t start doing until about 5 years ago when it became the trendy thing on food blogs. That is what I\u2019d do with a random head of broccoli. I read and enjoyed Tamar Adler\u2019s An Everlasting Meal, which is a non-recipe how-to-cook book. I think the Food52 people (Amanda Hesser and Merrill Stubbs) have a similar new book, but the excerpts I\u2019ve read seem too uptight to me.\nOne of our baking cookbooks, Baking with Julia, recommends mastering base recipes and building on those. DH mastered the pie dough a few years back, which is why it has become one of our regular rotations.\nThere was a brief period of time when I was really learning to cook (after voluntarily downsizing myself with attendant huge pay cut) that I enjoyed trying out new things in the kitchen. But even then, I think it was mostly my \u201clet\u2019s make the best of this\u201d approach. Eventually I realized that I was just making the best of things, while in truth the hassle and frustration (and, occasionally, expense) of trying new things far outweighed the pleasure.\nThe other person I feed is not very picky and I am even less so, will happily eat the same five things over and over again in order to reduce planning, shopping, cooking, and cleanup time.\nSo now I have a repertoire of simple preparations, mostly one-dish, of the sort where all prep ends up in the same place. I minimize tools and thus washing-up, because why wash more than I have to. There are tons of oven preparations that I simply never do because where we live now, the oven doesn\u2019t work. After we move, I may roast/bake things again.\nWhen I was living alone, I rarely used recipes and just made stuff up most of the time (very simple, pretty cheap, often things my mom made from memory as well). I cooked some with my mom when I was growing up, but not a lot \u2013 probably just enough to know my way around a kitchen pretty well, which is good enough! I mostly relied on easy to make things when I was a kid if I was on my own (mac & cheese, soup, etc.).\nDH is much more recipe-oriented and we like to cook together, so we usually each pick out a few recipes for the week and decide together what the plan is. I\u2019ve found that this tends to decrease the brainpower required to actually cook dinner, which has been really helpful in shifting the balance from take-out to cooking at home. I tend to minimize dishes and prep work, but that is less of a priority for DH. I happily let him chop vegetables since that\u2019s my least favorite thing!\nIt helps that my MIL loves sending us books, so she\u2019s found some great cookbooks for us that I wouldn\u2019t have picked up otherwise. We have a few staple websites that we tend to frequent for ideas, and I\u2019ve found Martha Stewart\u2019s Meatless cookbook and another book called Cook Without a Book to be really solid for a vegetarian. We\u2019ve been having fun with Mark Bittman\u2019s Kitchen Matrix lately. His How to Cook Everything series is super helpful for anyone wanting to be able to wing in instead of using recipes.\nWhen I\u2019m by myself I don\u2019t really cook at all. I live on tv dinners, microwaved potatoes, cereal, etc. Not very healthy at all.\nWith DH we do very much what you do, though we\u2019re trying to get the kids more involved as well.\nAutistic Youngest is an AVID cookbook collector. Used and new: she covets them all. She\u2019s gotten used to the idea that I approach cooking much more by the seat of my pants. The recipe is mostly a suggestion, to my mind, although I hew more closely to many recipes for baking as opposed to cooking. I have to admit that the internet has really winnowed down the number of cookbooks I\u2019ll consult. I have my recent Joy of Cooking (I sadly had to replace my thirty-year-old falling apart copy with the less-desirable update) and a few other volumes that I share with Youngest but otherwise, it\u2019s seat of my pants or variations on a theme.\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever done an actual recipe from Joy of Cooking, but it is a great reference for things like cooking times.\nIt\u2019s interesting that comments above seem to show a preference for recipes in men and against in women or perhaps a preference for recipes in newer cooks and against in more experienced cooks.\nI would say I have only a tiny repertoire of memorized baseline meals that can be modified, stuff like sandwiches, cereal (I mix healthy and sugary/tasty cereal together), omelets, shipwreck (scrambled eggs with stuff). Mostly, once I perfect a recipe, I keep using it as it is so that I always get good results. So I do that for things like spaghetti sauce, taco soup, and baked goods. I also know a bunch of subs that work in my pancake recipe, though I\u2019m now working on an instant pancake recipe for when I just want a little snack instead of a huge batch.\nI don\u2019t like trying new recipes because they are usually disappointing. Nor do I really like eating all the results while perfecting a recipe (except chocolate bread) such as all those terrible tomato soups that had to be turned into spaghetti and all those very wrong chicken tikka masalas, though I do. However, I love-love-love when I perfect a new recipe (cheesecake! pancakes!). I love saving money and not having to be dependent on specific food companies or restaurants. And I love figuring out things like the minimum amount of an unhealthy ingredient I need to have in order to still love the dish. But then I hate when a perfected recipe stops working (pie crust) or being good (chili). So I do try new recipes about once or twice a month.\nI use a shopping list to buy based on what I\u2019m going to make, but at the store, I will also or instead buy things that are on sale for which I have a use. I also try to keep staples stocked, regardless of my specific plans.\nI\u2019m not sure my answers to your questions are based on how or when I learned to cook, but some of my other strategies definitely are. I learned by watching my Mom as a kid and adult, taking home ec in junior high, and cooking at camping trips with the Girl Scouts. So I do understand the lingo in recipes (which, teaching a boyfriend how to cook, I realized is quite whacky). I also greatly appreciate high quality cooking tools (like sharp knives instead of dull knives, cheese graters instead of dull knives, and stainless steel pans instead of aluminum). But my definition of high quality is normal people\u2019s definition of mid-range or low quality (I still love my Revereware that my mom got me when I graduated from college).\nWhile camping, I decided I preferred the system where the cooks also did the cleanup over the system where some people cooked and different people did the dishes. This is because when the cooks are cleaning, they are much more careful about the messes they make. Also, when you\u2019re not cooking, it\u2019s very relaxing. Unfortunately, my boyfriend has always had roommates who will gladly wash SO MANY DISHES because they love his cooking, so he is not well trained at all. (And I don\u2019t like his cooking, but I promised to do all the dishes if he moved into my place because I have no dishwasher.) But I generally use only one bowl for baking, for example. First I mix the liquid ingredients in the bottom. Then I add the flour and other dry ingredients and kind of stir the dry ingredients around a bit before thoroughly stirring everything all together.\nAnother interesting thing I noticed: Most of my stovetop cooking involves stirring (chili, soup, sauces) where as most of my boyfriend\u2019s does not (hunks of meat, omelettes), so it makes sense that he wants heavy pans with even heating and that I don\u2019t care at all about that.\nSo in conclusion, I\u2019m not really a good cook, but I can make lots of things that I like. That sounds like a contradiction. I\u2019d say there\u2019s very little I have a feel for in the kitchen. And I definitely can\u2019t figure out most ingredients just by tasting the final product. But using recipes + experimentation has led to me being able to be happy with eating my own cooking.\nI have Revereware too and love it. The pots are so nice.\nWe had Revereware for a while (it was my husband\u2019s grandmother\u2019s set), but the problem was that the bottoms of the pots weren\u2019t flat, so they don\u2019t really work on a glass-top stove. We bought a house last year with a very nice glass-top stove, so we let my MIL have the Revereware back.\ncooking language is so specific! We started doing a recipe a week with the kid a couple years ago \u2013 though often during the school year he doesn\u2019t have time, so it\u2019s mostly a summer thing \u2013 and he\u2019s got a kids cookbook where none of the recipes are that hard but he\u2019s learning how recipes work, why the directions are in a certain order, and what things like sautee and dice mean.\nI use some recipes but almost always adjust them. Actually, the most commonly used recipes are ones I\u2019ve made up or adjusted and are sitting in a word doc on my computer. Things like chicken spinach enchiladas, creamed onions, etc. Even in baking, I make small adjustments. I\u2019ve been baking from scratch since early high school (my friends and I loved to experiment) so have a pretty solid handle on what I can swap out and still have an edible product. I have this amazing vegan chocolate cake recipe from WWII that is so flexible it\u2019s not even funny, so I mess with that a lot to make different flavors (like orange chocolate cake or cherry or whatever).\nRecipes are used for inspiration or new ideas. Same deal with watching the food network and checking out what is combined. Or for when I\u2019m making something I\u2019ve never made before, but I\u2019ll usually just follow the recipe one time.\nWe got a bunch of nice cookbooks for our wedding (not on the registry \u2014 just gifts). I love to look through for the pictures but have barely touched any of the recipes.\nI think I\u2019ve had that WWII vegan chocolate cake before!\nI\u2019m a recipe user. I do like to experiment and make up my own recipes, but then I keep notes so that I can replicate the same thing later. It might take me a few iterations to get my version how I like it, but once I do, I write it in the notebook I use for my own recipes and don\u2019t vary much after that.\nBut I don\u2019t really love cooking. I love baking, and so most of my processes are the ones that work best for baking. It is harder to adjust along the way in baking: once the thing is in the oven, you have few things you can do to rescue it. So once I figure out what works, I want to be sure I don\u2019t forget! This also means that a lot of my favorite recipes in cookbooks have notes scribbled in them.\nDH has done the iteration thing with chocolate chip cookies and several of his grandma\u2019s recipes. I\u2019ve always enjoyed his \u201cfailures\u201d!\nWe love writing in our cookbooks. Even DC2 does it in one of hir children\u2019s cookbooks.\nYes, notes are so great! I put whether I like it as is, what changes I\u2019ve tried and what the results were.\nI\u2019m also at a place where I\u2019m not using up food just because it was cheap today, but I\u2019ve found that a lot of stuff is only good at the time of year it\u2019s also cheap, because that\u2019s when it\u2019s ripe. So I mostly am still cooking for \u201cwhat was available this week\u201d.\nI use a cookbook to make changes to how I cook and try new things. So a few years ago we got a pressure cooker and cooked our way through Lorna Sass\u2019s Vegetarian Cooking Under Pressure. Last year I got AfroVegan and am (slowly! The recipes in it are complicated & time consuming by my standards) trying new things out of it, and simplifying the ones we like down to stuff we\u2019ll actually make regularly. A lot of what we eat is seasonal and I should go back to the recipe the first few times I make it in a year, because I don\u2019t remember as well as I think I do and that means sometimes stuff I know well and like, I forget something important and it doesn\u2019t taste as good as it should. But if I\u2019ve made it a few times recently I don\u2019t need the recipe even to glance at.\nBut in general I cook without a recipe and not all at once. It just feels like too big of a chore to do all the things for most recipes all at once, especially if they are different kinds of things (chopping and blanching and making a roux and baking something and frying something.) Like, if I were making pot pie it would be because we had leftover cooked chicken, and I would make pie crust one day and make enough to put a few balls in the freezer for other times, and on the day of I\u2019d just make the gravy & roll out hte dough and put pre-cooked things into it. I make a sauce from AfroVegan that is supposed to be like half a cup, but I make it in a several-cup quantity (otherwise the measuring & chopping and having to wash the blender just isn\u2019t worth it!) and then have a bunch in the freezer that I use up over time, either in the delicious recipe it\u2019s for or in other stuff because it\u2019s a great sauce. I made rice and beans yesterday and then ran out of time, so tonight I\u2019ll fry plantains and fish and we\u2019ll have it with rice and beans.\nAlso most recipes don\u2019t use up their ingredients and it makes me crazy. I don\u2019t want a half a bag of kale and 2/3 of a cabbage and half an onion in my fridge. So I make double on the sauteed kale and either we just eat that much, or I put half in the freezer for later. Or if i\u2019m going to chop an onion, I either put it all in or put half in the freezer so I don\u2019t have to chop onion next time.\nThis year we haven\u2019t been very good at getting things out of the freezer after they\u2019re in there. That\u2019s one of the reasons I wanted to eat down a bit. But we still have stuff from Thanksgiving, and not just Turkey broth.\nI gave away my chest freezer and living with the little freezer has made me way better about not hoarding food.\nWe don\u2019t have a chest freezer for precisely that reason.\nFor some things, I follow recipes religiously (Grandma\u2019s Borsch, where she told me to add vegetables in a certain order; pancakes; most types of baking). I do make some substitutions, but usually play it safe. If I am trying to make something totally new and exotic = I\u2019ll definitely follow a recipe.\nFor other things \u2013 I sort of have a sense of what would work and what would not. Most soups, salads, meatballs, roasted vegetables, fish fall into this \u201copen your mind\u201d category. I experiment, I throw in whatever we have in the fridge, I feel confident that whatever I do \u2013 the meal will turn out great. It usually does.\nI am definitely in the \u201cbase the next meal on whatever is already in the fridge/freezer\u201d camp. That\u2019s how I grew up :) I don\u2019t like meal planning and find it much easier to buys \u201cstock\u201d stuff that can yield various combinations of meat, fish, grains, and vegetables for meals throughout the week.\nPantry cooking is awesome. We do both because at the end of the day I am not generally feeling creative about food so we keep a list of suggestions on the fridge.\nI never learned to cook well so I start out with a strong reliance on recipes. I usually read at least five of them before I try a new recipe because I\u2019m trying to simplify it to something that my hands / energy level can handle. When I get comfortable with the base recipe, I start to mess around with it, and that bugs PiC who liked it well enough the first time.\nDid a big produce shop yesterday, picked up 2 broccoli crowns, 2 zucchini, 2 lbs of asparagus, 3 pounds of carrots, a thing of kale, and I have no idea what I intend to do with it except feed JuggerBaby more steamed broccoli for lunch.\nmmmm stirfry. That\u2019s my fav. No recipe for that for me, and I even make a homemade peanut sauce that is different every time. We love our stirfry around here. I do want to find more sauce ideas to use with it \u2014 as much as we love peanut sauce, it can get old.\nSweet and sour is a favorite around here (vinegar and a little sugar/honey/etc., though I shouldn\u2019t be having sugar). DH makes one with soy sauce that\u2019s pretty good out of one of the Help! My apartment has a kitchen books. And we\u2019ll use TJ\u2019s sauces in a bottle for red curry. I think we\u2019ll be having a jar of tikka masala over veggies and rice.\nI often make stirfry into pseudo bibimbap. After all the veggies are cooked, empty them into a bowl. In the same pan, fry an egg per person (or you can scramble, if you prefer). rice+veggies+egg on top, top as desired with mirin, sesame oil, soy sauce, rice vinegar, sriracha, and furikake or seaweed flakes (\u201crice sprinkles\u201d according to my 4-year-old). For best results, break the yolk and let it run down all over the rice and veggies.\nAlso, I LOVE asparagus and could eat it straight up. Snap the tails off, olive oil, coarse salt and pepper. Grill or spread in a single layer on a cookie sheet, roast at 375-400 degrees F until crisp-tender, devour and try not to burn your fingers too much.\n@fizzchick: We never do anything more complicated than that with asparagus because it\u2019s SO GOOD that way!\n\u201cHow To Cook Without A Book\u201d by Pam Anderson (not the actress!) in 2000. Teaches technique, with some \u201crecipe\u201d guidelines\u2014I bought Amazon copies for each of my daughters to have when they set up their own households\u2014gave up trying to find copies at used bookstores/thrift shops.\nThe one I came across wasn\u2019t that one\u2013 it didn\u2019t have such an obvious title (also: not Mark Bittman), which is why I can\u2019t find it. But How to cook without a book is extremely popular!"
