Holidays are fun, although maybe for some people who are very fanatical at work, holidays are the most boring thing. And tiring! But for those of us who miss holiday, it is certainly very enjoyable if we have already entered the holiday.\nIn this article, I would like to share my experience of staying overnight at SBS Resort Barelang at my holiday time.\nSBS Resort Barelang is one of tourist spot far from the crowds, close to the beach and nearby an icon of the city of Batam, is the complete package that I got.\nMy journey started from my beloved city, Batam. It takes around 1 hour from Batam Center to go to SBS Resort Barelang by car. For information, currently no public transportation here.\nSBS Resort Barelang is located in Sembulang, Galang, Batam City, Riau Islands 29481. Along the way, we cross Barelang Bridge, the iconic bridge of Batam. The journey will continue and cross total 4 bridges from 6 chain bridges of Barelang.\nThe resort is located just before Barelang 5th bridge which also known as Tuanku Tambusai bridge. The bridge is visible from the resort as well.\nA quite tiring journey, finally rewarded with a very beautiful view, the Wooden Board that reads SBS Camp welcomed us, as long as our eyes looked, nothing we regretted, all these sights, were very beautiful, we never ceased to give thanks to the Almighty for the Gift this is very beautiful.\nOkay we decided to come in, and find information about this SBS Resort, in the process of finding information we got information from the SBS Assistant Manager, that there were 10 villas provided at SBS Resort, and it was a new building, because it was only inaugurated September 25 2017.\nWe also found a Seafood Restaurant, according to the information the Seafood Restaurant has just opened on August 17, 2017, if seen from this year the Seafood Restaurant has been in operation for one year.\nThis Seafood Restaurant is at the Stage House that I mentioned above, and provides many Seadfood dishes, and some of the favorites there are, Hepo BlackPaper, Crab Sauce Padang, Tochiu Steam Grouper and also Salted Egg Cutters.\nFrom where we eat, we can enjoy the magnificent view of 5th Barelang bridge or Tuanku Tambusai bridge. We enjoy a very beautiful sunset, when the evening approaches.\nOur assessment, for the design of this room is very unique, to enter the Villa there are two doors, the first door from the front and the second door from the front of the living room, when we open the door from the living room, we find the toilet room, and new room.\nThe next day, we enjoy the watersport at SBS Resort beach. There were kayak, banana boat, snorkeling, island tour and else. First, we try kayak, because me and my partner want to race rowing in the SBS beach area.\nSea water at SBS Resort was quite calm at that time, we were still advised to use life jacket all the time. Just in case.\nHaving tired of enjoying the many Watesport at SBS Resort, we both relax on the beach enjoying the calm scenery and warm sun, under the tent. I personally don\u2019t want my skin to be darker. It\u2019s darker enough right now hahaha.\nFor your information, at SBS Resort also provides a place called Barak. That place is specifically for those of you who come with a group, this barracks can fit up to 10 people. This Barak concept, is far different from Villa, this Barak is more like a Camp. Suitable for gathering with family or large group.\nBelow is price list for water villa and water sport."
