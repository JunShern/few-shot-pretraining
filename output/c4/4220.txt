    "text": "What is God up to in the world? Why is God redeeming and rescuing people, communities and the whole earth?\nWritten by Alice Shirey on 01 September 2014 .\nThis is a beautiful image - the human soul desiring God and seeking after him with all that is within us. And God, we are promised, wants to be found, and even promises to be found. A strong motivating force.\n\"So long as we imagine it is we who have to look for God, we must often lose heart. But it is the other way around - He is looking for us.\"\nWhen I find myself feeling far from God, when I am not a very good seeker, when the \"far country\" I often live in feels too far, I rest in this heart-stopping truth - the God who is called \"the hound of heaven\" never, ever stops seeking after me.\nHe never, ever stops seeking after you.\nWritten by Alice Shirey on 02 September 2014 .\nIn the Old Testament, a trio of people are often cited as deserving special protections from God and God\u2019s people \u2026 The fatherless, the widow, the orphan. Often, the foreigner is added to this list.\nGod knew these people were at risk in the society of the Old Testament \u2026 at risk to be marginalized, neglected, oppressed, victimized, even killed.\nAnd so God commanded his people to take special care of these particular people in their midst. He gave special commandments, even made special rules that protected them, gave them chances to enter mainstream society again, helped them escape the noose of generational poverty, protected them from oppression and violence.\nWho are the marginalized among us today?\nMight they not fit into this same descriptive trio (or quartet)? The fatherless, the widow, the orphan, the foreigner.\nIt matters not your political persuasion, if you are a follower of God, you are to live in such a way that you protect the marginalized, speak up for them, watch out for them, care for them, serve them, give to them, pray for them.\nOften, when confronted with the marginalized in our midst, we hope for someone else to help them.\nWritten by Alice Shirey on 23 September 2014 .\nTo be honest, I was really disappointed by the answers.\nThey were almost all kind of individualistic in nature.\nMany of them were violent and kind of \u201cend-times\u201d oriented \u2026 the idea that all God cared about was getting a bunch of individuals into heaven before he blew the rest of the world to bits.\nThere were no answers that seemed big enough to be God\u2019s, you know?\nMy heart and soul were uninspired.\nAnd so I went searching, both in the Bible and from great thinkers: Where could I find a richer, deeper, truer understanding about what God\u2019s mission is in this messed up world?\nI went back to one of the modern day classics, NT Wright\u2019s book, Simply Christian, which many compare to CS Lewis\u2019 classic, Mere Christianity.\n\u201cChristianity is about the belief that the Living God, in fulfillment of his promises and as the climax of the story of Israel, has accomplished all this \u2013 the finding, saving, the giving of new life \u2013 in Jesus. He has done it.\nWith Jesus, God\u2019s rescue operation has been put into effect once and for all. A great door has swung open in the cosmos which can never again be shut. It\u2019s the door to the prison where we\u2019ve been keep chained up.\nWe are offered freedom: freedom to experience God\u2019s rescue for ourselves, to go through the open door and explore the new world to which we now have access.\nIn particular, we are all invited \u2013 summoned, actually \u2013 to discover, through following Jesus, that this new world is indeed a place of justice, spirituality, relationship and beauty, and that we are not only to enjoy it as such but to work at bringing it to birth on earth as in heaven.\nNow that \u2026 that motivates me!\nWritten by Alice Shirey on 05 November 2014 .\nTonight our A Way of Life class is discussing the chapter from the first manual on worship.\nI am going to share some of his thoughts over the next few days.\nExpect to be disturbed, but in a good way.\nLabberton is the new President at Fuller Seminary and I have loved everything I have seen from him. He has a huge heart for Jesus, for the church, and for the radical demands of the Gospel.\n\u201cWhen worship is our response to the One who alone is worthy of it \u2013 Jesus \u2013 then our lives are on their way to being turned inside out. Every dimension of self-centered living becomes endangered as we come to share God\u2019s self-giving heart.\nWorship exposes our cultural and even spiritual complacency toward a world of suffering and injustice.\nIn Jesus Christ, we are called into a new kind of living. Through the grace of worship, God applies the necessary antidote to what we assume is merely human \u2013 our selfishness.\nWorship sets us free from ourselves to be free for God and God\u2019s purposes in the world.\nWell now \u2026 Do you think his definition of worship might be just a tad bigger than ours?\nWritten by Alice Shirey on 03 December 2014 .\nTwo years ago we went to South Africa to visit my daughter who was studying at the University of Cape Town.\nThe natural beauty was jaw-dropping.\nThe culture was rich and fascinating.\nBut the spirit of the place was something I had never felt before.\nThere was a vague sense of dread in the air. Everything felt a tad unsafe. Unsettled. Unmoored. Festering.\nThe bed and breakfast at which we stayed had multiple locked, gated entries.\nWe had to buzz in to a really nice restaurant \u2026 the neighborhood was too dangerous to have an unlocked entrance.\nMy daughter\u2019s home had a security guard. If she was at the library late at night, she always called a car to drive her home.\nOn a wine tour just outside a township, we got stuck in a traffic jam and armed guards showed up on the edges of the highway, protecting us from possible car-jacking.\nThis was South Africa 20 years after the horror of apartheid.\n\u201cThe sins of the fathers \u2026\u201d is what I kept thinking of.\nTo see black and brown people living in shanty towns that spread as far as the eye could see, while white people lived in relative luxury \u2026 well, it was just shocking.\nBut it should be no more shocking to me than living here. I guess sometimes you have to travel to begin to see your own situation with new eyes.\nIt was Christians who brought apartheid to South Africa. They thought God condoned it; even mandated it.\nAs a Christian in America today, I wonder what role I might be playing in the pain and suffering of my neighbors.\nOf all the questions I might ask myself these days, this might be one of the most important.\nWritten by Alice Shirey on 29 December 2014 .\nI taught yesterday at one of our satellite venues.\nI stated that the way the incarnation happened demonstrates (as does almost all of Jesus\u2019 life) that God's heart, as Philip Yancey writes, tilts toward the underdog.\nAfter the service, a woman approached me quite vigorously as I tried to sneak out to get home to my family and my warm and comfortable home.\nIf God is for the poor, like you said he is, why am I still poor?\nWhy doesn\u2019t my car start?\nWhy does my heat get shut off and no one seems to care?\nCheezy smile \u2026 hoping this answer will appease.\n\u201cWell, that is no help to me,\u201d she said.\nWhen I got home I told Chuck that Jesus had confronted me about how smoothly words about God\u2019s concern for the poor had dribbled out of my middle-class mouth from the pulpit.\nWritten by Alice Shirey on 05 January 2015 .\nI have been wanting to teach an entire series on the Pharisees for some time.\nPerhaps the time is now.\nWritten by Alice Shirey on 06 January 2015 .\n\u201cIt is unearned love \u2013 the love that goes before, that greets us on the way.\nIt\u2019s the help you receive when you have no bright ideas left, when you are empty and desperate and have discovered that your best thinking and most charming charm have failed you.\nIs your life at its core filled with grace or un-grace?\nWritten by Alice Shirey on 21 January 2015 .\nGrace, my friends \u2026 grace!\none sip of which could convince anyone that God saves us single-handedly.\nOh, isn\u2019t that good news, my friends?\nWill you live in that truth today?\nIt is not up to you or to me \u2026 thank you, Jesus!\nWritten by Alice Shirey on 24 January 2015 .\nWhenever I need to be reminded of the unconditional, unearned grace of God, I read Brennan Manning.\nA grace that pays the eager beaver who works all day long the same wages as the grinning drunk who shows up at ten till five.\nThis vulgar grace is indiscriminate compassion.\nGrace is sufficient even though we huff and puff with all our might to try to find something it cannot cover.\nMay you live this weekend fully drenched in the grac e of God!\nWritten by Alice Shirey on 27 January 2015 .\nWhat really separates us from God?\nIs it sin, or something else?\nI have been pondering this question lately.\n\"Our misdeeds are not the real root of the problem. They are just what the tradition called actual sins.\nThere is a much more serious problem, what the tradition called original sin.\nIt is much more subtle and inevitably hidden from us.\nThe relationship is broken by the presumption of our ethical behavior, our morality, our good deeds, our insistence on doing it ourselves.\nThe Almighty God desires simply to be known as the giver of the gift of absolute grace.\nTo this we say \"No.\"\nThen the relationship is destroyed just as surely as it was by our immorality.\"\nHave you ever pondered the thought that it is your own self-created \"goodness\" that keeps you from God?\nWritten by Alice Shirey on 13 February 2015 .\nSo often, we are told to think of the Bible as some kind of instruction manual.\nI believe that is a description that belittles the majesty of Scripture. It also belittles the difficulty most of us have when reading the Bible.\nDon't get me wrong: there are commands in there.\n\"Finally, I think it is possible to say that in spite of all its extraordinary variety, the Bible is held together by having a single plot.\nGod creates the world, the world gets lost; God seeks to restore the world to the glory for which he created it.\nso you might say that what holds it together more than anything else is us.\nit is the one that more than any other - and in more sense than one - also holds us together.\"\nGod creates the world, the world gets lost; God seeks the restore the world (all of it) to the glory for which he created it.\nSounds much more exciting, fascinating, complicated and compelling than reading an instruction manual.\nWritten by Alice Shirey on 17 March 2015 .\nDoing some great reading on GRACE for my Easter teaching... and stumbled upon this beautiful statement.\n\"The gospel liberates us to be okay with not being okay. We know we're not - though we try very hard to convince other people we are. But the gospel tells us, \"Relax, it is finished\"\nBecause of the gospel, we have nothing to prove or protect.\nThe gospel frees us from trying to impress people, to prove ourselves to people, to make people think we're something that we're not.\nThe gospel frees us from what one writer calls \"the law of capability\" - the law, he says, \"that judges us wanting if we are not capable, if we cannot handle it all, if we are not competent to balance our diverse commitments without a slip.\"\nThe gospel grants us the strength to admit we're weak and needy and restless - knowing that Christ's finished work has proven to be all the strength and fulfillment and peace we could ever want, and more.\nThe gospel frees us from the urge to self-gain, to push ourselves forward for our own purposes and agenda and self-esteem.\nWhen you understand that your significance and identity and purpose and direction are all anchored in Christ, you don't have to win - you're free to lose.\nAnd nothing in this broken world can beat a person who isn't afraid to lose!\nYou'll be free to say crazy, risky, counterintuitive stuff like, \"To live is Christ, and to die is gain\" (Phil. 1:21)! That's pure, unadulterated freedom.\nSince Jesus is our strength, our weaknesses don't threaten our sense of worth and value.\nNow we're free to admit our wrongs and weaknesses without feeling as if our flesh is being ripped off our bones.\"\nNow, take a deep breath... and live your day free and forgiven! It is finished. It is not up to you. Thank God!\nWritten by Alice Shirey on 16 April 2015 .\nWritten by Alice Shirey on 24 April 2015 .\nWhich is what Jesus often did.\nAnd, remember who he offended most?\nThose who thought they were \"in.\"\nThose who thought they knew who were \"out.\"\nSee what you think. It is a catchy little song.\nWritten by Alice Shirey on 03 May 2015 .\n\"How did the word evangelical become the antithesis of grace?\"\nWritten by Alice Shirey on 14 May 2015 .\nIf you seek God alone, then that which is from God in others will come alive, whether or not you can see it.\nJesus sees what is of God in others, even if it is still hidden as a tiny seed.\nThis is the gospel you must proclaim.\nJesus values each person; he sees their dignity as God created them.\nHe came to rid every person of shame and self-contempt, of the feeling that they are nothing and can do nothing, the feeling that they have ruined everything and nothing can change that, the feeling that all is hopeless.\nWritten by Alice Shirey on 17 May 2015 .\n'Give them something to eat.'\"\nWritten by Alice Shirey on 20 June 2015 .\nI am so shocked and saddened by the death of 9 saints from a South Carolina church.\nSuch a waste of beautiful human life.\nI listened to the relatives of these victims speak at the bond hearing for the young murderer.\nAnd I stood at attention in my kitchen as I heard their agonized voices whisper words of forgiveness to this young man who was so filled with hate and ignorance... And who shot old ladies, and a state senator and pastor, at a simple Bible study.\n\"Their minister (who was one of the men killed) did an amazing job pastoring these folks. These people responded to hatred in the name and the power and in the way of Jesus, the great forgiver and reconciler.\"\nI smiled, even in the midst of my tears.\nI continued to stand in attention (and reverence) in my kitchen for quite some time... just pondering these responses in my heart.\nOh, that I would have this kind of response in the face of earth-shattering hatred.\nWritten by Alice Shirey on 22 June 2015 .\nWere devoted to one another?\nRegarded one another as more important than oneself?\nDid not speak against one another?\nDid not judge one another?\nShowed tolerance for one another?\nWere kind to one another?\nSpoke truth to one another?\nUrged one another on to love and good deeds?\nWhat if that is all we did?\nHow different might the church look in today's world if we just focused on those things?\nWhat is God up to in the world? Why is God redeeming and rescuing people, communities and the whole earth? What is his end game? How can I participate with him?"
