Opioid deaths had passed 30,000 in 2015 and the recent heroin boom increased further with ongoing attempts at restricting traditional opioids. For the first time, there were more heroin deaths than gun homicides.\nA sobering end to my trip. Maybe crisis will evoke change?\nI would say that there\u2019s nothing that will actually change. Have you noticed the shift in any acknowledgement of the scientific method? By the way, laxatives are already being touted for opioid use.\nIn my estimation, the battle is already over. The absence of any use of \u201cpain science\u201d began this.\nI suspect until we humans, en masse, start to better understand ourselves and what drives our behaviour, substantial change in such a context may well be very difficult. Having said that, there are countries around the world which deal with these issues arguably far better than others. So are there any reasons why we can\u2019t learn from them ?\n1. Berridge K.
