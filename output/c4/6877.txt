    "text": "How would you describe your mood in the morning? If the first words that come to mind are \u201csluggish\u201d or \u201ccranky\u201d, then it might be time to take action. The benefits of being a morning person are numerous. Ultimately, it comes down to giving yourself the best foundation to make the most of your day.\nWe understand that becoming a morning person can be easier said than done, but there are actually a number of things you can do to help to seize the day.\nThis need cannot be stated often enough. If you aren\u2019t getting strong, restful sleep, becoming a better morning person is going to be borderline impossible. Stick to a consistent sleep schedule, and do everything you can to grab between seven and nine hours of quality sleep per night.\nA good way to keep the morning momentum moving forward is to create a reliable, realistic, and flexible routine for your mornings, as well. This means that a good morning routine is one that you can take with you wherever you go, which can be particularly useful for those of us who need to travel a lot for work.\nNaps can be tremendously beneficial, but they can also throw a wrench into your normal sleep schedule. For instance, if a 30-minute nap improves your energy during the day and allows you to get to bed at your normal time, it would be considered a functional nap. However, if that nap leaves you feeling groggy and pushes your bed time back by 30 minutes to an hour, then this would be counterproductive. In this case, you should either shorten your nap, or consider only doing it occasionally.\nIt may be tempting to skip out on breakfast. However, taking breakfast seriously is a great way to give you the energy you need to get your mornings started on the right foot. Look for something that is simple and healthy, and matches your hunger and appetite in the morning. For instance, some people can\u2019t eat for the first 60-90 minutes that they\u2019re awake \u2013 that\u2019s fine! Plan for a later breakfast.\nHaving a single goal to guide you at the start of your day is a great way to get your mind moving in the right direction when you wake up."
