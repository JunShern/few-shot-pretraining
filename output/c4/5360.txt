    "text": "Celebrating my $25 windfall courtesy of Borderlands, Ange and I took the kinderlings out for a $70 dinner last night (numbers were never my strong point).\nThis morning, I prepared a hitlist of potential markets to tap overseas. I figure if I plan to attack the US publishing scene with Harbinger, they may as well know who I am. Of course, I need to make a few more sales in Australia (although Andromeda Spaceways and Ticonderoga Online are looking promising at the moment).\nOne thing I found with my list (courtesy of ralan.com, and a few other sources), is there are precious few big paying professional mags that cater to horror. The big boys seem to like Fantasy and Sci-Fi better. I guess I\u2019ll just prosititute myself a little and diversify.\nIt\u2019s strange, but on the subject of story genre, Ange asked me about it this morning. I had previously told her I was a fantasy writer, yet she picked up on the fact that the majority of my short stories are horror. In my heart, I know I am a fantasy writer \u2013 that years of reading sword and sorcery (and dare I say it, playing Dungeons & Dragons) have turned me into a someone who knows the difference between a broadsword and a longsword. Yet here I am, with most of a supernatural horror/thriller/action novel completed, with potentially another three planned after that, and a plethora of short stories, almost exclusively horror. Something didn\u2019t turn out right?\nI pin it down on a couple of things. First of all, any ideas I\u2019ve had in the realms of fantasy were always vast in scope \u2013 epic adventures and cataclysmic battles. Too big for a short story. The other thing is, I started the prologue for Harbinger years ago, then left it. Somehow, the story, and the mythos, ignited by that prologue has been haunting me ever since. I need to complete the novel (and the series) to find peace from the tormenting dream demons that whisper \u201cHarbinger\u201d every night. Finally, I just keep coming up with good (to my mind) and creepy stories. It\u2019s just coincidental they\u2019re all horror.\nI have to say the supernatural is really my underlying theme, it translates well into horror, and okay into fantasy. While I have a cool idea or two for sci-fi novels, the genre itself holds little interest to me."
