    "text": "There is an old saying \u201cclear desk, clear mind\u201d. Whether it\u2019s work, our home or our bedroom, our environment can have a huge impact on our wellbeing. Cutting down the number of \u2018things\u2019 in your life, means you become less distracted by thoughts such as \u201cI should find a home for that, this needs to be fixed, I don\u2019t really like that, but it was a gift\u201d etc. These are just extra thoughts about \u2018things\u2019, which you don\u2019t need mentally or physically.\nWhen you have fewer things, but things you love, tidily displayed, it is easier to enjoy your surroundings and relax! Who doesn\u2019t feel happier in a fresh, clean and light space?\nThe BEST thing about it is saving time searching for lost things and tidying. Searching for things and trying to clean a cluttered room / home / office is time consuming and actually quite draining! Yes, cleaning can in itself be a mindful activity, but not when it is a never-ending, unbeatable battle against the clutter!\nMany people keep things as memories or for sentimental reasons and that\u2019s OK, but consider which items really add VALUE to your life. Marie Kondo, the tidying guru, recommends you hold each item and keep it only if it \u2018sparks joy\u2019.\nFreeing yourself from existing clutter, means time and freedom are regained, time which could be spent making memories with friends, going somewhere new or doing some exercise or a hobby.\nNot BUYING clutter, reducing the amount of \u2018stuff\u2019 coming into your home, therefore frees up your time and funds to DO and experience new things that make you far richer.\n1) Set yourself a treat.\nAt the end of this I will have a cup of tea, head out to the cinema or perhaps buy a beautiful, fresh bunch of flowers or plant to finish off the new space.\n2) Get Some Music on!\nFind some tunes to make you feel upbeat and motivated. Time will whizz past as you work away while singing or even dancing along.\nBefore you start, stand in the doorway or corner of the room and take a good look around. Think about what your friends/parents see when they stand in the same place, looking into your room! What is the first thing you notice?\n\u00b7 Recycling \u2013 paper, plastics etc. in here!\n\u00b7 Rubbish - things broken beyond repair, food waste etc.\n\u00b7 Donation / sell / re-gift \u2013 things in good condition that someone else could use. This includes new items you\u2019ll never realistically wear / use!\n\u00b7 Have I outgrown this?\n\u00b7 Do I really need this item? Have I used it in the last 12 months?\n\u00b7 Does it spark any joy for me?\n\u00b7 Is this item just taking up space or do I (not will I) actually use it?\nReally go for it! Be positive about each thing you free your space from. You\u2019ll have this done in no time. Each item out is one step closer to a tidier, healthier space and mind!\nWhen you\u2019ve finished, give it a quick vacuum, dust and RELAX.\nHayley Barnard is confirmed as the guest speaker for the Shine Health and Wellbeing event 2019!"
