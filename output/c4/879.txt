    "text": "Can Medical Marijuana Actually Assist With Rough Hangovers?\nSpending a night out with your friends is always a good time, but the morning after is not always a bed of roses. Too often, going hard at the club or the bar will result in a massive headache and upset stomach the next day. However, what if there was a way to reduce the effects of a hangover? While there are plenty of products on the market today, one might be the best of them all: medical cannabis. Let\u2019s see what discoveries are being made about this potential cure.\nBefore we can decide if weed can cure this ailment, we first have to understand how it works. After a hard night of drinking, your body requires two things to feel refreshed and get back to normal. First, you need to rehydrate as alcohol saps your body of water. Second, you have to flush all of the toxic chemicals out of your system. Until both of those things happen, you won\u2019t be rid of your hangover.\nWell, it should be clear that smoking a joint will not rehydrate your cells, nor will it expunge the alcohol from your body. So why would it ever be considered a hangover cure? Well, two reasons. First, it helps you feel better, so you are not in as much pain (particularly in your head). Second, it can alleviate your nausea and help you eat and drink. Since water is necessary to beat your hangover, this can be a game changer.\nIf you want the ultimate in convenience, then you should look into getting your weed delivered. After a night of partying, you won\u2019t have the energy or stamina to go to the nearest dispensary. Instead, look for marijuana delivery near me and hit them up for some sweet relief.\nOverall, weed won\u2019t cure your hangover, but it will make it a lot more tolerable. The only thing to remember is to smoke a little bit; it\u2019s never a good idea to be hungover and high.\nWhat Is the Connection Between Ethics and Social Media?"
