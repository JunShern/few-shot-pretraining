    "text": "APPLETON \u2013 Ed Berthiaume, news director at The Post-Crescent, will step down from his post early next year after 29 years with the news organization.\nBerthiaume, 56, voluntarily accepted an early retirement package from Gannett Co. Inc., which operates the USA TODAY Network and owns the Fox Valley news operation.\n\u201cI\u2019ve shared the newsroom with colleagues who had a passion for journalism and a desire to pursue their work with integrity. That was true when I arrived in 1989 and it\u2019s true today. I\u2019ve been blessed,\u201d Berthiaume said.\nBerthiaume worked as a reporter from 1989 to 1994 before being named features editor. He served in multiple newsroom management roles over the next 24 years.\nHe has been leading The Post-Crescent newsroom and serving on the USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin leadership team since February 2015, first as content director and interim news director before being named news director in April 2017.\nJim Fitzhenry, vice president of News for the USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin, will oversee the newsroom until a successor is named.\n\"This is a bittersweet moment for us,\" Fitzhenry said. \"The early retirement package will allow Ed to pursue his next great adventure, but we will miss his vast knowledge of the Fox Cities and Wisconsin. I don't think I've worked with a more complete journalist. He handles so many things so well.\"\nHe cited the 2002 opening of the Fox Cities Performing Arts Center and the early coverage of the Mile of Music festival in Appleton as two highlights of his career.\nFormer Post-Crescent editor Dan Flannery said Berthiaume made a positive impact on the community and will be missed.\n\"Over the course of 28-plus years at The Post-Crescent, it was my honor to work with some exceptional journalists \u2014 people who were committed to doing their best work every time they were called on to tell the stories of our community.\nFlannery said Berthiaume has a strong commitment to the community and has shown his passion for the Fox Cities and its people.\n\u201cThe Post-Crescent has been far better for this community with Ed Berthiaume in its newsroom, he said."
