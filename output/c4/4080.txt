Prior to contracting your services, I had contacted a number of other outfits, who were rather dismissive of the value in the estate articles. That Treasure Evermore was able to more than double their sales estimates is a ringing endorsement of your acumen over these other amateurs.\nI attribute this accomplishment to your expertise in the three cornerstones of estate sales: effective marketing to a wide network of regular customers and commercial buyers, intelligent, aesthetic and effective staging of the sale items and continual restaging during the event, and, most importantly, the efforts of numerous motivated, personable and engaging sales personnel. Since nothing ever sells by itself, liberal commissions are essential for high volume. I was truly astounded at some of the prices that were paid for objects that I thought would have to be hauled away.\nThank you for taking care of a complicated and quite emotional event with alacrity and \u00e9lan.\nI was so pleased with not only in-house sale, but the help you gave me in emptying out my home of 50+ years.\nAfter a few days I thought of you as family. You did more for me and my chiildren then I had ever expected and we all say we couldn't have gotten the job done without you.\nNot only were you fun to be with but you handled the task with respect and honesty.\nAnd thanks too for Cindy's picture hanging session in my new home.I love the effect.\nWe worked with Mara on a total concept sales initiative. Estate sale through to closing.\nShe was very knowlegable and seemed to know the ins and outs even when things were challenging. She defenitly demonstrates a keen sense regarding her role within the sales initiative Her experience is evident in all aspects of the sales cycle."
