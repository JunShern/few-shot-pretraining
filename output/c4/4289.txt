So, these are some things \u0422\u044b can say \u0438\u043b\u0438 do when he insults you. Let's get this \u0421\u043f\u0438\u0441\u043e\u043a started!\n1.If he calls \u0422\u044b a Mudblood, say \"At least I'm no bleached blonde.\"\n2. If he makes fun of \u0422\u044b for being bad at Quidditch, get the Snitch from right under his nose and don't let him forget it.\n8. Sneak a Puking Pastille into his dinner-- JUST the part that makes \u0422\u044b sick.\n9. \"Say that one \u0435\u0449\u0435 time \u0422\u044b blondie, I dare you!\"\n11. Make a sympathetic face and say, \"Aww, poor baby. Did \u0422\u044b run out of good insults? Maybe daddy can buy \u0422\u044b some new ones.\"\n12. Say, Are \u0422\u044b naturally stupid? \u0438\u043b\u0438 do \u0422\u044b practice?\"\n13. \"Your insults have gotten that weak, Malfoy? \u0422\u044b father will be hearing about this, and I don't think he'll be too happy.\" Then exit laughing.\n14. Wear an Invisibility Cloak, sneak up behind him, and whisper, \"I'm coming for \u0422\u044b Draco... Beware\"\n15. Say, \"Is that the best insult \u0422\u044b could come up with? What's wrong- forgot all the old ones? Wish \u0422\u044b had a Remembrall like Longbottom's now, don't you?\"\n18. If he calls \u0422\u044b an insulting word, say \"Oooh, Draco, sorry, but it's kind of hard to get insulted by a boy who runs to his daddy to fight his battles.\" Then just turn and walk away.\n20. Gasp and point at him, and say to someone beside you, \"Did \u0422\u044b know the \u0445\u043e\u0440\u0435\u043a could talk?\""
