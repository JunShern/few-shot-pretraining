    "text": "Hi everyone! I hope you are all having a wonderful holiday season! My Christmas was one of the best ever! I loved seeing the reactions of the little grands...priceless! Now it's time to move on to New Year's and all that the beginning of a new year brings!\nAnd I am excited because the end of the month also means that it's time for the monthly share from our Country French design group...and this time the subject is tables! I am showing you how I created a New Year's tablescape with a Country French flair! You can see how I did it here.\nAnd stay tuned because in a few days I will be revealing my top ten posts from 2014...all favorites picked by you, my readers!\nOur host this week is Suzy from Worthing Court.\nHi everyone! I'm so happy to be your host this week. I hope your holiday was a joyful one and that Santa filled your stocking with everything that you hoped for!\nNow it's time to put all that stuff away. Ugh. That was a tough one for me until I figured out an easy and common sense approach to storing and organizing my decorations. Give this method a try. Next year, you'll be glad that you did.\nAs usual, it was so hard to select just a few links from last week's party to feature.\nKari from Thistlewood Farm has a beautiful office. She shared a tutorial for How To Build A Raised Panel Wall.\nKarin from Art Is Beauty did a fabulous makeover on an $8 garage sale find.\nBarb, from A Life In Balance, shared wonderful ideas for a kid-friendly New Year's Eve. I love the free printable that she created.\nOh my, this could be dangerous. Strangers & Pilgrims shared the recipe for her \"Almond Joy\" Body Scrub. It looks good enough to eat.\nChristmas may be over, but there's still plenty of hot chocolate drinking weather to go. Shannon from AKA Design put together a wonderful hot chocolate bar.\nAnd now\u2026let's see what you have to share this week!\nBy linking up you are agreeing that the photos are yours or that you have permission to use them, and that we may use those photos to feature your project on a blog post, Facebook, Pinterest, or Twitter, or Instagram.\nYour French flair New Year's table is just gorgeous Debbie! Thanks so much for the party today!\nLove your French table setting - so pretty! Thanks for hosting.\nLovely country table scape, a real beauty my friend. Thank you to all of you lovely and gracious hostesses for having the party up for us all of 2014 and looking forward to joining the fun in 2015.\nThank you for hosting 2014. Looking forward to 2015!!\nDebbie, I just want to take a minute to thank you for co-hosting the Scoop throughout the year. Your teaching approach, thrifty ideas and love of Quimper have inspired me in ways you'll never know. Your first-hand knowledge of France and their way of living captures my attention continuously, and I look forward to following and learning more from you in 2015. Cheers!\nThanks for hosting Debbie! Happy New Year!\nWhat a lovely table! Thanks so much for hosting."
