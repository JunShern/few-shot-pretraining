    "text": "The Summer of Love \u2014 1967 \u2014 served as the epicenter of the counter-culture, beckoning thousands of young people to the San Francisco Bay Area. Flower Power was up, war was down, the Monterey International Pop Festival served as a precursor to Woodstock, and two young sound enthusiasts named John and Helen, went on a date at a Berkeley hi-fi shop to hear The Beatles seminal, psychedelic Sgt. Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band.\nThat same year, John Meyer was tapped by Steve Miller to develop a better sound system for the blues rocker\u2019s Monterey Pop performance. While it would be another decade before Meyer Sound was formally founded, this formative period laid the cornerstones for a company that would blaze sonic trails, and provide innovative audio experiences, decade after decade, from the analog into the digital ages.\nThroughout 2017, to celebrate their love, and the 50th anniversary of the Summer of Love, John and Helen Meyer will visit key Meyer Sound customers, host exclusive curated events in Meyer Sound environments at the company\u2019s Berkeley, California campus, in the San Francisco Bay Area, around the US, and around the world. John and Helen will highlight their innovative, handcrafted audio products, systems and ideas \u2014 for live music of all genres in concert halls and stadiums, corporate settings, educational arenas, theatres, houses of worship, restaurants, cinema post-production and exhibition, fine art projects, and more.\nWhile Meyer Sound can be experienced in many places around the world, the magic truly comes to life in a personal behind-the-scenes tour of the factory and laboratories with the company\u2019s co-founders, and other key members of the Meyer Sound family, in Berkeley. The world\u2019s most notable sound designers and engineers leave amazed by the artistry, passion and vision that goes into every system and sound concept. As part of the celebration this year, the gates to the campus will open to a few lucky guests through a contest for an all-expense paid trip to visit Meyer Sound in Berkeley. Details to be announced soon. As a central hub for information about Meyer Sound innovation, products, ideas, and the Summer of Love 50th anniversary celebration details, the new Meyer Sound website launches today: meyersound.com."
