Good luck building your own 3D Solar Panel System Huzefa.\nThis book is great. We were looking at getting some solar panels, but we are renting. As such our landlord won\u2019t let us put battens and then solar panels on our roof. Due to the cost, we would definitely want to take them with us to the next house. This product solves that problem for us. Thanks for letting us know about it. My question to you is how do you attach them back into the mains power on your house? Do you need an electrician or is it a different circuit only?\nI\u2019m glad that you like the DIY 3D Solar Panels Guide. There is lots of valuable information making your 3D Solar Panel project much easier to complete.\nEven though you are in a rental property you can still use the 3D Solar Panel System to power you appliances or you can scale it up to power everything.\nThe best pat is you can easily remove and take your 3D Solar Panel System with you to your forever home.

I was all in after that.\nIf you plan on using your 3D Solar Panel System as your main power supply, you do have to hire an electrician to properly hook everything up.\nUnless you have some experience with electricity, I would just go ahead and hire an electrician to be on the safe side and make sure all the wires are hooked up properly.\nThank you for stopping by and asking such great questions about the 3D Solar Panel System. I almost forgot to mention that it comes with step-by-step video tutorials.\nYou actually get to see each step of the building process on video making it so much easier than reading a book and trying to figure out blueprints.\nThanks again for visiting and I wish you the best of luck with your 3D Solar Panel project.
