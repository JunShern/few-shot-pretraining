    "text": "The StartUpLAB connects and facilitates organizations and experts to help develop ideas into viable businesses.\nYou need to be a member of StartUpLAB to add comments!\nJanuary 11th we are organizing a very special edition of Open StartUpLAB on developing future scenarios for Embassies.\nOur special guest and challenger will be the Dutch Ambassador to Finland Henk Swarttouw. The Ambassador will take part in the session at our Amsterdam location.\nThe Open StartupLAB event will simultaneously be held in multiple locations & time zones.\nLet me know if you would like to add a location or join via an online channel.\nLast weeks FREE open innovation session explored the opportunity for new business models in the International Art Market. Funding for art is being cut as part of the post-economic-crisis period of recovery. Collectors are generally spending less too. This is placing artists and art organisations under pressure and pitching them into fierce competition for survival. But is it possible to create innovative ways to fund projects? Is it possible to find new revenue streams not previously tapped into? In the increasingly competitive landscape can providing art as a 'Service' be more effective in delivering increased value that will convince more people to consume and buy art?\n1. Shared regional experiences with the other countries to understand what was happening in the market. It became clear that there are differences between the 3 participating locations. In Europe art is seen as a luxury for now, and funding cuts are being made that just leave 'core' organisations and projects; yet in Brazil the economy is growing, art is seen as an investment, and regional government sees art and culture as a cornerstone of economic growth, resulting in the art sector growing regionally, nationally and internationally.\n2. Using the Service Innovation Canvas methodology we looked at the example of Moseley Art Trail in Birmingham as a project that has been run for three years. Although successful, the organisers ambition is to grow it in 2013 and that means more funding to support full-time project management; improved marketing; and more artist commissioning. After an explanation about how the project has worked in the past the combined groups quickly offered Service Design Thinking experience to suggest ways of improving. The first key point was understanding that for the event there are multiple stakeholders including artists of different types; space providers of different types; the wider festival organisation; and last but not least, many different types of customer... So it was discovered using Value Network Mapping that there are many different exchanges of value within these groups, and that developing a complete Value Network Map will be the first step to examine the current Art Trail business model and break it into different, yet interconnected value streams, each of which may have different revenue models attached to them, but which collectively deliver a bigger and enhanced 'service' of greater value to participants. It was also suggested that using some of the different stakeholders to co-create next years event would improve the overall 'service'; improve word-of-mouth marketing; and share the project workload. This also highlighted a need to move overall project management to a new level of co-ordination, with perhaps a need to release some specialised tasks such as curation, marketing, etc.\nThe result proved to be a success in both using the Service Design Canvas and Service Design Thinking tools, and the Art trail team will now be taking this further in their planning process with support from DesignThinkers UK.\nAfter the event, it was discovered that a group of 18 artists and festival organisers from Birmingham will be visiting Belo Horizonte in 2 weeks time, with exploration of new business models part of the agenda for their trip, so at the next Start_Up_Lab on 27 April we hope to continue this conversation... Isn't it amazing what networked open innovation can do!\nFriday March 30th we will organize another Open StartUpLAB. The theme of this open lab will be Art & New Business Models.\nOne of the physical locations is at the DT Network hang-out, Amsterdam Herengracht 265.\nContributing could mean anything :-) It's an Open Lab. You can ask a question, give us a task, help us develop the Open LAB or just join the conversation.\nI'll do my best to not miss it on-line this time.\nWhat do you mean by contributing? You can send me an email too.\nThis Friday we will organize another Open StartUpLAB. It's still in Beta so let me know if you would like to contribute!\nAnd let me know if you would like to join us IRL at our creative space in Amsterdam or online.\nA great first Open Lab session today. Thank you very much for hosting us online as if we've been there! Here some impressions from an online participants' perspective."
