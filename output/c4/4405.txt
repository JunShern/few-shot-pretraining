    "text": "Did the York 10k yesterday. Great city, stunning buildings. Great crowds, great route.\nWhy? Because it is a good 12 minutes or so off my previous York 10k time.\nIt was my fastest 10k time.\nIt was the first time I have run a 10k in under and hour.\nYou could say, I smashed it.\nSo what's changed? Well, I have lost some weight. I have got advice from Rory Coleman (http://rorycoleman.blogspot.co.uk), and I have (finally) got a desire to succeed.\nYou see, I'm overweight, by some margin. I've never been sporty. I'm often deskbound. I like chocolate. I love biscuits.\nI have failed to lose weight. I have failed to stick to weight loss programmes, or fitness regimes.\nI have failed to act upon thoughts where I have recognised that I am fat and unfit.\nI am determined to work hard at getting fitter, and healthier. I don't want to be fat, unfit, old and grey. Admittedly, I'm going grey but I guess that's nature. Think George Clooney, except with bottle bottom glasses and a paunch.\nAnd I'm getting older. But that, frankly, is a good thing; I'd rather be getting older than not.\nSo. I know I can't do this by myself. I need help.\nWho's best to get advice from? When I was a reporter at the Derby Telegraph, I interviewed Rory Coleman.\nI can't remember exactly whereabouts he was on his marathon journey, but I know he's about to complete his 1,000th race. And he's done 14 Marathon de Sables. Actually, I think the reason for my interviewing him was because he was about to take part in one of his first MdS.\nMy interview with Rory was quite a few years ago. But when I realised I needed help, and was wondering to whom I should turn, Rory came to mind.\nHis words during that interview had always stayed with me. I had just failed to act upon them.\nHe spoke about dedication. Commitment. Focus. Desire. And much more.\nI knew I had it in me to change. I have got through a few things as a nipper, and, more recently, completed the London Marathon. That takes dedication and focus.\nBut when I crossed that line in London, I was so happy. I had done it. But... what would happen if I lost weight, got fitter and aimed to go quicker? What if, I thought like an athlete, and not like a tubby, greying 40+ year old?\nCan I do that? And if I can, surely everyone can?\nI'll be blogging about my fitness journey, complete with Rory's help. My next post will be about thinking like an athlete, with input from Rory and a couple of people you may have heard of."
