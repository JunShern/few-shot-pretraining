Deposit $75 and get a solid 100% match bonus to extend your play or deposit $150 and get 125% match bonus on all available card games using the bonus code SPRINGCARDS.\nAs one of the newest online casinos on the market, BoVegas is a force to be reckoned with in terms of game selection, quality, bonus offers and customer service. It seems that the folks at BoVegas have gone to extra lengths to ensure that their online casino is top notch when it comes to all the basics as well as the extras that today\u2019s players know, expect and like without going over the top.\nThe interface is fairly simple and direct, a view of the Vegas strip at night with searchlights in the background rendered in black, silver and a pleasant maroon. You won\u2019t find a lot of bells and whistles on the home page, just an easy to navigate interface that puts forward a simple three step process: join now for quick and easy registration, deposit and claim your bonus and start playing. Live Chat and help telephone numbers are prominently displayed at the top of the home page. Games with jackpot amounts and latest winners are located on the games page presented in a simple, direct fashion that is at once both sleek and uncluttered.\nThe game selection at BoVegas Casino is simply spectacular. With over 200 games powered by the masters at Real Time Gaming, you\u2019ll find an excellent assortment of state-of-the-art 3-reel, 5-reel, 3D slots with both fixed and progressive jackpots on offer, wilds, scatter symbols and extended bonus features doling out prize multipliers and free spins. BoVegas also offers one of the best selections of video poker games you can find online, with 18 video poker games in all, including classics like Jacks or Better, Deuces Wild, Joker Poker and Aces and Eights. The card games selection is also top notch with traditional favorites like Blackjack, Vegas Three Card Rummy and Pai Gow Poker alongside old school stalwarts like Baccarat and Pontoon.\nSpecialty games at BoVegas Casino include European and American Roulette, Craps, Keno and simple yet entertaining scratch games like Treasure Tree.\nAs yet another unique feature and one we haven\u2019t seen elsewhere very often, BoVegas even has a special \u201cProgressives\u201d category, listing six games, three video poker games and three slots, with progressive jackpots ranging from the hundreds of thousands of dollars into the millions, even displaying the exact real money progressive jackpot amount up for grabs, a feature we found quite compelling.\nAlso, when it comes to playing online casino games, it\u2019s always good to keep in mind that these days online casino gambling is not limited to your desktop PC or mobile! BoVegas casino offers a fully mobile optimized version of the full casino, which allows you to play all of the online casino games for real money, including blackjack, slots, video poker, craps, roulette and more on your mobile device or tablet while on the go. Thanks to the wonders of today\u2019s mobile technology, you\u2019ll never have to be bored again while waiting in line or for the doctor, at the bus, tram or metro stop, at the airport or waiting to pick up the kids. BoVegas Casino\u2019s mobile application allows you to enjoy all of the excitement of the casino\u2019s full selection of games right in the palm of your hand, no matter where you are, at any time of day or night.\nWhen it comes to online casino slots there are a few tips and tricks that are always important to keep in mind to get the most out of your online casino experience. For example, when it comes to slots and video poker, the experts will tell you always bet max. The reason is quite simple, betting max coins ensures that you will trigger all of the bonus features in the event of a win. There\u2019s nothing worse in real money online slots play than hitting it big on a slot only to learn that the mega bonus features, including prize multipliers and free spins, are amiss simply because you didn\u2019t bet max coins.\nThe second key to successful online slots play involves always, and we mean always, taking advantage of online casino bonus offers. The main difference between online casinos and their land-based counterparts is that, thanks in large part to low overhead and extensive competition on the market, online casinos like BoVegas have a vested interest in not only attracting new players with compelling welcome bonuses but keeping them coming back for more with ever-evolving bonus offers. To get the most out of your online casino experience, enhance your bankroll and extend your playtime, we can\u2019t recommend highly enough making sure you make the fullest use of all the best online casino bonuses available at BoVegas casino.\nBlackjack is the world\u2019s most popular card game and playing online blackjack at BoVegas Casino is a wonderful way to enjoy your leisure time and possibly pick up a good wad of cash in the process. Blackjack so excels in popularity around the world in part because it\u2019s a game that involves both chance and skill. The best blackjack players know that betting right can significantly decrease the built-in house edge to such a degree that, if played wisely, the casino only has around a 2% advantage, meaning that, unlike a number of other standard casino games, blackjack keeps you in the driver\u2019s seat.\nWith a wealth of different 21 games to choose from, BoVegas Casino has something for everyone including 21 Blackjack, Pontoon, Match Play 21, European Blackjack, and Perfect Pairs just to name a few of the online possibilities at BoVegas Casino. While the rules vary slightly by game, all blackjack type games involve the same principle, getting as near as possible to 21 without going over while having a higher hand than the dealer. Blackjack tables in which the dealer must hit on a soft 17 also increase your odds of winning and are always a good bet.\nVideo poker got its start in the 1970s, gaining popularity quickly to become one of the casino world\u2019s most timeless favorites. It\u2019s the perfect online casino game for slots fans and poker lovers alike, combining the best of both worlds. The visuals are fun and engaging, and it shares some of the basic rules of classic poker.\nInspired by five-card draw, video poker offers a low-stakes environment to play without worrying about opponents. Video poker makes it exceptionally easy to win \u2013 all you need to do is end up with a hand that ranks. Even if it\u2019s not the highest hand, you don\u2019t have any competitors to worry about. In many variants, you\u2019ll receive a payout just for having a pair of Jacks in your final hand. Video poker strikes a good balance between the elements of chance and skill. With optimal strategy, the house edge in video poker dips down to less than 0.5% and in some variants to almost 0%. Be sure to study the paytables for all of the relevant information. Each variant has its own special features, so you want to be sure you know the game you\u2019re playing. The paytable offers all of the winning hands and ranks them from highest to lowest. Maximum bets are always the most lucrative, with the payout ratio from four to five-coin bets increasing significantly.\nBoVegas offers one of the better selections of video poker games that we\u2019ve seen on the web so far, with 17 different types of video poker available, including old time favorites like Jacks or Better, Sevens Wild, Deuces Wild, and All American Poker to newer variants of the traditional video poker theme such as European Slot Poker and Mystery Bonus Poker.\nVisit the iconic roulette wheel at BoVegas Casino, where you can browse through the Specialty Games category to find classics like American roulette and European roulette as well as the lesser known French roulette and Multiplayer roulette variants.\nWith each version, note that rules will vary slightly, which means the house edge also varies. However, all of them feature a wide variety of possible bets. Unlike many other casino games, you can place multiple bets at a time, which is what makes the game so exciting. Bet on odds or evens, red or black, or even a risky but lucrative straight bet on a single number, which pays out 35:1.\nIf you\u2019re looking for something a bit unusual, BoVegas actually offers multiplayer roulette. This version of the game allows you to place bets alongside other players, just as you would at a land-based casino. It allows you to pick an avatar and choose a roulette table. You can watch other people play and even chat while the game is happening. When you\u2019re ready to win, you can sit in on the game and place your bets. It adds an element of competition as you try your traditional strategies or explore new ones, perhaps drawing inspiration from your opponents\u2019 tactics. Try out multiplayer roulette to experience the thrill of winning against other players.\nWith a house edge as low as 1.06%, baccarat is an online casino game for players who appreciate simplicity and solid odds. The learning curve for Baccarat is virtually nonexistent, and that\u2019s part of the game\u2019s universal charm.\nThe objective is to make an accurate prediction about whose hand will be better: the player (you) or the banker (the dealer). The better hand is the one that is closer to nine points without exceeding it. After the bet has been chosen as well as the amount of the wager, a two-card hand is dealt to the player, and the same to the banker. If you\u2019ve got a hunch that both hands will be the same, try out the risky but lucrative bet that the two hands will tie. The tie bet offers a solid 8:1 payout, but the house edge is just over 14%. Because of the low house edge when you choose the banker, it\u2019s one of the most advantageous bets that you can make at any casino, whether virtual or physical.\nTry out Baccarat in the Table Games category at BoVegas Casino. You won\u2019t be disappointed. You\u2019ll pick the game up in no time at all and witness its simple yet elegant appeal for yourself.\nMost online casino players have one key concern that takes priority over other factors of online gaming: security. Players want to know that when they are entering personal information, making real money deposits, and playing games of chance, the odds are entirely fair, and the transactions are 100% secure.\nAs an online casino, BoVegas is subject to strict rules and regulations that govern all businesses. You can rest assured that personal information and financial details are kept safe and confidential and will never be shared with third parties.

Secure Payment Voucher with a minimum deposit of $25 and a maximum of $500 is also possible. Bitcoin is the most flexible option \u2013 contact the Live Chat customer support agents for more information on how to use Bitcoin.\nEach player goes through a verification process after making the first deposit, and after that step, using any of the possible methods will result in instantaneous credit to your account, allowing you to play as soon as the urge strikes.\nAll monetary transactions performed on the BoVegas website are kept completely secure, and the process of making a withdrawal is just as quick and seamless as it is with deposits. Credit cards like Visa and MasterCard can be used to make a withdrawal of $100 minimum to $2000 maximum. Bank Wire withdrawals can be performed within the same amount. Note that the Bank Wire option requires additional information \u2013 without the SWIFT code for your bank, bank wires cannot be completed.\nTo ensure timely processing, withdrawals by each method are permitted once per week, and all payments are processed within three to seven business days.

Joel started playing Basketbull after trying a couple of other games but abandoning them after just a few spins. Once he tried Basketbull, however, Joel seemed to hit his lucky streak.
