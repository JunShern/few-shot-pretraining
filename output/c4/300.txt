Printing prayers on condoms satisfies nobody.\nIn all countries, in all centuries, the primary reason for government to set up schools is to undermine the politically weak by convincing their children that the leaders are good and their policies are wise. The core is religious intolerance. The sides simply change between the Atheists, Catholics, Protestants, Unitarians, etc., depending whether you are talking about the Soviet Union, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, America, etc. A common second reason is to prepare the boys to go to war and the girls to cheer them on.\nThe Left/Right scale is a misleading way of comparing political systems. It doesn't measure anything.\nCharter schools are just public schools on a slightly longer leash. A dog on a long leash is still a dog on a leash."
