    "text": "Showing results for tags 'cephalotus'.\nShould I cut this flower stalk?\nI have a few seed grown location Cephalotus, including a number from GRR. This one in particular is different to the others from the same location in that it has a wide middle rib.\nSo I'm itching to get my hands on a Dudley Watts cephalotus (it seems to be the largest growing cultivar from what I've read?), however as a penniless student I don't want to be stupid with my money. I've seen cephalotus cultivars go for wild prices on eBay so it's clear it can all go a bit nuts, but I'd like to know what a 'reasonable' price for a small plant of Dudley Watts is worth? I get that it's whatever the buyer thinks the plant is worth, but there must be a sensible amount of money that most would be prepared to spend?\nHi all, I thought I would share some progress pictures with you of my terrarium I'm making. This will be a very drawn out project as I'm in no rush to get it done. Basically I divided a Ceph, had an old terrarium hanging around and then a friend gave me a load of perlite so I decided to do this: I'm waiting on a load of dried sphagnum moss to arrive to create a layer over the awful garish perlite. I'm looking forward to when the moss takes over and starts growing but even dead sphag looks better than garish white perlite everywhere! I'm planning on adding some Utrics and some Drosera at some point in the year. I will be looking at lighting options too as the lighting isn't adequate at the moment either. So if anyone has any tips there (I'll be doing it on the cheap) feel free to chime in, if not I'll be cruising the forum at some point looking at some of the million lighting topics for ideas. So yeah to sum up it looks horrible at the moment but won't when I'm finished!\nA couple of pictures of one of my Cephalotus plants. It seems to have gone crazy, throwing out pitchers on top of pitchers. I have actually removed a few and it's still going wild! Regards, Ian.\nCephs putting on some colour this year.\nHi all, My seed grown Cephalotus are now in their second winter and are colouring up nicely in their temporary terrarium. The plants in the terrarium, Plant 1 in natural light, and plant 2 in natural light, The colours in the picture of plant 2 look a bit washed out, may have been the angle I took it at, it is actually darker than plant 1 in reality. Hope you like them. Best regards, Ian.\nThis is my baby ceph, I recently noticed this new trap appearing a little way off from the main plant, what is it? a new plant developing on the same root system? in any case I's also like to ask if it looks like it might be time to pop it in a bigger pot? it's stating to look mighty crowded at the edge of that little 5cm pot. if it does need re-potting, what medium would be best? obviously to minimise root disturbance it'll be a case of just slitting open the pot carefully and placing the whole soil& plant clump into it's new home together. Thanks for any answers in advance!"
