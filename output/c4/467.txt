I think the integrity is a big piece to it,\" O&apos;Donnell said.\nNevada&apos;s effective monopoly on sports betting ended last spring, when the Supreme Court ruled the ban should be lifted. Casinos in seven other states \u2014 Rhode Island, Delaware, Mississippi, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and New Mexico \u2014 now accept wagers on sports. The list is expected to grow by next year with numerous states considering bills.\nAnd there&apos;s already a hitch that could slow bets: NASCAR this season has decided for the first time to strip drivers of victories if their cars are deemed illegal. There will be a roughly 90-minute inspection after the race and the winner will not be deemed official until the process is completed. Will fans really want to linger around the pay window another couple of hours just to cash in a ticket?\n\"The state&apos;s risk manager will delay any payout until NASCAR releases the official order of finish,\" Kirk said. \"Our casinos will receive an email reminding them of NASCAR&apos;s new procedures the week of Daytona.\"\nThe betting lines supplied by William Hill are set: Kevin Harvick and Kyle Busch are 5-1 favorites to win the 2019 Cup series championship. 2018 champ Joey Logano checks in at 7-1. For Sunday&apos;s Daytona 500, Harvick has 15-2 odds, Logano is at 8-1 and Brad Keselowski is also at 8-1 to win \"The Great American Race.\"\n\"The rules are in place,\" Hensley said, \"but you can&apos;t legislate human behavior.\""
