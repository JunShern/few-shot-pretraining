Average UPS Ground shipping times, according to UPS, are listed below. Please note that it is possible for things to take longer in the event of weather or other random acts of nature.

Around major holidays, things may take a little bit longer i.e. up to 5 business days for your order to leave our fulfillment center. You will receive an email with tracking information as soon as your order is picked up by shipping carrier. Please note that it in some cases, it can take up to 24 hours for the tracking number to show tracking information.\nWe ship to all 50 states and most countries, with a few exceptions. We can ship anything to military bases + APOs abroad.\nWHAT IF MY PACKAGE IS RETURNED?\nEvery once in a while a package is damaged in transit and is unable to be delivered. In event of this rare occurence, the package will be returned to us. Once it arrives back at our facilities, it can take several days for our warehouse team to process the return and for us to reach out. If you know of a damaged package before we do, please contact us at store@batchusa.com and let us know!\nIf you receive damaged item, whether it be crumbled cookies or a broken bottle, please reach out to us at store@batchusa.com and we\u2019ll do whatever we can to make things right. If you\u2019re able to, we always appreciate receiving photographs so we can take it up with UPS or our shipping team, if need be. While rare, occasionally a product we carry might not be your cup of tea or taste of chocolate. Unfortunately, we cannot accept returns based on not liking the taste, texture or flavor. You should never receive a product that is expired, but if something tastes off please let us know.\nCAN I ORDER GIFTS FOR MY COMPANY OR EVENT?\nYes.
