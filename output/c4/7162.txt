But for now just a handful of photos to mark the event. The next day a smaller group of us went for a walk organised by Louise.\nFor many years now I have been representing the Old Boys at the annual race against the current pupils. Here is the team before the race and then me finishing it. This year Lou and I combined it with a picnic and tour of the grounds for Alison and Martin Trowell. The Old Boys won this year which was a nice ending to my racing career because I have decided that this is my last year."
