    "text": "How does a web server work?\nCheck Hosting Marketers it is a hosting company which offers, all that can be expected from a high quality hosting company, but with the cheapest prices on the net.\nWhen you are going to order cheap web hosting, it will be a good idea to know more about how does a web server work.\nNowadays, the data exchange between web browser and the web server has grown more complicated than before. The main reason for this is the need for dynamic Web content that is used by firms and individual customers to manage online business operations. So, we decided to create this article for your understanding how a web server works. You can use it to be more acquainted with this when you will look for your cheap web hosting.\nIn a general way, Web servers operate with simple, static content: HTML documents and images. Web server pick up the users request for files and takes it to the host file system. The needed file is loaded from the disk and in the end is delivered to the Web browser by the Web server.\nThe web browser and the Web server communicate with each other using HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol). A single TCP connections are opened that dispatch first the HTML document and then images, one-by-one, correspondingly.\nDynamic content is the powerful tool for e-commerce and the important reason for the whopping growth of the World Wide Web. It wants large databases or other program software. The Web server delivers a dynamic content of Web page to the web browser that is made in response to the user direct or indirect input. This process generally takes up many server-side resources and requires CGI usage.\nCGI is in the main a web server extension protocol and widely used standard for delivering dynamic content. It may be noted that CGI is not language specific; it\u2019s a protocol that allows Web server to communicate with a program. CGI defines how the Web server has to run programs locally and transmit their output to the Web browser. For example, a Web server starts CGI program to send the parameters as requested by the users browser. It then retrieves output from the webstore.cgi program to pass output back to the browser. This is how CGI programs dynamically serve HTML data based on user input. CGI\u2019s adverse conditions consists in its slow processing since each request for dynamic content builds on a new program to be started. CGI scripts can be written in many languages: Perl, C/C++, Python, TCL e.c.\nHTTPS is a security protocol that allows a safety Web connection. This means that with HTTPS it is safe for an exchange of sensitive data between user and the server across the insecure network. URLs that begin with \u2018https\u2019 are handled using SSL algorithms that setup a secure, encrypted link between a Web browser and a Web server.\nMIME type is the fundamental mechanism to show content downloaded by the browser. It tells browser about the content type being delivered. MIME types are identified using a type/subtype syntax associated with a file extension.\nIn out time web servers are able to process and deliver multiple requests in a simultaneous way to deal with a lot of users at a time. This parallelism is accomplished in two different ways \u2013 multi threading and multi processing. The most web sites run web servers that support either multi threading or multi processing and can manipulate a much higher load. So, I think this will be helpful when you search for your cheap web hosting company.\nright domain name for your online business?\nby now why having your own domain is so important.\nNECCESSITY if you\u2019re serious about doing business online!\nBut aren\u2019t all the good domain names gone you say?\ndoes not exclude your online business!\nNow what\u2019s branding in simple terms?\nonline is by your domain name!\nif it\u2019s still available for registration?\nwhich is essentially a bidding on top keywords.\nhad expired or will be expiring!\nthrough them (no hidden charges).\nto be reliable and provide quality services.\nWhy spend more when you can save more?!\nCan you STILL Win the domain name game?\nI was recently asked by a visitor to thesitewizard.com to take a look at her company\u2019s website, designed by a university student. I will not give the URL for that site, partly to protect the innocent, and partly because by the time you read this, it\u2019ll probably have been modified.\nIn general, that site is typical of the kind of sites produced by newcomers to web design. It scores well in terms of prettiness and gadgetry (although only under one browser, it doesn\u2019t work well under other browsers), but fares dismally in terms of usability and search engine readiness. In fact, the reason my visitor wrote to me was because the website suffered a significant drop in the number of visitors after it was redesigned in its current form.\nThis article uses that site as a starting point for discussing some of the issues that a web designer needs to consider when creating a website that must exist and compete in the real world (as opposed to a site that is created merely to fulfill the course requirements of a school or university).\nOver the years that I have dealt with newcomers to web design, it is my observation that they tend to focus excessively (and sometimes almost exclusively) on the appearance of a website. The site I mentioned earlier is a case in point: the designer tried hard to make the site look beautiful (and, if I may add, succeeded too \u2013 the site does indeed look pretty). However, as hard as it may be to believe (if you are a newcomer), appearance isn\u2019t the most important thing to look at when you are planning and creating your site.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong here. I\u2019m not saying that appearance is of no importance. Far from it. However, in this article, my intention is to address the excessive importance newcomers place on beauty. In fact, if you belong to the other extreme, discounting the value of the appearance of a website altogether.\nHaving said that, your site can still survive (or even thrive) if it is a plain-looking site like Google. This is not necessarily the case if you overlook the other important issues in web design.\nAll sites are created for a particular purpose. Some were created so that their owners can sell something. Others are information resources (like thesitewizard.com). Still others are designed to showcase their owner\u2019s talents (such as sites displaying the owner\u2019s resumes and portfolios).\nIs the information that your visitors need to make informed decisions available on your site? For example, before they can buy a product, they will want to know more about that product. A brief one-line summary about your product\u2019s features may work for your main page, but you will probably find that you get more buyers if you can provide a link to a page that gives a detailed list of features of each of your products.\nA good navigational system for your website is crucial. A navigational system is one by which visitors can move from one page to another. For example, on thesitewizard.com, one way in you can access the main pages on the site is to use the navigation buttons on the left column of the page.\nIf you are using a navigation bar or panel, standardize its location on all the pages of your website. Don\u2019t make your visitors feel as though they are embarking on a treasure hunt every time they reach a new page.\nIn addition to your navigation bar or panel, provide short-cuts to places where visitors are likely to want to go. Don\u2019t force your visitors to have to go through your main page (or your site map) every time they need to visit another page on your site. In fact, put direct links in logical places \u2013 for example, on your \u201cProducts\u201d page, you should have a links to your \u201cBuy / Order\u201d page as well as links to the pages with detailed information about individual products. Think like a visitor and ask yourself what are the things a visitor might want to know or do when he/she is at a particular page.\nIf your site has a large number of pages, a site search engine will improve your site\u2019s usability. Not everyone mentally organises information the way you do. Hence a logical arrangement to you may not be logical to another person. Giving your visitors a way to search your web site will help them locate what they want.\nThis is a problem fairly easily fixed (for example, one way is to create a site map and add a normal link to it from the main page), but it illustrates one of the most important issues a real-world website faces: search engine visibility. If your site is not listed in the search engines, you\u2019re not going to be able to get many visitors, if at all. Without visitors, you\u2019re obviously not going to be able to achieve your purpose for the site.\nDesigning a site that is search engine ready is a lengthy topic, so I am not even going to try to address it here.\nBenefits of a web site.\nWhen you\u2019re searching through the Internet you will find endless amounts of information, about everything, and all at your fingertips. The Internet is the largest source of knowledge in the world. Why is this? Because anyone can get their information on there. All you need is a web site and a resource generous web hosting company.\nMany people think that getting their website on the Internet is an expensive venture, fortunately though, this need not necessarily be true; if you find the right web host, the benefits of having a web site will definitely outweigh the costs.\nThere are many different ways to benefit from having a web site, whether it is for personal gain, or to aid your business success. Those who have their own personal websites generally use them to further an interest or a hobby; having a web site is a great way to share and exchange knowledge with others. Businesses on the other hand use a website to promote and market their goods and services, while cutting back on such expenses as postage, couriers and advertising, etc.\nIncreased awareness of products and services \u2013 Businesses can now greatly expand their markets, no need to constrain the focus to only the local scene, but by using the Internet, businesses can venture into international and regional markets, with greater ease. This dynamically changes the nature and the marketing activities of some businesses, possibly encouraging the business to expand the diversity of its products and services, to meet these new markets. Websites, in their nature, allow hundreds and thousands of items to be on view 24/7; thus encouraging wider viewing, and extended trading hours.\nFreedom \u2013 With the freedom of being able to post your information on your website, hence on the Internet, at any time of the day; available information of all variations is increasing at a huge rate. The freedom to browse anywhere and interact with anyone is enough to tempt the smallest of businesses and the most introverted of people to get on the Net; hence Net users are increasing in numbers, at an alarming rate, approximately 50,000 per day. Businesses are buzzing on the Net, they have found a way to compete on an even field, with even the largest of corporations; and within a daily increasing customer marketplace.\nCost advantage \u2013 Net businesses are extremely aware of how they can profit by being on the Internet; they can advertise their products and services without the huge costs, and delays of printing, publishing and distribution. The market is a global one, which adds greater value to the costs outlaid for promotion and marketing; compared to the limits of offline. Ecommerce facilities can be incorporated into the website, transforming 2D screen visuals into user reactive models, for example, consumers can order their products and services online, greatly reducing administration expenses. Reduction of telephone calls to potential customers; follow ups by email; newsletters digitally made, promoted by email or downloadable from the website, with reduction of distribution costs; less promotional material sent out, printed and wasted; extended trading hours without a human presence; are just a few ways to cut costs.\nThe current opinion is that any business not on the Internet now or in the near future is not only missing out on the rewards of this new and vibrant industry, but is adding itself to the list of \u201cthe forgotten\u201d.\nDon\u2019t waste time scratching your head wondering what the Internet can do to benefit your business, you will be left behind; instead, think about how you can take advantage of this new and cheap form of industry awareness. Look for a web designer, or web developer, get a quote, and tell them what you need.\nFree hosting \u2013 is it charity?\n\u201cFree hosting\u201d is most of the time offered in exchange for placing advertising on your website, meaning that the host will automatically place an advertisement at the top and sometimes at the bottom of every page of your website. Sometimes they don\u2019t use banners they use pop-ups.\nNo matter what they ask you to do in exchange for free hosting, you have to do something in exchange, so you\u2019re not being offered free hosting! It\u2019s just a barter. They give you hosting in exchange for placing ads on your website. They call it free because you don\u2019t give them any money, but you do pay for it.\nThey claim and even convince you that they\u2019re doing you a favor: they give you free hosting. They know that if you think the service is free you\u2019ll not complain for downtime, unresponsive support teams. But you\u2019re not getting it for free!\nNow, even if they would offer it for free, the service should be at least acceptable. But it usually isn\u2019t. If one offers free lunch for the poor, that food must not be rotten. It\u2019s just common sense!\nWhat these free hosting services always seem to forget to mention is the fact that they\u2019re not charities. They\u2019re businesses and they\u2019re always looking for ways to make a profit.\nI find it deceiving that they use the word \u201cfree\u201d when the right name for it should be \u201cbarter hosting\u201d or \u201ctrade hosting\u201d or \u201cad-funded hosting\u201d. But, as strange as it might sound, the world doesn\u2019t revolve around me , so the so called free hosting will remain \u201cfree hosting\u201d. Too many people in the hosting industry use this term and too many regular people look for \u201cfree hosting\u201d for it to go away.\nIt should not be a surprise that free hosting is not as good as paid hosting. The problems that are common in the paid hosting section of the hosting industry are almost a rule in the world of free hosting. Timely support is almost out of the question with most free hosts. Excessive downtime and slow servers are almost the norm rather than just common problems.\nThat isn\u2019t to say that free web hosting can\u2019t be acceptable in terms of quality. There are some companies that offer reliable free web hosting. Don\u2019t get me wrong, reliable here doesn\u2019t mean paid-hosting-reliable, it means reliable according to the free hosting standards (whatever that means) .\nThey figure (bet) that you\u2019ll go for their paid version (most free hosts have paid plans too), as soon as your website will outgrow it\u2019s account in terms of bandwidth and/or space. Sure, you\u2019re getting a free start, but the host gives you well below $1/month worth of resources, so they\u2019re not giving you much.\nWhat\u2019s in it for the host in this case? Well, the host gets brand awareness because it gets to be published in the myriad of free hosting directories. Also it gets it\u2019s name in your URL and in the URL of lots of other websites. Branding again! Also, if the service is at least acceptable it will get a good reputation, which often is worth more than pure gold. All those ultimately mean more business for their business .\nIt happened and it still does, that some hosts start their business with a great \u201cfree hosting\u201d offer. Their name soon gets published all over the Internet. After a while (usually a year or more) the company stops offering free hosting. Some of their \u201cfree\u201d clients will agree to become paying customers, while others will decide to see their work vanish into oblivion, but not pay. By that time though, the host gains immense brand awareness. It might also get quite a few clients as soon as they turn into a paid host because of those clients that were hosted for free and decide to pay to keep their websites up and running.\nUnlimited space/hosting are a no-no in the paid hosting arena. In the free hosting arena it\u2019s even worse. It basically spells out that the servers will be overcrowded. Although you might like the idea of having as much space and data transfer as you need, please resist the temptation. Unlimited space/bandwidth is an illusion. It\u2019s like when you\u2019re seeing water in the middle of the desert. A mirage. You are promised, but you will not receive.\nActually it\u2019s not that secret, just not widely known. As I said in the beginning of this article, free hosting is most of the time nothing more than a barter.\nNow here\u2019s the idea: why settle for lousy \u201cfree hosting\u201d when you can barter for quality hosting instead? All you need to do is find a few good paid hosting companies and then ask for hosting in exchange for placing ads on your website.\nYour greatest advantage is that you\u2019ll be able to make those ads fit your website perfectly. They will not be automatically added to your pages at the top or bottom. You\u2019ll have complete control over your website\u2019s design.\nSure, you\u2019ll have to negotiate where to place those ads. It\u2019s normal for the host to ask for the ads to be placed so that they\u2019ll get high chances to be noticed by your website\u2019s visitors. As long as they don\u2019t ask for a big banner to be placed on your pages I don\u2019t see a serious problem. I would suggest you though to go for a text ad. It\u2019s usually much easier to make a text ad blend-in nicely so that it doesn\u2019t scream \u201cI\u2019m an ad!\u201d.\nSo your website\u2019s audience should have a rather high interest in buying hosting. Web programmers, web designers, webmasters, search engine optimization specialists and web business owners are among those who might be interested in hosting offers. If your website attracts such people, you have significantly better chances to trade ads in exchange for hosting.\nOne thing to notice is that your chances to barter for hosting are considerably smaller if you\u2019re just launching your website. That\u2019s because you can\u2019t get something for nothing. If you offer advertising and have no audience you\u2019re basically offering potential audience and ask for hosting in exchange. The only chance you\u2019ve got is to convince the host that your site has great potential. That you have a good plan to get visitors.\nYou might think that if it\u2019s just starting your website will not consume lots of resources. After all, the activity is near zero. However there is more to hosting than just that. You will need some support, which costs the host quite a lot.\nFree hosting is not free \u2013 at least in the form in which it exists on the internet today. I have yet to find a free host that is a real charity. As strange as it might sound, look out for free hosts that seem to be completely free (charity-like). A host must have funding! Ask them how do they cover or plan to cover their costs. Is there a foundation behind that host? It\u2019s highly unlikely, but who knows!\nAll hosts have to pay for the servers, bandwidth and staff. If they don\u2019t have a good plan to cover the costs, the future for them is grim and services will soon degrade due to under funding.\nThe best option if you don\u2019t want to spend money for hosting is to barter for it with a respected, serious, honest web host. But don\u2019t ever trick yourself into thinking that you\u2019re getting something for nothing. Ads are a form of payment so you\u2019re payin\u2019."
