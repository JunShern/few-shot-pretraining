I still have work to do!\"\nOkay, I've read some of your command and bugs problem, so I've made this guide to summary up for temporary solution for now. I've might change it after a few weeks after Recorder's new update, or some new bug problem that needs to be testing. Hope this help.\n1 ) Don't uninstall a mod mid-play, especially heavily scripted ones. They mess up your save game slowly. Although there are some mod that are safe to remove, but you will still need to clean up your save after that. Use \"Save game script cleaner\", It's easy to use even for beginners: http://www.nexusmods...im/mods/52363/?\n2 ) Skyrim can only handle 255 mods. The game won't be able to load more than that, but there is a way to bypass that. You can merge multiple mod into one. They will give you a boost to performances and allow you to test out more mod without trouble! I highly recommend using one, remember to read the instruction: http://www.nexusmods...im/mods/69905/?\n7 ) Remember to clean your esp, especially the official esp. (Update.esp; Dawnguard; Hearthfire; Dragonborn). Also use LOOT to check if there are any esp. that needs cleaning. You can clean them by using TES5Edit, remember to go watch video on youtube for instruction for this one : http://www.nexusmods...im/mods/25859/?\n8 ) Resist the temptation of modding. This is the most difficult task that no man has ever succeeded it, but you must do it, otherwise you will hear your soul screaming: \"...f***...I accidentally break my game for immersion and slottiness...\"\nI'm looking at you MxR.\nWell that should be everything you need to remember about modding Skyrim. I know there's a lot of thing to digest but You'll get use to it in time.\n1 ) I can't find The lost file at *location name* ?\n2 ) \"SETSTAGE\" command for Recorder's \"LOST FILE QUEST\"? + I ACCIDENTALLY READ THE WHITERUN FILE, WHAT SHOULD I DO?\n-The \"Lost File\" quest console command is \"PPRecorderLostFilesQuest\", if you wanted to use the \"setstage\" command, use this for emergency ONLY if you somehow encounter a bug or accidentally read the file at Whiterun.\nEDIT: I saved you guys the trouble to figure out the stage command for the quest, hope this help for people who still have trouble with the quest.\n3) How do I get Omnico the Ball of Wonder?\n-If you can't get the spell tome through Recorder's Dialogue, than you can take it from her inventory, don't worry, You won't break her quest..\n3.5) OMNICO WON'T FOLLOW ME, IS THAT NORMAL?\n4) HOW ABOUT THE MISSING DRUNKEN DIALOGUE?\n5 ) I use option from *follower overhaul mod like AFT, EFF UFO, etc...* But she won't talk to me; Can't dismiss her; Can't Re-recruit her! What should I do ?\n-Don't try to control her with option from follower overhaul mod like AFT, IAFT, UFO, EFF,... Sometime it will destroy her AI, can be fixed by remove her from controlled or load from a save before you control her with them.\n6 ) RECORDER'S HEAD TURN BROWN (black)! WHAT HAPPENED?!??!?!\n8 ) (For Newbs) How do I let Recorder stay at my home whenever I dismiss her?\n-If you wanted to set Recorder to stay at your home whenever you dismissed her, only use \"My home is your home\" Mod or the \"2plus\" version for more up to date. Don't worry, it's compatible with her and most follower without a their own custom homing system. Don't use follower overhaul control to set her home cause the result won't be... pretty.\nOpen up \"Notepad\" and paste in the text.\nIn the \"Save\" dialog box, navigate to the Skyrim directory. Default directory locations are listed below.\nNon-Steam: \"C:\\Program Files\\Bethesda Softworks\\The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim\" or \"C:\\Program Files\\The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim\"\nAfter that, name and save the file. It is recommended you use a simple and appropriate name. For example, if you are using the \"All Obtainable Spells\" list below, name the file \"spells\". When saving the file, be sure that it has no file extension (i.e. rename the file and remove the \".txt\" from the end).\nStart up Skyrim. While ingame, open the console (default key: ~ or `). Type \"bat <file name>\", without quotes and using the name of your text file. Continuing the example from above, you would type in \"bat spells\" and the console will handle the rest, granting all obtainable spells to your character.\n10 ) I ask Recorder to \"wait\" but she keeps following me? What should I do?\n( PLAN A ) Use \"My home is your home\" as a place holder for the \"Relax\" option. Set her a home at a place you wanted her relax, than dismiss her for now. and you can come back to get her, buuuut you will still have to go back to the place where you wanted Recrder to stay when dismiss (unless you wanted her to stay the \"Sleeping Giant Inn\").\n11 ) *For newbs again* I don't like her body type, can I change it?\n12) I accidentally exit out the conversation when first meeting her and now her dialogue option is gone? I CAN'T TALK TO HER? WHAT SHOULD I DO?!?!? SHOULD I UNINSTALL HER AND RE-STALL HER?!?!?!?!\n13) RECORDER IS SWIMMING IN AIR?!?!? WHAT THE HORKER?!?!\n14) Recorder doesn't dismount except when I enter into a new Area (Cell) (Dungeon, Town, Inn,Home, e.t.c...). How Can I force her to dismount?\nA ) Click on Recorder > Type moveto player > Ya Done, she's now off Epony's back... seriously Panda, stop throwing Easter Egg at us.\nSee, Simple and temporary solution. Now get yourself ready to bang your head against the table for not being able to figure it out.\n15) Recorder is mounting... the ground (A.k.a. She stuck in riding animation even when she dismount her horse)... Any help?\nOkay guys, that's all of it for now, If you have a different problem, a new bug, glitch or a new way to fix the current bug plz do reply and leave a comment here.\n16) Recorder doesn't want to get her files back, I want to remove them, is it save to remove them using console command?\n-Despite being a dual wielder, Recorder's Two-handed Skills are always seem to be higher than her One-handed skill. She would even willing to use any Two-handed weapon that you will give her (You can now turn Recorder into Ruby Rose YEESSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!). Ironically, Her ring, \"Recorder Power seed\", give her a small boost to One-handed skill.\n-Recorder has no skill for the Magic like Destruction, yet at early level, her Magika Bar take a much higher priority than her health and stamina... In English, Her Magika Bar is MUCH higher than Health bar and Stamina Bar at early level.\n-Epony, Recorder's horse, is actually both a terrible pun and an Easter Egg referring to Epona, Link's horse from the Legend of Zelda. Smooth Potastic, Real smooth.\n- Added a 3 solution for the \"Wait\" Option and answer for our popular the question \"How to change Recorder's body type?\"\n- I said that it's! I'm serious, Why are you guys still reading this????!??!?!??!\nWarning Contain SPOILER for people haven't watch RVB yet.\n\"There's so many stories about some brave hero decided to give their life to save the day, and because of their sacrifice, the good guys win, the survivors all cheer, and everybody lives happily ever after.\"\nEdited by VoidWanderrer, 12 April 2017 - 03:02 PM.\nIn response to post #45017350.\nVoidWanderrer wrote: Okay, I've read some of your command and bugs problem, so I've made this guide to summary up for temporary solution for now.

Don't use follower overhaul control to set her home cause the result... won't be pretty.\n9 ) ME AND RECORDER HAVE BECOME LOVERS BUT AFTER THAT, SHE SEEM TO THINK THAT I'VE ALREADY MARRIED TO SOMEONE ELSE? WHAT THE TALOS?!!?!?!? AND HOW THE HECK DO I GET THE SPELL TOME??!!?!?!\n-And that's where the real bug began. Even though I'm not a modder but I've a lot of reason to believed that it's because that Recorder was added to the spouse faction,the game misunderstand that you've enter the marriage status and somehow cost a mislead to the dialogue tree that's only trigger when you married. I think the only way to fix this is when you become lover's with Recorder, she should be added to a stand alone faction or some alternate fix of coding form the CK, but it's just my theory, there could be another fix.\n-For now, the only alternative, to get her summon spell tome is to access to her inventory after became \"lovers\".\nIn response to post #45017350. #45138780 is also a reply to the same post.\nAnyway, this is pretty much my first Unofficial Guide, so if you guys have any more problem, plz leave a reply here instead of the comment section.\nEdited by VoidWanderrer, 30 November 2016 - 09:30 AM.\nIn response to post #45017350. #45138780, #45143780 are all replies on the same post.\n-plz note that mod that modified Whiterun, Winterhold, Eldergleam's hot spring area and Rivewood plus Open cities are incompatible with the quest and sometime they will hide the lost file by causing the filel to clip through object that was place there.\n5 ) I USE A COMMAND ON RECORDER FROM *follower overhaul mod like AFT, EFF UFO, etc...\" BUT NOW SHE WON'T TALK TO ME OR DO SOMETHING OUT OF CONTROL, HOW SHOULD I FIXED THIS?\n-Don't try to control her with option from follower overhaul mod like AFT, IAFT, UFO, EFF,....

You've MARRIED HER!!!!!! (Shocking truth yes I know).When you and Recorder became lovers, She has been added to your Spouse (AKA: WIFE!!!!!!!! ) faction without you realizing it.\n10 ) I ASK RECORDER TO \"WAIT\" BUT SHE KEEPS FOLLOWING ME?

THE SUBTITLE IS THERE BUT SHE DOESN'T HAVE A VOICE? I've downloaded her optional and her main file.\n9 ) Me and Recorder have became Lovers but after that, she seem to think that I've already married to someone else? WHAT THE TALOS?!!?!?!? And how in Oblivon do I get her spell tome??!!?!?!\n-FUNFACT: You didn't just became lovers with her...... You've MARRIED HER!!!!!!

I think the only way to fix this is when you become lover's with Recorder, she should be added to a stand alone faction or some alternate fix of coding form the CK, but it's just my theory, there could be another fix.\nUpdate : I was unsure about my answer so I did a run with only 3 DLC, Recorder and Live Another Live(to skip Helgen) . And the result doesn't change, she will still think I was married to someone else after become lovers with her. Unless Hearthfire and Live Another Live was responsible somehow, this proof my theory from above was correct. So getting her spell tome through her dialogue is IMPOSSIBLE without some serious coding.\n1. Download the loosefiles package.\n2. Clean all of your NIFs with the SSE NIF optimizer.(This is important for not getting red and white vertices around Recorder and in some cases just getting her to appear.) You can get it here: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4089/?\n3. Install the Mod. I re-zipped the files and added to NMM from file, but any organizer or a manual install to the data folder should work.\n4. Helpful but not necessary step: Clean with SSECK.\nb. Set Your Recorder ESP as the active file, then load it and the masters.\n5. Launch Skyrim, find Recorder, cause mayhem.\nSo far the only issue I'm running into is that I CTD as soon as it tries to load the memory after finding the file in her questline. If anyone has any ideas or can help with that I'd appreciate it. I also ran into some issues recruiting her while that doppelganger Ambriel was in my party. I dismissed Ambriel, recruited Recorder, and now they seem to get along fine.\nYou should also Remember, If Recorder STILL turn into... a triangle than just remove her legging. It was cause by some texture bug.\n-Added a 3 solution for the \"Wait\" Option and answer for our popular the question \"How to change Recorder's body type?\"\nalso added a \"How to port Recorder to SE\" to this guide as well, Thx too rgillchrest.\nEdited by VoidWanderrer, 04 December 2016 - 04:08 AM.\nIn response to post #45017350. #45138780, #45143780, #45203125, #45215570 are all replies on the same post.\n-If you wanted to set Recorder to stay at your home whenever you dismissed her, only use \"My home is your home\" Mod or the \"2plus\" version for more up to date.

But I don't think you need to do something like uninstall and reinstall her. It's a little bit to extreme if you have that problem. Just load from your last save if you accidentally exit her conversation.\nButanyway yeah, You should clean up your save game before using it again. Here use this, remember to follow the instruction from the description: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52363/?\nEdited by VoidWanderrer, 13 December 2016 - 10:44 AM.\nButanyway yeah, You should clean up your save game before using it again.
