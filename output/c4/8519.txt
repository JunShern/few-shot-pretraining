    "text": "I\u2019m not all the way through revisiting season 1 yet, but I just couldn\u2019t resist.\nWhy Found-Again? Like Highlander: The Series, this was much beloved by some of my roommates during the \u201990s. Because it had only been a few years since I was my college\u2019s biggest Vampire Files fan, it always bugged me at the time that I hated Forever Knight. It\u2019s a classic example of a potential Found-Again show, and only availability prevented me from doing this one earlier.\nSeriously, someone hop into the comments and help me, because I don\u2019t know how to like Nick Knight. I think I am the ideal audience for a vampire cop show; my expectations are appropriately lowered from having disliked it the first time; and I can\u2019t fault their casting, because every time I see Geraint Wyn Davies as Nick, I feel like he wandered out of a medieval movie, which should be a plus.\nInstead, it just makes me wonder why Nick has had centuries to perfect his people skills, yet is still kind of a doucherocket. I even hate his name: Nick was a Crusader, so he used to be a knight, and he\u2019s only out at night, get it? It\u2019s as if I went out, got nosferatued, and started my new unlife by calling myself J. A. Wordwhacker. Forever Wordwhacker.\nIf you want to be a vampire, it turns out there\u2019s an app for that.\nLet\u2019s also talk about how 1) Nick doesn\u2019t need a slightly dim, slightly sleazy cop sidekick, and 2) said sidekick doesn\u2019t need to have a name that\u2019s pronounced \u201cSkanky.\u201d (That Wordwhacker thing up there doesn\u2019t sound so outlandish now, does it?) It\u2019s a problem when someone saying a character\u2019s name gently lifts you out of the story and back into the seventh grade, and the legitimate last-name spelling isn\u2019t all that apparent when people are just saying \u201cSkanky\u201d on television.\nIt\u2019s spelled Schanke, but I\u2019m guessing no one ever asks.\nThe Verdict: I still don\u2019t like Forever Knight, but I do have a better handle on why. Tortured soul? Multiple lost loves? Ostensibly the hero but really kind of snippy and condescending to the mortals? Nick Knight is Connor MacLeod from Highlander, but with fangs. (In fairness, Nick is probably a jerk because he is always hungry.) When I rule the universe, this will be a show in which Lacroix mind-whammies Natalie into curing all the other vampires so he can be the top pallid banana. Until then\u2026 well, until then, I even hate the graphic design.\nMight go well with: I\u2019ve always found that the best food for making fun of vampires is a bag of Bugles; use them for fake fangs. Otherwise, I\u2019d go with Highlander: The Series and the Dark Shadows revival.\nNext time: The Quest family gets \u00fcber themselves."
