    "text": "Grab your dancing shoes and put them on daily. A new study published in The Scandinavian Journal of Medicine and Science in Sports examined the potential effects of 16 different exercise types for reducing disability for activities of daily living (ADL) in older women and found that dancing may be just the right ticket.\nThe prospective study enrolled 1,003 women without ADL disability. All participants were asked in person whether they performed any of 16 exercise types. ADL disability during eight years of follow-up was defined as dependence in at least one ADL task (walking, eating, bathing, dressing or toileting).\nAnticancer vaccines are showing promise now and some investigators report that we may be moving into a new era. Cutting edge developments in this re-energized field recently were presented at the 2018 ESMO Immuno-Oncology Congress in Geneva, Switzerland.\nThe original anticancer vaccines, launched in the late 1990s, were based on shared tumor antigens and failed to induce a potent immune response. After decades of disappointing results, a number of advances have sparked a renewed interest in the field. These include new technologies and prediction algorithms to personalize vaccines, and the introduction of checkpoint inhibitors for combination therapy.\n\u201cThere is again a flurry of activity around anticancer vaccines. We can now customize vaccines for each patient based on the genomic information in their tumor, and the early results are promising,\u201d said Dr. Michal Bassani-Sternberg, Group Leader, who is with the Department of Oncology, University of Lausanne, Switzerland.\nPersonalization has been made possible with high-throughput next generation sequencing. This technology identifies mutations that are unique to a patient\u2019s tumor and are not found elsewhere in the body, allowing a vaccine to mount a cancer-specific immune response. Algorithms can predict which neoantigens should be targeted for vaccination.\n\u201cWe have a good way to fish out and propose targets for vaccination. The first trials were published last year and showed that the selected targets were immunogenic, meaning that vaccination induced immune responses or amplified existing immune responses against these neoantigens. In addition, the vaccines worked well with checkpoint inhibitors,\u201d said Dr. Bassani-Sternberg.\nNumerous questions remain unanswered, such as when to vaccinate patients. Should this be immediately after surgery, when there are few tumor cells left, or beforehand? Despite these questions, vaccination appears feasible. The technology to develop vaccines is available and getting better, the vaccines are safe and immunogenic, and clinical trial testing is beginning. \u201cWe are counting on new technologies that have now matured. Next generation sequencing has made identification of vaccine targets more efficient, reliable and cheaper,\u201d said Dr. Bassani-Sternberg.\nBut how old are you really?\nResearchers have long observed that biological age and chronological age are not always one and the same. A 55-year-old may exhibit many signs of old age and have numerous age-related diseases, whereas an 80-year-old may be healthy and robust. While diet, physical activity and other factors play a role, there are many contributors as to why and how some people age better than others. Those contributors remain poorly understood.\ncells ranging from the very young to the very old and looked for molecular signatures that can be predictive of age. Developing a better understanding of the biological processes of aging could eventually help to address health conditions that are more common in old age, such as heart disease and dementia.\nThe researchers focused on a type of skin cell called dermal fibroblasts, which generate connective tissue and help the skin to heal after injury. The investigators analyzed fibroblasts taken from 133 healthy individuals ranging in age from 1 to 94. To get a representative sample, the team studied an average of 13 people for each decade of age. The lab cultured the cells to multiply, then used a method called RNA sequencing to look for biomarkers in the cells that change as people get older.\nIf the findings from this study are validated, doctors could use this type of analysis to determine when to begin screening each individual patient for age-related conditions and to advise them about healthy lifestyle choices. More research needs to be done before any preventive treatments could be developed. One of the next steps of this research will be look for these signatures in other types of cells."
