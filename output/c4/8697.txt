    "text": "Grant Avritt (\u201810) is just starting his career in the medical field, but the educational route he took to get there might surprise some. During his time in MCPS and beyond, he found value in studying an array of topics. Although he now specializes in anesthesiology, he certainly wasn\u2019t put to sleep by his classes in MCPS as he recalls the importance of a diverse public education experience.\nFollowing graduation, Grant attended Vanderbilt University where, despite knowing that his career aspirations were in the medical field, he majored in history with a minor in philosophy. He credits his passion for history to the Advanced Placement classes he took at Marion County High School.\nGrant also took a variety of science classes while at Vanderbilt to better prepare himself for medical school.\nThat also included studying abroad in London and participating in service trips.\nAfter Vanderbilt, Grant applied and was accepted into the University of Kentucky\u2019s medical school where he graduated last year.\nGrant is now finishing up his first year of residency focusing on anesthesiology. However, his future plans are still somewhat up in the air.\nMuch like his college experience, Grant noted a challenging yet rewarding experience studying a variety of disciplines among his fondest memories from MCPS.\nBut his academic experience in MCPS wasn\u2019t limited to just one area.\nAlso among those experiences, Grant was the captain of the academic team, as well as being heavily involved in BETA club and National Honor Society.\nGrant says that his most important piece of advice for current students is to be conscious of the bigger picture within the world of education."
