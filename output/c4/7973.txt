    "text": "British adventure and environmentalist Lizzie Carr yesterday (18 May 2017) became the first female to solo stand up paddle board the English Channel after a gruelling day on the water.\nThe 24-mile journey from Dungeness to Boulonge took Lizzie seven hours to complete as she battled wind, rain and teeth-chattering temperatures, dodging traffic in the notoriously busy shipping lane as she went.\nIn a post on her Instagram page after completing the paddle, Lizzie said: \u201cI DID IT. Today I became the first female in history to solo paddle board across the English Channel \u2013 and all in the name of #PlasticPatrol.\nLizzie is no stranger to long journeys by paddle board having last year travelled the entire 400-mile length of England\u2019s waterways \u2013 solo and unsupported \u2013 on her Red Paddle Co inflatable board, picking up plastic as she went.\nDuring her paddle across the Channel, Lizzie collected water samples for micro plastic analysis and will subsequently be working closely with Plymouth University to analyse the results. The aim is to build on the links between the big pieces of plastic you see every day, and the detrimental impact that comes about as a result such as micro plastics, plus the journey that they take from inland to the ocean.\nThe work is part of Lizzie\u2019s #PlasticPatrol initiative which has been developed to help combat the global plastic crisis and highlight how 80% of marine debris comes from inland sources. To find out more about #PlasticPatrol or to get involved head to www.plasticpatrol.co.uk/get-involved.\nKeep up to date with Lizzie\u2019s adventures and environmental work by following her on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram or by heading to www.lizzieoutside.co.uk."
