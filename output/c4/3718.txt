    "text": "Activist shareholders in Australia\u2019s largest independent coalminer are expected to vote in record numbers on Thursday to demand Whitehaven Coal aligns its long-term company strategy with the Paris climate agreement.\nGuardian Australia understands the group Market Forces has secured support from some superannuation funds and large overseas investors in Whitehaven for three resolutions that will be put to the company\u2019s annual general meeting in Sydney.\nWill van der Pol, a legal researcher and campaigner at Market Forces, said investors had been \u201creceptive\u201d in recent discussions.\nOne non-binding advisory resolution calls on the company to disclose climate change-related risks to shareholders, in line with recommendations of the Financial Stability Board\u2019s taskforce on climate-related financial disclosures.\nAnother proposal says that shareholders call on the board to make strategy and capital expenditure decisions \u201cconsistent with the climate goals of the Paris agreement\u201d in order to safeguard the longer-term success of the company and respond to risks and opportunities posed by climate change.\n\u201cWe move this resolution in order to ensure our company is protected from stranded asset risks, and poised to take advantage of regulatory and market changes as international action is taken to satisfy the goals established by the Paris climate change agreement,\u201d a supporting statement says.\n\u201cGiven the higher stranding risk of coal assets over oil and gas, coal producers should be acting more urgently than other fossil fuel producers.\nAny substantial level of support would be significant, considering Whitehaven is a pure-play coalminer.\nThe company released a statement to the ASX on 5 October that indicated it would consider climate risk reporting in 2019, a move interpreted as a concession to activist shareholders. It followed an Australian Securities and Investments Commission report last month critical of the level of climate risk disclosures by companies.\n\u201cWhitehaven is committed to playing a role in reducing carbon emissions ... by promoting increased use of Whitehaven\u2019s high-quality, low-emissions coal,\u201d the company said in its statement to the ASX.\nWhitehaven\u2019s future planning is based on the \u201cNew Policies Scenario\u201d of the International Energy Agency, under which coal demand to Asia would double by 2040. Under that scenario, global warming would increase to about 2.7 degrees above pre-industrial levels by 2100.\nUnder a Paris baseline scenario modelled by the IEA, international demand for thermal coal would halve by 2040.\nVan de Pol said the resolutions at Thursday\u2019s Whitehaven AGM were \u201can opportunity for investors to make their mark and say this is exactly what we expect companies to be doing\u201d.\n\u201cThese sorts of resolutions are about the long-term sustainability of these companies,\u201d he said.\nClimate activists have increasingly switched from the coalface to the boardroom in recent years, where campaigns for large investors to divest from fossil fuels have gathered pace.\nAt last week\u2019s AGM for the Queensland-based freight rail company Aurizon, investor proxies asked repeated questions about the company\u2019s role in hauling coal and its potential to support operations in the Galilee Basin.\nThe Aurizon chairman, Tim Poole, told the meeting the company\u2019s coal freight rail network had a higher risk profile than other utilities and that the company was concerned about \u201cstranded asset risk\u201d.\n\u201cAt some point in the next 50 years, renewable energy might be such that we might not be hauling as much thermal coal as we are today ... part of our system might not be required,\u201d Poole said."
