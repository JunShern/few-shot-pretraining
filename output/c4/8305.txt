    "text": "Occupational diseases may occur if a worker works in a harmful environment with toxins. For example, many workers who were exposed to asbestos developed cancer and were able to collect compensation through workers' compensation lawsuits. Workers compensation benefits are provided to workers who acquire an occupational disease from a dangerous work environment.\nIf you have acquired an occupational disease you first should contact your employer and discuss your compensation options through your employer's workers' compensation insurance. Generally an employer will have insurance to compensate you for lost wages and medical expenses due to an occupational disease. If your employer does not have workers' compensation insurance or the amount they are willing to pay does not fully compensate you for your losses you can talk to a work comp lawyer about your options to get a larger work comp settlement or file a personal injury claim against your employer.\nAnswer these short questions so we can determine the strength of your claim.\nWas the other driver driving a commercial vehicle?\nJust A Few More Steps!\nBy submitting your information, you agree to the Terms & Conditions.
