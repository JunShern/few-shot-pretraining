    "text": "One trend that I'm seeing a ton of for this Fall/Winter is military inspired details. I have to admit I'm not immune. I love classic peacoats, brass buttons & buckles and tall, flat boots. There are jackets and capes at every price point - from $89.50 at Delias to $150 - $325 at Urban Outfitters (when did UO get so expensive!?). I'm in love with the Kate Moss for TopShop cape but unless I win the lottery, I'm afraid I won't be sporting it any time soon. There is an amazing little jacket ending on Ebay today. I'm betting it goes for a pretty penny. Agathe from StyleBytes seems to have found the perfect one (she even added her own military patches) that she cleverly wears with girly dresses. Since none of these lovely items are in my budget, I think my nod to the military trend will come in the form of these leg warmers with brass snaps. I think they would look great peeking out of the top of my boots.\nThis is actually my raincoat but since it never rains here I never get a chance to wear it. So I guess you could say for Halloween I've dressed up like someone who hopes it rains soon.\nI guess I'm feeling a bit gothy with Halloween right around the corner. No dress up party for me this year. You'd think people in Hollywood would be crazy for Halloween, but I've found the opposite to be true. I think people here consider themselves somehow above it all. Oh well. Anyway, I thought I'd share one of my secrets with you. I'm not one of those girls that feels comfortable walking around in a super short skirt where every passing breeze could be the one that shows all your stuff to the world. The answer? One of these from American Apparel. It's like a little pair of shorts built into a tiny little skirt. It acts as a slip and keeps my dress from riding up when I walk and I never have to worry about having a Marilyn Monroe moment. I have one on right now!\nI am so confounded about Cheap Monday jeans. I bought a pair last year when they came in to the store where I work. I'd seen them on many of the street fashion blogs and was really excited to try them out. I got a pair in dark black in my usual size. They seemed stiff but I figured a wash or two would help. To my dismay, no matter how many times I wore and washed them, they remained so stiff and uncomfortable I couldn't wait to take them off at the end of the day. If it's possible for a pair of jeans to make you feel claustrophobic, these jeans did just that. I ended up selling them on EBay.\nI guess my memory of how much I hated them is wearing off because I'm beginning to reconsider them. Blame it on the Scandinavians. I love the way the jeans look in these photos. Super skinny with high waists, they look good with boots or flats, with shirt tucked in or left hanging out.\nNow that the jeans are readily available at Urban Outfitters I'm really tempted to give them another shot. Maybe mine were just stiff because I bought the dark black rinse. Maybe the lighter ones would be softer. Maybe I just need to wash them with some fabric softener. Maybe I'm crazy for even considering it.\non the iPod: Travis \"The Boy With No Name\"\nI had a completely different outfit picked out this morning but at the last second I decided I just wanted to be comfortable today. So, I ended up pulling out all my favorites: favorite jeans, shirt, boots, scarf - and then just threw on the vest to mix it up a bit. That seems to be happening a lot lately.\nThere's a new batch of goodies in the store today. Loads of Fall sweaters and cute 80's dress. More to come. I'm going to try to post some shoes and boots this weekend. I wish there were more hours in a day!\nI used to feel like I was the target audience for Nylon magazine. In the past year or so I think they've either switched audiences or I've begun to grown out of it. Either way, I still really enjoy most of their fashion editorials. For instance, this month's take on Annie Hall in Central Park. I like the mix of boyish vests and oxfords with girlier bow blouses and knee socks. And who wouldn't want to spend Fall in Central Park?\nFor the past two days I've witnessed some of the most spectacular sunrises I've ever seen. The sky has been so colorful that the sunlight coming in our apartment has been bright orange. The smoke is so thick on the horizon from all the surrounding fires that it looks like some kind of atomic sunrise. I'll be glad when it finally clears.\non the iPod: Band of Horses \"Cease to Begin\"\nThese shoes are one of the things I kept from my thrifting trip back home. I normally would not wear white shoes, but I was inspired by all the white-shoe-wearing over on Moderniteter. Other than that, there's not too much exciting going on with this ensemble. I had to throw in the towel this morning. That's it! I give in! Mother Nature, you win. It's 92 and I cannot wear tights and boots today."
