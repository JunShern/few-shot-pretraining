    "text": "James Baldwin\u2019s \u201cSonny\u2019s Blues\u201d is a story that always manages to surprise me because it just works. There is, of course, tremendous style and skill in the execution. But there is nothing ostentatious: no cheap jumps or surprises, no shifts in voice, no postmodern irruptions by the writer. \u201cSonny\u2019s Blues\u201d is simply an intense story with high stakes. Sonny will either manage to live in this world or, in his great desperation and pain, fall to heroin. This life or death conflict lies naked on the page, so that every word, spoken and narrated, must either point to it or pointedly talk around it, each word advancing the cause of one or the other outcome. Because there is no gimmick to it, because there is honesty and bluntness in the telling of the story, Baldwin is able to rest the world on Sonny\u2019s shoulders. As the story goes on, Baldwin returns again and again to the pronoun \u201cwe\u201d and to apocalyptic metaphor. A story about a man convincingly becomes a story about a nation, and a story about human beings. It is not only Sonny\u2019s fate that remains undecided at the end of the story; the apocalyptic \u201ccup of trembling\u201d that sits at the top of Sonny\u2019s piano in the final sentence is meant for all of us.\nEva responds, but doesn\u2019t really respond; that might make her vulnerable. It is typical of most communication in the collection, sensitive negotiations conducted between two hostile parties rather than any sort of genuine exchange. Characters seize on key phrases, remember them exactly, and quote them ad nauseum, as if they were valuable bargaining chips: \u201cAnyway, he told me once that love was not a real thing because it was comprised of too many subsidiary emotions.\u201d Dialogue, for Evans\u2019 characters, is war by other means.\nI let out a hushed oath when I read that passage for the first time, as if the characters were sitting right next to me in a crowded restaurant and I was afraid of being overheard. I honestly felt, to my own surprise, scandalized. You know these characters shouldn\u2019t get a pass for their behavior, but you don\u2019t quite blame them for it either. They know a certain pitiless brutality to be an immutable truth of life. Tara, of \u201cSnakes,\u201d puts it nicely: \u201cI felt like somebody ought to stop me from walking out, like there was a rule that you couldn\u2019t leave behind such palatable need.\u201d But, as she well knows, there isn\u2019t. So she does walk out.\nEvans\u2019 collection, however, is all about attending to that palatable need. Like Baldwin and Morrison, Evans belongs to the branch of black literary humanism that, simply by recognizing its characters as people, carries with it an implicit social mission. These stories are written with such detail and attention that it sometimes feels like a personal letter, written by one black woman for another, by one loving person for another. It feels necessary. Somebody should tell these women that they are not alone and that they matter.\nWhat makes this collection great is that moral mission, the way that the collection serves as a testament to the value of the individuals whose stories it tells. Race is here, of course. Race cannot help but be here, in every tiny crack and crevice, tainting everything from sunscreen to school pranks. Race cuts and bruises and scars the characters of this collection. But beyond their intricate filigrees of defensiveness, beyond the ways that others insist on seeing them, the characters of Before You Suffocate Your Own Fool Self are people. They want those awfully basic things that can be expressed in simple, declarative thrusts: I want to be loved, I want your love, I want a real family. These primary human dramas are what ultimately drive the stories in the collection, and the need in these stories is so obvious and strong that it levels the heart. Such an insistent demand for love should be heard; it is worthy of being chronicled in books. There isn\u2019t a rule that you can\u2019t leave behind such palatable need, of course. We know this. But the gap between what we know and what we think should be is the place from which great literature often emerges. There isn\u2019t such a rule, but as Danielle Evans persuasively argues, there ought to be.\nI tend to like and lean towards creative things made by womenfolk\u2014perhaps it has to do with being handed a Cibo Matto mixtape at a crucial point of adolescence or deciding to major in post-1945 yonic-ceramic-art-history in college (yes! I really did this!); yellow-wallpapered observations are always my default reads. But this year, I found myself reading almost exclusively female writers\u2013and more specifically, their collections of short stories. As Lorrie Moore puts it (best, always best), I have entered \u201cthat awful stage of life between twenty-six to and thirty-seven known as stupidity,\u201d and the best way I\u2019ve found to navigate\u2014or at least subsist within\u2014it are these compact little morsels of ladywriting, with beginnings, middles, and ends. I blame the Internet and Saturn\u2019s return.\nMy favorite discovery this year was Canadian bookseller Deborah Willis, whose debut collection Vanishing and Other Stories really floored me. Willis has this airy, almost giggly writing voice that sounds like a Valley Girl gifted with an Oxford education (example: \u201cWhat I did understand, later but still way before Claudia did, was that it was impossible. That we could never break free. No matter what we did, we could never separate them from us. Our bodies were built by the lentils and flax they\u2019d fed us. Their bone structure lingered in our faces.\u201d) The title story in her collection is told by a woman whose neurotic author father mysteriously left his attic office one day and just never returned\u2014the narrator is still stunned by it after so many years, this spectral longing, this losing a person due to the fact that they simply do not wish to be found. If you have time to read one more short story this year, consider making that one it.\nWillis\u2019 work reminded me a bit, but not too much, of Aimee Bender\u2019s wonderful, casual magical realism, which I am (utterly, blushingly) ashamed to say was a 2010 revelation. Her latest novel, The Particular Sadness of Lemon Cake\u2013about people who eat their feelings in every literal way\u2013was one of my favorite long reads this year, but I found myself gravitating more often in quiet moments to her debut story collection, The Girl in the Flammable Skirt, which contains one of the best descriptions of losing love I\u2019ve found. A woman\u2019s lover experiences \u201creverse evolution,\u201d becoming a monkey, then a salamander-like primitive creature that she must let out to sea. \u201cSometimes I think he\u2019ll wash up on shore,\u201d she writes. \u201cA naked man with a startled look. Who has been to history and back.\u201d And isn\u2019t that what we all want from past loves? Bewilderment and a sudden return to our stoop. Point: Bender.\nThe last woman-penned story collection I read was Michele Latiolais\u2019 forthcoming Widow, which is weird and sad and compulsive and continues to stick to my ribs. Latiolais writes about grief in such a raw way\u2014she joins the general pantheon of No-More-Husband literature (high priestess: J-Did), but her style is so unique as to be another genre altogether.\nAnd also! Danielle Evans\u2019 Before You Suffocate Your Own Fool Self, which nails so much in so little space.\nThere are many ways to measure a year, but the reader is likely to measure it in books. There was the novel that felt as fresh and full of promise as the new year in January, the memoir read on the bus to and from work through the grey days of March, the creased paperback fished from a pocket in the park in May, the stacks of books thumbed through and sandy-paged, passed around at the beach in August, the old favorite read by light coming in the window in October, and the many books in between. And when we each look back at our own years in reading, we are almost sure to find that ours was exactly like no other reader\u2019s.\nThe end of another year brings the usual frothy and arbitrary accounting of the \u201cbest\u201d this and the \u201cmost\u201d that. But might it also be an opportunity to look back, reflect, and share? We hope so, and so, for a seventh year, The Millions has reached out to some of our favorite writers, thinkers, and readers to name, from all the books they read this year, the one(s) that meant the most to them, regardless of publication date. Grouped together, these ruminations, cheers, squibs, and essays will be a chronicle of reading and good books from every era. We hope you find in them seeds that will help make your year in reading in 2011 a fruitful one.\nAs we have in prior years, the names of our 2010 \u201cYear in Reading\u201d contributors will be unveiled one at a time throughout the month as we post their contributions.

In it, he wrote that he wished books with more than 10% of \u201cteenage girl content\u201d came with an advisory warning. This way, he could avoid them. This was puzzling to me. If a book had a label that said, \u201cWarning! Teenagers Inside!\u201d I would be more likely to pick it up. Doesn\u2019t every reader, male or female, young or old, find that phase of life to be particularly dramatic, moving, screwed up, and beautiful? I loved the teenagers that populated Egan\u2019s latest novel, especially Rhea, who narrates the chapter/story \u201cAsk Me if I Care,\u201d and not only because she\u2019s a freckle-face like I was (am). She\u2019s vulnerable and wise, and also incredibly naive, too. Her desires are painfully strong, and yet she cannot totally understand them.\nTeenagers have a real drive to be independent, to discover and define (or defy) their identities. And yet, they\u2019re also powerless. They have their parents\u2019 will to contend with, and their friends\u2019 complicated codes of behavior. They have the secret shames of the body. They long for the purity and ease of childhood even as they fling themselves into the dangers of adulthood. In short, they make for compelling characters.\nBooks about teenage boys, it seems to me, are often about a rage that is hard to control and understand. Jim Shepard\u2019s Project X is a fine example of the genre. About a Columbine-style act of school violence, and the two eighth grade boys who perpetrate it, the novel is engrossing, compassionate, and oddly mundane in its faithful depiction of contemporary American adolescence. Whenever I think of Go-gurts, I think of this book.\nI haven\u2019t yet read Patterns of Paper Monsters by Emma Rathbone, but I want to. Narrated by seventeen year-old Jacob Higgins, who is sent to a juvenile correctional facility for committing a violent crime, the book has been described as sad and funny, and The Daily Beast promises \u201cthere\u2019s no sappy uplift here.\u201d At The New Yorker Book Bench blog, Eileen Reynolds writes that Jacob, \u201cmay be cut from the same cloth as Holden Caulfield, but he\u2019s a good bit funnier and a lot less mopey than the angsty adolescent male narrators from many coming-of-age books that have followed Catcher in the Rye.\u201d He sounds like a narrator I could fall in love with.\nJane Eyre. According to a footnote in my edition, Charlotte Bronte\u2019s novel about the poor, unloved orphan who falls for that creep Mr. Rochester is probably the first occurrence of a first-person narration by a child in British literature. Perhaps that\u2019s what renders this book so intimate and authentic. Jane is a complex, independent woman, and her storytelling is modern and hyper-conscious. I\u2019ve always loved Jane\u2019s bookishness, her honesty, and her plain looks. It\u2019s her evolution from child to woman that provides us with a panoramic understanding of her character.\nMick Kelly. It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve read The Heart is a Lonely Hunter by Carson McCullers. I have a terrible memory, but this novel\u2019s teenage protagonist is never really far from my mind. Mick dresses like a boy. She feels trapped in her small Southern town. She is composing a symphony in her head called \u201cThis Thing I Want, I Know Not What.\u201d That phrase\u2026God, it\u2019s haunted me for years.\nThisbe Casper. Thisbe is the younger of the two teenage daughters in Joe Meno\u2019s most recent novel, The Great Perhaps. She\u2019s a fervent believer in God among a family of nonbelievers, and she also has a crush on her friend Roxie, which fills her with fear and shame. She\u2019s aglow with all kinds of feelings, and I adore her. It\u2019s no surprise that Thisbe was Meno\u2019s favorite character in the book.\nChloe from Charles Baxter\u2019s The Feast of Love. The Feast of Love was on my list of favorite books of the decade, partially because of Chloe\u2019s sections, which are narrated with a raw, kinetic energy. Chloe\u2019s boyfriend is pierced-up Oscar with \u201cthe blond hair, the snaggle-toothed smile, the bomb-shelter eyes.\u201d I\u2019m not sure how old Chloe is (if it said in the book, I don\u2019t remember), but she seems about nineteen to me \u2014 she\u2019s got that reckless hopefulness in her. At the beginning of her first section, she says of her and Oscar, \u201cWe were swoon machines,\u201d and I, the reader, swoon myself. I love that Baxter marries colloquialisms and cliche with striking, unique turns of phrase to get at a teenager\u2019s way of moving through the world.\n\u201cNah,\u201d he said, and I didn\u2019t know whether to feel pissed off or pretty.\nThis exchange captures so well what it feels like to be that age: wanting approval, and respect, and also wanting to be desired, even if you don\u2019t feel that desire back. I\u2019m looking forward to reading the rest of Evans\u2019s stories, to see how she deepens her exploration of this puzzling and complex demographic. Something tells me she will.\nWriting this almost makes me want to write another book about a teenager. Almost \u2014 it\u2019s not easy, throwing yourself into that world again. But I could read dozens of books about teenagers. Dozens! And those warning stickers? They\u2019d help."
