The inspiring group also dismantled and removed a 20\u2032 table and assembled 8 new classroom tables for our Vocational Training Program at Duvall Homes\u2019 Opportunities Enrichment Center.\nWe are most grateful for their hard work, and were impressed with the speed and commitment in which it was completed.\nA special thank you to Commander M. Juanique Wallace of Navy Recruiting District Jacksonville; and to Chief Jericus Lewis, NCI Jason Stoudt, HM2 Jennifer Denis, QM1 Abbe Beaston and AWF2 Kenneth Connelly from DeLand\u2019s Navy Recruiting Station.\nMarch 21, 2019 \u2013 Direct Support Professional, Jessica, personalized a blanket for a long-time resident of Duvall, Snookie.\n\u201cIt is so beautiful and kind of Jessica to do this for my Snookie,\u201d said Tess, who visits her daughter every week during Adult Day Training on our beautiful Glenwood campus.\nTess champions all Duvall staff, praising their efforts and dedication to caring for those we serve.\nFebruary 7, 2019 \u2013 When it comes to building a new group home for individuals with special needs, there is a great deal more to consider than there is for your average home. And such a project demands a special builder \u2014 one with years of construction experience, insight and patience. After a monthslong search, Marsha Shankleton, Duvall Homes\u2019 Chief Operating Officer, found the perfect builder.\nFunded in part by a grant from the Florida Housing Finance Corporation, last spring Duvall began the long process of searching for a parcel of land in West Volusia, proximal to public transportation and large enough to build a 3300 SqFt. home for six residents with Down syndrome, Autism, Cerebral Palsy and other disabilities who are cared for 24-7 by trained and certified Direct Support Professionals. The home would need both living and office space, a spacious porch and grounds for enjoying the outdoors, and sufficient parking for special needs vehicles. A 2.5-acre plot was obtained in North DeLand.\nSo who is the builder? \u201cWe needed someone who knew how to marry the commercial safety of a sprinkler system, fire and carbon monoxide alarms and adequate parking, with the comfort and privacy of group home living,\u201d said Shankelton.\nView additional images from the build of Duvall Homes\u2019 new Group Home on our Facebook Page here.\nFebruary 5, 2019 \u2013 In Duvall Homes\u2019 Adult Day Training Program, at our Opportunities Enrichment Center, participants develop skills to help them achieve the highest level of independence possible. Great volunteer experiences result from this training, like bagging at our local Publix.\nLearn more about Duvall\u2019s Day Training Program.\nJanuary 30, 2019 \u2013 Duvall staff and residents cherish our community of volunteers! Thank you to the student volunteers of Father Lopez Catholic High School who recently sanded, cleaned, primed and painted 4 large picnic tables on the grounds of Duvall\u2019s Glenwood campus in DeLand.\nOnce the weather warmed, the tables were enjoyed by participants in Duvall\u2019s Adult Day Training Program following an outdoor stroll. There are also some fun \u201cartistic\u201d plans for these beautiful, now like-new, picnic tables, which will incorporate Duvall\u2019s Art For Everyone Program.\nIf you know of a group of students, or employees, interested in providing service for Duvall Homes, please contact lhabermehl@duvallhomes.org. Come be a part of #TheDuvallDifference!\nJanuary 11, 2019 \u2013 Duvall Homes celebrates the new year by sharing a sneak peek at the home site of our new group home going up in DeLand! It will have six spacious bedrooms and four Jack and Jill bathrooms, a front and back porch, a full sprinkler system and other outstanding features.\nStaff are all so excited. Many more details, including photos and video, will be shared in the coming weeks and months. Duvall Homes is in good hands with Camelot Custom Construction, Inc., the Parade of Homes Award Winner Builder, who renovated one of Duvall\u2019s 16 group homes last year.\nFollow Duall Homes on Facebook to view the latest construction photos.\nDecember 24, 2018 \u2013 Happy Holidays to the hardworking staff of Duvall Homes, most of whom will continue to work through the holiday season caring for our Duvall Community Family, 24/7.\nCEO, Steven DeVane, draws several employee names from all departments with CFO, Karen Kummerer, for random gifts.\nThe dedicated team had some fun this past week. Names were drawn for prizes, guesses submitted for the Tower of Candy, T-shirts that read \u201cYou Are Part Of #TheDuvallDifference\u201d were given out and other surprises.\nA sincere thank you to the parents and families who supported the 2018 holiday bonus, to the caring Board of Regents who provides support and professional advocacy throughout the year, and to Duvall Homes\u2019 Leadership Team, led by Duvall Homes CEO, Steven DeVane. Read more on Employee Appreciation.\nDecember 23, 2018 \u2013 Happy Holidays from Duvall Homes! Earlier in the month, after decorating the halls of our Opportunities Enrichment Center, residents attended the Pierson Lions Club annual Christmas party.\nEveryone was entertained with live holiday music, a BBQ dinner and dessert prior to Santa\u2019s arrival with gifts. Duvall Homes is grateful for the generosity shown by the Lions Club.\nOnly a few images were captured as we are in the middle of securing new photo releases for the protection of our residents. Thank you for your understanding. Just note, the residents had a fantastic experience.\nBe sure to follow Duvall news and social media posts (bottom of page) for inspiring news and events, and for additional images as releases are received.\nDecember 18, 2018 \u2013 A few weeks ago, Duvall\u2019s Day Training Program began the process to adopt a US Military Soldier through AdoptaUSSoldier.org. We want our service members to know we are thinking of them and want to thank them for their service.\nA deployed unit has now been matched with Duvall Homes and the collection of requested items has begun.\nIn a short time, approximately 70 items were collected; however, more is needed. The plan is to correspond with Adopt A US Soldier \u2013 Official and support our assigned unit, not just for the holidays, but through 2019. Packages will be sent out every other month.\nDecember 14, 2018 \u2013 Rendever is an award-winning tech company out of Boston that is laser focused on improving the lives of others. Their sensory platform, operated by caregivers, helps engage special populations. Watch their video on CBS. So, how does Duvall fit in? Because possible benefits for people with developmental disabilities were recognized, we reached out to the Rendever team. As a result, a plan was set in motion for Duvall to test their virtual reality 360\u00b0 equipment. And empowerment through VR emerged.\nRand\u2019s background is in Neuroscience and Biomedical Engineering. Rendever\u2019s CTO, Tom Neumann\u2019s, is a successful developer of VR applications. Since cofounding Rendever in 2016, Rand and Neumann have embarked on a journey to share their unique platform all over the world.\nADT Support Specialist, Cindy Jakobowski, experiences life on a farm in VR \u2013 one of numerous 360 Rendever videos engaged by residents.\nRendever continues to expand its reach. Their software is not just in retirement communities and long-term care facilities; they\u2019re in single family homes and even cancer treatment centers. Among other things, Rendever\u2019s platform provides a diversion for pain and anxiety.\nDuvall Homes is fortunate to be given the opportunity to sample this innovative VR program, and are grateful to Rand and the Rendever team. While additional time is needed to determine the full benefits for clients of Duvall Homes, one thing is certain. Duvall\u2019s team of Direct Support Professionals, Specialists and clients were able to explore a whole new universe. And, for a time, were taken to parts of the world they would otherwise not have gone.\nWatch Steven (top image) pilot a single engine prop plane with Wings of Storm, a Croatian Air Force Aerobatic Team.\nRead Expanding Worlds with additional VR photos in Duvall\u2019s 2018 Fall Newsletter.\nDecember 11, 2018 \u2013 Duvall is in Daytona\u2019s MY COAST. Highlights from Duvall\u2019s 2018 Inspiration Gala are inside December\u2019s MY COAST Magazine. The lifestyle publication is produced by The Daytona Beach News-Journal.\nSpecial events that took place this past quarter across Coastal and West Volusia areas, including Flagler, are spotlighted in the SEEN section.\nDuvall\u2019s Inspiration Gala took place on September 28, 2018.

Matt, a relatively new Support Specialist, guessed the closest number of candies inside the Tower of Candy without going over. The seven stacked containers had 547 pieces of candy. Lotto tickets, tea towels and money were inside the 17-inch tall tower. In total, Matt won a prize valued at more than $100, which was part of some employee appreciation holiday fun.\nAccounts Receivable Specialist, Bobbie Daley, won a surprise 2nd Place gift because she guessed the next closest amount without going over. Bobbie celebrated 10 years at Duvall this past June!\nDuvall\u2019s Chief Operating Officer, Marsha Shankleton, presented the prizes. The holiday fun is part of a larger We Appreciate You employee celebration that began the week prior to Thanksgiving. Management gave each employee a Publix gift card with a thank you letter from Duvall\u2019s CEO, Steven DeVane.\nMore holiday fun employee appreciation is to come!\nNovember 29, 2018 \u2013 Enjoy Volusia County when you visit Duvall. Flip through this month\u2019s issue of Evolve, the business publication of the Daytona Regional Chamber of Commerce to learn more. Duvall Homes is a Daytona Chamber member, and recognizes that what attracts families and guardians to Duvall is not just our residential supportive services and programs, but also the national appeal of the County of Volusia.\nOceanfront beaches, great eateries and ecotourism \u2013 from the east side of the county to the west \u2013 are just a few options to fill calendars of visiting families and friends all year round. Visit our great beaches; tour various springs and waterways; bike, jog or walk miles of natural and paved trails; select from any type of cuisine you can think of; visit historical landmarks, museums and more.\nThe best thing of all is that residents of Duvall Homes are fortunate to be able to visit the same attractions that 10 million people come to visit each and every year.

After flipping through Evolve Magazine here, click on some of the great videos below, courtesy of West Volusia Visiting Center, to help fill your calendar when you plan your visit.\nNovember 20, 2018 \u2013 Thank you to the youth ministry of Pass A Grille Beach Community Church PagChurch.org for reaching out to Duvall Homes. They chose us as their selected nonprofit to volunteer their outreach services.\nEarlier this month, on Saturday, November 10, more than 30 students and leaders travelled from St. Pete\u2019s Beach, Florida, to DeLand as part of their Mystery Service weekend. They did not know where they were traveling or for who they were volunteering \u2013 a rather fun way to engage youth in leadership service rolls.\nAfter arriving and learning a brief history of the Duvall mission, the students went to work painting fences and parking poles, collecting landscape debris and organizing McGaffin Hall at our Glenwood Campus.\nThese inspiring youth are committed to improving the lives of others. They use their hands and hearts to help nonprofit organizations not just in Florida, but across the US and world! We wish them great blessings as they head to Puerto Rico this coming spring!\nThank you to Jeanne Haemmelmann, Associate Minister for Youth & Young Adults of Pass-A-Grille Church for organizing their morning of service.
