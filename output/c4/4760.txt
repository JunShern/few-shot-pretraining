Which produces thousands of different people with the same name doing the same thing when you search for them on the web. Use your name. I use mine and it isn't easy to pronounce or spell but it doesn't matter if someone searches for something like Armand Cabrera Artist my name will come up with the auto correct in the search engine Get good at what you do and people will learn to spell and pronounce your name correctly.\nLast edited by the-muddy; July 22nd, 2016 at 01:02 PM.\nI use my real name since it would eventually help me stand out. You could go with Iris Madelina or Iris Madeline if you don't want to use your last name in promos. Or Apostolescu-arts. Either way it will stand out.\nI struggle with this too... I like signing my screen name Ennex because my first name is very common and my last name, while unique, is complicated and something I am certain I will change through marriage as soon as I am able. It's such a hassle...it gets entered in computer systems wrong ALL the time. I even had to fix my social security card... =\\ If I stick with my current partner, my full name will end up being incredibly generic anyways.\nI see on your tumblr you use Iris Muddy and that kind of stands out and has a nice ring to it. Or both your first name and middle name are really nice sounding and unique, you could use either and have it still be professional.\nBut if the Gematria of your name is bad, nothing will further.\nMadalina Apostolescu. Your name is lovely and unique. Don't hide it, no matter how difficult it is to pronounce, though I think it has a nice rhythm to it personally. It makes you stand out from the crowd.\nThere are plenty of artists out there with difficult names and it hasn't caused them any problems. Be proud of your uniqueness, don't hide from it.\nSketchBook: ANyone have any good advice for a beginning artist? 16 yr. old artist? Thank you.."
