With the heat of summer behind us and the tundra of winter still ahead, there are a lot of things to do in the District and the weather is often cooperative. Here are some ideas of things to do before and after Quality Talks in Washington DC!\nDC is known for its national monuments and museums. Most are free to view or attend and with such a variety, there\u2019s something for everyone. Located on the National Mall, you\u2019ll find the city\u2019s collection of Smithsonian museums including the National Museum of American History, National Museum of Natural History, National Air and Space Museum, National Museum of the American Indian, National Museum of African American History and Culture and the National Gallery of Art. All of the museums are well worth your time, but you might want to pick one or two to prioritize depending on how long your stay is. Another popular museum in town, though not part of the Smithsonian Institute, is the Newseum. Located in close proximity to the National Mall, the Newseum explores history through the eyes of the press.\nMost of DC\u2019s national monuments are also located near the National Mall and can be seen via foot or by one of the many bus or trolley tours offered. If you want to check out all of the monuments the tour is your best bet.\nThe Capitol Visitors Center opened in 2008 and is serves as the welcome center to our nation\u2019s capitol building. While the Capitol is a working office building, it also serves as a national monument and is open to the public for tours. You can book a tour through the Capitol Visitor\u2019s Center by visiting their website, or contact your congressional representative. While you are visiting the capitol, you can check out the Supreme Court and Library of Congress both of which are located near the Capitol complex.\nDC has an array of shopping experiences to choose from. From local neighborhood markets to larger, more commercial areas \u2013 there\u2019s plenty of places to visit. Georgetown is home to about 500 shops and restaurants and is located near the Potomac River. It\u2019s a historic neighborhood so you can enjoy views of quaint, historic homes nestled between shops. If you don\u2019t want to venture to Georgetown, check out DC\u2019s new CityCenter retail hub. DC\u2019s newest shopping area, CityCenter boasts higher end brands such as Burberry, Louis Vuitton and Gucci. If you are looking for something more local, check out Union and Eastern Markets. With local food and retail vendors, both locations offer a more local feel.\nWant to explore the city further?
