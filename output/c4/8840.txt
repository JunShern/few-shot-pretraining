    "text": "If you are interested in blogging and happen to be a newbie on this field, then it\u2019s essential that you understand a few things about what a blog is, how to start a blog and how does it generally work in the big scheme of things.\nHow to actually start a blog and make money?\nHow to allow your readers to read about the subject you are blogging about?\nHow to make money blogging as a new blogger with no clue?\nHow to make money from blogs to supplement or replace your income?\nThere are many ways on how to start a blog on the internet.\non a particular subject or issue using the web platform.\nThere is a difference between a blog and a website.\nA blog requires more content to be updated frequently and to keep it fresh so the intended audience can come back for more inspiring information without losing interest.\nA website, on the other hand, performs a specific function and tend to have static content that doesn\u2019t require to be updated as frequently as a blog.\nA blog offers more user engagement and tends to have specific elements, such as comments, categories, archives and authorship.\nA bit similar to what I am offering with my blog here.\nThese topics are very close to my heart and wanted to share them with my readers in the hope they will get value out of it and will help them in their business\u2019s journey just like how they have been helping me in mine.\nYour topic of blogging may be completely different to mine.\nIt all depends on your interest, passion and what you really want to share with your audience.\nThis is related to choosing a suitable blog niche, business idea or topic for your blog.\nWe will touch a little bit more on this subject later on in the article.\nFirst thing first, you have to start out by choosing a platform for your blog.\nThis is where you are going to host it.\nYou have a choice of hosting your blog for free or paying for it with a hosting account of your own.\nThere are some very distinct differences between using a free platform and one that comes with your hosting account.\nNote: If you choose to go with a free blogging account you will have fewer options for customization, and you will not have or own a unique domain name which is highly recommended.\nNow, if you are an internet marketer, blogger or entrepreneur, it is imperative that you understand the importance of owning your own domain name.\nPartly, because it is a way to brand yourself and also a means for getting higher rankings in the search engines.\nThis can lead to more traffic, which translates to more money in your pocket.\nThose that choose to spend a little bit of money on getting a hosting account can also get their own domain.\nThis is the best way to start blogging for beginners because it is not expensive and it will help you see more success from your blog.\nYou are free to choose whatever platform that takes your fancy, however, I strongly recommend you choose WordPress as your primary choice.\nFeel free to share this table on your site just remember to kindly attribute it back to my article.\nWordPress.org has so many benefits in comparisons to the free platforms.\nAs a business owner, you want to make sure you have full control of your site and the freedom to make important decisions to help grow your business with no limitations being placed upon you.\nAfter you have selected your blogging platform, you will need to choose a niche for your blog.\nThe blog niches you select will provide a basis for writing articles that you are going to share and engage with your audience.\nThis will make it easier for you to fill your blog with content that your readership wants to read.\nIt is also always advisable to choose profitable blog niches or blog ideas that will make you money in the long run.\nAfter all, you are investing valuable time, money and effort to some extent and will want to reap the rewards for your effort.\nI am going to assume that your intention for starting your blog is for business purposes.\nWhere you intend to create awesome content to share with your audience as well as being able to monetize your site to grow your business and make a profit from it.\nChoosing a Hosting company that will host your site to make sure it is fully functional, supported and operational 24 hours, 365 days with no problem.\nThere are tons of companies available in the marketplace to purchase your domain and web hosting.\nSome are good and some are not so good.\nDo your homework and read reviews on each company before deciding on your purchase.\nEnsure the hosting plan you select offers the best solution for you, in terms of the services provided, the length of the contract and the ability to meet the needs of your business.\nDepending on where you are in the world, you will find there are a lot of companies to choose from, offering different deals.\nChoose the packages that are best suited to the needs of your business, affordable and come with a reliable service.\nFor this, I highly recommend Wealthy Affiliates. It is what I use to host a number of my sites.\nOnce you have chosen a domain and hosting, you will then create an account to be used in your WordPress site.\nThe next step you need to take is to install WordPress for your site.\nDepending on the hosting company you select, you will follow the installation instructions as given.\nThe video below demonstrates how to install WordPress using SiteGround control panel.\nA lot of pro bloggers use SiteGround and I hear a lot of positive vibe from the blogging community about it.\nThis can also be an option for you when considering to purchase a domain.\nIf you have chosen a free platform you will not have many choices for design, but if you go with WordPress.org you can download and install one of the many free or paid themes for your design.\nThis makes the design of your blog much more professional and you can get a theme that fits your niche much better as well.\nYou want to make sure you choose a design that is attractive, functional and offers a good user experience for your readers.\nYour design should be lightweight, responsive and mobile-friendly.\nIt should also support an array of digital devices such as desktops, tablets, and smartphones.\nAfter choosing a blog niche, you will need to create a brand for your blog.\nBased on your chosen niche, blog idea, domain or business name.\nThink about a blog name that you like.\nDraft the design for your logo. This can be fun, that is if you like to experiment and don\u2019t mind getting your hands dirty.\nTools like Canva are ideal, and come with pre-loaded templates ready for you to hit the ground running with no time.\nIf designing is not your thing, you can always hire someone else to do it for you.\nEnlist the service of a freelancer from Fiverr.com or Upworks.com for few dollars depending on how fancy you want it to be.\nBasic design can start from $5 or higher.\nSee what works for you and go for it.\nYou can always change your design at a later stage if you don\u2019t like what you have got.\nOne of the final steps is to write and post quality content on your blog.\nThis may be one of the last things you do, but you will want to do it consistently for a long period of time.\nThis is how you will get traffic because your posts will hopefully get listed in the search results for any keyword phrases you are targeting.\nThere is a whole science to content creation.\nResearching the article you are going to write about.\nQuick tip: Before you start to write your article, ask yourself if this is something your readers would want to read and can benefit from it.\nWill they learn any lessons from it?\nWill it solve the problems they are having?\nWill it answer the questions they are asking?\nWill, it educate, inspire and inform them about the issues you are writing about?\nIs there a point in writing the article in the first place?\nNote: It is important to make sure you adopt certain checks before you hit the publish button such as Blogging and SEO as mentioned above.\nThis is so to make sure your article is in full compliance with blogging and SEO rules.\nIt will also help you avoid a lot of headaches down the road.\nWatch this video from Data Driven Lab to see how you can create a new post using the new Gutenberg editor in WordPress 5.0.\nThe final piece of the puzzle is to promote and market your blog to the masses out there.\nAfter all the hard work you put in, you want to make sure you share and showcase your creative writing to your intended audience.\nThere are many methods you can use to promote your blog.\nHowever, since this is a gentle quick guide on how to start a blog for beginners.\nI would say It is better to stick with writing articles and submitting them to article directories and posting them on your social media channels as frequently as you can.\nThis is known as article marketing.\nWhen you use this method you will not have to spend any money on marketing per say, especially when you are starting out.\nKeep you expenditure as low as much as you can, and only invest in tools or software when it becomes absolutely necessary.\nUtilise all the available free strategies, before embarking on the paid methods as you try to experiment and honing your blogging skills.\nIf your primary purpose for creating a blog was for monitezation , then you will need to learn how to write your content strategically.\nEqually allowing you to make money at the same time.\nThere are a number of things you can do to make money from your blog.\nWe will cover a little bit more on monetization techniques in our future articles.\nStart building your email list as soon as possible.\nThis is the most crucial part of your business and blog which many new bloggers tend to leave out till the last minute.\nYou need to start capturing your target audience very early on in the funnel, partly because it is an effective way to communicate and engage with your subscribers and potential customers for life.\nSEO and social media may come and go, but your email list will hopefully remain with you for a long time.\nAs long as your subscribers have freely agreed to opt into your email list, you will be able to give value, engage, sell and promote your offers to them over and over again.\nYou have many email services to choose from such as Aweber, MailChimp, GetResponse andConvertKit.\nIt is what I use to capture my emails for this blog.\nI find it to be very easy to use and it\u2019s ideal for bloggers.\nIt will allow you to create basic opt-in forms, integrate into your WordPress site, automate, tag and segment your emails.\nTry out ConvertKit for a 30 day FREE trial using this Link.\nCreate an incentive offer to freely give it to your subscribers in exchange for signing up to your email list.\nThe free offer could be an email course, video or a PDF download that gives high value to your target audiences such as a workbook, cheet sheet or an e-book.\nDisplay an-opt in form for the sign-ups in different locations on your blog.\nSuch as a pop-up that displays at set times when a visitor visits your site, on your sidebar, at the beginning, middle or end of your blog posts.\nFrom my experience with this blog, I found pop-ups to have much higher conversions.\nYou can use ConvertKit forms or third-party ones.\nGet a free basic version from SumoMe to get you started quickly without incurring any costs.\nLater on, if you want to get more sophisticated opt-in forms, you can go for the paid versions from vendors such as Lead Pages, SumoMe, Click Funnels, Thrive Leads and OptinMonster among others.\nIf you feel, you are in a position to invest for a paid service then go for it otherwise, I will advise you to first try out the free version.\nNote: Some of these vendors can be very expensive and you may have to pay a monthly subscription to use their services.\nOnce your subscribers have joined your list, you have to start communicating with them on a regular basis so they don\u2019t forget that you exist.\nAim to give value as much as you can.\nYou can offer the latest updates, tips, news, quizzes, promotions, challenges, and inspiration based on your niche.\nLearn how to sell to your target audience but don\u2019t over do it.\nStrike the balance between giving value and occasional selling.\nAfter you have written your article, you need to inform your target audience of your new release.\nAim to get engagement and feedback from what you have written as soon as possible.\nThis is very important, do your best not to ignore it.\nDoing so will help to confirm if your article and online content is helpful, resonating with your audience and there is an appetite for this sort of information.\nIf the response and engagement is well received, then this is a good indication that you are doing the right thing.\nLisa from Lisa J has explained this topic very well in her video featured below.\nBased on the feedback you get back, you can then expand on the topic by producing another peace on a similar or related subject.\nAlternatively, you could also consider creating another medium of the same material but present it in a form of a video, e-book, infographic or a guide.\nThe ideal scenario will be to eventually create a digital or physical product that you could sell to your target audience relating to the very topic you have written but with a more detailed in-depth helpful information.\nIf it is good enough, your readership will most likely not mind buying from you.\nThis is why it is very important to establish trust from the beginning.\nEnhance your credibility by showing that you care and genuinely want the best for your readers.\nWrite an inviting email to your email list and tell them that you have just released a new post.\nLeave a link pointing to your new post.\nCreate engaging social media posts and post to your social media channels as frequent as you can.\nIf you are in a position to invest in a tool that will do the posting automatically for you then this will be ideal.\nPart of being a blogger requires you to engage and network with other bloggers.\nAim to build relationships and friendship by genuinely and sincerely offering value and support to your fellow bloggers and target audience.\nYou learn something from them and they learn something from you.\nThis will help form a basis of building great opportunities to collaborate on something together or do guest posting on each other\u2019s blogs in the near future.\nDevelop a regular habit of visiting and commenting on other people\u2019s blogs and social media posts.\nJoin social media groups and pages relating to your niche. Like and share their posts or leave comments.\nIf you are allowed to leave or promote your links do so but aim to engage and contribute to these online communities as well.\nIt is all about giving and taking, supporting each other so that everyone can succeed with their ventures.\nThere are many pitfalls that you must do your level best to avoid when you start blogging.\nSimilar to starting a new business or learning a new craft, you are more than likely to make mistakes along the way during your blogging journey.\nIf it happens, don\u2019t worry too much about it. You will get better at it as times goes by.\nWe\u2019ve all had to start from position zero.\nLearning as we go along, perfecting our craft as we get more proficient, skillful and confident over time.\nKnow the purpose and mission of your blog, and what value you bring to the market place.\nFigure out who your target audience is and where they hang out.\nAlways aim to be authentic, genuine, sincere and truthful.\nBe your self and don\u2019t try to be some one else.\nWrite from your heart, the juicy content will flow out of you naturally.\nGive awesome value to your readers and write content your readership wants to read and can benefit from it.\nFollow a cohesive consistent structure for your entire blog.\nBuild and maintain good relationships with other bloggers and like minded entrepreneurs in your industry.\nKeep learning how to write and produce quality content. The more you write the quicker you will improve.\nWrite clickable interesting titles that will give you higher engagement and conversions.\nInclude a strong call to action at the end of your articles to guide your audience to the next stage in the sales funnel.\nSuch as to leave you a comment, sign up to your email list, contact you, follow you on your social networks, read articles you recommend, take a survey, watch a video, give feedback, buy something, etc.\nCheck the terms and conditions of each and every service you subscribed to.\nRead the guidelines and ensure you do not violate the rights of the services.\nThis is to help you avoid your accounts being shut down or getting suspended.\nFor example, social media accounts, YouTube, Ads networks, other people\u2019s images such as those downloaded from Google unless they have been specified as free.\nI was alarmed to learn that this happens quite a lot.\nLearn the basics of SEO and Keyword research and ensure you implement them in your articles by default.\nKeep maintaining and promoting your blog posts.\nKeep it fresh and up to date by updating old posts, headlines, landing pages, images, and videos.\nWhen the time is right, start doing guest postings on yours and other people\u2019s blogs.\nAlso, reach out to influencers who could help give you more exposure to your work.\nDo not ignore your site, emails, landing pages and social media analytics. Use the stats to help improve your blog and online content.\nPlan to release your own digital or physical products to sell.\nWhilst affiliate marketing and other business models can make good money for you, you want to make sure you produce something that you can call your own.\nThis is so you can earn 100% profit from it and will be in full control, where the odds are not against you.\nKeep learning and experimenting by honing and perfecting your blogging skills.\nAlways respond to comments even if it is just a one-liner. This is the perfect opportunity to engage and connect with your audience.\nUse your own unique voice and style.\nDon\u2019t choose the wrong niche.\nDon\u2019t forget to send regular emails to your subscribers.\nDon\u2019t copy other people.
