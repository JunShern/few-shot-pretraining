    "text": "Blue Dragon Children's Foundation is a grassroots charity serving children in crisis throughout Vietnam. We believe that every child deserves the best care we can offer. Blue Dragon kids are street kids, children with disabilities, and children who have been trafficked. We rescue kids from danger and slavery, reunite them with their families when we can, and provide all the services needed for recovery and growth.\nThe work to provide care and assistance to these children is only possible because of the generosity of supporters like you.\nHot meals - street kids are always hungry and malnourished. Blue Dragon offers hot, nourishing meals as part of its nutrition program.\nEducation - some children are unable to go to school because their families are too poor.\nSafe Haven - when the girls are rescued from brothels and forced marriages in China, they need accommodation in safe houses while they make their way back to Vietnam. In cases where the girls are unable to live with their families due to social stigma, Blue Dragon helps with their accommodation and living expenses.\nBlue Dragon will provide you with a report of the impact of your donation, and is happy to respond to any queries you may have.\nMonthly donations allow Blue Dragon to plan interventions and design programs more securely. So please consider making a monthly gift!"
