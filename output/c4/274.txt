    "text": "Was it a surprise to you that you were given the arts and culture position?\nNo, there is no surprise when you are a cadre of the ANC because you are deployed anywhere. You are given a five-year contract to do a portfolio and when you are finished, you wait for another one. At no stage do you have a say.\nWhat qualities do you bring to the position?\nPeople say to me you are a minister here but you can\u2019t sing; how can you survive in the sector? It\u2019s not about that.\nIf you attend some of the meetings of the ANC, you will see that I lead revolutionary songs. I know I can command a revolutionary song.\nI will be working with stakeholders and cultural activists and we will be going on a journey together. We will bring our understanding and our connection with young people.\nThis is an area that is, by and large, filled with practitioners who are young, with hopes for the future and dreams.\nWhat would be important would be to bring that strategic leadership to the sector, primarily to co-ordinate the endeavours that have been started by my predecessors.\nWhat are the first things you will tackle?\nOn my first day I had a briefing on what has happened in the department and what we need to do. I immediately raised the issue that we are writing the true history of South Africa through the voices of its people, rather than through colonialists.\nWe need a single national monument where everybody who comes to South Africa will be able to understand our history. It has to be brand- new. No nation has come through what we have come through without that kind of recognition and national monument.\nSouth Africa has a very rich history that needs to be taught properly. Things such as the Anglo-Boer War need to be taught fully, so that we would see that it was a South African war where everyone had a role. There is this strong feeling I have that it is important that we acknowledge all our history.\nOne thing we have to do is measure the contribution of arts to the big picture. Take for instance the yearly jazz festival in Cape Town. When people go there they talk about one aspect, which is tourism, but they forget that at the core it is arts and culture. They go there to connect spiritually with their needs. It is very important. I also want more people coming here to produce movies.\nI see arts as helping a young democracy that is competing with old democracies. We are still finding our way. I want to see South Africans being given an opportunity to reflect on themselves on a yearly basis. Heritage is very important because this is where we are grooming our people to understand [our cultural history]. By identifying young people and giving them a chance to study, we are creating a reservoir for the future.\nWe must also find a way of promoting all our languages. Some of them are seen as being inferior, which is a mistake. We also have to develop our unofficial languages, such as that of the amaPondo. When we develop them we are saying: \u2018We understand your culture, we know who you are and we want to see you prospering.\u2019 It is a huge task.\nI do not have a favourite because my point of view is that of an internationalist, where I listen to music from around Africa \u2013 Senegalese and Congolese music \u2013 and the world. I particularly enjoy jazz and soul. When I sit down to reflect and take stock I listen to jazz, and on a really bad day it is soul music. I like Richard Nwamba\u2019s African Connection [programme on SAfm]because it brings that music from across the continent. It\u2019s a pity that it is only once a week; I would like to have it during the week too.\nWe need to take better care of our artists. They entertain us and they become our celebrities, but in the end they die in very difficult circumstances. We need to improve their lives. They helped us to attain freedom and they are creating a new South Africa. Look at kwaito, which was an initiative of young people without anyone guiding them.\nDo the arts get enough financial support?\nI still have to see the fullness of the sector, but I would probably want arts to have more concentration in the sector. I am not sure it would only be financial. If you go to other countries, arts and culture are the things that unite people. They play a big role, like with sports and recreation.\nI am excited because of the potential that I feel we can unearth here. This is a junior department to others, but what can be more senior than leading a nation to identify itself? A nation that does not understand its soul is not worthy to be called a nation.\nAre there limits to freedom of expression? What about The Spear painting?\nOne area that we really fought for very hard is what is contained in the Bill of Rights: people have to express themselves. When you do that, you would be responsible and not express yourself to incite violence. When it comes to The Spear I can\u2019t say it is up to the minister to say what people must express. Whatever we do as a nascent demo-cracy, we must respect others.\nI\u2019m taking my point of view from the values of ubuntu, with the caring and sharing of Africans.\nBut other people have their own views.\nAre you going to any shows this weekend?\nI am going to the office as we speak for consultations, and I will still be doing that this weekend. Obviously I will be going to any events that I can, because you can\u2019t be something that you do not understand fully. It is one of the perks.\nWe have become a crass, materialistic society to the detriment of our most important needs \u2013 our spirits and our emotions. We cannot continue that way, because we are missing that sense of belonging."
