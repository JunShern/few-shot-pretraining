    "text": "With effect from 01 January 2018, HDB implements the streamlined resale transaction process with the introduction of the new HDB Resale Portal. The HDB Resale Portal has been launched via the HDB InfoWEB (www.hdb.gov.sg). Flat buyers and sellers have to login using their SingPass to access the portal.\ni. Sellers who wish to grant an Option to Purchase (OTP) from 1 January 2018 must use the new OTP form, which is available for download from the HDB InfoWEB (www.hdb.gov.sg).\nii. Sellers must register their Intent to Sell in the HDB Resale Portal at least 7 days before granting an OTP to the buyers. Buyers must register their Intent to Buy before the sellers grant them the OTP. Buyers who are eligible for and intend to obtain a housing loan from HDB must have a valid HDB Loan Eligibility Letter when the sellers grant them the OTP.\niii. The Resale Checklist for Sellers/Buyers e-Service has been discontinued from 1 January 2018. Sellers and buyers who have submitted a Resale Checklist on or before 31 December 2017, and the Resale Checklist is still valid, need not register the Intent to Sell or Intent to Buy in the HDB Resale Portal.\niv. The previous OTP form was valid until 31 December 2017. Resale applications with OTPs granted before 1 January 2018 using the previous OTP form will continue to be processed under the previous procedures, including attending a 1st Appointment at HDB Hub. Such resale applications must be submitted to HDB by 31 March 2018.\nv. Buyers who are granted an OTP on or before 31 December 2017 (using the previous OTP form) but have not submitted a Resale Checklist, must from 1 January 2018 register an Intent to Buy before exercising the Option to Purchase.\nvi. Salespersons can continue to submit resale applications for their clients via the e-Resale system or Estate Agent Toolkit (for agencies which are subscribers). They can also use the same facilities to submit their client\u2019s Valuation Request (for transactions under the previous OTP) and Request for Value (for transactions under the new OTP from 1 January 2018).\nvii. Under the streamlined process, a resale transaction takes about 8 weeks (from the date of HDB\u2019s acceptance of the resale application) to complete. To facilitate HDB\u2019s acceptance of the resale application, salespersons must ensure that their clients have all the relevant documents required to be attached with the resale application. For HDB\u2019s approval of the resale, it is necessary that their clients endorse all the documents and make the necessary payments according to the timeframe as requested by HDB.\nFor more information, please check out the \u201cFrequently Asked Questions\u201d on the HDB Resale Portal.\nCPF Circular Reference No. HBL/JL/2017/Circular issued by the Central Provident Fund Board (CPFB) on \u201cNew HDB resale portal- Request for Value\u201d on 20 December 2017. Please click here for the Circular.\nReal estate agents and salespersons who are appointed by HDB property owners in the resale of their residential premises are advised to take note and inform their clients of the new HDB valuation process and determining of CPF usage and Valuation Limit.\nIf you require further clarification pertaining to the above circular, please contact CPFB\u2019s Helpline at 6202 2052 or email Public-Housing-bankloan@cpf.gov.sg."
