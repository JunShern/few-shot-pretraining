    "text": "A recent survey has pointed to the increase in online shoppers using cryptocurrency for electronic payments, reporting growth of 700% since 2013.\nHowever, paying in this way still has problems which need to be addressed in the future. In the past, networks were trusted for zero-confirmations, but recent attacks against some of the coins have made vendors less enthusiastic. More coins are now available other than Bitcoin for these kinds of online payments with Bitcoin Cash (BCH) allowing SMS payments, and Verge (XVG) and ReddCoin (RDD) now offering small-scale payment options. Bitcoin\u2019s Lightning network still remains a fast way of settling purchases online.\nThe profusion of Bitcoin ATMs, often in the most unlikely locations around the world, continues to offer shoppers, who prefer a face to face \u201ctrawling\u201d the store option, the opportunity to instantly trade their BTC for cash. Recently New York, one of the world\u2019s major shopping venues has given crypto users the opportunity to purchase Bitcoin using a regular credit card at machines around the Big Apple.\nThe post 13% of Online Shoppers Going Crypto With 700% Growth since 2013 appeared first on BitcoinNews.com.\nThis entry was posted in allcoins, Altcoins, Big Apple, bitcoin, Bitcoin News, Bitcoin\u2019s Lightening network, Blockchain, BTC, Cryptocurrency, Kaspersky Labs, News, ReddCoin (RDD), Shopping online with crypto, Verge (XVG) on February 16, 2019 by adminbtc."
