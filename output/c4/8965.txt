    "text": "This brand new Airtel pack comes as rivals Jio and BSNL launched their IPL 2018-focused programsto assist users stream games online for the duration of the championship. While maybe not branded as an IPL 2018 special pack, the new recharge comes with higher daily information caps when compared with the other prepaid plans the company offers.\nThis sums to 164GB of 4G/ 3G information offered to consumers for the entire validity period, at a per GB cost of approximately Rs. 3. The bundled calls are limited to 300 minutes per day and 1,000 minutes a week, and are charged at 30 paisa per minute after that.\nIn comparison, Airtel Rs. 448 prepaid pack provides 1.4GB data every day for 82 days, amounting to 114.8GB data. In the same way, the Rs. 509 recharge offers 1.4GB data daily for 90 days, totalling 126GB of information. Other freebies are just like those of the Rs. 499 recharge.\nComing to the Jio Rs. 251 IPL package, users receive 2GB information every day for 51 days, 104GB data for the entire validity period. Though encouraged as an IPL program, users are free to use it to absorb content of any sort for the duration of the championship.\nThe BSNL Rs. 248 pack offers even more data each day with its 3GB daily information allocation. With validity of 51 days, this prepaid recharge provides a complete of 153GB. Users can only purchase this package by April 30, even though IPL 2018 continues for nearly a month more. But, unlike Jio and Airtel, the BSNL network is largely stuck on 3G speeds, and just Kerala circle subscribers get 4G speeds."
