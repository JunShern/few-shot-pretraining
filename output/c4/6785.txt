    "text": "What is a telepresence room? Telepresence Rooms are created by installing one or more monitors, plus a camera, microphones, and speakers into a room which will provide the illusion that a virtual or remote conference is taking place in the same room.\nA telepresence room can even include custom installation of lighting to further create the effect that both conferencing partners are in the same room. Imagine looking at the opposite side of the room from you, but instead of that side being physically in front of you, it is replicated using tv screens (similar to having a mirror on your wall, which creates an appearance that the room is larger, but this 'mirror' is actually a screen which shows a room in another office, acheiving the effect of a larger room in an even more powerful manner).\nThis type of room allows for businesses of any size to conduct remote conferences and save time on travel. One party enters their telepresence room and waits for the other party to enter their own. A typical setup involves the camera showing half of a table or desk on the screen (while the other 'half' is at your physical location), creating the illusion that you are sharing the same desk or table as the remote party. Hence, a virtual room, more commonly known now as a \"telepresence room.\"\nTelepresence rooms can come in various sizes, everything to multiple screen layouts to to single screen layouts more for executive to executive meetings (think \"Skype with Jumbo Screens\" for a more personal effect) so you can easily see facial expressions and utilize body language. A much better way to keep staff and executives engaged.\nAnother aspect typical of telepresence rooms are screens which can display what a member of the meeting is drawing or writing, so that all members (both at your physical location, and at the remote location) can easily see. This is achieved by an overhead camera which can zoom in on your work and display it for the other users.\nA telepresence room can be used by lecturers, professors, professional trainers, and others by providing them with a remote presence (a telepresence), thereby providing them a more dynamic and powerful performance since the audience feels more engaged with the speaker, who seems to be physically \"there.\""
