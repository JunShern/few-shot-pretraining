    "text": "Congratulations and thanks to Maen for his hard work over the past year. The fruit of his labor (his original manuscript) is now in press at Journal of Biological Chemistry. Which no matter how you slice it, is a pretty good journal. The manuscript describes the results from heroic numbers of biochemical experiments, purifications and assays to show that a 'calcium sensor' molecule called calmodulin binds to the cardiac sodium channel. This feat is all the more impressive when one considers that Maen along with the Van Petegem crew started the project by setting up the biochemistry in the newly founded lab. Thanks to Dr. Van Petegem for the expert assistance, advice and encouragement. Here's to many, many more.\nProst! Go Maen & The Ahern Lab!"
