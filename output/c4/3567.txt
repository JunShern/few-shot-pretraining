I cant even say who will be nominated besides Colman. Not that everyone else is not deserving, it just seems like The Favorite is a film the Academy will go for.\nA question mark for me is Emily Blunt. I just feel so bad for her that she has never been nominated; I am hoping that she\u2019s great as Mary Poppins.\nMelissa McCarthy \u2013 Can You\u2026?\nI bet if some of those Masterpiece Theatre productions were feature films eligible for Oscars, many of them would do well with certain members of the Academy. Hell, The King\u2019s Speech wasn\u2019t as good as some of those productions and it won Best Picture.\nClose has yet to miss a precursor for a nod. She\u2019s a freaking lock."
