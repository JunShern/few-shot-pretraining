This is the second day in two weeks that I haven't woken up with a headache and how incredibly fortunate for me two set of blisters have popped up on my lips over the weekend - which means things really aren't right. How cute. One on top and one on bottom.\nIt's embarrassing that I wear my stress on the outside like this.\nI'd like to think that I appear to be put somewhat together, but unfortunately I live with the curse of stress induced cold sores so my smile has a hard time hiding my frazzled mind.\nSome of the biggest moments of my life are marked with them. I can't exactly remember how many grade school photos they've ruined; second grade was particularly bad. I do remember that one time in high school I had (count them) five! One was even in my nose.\nAnother - A souvenir from my honeymoon.\nNext - A gift postpartum.\nNow - A reminder that I am trying to make it through my last semester of nursing school.\n8 more weeks. It's really so close that I can taste it.\nMaybe then I can get myself put back together.\nLabels: a little embarrasing, call me betty, i hate to admit it, reasons to call my mother, seriously?\nI somehow came across your blog and I think you have an adorable family! We haven't even met, but maybe one day since our husbands are cousins (on the Brown side).\nHad to leave a comment to thank you for sharing the naan and masala recipes!!! Made it for dinner last night and we both loved it. It's my new favorite meal.\nThank you Amber! I so look forward to meeting you as well sometime!\nSorry things are so frazzling right now. You will make it through though... you're tough like that.\nhang in there. hope tonight went okay."
