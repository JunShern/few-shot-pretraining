    "text": "UK PM May faces heavy pressure to step down to save Brexit by GREGORY KATZ The Associated Press | March 25, 2019 at 4:00 a.m.\nThe Associated Press MEDIA CONFERENCE: British Prime Minister Theresa May leaves after addressing a media conference at an EU summit in Brussels, Friday. Worn down by three years of indecision in London, EU leaders on Thursday were grudgingly leaning toward giving the U.K. more time to ease itself out of the block.\nLONDON -- Embattled Prime Minister Theresa May was scrambling Sunday to win over adversaries to her Brexit withdrawal plan as key Cabinet ministers denied media reports that they were plotting to oust her.\nThe confrontation may come to a head at a Cabinet session expected today.\nDespite headlines about a Cabinet coup, there was no indication from Downing Street on Sunday that a resignation was near. Two of the people mentioned as possible successors -- Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington and Treasury chief Philip Hammond -- expressed strong support for May."
