Stephen King is, obviously, one of the most-hyped authors of today, which is why the fall from so high can be so hard for his readers. This collection of previously published works, in itself, had a range like open arms \u2013 from eye-roll-warranting clunkers that never took off and seemed rather (dare I say it?) juvenile for such a master wordsmith to others that truly took my breath away and really explored the mental and emotional crevices of humanity in a way that was breathtakingly clear and surprising \u2013 similar to reaching the summit of a huge roller coaster and seeing the landscape around you for those vivid two seconds before being dragged back down again. Billy Blockade, Bad Little Kid and Under the Weather, I\u2019m looking at you now. Overall, I will remember this collection as a hodgepodge that had some really great highlights \u2013 and those highlights are what I will take from it. The short introductions to each story were a real treat. Those anecdotes and revelations were the extra seasoning that this collection needed to thread it all together. However, it would\u2019ve been cool if the original place of publication had been added to those intro snippets; after all, we all knew that most of them were previously published anyway.\nThis story was surprisingly and glaringly amateur. I appreciate that he led us into that with the knowledge that it was one of his earliest works, but it left an awful taste in my mouth and a hesitation to continue on with the collection. Not the best choice for starting out; better to bury that one somewhere in the middle. No stars.\nI\u2019m all for contemporary poetry that doesn\u2019t follow the rules, but the two poetry selections presented here proved that I am not a fan of King\u2019s attempts at that particular form of art. Disjointed and confusing, this one gets no stars.\nNo comment is comment enough. Not a fan of Uncle Stevie\u2019s poetry in this collection.\nUmm, not a winner for me. This was like R.L. Stine\u2019s Goosebumps on steroids (mild steroids that made it appropriate for an adult, not extreme steroids that made it King-like). Enough said. ** 2 stars for the humor added by the nurse\u2019s thoughts and the dynamic between she and her boss.\nSure, what better way to end the collection than with the apocalypse, I agree. This, however, showed again how King didn\u2019t jump in to tackle the big action scenes but settled for examining the aftermath, or 3rd person removed version of them. Other than that, it was a solid story, worthy of the King brand, with an ending that was foreshadowed but\u2026comme si comme \u00e7a."
