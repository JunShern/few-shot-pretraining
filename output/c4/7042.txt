But sometimes do you find it too plain or casual?\nWell, one way to dress up a plain white t-shirt is to throw in a blazer or pair it with tailored pants. There are a lot of ways to dress up this classic piece. But what if you just don\u2019t want to think of your pairings but still want a trusty white shirt?\nPieces like this are dressy as it is so there\u2019s no need to put an effort on what to pair it with. I\u2019ve been stuffing my closet with this kind of tops, in case you haven\u2019t noticed. Hehe!\nI even paired it with kicks and I think it still does not look too casual, right?\nSo, what do you think? Would you wear this?"
