    "text": "Gin Rummy is one of the traditional kitchen table card games that almost everyone learns as a child.\nLike many popular games, Gin Rummy is easy to learn, but mastering it requires serious effort. Unlike a lot of card games, strategy plays a major role in the results of a Gin Match.\nKnock Early \u2013 Whether you\u2019re playing standard Gin, or Oklahoma Gin, if you have the chance to knock early in the hand, do this. You won\u2019t earn a 25 point bonus for knocking how you would for going Gin, but you\u2019ll earn points for the extra deadwood in your opponents hand plus the line score.\nThat line rating can sure help when the match is over.\nYou can work towards an early knock by dividing your hand into three melds. Two of those melds will need to be runs or sets, and one meld is only a collection of low cards that total less than the knock number.\nThe longer your opponent has to make melds, the less of a chance that you may grab him with more deadwood in his hand than you have in yours.\nDon\u2019t Speculate \u2013 Every time you take an exposed card from the discard pile, you give your competitor information about your hand. As an example, if you choose the seven of hearts from the heap, your opponent knows that you\u2019ve either got running hearts or are amassing sevens. They will use that information during the remainder of the hand.\nBy speculating, you\u2019re giving away information about cards you have in mind which are not even melded. This makes his defense plays much more effective because not only is your opponent not going to play into your melds, he can keep you from even making one. And, those unmelded cards will stay as deadwood in your hand and count against you at the showdown.\nPromotion \u2013 One common play in Gin Rummy is to throw a card of a position in hopes that your opponent will throw one of the same rank. For instance, you want the six of diamonds to create a diamond run. By throwing the six of clubs, you advertise to your opponent that you\u2019re not collecting sixes, making him more likely to feel safe about throwing the six of diamonds.\nPay attention to whether of not your opponent advertises for cards. Also pay attention to if they fall to your advertisements.\nGin Rummy is a simple game which has many layers of plan. These basic strategies are simply the start tools you can use in the Gin table."
