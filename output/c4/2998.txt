I actually willingly switched to Win 8 back when it first came out and always preferred it to Win 7, too. Whenever I have to use a machine with 7 it feels slightly less responsive overall, but maybe it's my imagination.\nActually some pretty cool tech here.\nJust got an Amazon Fire Stick (yey for watching Netflix without my PS4 sounding like a small plane). Any other apps that are necessary or can someone point me to the discussion if it's happened before?\nYeah I read about not having YouTube unless it's on the browser but they do have an app now that comes up when you access through Silk. Was going to got the 4K for for \u00a339.99 which was a good deal. Going to the stick of my parents because they want to be able to watch Netflix and Prime. Looks be you get what you pay for.\nmercury and Jason Tate like this.\nmercury and David Parke like this.\nWhy do companies do this? Do they just get too big and have design teams that need to justify their existence?\nstars143 and mercury like this.\nNew Samsung foldable phone and four Galaxy S10 models revealed today. Rad.\nthe screen when it's folded is super tiny - you're gonna be using it open the majority of the time.\nFolded phones are a solution in search of a problem.\nYeah I cant see it being practical today and is more of a gimmick (those bezels when folded are hideous) but I just love to see new innovations and tech companies thinking outside of the box. In the future, if that folded screen could have a larger display, I could see it being a great solution to those people who have a phone and separate tablet. Other companies have tried this, but Samsung seems to currently have the best implementation of it by far.\nThose new S10 models are rad though. 5 freaking camera on the plus model and the ultrasonic in-display finger reader seems to be pretty quick and responsive. Really cool that it works with the display turned off.\nI do think a more practical version of the foldable phone would be if a company wanted to bring back the flip phone vibe. Imagine the nostalgia of an old Razr flip phone that turns into a full-screen smart phone when opened.\nSo rather than turning into a tablet, you unfold vertically, saving you space in your pocket and protecting your screen from a drop.\nyou should see a shower of moons fall down with a notification \"dark mode unlocked\". works on both iOS and Android. (sometimes you have to tap the emoji for it to trigger.\nIt's G O R G E O U S. True dark mode, like proper black.\nMy Samsung Galaxy S8 broke on Thursday night however was due an upgrade. I bought the Note 9 and, although it's a much larger phone, I will stand by the pen and the specs. Such a beautiful display with so many options. Glad I took the leap and got it in purple, too.\nNow I just need to download my apps again.\nI hope people are coming to the realization today that they don\u2019t need Facebook or Instagram to survive."
