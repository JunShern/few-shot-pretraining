This week get got some details of some of the new improvements and changes via the latest copy of Game Informer.\n-Bearded drawf guy is Salvador, the Gunzerker. Special ability is Dual-wielding. Any weapon can be dual-wield.\n-The original Vault Hunters will be support NPC\u2019s.\n-Bandits now have their own brand of weaponry.\n-Weapons can have custom decals and enhancements.\n-Enemies are more responsive, and actually interact with each other better.\n-The players will also have interacting dialogues, similar to those in Left 4 Dead.\n-BL2\u2019s skill tree will maintain the 3 Branch system and have more defined abilities rather than simple stat boosts. It is unknown how many skills will occupy each branch.\n-2 Gunzerker Skills were mentioned. One, increases the fire rate of any weapon the longer the trigger is held down. A second, while Dual-wielding, increases accuracy with same class weapons, or doubles damage for different class weapons.\nThat\u2019s a whole lot of awesome right there."
