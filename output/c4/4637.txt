The revolutionary Beppe Grillo, a comedian and convicted murderer gained considerable political power in their last election.\nHere\u2019s a video of Beppe with English subtitles. Note the body language similarities with another demagogue, Adolph Hitler.\nHe\u2019ll be lucky if a \u2018fatal accident\u2019 doesn\u2019t befall him.\nExpect to see more as the economic pain increases.\nThis entry was posted in News & Views and tagged austerity, Beppe Grillo, demogogues, Italy. Bookmark the permalink.\nI hate to agree with you but you\u2019re right, dammit. Politics has always been down and dirty but it seems to have degenerated to the point where no good people are willing to sacrifice themselves for the good of all. Perhaps they realize we\u2019re beyond the point of no return so all efforts would be futile. Hope I\u2019m wrong.\nI can\u2019t say I\u2019ve done a lot of reading on Hitler or picked up a copy of Mein Kampf, but I can\u2019t help but think most of Hitler\u2019s actions were to make the German people feel scared and to give more power to him and the government \u2013 seems like the opposite of what Grillo is trying to do.\nBeppo\u2019s similarities with Hitler are two-fold: his demagoguery in telling people what they want to hear and his theatrical body language.\nMost politicians are demagogic so there\u2019s nothing compelling there. His theatrics are comical but then he\u2019s a comic turned politician so that too is hardly compelling. Beppo\u2019s politics are completely different than Hitler\u2019s and I didn\u2019t mean to imply any similarities.\nHowever, the danger is our tendency to choose demagogic leaders as times get tougher. The demagogues aren\u2019t usually the ones to lead us out of trouble; they usually set one group against another and fail to address the real issues.\nThanks for the interesting links. I can get the imbedded YouTube link to work but I\u2019m at a loss why the screen doesn\u2019t display."
