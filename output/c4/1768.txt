    "text": "I am a US Prime member and the price you see may vary.\nHad to go with Hot Bread Kitchen.\nThat, and Rosa's Thai Cafe. The explanation of ingredients alone is worth $0.99.\nThere are a lot of positive reviews for this book.\nUse the \"Look Inside\" feature to see the list of recipes.\n@Toliver Thank you. As a newcomer to baking with sourdough I was happy to pick up the Sourdough book.\nI adore a sourdough with a nice tang to it. I can't read the bread threads on eGullet and view all of the pictures without drooling. It's almost Pavlovian.\nI don't bake but look forward to it when I retire. I am learning from your efforts. Keep posting!\nUse the \"Look Inside\" feature and scroll down to see a list of recipes (by holidays/events, etc) and scroll further down to see some recipes. Amazon's info page for this cookbook seems to show an oddly spaced list of recipes from the cookbook.\nThere's supposed to be a 30-minute DVD included giving additional guidance. Not sure how that is being handled by Kindle. It may be part of the download which is indicated on the Amazon info page that it may take longer to download due to file size.\nRecipes come with lessons about the history of the cookies.\nThere's a recipe for \"Maple-Roasted Carrot Salad\" on this cookbook's Amazon info page.\nThanks. I missed crust. I now have it.\nRecipes sorted by seasons. No listing but if you use the \"Look Inside\" feature and scroll down, you can see some of the recipes.\nI bought Sides. It's not clear how to navigate it as a cookbook. There's no list of recipes (even un-linked). The index, which runs 23 pages in the print book, is not reproduced in the kindle version. It wouldn't be too difficult to include it as a \"list of searchable terms,\" if not as links.\n**NOTE that this book has not been reviewed yet on Amazon."
