This determines your Soul Gifts - things that come naturally to you. They are the seeds of your abundance in your life.\nYour Soul Group of Origination and how does it affect your character and behaviour.\nHow this Soul is known and loved in Akashic Records.\nThe main life lesson / theme at present.\nMarriage is one of the most important events in a person's life because it is supposed to last a lifetime.\nwhether there are any negative ancestral karma, curses, etc.\nFor example, negative-soul individuals may not look like negative people, they may be successful, attractive and intelligent. Their negativity is hidden deep within. However, such individuals tend to create chaos and disruption in their environment and steal people's energy. Normally, such people are beyond 'rectification'.\nNegative ancestral karma normally manifests as genetic disorders that may negatively affect the offspring.\npercentage of expression of certain qualities that are important for a harmonious relationship.\nYou will discover how many lifetimes you shared together, if any.\nYou will also discover blocks and restrictions of each partner.\nYou will get the answers to questions concerning your relationship, e.g.\n- your personal questions about the current status of the relationship.\nDuring the reading process, clearing of all uncovered blocks and restrictions will be done.\nI use energy sensing, clairvoyance, intuition and access to the Akashic Records to receive the information about the condition of your energy body.\nI will scan your aura, chakras and the energy condition of the major internal organs.\nI will submit the short report in writing.\nThe report will include my general observations regarding the strength and the health of your aura and the energy body.\nIn this reading, I will answer one question about the relationship. E.g. \"Why did my mother behave this way with me?\", \"What was the nature of the troubled relationship between me and my ex, from a spiritual point of view?\", \"Should I try to resurrect the relationship?\"\nI will check the soul profile and some other parameters for you and the other person. I will write a minimum half-page description of this relationship.\nAt the end of the reading, I will do a short clearing.\nAkashic Records reading is delivered in writing. I will need 2-3 days to complete the reading.\nEnergy healing support in physical ailments.\nEnergy healing support in psychological conditions.\nDistant energy healing support for patients in ICU.\nPreventive energy healing, chakras and aura balancing.\nEnergy blocks removal for relationships, prosperity, careers, studies, for better focus, clarity, thought processes, etc.) Removal of obstacles in life.\nI do manifestation blocks removal. It is intensive and if helped by person getting healed in terms of wholesome character development, it is permanent. Else it will need healing every 4 months or so. Fee USD 90/ removal session.\nEveryone has an inherent ability to manifest one's wholesome dreams and desires but everyone is unable to do so all the time. Why? This is because one's energy system prevents one to empower one's wholesome dreams and desires. This is a technique in which I share simple, individualised method/s for one to practise in order to overcome the shortcomings of one's energy system allowing the person to achieve the desired results. Fee: USD 300/-. 50% advance and balance midway.\nOften, in a relationship, a person/s involved are propelled by certain characteristics that are detrimental for a relationship to flourish. This is because certain energies are dominating in them forcing them to act in an unwanted way. Correcting these brings a change in the attitude leading gradually to a change in the relationship. This is a process and may need several healing sessions to begin to manifest and consolidate. Fee: USD 50 /session.\nI am a psychic and an energy healer. You can find more information about me on this page.\nI am a Lightworker. Whatever I do is fully aligned to Light.\nI practice my own healing system which I call Pranatherapy. It combines the techniques of bio-energy healing, spiritual healing, psychic healing, entity removement, Project Sanctuary work, and pranic healing.\nAkashic Records access can be used for House or Property reading and clearing.\nCompatibility of the house / property with its occupants.\nThe energetic character of the property.\nA presence of the Sick Building Syndrom, if any.\nHow many Guardian Angels the house has.\nNegative imprints and negative programs.\nHistorical land usage that is not suitable for residential purposes.\nA presence of negative objects.\nAfter the reading is completed, I will clear the uncovered spirits, negative interferences, etc.\nIf you\u2019re interested in working more closely with your Spiritual Guides, I can offer you a reading where we dive into who they are, and what messages they have for you.\nIt is a form of Akashic Records reading work.\nHow many guides you have in the Inner Circle (Normally, each person has 4 to 7 guides).\nA message from your guide.\nThis is a distance session.\n1. Day 1 - Psychic clearing of negativities. You will receive a brief (a half-page) written report on the status of your energy field.\n2. Day 2 - A bioenergy aura clearing and realignment.\nIn my experience, this combination gives the best results. After clearing the negatives, the energy body is left damaged, hence a bioenergy healing session is needed in order to cleanse, heal, energise, realign and protect the aura for a faster normalisation.\nClearing and realignment sessions are done normally over two days.\n- to clear blocks and restrictions from the Incarnated Soul to the extent it is possible at the point of time.\nNegative energies, negative thoughts and emotions.\nTraumatic energies lodged in the subtle bodies.\nRedundant past life and this life contracts, vows and promises.\nBlack magic energies, curses, evil eye, etc.\nNegative programs blocking your flow of abundance, good health and harmonious relationships.\nThis is a gentle and safe technique. I access Akashic Records of the Soul and then I work with the energies of Light to create a positive shift in energies.\nAfter the clearing, the Incarnated Soul is realigned to the Divine Light, Love and Power.\nPsychic reading helps us to analyse possible ways of development of a situation.\nDuring a psychic reading session, I connect to the Universal Mind and your Spiritual Support Team to receive information.\nWe all have our spiritual support team who are ready to help us with advice or action - if we ask them. They will not interfere with our choices because of the Law of Free Will. So psychic reading findings will be just recommendations, there will be no 'shoulds'.\nThe Soul wants the Personality to make its own choices in order to learn and grow spiritually. However, it's always good to have some guidance on the subject from a broader perspective and a higher point of view.\nSome people request a reading about their loved ones who have passed away, to get answers to the questions that have been left unanswered.\n1. The answers to your questions regarding the departed soul or the situation connected to that person.\n2. How this soul is known and loved in the Akashic Records.\n3. A message from the person (departed soul) (if possible).\n4. A message from the person's Higher Self or his/her Spirit Guides (if possible).\nThis service is provided by Yulia Pal. It is an add-on to Soul Profile Reading and Clearing.\nThe reader will access your Soul\u2019s Manifesting Blueprint, which is contained in your 7th-dimensional aspect.\nwhich of your current actions are out of alignment.\nThe process of successful manifestation of your intentions in the physical reality has at least six factors.\nIf your current actions do not bring the desired result, you need to find out where you have blocked the process of manifestation.\nI need 4-6 days to prepare the Blueprint. We will then have a 30-60 min session, in person or over the phone, to discuss several different ways that your Soul is designed to manifest. Will discuss the blockages on the Soul and personality levels.\nYou will get your Blueprint description in a soft-copy format.\nOverseas (full form) USD 100.\nthe current place of residence.\nThis information is kept in confidentiality, and it will be deleted after the Akashic Records services have been provided.\nI will revert with confirmation within 24 hours. The seats are limited in a month."
