    "text": "An electrician\u2019s job requires adaptability and flexibility. There is a lot of climbing and maintaining awkward positions, while fixing the faults or implementing new installations.\nIf you are an electrician, you know what I am talking about. The adaptability and flexibility can be achieved by utilizing a good pair of electrician boots.\nWith so many options in the market to pick from, getting your pair of electrician boots right can be a difficult task. But picking a wrong option can make your job very uncomfortable and inconvenient.\nGood news is that I have done a fair share of research and testing of the boots available in the market, and have reviewed the best options in the below sections.\nMy first pair of electrician shoes was a result of hasty decision making and no prior knowledge about the product. It is no surprise that it proved to be a poor pair and had me hating myself whenever I used it. Moving on from that time, I have learned a lot about how to judge electrical hazard shoes, the important properties that make or break the deal and the brands which can be relied upon with eyes closed.\nI have surveyed the market and hand-picked the most popular EH rated boots. Of course, I had to sort through quite a lot of pairs, before I ended up with a handful which had a sweet balance of comfort and execution. I discussed my results with the EH rated shoes sellers and vendors, asked them about their opinion and tried to find out anything else which I may have missed. I also researched online for customer feedback about the products and dropped any shoes that may have persistent problems or poor buyer satisfaction. After coming up with my final list, I asked some of the electricians to wear the pairs and give their opinion on the shoes. I am happy to say that they were satisfied with the performance of the pairs in my list.\nDurability: This is one of the most important factors in any professional working shoe and especially for electricians, since they work in various conditions (including extreme ones!). Therefore you want your shoes to be long lasting, especially if you are paying a good sum of money for them. A lot of testing had to be done to compare the durability of the shoes, as naturally all brands describe their shoes as being sturdy.\nProtection: Again, another one of the requirement for any electrician is that he is protected from electric shocks, heat and slipping. Therefore, any EH rated shoe should have be reliable and able to face the hazards of the job, which are very common in the everyday job of any electrician. For comparing the protection, I checked the EH rating of the different pairs and whether or not they come with protected toes. Generally, the EH rating should be high if you are working in an industrial environment, since they can tolerate very high amount of electricity without hurting you.\nConvenience And Comfort: Given the tough conditions you, as an electrician, may work in, the last thing you would want is your pair of shoes biting your feet or giving you itches. A quality pair of electrician boot will leave you in a good mood while you are working and improve your concentration on your job. So, in my list of recommended shoes, comfort will also be of utmost priority.\nIt is strongly recommended that any professional electrician should get a pair of high quality EH rated boots, like the ones we mention below. While they may be expensive, but truth to be told, they can end up saving you from injuries or worse.\nHowever, If you are mainly in residential settings you may not need a EH rated boot. EH rated boots tend to be more expensive then regular boots. Also most of the boots we reviewed also have some type of composite or steel toe.
