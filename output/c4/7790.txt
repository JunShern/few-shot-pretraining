    "text": "Last week, Israeli media were filled with pride and praise for Omer and Sela Nevo, two brothers and students from Tel Aviv University who won the World Universities Debating Championships in the English as Second Language category, held in Manila.\nSix months ago, the two won first place at the European championship held in Ireland. Also, this is the second time in the past three years that an Israeli team has won the world championship.\nIsraeli debate has an important goal: hasbara. There is one place in this world where students from the National Muslim University in Malaysia embrace Israelis after they clobber them, where Catholic students from Ireland (a particularly hostile country) stick a blue Star of David on their national flag, and Turks wave blue and white banners - and that is the debating stage.\nIsrael\u2019s debaters are the best ambassadors that the state can offer: they can convey a message, be persuasive, talk to an audience, function under pressure - and they are not understood to be \u201cagents\u201d of the state. You should have seen the compassion shown by Iraqi students to explanations by the Israeli delegation during the world competition, during Cast Lead, in order to understand what I\u2019m talking about.\nDespite this, most Israelis - including government offices and authorities - have not yet understood the meaning of that foreign word, and they are somewhat amused at the fact that we\u2019re learning and teaching how to argue. Initiatives of many debaters to help with Israeli hasbara, even on a volunteer basis, met with no response; even in educational institutions, the penny hasn\u2019t entirely dropped. The whole world is already in on the secret of debating, and sees Israel as an empire. It\u2019s time for us to wise up, too, and start using our excellent debaters for goals that are even more important than bringing in wholesale quantities of trophies.\nWhile debate ought to be about quick and critical thinking, the Cohen-Idov is eager for his charges to become \u2013 voluntarily \u2013 mouthpieces of state propaganda, even explaining away Israel\u2019s Gaza massacre (\u201cOperation Cast Lead\u201d) to Iraqis.\nThis eagerness to recruit students into state propaganda efforts fits into a broader context where the National Union of Israeli Students is involved in several state propaganda efforts including paying students for spreading Israel\u2019s message online, and subjecting students to compulsory Ministry of Hasbara training before sending them on foreign delegations.\nApparently, conquering the flag of \u201chostile\u201d Ireland is the next great victory.\nA debate they can't win.\nHappily, these students cannot win the argument about the occupation.\nRemember, an Irish shop assistant in a supermarket was the first to boycott South African produce, a selfless act to uphold basic human rights.\nIrelands new coalition includes the labour party. The Deputy Prime Minister (T\u00e1naiste) Eamon Gilmore is Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and has been a vocal critic of Israel's policies. The government also includes independent member Davis Norris who is regularly smeared by Israeli bloggers.\nUnfortunately, the EU is hampered by the collective position taken by Catherine (Baroness [hon.]) Ashton who seems to issue a lot of harshly worded statements not backed up by actions."
