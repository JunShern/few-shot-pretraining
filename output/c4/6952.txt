    "text": "Three posts ago I mentioned going to RedTail Golf Course to try out a handful of different hybrids as I had been strangely struggling with mine even though the hybrid used to be my go-to stick.\nDefinitely a steal of a deal and I\u2019m interested to see if this change makes a difference in my 200-230 yard game as well as potentially adds some confidence in short par 4 tee shots. I\u2019m not saying it will or won\u2019t help, but I\u2019m going to give it a shot and see what happens.\nTo pay for this stick, I sold some golf clubs for the first time ever. I posted one of my old Nike pro-combo iron sets (pw to 5-iron with Project X 6.0 shafts) on eBay and was interested in what they would go for. All in all, after eBay took it\u2019s cut, the irons sold for about $100, so it was a wash to trade the irons for the hybrid.\nI truly hope this doesn\u2019t spoil my potential relationship with Titleist. I love my Vokey Wedges and AP2 irons as well as 913 driver, just have been struggling with the new hybrid. I am sure there is a way to have it better fit my new swing and this is something I will talk with them about when I return to Oceanside in mid-January. I do, however, want to keep it real and talk about what I am doing and right now I am exploring the world of the hybrid. A club that I want to compare this Nike to is the Titleist 912U 2-iron. As soon as I find one of those I will do a full comparison of the two.\nOver the past few months I have been working with Axon Sports to assist in developing an entirely different approach to golf learning in a new golf training app. We are focussing on imagery, imagination and visualization within the golf swing and the first version of the app is finally in my hands. I will be testing it out and tweaking aspects of the user experience over the near future and am excited about this new tool. It should be a game-changer down the road when it has been fully developed and a way for anyone to optimize their 10,000 hours.\nTo do it right, these things take a lot of time. I will definitely be updating this process as it develops and will reveal aspects of the app when the time is right.\nOne Response to \"Hybrid update and a new golf app in development\"\nI was at red tail in October and tried some 912u clubs so I\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t try one when you tried the other hybrids. When I asked for it the called it a driving iron instead of a hybrid. I love them off the mat but wondered how they would work out of the rough so didn\u2019t get one. When you do get one I\u2019d be interested to hear how it performs on the course."
