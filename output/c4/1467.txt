It started on Saturday afternoon with a birthday lunch for my daughter and then we all headed back to my house for a scrapbook sleepover. What she didn't know, however, was that I had planned a Mother Blessing and a belly casting surprise for her and she was thrilled. It was such a moving Mother blessing and there wasn't a dry eye in the house. Once we were done we scrapped until 2 AM and got up and made omelets in a bag! They were so easy and delicious to make!! Go here for the recipe. After breakfast my daughter had her belly cast my both her grandmother and myself so that was truly a special moment.\nWe continued to scrap the day away until everyone went home exhausted but happy after spending time with a powerful circle of women!\n...I have found myself drawn (no pun intended) to the world of mixed media painting and I have a strong desire to keep creating them. I did this one for my girlfriend Teresa. It's kind of self portraits of us sipping on snagria and she really loves it!\nThis was not only a great day for the American people around the world, it was a great day for everyone. President Obama is such an elegant classy man in every way and my prayers are with him and his family that they are free from harm's way.\nI was also glad to hear that Ted Kennedy is OK and recovering from his seizure.\nYes, today was truly one great day!\nIt has been a dream of my daughter Deanne and mine to create and sell our products.\nWe are presently adding inventory everyday,which includes knitted, crocheted and sewn items as well as cards and folk art, so please click on the icon at the left and pop in to say hello!!\nI've been busy knitting these great mittens.

Made me feel great!\nLast year around this same time I was toying around with a word that I could focus on for 2008 and the word was 'Grace\" and I do believe that I tried to live my year full of grace. For this year my focus word is metamorphosis as I know that I am ready for a change within; a change that will help me be my truest self. To the left is a button where I plan to follow the amazing Milliande as she gives art journal prompts for every day of January. I'm looking forward to this year ahead full of so many wondrous possibilities. I hope you are living the best time of your life! I continue to thank you for all of your posts and comments!"
