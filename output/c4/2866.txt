    "text": "Jordan Flaherty is a journalist, an editor of Left Turn Magazine, and a staffer with the Louisiana Justice Institute. He was the first writer to bring the story of the Jena Six to a national audience and audiences around the world have seen the television reports he\u2019s produced for Al-Jazeera, TeleSur, GritTV, and Democracy Now.\nThis summer, Haymarket Books will release his new book, FLOODLINES: Stories of Community and Resistance from Katrina to the Jena Six, and this fall he will be touring with the Community and Resistance Tour. Contact him at neworleans@leftturn.org. For more information on the book and tour, please see floodlines.org.\nAngola 3 News: Can you please tell us about your upcoming book?\nJordan Flaherty: Floodlines is a firsthand account of community, culture, and resistance in New Orleans in the years before and after Katrina. The book weaves the interconnected stories of prisoners at Angola, Mardi Gras Indians, Arab and Latino immigrants, public housing residents, gay rappers, spoken word poets, victims of police brutality, out of town volunteers, and grassroots activists.\nFrom post-Katrina evacuee camps to organizing with the family members of the Jena Six, Floodlines is the real story behind the headlines. The protagonists of this book are the people who have led the fight to save New Orleans.\nA3N: What will it show readers about New Orleans and LA that they won\u2019t get from the corporate media?\nJF: If this city is going to recover, the first step is getting out the truth that New Orleans is not okay. Most of the country believes either that New Orleans has been rebuilt, or that, if not, it\u2019s because people here are lazy and/or corrupt and wasted the nation\u2019s generous assistance. But New Orleans is still a city in crisis. The oft-promised aid, whether from FEMA or various federal and private agencies, has not arrived. We don\u2019t need charity, but we do need the federal and corporate entities responsible for the devastation of New Orleans to be held accountable for supporting its rebuilding. I want the world to know that it\u2019s not too late to make a difference.\nThe other crucial element of this book is a tribute to grassroots resistance and culture in New Orleans. People like Sunni Patterson, Norris Henderson, Rosana Cruz, Sess 4-5, and the many other organizers and culture workers who have cultivated this steadfast resistance.\nA3N: What is one of your favorite stories from the book?\nJF: A central story I focus on is the case of the Jena Six, and the people\u2019s victory it represents. Our movements should be proud of what happened in Jena. We should claim it as a success. Fifty thousand people marched in Jena, in a mass movement led by the family members of these six kids who were facing life in prison for a school fight. These Jena families didn\u2019t have the corporate media behind them, they didn\u2019t have money or mainstream civil rights organizations supporting them. All of that came eventually. But for months, these families were on their own, and they kept struggling and fighting for justice against incredible odds.\nThe massive national support these courageous families brought together helped the students. All of them remained in school rather than going to prison \u2013 and they are all now either in college or on their way. Without the world watching, the DA and judge could have done whatever they wanted.\nJena was more than a historical moment. I think that the young people from around the US \u2013 and especially the south \u2013 who traveled to Jena for the mass protests, and who also organized in solidarity in their own community, will continue to lead exciting struggles. I think we will see a Jena Generation.\nA3N: You have written several articles focusing on the Angola 3. How do you think the story of the Angola 3 fits into the broader picture of injustice in Louisiana?\nJF: Every year, thousands of New Orleanians are shipped upstate (or upriver) to prisons like Angola and Elayn Hunt. In telling the story of New Orleans, it\u2019s important to tell the story of these institutions.\nThe United States has the largest incarcerated population of any nation on earth\u2014the people imprisoned here represent 25 percent of all prisoners around the world. Nationwide, more than seven million people are in U.S. jails, on probation, or on parole, and African Americans are incarcerated at nearly ten times the rate of whites. Our criminal justice system has become an insatiable machine\u2014even when crime rates go down, the prison population keeps rising.\nThe state of Louisiana has the highest rate of incarceration in the United States\u2014816 sentenced prisoners per 100,000 state residents. By comparison, Texas places a distant second with 694 per 100,000. African Americans make up 32 percent of Louisiana\u2019s population but they constitute 72 percent of the state\u2019s prison population.\nPrison makes us all less free\u2014by breaking up families and communities, by dehumanizing the imprisoned both during and after, by perpetuating a cycle of poverty, and by making all citizens complicit in the incarceration of their fellow human beings. Since so many New Orleanians live in prisons around the state, the stories from these prisons are also the stories of New Orleans itself. Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola, Orleans Parish Prison, and all the other prisons of this state are central to the narrative of New Orleans\u2019s poor and dispossessed.\nAngola or another \u201clifers\u2019 prison\u201d is frequently the final stop on an unjust journey that begins with children born into substandard health care and housing; then shuttled into a school system that treats them like criminals from a young age; then left with few job options in a tourism-based economy in which corporations such as those that own the city\u2019s hotels profit while the residents are left out; and finally entangled in a criminal justice system that treats them as guilty until proven innocent. This is the \u201ccradle-to-prison pipeline,\u201d and nowhere is it more entrenched than here in New Orleans.\nPerhaps the most dramatic example of the injustice perpetrated by this system is the case the Angola Three, locked in solitary confinement because of their political beliefs.\nLouisiana attorney general James \u201cBuddy\u201d Caldwell has said the case against the Angola Three is \u201cpersonal\u201d to him. These statements by Caldwell and Cain indicate that this kind of vigilante attitude not only pervades the DOC, but that the mindset, in fact, comes from the very top.\nA 2008 legal petition filed by Herman Wallace echoed Alexander\u2019s words. \u201cIf Guantanamo Bay has been a national embarrassment and symbol of the US government\u2019s relation to charges, trials and torture, then what is being done to the Angola Three\u2026 is what we are to expect if we fail to act quickly\u2026.The government tries out its torture techniques on prisoners in the US\u2014just far enough to see how society will react. It doesn\u2019t take long before they unleash their techniques on society as a whole.\u201d If we don\u2019t stand up against this abuse now, it will only spread, he argued. The vigilante violence enacted on the streets of New Orleans after Katrina\u2014condoned and carried out in part by the police\u2014is one example of the truth of Wallace\u2019s predictions.\nThe case of the Angola Three is truly an international issue, and Herman Wallace, Albert Woodfox and Robert King are an important part of the city\u2019s civil rights history. Among those who know this history, the Angola Three are an urgent and ongoing concern.\nJF: Those who have not experienced New Orleans have missed an incredible, glorious, vital city\u2014a place with an energy unlike anywhere else in the world, a majority\u2013African American city where resistance to white supremacy has cultivated and supported a generous, subversive, and unique culture of vivid beauty. From jazz, blues, and hip-hop to secondlines, Mardi Gras Indians, and jazz funerals, New Orleans is a place of art and music and food and liberation.\nNew Orleans is a city of slave revolts and uprisings. In 1811, the largest slave uprising in U.S. history was launched just upriver, as more than five hundred armed formerly enslaved fighters marched toward New Orleans, partially inspired by the Haitian revolution. As one historian described, \u201cThe leaders [of the revolt] were intent on creating an [enslaved persons] army, capturing the city of New Orleans, and seizing state power throughout the area.\u201d Although the revolt was defeated, it inspired more over the following years.\nIn 1892, Homer Plessy and the Citizens Committee planned the direct action that brought the first (unsuccessful) legal challenge to the doctrine of \"separate but equal\"\u2014the challenge that became the Supreme Court case of Plessy v. Ferguson. Plessy, part of a community of Creole Black intellectuals and community leaders, boarded an all-white railcar after notifying the railroad company and law enforcement in advance. While the action was ultimately unsuccessful, it was an important turning point in this long history of locally led resistance to racist laws.\nYou could say the spirit of the Panthers was born in Louisiana. The Deacons for Defense, an armed self-defense group formed in rural central Louisiana in 1964, inspired the Panthers and other radical groups. The Deacons went on to form twenty-one chapters in rural Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, continuing a legacy of defiance that inspired future generations. Several civil rights workers and future revolutionaries were born in this state, including Black Panther leader Geronimo Ji-Jaga, born in Morgan City, and founder Huey P. Newton, born in Monroe. Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin, also known as H. Rap Brown, former chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and later the justice minister of the Black Panther Party, was from Baton Rouge. Chicago Black Panther Fred Hampton\u2019s parents were also from Louisiana.\nSo there is an intense and terrible history of racism and white supremacy in New Orleans, but also an incredible history of resistance, and that is what I am trying to pay tribute to in Floodlines."
