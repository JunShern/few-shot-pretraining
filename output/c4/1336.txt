Inspired by grey architectural wonder of Somanathapura, I decided to use the picture that I photographed in different ways.\nPrint a huge poster of the photograph. Treat it as a wall paper and stick it directly to the wall as if to form a focal point. Frame it all around using a wooden or a metal frame. Identify the feel of the photograph and then choose the right textures, patterns and colours to create the desired ambience.\nGet the complete picture screen printed and treat it as a wall paper. Alternatively, get the picture printed on ceramic tiles and fix them to the wall.\nviewer's eyes and creates an interesting focal point.\nWOW!! this was such an eye candy. Wonderful ideas.\nMy love for Olioboard !!!\nHow I Surprised my Spouse !!!!!!\nMy Etsy Journey Part 8 - The world just got smaller.\nLife is Like That ! !\nJanmashtami celebration from around the world!\nNew Hand Painted & Hand Embroidered Cushions @ Shopo !!!"
