    "text": "Namibia - the country located in the South Western Corner of Africa between the Orange River in the South and the Kunene River in the North - is an arid, dry country and seems as if it is from another world. Yet it is fascinatingly inviting and easy to travel through this country. Namibia is the dream destination of every photographer, a country of stark contrasts with clear skies and near perfect colour various. It is a country where many guest never want to leave. For those who seek peace and quite, proximity to nature, overwhelming landscapes and seemingly endless horizons Namibia should be on top of the list of next holiday destinations.\nThis famous national park is surely one of the highlights of any Namibia tour. The park is setup around the Etosha Pan, a salt pan, which is approximately 5000 km\u00b2 in size. Animals profit from the salt and the water in this huge protected area. Etoshas wildlife boasts most of the animals commonly found in Africa. Except for Buffaloes, visitors can spot the remaining four members for the \"Big Five\", namely Elephants, Rhinos, Lions, and Leopards. Furthermore Etosha has large herds of antelope such as Springbok, Oryx, Wildebeest and Eland, which can been seen grazing on the open plain of the park. The park has a road network of approximately 700 km which connects the rest camps and the many waterpoints. Etosha is ideally suited to be explored with an own vehicle / rental car, giving ample opportunities to spot wildlife up close and in their natural habitat.\nThe sand dunes at Sossusvlei and Deadvlei are among the highes in the world, reaching up to 375 m. The Tsauchab River, which only carries water in good rainy seasons, ends it's course in the dune belt between the Atlantic Ocean and the central highlands of Nambia. Here, amongst the impressive sand dunes, the course of the water has formed a pan of clay, which, together with the acacia trees creates one of the most scenic places in Namibia and a definite \"must-see\" for each visitor to Namibia. The empty, seemingly endless desert landscape, the mix of colours of grass, sand dunes, blue sky and mountain ranges in the backdrop together with the free roaming antelopes and ostriches are the reason why this area surely is one of the highlights of Namibia and the whole of Southern Africa.\nCurrently being the only UNESCO World Heritage Site in Namibia, Twyfelfontein is a very special attraction in Namibia. \"Doubtful fountain\", that is wat the farmer once called his land, on which the sandstone hills are located, which were already regularly visited by the San people centuries ago and left countly rock engravings and paintings as reminder of their stay. Due to the dry climatic conditions of the area these rock paintings and engravings still today in such a condition that one could think that they were only done yesterday even though they are many centuries old. The sheer amount of paintings and engravings make Twyfelfontein one of the most interesting sites for prehistoric art in Southern Africa. Along a walking trail one can explore that rock paintings and engravings in their original location and knowledgable guide will explain the meanings thereof.\nSwakopmund, a small city on Namibias central coast is bordered by the cold waves of the Atlantic Ocean on the one side and the dry sand dunes of the Namib on the other side. Next to L\u00fcderitzbucht Swakopmund is one of the first settlements in Namibia during the colonial era and still today many buildings in the city and the still very German culture and atmoshere are reminders of that time. Due to the central location of the city, it is the ideal half-way stop for nearly every trip through Namibia.\nThe Waterberg Plateau is a flat-topped mountain formed from sand stone. Due to its special geological formation, the Waterberg boasts a tremendous variety of fauna and flora. In 1972 this area was proclaimed as a national park, mainly to protect endangered animal species such as the Black Rhino. Today visitors can join on guided excursions onto the plateau or enjoy the scenic beauty of the park while walking along its many trails. Due to its central location, the Waterberg is also an ideal stop-over point between Windhoek and the Etosha National Park or other destinations in the north of Namibia.\nThe second largest canyon in the world is equally impressive as the Grand Canyon even though its dimensions are not as vast. The Fish River Canyon is approximately 160 km long and its depth varies between 450 and 550m. Part of the canyon was created by tectonic plate movement, while the remainder of the gorge was carved into the dry landscape by the Fish River. According to legend, a dragon fled from hunters into the desert and left a track on the ground, which nowadays is the canyon. Spectacular views can be enjoyed from look-out points on the eastern side of the canyon. There are also walking trails along the edge and inside the canyon.\nThe Mudumu National Park is situated in the Caprivi Strip in the north of Namibia and is bordered by the Kwando River in the west. It covers an area of approximately 1000 km\u00b2 and has, for Namibia, unusual landscape: rivers, reed islands and flat areas without any natural elevation. Due to the rough sand roads the Park should only be explored by 4x4 or by boat. Lots of running water is hardly a phrase one would associate with Namibia, but Mudumu National Park certainly has plenty of it! This is mainly due to the Park sharing its western border with the Kwando River, with its tranquil lagoons, narrow flowing channels and stupendous riverine forests. The remainder of the 100,000ha Park is an impressive expanse of dense savannah and mopane woodland, home to small populations of hippo and Nile crocodile that inhabit the waterways. Mudumu is a place of predators, lion roam, leopard and hyena hunt at night and packs of African wild dogs are now raising litter in the park.\nKolmanskop is Namibia's most famous ghost town, and is situated in the Sperrgebiet, (forbidden territory) a few kilometers inland from the port of Luderitz. In 1908, the railway worker Zacharias Lewala found a sparkling stone amongst the sand he was shoveling away from the railway line, near Kolmanskop. His supervisor August Stauch, was convinced it was a diamond and when this was confirmed, the news spread like wildfire, sparking a huge, frantic diamond rush and causing fortune hunters to converge in droves on Kolmaskop. Unfortunately for Kolmanskop and its inhabitants, richer diamond deposits were discovered further south, and operations were moved to Oranjemund. Within a span of 40 years Kolmanskop lived, flourished and died. Today the ghost town's crumbling ruins bear little resemblance to its former glory. The stately homes have been nearly demolished by the wind, and are gradually becoming enveloped by encroaching sand dunes. In 1980, the mining company De Beers, restored a number of buildings, and established and interesting museum, which has now become a popular tourist attraction.\nNamibia is a destinations that can be visited through-out the year. Of course there are a few differences between winter, summer and rainy season, but each season offers something special to the visitor.\nJanuary - April: This is the rainy season in Namibia. Occasional rain showers occur mostly in the northern and eastern parts of the country, but it is very seldom that it rains for longer many days in a row. The best thing about the rainy season is that the whole country is green and in full bloom, creating some spectacular scenery especially in the desert regions in the west of the country.\nMay and June: the month of May is somewhat of a travel secret. It's the time after the rainy season, the country still is nice and green, but chances of rain are minimal. During the day it is still nice and warm and the nights cool down to not too cold temperatures. Another advantage is that during this time of year most accommodation establishments still have low season prices, making a holiday very affordable.\nJuly to October: This is the time of year which is described by most guide books as the best season to visit Namibia. This is true, if you wildlife and animals sightings are very high on your travel agenda. Due to the very dry climatic conditions animals need to get water from water points. This makes it very easy for visitors to the Etosha National Park to spot animals and experience them up close.\nNovember to December: These are the hottest and dryest months in the year. Due to this animal sightings are also mostly at waterpoints. Temperatures through-out the day can go well over 35\u00b0C, in the northern pars and the Namib regions temperatres above 40\u00b0C are also not uncommen.\nYour request has been sent to us and a tour specialist from our office will contact you shortly.\nOur office are not open during weekends and public holidays.
