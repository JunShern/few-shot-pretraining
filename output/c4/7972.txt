Most of it was so fawning that the U.S. media is probably getting jealous as hell of the foreign press cutting in to dance with their date.\nDoes it make you feel better that all these guys are thrilled about the outcome of the election? Before answering, remember, a turkey sees lots of smiling faces the day before Thanksgiving too \u2014 but even a turkey isn\u2019t dumb enough to feel good about it (unless it lives in Berkeley and subscribes to Sabah or The New York Times).\nWhen a terrorist expresses joy at George W. Bush\u2019s departure, it makes me want to pat him on the back. And by \u201chim\u201d I mean George W. Bush.\nObama\u2019s victory \u2014 as the first African-American elected president in U.S. history \u2014 is painted by American liberals as a way for the U.S. to finally gain respect in the eyes of other more \u201csocially advanced and progressive\u201d countries in Europe, Asia and the Middle East.\nHow many leaders of African descent has China had? Japan? Iran? Sweden? Russia? Italy? Germany? Latvia?\nAnd how many of these countries the American left is constantly blowing into the ear of in a desperate attempt to be felt up by a foreigner are places where women are stoned to death for the crime of being raped?"
