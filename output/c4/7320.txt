    "text": "So, here\u2019s some food for thought: seeing as how the sequel to Dead Island, Dead Island 2, is being developed by the studio behind Spec Ops: The Line, Yager Development, could next year\u2019s addition to the series be buttering you up to smack you down with emotional whiplash?\nWhen Dead Island 2 was announced at this year\u2019s E3 in Los Angeles, a cinematic trailer showed off the game as being a lot more light-hearted and vibrant compared to the gloomy and heart-panging cinematic for the first Dead Island game; I\u2019ve heard that some people consider this change in presentation to be more of an honest representation of what Dead Island 2 will be like.\nInasmuch as that particular revelation was a turning point in the character development of the three squad members that featured in the game (especially the squad leader), perhaps, for the sake of speculation, the same may sneak its way into Dead Island 2 as well.\nPsychologically, it could work: bring the player up to a high and then smack them down to a low; which particularly works--as I\u2019ve experienced--when a serious point is intended to be driven across.\nSo, how would such a thing be implemented into Dead Island 2? Well, it\u2019s the zombie apocalypse, and the fact that its an \u201capocalypse\u201d opens up roads for an emotional rollercoaster. Having said that, the seriousness could also be balanced along with the game\u2019s touted light-heartedness, possibly like how Full Metal Alchemist handles its humor and seriousness.\nSay, for example, because of its seemingly fun nature, all the characters to feature Dead Island 2 are bashing, shooting and slicing their way through the zombie horde, and fun times are being had, when towards the middle or the end of the game it\u2019s instigated that you\u2019ll have to kill off one of the characters you\u2019ve grown to be attached to as the game went on, or a situation arises when you\u2019ll have to make a choice of what to do in a given moment that could have noticeable repercussions, etc., etc.\nIt\u2019s all well and truly possible that Dead Island 2 might not even have an emotional trap at all. It could be just what its E3 trailer implies it to be: a vibrant adventure wherein a group of survivals go out into zombie horde to wreck some shiz, whilst possible picking up some survival essentials along the way.\nHowever, having said that, it wouldn\u2019t be that surprising--at least to me--if the studio does end up implementing something like that into the game. Then again, the studio is also co-developing Dreadnaught, which doesn\u2019t look like there\u2019ll be an emotional rollercoaster at all, so Dead Island 2 doesn\u2019t have to have any sort of rollercoaster at all--unless it\u2019s a fun one.\nWhat do you think? Would you want to experience an emotional whiplash when playing Dead Island 2? Let us know in the comments below. The game is currently slated to release in Spring, 2015 for PC, Xbox One and PlayStation 4."
