    "text": "Should Kids Lift Weights? By Brett Klika C.S.C.S.\nIn working with a large number of youth, this is one of the more common questions I get from concerned parents. Urban legends of stunted growth, fractured growth plates, and prematurely inflated physiques have made parents, and society for that matter, reticent to involve youth in weight training.\nThe fact is, there is no scientific evidence to suggest that there is a perfect chronological age to start weight training. Research has not demonstrated any negative health consequences for weight training in youth, assuming proper movement is introduced and enforced concurrently with appropriate progressive increases in training load.\nDespite what myths have been created around the subject, the current data suggests youth weight training injuries are primarily due to equipment accidents (weight falling on them, tripping in the weight room, etc.) or overzealous coaching rendering improper program introduction and progression.\nProper resistance training in youth has been demonstrated to improve fitness, favorably affect bone density, improve movement ability, and decrease the likelihood of athletic injury. Weight training is merely loaded movement. More simply put, it\u2019s challenged movement. If basic movement becomes easy, we can challenge by adding something extra to continue to provide a training effect.\nIf a child can do a squat pattern perfectly for repetitions, holding a 2- pound medicine ball adds additional load. Once they can overcome this load with proper movement, they can hold a 4- pound ball. All semantic hubbub aside, this is weight training. One doesn\u2019t have to be lifting barbells and dumbells to be training with weight. If a child can\u2019t do a squat pattern perfectly, adding additional load would make no sense. They have demonstrated they do not need any additional challenge. The movement pattern itself has provided enough load.\n1. Are they able to focus on the proper execution of task?\n2. Are they able to execute and repeat an unloaded task with proper movement and cadence?\n3. Are they mature and coordinated enough to respond to coaching cues?\n4. Are they interested in weight training?\n5. Is the person in charge of their program experienced and knowledgeable about movement and progression?\nIf the answer to any of the above is \u201cno\u201d it doesn\u2019t matter the age of the human, they are not ready for weight training. In this case, I would focus on merely learning how to move properly through a variety of movement patterns without additional challenge or load.\nThe best answer to \u201cWhen should my child begin lifting weights\u201d is \u201cwhen they need to.\u201d When a child is able to focus on an organized training in which they execute and repeat all of the involved skills and drills correctly, add a challenge and slowly progress over time.\nBrett Klika C.S.C.S., Director of Athletics at Fitness Quest 10 and founder of www.brettklika.com, is a world- renowned human performance specialist, motivational speaker, author, and educator.

It seems like there is always a new fitness trend promising quick and easy results. Do not fall for the marketing gimmicks! Stick to the fundamentals that have been proven to work.\nFor example, by exercising larger muscle groups you will burn more calories. Doing intervals is a great way to add intensity for even faster results. Walking each day is great exercise for both the mind and body.\nFinding time to exercise as a new mom can be tough! Your daily workouts can be included in the activities that you\u2019re already doing by learning exercises that include your baby.\nSquats are tough on your thighs, and soothing for your baby. They can be done as you hold him or her against your chest and benefit you both. Exercises like pushups, plank, cat-cow, and bird-dog can be performed with your baby is lying underneath while giving them kisses and smiles. It\u2019s a fun way to enjoy time together while also doing something good for you.\nInvest in inexpensive equipment for your home like a stability ball and resistance band. That way there is no excuse not workout when you can\u2019t get to the gym.\nBuild slowly back to your pre-pregnancy fitness routine. Do not simply jump right back in to what you were doing before.\nIt is necessary to repair the deeper ab muscles that have been stretched first. Do not start with crunches. You can begin to rehab your abs with deep breathing exercises, plank, bridge, and pelvic tilt.\nIf you were a runner then start with walking and jogging before returning to running. If you lifted heavy weights, start lighter and do high repetitions.\nSimply going back to your old routine will do your body a disservice if you end up injured and can\u2019t do anything at all.\nBe patient and nice to yourself. Don\u2019t compare your body or weight loss to celebrities. It is not fair to measure yourself next to someone who probably has a full-time trainer and chef, and whose profession possibly requires them to be a size 2.\nRemember that it took 9 months to put the weight on, and to drop it overnight is not healthy or realistic. Steady, consistent exercise and weight loss is the best way to decrease fat and keep it off permanently.\nDo them! I can\u2019t stress this enough. Keeping your pelvic muscles strong is often overlooked, but so important.\nTatum Rebelle is a pregnancy and new mom fitness and nutrition expert.
