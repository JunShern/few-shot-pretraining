    "text": "I\u2019m adding some middle-grade cover images to my portfolio (I\u2019m an illustrator) of stories that don\u2019t exist but that I wouldn\u2019t mind reading. I\u2019ve read stories about giants eating sheep, but I\u2019ve never read of a shepherd in those stories. Surely there must be at least one shepherd in all of those accounts who has suffered the indignity of his flock being eaten. After some day dreaming, I decided to do a picture of a shepherd boy awkwardly encountering a giant eating his flock.\nSam Smith saw an early digital sketch of this piece and emailed me an accompanying poem. I am happy to report that the giant isn\u2019t malicious. He just needs to get his snack on.\nHis name was Polonius Wheeler.\nHe sometimes became a sheep-stealer.\nAnd much to the shepherd\u2019s chagrin.\nThe poor, little lambs near to him.\nWith an appetite fixed upon lamb?\nOf berries, and jellies, and jam?\nSparing people, what else can he do?\nFor giants need some protein too.\nAnd let him eat cake without fuss.\nHe\u2019d sniff and come swiftly for us.\nI love this post! The poem is hilarious and the art is gorgeous (\u2018love the cool shade against the warm sun.) More, please!\nThis is pure gold, both the poem and the illustration.\nPoor misunderstood Polonius! Love this. For some reason it made me think of \u201cJethro and Joel Were a Troll,\u201d by Bill Peet. That giant preferred turnips. \ud83d\ude42 .\nPolonius hasn\u2019t developed a taste for human flesh \u2026 yet. I love Bill Peet, but a vegetarian giant stretches credulity:) or maybe that\u2019s just my animosity toward vegetables showing.\nTrue enough. Peet\u2019s one flaw is he has a tendency for vegetarian monsters \ud83d\ude42 . My husband was just lamenting the plight of giants; how DO they get enough to eat?\nI keep coming back to this page, and it makes me smile every time.\nSidenote \u2013 I was temporarily disappointed, because the title did make me hope that it would be an illustration and story of a sheep eating a giant. Maybe next time.\nBut this was so fun. My three-year-old says the giant should try cow meat\u2026 and lion meat.\nI also like the \u201cdrawing illustrations for a story I\u2019d like to read\u201d idea. Thank you!\nI understand your disappointment. Sheep will eat anything, and I have no doubt they would eat giant meat if it were available to them. There is something scandalous about the lack of stories featuring carnivore sheep. I love that your three-year-old transitioned from cow meat to lion meat. If anyone can eat lion meat, it\u2019d be a giant, right?\nThat is hilarious, Amy. I love everything about that comment.\nI thought it was going to be sheep eating a giant, too! My three-year-old son, though, for some reason is looking for a picture of a giant falling down in the snow. Maybe next time!\nIt needs a hyphen. Sheep-eating giant. Lynne Truss\u2019s \u201cEats, Shoots, and Leaves\u201d has a very memorable chapter on the subject of hyphens.\nI\u2019m so glad that I\u2019m not the only one who read this thinking, Sheep eating a giant? Terrific!\nI\u2019m glad you guys are enjoying it. I love the sketch. And I should say Zach\u2019s edits improved the pedestrian poem quite a bit. This is fun stuff.\nBrilliant \u2013 all the way round.\nOh Sam, this is awesomeI love the name Polonius and how the words to this poem jump and dance on my tongue as I read it aloud. Your children must be delighted to hear it!\nThanks so much, Brenda. I just read it to them and they laughed, but I hadn\u2019t realized till then that there are a lot of BIG words in it. Oh well, explanation is fun.\nI have given in to the pressure. Sheep-eating Giant it is.\nIt\u2019s weird that these are out of time-order, right?\nMorning after reading this to our 4 year old, \u201cI dreamed about giants eating me last night.\u201d A week after reading this to her, from her Sunday school teacher, \u201cEvelyn asks the most interesting questions. Last week she raised her hand to tell us all that she knows of a giant who eats whole people.\u201d I think she might have missed the message.\nWell, she\u2019s on the right track. See this space (SW) for more on giants and their ways."
