    "text": "An unavoidable part of the process of doing a project with vinyl and a vinyl cutter is WEEDING. If you are a beginner with your Cameo or Expression vinyl cutters, you might be like \u201cHow do I weed vinyl?\u201d or even \u201cDo I have to weed my vinyl?\u201d Answers to all your vinyl weeding questions below!\nWeeding is the process of removing all the extra vinyl from around the image you have cut before applying it to the finished project. A vinyl cutter cuts along the lines of the design, but it doesn\u2019t remove the extra vinyl. You need to do that as well as removing the little holes inside any designs or letters.\nWhether you are using heat transfer vinyl or adhesive vinyl, the process of weeding is pretty much the same. Here are some tricks I have picked up that make weeding so much easier.\nPrep your crafting area and have all the supplies (above) you need at arms reach. And don\u2019t forget about the light! It\u2019s all about the light. \ud83d\ude42 You also want to have very clean hands and skip the lotion\u2026oils from your hands can mess with the vinyl adhesives. Another reason to use the tools instead of your hands when possible.\nStart by removing the dots inside any letters and small internal areas of designs FIRST. If you remove these small, internal pieces first, you\u2019ll have fewer problems with your design sliding since it is braced by the outer part of the vinyl.\nExtra bits of vinyl sticking to the finished design. You will inevitably find a little dot of vinyl stuck somewhere it shouldn\u2019t be \u2013 perhaps punctuation that didn\u2019t adhere or the center or dot of another letter\u2026 This happens to me several times over the course of a typical vinyl weeding session. Take care of misplaced vinyl bits BEFORE you apply the vinyl design to the finished project. simply use your tweezers to remove the extra vinyl while holding the piece you want to keep in place with your other hand.\nPulling and Stretching/Design very difficult to weed. Also try to avoid pulling or stretching the vinyl to get it to come away from the outer piece. I promise at some point you will do this (we all have!) and you will be bummed that you have changed the shape of the piece. I\u2019ve just stuck my misshapen pieces of anyway, trying to get them back into shape as best I could.\nIf you are having a VERY hard time weeding, with excessive stretching and pulling of the vinyl, you may need to check your settings on your vinyl cutting machine and re-cut. Did you choose the correct material in your Silhouette or Cricut settings? The culprit could also be a dull or dirty blade. The occasional piece that needs an extra tug is normal, but if you are having that trouble with every piece\u2026that\u2019s NOT normal. Re-cut and start over! Check out this wonderful post on extending the life of your vinyl cutting blade from Leslie, The Seasoned Homemaker.\nI can\u2019t see the cuts! Make sure you are using bright enough light. If you are and you still can\u2019t see the cuts clearly, check your settings and your blade. If the machine wasn\u2019t able to cut all the way through consistently, you will need to fix the problem and cut out your design again.\nThe letter slid off\u2026what do I do now? Don\u2019t panic! This can happen especially with small letters and designs. If one of your letters or designs has gone sliding around, simply use the point of your hook to nudge it into place. If the letter has completely slid off, use your hook to gently grab it on the adhesive side or use your tweezers. Put it back in it\u2019s place like it never happened. \ud83d\ude42 Here are more great tips on weeding small designs and letters.\nNow that you are a total weeding expert, let\u2019s move on to the next lesson\u2026how to use transfer tape and apply your vinyl to the finished piece!"
