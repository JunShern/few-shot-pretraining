She recently launched an Etsy shop and she\u2019d love for you to pop over and browse around if you\u2019d like! The sushi stickers in some of my other pictures are from her as well.\nBring on the pens and pencils and markers!\nNo. 1\u2026\u2026.. I love my Zig Calligraphy markers.\nI have a metallic set and a set of primary colors.\nThey are double-tipped, which is the-next-best-thing-since-sliced-bread, naturally. \ud83d\ude09 I do love that they have a broader end and a smaller tip.\nNo. 2\u2026\u2026.. This Micron set of markers are a fine line set varying from .20mm to .50mm. They are great for calligraphy practice or addressing envelopes.\nI\u2019ve long loved my set of Prismacolor markers! They are double-tipped too, with a fine end and a broad end.\nWe were never fond of colored pencils until we found Prismacolor! They are the bomb! We ridded our home of all other colored pencils and haven\u2019t looked back. They aren\u2019t cheap, but they\u2019re worth it! My kiddos used them so much for school and coloring projects. I have some I use with my favorite coloring books.\nNo. 5 and 6\u2026\u2026.. Pens and Highlighters from The Daily Grace Co!\nI love these so much! They definitely are high on my list of favorites.\nI don\u2019t know how to explain the highlighter exactly. They are somewhat of a solid gel and they don\u2019t bleed through your page. They\u2019re awesome-possum and I love all the colors and the good word reminders on each one of who we are in Christ. I like to keep a few of these pens and highlighters around to use as gifts.\nYou can shop their pens and highlighters right here.\nIf you are seriously interested in purchasing pens from The Daily Grace Co, keep an eye out\u2026\u2026\u2026they run sales pretty often and generally offer free shipping with $60 orders. Oh, and they have Bible studies and journals and beautiful mugs along with their really awesome pens!\nThere\u2019s a new set of pens at the Daily Grace Co. right here that I think look really fun!\nI picked this set up on a whim several years and totally fell for them! They say ultra fine point on them. I\u2019ve loved them for lettering, used them in my Bible, and again, for addressing envelopes and cards!\nThis simple set are fine points and I\u2019ve used them a good bit in my Handlettering for Relaxation book.\nNo. 10\u2026\u2026. These Uniball markers I ordered from Amazon last year and promptly fell in love with them. Especially with the gold one!\nThey\u2019re a gel pen and I very much like the look of the lettering when using these. I haven\u2019t used the white one much and I forget that I have it, but it would be perfect for black paper and envelopes.\nIf you like reading and books and pens and journals, you might enjoy popping over to the Modern Mrs. Darcy\u2019s shop and checking out her accessory set. It includes a tin of book darts and a variety of her favorite pens!\nA Basket of Pens and Pencils and Markers, Oh My!\nHow fun! What a neat collection! I\u2019d love to see all your coloring books. I have several and I think they are fun. I think I counted ten the other day because I thought they might make a fun Ten on Tuesday post! \ud83d\ude42 Do you have a very favorite brand of pen or markers? Or do you use certain ones for certain things?\nHow fun that you have a hobby you and your daughter and granddaughter all love!\nHow super fun that you\u2019ve won giveaways for coloring books, pencils and markers! I\u2019ve entered some, but haven\u2019t won so far! I enjoy giveaways too! Both entering them and offering them here on my blog.\nI would love to see pics of your coloring books and I\u2019m going to check out some of the pen brands you mentioned. Thanks!!\nI like Sharpies too and they do have lots of fun colors!"
