These models together with microfinance are improving the lives of the 4 billion people living at the BOP. The last section covers in detail a remarkable example in this area, Scojo Foundation. Scojo is developing the market for affordable reading glasses at the BOP through microfranchising.The book provides the author\u2019s insights on 1) how the business (for-profit) and social (non-profit) worlds have been converging, setting the stage for these new models to emerge, 2) how these models, the people behind them, and the advent of Web 2.0, are creating a strong and positive movement towards a more responsible, sustainable and kinder world and 3) how all of us could make a difference.The book has been published in German language by rueffer and rub with the title >Kleiner Einsatz Grosse Wirkung.

(Edward Elgar Publishing). This edited volume comprising 13 chapters and 18 authors introduces the concept of microfranchising and discusses how this business model can be effectively used for poverty alleviation. Different models of microfranchising are reviewed and specific case studies are highlighted to show how it has worked and is working in different parts of the world. Also the advantages as well as potential problems and pitfalls of microfranchising are discussed. My contribution was on the subject of \u201cMicrofranchise Funding\u201d (Chapter 12).\nIf there is one thing I could hope for is that the price for this book would be a bit lower so more people can afford to buy it and read it.\nThis entry was posted in Books, empowering people, MicroFranchising, publications/presentations, social entrepreneurship on June 6, 2007 by microfinance.\nThe International Symposium \u201cRealizing Property Rights\u201d and the launch of the Swiss Human Rights Book will take place at the University of Zurich on June 23rd.
