In our office, you are not \u201cjust another number\u201d or \u201cjust another case\u201d, and we believe that you deserve something different.\nThis is why we provide you with a complimentary consultation , which is a conversation with the doctor designed to answer any questions you may have about your health concerns and our practice. Following the complimentary consultation, you will have the opportunity to schedule a comprehensive Tonal Chiropractic Examination either immediately afterwards, or at a later date of your choice. Unlike some other Chiropractic offices where the exam is just a formality, done in under 10 minutes, and often by someone other than the doctor, this thorough exam will be performed by one of our doctors to identify the presence and/or nature of your Tonal Shift(s) and your current state of health.\nAfter the examination, our doctors will create an individualized, comprehensive plan based on your/your child\u2019s objective clinical findings. These findings will be reviewed, in detail, at a patient recommendation conference (PRC), providing you with an opportunity to ask questions and understand more about your/your child\u2019s underlying condition. In addition to helping you feel better, it is our goal to help your body function at its optimum potential, allowing you to become the best version of yourself."
