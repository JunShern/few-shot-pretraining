    "text": "What does your bedroom look like? Is it a place where you enjoy spending time? A bedroom should be designed to suit your lifestyle, your tastes and your budget. This is a room where most people spend a lot of time and so it makes sense to invest in the design of it. If the look of your bedroom isn\u2019t meeting your expectations, then it may be time to rethink and redecorate.\nIt can sometimes be easy to neglect the bedroom when redecorating, particularly when sharing a house with other people; the rooms that are shared by everyone tend to take priority and the bedroom can often be left till last, if done at all. The areas of the house that are more \u2018public\u2019, such as the living room, kitchen and dining room will often be the more tempting choice when redecorating. But taking the time to consider the aesthetics of your bedroom and making the best out of the space available, will pay off in many ways. Having a space that is restful, stylish and organised, that you can call your own, will give you a sense of calm that you just can\u2019t achieve with a messy and unattractive room. Sleeping in a relaxing environment is so important, as poor sleeping conditions can lead to headaches, insomnia and other problems.\nSo perhaps you\u2019re ready to try out some exciting new decor theme or a piece of contemporary furniture, but you\u2019re on a tight budget. If this is the case, then consider redecorating the room gradually, over a long period of time. Small improvements and subtle new decorative additions will slowly enhance the appearance of the room, without costing you a small fortune. One point to remember is this; think about quality rather than quantity when it comes to furnishing your bedroom. One well designed piece of contemporary furniture, such as a four poster bed or a chic dressing table, would be a far better choice than several cheaper pieces that lack character and style. If you decide to splash out and purchase several new furniture items, then remember that they do not have to match, but there should still be a certain consistency in the overall look of the room. This might mean that you choose furniture whose colour tones are complementary to one another, or that all of the pieces you select have some style element which is similar.\nIf you are investing in quality contemporary furniture items, then consider selecting pieces that are relatively neutral in colour, as you are less likely to tire of these. Boldly coloured furniture may appeal to you now, but a few years down the line, it may not seem so attractive. Instead, those who want a striking colour in their bedroom should experiment with wall colours, as it is far easier and cheaper to replace a wall colour than to replace an expensive piece of furniture, should you get tired of the colour choice. Well made pieces of furniture are an investment to which you should give a great deal of thought, as well designed furniture items can last a lifetime."
