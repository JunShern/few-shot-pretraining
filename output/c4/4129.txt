    "text": "Our new Teaching and Learning Centre at Leeds Trinity University has been granted full planning permission.\nThe development, which will incorporate a 2000m\u00b2 learning resource centre within the University\u2019s existing Andrew Kean Learning Centre, will offer first class flexible and adaptable learning spaces for students of the Higher Education institution.\nWe\u2019ve created a technology-rich, dynamic environment that supports social learning by encouraging students to work in a collaborative and informal way. The design emerged via a series of formal and informal engagement sessions which had a strong emphasis on collaborative working, such as sharing images on Pinterest with the University\u2019s Estates team and consulting with the existing staff and students.\nThe project is due to start construction on site in May. This is one of several projects we are working on for Leeds Trinity University; other schemes include a new Student Accommodation block and the development of a full Estate Strategy."
