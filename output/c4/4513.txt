    "text": "The single, most overlooked factor in behavior issues in children.\nCell phone radiation is one of the hottest and most controversial health topics of 2012. But it\u2019s especially critical when it comes to regulating cellular technologies for pregnant women and children.\nSince the publication of Zapped, I have been following the ongoing effects of cell phone radiation and diligently searching for practical solutions for adults, teens, tweens, and children. So imagine my relief when I learned that Pong Research has smartphone and iPad cases which help to protect users from wireless radiation emissions without interfering with the device itself or its performance\u2014both proven in FCC-certified labs.\nPong\u2019s cell phone and iPad cases are just what I have been searching for.\nThe Pong research department has said that, \u201cAccording to the latest Pew Research Center\u2019s Internet & American Life Project, 83% of American adults own some kind of cell phone.\u201d And the Kaiser Family Foundation reports that 31% of 8-10 year olds own a cell phone, 69% of 11-14 year olds, and 85% of 15-18 year olds. In addition, Apple has already sold more than 11 million iPads and Gartner, one of the world\u2019s leading technology research firms, predicts that the iPad will continue to dominate tablets.\nWhile incriminating evidence starts to emerge, The World Health Organization has already declared cell phone radiation as a possible carcinogen\u2014in the same category as lead. A separate 2011 study published in the American Medical Journal discovered that 50 minutes of cell phone use triggers excessive brain activity in the area closest to the phone.\nLandmark research from the Journal of Epidemiology in July 2008 reported that children born to mothers who used cell phones while pregnant, and children who used cell phones by age seven, were 80 percent more likely to be hyperactive and to have emotional and behavioral problems.\nThis latest report calls for tougher standards to be put in place for regulation of cellular technologies\u2014particularly when it comes to children and pregnant women.\nI also discovered many additional studies linking other forms of technology to childhood behavioral issues, which I discuss in Zapped.\nI think of how rates of autism, ADHD, and learning disabilities have soared in the last forty years. In 1970, for example, about 1 in 10,000 children were diagnosed with autism. Today the incidence is estimated by the Centers for Disease Control at 1 in 110. There are many theories as to the rise in autism including the overuse of Doppler ultrasounds during pregnancy.\nLimiting exposure from cell phones and cordless phones by way of texting, enabling the speaker phone option, and simply turning the device off during non usage times are not always easy to implement. The FCC precautions against using products claiming that they block or shield cell phone radiation. In reality they have been found to result in an increase of radiation exposure to the user. These same devices also decrease the performance of the device which only compounds the problem.\nMy book, Zapped, lists 1,268 helpful ways to outsmart the hazards of electronic pollution aside from eliminating cell phone or iPad usage altogether.\nAvoid baby monitors with stubby half-inch antennas. Look for the older style that is a wired monitor.\nNever carry your baby while cooking, especially at the microwave.\nDiscourage a small child\u2019s use of a cell phone.\nNever phone or text while driving.\nNever attach a cell phone to your body or carry it in your pocket or bra.\nPong Research carries a high quality collection of cases for BlackBerry, iPad, iPhone and Android. They have been demonstrated by FCC-certified labs to reduce the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) up to 95% below the current FCC limit. The Pong technology uses a patented antenna that redistributes and redirects the offending radiation away from the user. These antennas are embedded in each case protecting the user\u2019s head and body.\nThey are available in a rainbow of colors and are as easy to put on and take off as any high-quality cell phone or iPad case. They have been designed and tested to work anywhere in the world. The iPad 3 \u201corigami\u201d case is especially nifty\u2014it can be folded into five different vertical or horizontal positions designed for every activity\u2014watching videos, reading, typing, etc.\nI\u2019m such a fan of this new technology that Pong cases have now become my go-to gift for family, friends and associates. Could you think of a more perfect baby shower, birthday or graduation gift? And, isn\u2019t it time you picked a Pong, too?\nCheck out www.pongresearch.com for more info.\nWould you kindly provide some clarification on the use of EMF shields versus these pong devices? If I (or my young teen) is wearing an EMF shield, do you believe we still need a pong device for our cell phone/iPad?\nYou write that the FCC cautions against products that claim to shield cell phone radiation. Do you still recommend the EMF shields you recently blogged about? The shields you previously recommended can be worn on the body or attached to a device such as a cell phone.\nI have always been concerned about cell phone safety especially when the user is a child and applaud your attention to this matter.\nI welcome your clarification on this subject I want to ensure I am following the best protocols. Thank you very much.\nThank you for your prompt reply, Nikhil. Additional guidance if you please. The SafeConnectPlus EMF shields recommended by ALG reportedly operate by reformatting the harmful waves from devices like cell phones/lap tops without interfering with the operation of the device.\nIf I am wearing such a reformatting EMF shield when I use my cell phone or IPad, would ALG also recommend I use a Pong simultaneously? Is such an EMF shield enough or would the simultaneous use of a Pong provide added protection? Thank you very much.\nSince the iPhones present yet another EMF challenge in terms of greater SAR and Information Carrying Waves, ALG recommends the personal shields as well as the Pong cases for those who have iPhones 4 and 4S and 3G. The SafeConnectPlus Sheilds she recommends for the home, personal protection, and for all other types of electronic or digital devices which are not iPhones."
