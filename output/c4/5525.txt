By indicating acceptance of this Agreement during the setup process or by using the Product, you are agreeing that Customer is bound by and your use of the Product on behalf of the Customer is governed by the terms and conditions of this Agreement.\n1.1 Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, RegLantern grants Customer a personal, non-exclusive, and non-transferable license to access and use the RegLantern software selected by Customer during the setup process (\"Product\"), which is a web-based product for use by Federally Qualified Community Health Centers.\n1.2 Product Availability. RegLantern will take commercially reasonable steps to keep the Product operating smoothly and efficiently. However, since the Product operates using computer equipment, computer software programs, and the Internet, RegLantern is not responsible for delays or service interruptions, including, without limitation, limitations on the availability of transmission lines and facilities, failures of other communications equipment, Internet access delays or failures, failures or deficiencies of Customer's equipment, or Customer's failure to meet its responsibilities under this Agreement. RegLantern will employ commercially reasonable measures to maintain the security of and protect Customer's data stored on or through the Product. In addition, RegLantern will maintain adequate back-up arrangements and equipment in order to maintain Customer's data stored on or through the Product in the event of the failure of any of RegLantern's equipment. Service interruptions for maintenance and system upgrades will be scheduled, to the extent reasonably practicable, to minimize interference with Customer's daytime business activities. For unscheduled service interruptions attributable to causes within RegLantern's reasonable control, as RegLantern's sole obligation and Customer's exclusive remedy, RegLantern shall make reasonable efforts to restore access to the Product.\n1.3 Proprietary Rights. Customer acknowledges that the Product, and associated report formats, screen displays, and features, and all derivative works, constitute copyrighted works protected by federal and international copyright laws and are owned by RegLantern or its licensors. The Product and all copies, versions, and derivative works of the Product shall remain the sole property of RegLantern or its licensors. Customer shall not make and shall not permit anyone else to make any copies of the Product. Customer shall not modify or create any derivatives of the Product. Customer shall not decompile or otherwise reverse engineer or decode the Product. Customer shall not take or refrain from taking, directly or indirectly, any action that may in any way lead to the unauthorized dissemination, reproduction, access, or use of the Product. Customer shall not export the Product, or any direct product thereof, directly or indirectly, in violation of the export laws and regulations of the United States of America.\n1.4 Consent to Use Data. RegLantern may collect and use information about Customer's computers, other devices, and usage of the Product, including aggregated usage data in anonymized format, to facilitate support, updates, and improvements to the Product and RegLantern's services, and to provide best practices guidance. RegLantern will not use such information in any way that personally identifies Customer.\n1.5 U.S. Government Rights. The Product and related materials are commercial in nature and developed solely at private expense. The Product and related materials are \"Commercial Items\", as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. \u00a72.101, consisting of \"Commercial Computer Software\" and \"Commercial Computer Software Documentation\", as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. \u00a712.212 or 48 C.F.R. \u00a7227.7202, as applicable.

Customer's obligations under this Section 1 shall survive termination of this Agreement. Customer acknowledges that a breach of its obligations under this Section 1 will cause irreparable harm to RegLantern or its licensors for which monetary damages would be inadequate. RegLantern or its licensors will be entitled to injunctive relief for any such breaches, threatened or actual.\n1.7 Advertising. If Customer selected a Product that RegLantern provides at no charge to Customer, Customer acknowledges that RegLantern may include advertising that appears during the use of such Product in order to recoup RegLantern's costs of making such Product available and other costs.\n1.8 Support. RegLantern will provide support resources at reglantern.com at no additional charge.\n1.9 Consulting Services. Upon Customer's request, RegLantern will provide Customer with consulting services related to the use of the Product on a time and expenses basis at RegLantern's then-current standard rates or as otherwise mutually agreed to by the parties in writing.\n2.1 Authorized Users. Customer shall be responsible for identifying those users who are authorized by Customer to access and use the Product (\"Authorized Users\"). Customer shall require each Authorized User to safeguard his or her user name and password for accessing the Product and otherwise comply with the provisions of this Agreement. An Authorized User may not disclose his or her user name and password to any other person, including another Authorized User. If Customer determines that another person has gained access to an Authorized User's user name and password, or that anyone has wrongfully accessed the Product, Customer shall promptly notify RegLantern.
