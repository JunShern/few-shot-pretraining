Thanks so much and have an amazing day!\nProposals are comprised of many important parts, such as your Overview, Sample Chapters, Writer Platform, and more. You only need a few sample chapters accompanied by a full proposal.\nConcerning freelance book proposal edits, I work on an hourly rate. If you have a budget, I can adjust my hours accordingly to meet your budget. I have personally sold 7 of my own books through nonfiction proposals to publishers. While I enjoy critiquing full manuscripts, I choose my projects carefully because of time limitations. I edit all genres of fiction, with the exception of picture books. This trial edit is the best way for us to get to know one another.\nAt that point, you can review my edits and see if you want to proceed with the entire book. It also gives me an opportunity to stop editing if I feel no connection with the project. To discuss editing rates, e-mail me. My primary e-mails are chucksambuchino gmail. Between the books, the blog, and his no-nonsense approach to pitching a book well, Chuck helped me avoid a heap of newbie errors that probably chopped my time in the query trenches in half.\nMy memoir, Swabbed and Found , became one that a publisher could get behind. Your help made a big difference. You did an edit on it for me years ago.\nYour comments made a big difference in my subsequent revisions. This is such a major milestone accomplished and I feel I am in very good hands. I also want to acknowledge that I believe I would have had very little likelihood of making it this far without all the editorial help you provided on my manuscript. So once again, thank you! She is SO passionate about my project. You are the best!\nRachel said that she found the manuscript intriguing, and enjoyed how I played with different themes in the tale. I mentioned you as my editor and she seemed pleased, stating that she knew you.\nYour conferences, books, and personal feedback helped me more than you know. Thank you very much. I would not have had found my agent, Sharlene Martin [of Martin Literary Management], without your manuscript and query edits. From my perspective, you are among the best editors out there, and I am grateful that you helped me. I hope to work with you again. You worked on [edited] so many of those stories. I know that it all made a significant difference. Thanks so much for everything!\nIt worked well \u2014 I received two offers! I know my submission package and my query letter greatly benefited from your work. Prior to your input, I had received not one iota of interest. Thank you for all you do\u2014you are a godsend. I finally got a book deal! My first novel will be published by The Wild Rose Press in ebook and print. They also want the next two books in the series. One of my projects for will be picked up by Waldorf Press. Thanks for all your help. Shortly after working with him, I sold my novel, Blackrock , to Barringer Publishing!\nSourcebooks released my novel, Send , in Your editorial notes were exactly what I needed! You were worth your weight in gold, and your edits helped me get offers from several agents!\nI am so thankful for the opportunity to work with Chuck. It is penultimate to have great guides and mentors along the path of writing and publication, Chuck is one of those guys.\nHis understanding of the components of a successful query made all the difference, and the revisions he suggested, I know, allowed my query to garner the attention of great agents.\nI was thrilled to receive many responses from agents and ultimately, two offers of representation. Chuck understands the publishing world and the art of the query. Pause for happy dance. I can not stress how helpful you were in this process.
