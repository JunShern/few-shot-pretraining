    "text": "The Bible tells us that God is love. John emphasizes just how important this aspect of God\u2019s nature is in 1 John 4. He says that if we don\u2019t love then we don\u2019t actually know God. God is so defined as being love that if we have a relationship with Him, we will love as well. It is a wonderful idea to contemplate.\nIt is not that God shows love or God is able to love, but He is love. Love is central to God\u2019s identity. What\u2019s more, there are a number of Greek words that John could have used to say love in this context. He chose agapos. It is a word that means an unconditional, self-less love. It is the love of a parent for a child or a husband for his wife. God is also limitless and eternal so His undeserved love is also boundless and never-ending."
