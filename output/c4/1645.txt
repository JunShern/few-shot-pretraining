    "text": "In our series Interview With A Team Member, we aim to introduce the people behind the JASP project. Today we are interviewing Akash Raj, one of our software developers.\nAkash is a software developer. At JASP, he is responsible for the implementation of UI elements. Akash also implemented the Summary Stats module.\nAfter a year of Electronics Engineering in my bachelor\u2019s, I decided to pursue a second degree in Computer Science. I worked as a software developer for about a year in Delhi. I am now enrolled in a research master\u2019s in Artificial Intelligence at the UvA.\nI first worked on JASP during my bachelor thesis with EJ Wagenmakers. I liked working on the program, its mission and the people in the lab. I helped implement the Summary stats module and set up the initial testing framework. Now, I contribute to various features of JASP.\nLinear Regression. I use this quite often and I\u2019ve come to appreciate its simplicity.\nData-editing and syncing. The idea of using your favourite editor/program (or even R) to modify and update data is ingenious.\nIt is free! JASP offers advanced capabilities, numerous statistical tests, formatted results and all of these for free. I believe this greatly helps everyone.\nAPIs to python, stan, and other statistical programs. Furthermore, the implementation of modules needs to be simpler and more dynamic, something that we\u2019re already working on. The combination of the two would unlock a world of possibilities.\nHands down Bayesian. And I always like it when my model predictions are coupled with information about uncertainty. Maybe, I am more of an \u2018Uncertaintist\u2019.\nLast week was my \u20182 year anniversary with JASP\u2019. In just 2 years, there have been so many developments, so many new features; I would not have imagined. I believe JASP is getting more popular every day. It is evident from the number of requests we get from the community, the growing team (and sometimes the bugs reported \ud83d\ude1b ).\nThere are many modules currently in development. I am also quite excited about the Machine Learning module. It would make some of the standard methods easily accessible to people.\nIn the future will Artificial intelligent beings take over humanity?\nI hope so \ud83d\ude09 On a more serious note, I believe that it is important to ensure that AI systems operate as intended. The topic of such \u2018AI safety\u2019 is both important and exciting."
