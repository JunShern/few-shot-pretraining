    "text": "Hello, here is some great information for students who are involved in the Boys & Girls Clubs of America (BGCA - http://www.bgca.org/Pages/index.aspx). As I was looking for another criminal justice scholarship to provide information about, I came across a scholarship that some students won from the BGCA chapter in their area. I was trying to find more information about that specific scholarship, but I couldn\u2019t find exact details or an application; however, I found information on other scholarships offered by other BGCA chapters. So I wanted to share the names of the scholarships so that students can see examples of local chapter scholarships, and then can check with their local chapter for information on other scholarships.\nThe first scholarship I came upon is the Darden Restaurant Foundation\u2019s Darden \u201cRecipe for Success\u201d Scholarship offered through the BGCA. This past year there were 68 winners and each were given a $3,000 scholarship. Also, there is a National Youth of the Year that will receive up to $87,000 in scholarships. This looks like a great opportunity, so students should definitely seek our more information from the local BGCA chapter.\nThe next scholarships are scholarships offered to local area students by the BGCA chapter in that area. In Trenton, NJ, the BGC of Trenton and PNC Bank awarded 2 scholarships to 2 local students to attend Mercer County Community College. The scholarship covers full tuition, expenses, and transportation costs. In Orangeburg, SC, the Orangeburg area BGC has started the Thomas Bruce Ecklund Foundation Scholarship for students who want to attend Claflin University, South Carolina State University or Orangeburg-Calhoun Technical College. The last scholarship information I found is from the Truckee Meadows BGC in the Northern Nevada area. They offer three different scholarships to the students at any of their 20 chapters: Boys & Girls Club of Truckee Meadows Scholarship - $500 per semester up to 10 semesters, Doris Pearce Memorial Scholarship - $500 per semester up to 10 semesters, and the Hot August Nights Foundation Scholarship - $500 per semester up to eight semesters.\nAll information about any scholarships can be found from the BGCA or local chapters. Students can find local chapters from this link: http://www.bgca.org/whoweare/Pages/FindaClub.aspx.\nI hope this information helps you criminal justice degree students who are looking for different types of criminal justice scholarships. Good luck."
