Later on this week the brigade will be involved in a mock MVA in the town centre with kids from both high schools in the area,we understand a large amount of media will be involved due mainly to a bad MVA that we had last week that took the life of a young local man.\nWhat are others doing for there youth in the area?\nOur cadets took part in the Youth team challenge at Woodhouse (and got Gold mind you!!). This is a fantastic day with almost 1400 kids involved over two days. It is a very good team builder and everyone gets something out of it."
