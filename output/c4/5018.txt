    "text": "The holidays are here, which means it\u2019s time for you to make your annual charitable donations in a desperate attempt to cleanse the stains your dark soul has accumulated this year. Below is a thoroughly vetted list of the most effective life-saving charities in the world.\nHere is the list of 18 charities dubbed \u201c2017's Best\u201d by The Life You Can Save, a respected site that encourages effective philanthropy\u2014meaning that these charities accomplish the most for the people with the greatest need per dollar donated.\nAnd here is the new list of the year\u2019s seven top charities from GiveWell, another respected charity evaluation site that focuses on effective giving.\nAgainst Malaria Foundation, which provides malaria nets that save lives.\nSchistosomiasis Control Initiative, which fights disease in sub-Saharan Africa.\nEvidence Action, which provides clean water and deworming programs.\nGiveDirectly, which sends money to the extreme poor.\nYou are likely not a superhero who saves lives very often, but you can legitimately save lives by donating to these charities.\nThe election of Donald Trump has had a chilling effect on many of our subscribers, our recommended charities, our Team at The Life You Can Save, and people throughout the United States and the World. There is an understandable desire to do something to mitigate the damage that a Trump presidency can do to the environment, the social safety net, and to civil liberties. At a time when many people wanted to advance in these areas beyond what the Obama administration has done, there is concern that we are about to take a dramatic step backwards. How does this impact effective giving?\nI would suggest that we continue to support the recommended charities on our new list at the same level we have in the past, or even at an increased level. The value of $1 given to a recommended charity still trumps (forgive the pun) the value of a dollar given domestically \u2014 even under the current political environment. However, as citizens I urge everyone to get involved in social movements to which they resonate whether the movement targets the environment, civil rights, or protecting our social safety net. If one feels the understandable urge to give to political movements or organizations fighting the Trump agenda then please consider giving more money over the next four years so that you don\u2019t diminish your gifts to fight global poverty.\nSo don\u2019t let Donald Trump make you forget the world\u2019s poorest people. Santa Claus is watching."
