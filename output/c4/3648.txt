I don\u2019t go to many conferences (I do hope to once I\u2019m done with graduate school), and know next to nothing about compensation for speaking, presenting, etc. It all seems rather confusing, bizarre and off putting. I have to applaud Dorothea Salo for her contribution to the discussion \u2013 The Library-Association Conference Paradox \u2013 in which she is quite up front about what she is getting for her participation. Really, these are the things nobody ever tells you \u2013 that you have to learn on your own (and probably in a rather painful way). They certainly do not teach you these things in library school.\nThe Liminal Librarian started this meme sometime last week. Life has been crazy, so although I thought about joining in, I didn\u2019t. But since I was tagged by Peter Bromberg from Library Garden earlier this week, I had to participate. I\u2019ve tried to highlight some of the blogs that haven\u2019t already been mentioned too many times. It has been interesting to note that many of us in the world of library blogs seem to read a high percentage of the same non-library blogs!!\nStar Wars Joke-A-Day \u2013 This one is just for fun. Yes, I\u2019m a Star Wars fanatic. There are some interesting blogs on the Star Wars Official Site \u2013 on which I have spent more time that I really want to acknowledge.\nPresentation Zen \u2013 A blog about professional presentation design.\nBloug\u2013 Louis Rosenfeld\u2019s blog on information architecture.\nYou are currently browsing the Life as I Know It blog archives for the day Wednesday, March 28th, 2007."
