    "text": "An IP Address is a string of numbers separated by periods that identifies each computer using the Internet Protocol to communicate over a network. For example, a typical IP Address may look like this: 100.000.000.000 or 192.168.1.66.\nFirst, tap on the Settings app, then on Wi-Fi. You will need to be connected to a router or access point to have an IP address.\nThen, tap on the 'i' to the right of the network to which your device is connected and you will see its IP address, along with your router's IP address (see photo on right).\nGenerally, you should go to Settings, then Wi-Fi, and then tap on the name of the network to which you're connected.\nStill having trouble finding your IP Address?"
