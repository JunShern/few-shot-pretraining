    "text": "Congratulations, this is no B.S. free zone!\nVisual artists are visual thinkers! So we made anatomy books for artists. They don't want to read magnificent, but boring anatomy textbooks, stuffed with medical level information.\nInstead, the author made a book with clear images, that contain only the necessary information needed, to create a realistic human form.\nMost pictures in the book are self-explanatory. The text part of this book is only about 2%.\nThe concept of this book came from co-author Uldis Zarins, classically trained sculptor, with 20 years of sculpting experience, looking for good visual anatomy book for his students, that would help to explain the forms of the human figure. After years of fruitless searching, Uldis decided to roll up his sleeves and take one for the team. So, he embarked on an epic quest to create a book for solid anatomical reference for any aspiring artist.\nThe book contains images of various examples of different postures, such as a twisted torso, the movement of arms etc. This means you don't have to guess anymore how each muscle will look from any angle.\n\"A secret weapon\" to making a realistic human form.\nWhat sets apart good classical artists from others? Major factors are the skills and practice of course, but good live model makes a huge difference! If you have a good reference, you won\u2019t need a live model anymore. Be inspired, and don\u2019t waste your precious time on the search for images in google, basically, everything you need is in this book!"
