Finally got around to starting it when the weather started taking a bad turn, and let\u2019s just say that listening to a family of assholes argue about what Christianity means to them is a perfect companion to the wind and rain outside. More posts about this wonderfully, beautifully horrible book a little later today.\nThe Guns of August, Barbara Tuchman. Her book The March of Folly, about military stupidity in the face of blinding fact, was one of my favorite books in college. This book is about the first month of WWI, and it reads like a novel. Especially, it reads like one of those slow train-crashes of a novel where you can see everyone doing the exact worst thing in the worst fashion to have the worst possible collision with their enemies. She adds in all of their thoughts and feelings about how the military intelligence of the time was stupid because it told them things they didn\u2019t want to hear. I\u2019m trying to read this without hearing Kaiser Wilhelm II scream \u201cInconceivable!\u201d in his best Wallace Shawn/ Vizzini voice every time he learns new information, but I\u2019m failing.\nA horrible, twisted system of control that kept the people of the Earth from advancing, and was only used so the Patriarchy could RUIN EVERYTHING.\nUnfortunately, I know enough of the setting and time of the novel to know that it\u2019s not going to have a happy ending, or at least not many of them, but I\u2019m still interested in it.\nUp on Deck: Caliban\u2019s War, James S. A. Corey, and Who Fears Death, Nnedi Okorafor.\nI think the first book would be something I could relate too. Hahaha!\nThe second doesn\u2019t really sound like my kinda thing.\nThe Third reminds me of the crap that is happening in the world today."
