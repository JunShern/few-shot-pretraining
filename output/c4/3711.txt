Tracked over time, these data give a directional indication of a company\u2019s progression in building a brand, connecting with customers, being talked about online, hiring employees, getting covered in the news, and more. Taken as single data points, these signals are just moments in time, but combined together over time they create a constellation of information that offers insight into how the lifecycle of each companies compares to others.\nIn this video, I discuss company growth with Tim Anglade of Scale Venture Partners for their interview series The Startup Tapes.\nIf you enjoyed this episode, you can find more episodes of The Startups Tapes and subscribe here."
