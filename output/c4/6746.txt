    "text": "10-31-2016 \u2013 A Word to the Wise: Deuteronomy 28:37 sets out in stark reality the affects of disobedience on one\u2019s heritage. Generational sins are passed from one generation to the next. In this passage, one of the chief generational \u201cgifts\u201d passed on is one of \u201ccaptivity.\u201d If you replace this word with another word, which spells out a specific type of captivity the result is astounding. By replacing the word \u201ccaptivity\u201d with \u201caddiction\u201d, one can see an immediate parallel to our society. Look how this problem rages among the children of the immoral. Immorality by one\u2019s parents results in the inheritance of addiction.\n10-31-2016 \u2013 A Word to the Wise: One biblical example comes from the life of King David. Near the age of fifty, David involved himself in an illicit affair with Bathsheba. He eventually had to murder her husband. Because of the affair, David loses everything\u2014children, position, and even his throne.\n10-25-2016 \u2013 A Word to the Wise: Spiritual consequences are also significant. But what is spiritual wealth? Spiritual wealth may be defined as those gifts that the Lord bestows for the common good. Some receive wisdom; others, financial insight; or others, perhaps special understanding of the demon world. Perhaps it may be the gift of healing. This refers to the special ability that some have to heal others. It is not referring to the hucksters among us who like to portray themselves as healers. Gifts are given so that we and others may grow and mature as godly people. Immorality destroys these god-given gifts. The immoral forfeit their god-given gifts by their behavior and estrange themselves from the living God, impoverishing themselves in the process. Thus, when scripture refers to \u201cleanness of spirit,\u201d it refers to the loss of these special gifts.\n10-24-2016 \u2013 A Word to the Wise: In most instances, remarriage does not diminish the negative consequences associated with single parenthood, and in some cases, it exacerbates problems. Children who live with a mother and stepfather or a mother and her partner do just as poorly in school and are just as likely to become teen mothers or spend time in jail as children who live with a single mother alone.\n10-20-2016 \u2013 A Word to the Wise: The effects of single motherhood are consistent across different race and ethnic groups and across different social classes. The effects are similar for boys and girls and for children who live apart from a parent in early childhood as well as in late childhood.\n10-17-2016 \u2013 A Word to the Wise: Yes, these consequences continue for the children. As the child gets older, the problems escalate. The consequences are even more negative when they are measured in adolescence and young adulthood. The age difference is probably due to the fact that behavioral problems have consequences that are more serious in young adulthood than in childhood For example, acting out in elementary school may lead to problems in the classroom, whereas acting out in adolescence may result in dropping out of school or getting pregnant."
