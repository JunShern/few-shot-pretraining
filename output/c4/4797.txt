    "text": "When you look at all your prospective clients, at any given point only about 3% are ready to buy. They are actively looking for a solution to their problem and have their credit card in hand.\nThe remainder of your prospects is not quite ready, yet. They have their wallets tucked away firmly, and if you even hint at making an offer to them, they will run for the hills.\n7% are somewhat open to your solution, just not now.\n30% are aware of their problem and know that they will have to do something about it eventually.\n30% are not yet aware that they have a problem.\n30% will for one reason or another not ever invest money to do anything about their issue.\nWhat that is telling you is that you are missing out on 67% of the market, if all you ever do is talk to a prospect once. And you can\u2019t just follow up once either. The vast majority of sales transactions happen after more than 5 (or more) followups. Yet, most entrepreneurs do not follow up at all or give up after the first attempt.\nSee, I get it. Follow up is laborious and time-consuming. But, wouldn\u2019t it be great if there was a way to automate that follow up?\nImagine someone visiting your website to read an article you published and then hand over their email address to get something neat you offered to readers of that post.\nImagine now an automated process that determines what phase that person is in. Are they still trying to learn what the problem they are experiencing is about, or are they already further along the customer journey and are looking for information on a specific solution to their problem?\nBecause, depending on where they are at, you need to talk to them differently. And figuring that out by hand is hard work. But if you can get that information on autopilot, you can use it to send just the right message at the right time to get them closer to the place where they are ready to invest in your offer.\nThat is, what the Infusionsoft\u2122 CRM can do for you. And it goes way beyond that. No matter if you are using a simple website with a lead capture process or if you are using a full-fledged sales team, the Infusionsoft\u2122 CRM allows you to automate the follow-up, automate sending out the right message at the right time, and even automate getting your leads to schedule a conversation with you. And then it notifies you when it is time for you (or your team) to call the prospect directly.\nWhen you use the Infusionsoft\u2122 CRM, you not only get more of your leads to convert, you also have to spend less time on making it happen. Time you don\u2019t have to waste on running after opportunities. Time you can spend on things that are more important in your life (or business).\nNow you might be wondering, whether I use Infusionsoft myself, and why I did not go for any of the plenty of other email service providers (ESPs) out there.\nThe answer is simple. Yes, I do. There is really nothing out there for small businesses that compares. First, all the magic to figure out what message to send next when \u2013 to each individual prospect is something many ESPs can\u2019t do. But even amongst the ones that do, the Infusionsoft\u2122 CRM stands out.\nIt has been one of the first that offered that functionality, so it has a mature foundation. That means that you get more features than with many others. Also, more third-party apps already have a direct integration with the Infusionsoft\u2122 CRM. But most importantly, you will run into random issues way less frequently than with other applications. And yes, I have worked with many of them. I have run into problems with all of them (including Infusionsoft\u2122). But the issues with the Infusionsoft\u2122 CRM tend to be less severe.\nAlso, many of the other solutions just offer email support. With Infusionsoft\u2122 you can actually get a knowledgeable and helpful person on the phone (or chat, if you prefer).\nSo really, where you might find yourself in the rain with other solutions, you have someone to talk to, someone willing and able to actually help you if you use the Infusionsoft\u2122 CRM.\nNextHow to use the Net Promoter Score to generate an Endless Flow of Qualified Customers, Patients, and Clients."
