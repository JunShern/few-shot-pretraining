The Argent Dawn will start its operations in the Plaguelands on the 23rd of January \u2013 unlocking new missions to complete and new items to obtain.\nNearing the end of the month, Horde and Alliance forces will join together in order to prepare to fight the Qiraji in Silithus and the Ahn\u2019Qiraj.\nThe War Effort will start on the 30th of January and will last roughly up to the middle of March. Contribution from the heroes of Azeroth is more than welcome. Furthermore, once the War Effort is complete, the release of the Ahn\u2019Qiraj might be slightly altered (+- few hours) to fit most of our team and player base.\nBelow you can find a list of new additions to the game with each release.\nSee you on the other side of the Gates of the Ahn\u2019Qiraj!"
