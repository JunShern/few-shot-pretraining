    "text": "In January I wrote in my blog Unexpected Blessing that we were expecting a fifth baby. It was quite the surprise and in trying to get our heads around the news God has taken us on quite the journey as we have come to terms with His plans for our lives! I used that blog to reflect upon God\u2019s Sovereignty, Wisdom and Love which I used as a framework to think about all that was going on in our lives. You may also have read in my blog Hope in the God who Provides where I also wrestled with the challenge to trust in God to provide amidst the challenges arising from the imminent arrival of our new addition. I spent some time thinking about the character of God as the God who provides and the one who gives good gifts to His children.\nThe title of this post probably gives away the fact that yesterday God brought Aaron Matthew McClure into the world (13 days early). There was a plan set in place to gently encourage his arrival today but it seems that he was not eager to wait for that! After an excellent evening last night with the new CU committee Debbie declared that she was in labour and young Aaron was born at 11:39pm weighing in at 6lbs 12 ounces (our smallest baby yet). Debbie and Aaron will remain in the hospital for another day or so before returning home when we will then be united as a family of seven (plus the 2 cats and 4 fish).\nPutting all this into perspective we\u2019ve also been reflecting on the journey the Lord has been leading us on these past few months. While we were away in the Lake District God seemed to be speaking to Debbie about peace; something that is far easier to experience up in the fells listening to the sounds of the wildlife and the endless running water of the rivers and lakes.\nWhat I fi nd incredible about these words is the way that Jesus (who is called the \u2018Prince of Peace\u2019) has gently led Debbie back to Himself sowing seeds of hope which in turn have sown seeds of peace. Now of course is when the rubber its the road as we prepare to bring our precious little one back home. One kind of peace is most definitely on hold while new baby learns to sleep through the night. This other kind of peace however (which Debbie has been reflecting on above) is something that the \u201cGod of hope\u201d is seeking to fill us with (alongside His joy) as we trust in Him. Why? So that we in turn might \u201coverflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit\u201d.\nThanks so much for your prayers these past months. We really value them and can see how they continue to make a huge difference in our lives. Please do keep remembering us and each of these precious children God has given to us (Benjamin, Naomi, Samuel, Jacob and Aaron) before the \u2018throne of grace\u2019.\nWhat sweet photos of precious Aaron Matthew! Love the meaning of his name. Praising God together with you for his healthy arrival. Debbie you look so happy..and amazing by the way..way to go! \ud83d\ude42 We will continue to pray for health and recovery as you enjoy these first sweet hours together. We\u2019ll also pray for God\u2019s peace and joy (as you both described so well in the words and verses in this post) to infuse your hearts and home as you transition into this new beginning in your family.\nWith love and hugs and prayers from all of us!\nSo good to hear that baby has arrived safely. May you know the Lord\u2019s rich blessings on your lives at this special time and in the days ahead. Hebrews 12:2."
