They are available in amounts of $10, $15, $20, $25 and $30. We send them immediately to you. Overnight shipping is available.\nNext, distribute the Gift Cards to employees, customers and friends. Payday is an easy time to do this.\nRecipients redeem the Gift Cards you gave them at any grocery store they choose at any time they choose for any groceries. The grocery store handles the Gift Cards the same way it handles any other cents-off coupon. It's that simple.\nAny food items can be purchased with gThankYou Gift Cards.\nYes. Prohibited items include alcoholic beverages, tobacco products, prescription drugs or other non-food items.\nOur FREE Enclosure Cards are on heavy, high-quality paper; they are 3-inches (high) by 4-inches (wide).\nWe customize Enclosure Cards with your Company's message and logo.\nFor more details go to our FREE Enclosure Cards page.\nYes. When you place your order, there will be a space to submit the name of the Certificate Giver. If you leave the \u201cFrom\u201d space blank, we'll leave it blank on the Certificates.\nYes. There are two ways to do this. gThankYou will do this for you or we can leave the \u201cRecipient\u201d space on the Certificates blank so you can personalize them with recipients' names.\nIf you would like gThankYou to imprint the Gift Cards with employee names, you may enter up to 10 names in our Shopping Cart.\nOr, you can email us a spreadsheet (such as Microsoft Excel) with all the names listed. Please enter one complete name per spreadsheet cell. Please call for complete instructions.\nWhat dollar value Certificates should I purchase?\nThat's up to you. The greater the dollar value of the Certificates you purchase, the more groceries the Gift Card recipients receive.\nNo problem. The recipient just pays the difference. That means they pay the extra cost of the groceries that is greater than the amount of the Gift Card(s).\nShipping charges vary depending on the delivery service you choose. For example, UPS Ground service is $10 for any number of Gift Cards purchased.\nNo. You may purchase any number of certificates.\nPay with a major credit card. gThankYou accepts Visa, MasterCard and American Express.\nWhat if I want to receive the Grocery Gift Cards by tomorrow?\nNo problem.
