    "text": "The future of filmmaking revealed at the New Directors Showcase in Cannes 2013 \u2013 Its great but lookout!\n\nEvery year Saatchi & Saatchi host the New Director\u2019s Showcase in Cannes. It is one of the most anticipated events at the festival and gives a glimpse into the future of filmmaking. Last year was very powerful, where we could see the growing importance of detail and seeing every moment in full glory, a bit as a retaliation towards a world moving so fast that things pass you by (see article here).\n\nThis year the quality of the films was no exception. Gore and brutal reality was a noticeable theme possibly a reflection of the very turbulent year that just passed us by. Equally pertinent was a theme that I will call \u201cthe naked truth\u201d. Several films reflected societal truths through a filmmakers magnifying glass which made them not only super clear, but somewhat allowed the viewer to see the lighter side of reality.\n\nThe extreme emotional power of the films and their blatant attempt to make you sit up, squirm, and be taken on a ride made me think about the challenge that storytelling faces in the future. The law of hedonic asymmetry states that we can never become accustomed to certain awful circumstances while positive emotions fade over time, regardless of how high they are. As such, marketers may have to occasionally lean into the negative emotional space from time to time to really cement memory. Moreover, the need to accelerate the volume of positive stories will become more likely given that they positive highs are getting higher and thus only volume will sustain these emotions. We will see. You can see all the films on the New Director\u2019s Showcase Youtube Channel \u2013 see here"
