    "text": "Salkantay and Machu Picchu: Part 2\n\nMachu Picchu\n\nThe famous Machu Picchu\u2026 we weren\u2019t really sure what to expect. Some say it\u2019s the most amazing thing they have ever seen, while other\u2019s claim places we\u2019ve already visited are superior and don\u2019t require dealing with the hoards of tourists and the hefty expense. The day to decide for ourselves had come!\n\nWe awoke at 4:30a to get in line for the 5:30a bus. We were pretty near the front and made it on one of the first buses. But while we waited, we watched in amazement as people emerged from every alley and building. It was as if the town was secreting tourists from every crack in the pavement into the line that now stretched far up the street into the darkness. After the standard, single-lane, muddy, switchback-ridden Peruvian bus ride we made our way through the entrance and walked up to the famous lookout for our first view of Machu Picchu.\n\nDespite having seen it in so many pics it was still astonishing. Large smiles stretched across everyone\u2019s faces. The sun had just crested the steep ridge line behind us and illuminated the ruins, which for a few more moments would remain uncluttered by the masses. Only shadows and a seemingly lost wisp of cloud competed with the ruins for space in our view. The verdict was in for me: truly amazing. The Incas had carved out a permanent spot in my memory with this awe inspiring place!\n\nClick to enlarge!\n\nWe hung out and snapped photos for a while enjoying the enormous view as the sun continued to rise.\n\nWith our entrance tickets we had purchased an additional admission to the hike up Machu Picchu Mountain. Right\u2026 why not hike 2,000 feet straight up steep stairs for a mile after a 4 day, 40 mile trek through the Andes! We got after it early to beat the heat and crowds. The old Inca stairs seemed endless as they cut up the mountain to the highest point surrounding the ruins.\n\nLooking down at MP from the stairs!\n\nWe knocked it out pretty quickly passing everyone on the trail and had the summit all to ourselves to goof around with the cameras!\n\n\u201cIn this moment you will see Barba Picchu my friends.\u201dCrew shot!\n\nWe made the hike down the stairs after a snack on the top. Old knee injuries made their presence felt but this truly marked the last of the hiking for our team! Between Machu Picchu Mountain and the Salkantay we had hiked a combined 41 miles with 18,691 feet of elevation change in 5 days! Not too shabby eh? We switched over to flip flops and enjoyed the rest of the ruins.\n\nFirst we wandered over to the Inca Bridge. In the previous post I had posted a photo of the cliff from the ground on our hike in. Today we could see that the green ledge of vegetation stretching far across the length of the cliff was actually part of the Inca Bridge and was one of two access points for the secret ruins.\n\nFrom here we finally descended into the main ruins to check out the dwellings, plazas, temples and other buildings\u2026 and the grass maintenance crew \u2013 aka the alpacas.\n\nSector de los TemplosA Chinchilla. These guys just sit silently on the rocks and look wise.Templo de las Tres Ventanas\n\nThe stone work is amazing. Blocks that fit so precisely together it\u2019s mind boggling and other blocks all over the place that are so large it\u2019s hard to believe they were able to move them.\n\nTemple of the Condor\n\nOne of the reasons Machu Picchu is so spectacular is the landscape it is surrounded by. Not only do you have the beautifully restored ruins, but a peak through a window or a view around a corner reveals staggering knife blade mountains covered in dense green as they reach for the sky. It\u2019s no wonder this place provoked the imagination of the Incas\u2026 and after three days of almost constant clouds we were all really stoked for good weather and clear views, though by the end of our visit the clouds were rallying once again and the familiar threat of rain loomed.\n\nClick to enlarge\n\nHaving fully explored Machu Picchu and feeling quite satisfied we jumped a bus back to town. No sooner than we arrived back in Aguas Calientes the clouds that had been building released a huge down pour. We sought refuge in a restaurant and had some victory beers!\n\nFrom Aguas Calientes we jumped a train to Ollantaytambo and then a collectivo from there back to Cusco. I\u2019ll leave you off with a little footage from the train ride. We were in high spirits\u2026\n\nI\u2019m a little late catching up in your travels, but what the hey! Thanks for the great M P shots. It brings back special memories. We took the train from Cusco to M P, but don\u2019t recall it being so rock \u2018n\u2019 roly."
