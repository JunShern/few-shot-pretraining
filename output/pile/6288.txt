    "text": "In haec verba\n\nIn haec verba (meaning \"in these words\") is a phrase in Latin legal usage, which refers to incorporating verbatim text into a complaint, pleading or other legal document as was mentioned in a deed or agreement which is in question or cause of dispute, or in another legal instrument (such as a legal description, statute, etc.). This is done by reciting the words verbatim in the pleading rather than by attaching a copy to the pleading or other legal instrument. \n\nFor example, Delaware Code, tit. 8, \u00a7 102(b)(2) permits a corporation to enter into a compromise with its creditors if the corporation has included the specific language of the statute in haec verba in its certification of incorporation; thus, the exact language of the statute must be recited verbatim in the certificate of incorporation in order to take advantage of this statutory provision.\n\nReferences\n\nCategory:Latin legal terminology"
