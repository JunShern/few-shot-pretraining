Please re-tag them as onedrive and make \"skydrive\" a synonym.\n\nA:\n\nThe simplest solution would be for someone to retag one question with onedrive then we can merge the tags.\nThis will have the effect of retagging the rest of the questions tagged skydrive and automatically convert \"skydrive\" to \"onedrive\" when anyone uses it on a new question.\nThis has now been done.\n\n"
