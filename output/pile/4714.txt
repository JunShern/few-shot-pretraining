Defendant filed\n       a pretrial motion to quash arrest and suppress evidence, arguing that police improperly used a\n       Global Positioning System (GPS) device without a warrant to track the movements of a vehicle\n       he used. The trial court denied the motion. Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted of\n       all charges, and sentenced to 20 years in prison on the aggravated robbery charge. The\n       appellate court reversed and remanded. We allowed the State\u2019s petition for leave to appeal. Ill.\n       S. Ct. R. 315 (eff. July 1, 2013).\n\n\u00b62                                          BACKGROUND\n\u00b63         In April 2009, Aurora police received a tip from the Crime Stoppers hotline that defendant\n       was committing burglaries on the west side of Aurora and bringing \u201cvarious items\u201d into his\n       apartment complex. The police located defendant\u2019s address at the apartment complex after a\n       data search. Police also discovered that defendant was on mandatory supervised release from\n       prison. They also knew that in a recent police encounter defendant had been arrested for\n       fleeing in a red Kia Spectra with license plate X743***. The Kia was registered to Stephanie\n       Powell, who lived at the same address as defendant.\n\u00b64         On April 23, 2009, Aurora police detective Jeremy Shufelt placed a GPS device under the\n       rear bumper of the Kia while it was parked at the apartment complex where defendant resided.\n       Detective Shufelt did not obtain a warrant to place the GPS device on the car\u2019s exterior. Early\n       the next morning, a local gas station located a few minutes from defendant\u2019s residence was\n       held up. Tracking from the GPS device showed that the Kia was parked near the gas station at\n       the time it was robbed around 4:40 a.m.\n\u00b65         A surveillance camera captured the robbery on video. It showed that the robber used what\n       looked like a shotgun. He took the cash drawer and a carton of Newport cigarettes from the\n       cashier and fled. The video also showed that the robber was wearing a pair of Steve Madden\n       athletic shoes, which have a distinctive striping pattern on them.\n\u00b66         On the evening of the same day as the robbery, police conducted a parole search of\n       defendant\u2019s residence. Defendant arrived at the apartment complex driving the Kia at the same\n       time the police were conducting their search of his residence. Defendant was taken into\n       custody for driving with a revoked license. He was wearing Steve Madden athletic shoes.\n       During the search, the police recovered a hollow metal cane that had the rubber tip removed\n       from the end.\n\n\n                                                  -2-\n\f\u00b67          When defendant was interviewed, the police told him that he had been under surveillance,\n       but they did not tell him about the use of the GPS device. The police also told him that the\n       apartment complex\u2019s video camera showed him leaving early in the morning. After the police\n       placed the metal cane in the interview room, defendant confessed, explaining that he made the\n       cane look like a gun by removing the rubber stopper at the end and placing a black\n       grocery-type bag around the center. The cashier from the store later picked defendant out of a\n       photo lineup.\n\u00b68          Defendant was eventually charged with aggravated robbery, robbery and burglary in the\n       circuit court of Kane County. Defendant filed a motion to quash his arrest and suppress\n       evidence, arguing that it was solely through information received through the GPS tracking\n       device that defendant became a suspect in the robbery and therefore all the evidence against\n       him should be suppressed. The trial court denied the motion, finding that the use and \u201cthe\n       existence\u201d of the GPS device, which did not interfere with defendant\u2019s possessory interest in\n       the vehicle, did not constitute a search under either the federal or state constitutions. Relying\n       upon United States v. Knotts, 460 U.S. 276 (1983), United States v. Karo, 468 U.S. 705 (1984),\n       and United States v. Garcia, 474 F.3d 994 (7th Cir. 2007), as controlling authority, the court\n       concluded that the fourth amendment was not violated because \u201cthe information secured by the\n       police was equal to what personal surveillance would have revealed and [was] available from\n       the observations that could have been made on or about the public way or the publicly\n       accessible locations.\u201d\n\u00b69          Defendant represented himself at his trial and the jury found him guilty of all charges. The\n       trial court entered judgment on the aggravated battery charge and sentenced defendant to 20\n       years in prison. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to\n       quash arrest and suppress evidence, and that the court erroneously allowed him to waive\n       counsel without properly admonishing him under Illinois Supreme Court Rule 401(a) (eff. July\n       1, 1984).\n\u00b6 10        While this case was pending on appeal in the appellate court, the United States Supreme\n       Court decided United States v. Jones, 565 U.S. ___, ___, 132 S. Ct. 945, 948-49 (2012), which\n       held that the attachment of a GPS tracking device and the subsequent use of the device to\n       monitor a vehicle\u2019s movements on public streets was a search under the fourth amendment\n       because the placement of the device constituted an unlawful trespass. Also while this case was\n       pending on appeal, the Supreme Court decided Davis v. United States, 564 U.S. ___, 131 S. Ct.\n       2419 (2011). In Davis, the Court applied the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule to an\n       automobile search conducted by a state police officer \u201cin objectively reasonable reliance on\n       binding judicial precedent.\u201d Id. at ___, 131 S. Ct. at 2428-29.\n\u00b6 11        Prior to the oral argument before the appellate court in the present case, the State submitted\n       Jones as additional authority. 2013 IL App (2d) 100659, \u00b6 83 (Birkett, J., concurring in part\n       and dissenting in part). The parties were then directed to address Davis and whether the\n       good-faith exception applied. Id. At oral argument, the State argued that Knotts and Karo were\n       \u201cbinding precedent\u201d at the time the search was conducted, and defendant argued that those two\n       cases were distinguishable because they involved \u201cbeeper\u201d tracking devices and not the more\n       advanced GPS technology used here. Id. \u00b6 108.\n\u00b6 12        A divided appellate court reversed defendant\u2019s conviction based on Jones and remanded\n       for further proceedings to determine whether defendant borrowed the vehicle with Powell\u2019s\n\n\n                                                    -3-\n\f       consent so as to establish standing under Jones. Id. \u00b6 29 (majority opinion). The appellate court\n       majority accepted defendant\u2019s argument that the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule\n       was not applicable due to the more advanced nature of GPS tracking. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 44-45. However,\n       Justice Birkett in his partial dissent determined, among other things, that the good-faith\n       exception applied and that the evidence that resulted from the GPS tracking should not be\n       excluded. He concluded that the trial court correctly ruled that Knotts and Karo were \u201cbinding\n       precedent\u201d that controlled the outcome at the time the search was conducted in April 2009. Id.\n       \u00b6 115 (Birkett, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Finally, the appellate court was in\n       unanimous agreement that the defendant\u2019s convictions must be reversed and the cause\n       remanded for a new trial based on the trial court\u2019s failure to properly admonish defendant\n       pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 401(a) (Ill. S. Ct. R. 401(a) (eff. July 1, 1984)). 2013 IL App\n       (2d) 100659, \u00b6 60.\n\u00b6 13       We allowed the State\u2019s petition for leave to appeal. Ill. S. Ct. R. 315 (eff. July 1, 2013).\n       Before this court, the State concedes that the appellate court correctly determined that\n       defendant must be retried based on the lack of proper admonishments under Supreme Court\n       Rule 401(a). The State contends, however, that upon remand for a new trial, there is no need\n       for the trial court to hold a new suppression hearing. In that regard, three issues are raised\n       before this court: (1) whether the fourth amendment permitted police to place a GPS device on\n       a car associated with defendant, where defendant was on mandatory supervised release from\n       prison at the time and thus had a diminished expectation of privacy from that of an ordinary\n       citizen; (2) whether defendant is entitled to a remand to present new evidence to establish his\n       interest in the Kia so that he can avail himself of the holding in Jones; and (3) whether the\n       good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule is applicable under the circumstances of this case\n       so that the evidence compiled against defendant as a result of the installation and use of the\n       GPS device should not be excluded. For the reasons that follow, we find that the good-faith\n       exception to the exclusionary rule is applicable and that a new suppression hearing is therefore\n       not warranted. Because this issue is dispositive, we find it unnecessary to address the two other\n       issues raised by the parties.\n\n\u00b6 14                                            ANALYSIS\n\u00b6 15       The fourth amendment to the United States Constitution provides that:\n                   \u201c[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects,\n               against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall\n               issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly\n               describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\u201d U.S. Const.,\n               amend. IV.\n\u00b6 16       In a similar fashion, the Illinois Constitution provides that:\n                   \u201c[t]he people shall have the right to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and\n               other possessions against unreasonable searches, seizures, invasions of privacy or\n               interceptions of communications by eavesdropping devices or other means. No warrant\n               shall issue without probable cause, supported by affidavit particularly describing the\n               place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized.\u201d Ill. Const. 1970, art. I, \u00a7 6.\n       This court interprets the search and seizure clause of the Illinois Constitution in \u201climited\n       lockstep\u201d with its federal counterpart. People v. Caballes, 221 Ill. 2d 282, 314 (2006).\n\n                                                    -4-\n\f\u00b6 17        Searches conducted without a warrant are per se unreasonable under the fourth amendment\n       subject only to a few exceptions. Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 357 (1967). The\n       Supreme Court created the exclusionary rule as a general deterrent to future fourth amendment\n       violations. Arizona v. Evans, 514 U.S. 1, 10 (1995). Despite the exclusionary rule\u2019s\n       relationship to the fourth amendment, however, there is no constitutional right to have the\n       fruits of an illegal search or seizure suppressed at trial. United States v. Katzin, 769 F.3d 163,\n       170 (3d Cir. 2014) (en banc) (noting that the fourth amendment \u201c \u2018says nothing about\n       suppressing evidence in violation of [its] command\u2019 \u201d (citing Davis, 564 U.S. at ___, 131 S. Ct.\n       at 2426)). The judicially created doctrine of exclusion at times suppresses the evidence and\n       makes it unavailable for trial. However, even when a fourth amendment violation has\n       occurred, the evidence that resulted will not be suppressed when the good-faith exception to\n       the exclusionary rule applies. Katzin, 769 F.3d at 169-70.\n\u00b6 18        In the present case, we need not determine whether Aurora police conducted an\n       unreasonable search in violation of Jones. Nor do we need to remand for further proceedings to\n       determine whether defendant had a sufficient possessory interest in the Kia to avail himself of\n       the holding in Jones. This is because even assuming that the search violated the fourth\n       amendment, the good-faith exception is applicable and suppression is not warranted.\n\u00b6 19        Defendant seeks to avoid that result by arguing that Aurora police do not fall under the\n       good-faith exception as explained in Davis because Knotts and Karo are distinguishable cases\n       that the officers could not have reasonably relied upon. Defendant argues that both cases are\n       distinguishable because they involved beeper tracking and not GPS technology and did not\n       involve a trespass of the device onto the vehicle\u2019s exterior without the consent of the owner.\n       Defendant also argues that police could not have reasonably relied upon Garcia, a Seventh\n       Circuit Court of Appeals case directly on point, because that case \u201cis not binding precedent on\n       Illinois courts.\u201d In defendant\u2019s view, binding precedent only exists if it is from the same\n       jurisdiction in which the case is prosecuted, is followed by police to the \u201cletter,\u201d and is on all\n       fours with the case to be decided.\n\u00b6 20        As we will explain more fully below, defendant\u2019s reading of Davis is incorrect and too\n       narrow. Acceptance of the narrow interpretation of Davis proposed by defendant would mean\n       neglecting or ignoring the important principles that have been set forth by the Supreme Court\n       to help determine whether the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule should apply in\n       any given case. We also note at the outset that all of the federal circuits that have considered\n       post-Jones whether the good-faith exception applies in cases of warrantless GPS searches\n       conducted pre-Jones have rejected a narrow reading of Davis and have instead concluded that\n       the good-faith exception applies under circumstances identical to the present case. E.g., United\n       States v. Katzin, 769 F.3d 163 (3d Cir. 2014) (en banc) (although the facts of Knotts and Karo\n       differ from Jones, it is the rationale that underpins those decisions that is considered binding\n       appellate precedent and that it was objectively reasonable for the officers to rely upon the\n       precedent under Davis); United States v. Stephens, 764 F.3d 327, 338 (4th Cir. 2014)\n       (\u201c[w]ithout the benefit of hindsight *** and with no contrary guidance from the Supreme\n       Court or this Court, *** a reasonably well-trained officer in this Circuit could have relied on\n       Knotts as permitting the type of warrantless GPS usage in this case\u201d); United States v. Brown,\n       744 F.3d 474, 478 (7th Cir. 2014) (rehearing and rehearing en banc denied) (observing that \u201call\n       of the extant appellate precedent is on the side of applying Davis\u201d and its good-faith exception\n       to \u201call pre-Jones GPS tracking,\u201d even when installation was nonconsensual and without a\n\n                                                   -5-\n\f       warrant (emphasis in original)); United States v. Aguiar, 737 F.3d 251, 261 (2d Cir. 2013)\n       (found that at the time police placed the GPS tracking device on the defendant\u2019s car in 2009,\n       law enforcement could reasonably rely upon the binding appellate precedent of Knotts and\n       Karo); United States v. Sparks, 711 F.3d 58, 65 (1st Cir. 2013) (noting that even though the\n       circuit had not addressed warrantless GPS tracking prior to Jones, the Supreme Court\u2019s\n       decision in Knotts was \u201csufficiently clear and apposite\u201d to trigger Davis\u2019s good-faith\n       exception); see also Kelly v. State, 82 A.2d 205, 214 (Md. 2013) (the state\u2019s highest court\n       determined that Knotts was sufficient binding appellate precedent in Maryland to authorize\n       GPS tracking at the time officers installed the device to the defendant\u2019s vehicle pre-Jones).\n\n\u00b6 21                        I. Exclusionary Rule and the Good-Faith Exception\n\u00b6 22       We turn now to the guiding principles that should govern any analysis as to the\n       applicability of the exclusionary rule or its good-faith exception. There is no constitutional\n       right to have the evidence resulting from an illegal search or seizure suppressed at trial. Katzin,\n       769 F.3d at 170 (quoting Davis, 564 U.S. at ___, 131 S. Ct. at 2426). The mere fact of a fourth\n       amendment violation does not mean that exclusion necessarily follows. Id. Instead, application\n       of the exclusionary rule has been restricted to those \u201cunusual cases\u201d where it can achieve its\n       sole objective: to deter future fourth amendment violations. Id. (citing United States v. Leon,\n       468 U.S. 897, 909 (1984)). The Supreme Court has repeatedly expressed the notion that\n       \u201cexclusion \u2018has always been our last resort, not our first impulse.\u2019 \u201d Herring v. United States,\n       555 U.S. 135, 140 (2009).\n\u00b6 23       In order for exclusion of the evidence to apply, the deterrent benefit of suppression must\n       outweigh the \u201csubstantial social costs.\u201d Leon, 468 U.S. at 907. \u201c \u2018Exclusion exacts a heavy toll\n       on both the judicial system and society at large,\u2019 because it \u2018almost always requires courts to\n       ignore reliable, trustworthy evidence bearing on guilt or innocence,\u2019 and \u2018its bottom-line\n       effect, in many cases, is to suppress the truth and set the criminal loose in the community\n       without punishment.\u2019 \u201d Stephens, 764 F.3d at 335 (quoting Davis, 564 U.S. at ___, 131 S. Ct. at\n       2427). \u201cAs this result conflicts with the \u2018truth-finding functions of judge and jury,\u2019 United\n       States v. Payner, 447 U.S. 727, 734 *** (1980), exclusion is a \u2018bitter pill,\u2019 Davis, 131 S. Ct. at\n       2427, swallowed only as a \u2018last resort,\u2019 Hudson, 547 U.S. at 591, 126 S. Ct. 2159.\u201d Katzin, 769\n       F.3d at 171. In order for the exclusionary rule to be appropriate then, the deterrent benefits\n       must outweigh its heavy costs. Davis, 564 U.S. at ___, 131 S. Ct. at 2427.\n\u00b6 24       Where the particular circumstances of a case show that police acted with an \u201c \u2018objectively\n       \u201creasonable good-faith belief\u201d that their conduct [was] lawful,\u2019 \u201d or when their conduct\n       involved only simple, isolated negligence, there is no illicit conduct to deter. Katzin, 769 F.3d\n       at 171 (quoting Davis, 564 U.S. at ___, 131 S. Ct. at 2427-28, quoting Leon, 468 U.S. at 909).\n       In such a case, \u201c \u2018the deterrence rationale loses much of its force and exclusion cannot pay its\n       way.\u2019 \u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)

Thus, exclusion is invoked only where police\n       conduct is both \u201csufficiently deliberate\u201d that deterrence is effective and \u201csufficiently culpable\u201d\n       that deterrence outweighs the cost of suppression. Herring, 555 U.S. at 144; Katzin, 769 F.3d\n       at 171.\n\u00b6 25       The \u201cpertinent analysis of deterrence and culpability is objective, not an inquiry into the\n       subjective awareness of arresting officers.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)

Thus, in determining whether the good-faith exception applies, a court must ask\n       \u201cthe objectively ascertainable question whether a reasonably well trained officer would have\n       known that the search was illegal in light of all of the circumstances.\u201d (Internal quotation\n       marks omitted.) Id. (quoting Leon, 468 U.S. at 922 n.23).\n\n\u00b6 26                   II. Davis\u2019s Application to the Specific Circumstances Before It\n\u00b6 27       In Davis, the Supreme Court applied the good-faith exception in one specific instance: to\n       an automobile search following an arrest conducted by a local Greenville, Alabama, city police\n       officer investigating a state DUI offense. The question for the Court was whether the officer\n       could have reasonably relied upon an Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals precedent as authority\n       for his conduct in deciding to search the vehicle. In that case, police found in the course of their\n       search a handgun in defendant\u2019s jacket left inside the vehicle, and defendant was subsequently\n       prosecuted for a firearm charge in federal court. Davis held that \u201csearches conducted in\n       objectively reasonable reliance on binding appellate precedent are not subject to the\n       exclusionary rule.\u201d Davis, 564 U.S. at ___, 131 S. Ct. at 2423-24. The Court explained that\n       \u201c[a]n officer who conducts a search in reasonable reliance on binding appellate precedent does\n       no more than ac[t] as a reasonable officer would and should act under the circumstances.\n       [Citation.] The deterrent effect of exclusion in such a case can only be to discourage the officer\n       from do[ing] his duty.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. at ___, 131 S. Ct. at 2429. Of\n       paramount importance to the Court\u2019s holding was the lack of police culpability:\n                    \u201cUnder our exclusionary-rule precedents, [the] acknowledged absence of police\n                culpability dooms Davis\u2019s claim. Police practices trigger the harsh sanction of\n                exclusion only when they are deliberate enough to yield \u2018meaningfu[l]\u2019 deterrence, and\n                culpable enough to be \u2018worth the price paid by the justice system.\u2019 [Citation.] The\n                conduct of the officers here was neither of these things. The officers who conducted the\n                search did not violate Davis\u2019s *** rights deliberately, recklessly, or with gross\n                negligence. [Citation.] Nor does this case involve any \u2018recurring or systemic\n                negligence\u2019 on the part of law enforcement. [Citation.] The police acted in strict\n                compliance with binding precedent, and their behavior was not wrongful. Unless the\n                exclusionary rule is to become a strict-liability regimen, it can have no application in\n                this case. Indeed, in 27 years of practice under Leon\u2019s good-faith exception, we have\n                \u2018never applied\u2019 the exclusionary rule to suppress evidence obtained as a result of\n                nonculpable, innocent police conduct.\u201d Id. at ___, 131 S. Ct. at 2428-29.\n\u00b6 28\n\u00b6 29        Thus, if it can be said in the present case that \u201cbinding appellate precedent\u201d existed on\n       April 23, 2009, allowing for warrantless GPS use when Detective Shufelt installed the device,\n       then Davis controls without a doubt and the exclusionary rule does not apply. However, even if\n       it could be concluded that \u201cbinding appellate precedent\u201d did not exist in this case, it would not\n       end the inquiry. It would still be necessary to conduct the \u201cgood-faith inquiry\u201d and consider\n       \u201cwhether a reasonably well trained officer would have known that the search was illegal in\n       light of all of the circumstances.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Herring, 555 U.S. at 145.\n       Clearly, application of the good-faith inquiry is not limited to the specific circumstances\n       addressed by the Supreme Court in Davis or any other Supreme Court case. Stephens, 764 F.3d\n       at 336. The Supreme Court has found the exclusionary rule to be inapplicable in a variety of\n\n\n                                                    -7-\n\f       settings after undertaking the good-faith analysis, and the fact that a court might apply the\n       good-faith exception in a new context not yet addressed by the Supreme Court does not mean\n       that it is creating a \u201cnew, freestanding exception\u201d to the exclusionary rule. Id. at 336 n.10; see\n       also Davis, 564 U.S. at ___, 131 S. Ct. at 2428 (noting that \u201c[t]he Court has over time applied\n       this \u2018good-faith\u2019 exception across a range of cases\u201d).\n\n\u00b6 30                     III. Exclusionary Rule Does Not Apply for Three Reasons\n\u00b6 31       We find that application of the exclusionary rule to this case is not appropriate for three\n       reasons. First, the exclusionary rule does not apply because at the time of Detective Shufelt\u2019s\n       conduct in April 2009, the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in Knotts and Karo were\n       \u201cbinding appellate precedent\u201d that he could have reasonably relied upon. Second, we find in\n       the alternative that, pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s general good-faith analysis, the police\n       conduct in relying on the legal landscape that existed at the time was objectively reasonable\n       and a reasonable officer had no reason to suspect that his conduct was wrongful under the\n       circumstances. And third, this case fits squarely within the specific holding of Davis, because\n       United States v. Garcia, 474 F.3d 994, 996-97 (7th Cir. 2007), was binding precedent as far as\n       the Aurora police detective was concerned and he stood in exactly the same shoes as the\n       Alabama police officer in Davis that relied upon binding Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals\n       precedent when he conducted a search in the course of investigating a state law traffic offense.\n       Accordingly, suppression of the evidence is not warranted for each of these reasons.\n\n\u00b6 32                      IV. Knotts and Karo Were Binding Appellate Precedent\n\u00b6 33       There is no question that decisions of the United States Supreme Court interpreting fourth\n       amendment law are binding precedent for Illinois police officers and Illinois courts. We\n       conclude that the Supreme Court cases of Knotts and Karo clearly authorized the police\n       conduct in this case. Even though the underlying facts of those cases differ from the facts of the\n       present case, it is the rationale that underlies those cases that is relevant to our discussion. See\n       Katzin, 769 F.3d at 173-74; Stephens, 764 F.3d at 337-38.\n\u00b6 34       In Knotts, the police were investigating suspects relative to a conspiracy to manufacture\n       illegal drugs. Knotts, 460 U.S. at 278. The police arranged for one of the suspects to voluntarily\n       take into his vehicle a container of chloroform that, unbeknownst to the suspect, contained a\n       beeper. By tracking the signals emitted from the beeper, police were able to locate it at\n       defendant\u2019s secluded manufacturing site. The defendant sought to suppress the evidence that\n       was obtained as a result of the warrantless monitoring of the beeper. The Supreme Court held\n       that the use of the beeper to track a vehicle was not a search under the fourth amendment. Id. at\n       285. The Court explained that \u201c[a] person traveling in an automobile on public thoroughfares\n       has no reasonable expectation of privacy in his movements from one place to another,\u201d and the\n       beeper simply revealed what could have been seen by the public through visual surveillance\n       and it made no difference that the officers\u2019 \u201csensory faculties\u201d were augmented by its use. Id.\n       at 281, 282.\n\u00b6 35       In Karo, the defendant ordered 50 gallons of ether (for use in cocaine smuggling) from an\n       informant. Karo, 468 U.S. at 708. After obtaining the informant\u2019s consent, federal agents\n       substituted one of the informant\u2019s cans of ether with its own can, which contained a beeper.\n       Defendant bought the can and took it into his car. For the next several months, the agents\n\n\n                                                    -8-\n\f       monitored the beeper to determine the location of the ether. One of the questions presented\n       before the Supreme Court was whether the warrantless installation of the beeper was legal. Id.\n       at 711.\n\u00b6 36       The Court in Karo concluded that the warrantless installation of the beeper did not violate\n       the fourth amendment. Id. at 713. The Court found that the transfer of the can with the beeper\n       did not convey any information, and although there was a potential that the defendant\u2019s privacy\n       could be invaded, the transfer itself infringed no privacy interest. Id. at 712. Moreover, the\n       Court found that the transfer was not a seizure despite the \u201ctechnical trespass on the space\n       occupied by the beeper,\u201d which the Court referred to as \u201cunknown and unwanted foreign\n       object.\u201d Id. The Court then proceeded to \u201cbroadly discredit[ ] the relevance of trespass in the\n       context of electronic surveillance of vehicles: \u2018[A] physical trespass is only marginally\n       relevant to the question of whether the Fourth Amendment has been violated, ... for an actual\n       trespass is neither necessary nor sufficient to establish a constitutional violation.\u2019 \u201d Katzin, 769\n       F.3d at 175 (quoting Karo, 468 U.S. at 712-13); see also Aguiar, 737 F.3d at 261 (also noting\n       that Karo discounted the importance of trespass in placing a tracking device).\n\u00b6 37       As the Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, explained in Aguiar:\n               \u201cKaro\u2019s de minimis treatment of the trespass issue gave no indication that the issue of\n               trespass would become the touchstone for the analysis in Jones. Moreover, Karo\u2019s\n               brushing off of the potential trespass fits logically with earlier Supreme Court decisions\n               concluding that \u2018the physical characteristics of an automobile and its use result in a\n               lessened expectation of privacy therein.\u2019 \u201d Aguiar, 737 F.3d at 261 (quoting New York\n               v. Class, 475 U.S. 106, 112 (1986) (to examine the exterior of an automobile does not\n               constitute a search)).\n       See also Cardwell v. Lewis, 417 U.S. 583, 591 (1974) (plurality opinion) (warrantless taking of\n       paint scrapings from the exterior of a vehicle does not constitute an unlawful search). 1\n\u00b6 38       We conclude that it was objectively reasonable for the police to rely upon Knotts and Karo\n       for the conclusion that warrantless installation and monitoring of the GPS device was legal.\n       We acknowledge that the facts are different here, but again it was reasonable for Detective\n       Shufelt to rely upon the legal principles set forth by the Supreme Court. Here, police monitored\n       the movement of the Kia by GPS not by a beeper signal. But there is no legally significant\n       difference between the two technologies, and in both cases the devices were \u201cunknown and\n       unwanted objects.\u201d Moreover, the police surreptitiously affixed a GPS device to the underside\n       of the Kia\u2019s bumper rather than surreptitiously \u201ctricking him into unwittingly taking the GPS\n       device into his vehicle,\u201d but otherwise the conduct of law enforcement here \u201cechoed that in\n       Knotts and Karo.\u201d Katzin, 769 F.3d at 176. Just like in Karo, the attachment of the GPS device\n       did not itself convey any information or infringe any privacy interest apart from its use.\n\u00b6 39       We fully agree with the conclusion reached by the United States Court of Appeals, Third\n       Circuit, in its en banc decision in Katzin in considering the same issue under the identical facts\n\n           1\n            It must be recognized that there would have been no merit to any argument raised before Jones that\n       a physical trespass to private property, standing alone, would constitute a search. See, e.g., Florida v.\n       Riley, 488 U.S. 445, 459 n.3 (1989) (noting that Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 351 (1967), \u201cmade\n       plain that the question whether or not the disputed evidence had been procured by means of a trespass\n       was irrelevant\u201d).\n\n                                                       -9-\n\f       presented here: \u201cIt would have been objectively reasonable for a law enforcement officer to\n       conclude that Karo\u2019s sweeping rejection of the trespass theory applied not only to the [federal]\n       agents\u2019 elaborate ruse therein, but also to the unremarkable strategy of magnetically attaching\n       a battery-operated GPS unit onto the exterior of a vehicle. In sum *** the Supreme Court\u2019s\n       rationale was broad enough to embrace the agents\u2019 conduct, and their reliance on this binding\n       appellate precedent was objectively reasonable under Davis.\u201d Katzin, 769 F.3d at 175.\n\n\u00b6 40                   V. Conclusion That Knotts and Karo Are Binding Precedent\n                          for Pre-Jones GPS Searches Is Supported by All of the\n                        Federal Court of Appeals Decisions to Address the Issue\n\u00b6 41       In the aftermath of Jones, all of the federal circuit court of appeals decisions to directly\n       consider whether Knotts and/or Karo are binding appellate precedent under Davis\u2014so that\n       evidence obtained through warrantless GPS installation and use pre-Jones should not be\n       excluded\u2014have answered the question in the affirmative and have applied the good-faith\n       exception. See United States v. Katzin, 769 F.3d 163, 173-75 (3d Cir. 2014); United States v.\n       Stephens, 764 F.3d 327, 338 (4th Cir. 2014); United States v. Aguiar, 737 F.3d 251, 261-62 (2d\n       Cir. 2013); see also United States v. Brown, 744 F.3d 474, 478 (7th Cir. 2014) (finding Knotts\n       and Karo are binding appellate precedent for purposes of consensual GPS installation and\n       subsequent monitoring; and stating that \u201call of the extant appellate precedent is on the side of\n       applying Davis[\u2019s]\u201d good-faith exception to all nonconsensual searches conducted pre-Jones\n       as well, and doubting the deterrent benefit of prohibiting police from relying on out-of-circuit\n       authority just because a particular circuit lacks its own authority); United States v. Sparks, 711\n       F.3d 58, 65, 67 (1st Cir. 2013). 2 Thus, the First, Second, Third and Fourth Circuits all clearly\n       hold that Knotts and/or Karo are binding appellate precedent for purposes of Davis.\n       Additionally, many of the other circuits will likely not have much opportunity to address this\n       precise point because they already had decided cases before Jones was decided, holding that\n       warrantless attachment and use of a GPS device on a suspect\u2019s vehicle was acceptable under\n       Knotts and/or Karo. Consequently, there would be no need to consider Knotts and Karo\n       specifically as supporting application of the good-faith exception where their own circuit\n       precedent had already existed. See, e.g., United States v. Hernandez, 647 F.3d 216, 220-21 (5th\n       Cir. 2011) (relying on Knotts and its own prior precedent on beepers to hold that warrantless\n       GPS attachment and monitoring was not a search in a case decided before Jones); United\n       States v. Garcia, 474 F.3d 994, 996-97 (7th Cir. 2007) (same holding that warrantless GPS\n       installation and use was not a search); United States v. Marquez, 605 F.3d 604, 610 (8th Cir.\n       2010) (GPS installation and use requires only reasonable suspicion, not a warrant); United\n       States v. Pineda-Moreno, 591 F.3d 1212, 1215-17 (9th Cir. 2010) (GPS installation and use is\n       not a search); United States v. McIver, 186 F.3d 1119, 1126-27 (9th Cir. 1999) (holding that\n       GPS installation was not a search); United States v. Smith, 387 F. App\u2019x 918, 921 (11th Cir.\n       2010) (per curiam) (installation of a GPS device did not violate the fourth amendment because\n       the defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the exterior of his vehicle). There is,\n           2\n            Sparks also relied upon its own pre-Jones precedent in United States v. Moore, 562 F.2d 106 (1st\n       Cir. 1977), a case decided years before Knotts. Sparks did not delineate where its reliance on Knotts\n       ended and its reliance on Moore began, but Sparks relied upon Knotts as binding appellate precedent for\n       the same reasons we do. See Sparks, 711 F.3d at 65-67.\n\n                                                     - 10 -\n\f       then, nearly a clean sweep across the federal circuits holding that Knotts and Karo are\n       controlling precedent for GPS searches pre-Jones, and there is not any definitive authority to\n       the contrary. Cf. United States v. Maynard, 615 F.3d 544 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (holding only that\n       prolonged use of a GPS device, for 28 days, violated the fourth amendment, a question it\n       considered specifically reserved by Knotts).\n\u00b6 42       The first of several such cases to squarely address, after Jones and Davis, the issue of\n       whether Knotts and Karo can be considered binding precedent for GPS searches conducted\n       before Jones was the Second Circuit\u2019s decision in United States v. Aguiar, which we have\n       already quoted above. It will suffice to note that Aguiar unequivocally held that Knotts and\n       Karo were binding precedent at the time police installed the GPS device on January 23, 2009,\n       and then used it for the next 11 days. Aguiar, 737 F.3d at 261. Aguiar concluded that those\n       cases were sufficient precedent for police to reasonably conclude that a warrant was not\n       necessary. Id. In reaching this conclusion, the court noted that all of the circuits to consider\n       warrantless GPS installation pre-Jones had concluded the same, and that no unsettling\n       authority existed among the circuits until at least August 2010 when the District of Columbia\n       Circuit in Maynard, 615 F.3d at 565, found only that prolonged use of GPS tracking for 28\n       days, 24 hours a day, violated the fourth amendment. 3 Aguiar further noted its conclusion that\n       the officers relied in good faith on Knotts in placing the GPS device on the defendant\u2019s vehicle\n       was reinforced by the fact that many of its sister circuits had reached similar results. Aguiar,\n       737 F.3d at 262. The court further noted that \u201c[t]hese [out-of-circuit] cases are not binding\n       precedent and thus do not control our analysis ***, but do support the conclusion that relying\n       on Knotts was objectively reasonable.\u201d Id. 4\n\u00b6 43       The next United States Court of Appeals decision to address whether Knotts and Karo are\n       binding precedent for GPS searches pre-Jones was rendered by the Fourth Circuit in United\n       States v. Stephens, 764 F.3d 327 (4th Cir. 2014). In Stephens, federal and state law\n       enforcement officers in the Baltimore area were investigating the defendant, a convicted felon,\n       for possible drug and firearm charges. On May 13, 2011, a Baltimore police officer, acting\n       without a warrant, placed a GPS device under the rear bumper of the defendant\u2019s vehicle.\n       Three days later, Baltimore city police tracked defendant in the vehicle. When the defendant\n       arrived at his destination, the officers searched the vehicle and found a loaded handgun. The\n       defendant was charged with state law crimes and remained in state custody for about three\n       months, until a federal grand jury indicted the defendant on a federal firearm charge. The State\n\n           3\n             This was the case taken up by the Supreme Court, now captioned United States v. Jones, 565 U.S.\n       ___, 132 S. Ct. 945 (2012), which brought forth a \u201ctectonic shift\u201d in the legal landscape, to hold that the\n       installation and use of the GPS device was an illegal search because of the trespass to the vehicle\u2019s\n       exterior. In Maynard, the defendant apparently thought any question as to a possible trespass due to the\n       attachment of the GPS was so well settled that he did not raise it. Moreover, Maynard rested its holding\n       on the prolonged surveillance (28 days duration), a question it considered left open by Knotts.\n       Maynard, 615 F.3d at 558.\n           4\n             Aguiar stated that in the aftermath of Jones, there was a split in the circuits, as United States v.\n       Katzin, 732 F.3d 187, 210 (3d Cir. 2013), \u201cadopted a much stricter rule\u201d declining to apply the\n       good-faith exception because Knotts and Karo were distinguishable based on the lack of physical\n       intrusion in those cases. Aguiar, 737 F.3d at 260. However, the Third Circuit granted rehearing en banc\n       in Katzin, vacated its previous decision, and instead held that Knotts and Karo were indeed binding\n       appellate precedent under Davis.\n\n                                                       - 11 -\n\f       of Maryland dismissed the charges after the federal indictment. Id. at 330. The cause then\n       proceeded in federal court. Defendant then filed a motion to suppress based on Jones, which\n       was denied by the district court. Id.\n\u00b6 44        The Fourth Circuit in Stephens affirmed the denial of the suppression motion. Id. at 339. In\n       so doing, it began by rejecting the defendant\u2019s narrow view of the good-faith inquiry. Id. at\n       337. It noted that \u201cDavis merely establishes the inapplicability of the exclusionary rule in one\n       specific circumstance. Davis does not, however, alter the general good-faith inquiry which, we\n       reiterate, requires consideration of whether a reasonably well-trained officer would have\n       known that a search was illegal in light of all of the circumstances.\u201d Id. The court then stated\n       that in May 2011, when the search was conducted, which was before Jones, neither the\n       Supreme Court nor the Fourth Circuit had expressly approved or disapproved of warrantless\n       GPS usage. Id. It then noted that Knotts was \u201cnot exactly on point.\u201d Id. But that it was\n       \u201c \u2018widely and reasonably understood to stand for the proposition that the Fourth Amendment\n       simply was not implicated by electronic surveillance of public automotive movements\u2019\n       [citation], and it was the \u2018foundational Supreme Court precedent for GPS-related cases\u2019\n       [citation].\u201d Id. at 338. The court continued: \u201cAfter Jones, we know that such an interpretation\n       of Knotts is incorrect. Without the benefit of hindsight, however, and with no contrary\n       guidance from the Supreme Court or this Court, we believe that a reasonably well-trained\n       officer in this Circuit could have relied upon Knotts as permitting the type of warrantless GPS\n       usage in this case.\u201d Id.\n\u00b6 45        The Stephens court found its conclusion to be undergirded by Maryland state law precedent\n       (see Kelly, 82 A.3d at 216) holding that Knotts was binding appellate court precedent in\n       Maryland under Davis, and therefore, \u201cMaryland police officers could \u2018reasonably rely on\n       Knotts, pre-Jones, in affixing a GPS tracking device to the vehicle of a person under their\n       investigation for the purpose of conducting surveillance.\u2019 \u201d Stephens, 764 F.3d at 338. The\n       court noted that the fact that defendant was later charged federally did not alter its\n       determination. Id. The court then rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that Maryland state law\n       was irrelevant because the investigation was federal. Id. at 338 n.13. The court further noted\n       that it was a joint state and federal investigation. Id. Moreover, the court observed that \u201c \u2018in the\n       initial stages of a criminal investigation, it may be anything but clear whether the conduct\n       being investigated violates state law, federal law, or both,\u2019 [citation] and \u2018the decision with\n       respect to the court in which charges are to be brought is often made by the Office of the United\n       States Attorney and the state prosecutor, not the investigating officer,\u2019 [citation].\u201d Id.\n\u00b6 46        The most recent federal court of appeals case to hold that Knotts and Karo are \u201cbinding\n       appellate precedent\u201d under Davis is United States v. Katzin, 769 F.3d 163 (3d Cir. 2014)\n       (decided en banc on rehearing), where the court conducted an excellent and exhaustive\n       analysis of the issues. In Katzin, local police officers and the FBI were investigating a series of\n       burglaries of pharmacies in the greater Philadelphia area. Id. at 167. On December 13, 2010,\n       officers attached a GPS device to the undercarriage of defendant\u2019s van while it was parked on\n       a public street. Two days later the van was tracked to a certain pharmacy that was burglarized\n       at the time defendant\u2019s van was there. The defendant was eventually pulled over by state police\n       and defendant was found with items consistent with the burglary of the pharmacy. Id. at 168\n\n\n\n\n                                                    - 12 -\n\f\u00b6 47       For the same reasons noted above, Katzin found Knotts and Karo to be binding precedent\n       under Davis and law enforcement\u2019s reliance upon it to be objectively reasonable. Additionally,\n       Katzin rejected a narrow reading of Davis by noting the following:\n               \u201c[I]f binding appellate precedent specifically authorizes the precise conduct under\n               consideration, then it will likely be binding appellate precedent *** under Davis.\n               However, this does not make the reverse syllogism true, namely, that if a case is\n               binding appellate precedent under Davis, then it must specifically authorize the precise\n               conduct under consideration. Davis\u2019 holding is broader: \u2018[e]vidence obtained during a\n               search conducted in reasonable reliance on binding precedent is not subject to the\n               exclusionary rule.\u2019 [Citation.] While reliance is likely reasonable when the precise\n               conduct under consideration has been affirmatively authorized by binding appellate\n               precedent, it may be no less reasonable when the conduct under consideration clearly\n               falls well within rationale espoused in binding appellate precedent, which authorizes\n               nearly identical conduct.\n                   Accordingly, what is far more important to our conclusion is that, despite these few\n               dissimilarities [i.e., clandestinely installing a GPS to the exterior of the van rather than\n               clandestinely tricking him into unwittingly taking the beeper device into his vehicle],\n               the agents\u2019 nearly identical conduct fits squarely within the rationale of these\n               decisions.\u201d Id. at 176.\n\u00b6 48       Katzin then found in the alternative that even if the factual dissimilarities somehow\n       disqualified Knotts and Karo from being binding precedent, which could be reasonably relied\n       upon under Davis, the inquiry would not end there. Katzin noted that Davis was \u201cbut one\n       application of the good faith exception,\u201d although undoubtedly the most analogous one. Id. at\n       177. Katzin further noted that \u201c[e]ven where Davis does not control, it is our duty to consider\n       the totality of the circumstances to answer the objectively ascertainable question whether a\n       reasonably well trained officer would have known that the search was illegal.\u201d (Internal\n       quotation marks omitted.) Id. It further explained that:\n               \u201cDavis did not begin, nor end, with binding appellate precedent. Rather, binding\n               appellate precedent informed\u2014and ultimately determined\u2014the Supreme Court\u2019s\n               greater inquiry: whether the officers\u2019 conduct was deliberate and culpable enough that\n               application of the exclusionary rule would \u2018yield meaningful[l] deterrence,\u2019 and \u2018be\n               worth the price paid by the justice system.\u2019 [Citation.] We must conduct the same\n               analysis on the facts before us, even in the absence of binding appellate precedent.\u201d Id.\n               at 178.\n\u00b6 49       Katzin then reviewed the legal landscape as it existed at the time law enforcement installed\n       the GPS device in December 2010, which included Knotts and Karo and several out-of-circuit\n       decisions specifically upholding warrantless GPS installation and tracking. The court found\n       that \u201c[g]iven the panoply of authority authorizing their actions, we cannot conclude that a\n       \u2018reasonably well trained officer would have known that the search was illegal,\u2019 [citation] nor\n       that the agents acted with a \u2018deliberate, reckless, or grossly negligent disregard for\n       [Appellees\u2019] Fourth Amendment rights,\u2019 [citation].\u201d Id. at 184.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    - 13 -\n\f\u00b6 50                          VI. Objectively Reasonable Good-Faith Belief\n\u00b6 51       This brings us to our second reason for holding that the exclusionary rule is inapplicable\n       under the circumstances. We find in the alternative, as the court did in Katzin, that, pursuant to\n       the Supreme Court\u2019s general good-faith analysis, the detective\u2019s conduct, in relying on the\n       legal landscape that existed at the time the search was conducted, was objectively reasonable,\n       and he had no reason to suspect that his conduct was wrongful under the circumstances.\n       Therefore, the exclusionary rule cannot be invoked here. It simply cannot be applied to a\n       situation where it offers little or no deterrent benefit and where there is not the least bit of\n       culpability that can be charged to the officer\u2019s conduct in conducting a warrantless GPS search\n       in 2009.\n\u00b6 52       As noted, \u201cwhen the police act with an objectively reasonable good-faith belief that their\n       conduct is lawful ***, the deterrence rationale loses much of its force, and exclusion cannot\n       pay its way.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Davis, 564 U.S. at ___, 131 S. Ct. at 2427-28\n       (quoting Leon, 468 U.S. at 907 n.6). We have already discussed the rationale of Knotts and\n       Karo and how they were widely and reasonably understood to stand for the proposition that the\n       fourth amendment was simply not implicated by electronic surveillance of automotive\n       movements. Moreover, Karo\u2019s \u201cbrushing off\u201d and \u201cdiscount[ing]\u201d of the trespass theory\n       meshed logically with earlier Supreme Court decisions concluding that the physical\n       characteristics of an automobile and its use result in a lessened expectation of privacy.\n       Additionally, it must be conceded that there would have been no merit to any argument raised\n       prior to Jones that a physical trespass to the private property of a vehicle\u2019s exterior would have\n       constituted a search. See supra \u00b6 37 n.1. When all of this is combined with the fact that there\n       was no contrary federal circuit court or Illinois precedent in existence\u2014but rather all of the\n       federal court of appeals authority was in agreement, including the Seventh Circuit, one of the\n       jurisdictions in which the police officers in this case operated, specifically having concluded\n       that warrantless installation and use of a GPS device did not violate the fourth amendment\n       (Garcia, 474 F.3d at 996-98; McIver, 186 F.3d at 1126-27)\u2014then the circumstances are\n       overwhelmingly in favor of concluding that suppression is not warranted here.\n\u00b6 53       Given the state of the law with which police officers were faced in 2009, there is no merit\n       to defendant\u2019s intimation that the police in this case were risking that their conduct would be\n       held unconstitutional. To characterize the officer\u2019s conduct in such a manner is simply not a\n       fair assessment in view of the legal landscape.\n\u00b6 54       There is also no merit to the notion that the good-faith exception may never be applied in a\n       state prosecution where local police reasonably rely upon the legal landscape in existence but\n       there are no state law cases addressing the issue. \u201cNothing in Davis itself supports such an\n       interpretation.\u201d Stephens, 764 F.3d at 337; see also Brown, 744 F.3d at 478 (questioning\n       whether there is any deterrence to be gained by telling police they may not \u201crely on decisions\n       issued by several circuits, just because the circuit covering the state in which an investigation is\n       ongoing lacks its own precedent\u201d). And none of the Supreme Court precedent cited by the\n       parties supports the idea that police may not rely upon the \u201c \u2018constitutional norm\u2019 \u201d that has\n       been established by the legal landscape. See Katzin, 769 F.3d at 184 (quoting United States v.\n       Peltier, 422 U.S. 531, 542 (1975) (where the Court considered the \u201cconstitutional norm\u201d\n       established by the court of appeals when determining whether an officer \u201chad knowledge, or\n       [could] properly be charged with knowledge, that the search was unconstitutional under the\n\n\n                                                    - 14 -\n\f       Fourth Amendment\u201d)).\n\n\u00b6 55                    VII. Garcia Was Binding Appellate Precedent Under Davis\n\u00b6 56       The third major point supporting our holding is that for purposes of Davis\u2019s good-faith\n       inquiry, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals decision in United States v. Garcia, 474 F.3d\n       994 (7th Cir. 2007), was \u201cbinding appellate precedent\u201d for Illinois police officers that they\n       could have reasonably relied upon in 2009. In Garcia, the defendant was a convicted felon who\n       had served time for methamphetamine offenses. Id. at 995. Shortly after his release from\n       prison, police received a tip from an informant that the defendant was selling meth and wanted\n       to start manufacturing it again. The police located defendant\u2019s vehicle and secretly placed a\n       GPS device underneath the rear bumper. Evidence was subsequently gathered as a result of the\n       GPS tracking that showed that defendant had resumed the manufacture of the illegal drug. Id.\n       at 995-96. Garcia specifically rejected the contention that the warrantless installation of the\n       GPS device violated the fourth amendment. Id. at 996-98. The court held that \u201c[t]he\n       defendant\u2019s contention that by attaching the *** tracking device the police seized his car is\n       untenable.\u201d Id. at 996. And there is no search in the attachment either. Id. at 996-97. In so\n       holding, Garcia stated the following:\n                \u201cBut if police follow a car around, or observe its route by means of cameras mounted\n                on lampposts or of satellite imaging as in Google Earth, there is no search. Well, but the\n                tracking in this case was by satellite. Instead of transmitting images, the satellite\n                transmitted geophysical coordinates. The only difference is that in the imaging case\n                nothing touches the vehicle, while in the case at hand the tracking device does. But it is\n                a distinction without any practical difference.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id. at 997.\n       Thus, Garcia specifically authorized the police practice of attaching a GPS device to a vehicle\n       without a warrant in the Seventh Circuit, which geographically includes Illinois.\n\u00b6 57       Illinois law enforcement\u2019s reliance upon Garcia fits squarely within the specific holding of\n       Davis, because it was \u201cbinding appellate precedent\u201d in the absence of any contrary Illinois\n       state authority as far as the Aurora police detective was concerned, who stood in exactly the\n       same shoes as the Alabama police officer in Davis that relied upon binding Eleventh Circuit\n       Court of Appeals precedent when he conducted a search in the course of investigating a state\n       law traffic offense. Accordingly, suppression of the evidence is not warranted.\n\u00b6 58       In Davis, local police officers in Greenville, Alabama, conducted a routine traffic stop that\n       resulted in the arrest of the defendant, the driver of the vehicle, for a state DUI offense. Davis,\n       564 U.S. at ___, 131 S. Ct. at 2425. The defendant was handcuffed by police and placed in the\n       back of the squad car. Id. at ___, 131 S. Ct. at 2425. Police then searched the passenger\n       compartment of the vehicle and found a gun in the defendant\u2019s jacket. Id. at ___, 131 S. Ct. at\n       2425. Defendant was ultimately prosecuted in federal court on a firearm charge. Id. at ___, 131\n       S. Ct. at 2425-26.\n\u00b6 59       Even after a defendant has stepped out of the vehicle and has been subdued by police, the\n       prevailing understanding among courts was that New York v. Belton, 453 U.S. 454 (1981), had\n       set down a bright-line rule, authorizing searches incident to arrest regardless of the location of\n       the arrestee at the time of the search. Davis, 564 U.S. at ___, 131 S. Ct. at 2424. The federal\n       district court in Davis denied the motion to suppress based on Belton. However, while the case\n       was pending on appeal, the Supreme Court decided Arizona v. Gant, 556 U.S. 332 (2009),\n\n                                                   - 15 -\n\f       which upset the prevailing interpretation of Belton. Before Gant, the Eleventh Circuit had been\n       one of many federal appeals courts to read Belton permissively so as to allow searches of the\n       vehicle even after the suspects were handcuffed and placed under arrest. See United States v.\n       Gonzalez, 71 F.3d 819, 822 (11th Cir. 1996) (allowing search pursuant to Belton where the\n       suspect was already arrested and handcuffed). When the Davis case reached the Supreme\n       Court, it consequently became necessary to resolve the question of \u201cwhether to apply the\n       exclusionary rule when the police *** [rely upon] binding judicial precedent.\u201d Davis, 564 U.S.\n       at ___, 131 S. Ct. at 2428.\n\u00b6 60       As noted, the Supreme Court found the Eleventh Circuit precedent in Gonzalez to be\n       \u201cbinding appellate precedent\u201d for the local Alabama police officers who were conducting a\n       routine traffic stop and investigating a purely state traffic offense when they decided to\n       conduct a search in objectively reasonable reliance upon Gonzalez. 5 Davis, 564 U.S. at ___,\n       131 S. Ct. at 2428. As we have emphasized throughout this opinion, absolutely crucial to the\n       decision in Davis was the lack of police culpability. It is hard to fathom, then, how the Aurora\n       police officer in the present case\u2014who could have reasonably relied upon Garcia as a case\n       directly on point, which was followed to \u201cthe letter\u201d\u2014could be considered to be in any\n       different position than the Alabama officers in Davis, who relied upon Gonzalez, which was\n       followed to the letter. There appears to be no principled basis on which to distinguish Davis\n       from the present case, and defendant has not offered one.\n\u00b6 61       The only reason defendant offers for not applying the good-faith exception based on\n       reliance upon Garcia is that in the present case, \u201c[t]here is no indication in the record that\n       police were doing anything other than investigating a state offense, and [defendant] was\n       ultimately charged in state court.\u201d But that is the exact same situation as Davis, where state\n       police officers were investigating a state crime they had no reason to believe would be\n       prosecuted in federal court. As Davis itself shows, in the initial stages of a criminal\n       investigation, it is not clear whether the conduct being investigated will end up supporting a\n       violation of state law, federal law, or both. Moreover, the decision as to which court to bring\n       the charges, federal or state, is almost certainly never made by the investigating officer. See\n       Stephens, 764 F.3d at 338 n.13. Surely, the decision in Davis cannot be read to rest on the\n       fortuitous and conceptually irrelevant distinction that\u2014after the search was already\n       undertaken and without knowing what it would produce\u2014Davis\u2019s weapon charge could be\n       prosecuted in federal court whereas the robbery charge here could not. We decline the\n       invitation to presume that the Supreme Court intended such an absurd result.\n\u00b6 62       As a final matter, we address the dissent\u2019s claim that we have made a \u201cdeeply troubling\n       departure\u201d from the holding in People v. Krueger, 175 Ill. 2d 60 (1996), and People v.\n       Madison, 121 Ill. 2d 195 (1988), by recognizing the good-faith exception of Davis. The dissent\n       is clearly mistaken in its belief that Krueger and Madison are at odds with the outcome in the\n       present case.\n\u00b6 63       In Krueger, this court first addressed the constitutionality of an Illinois statute that allowed\n       police to enter a home without first knocking and announcing their office where a warrant had\n           5\n            At the time the Alabama police officers conducted their search of the vehicle in Davis, the\n       Alabama Supreme Court had not specifically addressed the location of the arrestee at the time of arrest.\n       See Gundrum v. State, 563 So. 2d 27, 28 (Ala. Crim. App. 1990) (noting that its state supreme court had\n       not addressed the issue).\n\n                                                     - 16 -\n\f       been issued pursuant to the no-knock provision contained in the statute. Specifically, the\n       statute allowed a no-knock entry if the occupant of the building had possessed a firearm\n       \u201cwithin a reasonable time period.\u201d People v. Krueger, 175 Ill. 2d at 64; 725 ILCS\n       5/108-8(b)(2) (West 1994). This court began by noting that the search and seizure clauses of\n       both the federal and state constitutions should be measured using the same standard. Krueger,\n       175 Ill. 2d at 65 (which held that any variance between the Supreme Court\u2019s construction of\n       the fourth amendment and similar provisions in the Illinois Constitution must be based on\n       language in our state constitution, or the debates or committee reports of the constitutional\n       convention, that indicate that the provisions of our state constitution are intended to be\n       construed differently than the provisions of the federal constitution after which they are\n       patterned) (citing People v. Tisler, 103 Ill. 2d 226, 235-36 (1984)). Relying upon Wilson v.\n       Arkansas, 514 U.S. 927 (1995), and People v. Condon, 148 Ill. 2d 96, 101 (1992), Krueger\n       found that although a no-knock entry can be constitutionally permitted if exigent\n       circumstances are present, simple possession of firearms by the occupant without more does\n       not qualify. Krueger rejected the argument that it would decrease the danger to officers to\n       dispense with the usual requirements of knocking and announcing. Krueger, 175 Ill. 2d at\n       67-68. This court noted that in a situation where the occupant is not known to be violent, it\n       might actually increase the risk of harm to the officers when the occupant is threatened by a\n       completely unexpected and unannounced entry. Id. at 68-69.\n\u00b6 64        After finding that the statutory provision in question was unconstitutional, Krueger then\n       turned to the question of whether the evidence seized from the defendant\u2019s home pursuant to\n       the unconstitutional statute should be excluded from trial. The State urged this court to adopt\n       Illinois v. Krull, 480 U.S. 340 (1987), where the Supreme Court applied the good-faith\n       exception to the exclusionary rule in the specific instance of a police officer having relied, in\n       good faith, on a statute that authorized a warrantless administrative search, but the statute was\n       later declared unconstitutional. Krueger, 175 Ill. 2d at 70-71. Krueger recognized that Krull\n       was controlling as a matter of federal constitutional law, but Krueger nevertheless held that\n       \u201cthe exclusionary rule arising out of our state constitution (Ill. Const. 1970, art. I, \u00a7 6)\n       continues to afford the protection abrogated by Krull.\u201d Id. at 73-74.\n\u00b6 65        In departing from the lockstep doctrine of following Supreme Court decisions in fourth\n       amendment cases, Krueger referred to this state\u2019s particular history with respect to the\n       exclusionary rule\u2019s application to evidence obtained under an unconstitutional statute:\n                \u201c[Our] exclusionary rule has always been understood to bar evidence gathered under\n                the authority of an unconstitutional statute (see Brocamp, 307 Ill. 448, (adopting the\n                reasoning in Weeks for purposes of our state exclusionary rule); Weeks, 232 U.S. at\n                394, 58 L. Ed. at 656, 34 S. Ct. at 345 (making it clear that the federal exclusionary rule\n                was intended to apply to evidence gathered by officers acting under \u2018legislative ***\n                sanction\u2019)), so long as that statute purported to authorize an unconstitutional search or\n                seizure (see Michigan v. DeFillippo, 443 U.S. 31, 61 L. Ed. 2d 343, 99 S. Ct. 2627\n                (1979) (recognizing a substantive-procedural distinction not at issue here; specifically\n                holding that the fourth amendment exclusionary rule did not apply where an ordinance\n                was held unconstitutional on vagueness grounds)). Consequently, to adopt Krull\u2019s\n                extended good-faith exception would drastically change this state\u2019s constitutional\n                law.\u201d Id. at 74-75.\n\n\n                                                    - 17 -\n\f\u00b6 66        From the foregoing, it is crystal clear that Krueger held only that the good-faith exception\n       as expressed in Krull\u2014which dealt only with an officer\u2019s reliance upon a statute later declared\n       unconstitutional\u2014would not be recognized in Illinois for purposes of our state constitution.\n       Krueger therefore has no application to the present case where an officer could have\n       reasonably relied in objective good faith on binding appellate judicial decisions and the\n       constitutional norm that had been established thereby. This is further borne out by Krueger\u2019s\n       heavy reliance upon Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s dissenting opinion in Krull arguing that \u201c \u2018the core\n       concern\u2019 \u201d of the framers of the fourth amendment was the enactment of unconstitutional\n       statutes by the legislative branch. Id. at 72 (quoting Krull, 480 U.S. at 362-63 (O\u2019Connor, J.,\n       dissenting, joined by Brennan, Marshall and Stevens, JJ.)). Krueger further noted that Justice\n       O\u2019Connor found this history illustrative of the fact that the relevant state actors in\n       Krull\u2014legislators\u2014often pose a serious threat to fourth amendment values and that this\n       presented a clear distinction from the situation in United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897 (1984),\n       where a judicial officer issues a warrant that is not supported by probable cause. Krueger, 175\n       Ill. 2d at 72. We find that the same threat to fourth amendment values that was of concern in\n       Krueger is not present when police reasonably rely in objective good faith on judicial\n       precedent. Nor is there any concern here of a \u201cgrace period\u201d giving effect to the operation of an\n       unconstitutional legislative act.\n\u00b6 67        Finally, Krueger expressly reaffirmed that this court would continue to accept both the\n       good-faith exception as expressed in Leon and the rationale used to support it. Notably,\n       Krueger did not imply that it would refuse to follow any further expansion or a different\n       articulation of the good-faith exception made by the Supreme Court in future cases.\n\u00b6 68        Given the actual rationale and holding of Krueger, it is no surprise that defendant did not\n       argue before this court that it controlled the outcome here. The dissent\u2019s treatment of it\n       obviously misses the mark.\n\u00b6 69        The same can be said for the dissent\u2019s unsolicited reliance upon Madison. In that case, the\n       plain language of the statute required police to obtain a warrant before searching and seizing\n       evidence discovered during an administrative inspection. Madison, 121 Ill. 2d at 201. The\n       Madison court noted that the problem with the State\u2019s argument for application of the\n       good-faith exception was that \u201c[t]he officers were acting in defiance of, not reliance on,\u201d the\n       plain words of the statute when they conducted their warrantless search and seizure. Id. at 208.\n       Such conduct cannot be considered objectively reasonable, and therefore the dissent\u2019s use of\n       Madison to support its position is puzzling. Madison would be instructive if, in the present\n       case, police had defied the plain language of an existing statute or judicial ruling and\n       substituted their own erroneous interpretation. But that of course is not the case here. In trying\n       to fit a square peg into a round hole, the dissent seems to purposely ignore that the good-faith\n       exception has an objective reasonableness component. See Davis, 564 U.S. at___, 131 S. Ct. at\n       2423-24 (\u201csearches conducted in objectively reasonable reliance on binding appellate\n       precedent are not subject to the exclusionary rule\u201d); see also Katzin, 769 F.3d at 176 (reliance\n       is reasonable \u201cwhen the conduct under consideration clearly falls within rationale espoused in\n       binding appellate precedent, which authorizes nearly identical conduct\u201d).\n\n\n\n\n                                                   - 18 -\n\f\u00b6 70                                         CONCLUSION\n\u00b6 71       We hold that the good-faith exception applies and that the evidence obtained against\n       defendant should not be excluded. We find Knotts, Karo and Garcia to be \u201cbinding appellate\n       precedent\u201d within the meaning of Davis and that Aurora police could have reasonably relied\n       upon such precedent in placing and using the GPS device in 2009. In the alternative, we further\n       find that it would have been objectively reasonable for police to rely upon the legal landscape\n       and the constitutional norm that had been established at the time of the search that allowed\n       warrantless attachment and use of GPS technology. In so doing, we conclude that there was a\n       complete lack of police culpability in this case and that there would be little or no deterrent\n       value to suppressing the evidence. At the same time, the cost to society of letting a clearly\n       guilty repeat offender go free is too great and the exclusionary rule cannot pay its way in this\n       case. Finally, we caution that after Jones law enforcement should beware of its holding and\n       how it relates to GPS attachment and monitoring.\n\u00b6 72       For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the appellate court\u2019s remand for a new trial because of\n       the Rule 401(a) violation. However, we reverse the portion of the appellate court\u2019s judgment\n       that vacated the trial court\u2019s order denying defendant\u2019s motion to quash arrest and suppress\n       evidence. We also reverse the portion of the appellate court\u2019s judgment that remanded the\n       cause for further proceedings on defendant\u2019s motion.\n\n\u00b6 73      Appellate court affirmed in part and reversed in part.\n\u00b6 74      Circuit court affirmed in part and reversed in part.\n\u00b6 75      Cause remanded.\n\n\u00b6 76       JUSTICE BURKE, dissenting:\n\u00b6 77       In a deeply troubling departure from this court\u2019s constitutional precedent, the majority now\n       recognizes for purposes of our state exclusionary rule the \u201cgood-faith\u201d exception to the federal\n       exclusionary rule set forth by the United States Supreme Court in Davis v. United States, 564\n       U.S. ___, 131 S. Ct. 2419 (2011). Under Davis, when, in good faith, the police conduct an\n       unconstitutional search based on their objectively reasonable reliance on \u201cbinding appellate\n       precedent\u201d which is later overruled, evidence resulting from the search is not subject to the\n       federal exclusionary rule. Id. at ___, 131 S. Ct. at 2423-24. Applying Davis to the facts before\n       this court, the majority holds that the good-faith exception applies because binding appellate\n       precedent at the time of the search authorized the warrantless installation of a GPS device on\n       the vehicle driven by defendant. Alternatively, the majority holds that the evidence obtained\n       from the GPS device is not subject to suppression because the police reasonably relied upon\n       persuasive, nonbinding precedent from other jurisdictions. In applying the good-faith\n       exception, the majority unfortunately chooses not to resolve the issue at the heart of this\n       case\u2014the constitutionality of warrantless GPS tracking of a suspect by the police.\n\u00b6 78       I disagree with the decision reached by the majority in several respects. First, the\n       majority\u2019s extension of the good-faith exception in Davis to our state exclusionary rule is\n       directly at odds with People v. Krueger, 175 Ill. 2d 60 (1996), where we refused to recognize a\n       good-faith exception for searches conducted in objectively reasonable reliance on a statute\n       which is later held to be unconstitutional. In Krueger, we held that the good-faith exception\n       was incompatible with the exclusionary rule arising out of our state constitution. We\n\n                                                  - 19 -\n\f       interpreted our exclusionary rule as providing greater protection of a citizen\u2019s right to be free\n       from unconstitutional searches and seizures than the federal exclusionary rule. Id. at 73-76. For\n       reasons similar to those set forth in Krueger, I would decline the State\u2019s request to recognize\n       the Davis good-faith exception for searches conducted in reasonable reliance on binding\n       appellate precedent.\n\u00b6 79       The majority\u2019s alternative holding, based on a broad reading of dicta in Davis, amply\n       demonstrates why this court should reject Davis as contrary to the Illinois exclusionary rule.\n       The majority goes well beyond the holding in Davis and finds that the good-faith exception\n       applies to searches conducted in the absence of any binding precedent where the police\n       reasonably rely on the prevailing \u201clegal landscape.\u201d The majority also invites the lower courts\n       to conduct a general \u201cgood-faith inquiry\u201d which is not limited to the specific circumstances in\n       Davis or any other Supreme Court case. By reading into Davis a much broader good-faith\n       exception than the one delineated in the Court\u2019s holding, the majority affords less protection to\n       the rights of Illinois citizens to be free from unconstitutional searches and seizures than\n       intended by the Supreme Court. The result will be the erosion, and possible destruction, of the\n       exclusionary rule in this state.\n\u00b6 80       Lastly, I disagree with the majority that, at the time the police officers installed the GPS\n       device and used it to monitor the vehicle\u2019s movements, there was any relevant, binding\n       authority which could have authorized their conduct. The case law cited by the majority is\n       either inapposite or was not binding on Illinois state courts. For these reasons, I respectfully\n       dissent.\n\n\u00b6 81                                         BACKGROUND\n\u00b6 82       In 2009, the Aurora police covertly installed a GPS device on a vehicle defendant was\n       known to drive for the purpose of tracking defendant\u2019s movements in the vehicle. The police\n       did not obtain a warrant prior to installing the GPS device. Location data from the GPS device\n       was used to connect defendant to a gas station robbery which took place approximately 24\n       hours after the device was installed. Defendant was subsequently arrested and charged with\n       aggravated robbery, robbery, and burglary. His motion to quash arrest and suppress the\n       evidence gleaned from the GPS tracker was denied, and he was convicted of all charges.\n\u00b6 83       While defendant\u2019s appeal was pending in the appellate court, the United States Supreme\n       Court decided United States v. Jones, 565 U.S. ___, 132 S. Ct. 945 (2012). The Jones Court\n       held that the government\u2019s installation of a GPS device on a suspect\u2019s vehicle, and its use of\n       the device to monitor the vehicle\u2019s movements, constitutes a search under the fourth\n       amendment (U.S. Const., amend. IV). Jones, 565 U.S. at ___, 132 S. Ct. at 949. Taking Jones\n       into consideration, the appellate court below held that a fourth amendment search took place\n       when the police attached the GPS device to the vehicle and used it to track defendant\u2019s\n       movements. 2013 IL App (2d) 100659, \u00b6 13. Accordingly, the appellate court vacated the trial\n       court\u2019s order denying defendant\u2019s motion to quash arrest and suppress evidence. The court\n       then remanded the matter for a new suppression hearing to determine whether defendant had a\n\n\n\n\n                                                  - 20 -\n\f       sufficient possessory interest in the vehicle to raise a constitutional claim under Jones. Id.\n       \u00b6 29. 6\n\u00b6 84       Addressing the State\u2019s appeal of that judgment, the majority now declines to consider\n       whether defendant had a sufficient possessory interest in the vehicle to challenge the search\n       under Jones, or even whether an unconstitutional search took place in the first instance. Supra\n       \u00b6 18. Instead, the majority finds that the good-faith exception in Davis applies because the\n       police installed the GPS device in objectively reasonable reliance on the \u201clegal landscape\u201d in\n       existence at that time, or, alternatively, on binding appellate precedent authorizing the\n       installation. Supra \u00b6 31. The majority thus finds that defendant is not entitled to a new\n       suppression hearing because, even if an unconstitutional search took place, any evidence\n       resulting from the search would be admitted upon retrial.\n\n\u00b6 85                                           ANALYSIS\n\u00b6 86                       I. The Davis Good-Faith Exception Is Incompatible\n                                    With Our State Exclusionary Rule\n\u00b6 87       The United States Supreme Court first recognized a limited \u201cgood-faith\u201d exception to the\n       federal exclusionary rule in United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897 (1984). In Leon, the Supreme\n       Court held that the fourth amendment exclusionary rule does not bar evidence obtained by a\n       police officer who reasonably relies, in objective good faith, on a search warrant issued by a\n       neutral and detached magistrate, but which is later found to be unsupported by probable cause.\n       Id. at 919-22. The Court reasoned that application of the exclusionary rule in this situation\n       would not serve the primary purpose of the rule, which is to deter future police misconduct. Id.\n       at 918-21. This court recognized the Leon good-faith exception for purposes of the state\n       exclusionary rule in People v. Stewart, 104 Ill. 2d 463, 477 (1984); see also People v. Turnage,\n       162 Ill. 2d 299 (1994) (applying Leon).\n\u00b6 88       The Supreme Court extended Leon to a warrantless search for the first time in Illinois v.\n       Krull, 480 U.S. 340 (1987). Krull held that the federal exclusionary rule does not bar evidence\n       seized by a police officer who reasonably relies, in objective good faith, on a statute\n       authorizing a warrantless administrative search, where the statute is later held to be\n       unconstitutional. Id. at 349-50. In People v. Krueger, 175 Ill. 2d 60 (1996), however, this court\n       declined to recognize Krull\u2019s expansion of the Leon good-faith exception as a matter of state\n       constitutional law.\n\u00b6 89       In Krueger, police officers executed a search warrant issued pursuant to a \u201cno-knock\u201d\n       statute (725 ILCS 5/108-8(b) (West 1994)), which this court held was unconstitutional under\n       both the fourth amendment and article I, section 6, of the Illinois Constitution of 1970.\n       Krueger, 175 Ill. 2d at 69-70. The State argued that we should reverse the circuit court\u2019s\n       suppression order pursuant to the Krull good-faith exception. We rejected the State\u2019s\n       argument, holding that the exclusionary rule arising from article I, section 6, provides greater\n       protection from unconstitutional searches and seizures than the federal exclusionary rule. Id. at\n       73-74. We observed that this court has the authority to interpret state constitutional provisions\n\n           6\n            The appellate court also reversed defendant\u2019s convictions and remanded the matter for a new trial\n       based on improper Illinois Supreme Court Rule 401(a) admonishments. The majority affirms this part\n       of the appellate court\u2019s judgment.\n\n                                                    - 21 -\n\f       more broadly than the Supreme Court interprets similar provisions of the federal constitution.\n       Id. at 74 (citing People v. Perry, 147 Ill. 2d 430, 436 (1992)). We also noted that the\n       exclusionary rule is a judicially created remedy with a long history in Illinois, traced back to\n       People v. Brocamp, 307 Ill. 448 (1923). In Brocamp, this court adopted an independent state\n       exclusionary rule almost 40 years before Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643 (1961), made the federal\n       exclusionary rule applicable to the states. Krueger, 175 Ill. 2d at 74-75. See also Illinois v.\n       Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 221-22 (1983); id. at 251 (White, J., concurring) (a state court may rest a\n       decision to modify its state exclusionary rule on adequate and independent state grounds).\n\u00b6 90       In rejecting Krull as a matter of state law, we balanced the legitimate aims of law\n       enforcement against the right of our citizens to be free from unreasonable governmental\n       intrusion. We found that the citizens\u2019 rights prevailed, holding:\n               \u201c[w]e are not willing to recognize an exception to our state exclusionary rule that will\n               provide a grace period for unconstitutional search and seizure legislation, during which\n               time our citizens\u2019 prized constitutional rights can be violated with impunity. We are\n               particularly disturbed by the fact that such a grace period could last for several years\n               and affect large numbers of people. This is simply too high a price for our citizens to\n               pay. We therefore conclude that article I, section 6, of the Illinois Constitution of 1970\n               prohibits the application of Krull\u2019s extended good-faith exception to our state\n               exclusionary rule.\u201d Krueger, 175 Ill. 2d at 75-76.\n\u00b6 91       Our decision in Krueger relied on the reasoning set forth in Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s dissent in\n       Krull. See id. at 72-73. Justice O\u2019Connor criticized the Krull majority\u2019s extension of the Leon\n       good-faith exception, arguing that this newly created exception was not supported by the\n       rationale in Leon. Id. at 72 (citing Krull, 480 U.S. at 361 (O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting, joined by\n       Brennan, Marshall and Stevens, JJ.)). First, she observed that, in contrast to a search authorized\n       by a facially valid warrant later found to be defective, there was a \u201c \u2018powerful historical basis\n       for the exclusion of evidence gathered pursuant to a search authorized by an unconstitutional\n       statute.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting Krull, 480 U.S. at 362 (O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting, joined by Brennan,\n       Marshall and Stevens, JJ.)). Second, Justice O\u2019Connor argued that legislators were much more\n       likely to pose a threat to fourth amendment protections than a neutral magistrate issuing a\n       search warrant in a specific case. She noted:\n               \u201c \u2018Judicial authorization of a particular search does not threaten the liberty of everyone,\n               but rather authorizes a single search under particular circumstances. The legislative act,\n               on the other hand, sweeps broadly, authorizing whole classes of searches, without any\n               particularized showing. A judicial officer\u2019s unreasonable authorization of a search\n               affects one person at a time; a legislature\u2019s unreasonable authorization of searches may\n               affect thousands or millions and will almost always affect more than one. Certainly the\n               latter poses a greater threat to liberty.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 72-73 (quoting Krull, 480 U.S. at 365\n               (O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting, joined by Brennan, Marshall and Stevens, JJ.)).\n\u00b6 92       Moreover, Justice O\u2019Connor observed that the majority\u2019s decision was at odds with the\n       retroactivity principles in Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U.S. 314 (1987), which held that \u201c \u2018basic\n       norms of constitutional adjudication\u2019 and fairness to similarly situated defendants\u201d required\n       that opinions announcing new constitutional rules in criminal cases apply to all cases pending\n       on direct review at the time the new rule is declared. Krull, 480 U.S. at 368 (O\u2019Connor, J.,\n       dissenting, joined by Brennan, Marshall and Stevens, JJ.) (quoting Griffith, 479 U.S. at 322).\n\n\n                                                   - 22 -\n\f       Justice O\u2019Connor pointed out that, under the novel approach taken by the Krull majority, \u201c \u2018no\n       effective remedy is to be provided in the very case in which the statute at issue was held\n       unconstitutional.\u2019 \u201d Krueger, 175 Ill. 2d at 73 (citing Krull, 480 U.S. at 368 (O\u2019Connor, J.,\n       dissenting, joined by Brennan, Marshall and Stevens, JJ.)). As Justice O\u2019Connor noted, \u201cthe\n       lack of a remedy leaves no incentive for the aggrieved defendant to challenge the statute as\n       unconstitutional.\u201d Id. (citing Krull, 480 U.S. at 369 (O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting, joined by\n       Brennan, Marshall and Stevens, JJ.)).\n\u00b6 93       The same flaws identified by this court in Krueger with respect to the Krull good-faith\n       exception are inherent in the good-faith exception for police searches \u201cconducted in\n       objectively reasonable reliance on binding appellate precedent\u201d (Davis, 564 U.S. at ___, 131 S.\n       Ct. at 2423-24), applied by the majority in the case at bar. Under both good-faith exceptions,\n       the police are said to have reasonably relied on existing authority (an authorizing statute in\n       Krull; binding appellate authority in Davis), which is later found to be unconstitutional or\n       overruled by subsequent case law. In both situations, there is a \u201cgrace period,\u201d which could last\n       several years, during which the state is free to perform unconstitutional searches and seizures\n       with impunity. See Krueger, 175 Ill. 2d at 75; Krull, 480 U.S. at 361 (O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting,\n       joined by Brennan, Marshall and Stevens, JJ.). Just as in Krull, the Davis good-faith exception\n       has the potential to affect thousands of people by authorizing a whole class of searches, in\n       contrast to a single search authorized by a defective search warrant. See Krueger, 175 Ill. 2d at\n       72-73; Krull, 480 U.S. at 365 (O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting, joined by Brennan, Marshall and\n       Stevens, JJ.). Moreover, under both Krull and Davis, the lack of a remedy leaves no incentive\n       for a defendant to challenge a statute as unconstitutional or to seek to overturn case law\n       authorizing an unconstitutional search. See Krueger, 175 Ill. 2d at 73; Krull, 480 U.S. at 368\n       (O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting, joined by Brennan, Marshall and Stevens, JJ.); see also Davis, 564\n       U.S. at ___, 131 S. Ct. at 2438 (Breyer, J., dissenting, joined by Ginsburg, J.) (criticizing the\n       Davis majority for adopting a good-faith exception at odds with retroactivity principles and\n       arguing that a defendant has little incentive to challenge court precedent). Finally, unlike Leon,\n       which \u201csimply instructs courts that police officers may rely upon a facially valid search\n       warrant,\u201d the good-faith exceptions in Krull and Davis are difficult for courts to administer\n       because it is \u201cnot apparent how much constitutional law the reasonable officer is expected to\n       know.\u201d Krull, 480 U.S. at 366-67 (O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting, joined by Brennan, Marshall and\n       Stevens, JJ.); see also Davis, 564 U.S. at ___, 131 S. Ct. at 2437 (Breyer, J., dissenting, joined\n       by Ginsburg, J.) (application of the Davis good-faith exception will result in \u201ccomplex legal\n       argument and police force confusion\u201d).\n\u00b6 94       This court noted in Krueger that Krull had been severely criticized by fourth amendment\n       scholars. See Krueger, 175 Ill. 2d at 76 (citing 1 Wayne R. LaFave, Search and Seizure\n       \u00a7 1.3(h), at 96-99 (3d ed. 1996)). Davis also has received sharp criticism from legal scholars\n       for its potential to erode, or even nullify, the federal exclusionary rule. See 1 Wayne R.\n       LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a7 1.3(h), at 132-46 (5th ed. 2012); George M. Dery III, \u201cThis\n       Bitter Pill\u201d: The Supreme Court\u2019s Distaste for the Exclusionary Rule in Davis v. United States\n       Makes Evidence Suppression Impossible to Swallow, 23 Geo.

Several state courts already have rejected Davis on state law grounds. See, e.g.,\n\n                                                   - 23 -\n\f       Brown v. State, 767 S.E.2d 299, 302-03 (Ga.

Koivu, 272 P.3d 483, 518-19 (Idaho 2012).\n\u00b6 95       The majority\u2019s recognition of the Davis good-faith exception in this case is totally at odds\n       with Krueger, where this court held that our state exclusionary rule provides greater protection\n       of our citizens\u2019 constitutional rights than the federal exclusionary rule. I cannot see a way to\n       reconcile today\u2019s decision with Krueger. I would find that Krueger precludes this court from\n       adopting the Davis good-faith exception for purposes of our state exclusionary rule, and thus,\n       that defendant is entitled to a new suppression hearing.\n\n\u00b6 96                 II. The Majority\u2019s \u201cGood-Faith Inquiry\u201d and \u201cLegal Landscape\u201d\n                        Theories Are Not Supported by the Narrow Holding in Davis\n\u00b6 97       Even if I agreed that the Davis good-faith exception should be extended to the exclusionary\n       rule arising out of article I, section 6, of the Illinois Constitution, I could not sign on to the\n       majority\u2019s alternative holding in this case. The majority finds that the good-faith exception in\n       Davis is not limited to \u201cobjectively reasonable reliance on binding appellate precedent.\u201d See\n       Davis, 564 U.S. at ___, 131 S. Ct. at 2423-24. According to the majority, in the absence of any\n       binding precedent authorizing the actions of the police:\n               \u201c[i]t would still be necessary to conduct the \u2018good-faith inquiry\u2019 and consider \u2018whether\n               a reasonably well trained officer would have known that the search was illegal in light\n               of all of the circumstances.\u2019 [Citation.] Clearly, application of the good-faith inquiry is\n               not limited to the specific circumstances addressed by the Supreme Court in Davis or in\n               any other Supreme Court case. [Citation.] The Supreme Court has found the\n               exclusionary rule to be inapplicable in a variety of settings after undertaking the\n               good-faith analysis, and the fact that a court might apply the good-faith exception in a\n               new context not yet addressed by the Supreme Court does not mean that it is creating a\n               \u2018new, freestanding exception\u2019 to the exclusionary rule. [Citations.]\n                                                     ***\n                    *** [W]e find in the alternative that, pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s general\n               good-faith analysis, the police conduct in relying on the legal landscape that existed at\n               the time was objectively reasonable and a reasonable officer had no reason to suspect\n               that his conduct was wrongful under the circumstances.\u201d Supra \u00b6 29.\n\u00b6 98       I disagree with both aspects of the majority\u2019s alternative holding: (1) that the Supreme\n       Court\u2019s good-faith decisions contemplate a general \u201cgood-faith inquiry\u201d not limited to the\n       specific circumstances in those decisions; and (2) that, in the absence of binding appellate\n       precedent, the good-faith exception applies to a search conducted in objectively reasonable\n       reliance on the existing \u201clegal landscape.\u201d\n\u00b6 99       First, the authority the majority cites for the proposition that the \u201cgood-faith inquiry\u201d is not\n       limited to the specific circumstances in Davis, or in any other Supreme Court case, is a\n       decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit (United States v.\n       Stephens, 764 F.3d 327, 338 (4th Cir. 2014)), which, obviously, is not binding on this court.\n       See In re May 1991 Will County Grand Jury, 152 Ill. 2d 381, 398 (1992). I do not find the\n       reasoning in that case to be persuasive. The Supreme Court has, thus far, taken great care to\n       limit application of the good-faith exception to specific, atypical searches involving reasonable\n       reliance by the police. See United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897 (1984) (later-invalidated\n\n                                                    - 24 -\n\f        warrant); Illinois v. Krull, 480 U.S. 340 (1987) (subsequently overturned statute); Arizona v.\n        Evans, 514 U.S. 1 (1995) (error in court-maintained database); Herring v. United States, 555\n        U.S. 135 (2009) (error in police-maintained database); Davis v. United States, 564 U.S. ___,\n        131 S. Ct. 2419 (2011) (later-reversed binding appellate precedent). In my view, these\n        decisions should be read narrowly and their holdings limited to the particular factual scenarios\n        before the Court. Warrantless searches generally are considered per se unreasonable unless\n        they fall within \u201c \u2018a few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions.\u2019 \u201d People v.\n        Galvin, 127 Ill. 2d 153, 169-70 (1989) (quoting Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 357\n        (1967)). The majority\u2019s adoption of a \u201cgeneral good-faith analysis\u201d (supra \u00b6 31) under which\n        evidence resulting from an unconstitutional search will be admitted in the absence of gross\n        negligence by the police, regrettably turns the exception into the rule. See United States v.\n        Katzin, 769 F.3d 163, 189-90 (3d Cir. 2014) (en banc) (Greenaway, J., dissenting, joined by\n        McKee, C.J., and Ambro, Fuentes, and Smith, JJ.).\n\u00b6 100        Under the majority\u2019s reasoning, police officers are authorized to conduct warrantless\n        searches based solely on their own good judgment about the existence of probable cause, and,\n        if they are wrong, the evidence will almost never be suppressed. The alarming scope of the\n        majority\u2019s alternative holding is exactly why this court rejected the Krull good-faith exception\n        in Krueger. We feared that the good-faith exception would weaken our state exclusionary rule\n        by leaving citizens without a remedy for constitutionally invalid searches and seizures. The\n        dissenters in Davis echoed this concern with respect to the federal exclusionary rule.\n                \u201c[A]n officer who conducts a search that he believes complies with the Constitution but\n                which, it ultimately turns out, falls just outside the Fourth Amendment\u2019s bounds is no\n                more culpable than an officer who follows erroneous \u2018binding precedent.\u2019 Nor is an\n                officer more culpable where circuit precedent is simply suggestive rather than\n                \u2018binding,\u2019 where it only describes how to treat roughly analogous instances, or where it\n                just does not exist. Thus, if the Court means what it now says, if it would place\n                determinative weight upon the culpability of an individual officer\u2019s conduct, and if it\n                would apply the exclusionary rule only where a Fourth Amendment violation was\n                \u2018deliberate, reckless, or grossly negligent,\u2019 then the \u2018good faith exception\u2019 will swallow\n                the exclusionary rule. ***\n                    Any such change (which may already be underway) would affect not \u2018an\n                exceedingly small set of cases,\u2019 [citation] but a very large number of cases, potentially\n                many thousands each year. [Citation.] And since the exclusionary rule is often the only\n                sanction available for a Fourth Amendment violation, the Fourth Amendment would\n                no longer protect ordinary Americans from \u2018unreasonable searches and seizures.\u2019\n                [Citations.] It would become a watered-down Fourth Amendment, offering its\n                protection against only those searches and seizures that are egregiously unreasonable.\u201d\n                (Emphasis in original.) Davis, 564 U.S. at ___, 131 S. Ct. at 2438-40 (Breyer, J.,\n                dissenting, joined by Ginsburg, J.).\n\u00b6 101        The majority\u2019s expansion of the Davis good-faith exception also runs afoul of this court\u2019s\n        holding in People v. Madison, 121 Ill. 2d 195 (1988), abrogated on other grounds by Horton v.\n        California, 496 U.S. 128 (1990). In Madison, 121 Ill. 2d at 207-08, police officers conducted a\n        warrantless inspection of a salvage yard pursuant to an authorizing provision in the Illinois\n        Vehicle Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1983, ch. 95\u00bd, \u00b6 5-403). The officers then seized 26 incomplete\n\n\n                                                    - 25 -\n\f        certificates of vehicle title without first obtaining a search warrant, despite statutory language\n        stating that a warrant was required. The owner of the salvage yard was charged with possession\n        of the incomplete titles. At trial, the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence was granted,\n        and the case was dismissed. The appellate court affirmed. This court affirmed the lower courts.\n        Madison, 121 Ill. 2d at 211. We first held that the plain language of section 5-403 of the\n        Vehicle Code required police officers to obtain a warrant before seizing evidence in the course\n        of a valid administrative search. Id. at 200-06. Because the officers seized the titles without a\n        warrant, the evidence was illegally obtained and subject to suppression. The State next argued\n        that the evidence, even if illegally obtained, was not subject to the exclusionary rule because\n        the officers relied, in good faith, on their own interpretation of the statute. We rejected the\n        State\u2019s invitation to extend the good-faith exceptions in Leon and Krull to these circumstances.\n        We said that the officers were acting in defiance of, not reliance on, the language in the\n        authorizing statute. Id. at 208. Moreover, we held:\n                \u201cto adopt the extension of the good-faith exception proposed by the State would\n                essentially eviscerate the exclusionary rule as it is currently enforced. Police officers\n                would be encouraged to defy the plain language of statutes as written in favor of their\n                own interpretations in conducting searches and seizures. Such a proposal, giving the\n                police unlimited authority to conduct searches and seizures until specifically restricted\n                by the legislature or the courts, is fundamentally at odds with the central purpose of\n                deterring police misconduct which underlies the exclusionary rule.\u201d Id.\n\u00b6 102       Thus, this court in Madison expressly refused to recognize an extension of the good-faith\n        exception, reasoning that such an extension would eviscerate our state exclusionary rule by\n        encouraging police officers to rely on their own interpretations of statutes rather than seek to\n        obtain a warrant. In contravention of what we said in Madison, the majority now recognizes a\n        general exception to the exclusionary rule, whereby an officer\u2019s interpretation of a statute or\n        case law, if made in \u201cgood faith,\u201d would prevent the exclusion of evidence. Today\u2019s decision is\n        a radical departure from our settled case law in both Krueger and Madison, which the majority\n        does not reconcile.\n\u00b6 103       Under the second part of the majority\u2019s alternative holding, the majority rules that, in the\n        absence of binding appellate precedent authorizing a search, Davis allows a good-faith\n        exception for searches conducted in reasonable reliance on the \u201clegal landscape\u201d that existed at\n        the time the search was conducted. Supra \u00b6\u00b6 31, 51. The majority identifies only two cases\n        decided prior to April 23, 2009, which might have justified the officers\u2019 actions at the time of\n        the search. See supra \u00b6 52 (citing United States v. Garcia, 474 F.3d 994, 996-98 (7th Cir.\n        2007), and United States v. McIver, 186 F.3d 1119, 1126-27 (9th Cir. 1999)). These two\n        nonbinding decisions were, in the majority\u2019s view, sufficient to comprise the prevailing \u201clegal\n        landscape\u201d upon which the police could have reasonably relied in conducting their warrantless\n        search. 7\n\n            7\n             The majority states that the Supreme Court\u2019s \u201cbeeper\u201d cases, United States v. Knotts, 460 U.S. 276\n        (1983), and United States v. Karo, 468 U.S. 705 (1984), were \u201cwidely and reasonably understood to\n        stand for the proposition that the fourth amendment was simply not implicated by electronic\n        surveillance of automotive movements.\u201d Supra \u00b6 52. However, most of the federal court opinions\n        referenced by the majority were decided after the search in this case took place, and, thus, could not\n        have been relied upon by the Aurora police.\n\n                                                      - 26 -\n\f\u00b6 104        The majority\u2019s \u201clegal landscape\u201d theory is directly at odds with Davis, which contains\n        multiple, repeated references to the officers\u2019 reasonable reliance on \u201cbinding\u201d precedent.\n        Davis recognized a narrow exception, whereby \u201csearches conducted in objectively reasonable\n        reliance on binding appellate precedent are not subject to the exclusionary rule.\u201d Davis, 564\n        U.S. at ___, 131 S. Ct. at 2423-24. The Court found that the officers\u2019 search of the defendant\n        incident to his arrest \u201cfollowed the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s Gonzalez precedent to the letter.\u201d Id. at\n        ___, 131 S. Ct. at 2428. The Court emphasized that the officers strictly complied with\n        \u201cthen-binding Circuit law\u201d and \u201cscrupulously adhered to governing law\u201d in the Eleventh\n        Circuit. Id. at ___, ___, 131 S. Ct. at 2428, 2434. Furthermore, in the course of explaining that\n        its acceptance of a good-faith exception would not deter defendants from challenging existing\n        fourth amendment doctrine in future cases, the Court noted that \u201cdefendants in jurisdictions in\n        which the question remains open will still have an undiminished incentive to litigate the issue.\u201d\n        (Emphasis added.) Id. at ___, 131 S. Ct. at 2433. See also Davis, 564 U.S. at ___, 131 S. Ct. at\n        2435 (Sotomayor, J., concurring in the judgment) (noting that \u201c[t]his case does not present the\n        markedly different question whether the exclusionary rule applies when the law governing the\n        constitutionality of a particular search is unsettled\u201d). Davis thus recognized that its holding\n        was limited to jurisdictions which clearly authorized the officers\u2019 conduct.\n\u00b6 105        The majority\u2019s alternative holding is an alarming and unwarranted expansion of the\n        carefully circumscribed good-faith exception in Davis. There are no references in Davis to\n        \u201cgenerally accepted authority,\u201d \u201clegal landscape,\u201d or persuasive or well-reasoned precedent.\n        See United States v. Ortiz, 878 F. Supp. 2d 515, 539-40 (E.D. Pa. 2012). See also United States\n        v. Martin, 712 F.3d 1080, 1081-82 (7th Cir. 2013) (per curiam) (where there was no binding\n        appellate precedent in the Eighth Circuit at the time that Iowa law enforcement officers\n        attached a GPS device to the defendant\u2019s car, the court declined to expand Davis to allow\n        police to rely on \u201ca diffuse notion of the weight of authority around the country\u201d).\n        Accordingly, the majority\u2019s holding that the Davis good-faith exception applies based on the\n        officers\u2019 objectively reasonable reliance on the \u201clegal landscape\u201d is a deliberate misreading of\n        Davis.\n\u00b6 106        The majority\u2019s alternative holding is troubling for the additional reason that it signifies this\n        court\u2019s abandonment of its duty to decide constitutional issues and shifts such decisionmaking\n        to the police. Based on its application of the Davis good-faith exception, the majority declines\n        to consider the important constitutional issues raised in this appeal. At the time of the search in\n        this case, there was no binding precedent in Illinois with respect to warrantless, surreptitious\n        GPS installation and monitoring. And because the majority refuses to address the\n        constitutionality of GPS surveillance, there still is none. I fear that the majority\u2019s expansion of\n        the good-faith doctrine will inevitably lead to the avoidance of meaningful analysis of the\n        constitutionality of searches and seizures, particularly those involving new technology.\n\n\u00b6 107                       III. Knotts, Karo, and Garcia Were Not \u201cBinding\u201d\n                                           Authority Under Davis\n\u00b6 108      My final point of disagreement is with the majority\u2019s application of the Davis good-faith\n        exception to the police officers\u2019 objectively reasonable reliance on United States v. Knotts, 460\n        U.S. 276 (1983), United States v. Karo, 468 U.S. 705 (1984), and United States v. Garcia, 474\n\n\n\n                                                     - 27 -\n\f        F.3d 994 (7th Cir. 2007). None of these cases constitutes \u201cbinding\u201d precedent within the\n        meaning of Davis.\n\u00b6 109       Knotts held that the use of a covert beeper device to monitor a vehicle\u2019s movements during\n        a single journey did not amount to a search because \u201c[a] person traveling in an automobile on\n        public thoroughfares has no reasonable expectation of privacy in his movements from one\n        place to another.\u201d Knotts, 460 U.S. at 281-82, 285. The beeper was placed in a chloroform\n        container with the consent of the container\u2019s owner before being transferred to the defendant.\n        Id. at 278. The Court expressly left open the question of whether the warrantless installation of\n        the device converted the subsequent tracking into a search. Id. at 279 n.*. See also id. at 286\n        (Brennan, J., concurring in the judgment, joined by Marshall, J.) (\u201cI think this would have been\n        a much more difficult case if respondent had challenged, not merely certain aspects of the\n        monitoring of the beeper ***, but also its original installation.\u201d). Thus, Knotts did not\n        \u201cspecifically authorize[ ]\u201d the \u201cparticular police practice\u201d (emphasis omitted) (Davis, 564 U.S.\n        at ___, 131 S. Ct. at 2429) in this case\u2014the installation of the GPS device on the Kia, and\n        officers could not have reasonably relied on Knotts in their decision to install the device\n        without a warrant.\n\u00b6 110       Karo addressed the government\u2019s placement of a beeper device in a container of ether,\n        which was sold to the respondents by a government informant and used to monitor them\n        without respondents\u2019 knowledge. The Court held that the respondents had no legitimate\n        expectation of privacy in the container because, at the time of the beeper\u2019s placement, the\n        respondents did not own the container. Karo, 468 U.S. at 711. Because the container\u2019s owner\n        consented to the beeper placement, the actual installation of the beeper violated no one\u2019s fourth\n        amendment rights. Id. The Court went on to hold that the transfer of the beeper-laden can to the\n        respondents did not constitute a search because it conveyed no information that respondents\n        wished to keep private and, thus, infringed no privacy interests. Id. at 712. Nor did the transfer\n        constitute a seizure, because there was no \u201cmeaningful interference with an individual\u2019s\n        possessory interests\u201d in the property. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. As in Knotts, the\n        Karo Court \u201cdid not consider a scenario in which the government installs a tracking device on\n        property that already belongs to the defendant.\u201d United States v. Sparks, 711 F.3d 58, 65 n.4\n        (1st Cir. 2013).\n\u00b6 111       Neither Knotts nor Karo stands for the proposition that the warrantless installation of a\n        tracking device onto a privately owned vehicle without the owner\u2019s consent is lawful under the\n        fourth amendment. Therefore, the police in this case could not have reasonably relied on either\n        of these cases to conclude that the nonconsensual installation of the GPS device was\n        constitutionally authorized. Significantly, United States v. Jones, 565 U.S. ___, 132 S. Ct. 945\n        (2012), in which the Court found that installation of a GPS device was a search, did not\n        overrule either Knotts or Karo but distinguished them on the basis that neither case involved\n        the nonconsensual installation of a tracking device onto private property. In other words, the\n        Supreme Court expressly rejected the reading of those cases which the majority adopts here.\n        See id. at ___, 132 S. Ct. at 951-52 (holding that a trespassory installation of a tracking device\n        was not at issue in Knotts because the beeper was placed in the container with the consent of\n        the then-owner, and Knotts did not challenge that installation); id. at ___, 132 S. Ct. at 952\n        (holding that the installation of the beeper in Karo was with the consent of the original owner;\n        moreover, because \u201cKaro accepted the container as it came to him, beeper and all, [he] was\n        therefore not entitled to object to the beeper\u2019s presence. [Citation.] Jones, who possessed the\n\n                                                    - 28 -\n\f        Jeep at the time the Government trespassorily inserted the information-gathering device, is on\n        much different footing.\u201d)\n\u00b6 112       The fact that the Jones Court distinguished Knotts and Karo, but did not overrule them,\n        takes this case out of the Davis good-faith exception. In Davis, the police officers\u2019 search\n        followed binding circuit precedent \u201cto the letter,\u201d and, although that precedent was later\n        overturned, the officers\u2019 conduct at the time of the search \u201cwas in strict compliance with\n        then-binding Circuit law and was not culpable in any way.\u201d Davis, 564 U.S. at ___, 131 S. Ct.\n        at 2428. The complete absence of police culpability or deliberate misconduct \u201cdoom[ed]\n        Davis\u2019s claim\u201d because exclusion of the evidence would not yield any meaningful deterrence.\n        Id. at ___, 131 S. Ct. at 2428-29. Under the Court\u2019s reasoning, where binding appellate\n        authority \u201cspecifically authorizes a particular police practice\u201d (emphasis in original) (id. at\n        ___, 131 S. Ct. at 2429), exclusion of the evidence does not serve the purpose of deterring\n        unconstitutional police conduct because the sole responsibility for the fourth amendment\n        violation lies with the appellate judiciary and not with the police. When the police conduct a\n        search in reliance on precedent that does not specifically authorize the particular practice,\n        however, the exclusionary rule does provide meaningful deterrence. It deters law enforcement\n        officers from taking the fourth amendment inquiry into their own hands by extrapolating from,\n        or analogizing to, existing case law, instead of seeking a warrant from a neutral magistrate. See\n        United States v. Katzin, 769 F.3d 163, 191-92 (3d Cir. 2014) (en banc) (Greenaway, J.,\n        dissenting, joined by McKee, C.J., and Ambro, Fuentes, and Smith, JJ.). The exclusionary rule\n        also encourages law enforcement officials to \u201cerr on the side of constitutional behavior\u201d in the\n        face of unsettled or equivocal fourth amendment law. See Davis, 564 U.S. at ___, 131 S. Ct. at\n        2435 (Sotomayor, J., concurring in the judgment); State v. Mitchell, 323 P.3d 69, \u00b6 31 (Ariz.\n        Ct. App. 2014). \u201c[T]he Davis requirement of \u2018binding appellate precedent\u2019 means that\n        government agents should not be and need not be vested with discretion in predicting or\n        anticipating how the law will develop and how it should be applied. *** The solution is simple:\n        the import of Davis is that officers acting without clearly applicable binding appellate guidance\n        should err on the side of caution and obtain a warrant.\u201d United States v. Ortiz, 878 F. Supp. 2d\n        515, 542 (E.D. Pa. 2012).\n\u00b6 113       In contrast to Davis, where binding precedent explicitly authorized the officers\u2019 actions\n        and the officers were not culpable in any way because they followed the Eleventh Circuit\n        precedent \u201cto the letter\u201d (Davis, 564 U.S. at ___, ___, 131 S. Ct. at 2428, 2429), here there was\n        no binding precedent which specifically authorized the police officers\u2019 conduct. See, e.g., id. at\n        ___, 131 S. Ct. at 2437 (Breyer, J. dissenting, joined by Ginsburg, J.) (Davis did not address\n        officers\u2019 reliance on a decision with \u201cclearly distinguishable\u201d or \u201chighly analogous\u201d facts);\n        United States v. Sparks, 711 F.3d 58, 64 (1st Cir. 2013) (Davis good-faith exception applies\n        only to precedent that is \u201cclear and well-settled\u201d). Thus, there is no basis for holding that the\n        police reasonably relied on Knotts or Karo as authorization for their installation of the GPS\n        device without first obtaining a warrant or permission from the vehicle\u2019s owner.\n\u00b6 114       The majority also holds that Davis applies because the Aurora police acted in objectively\n        reasonable reliance on the Seventh Circuit\u2019s decision in United States v. Garcia, 474 F.3d 994\n        (7th Cir. 2007). Garcia held that the warrantless installation of a GPS tracking device on a\n        vehicle in order to obtain information about a suspect\u2019s movements in the vehicle was not a\n        fourth amendment \u201csearch.\u201d Id. at 996-98. Unlike the Eleventh Circuit precedent relied on by\n        the police in Davis, however, Garcia was not \u201cbinding appellate precedent\u201d on Illinois state\n\n                                                    - 29 -\n\f        courts, the jurisdiction in which the Aurora police were operating and in which defendant was\n        prosecuted.\n\u00b6 115        The applicable body of case law upon which a law enforcement officer may reasonably\n        rely consists of those decisions that are binding on the jurisdiction in which the officer\n        operates. See Hudson v. Michigan, 547 U.S. 586, 599 (2006) (noting that officers are expected\n        to learn and abide by \u201cwhat is required of them\u201d by courts having jurisdiction over them). The\n        Davis good-faith exception thus is not available unless there exists binding precedent within\n        the particular jurisdiction governing the law enforcement officials. See United States v.\n        Aguiar, 737 F.3d 251, 261 (2d Cir. 2013) (holding that \u201cbinding appellate precedent\u201d within\n        the meaning of Davis refers only to precedent of the Second Circuit and the United States\n        Supreme Court); United States v. Barraza-Maldonado, 732 F.3d 865, 867 (8th Cir. 2013)\n        (\u201c[f]or the good faith exception to apply, officers performing a particular investigatory\n        action\u2014such as GPS tracking\u2014must strictly comply with binding appellate precedent\n        governing the jurisdiction in which they are acting\u201d).\n\u00b6 116        Where state courts are silent on the constitutionality of a particular police practice, law\n        enforcement officers who engage in that practice without first obtaining a search warrant from\n        a neutral magistrate must knowingly accept the risk that their conduct will be found\n        unconstitutional. First, they risk that a state court may decide to depart from federal case law in\n        interpreting a federal constitutional provision. Caleb Mason, New Police Surveillance\n        Technologies and the Good-Faith Exception: Warrantless GPS Tracker Evidence After United\n        States v. Jones, 13 Nev. L.J. 60, 76 (2012). Decisions of a United States court of appeals, while\n        persuasive, are not binding on state courts. In re May 1991 Will County Grand Jury, 152 Ill. 2d\n        381, 398 (1992) (citing People v. Fields, 135 Ill. 2d 18, 72 (1990)); see also People v. Eyler,\n        133 Ill. 2d 173, 225 (1989) (\u201c[u]ntil the Supreme Court of the United States has spoken, State\n        courts are not precluded from exercising their own judgments on Federal constitutional\n        questions\u201d). Second, the police risk that a state court may interpret a constitutional provision in\n        its own state constitution more strictly than a corresponding provision in the federal\n        constitution. See In re May 1991 Will County Grand Jury, 152 Ill. 2d 381, 390 (1992). In fact,\n        this court has held that the Illinois Constitution of 1970 \u201coffers greater protection against the\n        invasion of an individual\u2019s privacy rights than does the Federal Constitution.\u201d Id. Thus, in a\n        posture of state silence and federal approval of a particular search, the exclusionary rule serves\n        its intended purpose: to \u201cdeter future Fourth Amendment violations.\u201d Davis, 564 U.S. at ___,\n        131 S. Ct. at 2426; see also id. at ___, 131 S. Ct. at 2435 (Sotomayor, J., concurring in the\n        judgment) (\u201cwhen police decide to conduct a search or seizure in the absence of case law (or\n        other authority) specifically sanctioning such action, exclusion of the evidence obtained may\n        deter Fourth Amendment violations\u201d (emphasis added)); Caleb Mason, New Police\n        Surveillance Technologies and the Good-Faith Exception: Warrantless GPS Tracker Evidence\n        After United States v. Jones, 13 Nev. L.J. 60, 76 (2012).\n\u00b6 117        Of course, the police can avoid the harsh consequence of the evidence being excluded by\n        obtaining a warrant in the first place, rather than gambling that the search will not eventually be\n        held unconstitutional by a court in that jurisdiction. 8 In this case, the officers were state police\n\n            8\n             A warrant is now statutorily required in Illinois before the police may use a GPS to track a person\u2019s\n        movements. Effective August 26, 2014, the Freedom From Location Surveillance Act requires a law\n        enforcement agency to obtain a court order supported by probable cause before using an electronic\n\n                                                       - 30 -\n\f        officers investigating a state crime and had no reason to believe that the case would be\n        prosecuted in federal court. 9 Accordingly, the officers could not have presumed, in reliance on\n        Garcia, that the warrantless installation of the GPS device was constitutional.\n\u00b6 118       For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\u00b6 119       JUSTICES FREEMAN and THEIS join in this dissent.\n\n\n\n\n        device to obtain \u201ccurrent or future location information pertaining to a person or his or her effects.\u201d\n        Pub.
