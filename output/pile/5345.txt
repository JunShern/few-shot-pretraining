But who doesn\u2019t? And why wouldn\u2019t you? That\u2019s what holidays are for\u2013a break from the everyday, a little more spice in your life\u2026a little extra cheese on your dessert table! But now..it\u2019s payback time. I\u2019m not going to complain about it, or write-up a big plan with resolutions and promises. I\u2019m simply just going to tell you what I\u2019m having to eat this week. Soup. All kinds of soup. And lots of it. It\u2019s filling, it\u2019s hearty, it warms the soul on a bleak January day. And it\u2019s low cal. So, here\u2019s the recipe for my husband\u2019s favourite. Some protein for him, some starch for me, tons of veggies and oodles of flavour. And if you\u2019re still REALLY jonesing for that cheese plate, add a dash of fresh parm. I promise I won\u2019t judge. Enjoy.\n\nGreens & beans winter soup\n\nWhat\u2019s in it\n\n1 yellow onion, chopped\n\n3 cloves garlic, minced\n\n1 head of organic chard, chopped\n\n1 head of organic collards, chopped\n\n1 head of organic kale, de-spined and chopped\n\n4 carrots, chopped\n\n4 stalk celery, chopped\n\n3 sweet potatoes, chopped\n\n1 large yellow-fleshed potato, chopped\n\n4 cups of organic navy beans\n\nVeggie stock \u2013 lots of it\n\nOlive oil\n\nSalt, pepper and hot sauce to taste\n\nHow to make it\n\nHeat up a good glug of olive oil in a deep stock pot and add onions and garlic. Saute until fragrant. Add potatoes and carrots. Mix and saute for another 2-3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add celery and beans and mix for an additional 3-4 minutes. Season accordingly. Once heated through, add enough stock to completely cover veggies and bring to boil. Simmer for 20 minutes, or until vegetables are soft. Add chopped greens and more stock if necessary. Simmer for an additional 5-10 minutes and the soup is ready to serve! Top with hot sauce and fresh parm if you aren\u2019t going dairy free for a while!"
