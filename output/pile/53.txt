It is in the shadow of Boswell, the best of all biographers,\nand not in that of Johnson, that we feel ourselves at present\ncowering. Yet we must try to give a rapid account of the leading\nincidents in Johnson's life, as well as a short estimate of his vast,\nrugged genius.\n\nSamuel Johnson was born at Lichfield, Staffordshire, on the 18th of\nSeptember 1709, and was baptized the same day. His father was Michael\nJohnson, a bookseller and stationer, and his mother, Sarah Ford.\nSamuel was the first-born of the family. Nathaniel, who died in his\ntwenty-fifth year, was the second and the last. Johnson very early\nbegan to manifest both his peculiar prejudices and his peculiar\npowers. When a mere child, we see him in Lichfield Cathedral, perched\non his father's shoulders, gazing at Sacheverel, the famous Tory\npreacher. We hear him, about the same time, roaring to his mother, who\nhad given him, a minute before, a collect in the Common Prayer-Book to\nget by heart as his day's task,--\"Mother, I can say it already!\" His\nfirst teacher, Dame Oliver, a widow, thought him, as she well might,\nthe best scholar she ever had. From her he passed into the hands of\none Tom Brown, an original, who once published a spelling-book, and\ndedicated it \"to the Universe!\"--without permission, we presume. He\nbegan to learn Latin first with a Mr Hawkins, and then with a Mr\nHunter, head-master of Lichfield,--a petty tyrant, although a good\nscholar, under whom, to use Gay's language, Johnson was\n\n\"Lash'd into Latin by the tingling rod.\"\n\nAt the age of fifteen, he was transferred to Stourbridge school, and\nto the care of a Mr Wentworth, who \"taught him a great deal.\" There\nhe remained twelve months, at the close of which he returned home, and\nfor two years lived in his father's house, in comparative idleness,\nloitering in the fields, and reading much, but desultorily. In 1728,\nbeing flattered with some promises of aid from a Shropshire gentleman,\nnamed Corbet, which were never fulfilled, he went to Oxford, and was\nentered as a commoner in Pembroke College. His father accompanied and\nintroduced him to Dr Adams, and to Jorden, who became his tutor,\nrecommending his son as a good scholar and a poet. Under Jorden's\ncare, however, he did little except translate Pope's \"Messiah\" into\nLatin verse,--a task which he performed with great rapidity, and so\nwell, that Pope warmly commended it when he saw it printed in a\nmiscellany of poems. About this time, the hypochondriac affection,\nwhich rendered Johnson's long life a long disease, began to manifest\nitself. In the vacation of 1729, he was seized with the darkest\ndespondency, which he tried to alleviate by violent exercise and other\nmeans, but in vain. It seems to have left him during a fit of\nindignation at Dr Swinfen (a physician at Lichfield, who, struck by\nthe elegant Latinity of an account of his malady, which the sufferer\nhad put into his hands, showed it in all directions), but continued to\nrecur at frequent intervals till the close of his life. His malady was\nundoubtedly of a maniacal cast, resembling Cowper's, but subdued by\nsuperior strength of will--a Bucephalus, which it required all the\npower of a Johnson to back and bridle. In his early days, he had been\npiously inclined, but after his ninth year, fell into a state of\nindifference to religion. This continued till he met, at Oxford, Law's\n\"Serious Call,\" which, he says, \"overmatched\" and compelled him to\nconsider the subject with earnestness. And whatever, in after years,\nwere the errors of his life, he never, from that hour, ceased to have\na solemn sense of the verities of the Christian religion.\n\nAt Oxford, he paid little attention to his regular tasks, but read, or\nrather devoured, all the books he could lay his hands on, and began to\ndisplay his unrivalled conversational powers, being often seen\n\"lounging about the college gates, with a circle of young students\naround him, whom he was entertaining with wit, keeping from their\nstudies, and sometimes rousing to rebellion against the college\ndiscipline.\" He was, at this time, so miserably poor, that his shoes\nwere worn to tatters, and his feet appeared through them, to the\nscandal of the Christ-Church men, when he occasionally visited their\ncollege. Some compassionate individual laid a new pair at his door,\nwhich he tossed away with indignation. At last,--his debts increasing,\nhis supplies diminishing, and his father becoming bankrupt,--he was,\nin autumn 1731, compelled to leave college without a degree. In the\nDecember of the same year his father died.\n\nPerhaps there was not now in broad Britain a person apparently more\nhelpless and hopeless than this tall, half-blind, half-mad, and wholly\nmiserable lad, with ragged shoes, and no degree, left suddenly\nfatherless in Lichfield. But he had a number of warm friends in his\nnative place, such as Captain Garrick, father of the actor, and\nGilbert Walmsley, Registrar of the Ecclesiastical Court, who would not\nsuffer him to starve outright. He had learning and genius; and he had,\nmoreover, under all his indolence and all his melancholy, an\nindomitable resolution, which needed only to be roused to make all\nobstacles melt before it. He knew that he was great and strong, and\nwould yet struggle into recognition. At first, however, nothing\noffered save the post of usher in a school at Market-Bosworth, which\nhe occupied long enough to learn to loathe the occupation with all his\nheart and soul, and mind and strength, but which he soon resigned, and\nwas again idle. He was invited next to spend some time with Mr\nHector, an early friend, who was residing in Birmingham. Here he\nbecame acquainted with one Porter, a mercer, whose widow he afterwards\nmarried. Here, too, he executed his first literary work,--a\ntranslation of Lobo's \"Voyage to Abyssinia,\" which was published in\n1735, and for which he received the munificent sum of five guineas! He\nhad previously, without success, issued proposals for an edition of\nthe Latin poems of Politian; and, with a similar result, offered the\nservice of his pen to Edward Cave, the editor and publisher of the\n_Gentleman's Magazine_, to which he afterwards became a leading\ncontributor.\n\nShortly after this, Porter dying, Johnson married the widow--a lady\nmore distinguished for sense, and particularly for _the_ sense to\nappreciate his talents, than for personal charms, and who was twice\nher husband's age. It does not seem to have been a very happy match,\nalthough, probably, both parties loved each other better than they\nimagined. He was now assisted by his wife's portion, which amounted to\nL800, and opened a private academy at Echal, near Lichfield, but\nobtained only three pupils,--a Mr Offely, who died early, the\ncelebrated David Garrick, and his brother George. At the end of a year\nand a half, disgusted alike with the duties of the office, and with\nhis want of success in their discharge, Johnson left for London, with\nDavid Garrick for his companion, and reached it with one letter of\nintroduction from Gilbert Walmsley, three acts of the tragedy of\n\"Irene,\" and (according to his fellow-traveller) threepence-halfpenny\nin his pocket!\n\nTo London he had probably looked as to the great mart of genius, but\nat first he met with mortifying disappointment. He made one\ninfluential friend, however, in an officer named Henry Hervey, of whom\nhe said, \"He was a vicious man, but very kind to me; were you to call\na dog Hervey, I shall love him.\" In summer he came back to Lichfield,\nwhere he stayed three months, and finished his tragedy. He returned to\nLondon in autumn, along with his wife, and tried, but in vain, to get\n\"Irene\" presented on the stage. This did not happen till 1749, when\nhis old pupil David Garrick had become manager of Drury Lane Theatre.\n\nIn March 1738, he began to contribute to the _Gentleman's Magazine_, a\nmagazine he had long admired, and the original printing-place of\nwhich--St John's Gate--he \"beheld with reverence\" when he first passed\nit. Amidst the variety of his contributions, the most remarkable were\nhis \"Debates in the Senate of Lilliput\"--vigorous paraphrases of the\nparliamentary discussions--of which Johnson finding the mere skeleton\ngiven him by the reporters, was at the pains of clothing it with the\nflesh and blood of his own powerful diction. In May of the same year\nappeared his noble imitation of Juvenal, \"London,\" which at once made\nhim famous. After it had been rejected by several publishers, it was\nbought by Dodsley for ten guineas. It came out the same morning with\nPope's satire, entitled \"1738,\" and excited a much greater sensation.\nThe buzzing question ran, \"What great unknown genius can this be?\" The\npoem went to a second edition in a week; and Pope himself, who had\nread it with pleasure, when told that its author was an obscure man\nnamed Johnson, replied, \"He will soon be _deterre_.\"\n\nFamous as he had now become, he continued poor; and tired to death of\nslaving for the booksellers, he applied, through the influence of Pope\nand Lord Gower, to procure a degree from Dublin, that it might aid him\nin his application for a school at Appleby, in Leicestershire. In\nthis, however, he failed, and had to persevere for many years more in\nthe ill-paid drudgery of authorship--meditating a translation of\n\"Father Paul's History,\" which was never executed--writing in the\n_Gentleman's Magazine_ lives of Boeerhaave and Father Paul, &c., &c.,\n&c.--and published separately \"Marmor Norfolciense,\" a disguised\ninvective against Sir Robert Walpole, the obnoxious premier of the\nday. About this time he became intimate with the notorious Richard\nSavage, and with him spent too many of his private hours. Both were\npoor, both proud, both patriotic, both at that time lovers of\npleasure, and they became for a season inseparable; often\nperambulating the streets all night, engaged now, we fear, in low\nrevels, and now in high talk, and sometimes determined to stand by\ntheir country when they could stand by nothing else. Yet, if Savage\nfor a season corrupted Johnson, he also communicated to him much\ninformation, and at last left himself in legacy, as one of the best\nsubjects to one of the greatest masters of moral anatomy. In 1744,\nJohnson rolled off from his powerful pen, with as much ease as a thick\noak a thunder-shower, the sounding sentences which compose the \"Life\nof Savage,\" and which shall for ever perpetuate the memory and the\ntale of that \"unlucky rascal.\" It is a wasp preserved in the richest\namber. The whole reads like one sentence, and is generally read at one\nsitting. Sir Joshua Reynolds, meeting it in a country inn, began to\nread it while standing with his arm leaning on a chimney-piece, and\nwas not able to lay it aside till he had finished it, when he found\nhis arm totally benumbed. In 1745, Johnson issued proposals for a new\nedition of Shakspeare, but laid them aside for a time, owing to the\ngreat expectations entertained of the edition then promised by\nWarburton.\n\nFor several years, except a few trifles in the _Gentleman's Magazine_,\nand his famous \"Prologue delivered at the Opening of Drury Lane\nTheatre,\" he seems to have written nothing. But in 1745 appeared the\nprospectus of his most laborious undertaking, the \"English\nDictionary.\" This continued his principal occupation for some years,\nand, as Boswell truly observes, \"served to relieve his constitutional\nmelancholy by the steady, yet not oppressive, employment it secured\nhim.\" In its unity, too, and gigantic size, the task seemed fitted for\nthe powers of so strong a man; and although he says he dismissed it at\nlast with \"frigid tranquillity,\" he had no doubt felt its influence\nduring the time to be at once that of a protecting guardian and of an\ninspiring genius. In 1749, he published his \"Vanity of Human Wishes,\"\nfor which he received the sum of fifteen guineas,--a miserable\nrecompense for a poem which Byron pronounces \"sublime,\" and which is\nas true as it is magnificent in thought, and terse in language. In the\nsame year, Garrick had \"Irene\" acted, but it was \"damned\" the first\nnight, although it dragged on heavily for eight nights more. When the\nauthor was asked how he felt at its ill-success, he replied, \"Like the\nMonument!\" How different from Addison, walking restlessly, and\nperspiring with anxiety behind the scenes, while the fate of \"Cato\"\nwas hanging in the balance!\n\nIn 1750 he began his \"Rambler,\" and carried it on with only tolerable\nsuccess till 1752. The world has long ago made up its mind on the\nmerits and defects of this periodical, its masculine thought and\nenergetic diction, alternating with disguised common-place and (as he\nwould have said himself) \"turgescent tameness\"--its critical and\nfictitious papers, often so rich in fancy, and felicitous in\nexpression, mixed with others which exhibit \"bulk without spirit\nvast,\" and are chiefly remarkable for their bold, bad innovations on\nthat English tongue of which the author was piling up the standard\nDictionary. Many have dwelt severely on Johnson's inequalities,\nwithout attending to their cause; that was unquestionably the \"body of\ndeath\" which hung so heavily upon his system, and rendered writing at\ntimes a positive torment. Let his fastidious critics remember that he\nnever spent a single day, of which he could say that he was entirely\nwell, and free from pain, and that his spirits were often so\ndepressed, that he was more than once seen on his knees, praying God\nto preserve his understanding.\n\nA great calamity now visited his household. This was the death of his\nwife. She expired on the 17th of March 1752. She had been married to\nhim sixteen years; and notwithstanding the difference of age, and\nother causes of disagreement, he seems to have loved her with\nsincerity, and to have lamented her death with deep and long-continued\nsorrow. He relaxed not, however, an instant in his literary labours,\ncontinued the preparation of his Dictionary, and contributed a few\nlively and vigorous papers to the \"Adventurer\"--a paper, edited by Dr\nHawkesworth, a writer of some talent, who did his best to tower up to\nthe measure and stature of the \"Rambler.\"\n\nDuring this time Johnson was filling his house with a colony of poor\ndependants,--such as Mrs Anna Williams, a soured female poetaster; and\nLevet, a tenth-rate medical peripatetic, who, as well as Hodge, the\ngreat lexicographer's cat, and Francis Barber, his black servant, now\nshare in his immortality,--besides becoming acquainted with such men\nof eminence as Reynolds, the inimitable painter; Bennet Langton, the\namiable and excellent country-gentleman; and Beauclerk, the smart and\nwitty \"man about town.\" In 1755 (exactly a hundred years ago), Johnson\nchastised Lord Chesterfield for his mean, finessing conduct to him\nabout his Dictionary, in a letter unparalleled, unless in \"Junius,\"\nfor its noble and condensed scorn,--a scorn which \"burns frore,\" cold\nperforming the effect of fire--and which reached that callous Lord,\nunder the sevenfold shield of his conceit and conventionalism; visited\nOxford, and was presented by acclamation with that degree of M.A.\nwhich he had left twenty-four years before without receiving; and, in\nfine, issued his Dictionary, the work of eight years, and which,\nundoubtedly, is the truest monument of his talent, industry, and\ngeneral capacity, if not of the richness of his invention, or of the\nstrength of his genius. He had obtained for it only the sum of L1575,\nwhich was all spent in the progress of the work; and he was compelled\nagain to become a contributor to the periodical press, writing\ncopiously and characteristically to the _Gentleman's Magazine_, the\n_Universal Visitor_, and the _Literary Magazine_. In 1756, he was\narrested for a debt of L5, 18s., but was relieved by Richardson, the\nnovelist. In the same year he resumed his intention of an edition of\nShakspeare, of which he issued proposals, and which he promised to\nfinish in little more than a year, although nine years were to elapse\nere it saw the light. In 1758, he began the \"Idler,\" which reached the\n103d No., and was considered lighter and more agreeable than the\n\"Rambler.\" He has seldom written anything so powerful as his fable of\n\"The Vultures.\" In 1759, his mother died, at the age of ninety,--an\nevent which deeply affected him. Soon after this, and to defray the\nexpenses of her funeral, he wrote his brilliant tale of \"Rasselas,\" in\nthe evenings of a single week,--a rare feat of readiness and rapid\npower, reminding one of Byron writing the \"Corsair\" in a fortnight,\nand of Sir Walter Scott finishing \"Guy Mannering\" in three weeks.\nThere are perhaps more invention and more fancy in \"Rasselas\" than in\nany of his works, although a gloom, partly the shadow of his mother's\ndeath, and partly springing from his own temperament, rests too\nheavily on its pages. He received one hundred guineas for the\ncopyright. In 1762, the Earl of Bute, both as a reward for past\nservices, and as a prepayment of future, bestowed on him a pension of\nL300 for life. This raised a clamour against him, which he treated\nwith silent contempt.\n\nIn 1763 occurred what was really a most important event in Johnson's\nlife,--his acquaintance with Boswell,--who attached himself to him\nwith a devotion reminding one more of the canine species than of man,\nsacrificed to him much of his time, his feelings, his very\nindividuality, and became qualified to write a biography, in which\nfulness, interest, minute detail, and dramatic skill have never been\nequalled or approached. In 1764, Johnson founded the celebrated\n\"Literary Club,\"--perhaps the most remarkable cluster of distinguished\nmen that ever existed; and in 1765 he was created LL.D. by Trinity\nCollege, Dublin. In 1765, too, he published his \"Shakspeare;\" and he\nbecame intimate with the Thrales,--the husband being a great brewer in\nSouthwark; the wife, a lady of literary tastes, better known as Madame\nPiozzi, the author of \"Anecdotes of Dr Johnson;\" both distinguished\nfor their attachment to him. He was often domesticated in their house\nfor months together. In 1767 he had an interview with George III., in\nthe library of the Queen's house; which, because Johnson preserved his\nself-possession, and talked with his usual precision and power, has\nbeen recounted by Boswell as if it had been a conversation with an\napostle or an angel. In 1770 he did some work for his pension in a\npamphlet entitled the \"False Alarm,\" defending the conduct of the\nMinistry in the case of the Middlesex election. In 1771 he wrote\nanother political pamphlet, entitled \"Thoughts on the late\nTransactions respecting Falklands' Islands;\" and five years later\nappeared \"Taxation no Tyranny,\"--an elaborate defence of the American\nwar. Johnson was too dogmatic, and too fiercely passionate for a good\npolitical writer; and these productions added nothing to his fame, and\nincreased the number of his enemies.\n\nIn 1773 he fulfilled his long-cherished purpose of visiting Scotland\nand the Hebrides, the story of which trip he told afterwards in his\nusual rotund and massive style, and which was recounted with far more\nliveliness and verisimilitude by Boswell. In 1774 he lost Goldsmith,\nwho had long been his friend, whom he had counselled, rebuked,\nassisted, loved, and laughed at, and at whose death he was deeply\ngrieved. In 1775, the publication of his \"Tour to the Hebrides\"\nbrought him in collision with the _perfervidum ingenium Scotorum_, and\nespecially with James Macpherson, to whom Johnson sent a letter which\ncrushed him like a catapult. Macpherson, as well as Rob Roy, was only\nstrong on his native heath, and off it was no match for old Sam, whose\nprejudices, passions, and gigantic powers, combined to make him\naltogether irresistible in a literary duel. The same year, the\nUniversity of Oxford conferred on him the degree of Doctor of Laws;\nand in the close of it, he paid a visit, along with the Thrales,\nto Paris.\n\nIn 1776 nothing remarkable occurred in his history, unless it were the\ninterview which Boswell so admirably manoeuvred to bring about between\nhim and Jack Wilkes. Everybody remembers how well the bear and the\nmonkey for the time agreed, and how both turned round to snub the\nspaniel, who had been the medium of their introduction to each other.\n\nIn 1777 he was requested by the London booksellers to prefix prefaces\nto the \"English Poets,\" part of which was issued the next year, and\nthe rest in 1780 and 1781, as the \"Lives of English Poets.\" This work\nhas generally been regarded as Johnson's masterpiece. It nowhere,\nindeed, displays so much of the creative, the inventive, the poetical,\nas his \"Rasselas,\" and many of his smaller tales and fictions. Its\njudgments, too, have been often and justly controverted. The book is,\nundoubtedly, a storehouse of his prejudices, as well as of his wisdom.\nIts treatment of Milton, the man, for instance, is insufferably\ninsolent, although ample justice is done to Milton, the poet of the\n\"Paradise Lost.\" Some poetasters he has overpraised, and some true but\nminor poets he has thrust down too far in the scale. But the work, as\na whole, is full of inextinguishable life, and has passages verging on\nthe eloquence and power of genius. A piece of stern, sober, yet broad\nand animated composition, rather careless in dates, and rather cursory\nin many of its criticisms, it displays unequalled force of thought,\nand pointed vigour of style, and when taken in connexion with the age\nof the author (seventy), is altogether marvellous. Truly there were\n\"giants in those days,\" and this was a Briareus.\n\nFor the details of his later life, his conversations, growing\nweakness, little journeys, unconquerable love of literature, &c., we\nmust refer our readers to Boswell's teeming narrative. In 1783, he had\na stroke of palsy, which deprived him for a time of speech. That\nreturned to him, however, but a complication of complaints, including\nasthma, sciatica, and dropsy, began gradually to undermine his\npowerful frame. He continued to the last to cherish the prospect of a\ntour to Italy, but never accomplished his purpose. Death had all along\nbeen his great object of dread, and its fast approaches were regarded\nwith unmitigated terror. \"Cut deeper,\" he cried to the physicians who\nwere operating on his limbs; \"cut deeper; I don't care for pain, but I\nfear death.\" He fixed all his dying hope upon the Cross, and\nrecommended Clarke's Sermons as fullest on the doctrine of a\nPropitiation. He spoke of the Bible and of the Sabbath with the\nwarmest feelings of belief and respect. At last, on the 13th day of\nDecember 1784, in the seventy-fifth year of his age, this great, good\nman, whose fears had subsided, and who had become as a little child,\nfell asleep in Jesus. He was buried in Westminster Abbey, on Monday,\nDecember 20th, and his funeral was attended by the most distinguished\nmen of the day.\n\nPerhaps no literary man ever exerted, during his lifetime, the same\npersonal influence as Samuel Johnson. Shelley used to call Byron the\n\"Byronic Energy,\" from a sense of his exceeding power. The author of\n\"Rasselas\" was the \"Johnsonian Energy;\" and the demon within him, if\nnot so ethereal and terrible as Byron's, was far more massive, equally\nstrong, and in conversation, at least, much more ready to do his work.\nFirst-rate conversation generally springs from a desire to shine, or\nfrom the effort of a full mind to relieve itself, or from exuberant\nanimal spirits, or from deep-seated misery. In Johnson it sprang from\na combination of all these causes. He went to conversation as to an\narena--his mind was richly-stored, even to overflowing--in company his\nspirits uniformly rose--and yet there was always at his heart a burden\nof wretchedness, seeking solace, not in silence, but in speech. Hence,\nwith the exception of Burke, no one ever matched him in talk; and\nBurke, we imagine, although profounder in thought, more varied in\nlearning, and more brilliant in imagination, seldom fairly pitted\nhimself against Johnson. He was a younger man, and held the sage in\ntoo much reverence to encounter him often with any deliberate and\ndetermined purpose of contest. He frequently touched the shield of the\ngeneral challenger, not with the sharp, but with the butt-end of his\nlance. He said, on one occasion, when asked why he had not talked more\nin Johnson's company, \"Oh! it is enough for me to have rung the\nbell to him!\"\n\nIn all Johnson's works you see the traces of the triumphant\nconversationalist--of one who has met with few to contradict, and\nscarcely one to rival him. Hence the dogmatic strength and certainty,\nand hence, too, the one-sidedness and limitation of much of his\nwritings. He does not \"allow for the wind.\" He seems to anticipate no\nreply, and to defy all criticism. One is tempted to quote the words of\nSolomon, \"He that is first in his own cause seemeth just, but his\nneighbour cometh and searcheth him.\" No such searching seems ever to\nhave entered into Johnson's apprehensions. His sentences roll forth\nlike the laws of the Medes and Persians; his praise alights with the\nauthoritativeness of a sun-burst on a mountain; summit; and when he\nblames, he seems to add, like an ancient doomster, the words, \"I\npronounce for doom.\" With Burke, it was very different. Accustomed to\nparliamentary debate in its vicissitudes and interchange--gifted, too,\nwith a prophetic insight into coming objections, which \"cast their\nshadows before,\" and with an almost diseased subtlety of thinking, he\nbinds up his answers to opponents with every thesis he propounds; and\nhis paragraphs sometimes remind you of the plan of generals in great\nemergencies, putting foot soldiers on the same saddles with\ncavalry--they seem to _ride double_.\n\nThis is not the place, nor have we room, to dilate on Johnson's\nobvious merits and faults--his straight-forward sincerity--his strong\nmanly sense--the masterly force with which he grasps all his\nsubjects--the measured fervour of his style--the precision and\nvivacity of his shorter sentences--the grand swell and sonorousness of\nhis longer; on his frequent monotony--his _sesguipedalia verba_--the\n\"timorous meaning\" which sometimes lurks under his \"boldest words;\" or\non the deep _chiaroscuro_ which discolours all his pictures of man,\nnature, society, and human life. We have now only to speak of his\npoetry. That is, unfortunately, small in amount, although its quality\nis so excellent as to excite keen regret that he had not, as he once\nintended, written many more pieces in the style of \"London,\" and the\n\"Vanity of Human Wishes.\" In these, the model of his mere manner is\nPope, although  by Juvenal, his Latin original; but the matter\nand spirit are intensely his own. In \"London,\" satire seems swelling\nout of itself into something stronger and statelier--it is the\napotheosis of that kind of poetry. You see in it a mind purer and\nsterner than Dryden's, or Pope's, or Churchill's, or even Juvenal's;\n\"doing well to be angry\" with a degenerate age, and a false, cowardly\ncountry, of which he deems himself unworthy to be a citizen. If there\nis rather too much of the _saeva indignatio_, which Swift speaks of as\nlacerating his heart, it is a nobler and less selfish ire than his,\nand the language and verse which it inspires are full of the very soul\nof dignity. In the \"Vanity of Human Wishes,\" he becomes one of those\n\"hunters whose game is man\" (to use the language of Soame Jenyns, in\nthat essay on \"The Origin of Evil,\" which Johnson, in the _Literary\nReview_, so mercilessly lashed); and from assailing premiers,\nparliaments, and the vices of London and England, he passes, in a very\nsolemn spirit, to expose the vain hopes, wishes, and efforts of\nhumanity at large. Parts of this poem are written more in sorrow than\nin anger, and parts more in anger than in sorrow. The portraits of\nWolsey, Bacon, and Charles the Twelfth, are admirable in their\nexecution, and in their adaptation to the argument of the piece; and\nthe last paragraph, for truth and masculine energy is unsurpassed, we\nbelieve, in the whole compass of ethical poetry. We are far from\nassenting to the statement we once heard ably and elaborately\nadvocated, \"that there had been no _strong_ poetry in Britain since\nthe two satires of Johnson;\" and we are still further from classing\ntheir author with the Shakspeares, Miltons, Wordsworths, and\nColeridges of song; but we are nevertheless prepared, not only for the\nsake of these two satires, of his prologue, and of some other pieces\nin verse, but on account of the general spirit of much of his prose,\nto pronounce him potentially, if not actually, a great poet.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJOHNSON'S POEMS.\n\n\nLONDON:\n\n  A POEM IN IMITATION OF THE THIRD SATIRE OF JUVENAL, 1738.\n\n                     \"--Quis ineptae\n  Tam patiens urbis, tam ferreus ut teneat se?\"\n\n   --JUVENAL.\n\n  Though grief and fondness in my breast rebel\n  When injured Thales[1] bids the town farewell,\n  Yet still my calmer thoughts his choice commend;\n  I praise the hermit, but regret the friend;\n  Resolved, at length, from vice and London far,\n  To breathe in distant fields a purer air,\n  And, fix'd on Cambria's solitary shore,\n  Give to St David one true Briton more.\n\n   For who would leave, unbribed, Hibernia's land,\n  Or change the rocks of Scotland for the Strand?              10\n  There none are swept by sudden fate away,\n  But all whom hunger spares, with age decay:\n  Here malice, rapine, accident, conspire,\n  And now a rabble rages, now a fire;\n  Their ambush here relentless ruffians lay,\n  And here the fell attorney prowls for prey;\n  Here falling houses thunder on your head,\n  And here a female atheist talks you dead.\n\n   While Thales waits the wherry that contains\n  Of dissipated wealth the small remains,                      20\n  On Thames's bank in silent thought we stood,\n  Where Greenwich smiles upon the silver flood;\n  Struck with the seat that gave Eliza[2] birth,\n  We kneel and kiss the consecrated earth;\n  In pleasing dreams the blissful age renew,\n  And call Britannia's glories back to view;\n  Behold her cross triumphant on the main,\n  The guard of commerce, and the dread of Spain;\n  Ere masquerades debauch'd, excise oppress'd,\n  Or English honour grew a standing jest.                      30\n\n   A transient calm the happy scenes bestow,\n  And for a moment lull the sense of woe.\n  At length awaking, with contemptuous frown,\n  Indignant Thales eyes the neighbouring town.\n  Since worth, he cries, in these degenerate days,\n  Wants e'en the cheap reward of empty praise;\n  In those cursed walls, devote to vice and gain,\n  Since unrewarded science toils in vain;\n  Since hope but soothes to double my distress,\n  And every moment leaves my little less;                      40\n  While yet my steady steps no staff sustains,\n  And life, still vigorous, revels in my veins,\n  Grant me, kind Heaven!

A. POPE.\n\n\nTHE LIFE AND POETRY OF THOMAS PARNELL.\n\nParnell is the third in a trio of poetical clergymen whose names have\nimmediately succeeded each other in this edition. Bowles, Churchill,\nand Parnell were all clergymen, and all poets; but in other respects\ndiffered materially from each other. In Bowles, the clerical and the\npoetical characters were on the whole well attuned and harmonised. In\nChurchill, they came to an open rupture. In Parnell, they were neither\nruptured nor reconciled, but maintained an ambiguous relation, till\nhis premature death settled the moot point for ever.\n\nThe life of this poet has been written by Goldsmith, by Johnson, by\nthe Rev. John Mitford, and others; but, after all, very little is\nknown about him. Thomas Parnell was the descendant of an ancient\nfamily, which had been settled for some hundreds of years at\nCongleton, Cheshire. His father, whose name also was Thomas, took the\nside of the Commonwealth, and at the Restoration went over to Ireland,\nwhere he purchased a considerable property. This, along with his\nestate in Cheshire, devolved to the poet. His father had a second son,\nJohn, whose descendants were created baronets. The late Sir Henry\nParnell, for some years the respected member of Parliament for the\ntown of Dundee, where we now write, was the great-great-grandson of\nthe poet's father. Parnell was born in Dublin, in the year 1679. He\nwas sent to a school taught by one Dr Jones. Here he is said to have\ndistinguished himself by the readiness and retentiveness of his\nmemory; often performing the task allotted for days in a few hours,\nand being able to repeat forty lines in any book of poems, after the\nfirst reading. It is a proof of the prematurity of his powers, that he\nentered Trinity College, Dublin, at the age of thirteen, where his\ncompositions attracted attention from the extent of classical lore\nwhich they discovered. He took the degree of M.A. in 1700; and the\nsame year (through a dispensation on account of being under age) was\nordained deacon by the Bishop of Deny. Three years after, he was\nordained priest; and in 1705, he was made Archdeacon of Clogher, by\nSir George Ashe, bishop of that see. So soon as he received the\narchdeanery, he married Miss Ann Minchin, who is described as a young\nlady of great beauty, and of an amiable character, by whom he had two\nsons, who died young, and a daughter, who long survived both\nher parents.\n\nUp to the triumph of the Tories, at the end of Queen Anne's reign,\nParnell appears to have been, like his father, a keen Whig. He was at\nthat time, however, induced, for motives which his biographers call\nobscure, but which to us seem obvious enough, on the well-known\nprinciple of the popularity of the rising sun, to change his party;\nand he was hailed by the Tories as a valuable accession to their\nranks. This proves that his talents were even then known; a fact\ncorroborated by Johnson's statement, that while he was waiting in the\nouter-room at Lord Oxford's levee, the prime minister, when told he\nwas there, went out, at the persuasion of Swift, with his treasurer's\nstaff in his hand, and saluted him in the most flattering manner. He\nbecame, either before or immediately after this, intimate with Pope,\nSwift, Gay, and the rest of that brilliant set, who all appear to have\nloved him for his social qualities, to have admired his genius, and to\nhave pitied his infirmities. He was a member of the Scriblerus Club,\nand contributed some trifles to their transactions. He was, at the\nsame time, intimate with Addison and Steele, and wrote a few papers in\nthe \"Spectator.\" To Pope, he was of essential service, assisting him\nin his notes to the \"Iliad,\" being, what Pope was not, a good Greek\nscholar. He wrote a life of Homer, which was prefixed to the\nTranslation, although stiff in style, and fabulous in statement. He\ngratified Pope's malicious spirit still more by writing, under the\nguise of a \"Life of Zoilus,\" a bitter attack on Dennis--the great\nobject of the poet's fear and mortal abhorrence. For these and other\nservices, Pope rewarded him, after his usual manner, with large\nofferings of that sweet and suffocating incense, by which he\ndelighted, now to gain his enemies, and now to gratify his friends.\nWith Gay, also, Parnell was intimate; and the latter, himself\nindependent by his fortune, is said to have bestowed on this needy and\nimprovident genius the price of the copyright of his works.\n\nParnell first visited London in 1706; and from that period till his\ndeath, scarcely a year elapsed without his spending some time in the\nmetropolis. He seems to have had as intense a relish of London life as\nJohnson and Boswell exhibited in the next age. So soon as he had\ncollected his rents, he hied to the capital, and there enjoyed himself\nto the top of his bent. He jested with the Scriblerus Club. He quaffed\nnow and then with Lord Oxford. He varied his round of amusements by\noccasional professional exhibitions in the pulpits of Southwark and\nelsewhere,--made, we fear, more from a desire to display himself, than\nto benefit his hearers. Still his sermons were popular; and he\nentertained at one time the hope,--a hope blasted by the death of\nQueen Anne,--of being preferred to a city charge. So soon as each\nLondon furlough was expired, he returned to Ireland, jaded and\ndispirited, and there took delight in nursing his melancholy; in\npining for the amusements of the metropolis; in shunning and sneering\nat the society around him; and in abusing his native bogs and his\nfellow-countrymen in verse. This was not manly, far less Christian\nconduct. He ought to have drowned his recollections of London in\nactive duty, or in diligent study; and if he found society coarse or\ncorrupt, he should have set himself to refine and to purify it. But he\nseems to have been a lazy, luxurious person--his life a round of\nselfish rapture and selfish anguish,--in fact, ruined by his\nindependent fortune. Had he been a poorer, he had probably been a\nhappier man. He was not, moreover, of that self-contained cast of\ncharacter, which can live on its own resources, create its own world,\nand say, \"My mind to me a kingdom is.\"\n\nIn 1712 he lost his wife, with whom he appears to have lived as\nhappily as his morbid temperament and mortified feelings would permit.\nThis blow deepened his melancholy, and drove him, it is said, to an\nexcessive and habitual use of wine. In the same year we find him in\nLondon, brought out once more under the \"special patronage\" of Dean\nSwift, who had quite a penchant for Parnell, and who wished, through\nhis side, to mortify certain persons in Ireland, who did not\nappreciate, he says, the Archdeacon; and who, we suspect, besides, did\nnot thoroughly appreciate the Dean. Swift, partly in pity for the\n\"poor lad,\" as he calls him, whom he saw to be in such imminent danger\nof losing caste and character, and partly in the true patronising\nspirit, introduced Parnell to Lord Bolingbroke, who received him\nkindly, entertained him at dinner, and encouraged him in his poetical\nstudies. The Dean's patronage, however, was of little avail in this\nmatter to the protege; Bolingbroke, a man of many promises, and few\nperformances, did nothing for him. The consequences of dissipation\nbegan, at this time, too, to appear in Parnell's constitution; and we\nfind Swift saying of him, \"His head is out of order, like mine, but\nmore constant, poor boy.\" It was perhaps to this period that Pope\nreferred, when he told Spence, \"Parnell is a great follower of drams,\nand strangely open and scandalous in his debaucheries.\" If so, his bad\nhabits seem to have sprung as much from disappointment and discontent\nas from taste.\n\nYet Swift continued his friend, and it was at his instance that, in\n1713, Archbishop King presented Parnell with a prebend. In 1714, his\nhope of London promotion died with Queen Anne; but in 1716, the same\ngenerous Archbishop bestowed on him the vicarage of Finglass, in the\ndiocese of Dublin, worth L400 a-year. This preferment, however, the\npoet did not live long to enjoy,--dying at Chester, in July\n1717, on his way to Ireland, aged thirty-eight years. His estates\npassed to his nephew, Sir John Parnell. He had, in the course of his\nlife, composed a great deal of poetry; much of it, indeed, _invita_\nMinerva. After his death, Pope collected the best pieces, and\npublished them, with a dedication to Lord Oxford. Goldsmith, in his\nedition, added two or three; and other editors, a good many poems, of\nwhich we have only inserted one, deeming the rest unworthy of his\nmemory. In 1788 a volume was published, entitled, \"The Posthumous\nWorks of Dr T. Parnell, containing poems moral and divine.\" These,\nhowever, attracted little attention, being mostly rubbish. Johnson\nsays of them, \"I know not whence they came, nor have ever inquired\nwhither they are going.\" It is said that the present representative of\nthe Parnell family preserves a mass of unpublished poems from the pen\nof his relative. We trust that he will long and religiously refrain\nfrom disturbing their MS. slumbers.\n\nThe whole tenor of Parnell's history convinces us that he was an\neasy-tempered, kind-hearted, yet querulous and self-indulgent man, who\nhad no higher motive or object than to gratify himself. His very\nambition aspired not to very lofty altitudes. His utmost wish was to\nattain a metropolitan pulpit, where he could have added the reputation\nof a popular preacher to that of being the _protege_ of Swift, and the\npet of the Scriblerus Club. The character of his poetry is in keeping\nwith the temperament of the man. It is slipshod, easy, and pleasing.\nIf the distinguishing quality of poetry be to give pleasure, then\nParnell is a poet. You never thrill under his power, but you read him\nwith a quiet, constant, subdued gratification. If never eminently\noriginal, he has the art of enunciating common-places with felicity and\ngrace. The stories he relates are almost all old, but his manner of\ntelling them is new. His thoughts and images are mostly selected from\nhis common-place book; but he utters them with such a natural ease of\nmanner, that you are tempted to think them his own. He knows the\ncompass of his poetical powers, and never attempts anything very lofty\nor arduous. His \"Allegory on Man,\"--pronounced by Johnson his\nbest,--seems rather a laborious than a fortunate effusion. His \"Hymn\nto Contentment\" is animated, as the subject required, by a kind of\nsober rapture. His \"Faery Tale\" is a good imitation of that old style\nof composition. His \"Hesiod\" catches the classical tone and spirit\nwith considerable success. His \"Flies,\" and \"Elegy to the Old Beauty,\"\nare ingenious trifles. His \"Nightpiece on Death\" has fine touches, but\nis slight for such a theme, and must not be named beside Blair's\n\"Grave,\" and Gray's \"Elegy written in a Country Churchyard.\" His\ntranslations we have, in accordance with the plan of this edition,\nomitted--and, indeed, they are little loss. His \"Bookworm,\" &c., are\nadaptations from Beza and other foreign authors. By far his most\npopular poem is the \"Hermit.\" In it he tells a tale that had been told\nin Arabic, French, and English, for the tenth time; and in that tenth\nedition tells it so well, that the public have thanked him for it as\nfor an original work. Of course, the story not being Parnell's, it is\nnot his fault that it casts no light upon the dread problems of\nProvidence it professed to explain. But the incidents are recorded\nwith ease and liveliness; the characters are rapidly depicted, and\nstrikingly contrasted; and many touches of true poetry occur.\nHow vivid this couplet, for instance--\n\n  \"Slow creaking turns the door with jealous care,\n  And half he welcomes in the shivering pair!\"\n\nHow picturesque the following--\n\n  \"A fresher green the smiling leaves display,\n  And, _glittering as they tremble_, cheer the day!\"\n\nThe description of the unveiled angel approaches the\nsublime--\n\n  \"Fair rounds of radiant points invest his hair;\n  Celestial odours breathe through purpled air;\n  And wings, whose colours glitter'd on the day,\n  Wide at his back, their gradual plumes display.\n  The form ethereal bursts upon his sight,\n  And moves in all the majesty of light.\"\n\nA passage of similar brilliance occurs in \"Piety, or the\nVision\"--\n\n  \"A sudden splendour seem'd to kindle day;\n  A breeze came breathing in; a sweet perfume,\n  _Blown from eternal gardens_, fill'd the room,\n  And in a void of blue, that clouds invest,\n  Appear'd a daughter of the realms of rest.\"\n\nSuch passages themselves are enough to prove Parnell a\ntrue poet.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPARNELL'S POEMS.\n\n\n  HESIOD; OR, THE RISE OF WOMAN.\n\n  What ancient times, those times we fancy wise,\n  Have left on long record of woman's rise,\n  What morals teach it, and what fables hide,\n  What author wrote it, how that author died,--\n  All these I sing. In Greece they framed the tale;\n  (In Greece, 'twas thought a woman might be frail);\n  Ye modern beauties! where the poet drew\n  His softest pencil, think he dreamt of you;\n  And warn'd by him, ye wanton pens, beware\n  How Heaven's concern'd to vindicate the fair.               10\n  The case was Hesiod's; he the fable writ--\n  Some think with meaning--some, with idle wit:\n  Perhaps 'tis either, as the ladies please;\n  I waive the contest, and commence the lays.\n\n   In days of yore, no matter where or when,\n  'Twas ere the low creation swarm'd with men,\n  That one Prometheus, sprung of heavenly birth\n  (Our author's song can witness), lived on earth.\n  He carved the turf to mould a manly frame,\n  And stole from Jove his animating flame.                    20\n  The sly contrivance o'er Olympus ran,\n  When thus the Monarch of the Stars began:\n  'Oh versed in arts! whose daring thoughts aspire\n  To kindle clay with never-dying fire!\n  Enjoy thy glory past, that gift was thine;\n  The next thy creature meets, be fairly mine:\n  And such a gift, a vengeance so design'd,\n  As suits the counsel of a God to find;\n  A pleasing bosom cheat, a specious ill,\n  Which, felt, they curse, yet covet still to feel.'          30\n\n   He said, and Vulcan straight the sire commands\n  To temper mortar with ethereal hands;\n  In such a shape to mould a rising fair,\n  As virgin-goddesses are proud to wear;\n  To make her eyes with diamond-water shine,\n  And form her organs for a voice divine.\n  'Twas thus the sire ordain'd; the power obey'd;\n  And work'd, and wonder'd at the work he made;\n  The fairest, softest, sweetest frame beneath,\n  Now made to seem, now more than seem, to breathe.           40\n\n   As Vulcan ends, the cheerful queen of charms\n  Clasp'd the new-panting creature in her arms;\n  From that embrace a fine complexion spread,\n  Where mingled whiteness glow'd with softer red.\n  Then in a kiss she breathed her various arts,\n  Of trifling prettily with wounded hearts;\n  A mind for love, but still a changing mind;\n  The lisp affected, and the glance design'd;\n  The sweet confusing blush, the secret wink,\n  The gentle-swimming walk, the courteous sink,               50\n  The stare for strangeness fit, for scorn the frown,\n  For decent yielding, looks declining down,\n  The practised languish, where well-feign'd desire\n  Would own its melting in a mutual fire;\n  Gay smiles to comfort; April showers to move;\n  And all the nature, all the art, of love.\n\n   Gold-sceptred Juno next exalts the fair;\n  Her touch endows her with imperious air,\n  Self-valuing fancy, highly-crested pride,\n  Strong sovereign will, and some desire to chide:            60\n  For which an eloquence, that aims to vex,\n  With native tropes of anger arms the sex.\n\n   Minerva, skilful goddess, train'd the maid\n  To twirl the spindle by the twisting thread,\n  To fix the loom, instruct the reeds to part,\n  Cross the long weft, and close the web with art:\n  An useful gift; but what profuse expense,\n  What world of fashions, took its rise from hence!\n\n   Young Hermes next, a close-contriving god,\n  Her brows encircled with his serpent rod;                   70\n  Then plots, and fair excuses, fill'd her brain,\n  The views of breaking amorous vows for gain,\n  The price of favours, the designing arts\n  That aim at riches in contempt of hearts;\n  And for a comfort in the marriage life,\n  The little, pilfering temper of a wife.\n\n   Full on the fair his beams Apollo flung,\n  And fond persuasion tipp'd her easy tongue;\n  He gave her words, where oily flattery lays\n  The pleasing colours of the art of praise;                  80\n  And wit, to scandal exquisitely prone,\n  Which frets another's spleen to cure its own.\n\n   Those sacred virgins whom the bards revere,\n  Tuned all her voice, and shed a sweetness there,\n  To make her sense with double charms abound,\n  Or make her lively nonsense please by sound.\n\n   To dress the maid, the decent Graces brought\n  A robe in all the dyes of beauty wrought,\n  And placed their boxes o'er a rich brocade\n  Where pictured loves on every cover play'd;                 90\n  Then spread those implements that Vulcan's art\n  Had framed to merit Cytherea's heart;\n  The wire to curl, the close-indented comb,\n  To call the locks that lightly wander, home;\n  And chief, the mirror, where the ravish'd maid\n  Beholds and loves her own reflected shade.\n\n   Fair Flora lent her stores, the purpled hours\n  Confined her tresses with a wreath of flowers;\n  Within the wreath arose a radiant crown;\n  A veil pellucid hung depending down;                       100\n  Back roll'd her azure veil with serpent fold,\n  The purfled border deck'd the flower with gold.\n  Her robe (which, closely by the girdle braced,\n  Reveal'd the beauties of a slender waist)\n  Flow'd to the feet; to copy Venus' air,\n  When Venus' statues have a robe to wear.\n\n   The new-sprung creature finish'd thus for harms,\n  Adjusts her habit, practises her charms,\n  With blushes glows, or shines with lively smiles,\n  Confirms her will, or recollects her wiles:                110\n  Then conscious of her worth, with easy pace\n  Glides by the glass, and, turning, views her face.\n\n   A finer flax than what they wrought before,\n  Through Time's deep cave the sister Fates explore,\n  Then fix the loom, their fingers nimbly weave,\n  And thus their toil prophetic songs deceive:\n\n   'Flow from the rock, my flax! and swiftly flow,\n  Pursue thy thread, the spindle runs below.\n  A creature fond and changing, fair and vain,\n  The creature Woman, rises now to reign.                    120\n  New beauty blooms, a beauty form'd to fly;\n  New love begins, a love produced to die;\n  New parts distress the troubled scenes of life,\n  The fondling mistress, and the ruling wife.\n  Men, born to labour, all with pains provide;\n  Women have time to sacrifice to pride:\n  They want the care of man, their want they know,\n  And dress to please with heart-alluring show,\n  The show prevailing, for the sway contend,\n  And make a servant where they meet a friend.               130\n\n   Thus in a thousand wax-erected forts\n  A loitering race the painful bee supports,\n  From sun to sun, from bank to bank he flies,\n  With honey loads his bag, with wax his thighs,\n  Fly where he will, at home the race remain,\n  Prune the silk dress, and murmuring eat the gain.\n\n   Yet here and there we grant a gentle bride,\n  Whose temper betters by the father's side;\n  Unlike the rest, that double human care,\n  Fond to relieve, or resolute to share:                     140\n  Happy the man whom thus his stars advance!\n  The curse is general, but the blessing chance.'\n\n   Thus sung the Sisters, while the gods admire\n  Their beauteous creature, made for man, in ire;\n  The young Pandora she, whom all contend\n  To make too perfect not to gain her end:\n  Then bid the winds that fly to breathe the spring,\n  Return to bear her on a gentle wing;\n  With wafting airs the winds obsequious blow,\n  And land the shining vengeance safe below.                 150\n  A golden coffer in her hand she bore,\n  (The present treacherous, but the bearer more)\n  'Twas fraught with pangs; for Jove ordain'd above,\n  That gold should aid, and pangs attend on love.\n\n   Her gay descent the man perceived afar,\n  Wondering he ran to catch the falling star;\n  But so surprised, as none but he can tell,\n  Who loved so quickly, and who loved so well.\n  O'er all his veins the wandering passion burns,\n  He calls her nymph, and every nymph by turns.              160\n  Her form to lovely Venus he prefers,\n  Or swears that Venus must be such as hers.\n  She, proud to rule, yet strangely framed to tease,\n  Neglects his offers while her airs she plays,\n  Shoots scornful glances from the bended frown,\n  In brisk disorder trips it up and down,\n  Then hums a careless tune to lay the storm,\n  And sits and blushes, smiles, and yields in form.\n\n   'Now take what Jove design'd, (she softly cried,)\n  This box thy portion, and myself thy bride:'               170\n  Fired with the prospect of the double charms,\n  He snatch'd the box, and bride, with eager arms.\n\n   Unhappy man! to whom so bright she shone,\n  The fatal gift, her tempting self, unknown!\n  The winds were silent, all the waves asleep,\n  And heaven was traced upon the flattering deep;\n  But whilst he looks, unmindful of a storm,\n  And thinks the water wears a stable form,\n  What dreadful din around his ears shall rise!\n  What frowns confuse his picture of the skies!              180\n\n   At first the creature Man was framed alone,\n  Lord of himself, and all the world his own.\n  For him the Nymphs in green forsook the woods,\n  For him the Nymphs in blue forsook the floods;\n  In vain the Satyrs rage, the Tritons rave;\n  They bore him heroes in the secret cave.\n  No care destroy'd, no sick disorder prey'd,\n  No bending age his sprightly form decay'd,\n  No wars were known, no females heard to rage,\n  And poets tell us, 'twas a golden age.                     190\n\n   When woman came, those ills the box confined\n  Burst furious out, and poison'd all the wind,\n\n   From point to point, from pole to pole they flew,\n  Spread as they went, and in the progress grew:\n  The Nymphs, regretting, left the mortal race,\n  And, altering Nature, wore a sickly face:\n  New terms of folly rose, new states of care;\n  New plagues to suffer, and to please, the fair!\n  The days of whining, and of wild intrigues,\n  Commenced, or finish'd, with the breach of leagues;        200\n  The mean designs of well-dissembled love;\n  The sordid matches never join'd above;\n  Abroad, the labour, and at home the noise,\n  (Man's double sufferings for domestic joys)\n  The curse of jealousy; expense, and strife;\n  Divorce, the public brand of shameful life;\n  The rival's sword; the qualm that takes the fair;\n  Disdain for passion, passion in despair--\n  These, and a thousand yet unnamed, we find;\n  Ah, fear the thousand yet unnamed behind!                  210\n\n   Thus on Parnassus tuneful Hesiod sung,\n  The mountain echoed, and the valley rung,\n  The sacred groves a fix'd attention show,\n  The crystal Helicon forbore to flow,\n  The sky grew bright, and (if his verse be true)\n  The Muses came to give the laurel too.\n  But what avail'd the verdant prize of wit,\n  If Love swore vengeance for the tales he writ?\n  Ye fair offended, hear your friend relate\n  What heavy judgment proved the writer's fate,              220\n  Though when it happen'd, no relation clears;\n  'Tis thought in five, or five and twenty years.\n\n   Where, dark and silent, with a twisted shade\n  The neighbouring woods a native arbour made,\n  There oft a tender pair for amorous play\n  Retiring, toy'd the ravish'd hours away;\n  A Locrian youth, the gentle Troilus he,\n  A fair Milesian, kind Evanthe she:\n  But swelling Nature, in a fatal hour,\n  Betray'd the secrets of the conscious bower;               230\n  The dire disgrace her brothers count their own,\n  And track her steps, to make its author known.\n\n   It chanced one evening, ('twas the lover's day)\n  Conceal'd in brakes the jealous kindred lay;\n  When Hesiod, wandering, mused along the plain,\n  And fix'd his seat where Love had fix'd the scene:\n  A strong suspicion straight possess'd their mind,\n  (For poets ever were a gentle kind.)\n  But when Evanthe near the passage stood,\n  Flung back a doubtful look, and shot the wood,             240\n  'Now take (at once they cry) thy due reward!'\n  And, urged with erring rage, assault the bard.\n  His corpse the sea received.

easy breezes, softer rain,\n  And warmer suns salute the plain;\n  'Twas then, in yonder piny grove,\n  That Nature went to meet with Love.\n\n   Green was her robe, and green her wreath,\n  Where'er she trod, 'twas green beneath;\n  Where'er she turn'd, the pulses beat\n  With new recruits of genial heat;                           10\n  And in her train the birds appear,\n  To match for all the coming year.\n\n   Raised on a bank, where daisies grew,\n  And violets intermix'd a blue,\n  She finds the boy she went to find;\n  A thousand pleasures wait behind,\n  Aside a thousand arrows lie,\n  But all, unfeather'd, wait to fly.\n\n   When they met, the dame and boy,\n  Dancing graces, idle joy,                                   20\n  Wanton smiles, and airy play,\n  Conspired to make the scene be gay;\n  Love pair'd the birds through all the grove,\n  And Nature bid them sing to Love,\n  Sitting, hopping, fluttering sing,\n  And pay their tribute from the wing,\n  To fledge the shafts that idly lie,\n  And, yet unfeather'd, wait to fly.\n\n   'Tis thus, when Spring renews the blood,\n  They meet in every trembling wood,                          30\n  And thrice they make the plumes agree,\n  And every dart they mount with three,\n  And every dart can boast a kind,\n  Which suits each proper turn of mind.\n\n   From the towering eagle's plume\n  The generous hearts accept their doom;\n  Shot by the peacock's painted eye\n  The vain and airy lovers die:\n  For careful dames and frugal men,\n  The shafts are speckled by the hen:                         40\n  The pies and parrots deck the darts,\n  When prattling wins the panting hearts:\n  When from the voice the passions spring,\n  The warbling finch affords a wing:\n  Together, by the sparrow stung,\n  Down fall the wanton and the young:\n  And fledged by geese the weapons fly,\n  When others love they know not why.\n\n  All this (as late I chanced to rove)\n  I learn'd in yonder waving grove.                           50\n  And see, says Love, who call'd me near,\n  How much I deal with Nature here;\n  How both support a proper part,\n  She gives the feather, I the dart:\n  Then cease for souls averse to sigh,\n  If Nature cross ye, so do I;\n  My weapon there unfeather'd flies,\n  And shakes and shuffles through the skies.\n  But if the mutual charms I find\n  By which she links you, mind to mind,                       60\n  They wing my shafts, I poise the darts,\n  And strike from both, through both your hearts.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n  ANACREONTIC.\n\n  1 Gay Bacchus

 Edwin, I wis, a gentle youth,\n    Endow'd with courage, sense, and truth,\n        Though badly shaped he been.\n\n  2 His mountain back mote well be said\n    To measure heighth against his head,\n        And lift itself above:\n    Yet spite of all that Nature did\n    To make his uncouth form forbid,\n        This creature dared to love.\n\n  3 He felt the charms of Edith's eyes,\n    Nor wanted hope to gain the prize,\n        Could ladies look within;\n    But one Sir Topaz dress'd with art,\n    And, if a shape could win a heart,\n        He had a shape to win.\n\n  4 Edwin (if right I read my song)\n    With slighted passion paced along,\n        All in the moony light:\n    'Twas near an old enchanted court,\n    Where sportive Faeries made resort\n        To revel out the night.\n\n  5 His heart was drear, his hope was cross'd,\n    'Twas late, 'twas farr, the path was lost\n        That reach'd the neighbour-town;\n    With weary steps he quits the shades,\n    Resolved, the darkling dome he treads,\n        And drops his limbs adown.\n\n  6 But scant he lays him on the floor,\n    When hollow winds remove the door,\n        A trembling rocks the ground:\n    And (well I ween to count aright)\n    At once an hundred tapers light\n        On all the walls around.\n\n  7 Now sounding tongues assail his ear,\n    Now sounding feet approachen near,\n        And now the sounds increase:\n    And from the corner where he lay\n    He sees a train, profusely gay,\n        Come prankling o'er the place.\n\n  8 But trust me, gentles! never yet\n    Was dight a masquing half so neat,\n        Or half so rich before;\n    The country lent the sweet perfumes,\n    The sea the pearl, the sky the plumes,\n        The town its silken store.\n\n   9 Now whilst he gazed, a gallant dress'd\n     In flaunting robes above the rest,\n         With awful accent cried:\n     What mortal of a wretched mind,\n     Whose sighs infect the balmy wind,\n         Has here presumed to hide?\n\n  10 At this the swain, whose venturous soul\n     No fears of magic art control,\n         Advanced in open sight:\n     Nor have I cause of dread, he said,\n     Who view, by no presumption led,\n         Your revels of the night.\n\n  11 'Twas grief, for scorn of faithful love,\n     Which made my steps unweeting rove\n         Amid the nightly dew.\n     'Tis well, the gallant cries again,\n     We Faeries never injure men\n         Who dare to tell us true.\n\n  12 Exalt thy love-dejected heart,\n     Be mine the task, or e'er we part,\n         To make thee grief resign;\n     Now take the pleasure of thy chaunce;\n     Whilst I with Mab my partner daunce,\n         Be little Mable thine.\n\n  13 He spoke, and all a-sudden there\n     Light music floats in wanton air;\n         The monarch leads the queen:\n     The rest their Faerie partners found,\n     And Mable trimly tripp'd the ground\n         With Edwin of the green.\n\n  14 The dauncing past, the board was laid,\n     And siker such a feast was made\n         As heart and lip desire;\n     Withouten hands the dishes fly,\n     The glasses--with a wish come nigh,\n         And with a wish retire.\n\n  15 But now, to please the Faerie King,\n     Full every deal, they laugh and sing,\n         And antic feats devise;\n     Some wind and tumble like an ape,\n     And other some transmute their shape\n         In Edwin's wondering eyes.\n\n  16 Till one at last that Robin bight,\n     (Renown'd for pinching maids by night)\n         Has hent him up aloof;\n     And full against the beam he flung,\n     Where by the back the youth he hung\n         To spraul unneath the roof.\n\n  17 From thence, Reverse my charm, he cries,\n     And let it fairly now suffice\n         The gambol has been shown.\n     But Oberon answers with a smile,\n     Content thee, Edwin, for a while,\n         The vantage is thine own.\n\n  18 Here ended all the phantom-play;\n     They smelt the fresh approach of day,\n         And heard a cock to crow;\n     The whirling wind that bore the crowd\n     Has clapp'd the door, and whistled loud,\n         To warn them all to go.\n\n  19 Then screaming all at once they fly,\n     And all at once the tapers die,\n         Poor Edwin falls to floor;\n     Forlorn his state, and dark the place,\n     Was never wight in sike a case\n         Through all the land before.\n\n  20 But soon as Dan Apollo rose,\n     Full jolly creature home he goes,\n         He feels his back the less;\n     His honest tongue and steady mind\n     Had rid him of the lump behind\n         Which made him want success.\n\n  21 With lusty livelyhed he talks,\n     He seems a-dauncing as he walks,\n         His story soon took wind;\n     And beauteous Edith sees the youth,\n     Endow'd with courage, sense, and truth,\n         Without a bunch behind.\n\n  22 The story told, Sir Topaz moved,\n     The youth of Edith erst approved,\n         To see the revel scene:\n     At close of eve he leaves his home,\n     And wends to find the ruin'd dome\n         All on the gloomy plain.\n\n  23 As there he bides, it so befell,\n     The wind came rustling down a dell,\n         A shaking seized the wall:\n     Up spring the tapers as before,\n     The Faeries bragly foot the floor,\n         And music fills the hall.\n\n  24 But, certes, sorely sunk with woe\n     Sir Topaz sees the elfin show,\n         His spirits in him die:\n     When Oberon cries, A man is near,\n     A mortal passion, cleeped fear,\n         Hang's flagging in the sky.\n\n  25 With that Sir Topaz, hapless youth!\n     In accents faltering aye for ruth,\n         Entreats them pity graunt;\n     For als he been a mister wight\n     Betray'd by wandering in the night\n         To tread the circled haunt.\n\n  26 Ah, losel vile! (at once they roar)\n     And little skill'd of Faerie lore,\n         Thy cause to come we know:\n     Now has thy kestrel courage fell;\n     And Faeries, since a lie you tell,\n         Are free to work thee woe.\n\n  27 Then Will, who bears the wispy fire,\n     To trail the swains among the mire,\n         The caitiff upward flung;\n     There like a tortoise in a shop\n     He dangled from the chamber-top,\n         Where whilom Edwin hung.\n\n  28 The revel now proceeds apace,\n     Deftly they frisk it o'er the place,\n         They sit, they drink, and eat;\n     The time with frolic mirth beguile,\n     And poor Sir Topaz hangs the while,\n         Till all the rout retreat.\n\n  29 By this the stars began to wink,\n     They shriek, they fly, the tapers sink,\n         And down ydrops the knight.\n     For never spell by Faerie laid\n     With strong enchantment bound a glade\n         Beyond the length of night.\n\n  30 Chill, dark, alone, adreed he lay,\n     Till up the welkin rose the day,\n         Then deem'd the dole was o'er;\n     But wot ye well his harder lot?\n     His seely back the bunch has got\n         Which Edwin lost afore.\n\n  31 This tale a Sybil-nurse aread;\n     She softly stroked my youngling head,\n         And when the tale was done,\n     Thus some are born, my son, (she cries,)\n     With base impediments to rise,\n         And some are born with none.\n\n  32 But virtue can itself advaunce\n     To what the favourite fools of chaunce\n         By fortune seem'd design'd;\n     Virtue can gain the odds of Fate,\n     And from itself shake off the weight\n         Upon the unworthy mind.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n  TO MR POPE.\n\n  To praise, yet still with due respect to praise,\n  A bard triumphant in immortal bays,\n  The learn'd to show, the sensible commend,\n  Yet still preserve the province of the friend,\n  What life, what vigour, must the lines require,\n  What music tune them, what affection fire!\n\n   Oh!

while Pope and Virgil sing.\n\n   In English lays, and all sublimely great,\n  Thy Homer warms with all his ancient heat;\n  He shines in council, thunders in the fight,\n  And flames with every sense of great delight.                50\n  Long has that poet reign'd, and long unknown,\n  Like monarchs sparkling on a distant throne,\n  In all the majesty of Greek retired,\n  Himself unknown, his mighty name admired;\n  His language failing, wrapp'd him round with night,\n  Thine, raised by thee, recalls the work to light.\n  So wealthy mines, that ages long before\n  Fed the large realms around with golden ore,\n  When choked by sinking banks, no more appear,\n  And shepherds only say, The mines were here:                60\n  Should some rich youth (if Nature warm his heart,\n  And all his projects stand inform'd with Art)\n  Here clear the caves, there ope the leading vein;\n  The mines, detected, flame with gold again.\n\n   How vast, how copious are thy new designs!\n  How every music varies in thy lines!\n  Still as I read, I feel my bosom beat,\n  And rise in raptures by another's heat.\n  Thus in the wood, when summer dress'd the days,\n  When Windsor lent us tuneful hours of ease,                 70\n  Our ears the lark, the thrush, the turtle blest,\n  And Philomela sweetest o'er the rest:\n  The shades resound with song--oh softly tread!\n  While a whole season warbles round my head.\n\n   This to my friend--and when a friend inspires,\n  My silent harp its master's hand requires,\n  Shakes off the dust, and makes these rocks resound;\n  For fortune placed me in unfertile ground,\n  Far from the joys that with my soul agree,\n  From wit, from learning--far, oh far from thee!

the pilgrim-staff he bore,\n  And fix'd the scallop in his hat before;\n  Then with the sun a rising journey went,\n  Sedate to think, and watching each event.\n\n   The morn was wasted in the pathless grass,\n  And long and lonesome was the wild to pass;                 30\n  But when the southern sun had warm'd the day,\n  A youth came posting o'er a crossing way;\n  His raiment decent, his complexion fair,\n  And soft in graceful ringlets waved his hair.\n  Then near approaching, 'Father, hail!' he cried,\n  'And hail, my Son!' the reverend sire replied;\n  Words follow'd words, from question answer flow'd,\n  And talk of various kind deceived the road.\n  Till each with other pleased, and loth to part,\n  While in their age they differ, join in heart:              40\n  Thus stands an aged elm in ivy bound,\n  Thus youthful ivy clasps an elm around.\n\n   Now sunk the sun; the closing hour of day\n  Came onward, mantled o'er with sober gray;\n  Nature in silence bid the world repose;\n  When near the road a stately palace rose:\n  There by the moon through ranks of trees they pass,\n  Whose verdure crown'd their sloping sides of grass.\n  It chanced the noble master of the dome,\n  Still made his house the wandering stranger's home:         50\n  Yet still the kindness, from a thirst of praise,\n  Proved the vain flourish of expensive ease.\n  The pair arrive: the liveried servants wait;\n  Their lord receives them at the pompous gate;\n  The table groans with costly piles of food,\n  And all is more than hospitably good;\n  Then led to rest, the day's long toil they drown,\n  Deep sunk in sleep, and silk, and heaps of down.\n\n   At length 'tis morn, and at the dawn of day,\n  Along the wide canals the Zephyrs play;                     60\n  Fresh o'er the gay parterres the breezes creep,\n  And shake the neighbouring wood to banish sleep.\n  Up rise the guests, obedient to the call;\n  An early banquet deck'd the splendid hall;\n  Rich luscious wine a golden goblet graced,\n  Which the kind master forced the guests to taste.\n  Then pleased and thankful, from the porch they go,\n  And, but the landlord, none had cause of woe;\n  His cup was vanish'd--for in secret guise\n  The younger guest purloin'd the glittering prize.           70\n\n   As one who spies a serpent in his way,\n  Glistening and basking in the summer ray,\n  Disorder'd stops to shun the danger near,\n  Then walks with faintness on, and looks with fear:\n  So seem'd the sire, when, far upon the road,\n  The shining spoil his wily partner show'd.\n  He stopp'd with silence, walk'd with trembling heart,\n  And much he wish'd, but durst not ask to part:\n  Murmuring he lifts his eyes, and thinks it hard,\n  That generous actions meet a base reward.                   80\n\n   While thus they pass, the sun his glory shrouds,\n  The changing skies hang out their sable clouds;\n  A sound in air presaged approaching rain,\n  And beasts to cover scud across the plain.\n  Warn'd by the signs, the wandering pair retreat,\n  To seek for shelter at a neighbouring seat.\n  'Twas built with turrets, on a rising ground,\n  And strong, and large, and unimproved around;\n  Its owner's temper, timorous and severe,\n  Unkind and griping, caused a desert there.                  90\n\n   As near the miser's heavy doors they drew,\n  Fierce rising gusts with sudden fury blew;\n  The nimble lightning, mix'd with showers, began,\n  And o'er their heads loud-rolling thunder ran.\n  Here long they knock, but knock or call in vain,\n  Driven by the wind, and batter'd by the rain.\n  At length some pity warm'd the master's breast,\n  ('Twas then his threshold first received a guest)\n  Slow creaking turns the door with jealous care,\n  And half he welcomes in the shivering pair;                100\n  One frugal <DW19> lights the naked walls,\n  And Nature's fervour through their limbs recalls:\n  Bread of the coarsest sort, with eager[1] wine,\n  (Each hardly granted) served them both to dine;\n  And when the tempest first appear'd to cease,\n  A ready warning bid them part in peace.\n\n   With still remark the pondering hermit view'd,\n  In one so rich, a life so poor and rude;\n  And why should such, (within himself he cried,)\n  Lock the lost wealth a thousand want beside?               110\n  But what new marks of wonder soon took place,\n  In every settling feature of his face,\n  When from his vest the young companion bore\n  That cup, the generous landlord own'd before,\n  And paid profusely with the precious bowl\n  The stinted kindness of this churlish soul!\n\n   But now the clouds in airy tumult fly,\n  The sun emerging opes an azure sky;\n  A fresher green the smelling leaves display,\n  And glittering as they tremble, cheer the day:             120\n  The weather courts them from the poor retreat,\n  And the glad master bolts the wary gate.\n\n   While hence they walk, the pilgrim's bosom wrought\n  With all the travail of uncertain thought;\n  His partner's acts without their cause appear,\n  'Twas there a vice, and seem'd a madness here:\n  Detesting that, and pitying this, he goes,\n  Lost and confounded with the various shows.\n\n   Now night's dim shades again involve the sky;\n  Again the wanderers want a place to lie,                   130\n  Again they search, and find a lodging nigh.\n  The soil improved around, the mansion neat,\n  And neither poorly low, nor idly great:\n  It seem'd to speak its master's turn of mind,\n  Content, and not for praise, but virtue kind.\n\n   Hither the walkers turn with weary feet,\n  Then bliss the mansion, and the master greet:\n  Their greeting fair bestow'd, with modest guise,\n  The courteous master hears, and thus replies:\n\n   'Without a vain, without a grudging heart,                140\n  To Him who gives us all, I yield a part;\n  From Him you come, for Him accept it here,\n  A frank and sober, more than costly cheer.'\n\n   He spoke, and bid the welcome table spread,\n  Then talk'd of virtue till the time of bed,\n  When the grave household round his hall repair,\n  Warn'd by a bell, and close the hours with prayer.\n\n   At length the world, renew'd by calm repose,\n  Was strong for toil, the dappled morn arose;\n  Before the pilgrims part, the younger crept,               150\n  Near the closed cradle where an infant slept,\n  And writhed his neck: the landlord's little pride--\n  Oh, strange return!--grew black, and gasp'd, and died.\n  Horror of horrors! what! his only son!\n  How look'd our hermit when the fact was done?\n  Not hell, though hell's black jaws in sunder part,\n  And breathe blue fire, could more assault his heart.\n\n   Confused, and struck with silence at the deed,\n  He flies, but, trembling, fails to fly with speed.\n  His steps the youth pursues; the country lay               160\n  Perplex'd with roads, a servant show'd the way:\n  A river cross'd the path; the passage o'er\n  Was nice to find; the servant trode before;\n  Long arms of oaks an open bridge supplied,\n  And deep the waves beneath the bending glide.\n  The youth, who seem'd to watch a time to sin,\n  Approach'd the careless guide, and thrust him in;\n  Plunging he falls, and rising lifts his head,\n  Then flashing turns, and sinks among the dead.\n\n   Wild sparkling rage inflames the father's eyes,           170\n  He bursts the bands of fear, and madly cries:\n  'Detested wretch!'--But scarce his speech began,\n  When the strange partner seem'd no longer man:\n  His youthful face grew more serenely sweet;\n  His robe turn'd white, and flow'd upon his feet;\n  Fair rounds of radiant points invest his hair;\n  Celestial odours breathe through purpled air;\n  And wings, whose colours glitter'd on the day,\n  Wide at his back their gradual plumes display;\n  The form ethereal bursts upon his sight,                   180\n  And moves in all the majesty of light.\n\n   Though loud at first the pilgrim's passion grew,\n  Sudden he gazed, and wist not what to do;\n  Surprise in secret chains his word suspends,\n  And in a calm his settling temper ends.\n  But silence here the beauteous angel broke,\n  The voice of music ravish'd as he spoke:\n\n   'Thy prayer, thy praise, thy life to vice unknown,\n  In sweet memorial rise before the throne:\n  These charms, success in our bright region find,           190\n  And force an angel down, to calm thy mind;\n  For this commission'd, I forsook the sky--\n  Nay, cease to kneel--thy fellow-servant I!\n\n   'Then know the truth of government divine,\n  And let these scruples be no longer thine.\n\n   'The Maker justly claims that world He made,\n  In this the right of Providence is laid;\n  Its sacred majesty through all depends\n  On using second means to work His ends:\n  'Tis thus, withdrawn in state from human eye,              200\n  The power exerts His attributes on high,\n  Your actions uses, not controls your will,\n  And bids the doubting sons of men \"be still!\"\n\n   'What strange events can strike with more surprise,\n  Than those which lately struck thy wondering eyes?\n  Yet, taught by these, confess the Almighty just,\n  And where you can't unriddle, learn to trust!\n\n   'The great, vain man, who fared on costly food,\n  Whose life was too luxurious to be good;\n  Who made his ivory stands with goblets shine,              210\n  And forced his guests to morning draughts of wine,\n  Has, with the cup, the graceless custom lost,\n  And still he welcomes, but with less of cost.\n\n   'The mean, suspicious wretch, whose bolted door,\n  Ne'er moved in duty to the wandering poor;\n  With him I left the cup, to teach his mind\n  That Heaven can bless, if mortals will be kind.\n  Conscious of wanting worth, he views the bowl,\n  And feels compassion touch his grateful soul.\n  Thus artists melt the sullen ore of lead,                  220\n  With heaping coals of fire upon its head;\n  In the kind warmth the metal learns to glow,\n  And, loose from dross, the silver runs below.\n\n   'Long had our pious friend in virtue trod,\n  But now the child half-wean'd his heart from God;\n  Child of his age, for him he lived in pain,\n  And measured back his steps to earth again.\n  To what excesses had his dotage run?\n  But God, to save the father, took the son.\n  To all but thee, in fits he seem'd to go,                  230\n  And 'twas my ministry to deal the blow.\n  The poor fond parent, humbled in the dust,\n  Now owns in tears the punishment was just.\n\n   'But how had all his fortune felt a wrack,\n  Had that false servant sped in safety back?\n  This night his treasured heaps he meant to steal,\n  And what a fund of charity would fail!\n\n   'Thus Heaven instructs thy mind: this trial o'er,\n  Depart in peace, resign'd, and sin no more.'\n\n   On sounding pinions here the youth withdrew               240\n  The sage stood wondering as the seraph flew.\n  Thus look'd Elisha, when, to mount on high,\n  His master took the chariot of the sky;\n  The fiery pomp ascending left the view;\n  The prophet gazed, and wish'd to follow too.\n\n    The bending hermit here a prayer begun,\n  'Lord! as in heaven, on earth Thy will be done.'\n  Then gladly turning, sought his ancient place,\n  And pass'd a life of piety and peace.\n\n[Footnote 1: 'Eager:' i. e., sharp and sour.]\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEND OF PARNELL'S POEMS.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\nTHE LIFE AND POEMS\n\nOF\n\nTHOMAS GRAY.\n\nHow dearly, at one time, and how cheaply at another, does Genius\npurchase immortal fame! Here a Milton\n\n  \"Scorns delights, and lives laborious days,\"\n\nthat he may, through sufferings, sorrows, and the strainings of a long\nlife, pile up a large and lofty poem;--and there a Gray, in the\nintervals of other studies, produces a few short but exquisite verses,\nwhich become instantly and for ever popular, and render his name as\ndear to many, if not dearer, than that of the sublimer bard; for there\nare probably thousands who would prefer to have written the \"Elegy\nwritten in a Country Churchyard,\" instead of the \"Paradise Lost.\"\n\nThomas Gray was born in Cornhill, London, on the 26th December 1716.\nHis father was Mr Philip Gray, a respectable scrivener, and his\nmother's name was Dorothy Antrobus. Gray was the fifth of twelve\nchildren, and the only one that survived. His life was saved in\ninfancy by his mother, who, during a paroxysm which attacked her son,\nopened a vein with her own hand. This, and many other acts of maternal\ntenderness, rendered her memory unspeakably dear to the poet, who\nseldom mentioned her, after her death, \"without a sigh.\" He was sent\nto study at Eton College, the happy days spent in which he has so\nbeautifully commemorated in his \"Ode on a Distant Prospect of Eton\nCollege.\" It added to his comfort here that his maternal uncle, Mr\nAntrobus, was an assistant-teacher. From Eton he passed to Pembroke\nCollege, Cambridge, where he was admitted as a pensioner in 1734, in\nthe nineteenth year of his age. He had at Eton become intimate with\nHorace Walpole and with Richard West, a young man of high promise, who\ndied early. It is worth noticing that, during his residence both at\nEton and Cambridge, he was supported entirely out of the separate\nindustry of his mother, his father refusing him all aid.\n\nAt Cambridge, Gray studied very hard, attending less to mathematics\nthan to classical literature, modern languages, history, and poetry.\nHe aspired to be a universally accomplished as well as a minutely\nlearned man. His compositions, from 1734 to 1738, were translations\nfrom Italian into Latin and English, and one or two small pieces of\noriginal verse. In September 1738, he returned to his father's house,\nand remained there for six months, doing little except carrying on a\ncorrespondence he had begun at Cambridge with West and other friends.\nCorrespondence, from the first and to the last, was the best OUTCOME\nof Gray's mind--he felt himself most at home in it; and, next to\nCowper's, his letters are the most delightful in the English language.\n\nHe had intended to study law, but was diverted from his purpose by\nHorace Walpole, who invited him to take in his Company the \"grand\ntour.\" To no Briton, since Milton, could travel have been more\ncongenial or more instructive than to Gray. He that would travel to\nadvantage must first have travelled in mind all the countries he\nvisits, and must be learned in their literature, their politics, their\nscenery, and their antiquities, ere ever he sets a foot upon their\nshores. To Italy and France, Gray went as to favourite studies, not as\nto relaxations; and spent his time in observing their famous scenes\nwith the eye of a poet--cataloguing their paintings in the spirit of a\nconnoisseur--perfecting his knowledge of their languages--examining\nminutely the principles of their architecture and music--comparing\ntheir present aspect with the old classical descriptions; and writing\nhome an elegant epistolary account of all his sights, and all\nhis speculations. He saw Paris--visited Geneva--passed to\nFlorence--hurried to Rome on the tidings of Pope Clement XII's death,\nto see the installation of his successor--stood beside the cataracts\nof Tivoli and Terni, and might have seen in both, emblems of his own\ngenius, which, like them, was beautiful and powerful, but\nartificial--took a rapid run to Naples, and was charmed beyond\nexpression with its bay, its climate, and its fruitage--and was one of\nthe first English travellers to visit Herculaneum, discovered only the\nyear before (1739), and to wonder at that strange and solemn rehearsal\nof the resurrection exhibited in its streets. From Naples he returned\nto Florence, where he continued eleven months, and began a Latin poem,\n\"De Principiis Cogitandi.\" He then, on the 24th of April 1741, set off\nwith Walpole for Bologna and Reggio. At this latter place occurred the\ncelebrated quarrel between the two travellers. The causes and\ncircumstances of this are involved in considerable obscurity.\nDissimilarity of tastes and habits was probably at the bottom of it.\nGray was an enthusiastic scholar; Walpole was then a gay and giddy\nvoluptuary, although predestined to sour down into the most\ncold-blooded and cynical of gossips. They parted at Reggio, to meet\nonly once afterwards at Strawberry Hill, where Gray long after visited\nWalpole at his own invitation, but told him frankly he never could be\non the same terms of friendship again. Left now to pursue his journey\nalone, he went to Venice, and thence came back through Padua and Milan\nto France. On his way between Turin and Lyons, he turned aside to see\nagain the noble mountainous scenery surrounding the Grande Chartreuse\nin Dauphine; and in the album kept by the fathers wrote his Alcaic\nOde, testifying to his admiration of a scene where, he says, \"every\nprecipice and cliff was pregnant, with religion and poetry.\"\n\nTwo months after his return to England, his father died, somewhat\nimpoverished by improvidence. Gray, thinking himself too poor to study\nthe law, sent his mother and a maiden sister to reside at Stoke, near\nWindsor, and retired to Peterhouse, Cambridge, where he resumed his\nclassical and poetical pursuits. To West, who by this time was\ndeclining in health, he sent part of \"Agrippina,\" a tragedy he had\ncommenced. West objected to the length and prosiness of Agrippina's\nspeeches. These were afterwards altered by Mason, in accordance with\nWest's suggestions; but Gray was discouraged, and has left \"Agrippina\"\na Torso. The subject was unpleasing. To have treated adequately the\ncharacter of Nero, would have required more than the genius of Gray;\nand the language of the fragment is distinguished rather by rhetorical\nburnish than by poetical spirit and heat. We have not thought it\nnecessary to reprint it, nor several besides of the fragmentary and\ninferior productions of this poet, which Mason, too, thought proper\nto omit.\n\nGray now plunged into the _mare magnum_ of classical literature. With\ngreater energy and exclusiveness than before, he read Thucydides,\nTheocritus, and Anacreon; he translated parts of Propertius, and he\nwrote a heroic epistle in Latin, after the manner of Ovid, and a Greek\nepigram. This last he communicated to West, who was now in\nHertfordshire, waiting the approach of the Angel of Death. To the same\ndear friend he sent his \"Ode to Spring,\" which he had written under\nhis mother's roof at Stoke. He was too late. West was dead before it\narrived. This amiable and gifted person, who was thought by many\nsuperior in natural genius to his friend, and whose name is for ever\nconnected with that of Gray, expired on the 1st of June 1742, and now\nreposes in the chancel of Hatfield Church. We strongly suspect that it\nwas he whom Gray had in his eye in the close of his \"Elegy.\"\n\nAutumn has often been thought propitious to genius, especially when\nits tender sun-light is still further sweetened and saddened by the\njoy of grief. In the autumn of this year, Gray, who was peculiarly\nsusceptible to skiey influences, wrote some of his best poetry--his\n\"Hymn to Adversity,\" his \"Distant Prospect of Eton College,\" and\ncommenced his \"Elegy written in a Country Churchyard.\" A Sonnet in\nEnglish, and the Apostrophe which opens the fourth book of his \"De\nPrincipiis Cogitandi,\" bore testimony to his esteem for the character\nand his regret for the premature loss of Richard West.\n\nTo Cambridge Gray seems to have had little attachment; but partly from\nthe smallness of his income, and partly from the access he had to its\nlibraries, he was found there to the last, constantly complaining, and\nalways continuing, like the _statue_ of a murmurer. In the winter of\n1742 he was admitted Bachelor of Civil Law; and in acknowledgment of\nthe honour of the admission, began an \"Address to Ignorance,\" which it\nis no great loss to his fame that he never finished. Hazlitt completed\nwhat appears to have been Gray's design in that admirable and\nsearching paper of his, entitled, \"The Ignorance of the Learned,\" in\nwhich he shows how ill mere learning supplies the want of common sense\nand practical knowledge, as well as of talent and genius.\n\nIn 1744, through the intervention of a lady, the difference between\nWalpole and Gray was so far made up, that they resumed their\ncorrespondence, although never their intimacy. About this time he got\nacquainted with Mason, then a scholar in St John's College, who became\na minor Boswell to a minor Johnson; although he used liberties with\nGray's correspondence and poetry, such as Boswell never durst have\nattempted with his idol. Mason had first introduced himself to Gray by\nshowing him some MS. poetry. With the famous Dr Conyers Middleton,\ntoo, he became intimate, and lived to lament his death.\n\nIn 1747, Dodsley published for him his \"Ode to Eton College,\" the\nfirst of Gray's productions which appeared in print. It excited no\nnotice whatever. Walpole wished him to publish his poems in\nconjunction with the remains of West; but this he declined, on account\nof want of materials--perhaps also feeling the great superiority of\nhis own poetry. At Walpole's request, however, he wrote an ode on the\ndeath of his favourite cat!\n\nGreek became now his constant study. He read its more recondite\nauthors, such as Pausanias, Athenaeus, Pindar, Lysias, and AEschylus,\nwith great care, and commenced the preparation of a Table of Greek\nChronology, on a very minute and elaborate scale.\n\nIn 1749 he lost his aunt, Mrs Antrobus, and her death, which he felt\nas a heavy affliction, led him to complete his \"Elegy,\" which he sent\nto Walpole, who handed it about in MS., to the great delight of those\nwho were privileged to peruse it. When published, it sold rapidly, and\ncontinues still the most popular of his poems.\n\nIn March 1753, his beloved and revered mother died, and he erected\nover her dust a monument, with an inscription testifying to the\nstrength of his filial love and sorrow. In 1755 he finished his \"Ode\non the Progress of Poetry,\" and in the same year began his \"Bard.\" All\nhis poems, however short, were most laboriously composed, written and\nrewritten, subjected, in whole or in part, to the criticism of his\nfriends, and, according to their verdict, either published, or left\nfragments, or consigned to the flames. About this time he begins, in\nhis letters, to complain of depression of spirits, of severe attacks\nof the gout, of sleepless nights, feverish mornings, and heavy days.\nHe was now, and during the rest of his life, to pay the penalty of a\nlettered indolence and studious sloth, of a neglected body and an\nover-cultivated mind. The accident, it is said, of seeing a blind\nWelsh harper performing on a harp, excited him to finish his \"Bard,\"\nwhich in MS. appears to have divided the opinion of his friends, as it\nstill does that of the critics.\n\nIn 1758 Gray left Peterhouse, owing to some real or imaginary offence,\nand removed to Pembroke Hall, where he was surrounded by his old and\nintimate friends. The next year he carried his two Odes to London, as\ncarefully as if they had been two Epics. Walpole says that he\n\"snatched them out of Dodsley's hands, and made them 'the first-fruits\nof his own press at Strawberry Hill,' where a thousand copies were\nprinted. When published, they attracted much attention, but did not\ngain universal applause. Obscurity was the principal charge brought\nagainst them. Their friends, however, including Warburton, Hurd,\nMason, and Garrick, were vehement in their admiration, and loud in\ntheir encomiums. In this year Colley Cibber, the laureate, died, and\nthe office was offered to Gray, with the peculiar and highly\nhonourable condition, that he was to hold it as a sinecure. The poet,\nhowever, refused, on the ground, as he tells Mason, that the office\nhad 'hitherto humbled its possessor.'\"\n\nIn 1758, he composed, for his amusement, a \"Catalogue of the\nAntiquities, Houses, &c., in England and Wales,\" which was, after his\ndeath, printed and distributed by Mason among his friends.\n\nThe next year the British Museum was opened (15th January 1759), and\nGray went to London to read and transcribe the MSS. collected there\nfrom the Harleian and Cottoman libraries. During his residence in the\ncapital, appeared two odes to \"Obscurity\" and \"Oblivion,\" in ridicule\nof his lyrics, from the pens of Colman and Lloyd, full of spirited\nsatire, which failed, however, to disturb the poet's equanimity. Like\nmany fastidious writers, he was more afraid of his own taste, and of\nthe strictures of good-natured friends, than of the attacks of foes.\nIn 1762 he applied for the Professorship of Modern History, vacant by\nthe death of Turner; but it was given to Brochet, the tutor of Sir\nJames Lowther.\n\nIn 1765 he took a tour to Scotland, and saw many of its more\ninteresting points--Stirling, Loch Tay, the Pass of Killierankie, and\nGlammis Castle, where he met Beattie. He wrote a very entertaining\naccount of the journey, in his letters to his friends. He was offered\nan LL.D. by the College of Aberdeen; but out of respect to his own\nUniversity, declined the honour. In 1767 he added his \"Imitations of\nWelsh and Norwegian Poetry\" to his other productions. Sir Walter Scott\ntells us, that when Gray's poems reached the Orkney and Shetland\nIsles, and when the \"Fatal Sisters\" was repeated by a clergyman to\nsome of the old inhabitants, they remembered having sung it all in its\nnative language to him years before. In 1768, the Professorship of\nModern History falling again vacant by Mr Brochet's death, the Duke of\nGrafton instantly bestowed it on Gray, who, out of gratitude, wrote an\node on the installation of his patron to the Chancellorship of\nCambridge University. He went from witnessing this ceremony to the\nLakes of Cumberland, and kept an interesting journal of his tour to\nthat then little known and most enchanting region. In 1770, he visited\nWales; but owing probably to poor health, has left no notes of his\njourney. In May the next year, his health became worse, his spirits\nmore depressed, an incurable cough preyed on his lungs; he resigned\nhis Professorship, and shortly after removed to London. There he\nrallied a little, and returned to Cambridge, where, on the 24th of\nJuly, he was seized with a severe attack of gout in the stomach. Of\nthis he expired on the 30th, in the 55th year of his age, without any\napparent fear of death. He was buried by the side of his mother, in\nthe churchyard of Stoke. A monument was erected by Mason to his\nmemory, in Westminster Abbey.\n\nGray was a brilliant bookworm. In private he was a quiet, abstracted,\ndreaming scholar, although in the company of a few friends he could\nbecome convivial and witty. His heart, however, was always in his\nstudy. His portrait gives you the impression of great fastidiousness,\nand almost feminine delicacy of face, as well as of considerable\nself-esteem. His face has more of the critic than of the poet. His\nlearning and accomplishments have been equalled perhaps by no poet\nsince Milton. He knew the Classics, the Northern Scalds, the Italian\npoets and historians, the French novelists, Architecture, Zoology,\nPainting, Sculpture, Botany, Music, and Antiquities. But he liked\nbetter, he said, to read than to write. You figure him always lounging\nwith a volume in his hand, on a sofa, and crying out, \"Be mine to read\neternal novels of Marivaux and Crebillon.\" Against his moral character\nthere exists no imputation; and notwithstanding a sneering hint of\nWalpole's, his religious creed seems to have been orthodox.\n\nWith all his learning and genius, he has done little. His letters and\npoems remind you of a few scattered leaves, surviving the\nconflagration of the Alexandrian library. The very popularity of the\nscraps which such a writer leaves, secures the torments of Tantalus to\nhis numerous admirers in all after ages. His letters, in their grace,\nfreedom, minuteness of detail, occasional playfulness, delicious\n_asides_ of gossip, and easy vigour of description, are more worthy of\nhis powers, as a whole, than his poetry. The poetic fragments he has\nleft are rarely of such merit as to excite any wish that they had been\nfinished. His genius, although true and exquisite, was limited in its\nrange, and hidebound in its movements. You see his genius, like a\nchild, always casting a look of terror round on its older companion\nand guardian--his taste. Like Campbell, \"he often spreads his wings\ngrandly, but shrinks back timidly to his perch again, and seems afraid\nof the shadow of his own fame.\" Within his own range, however, he is\nas strong as he is delicate and refined. His two principal Odes have,\nas we hinted, divided much the opinion of critics. Dr Johnson has\nassailed them in his worst style of captious and word-catching\ncriticism. Now, that there is much smoke around their fire, we grant.\nBut we argue that there is genuine fire amidst their smoke,--first,\nfrom the fact that so many of their lines, such as,\n\n  \"The bloom of young Desire, and purple light of Love;\"\n  \"The terror of his beak, and lightnings of his eye;\"\n  \"Their feather-cinctured chiefs, and dusky loves;\"\n  \"Sailing with supreme dominion\n  Through the azure deep of air;\"\n  \"Beneath the good how far, but far above the great\"\n  \"High-born Hoel's harp, and soft Llewellyn's lay,\"\n\nare so often and admiringly quoted; and because, secondly, we can\ntrace the influence of the \"Progress of Poetry,\" and of the \"Bard,\" on\nmuch of the higher song that has succeeded,--on the poetry of Bowles,\nColeridge, Wordsworth, Campbell, and Shelley. Gray was not a sun\nshining in his strength, but he was the morning star, prognosticating\nthe coming of a warmer and brighter poetic day.\n\nHe that can see no merit in the \"Ode on the Distant Prospect of Eton\nCollege,\" can surely never have been a boy. The boy's heart beats in\nits every line, and yet all the experiences of boyhood are seen and\nshown in the sober light of those\n\n  \"Years which bring the philosophic mind.\"\n\nHere lies the complex charm of the poem. The unthinking gaiety of\nboyhood, its light sports, its airy gladness, its springy motions, the\n\"tears forgot as soon as shed,\" the \"sunshine of the breast\" of that\ndelightful period--are contrasted with the still and often sombre\nreflection, the grave joys, the carking cares, the stern concentred\npassions, the serious pastimes, the spare but sullen and burning\ntears, the sad smiles of manhood; and contrasted by one who is\nrealising both with equal vividness and intensity--because he is in\nage a man, and in memory and imagination an Eton schoolboy still. The\nbreezes of boyhood return and blow on a head on which gray hairs are\nbeginning \"here and there\" to whiten; and he cries--\n\n  \"I feel the gales that from ye blow\n  A momentary bliss bestow,\n    As, waving fresh their gladsome wing,\n  My weary soul they seem to soothe,\n  And redolent of joy and youth,\n    To breathe a second spring.\"\n\nDr Johnson makes a peculiarly poor and unworthy objection to the next\nstanza of the poem. Speaking of the address to the Thames--\n\n  \"Say, Father Thames, for thou hast seen\n    Full many a sprightly race;\"\n\nhe says, \"Father Thames has no better means of knowing than himself.\"\nHe should have left this objection to those wretched _mechanical_\ncritics who abound in the present day. He forgot that in his own\n\"Rasselas\" he had invoked the Nile, as the great \"Father of waters,\"\nto tell, if, in any of the provinces through which he rolled, he did\nnot hear the language of distress. Critics, like liars, should have\ngood memories.\n\nHis remark that the \"Prospect of Eton College\" suggests nothing to\nGray which every beholder does not equally think and feel, is, in\nreality, a compliment to the simplicity and naturalness of the strain.\nCommon thought and feeling crystalised, is the staple of much of our\nbest poetry. Gray says in a poetical way, what every one might have\nthought and felt, but no one but he could have so beautifully\nexpressed. To the spirited translations from the Norse and Welsh, the\nonly objection urged by Dr Johnson is, that their \"language is unlike\nthe language of other poets\"--an objection which would tell still more\npowerfully against Milton, Collins, and Young, not to speak of the\n\"chartered libertines\" of our more modern song. But a running growl of\nprejudice is heard in every sentence of Gray's Life by Johnson, and\ntends far more to injure the critic than the poet.\n\nIn his \"Elegy written in a Country Churchyard,\" Gray has caught,\nconcentred, and turned into a fine essence, the substance of a\nthousand meditations among the tombs. One of its highest points of\nmerit, conceded by Dr Johnson, is essentially the same with which he\nhad found fault in the \"Ode to Eton College.\" \"The poem abounds with\nimages which find a mirror in every mind, and with sentiments to which\nevery bosom returns an echo.\" Everything is in intense keeping. The\nimages are few, but striking; the language is severely simple; the\nthought is at once obvious and original, at once clear and profound,\nand many of the couplets seem carefully and consciously chiselled for\nimmortality, to become mottoes for every churchyard in the kingdom,\nand to \"teach the rustic moralist to die,\" while the country remains\nbeautiful, and while death continues to inspire fear. And with what\ndaring felicity of genius does the author introduce, ere the close, a\nliving but anonymous figure amidst the company of the silent dead, and\ncontrive to unite the interest of a personal story, the charm of a\nmystery, and the solemnity of a moral meditation, into one fine whole!\nWe know of but one objection of much weight to this exquisite elegy.\nThere is scarcely the faintest or most faltering allusion to the\ndoctrine of the resurrection. Death has it all his own way in this\ncitadel of his power. The poet never points his finger to the distant\nhorizon, where life and immortality are beginning to colour the clouds\nwith the promise of the eternal morning. The elegy might almost have\nbeen written by a Pagan. In this point, Beattie, in his \"Hermit,\" has\nmuch the advantage of his friend Gray; for _his_ eye is anointed to\nbehold a blessed vision, and his voice is strengthened thus to sing--\n\n  \"On the pale cheek of Death smiles and roses are blending,\n  And Beauty immortal awakes from the tomb.\"\n\nNevertheless, had Gray been known, not for his scholarship, not for\nhis taste, not for his letters and minor poems, not for his reputed\npowers and unrivalled accomplishments, but solely for this elegy--had\nonly it and his mere name survived, it alone would have entitled him\nto rank with Britain's best poets.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\nGRAY'S POEMS.\n\n  ODES.\n\n  I.--ON THE SPRING.\n\n  1.

In the introduction to it he\nmeant to have produced some specimens of the style that reigned in\nancient times among the neighbouring nations, or those who had subdued\nthe greater part of this island, and were our progenitors: the\nfollowing three imitations made a part of them. He afterwards dropped\nhis design; especially after he had heard that it was already in the\nhands of a person[2] well qualified to do it justice both by his taste\nand his researches into antiquity.\n\nPREFACE.--In the eleventh century, Sigurd, Earl of the Orkney Islands,\nwent with a fleet of ships, and a considerable body of troops, into\nIreland, to the assistance of Sigtryg with the Silken Beard, who was\nthen making war on his father-in-law, Brian, King of Dublin. The Earl\nand all his forces were cut to pieces, and Sigtryg was in danger of a\ntotal defeat; but the enemy had a greater loss by the death of Brian,\ntheir king, who fell in the action. On Christmas-day (the day of the\nbattle) a native of Caithness, in Scotland, saw, at a distance, a\nnumber of persons on horseback riding full speed towards a hill, and\nseeming to enter into it. Curiosity led him to follow them, till,\nlooking through an opening in the rocks, he saw twelve gigantic\nfigures,[3] resembling women: they were all employed about a loom; and\nas they wove they sung the following dreadful song, which, when they\nhad finished, they tore the web into twelve pieces, and each taking\nher portion, galloped six to the north, and as many to the south.\n\n  1 Now the storm begins to lower,\n      (Haste, the loom of Hell prepare!)\n    Iron-sleet of arrowy shower\n      Hurtles in the darken'd air.\n\n  2 Glittering lances are the loom\n      Where the dusky warp we strain,\n    Weaving many a soldier's doom,\n      Orkney's woe and Randver's bane.\n\n  3 See the grisly texture grow,\n      ('Tis of human entrails made,)\n    And the weights that play below,\n      Each a gasping warrior's head.\n\n  4 Shafts for shuttles, dipp'd in gore,\n      Shoot the trembling cords along:\n    Sword, that once a monarch bore,\n      Keep the tissue close and strong.\n\n  5 Mista, black, terrific maid!\n      Sangrida and Hilda see,\n    Join the wayward work to aid:\n      'Tis the woof of victory.\n\n  6 Ere the ruddy sun be set,\n      Pikes must shiver, javelins sing,\n    Blade with clattering buckler meet,\n      Hauberk crash, and helmet ring.\n\n  7 (Weave the crimson web of war)\n      Let us go, and let us fly,\n    Where our friends the conflict share,\n      Where they triumph, where they die.\n\n  8 As the paths of Fate we tread,\n      Wading through th' ensanguined field,\n    Gondula and Geira spread\n      O'er the youthful king your shield.\n\n  9 We the reins to Slaughter give,\n      Ours to kill and ours to spare:\n    Spite of danger he shall live;\n      (Weave the crimson web of war.)\n\n  10 They whom once the desert beach\n       Pent within its bleak domain,\n     Soon their ample sway shall stretch\n       O'er the plenty of the plain.\n\n  11 Low the dauntless earl is laid,\n       Gored with many a gaping wound:\n     Fate demands a nobler head;\n       Soon a king shall bite the ground.\n\n  12 Long his loss shall Eirin[4] weep,\n       Ne'er again his likeness see;\n     Long her strains in sorrow steep,\n       Strains of immortality!\n\n  13 Horror covers all the heath,\n       Clouds of carnage blot the sun:\n     Sisters! weave the web of death:\n       Sisters! cease; the work is done.\n\n  14 Hail the task and hail the hands!\n       Songs of joy and triumph sing!\n     Joy to the victorious bands,\n       Triumph to the younger king!\n\n  15 Mortal! thou that hear'st the tale,\n       Learn the tenor of our song;\n     Scotland! through each winding vale\n       Far and wide the notes prolong.\n\n  16 Sisters! hence with spurs of speed;\n       Each her thundering falchion wield;\n     Each bestride her sable steed:\n     Hurry, hurry, to the field.\n\n\n[Footnote 1: 'Norse tongue:' to be found in the Orcades of Thormodus\nTorfaeus, Hafniae, 1697, folio; and also in Bartholinus.]\n\n[Footnote 2: 'Person:' Percy, author of 'Reliques of Ancient English\nPoetry.']\n\n[Footnote 3: 'Figures:' the Valkyriur were female divinities, servants\nof Odin (or Woden) in the Gothic mythology.

The performance\ninducing her to wish for the author's acquaintance, Lady Schaub and\nMiss Speed, then at her house, undertook to introduce her to it. These\ntwo ladies waited upon the author at his aunt's solitary habitation,\nwhere he at that time resided, and not finding him at home, they left\na card behind them. Mr Gray, surprised at such a compliment, returned\nthe visit; and as the beginning of this intercourse bore some\nappearance of romance, he gave the humorous and lively account of it\nwhich the 'Long Story' contains.\n\n  1 In Britain's isle, no matter where,\n      An ancient pile of building[1] stands:\n    The Huntingdons and Hattons there\n      Employ'd the power of fairy hands,\n\n  2 To raise the ceiling's fretted height,\n      Each pannel in achievements clothing,\n    Rich windows that exclude the light,\n      And passages that lead to nothing.\n\n  3 Full oft within the spacious walls,\n      When he had fifty winters o'er him,\n    My grave Lord-Keeper[2] led the brawls:\n      The seal and maces danced before him.\n\n  4 His bushy beard and shoe-strings green,\n      His high-crown'd hat and satin doublet,\n    Moved the stout heart of England's Queen,\n      Though Pope and Spaniard could not trouble it.\n\n  5 What, in the very first beginning,\n      Shame of the versifying tribe!\n    Your history whither are you spinning?\n      Can you do nothing but describe?\n\n  6 A house there is (and that's enough)\n      From whence one fatal morning issues\n    A brace of warriors, not in buff,\n      But rustling in their silks and tissues.\n\n  7 The first came _cap-a-pie_ from France,\n      Her conquering destiny fulfilling,\n    Whom meaner beauties eye askance,\n      And vainly ape her art of killing.\n\n  8 The other Amazon kind Heaven\n      Had arm'd with spirit, wit, and satire;\n    But Cobham had the polish given,\n      And tipp'd her arrows with good nature.\n\n  9 To celebrate her eyes, her air--\n      Coarse panegyrics would but tease her;\n    Melissa is her _nom de guerre;_\n      Alas!

they flew,\n       But left a spell upon the table.\n\n  21 The words too eager to unriddle,\n       The Poet felt a strange disorder;\n     Transparent birdlime form'd the middle,\n       And chains invisible the border.\n\n  22 So cunning was the apparatus,\n       The powerful pothooks did so move him,\n     That will-he, nill-he, to the great house\n       He went as if the devil drove him.\n\n  23 Yet on his way (no sign of grace,\n       For folks in fear are apt to pray)\n     To Phoebus he preferr'd his case,\n       And begg'd his aid that dreadful day.\n\n  24 The godhead would have back'd his quarrel:\n       But with a blush, on recollection,\n     Own'd that his quiver and his laurel\n       'Gainst four such eyes were no protection.\n\n  25 The court was set, the culprit there;\n       Forth from their gloomy mansions creeping,\n     The Lady Janes and Joans repair,\n       And from the gallery stand peeping:\n\n  26 Such as in silence of the night\n       Come sweep along some winding entry,\n     (Styack[3] has often seen the sight)\n       Or at the chapel-door stand sentry;\n\n  27 In peaked hoods and mantles tarnish'd,\n       Sour visages enough to scare ye,\n     High dames of honour once that garnish'd\n       The drawing-room of fierce Queen Mary!\n\n  28 The peeress comes: the audience stare,\n       And doff their hats with due submission;\n     She curtsies, as she takes her chair,\n       To all the people of condition.\n\n  29 The Bard with many an artless fib\n       Had in imagination fenced him,\n     Disproved the arguments of Squib,[4]\n       And all that Grooms[5] could urge against him.\n\n  30 But soon his rhetoric forsook him,\n       When he the solemn hall had seen;\n     A sudden fit of ague shook him;\n       He stood as mute as poor Maclean.[6]\n\n  31 Yet something he was heard to mutter,\n       How in the park, beneath an old tree,\n     (Without design to hurt the butter,\n       Or any malice to the poultry,)\n\n  32 He once or twice had penn'd a sonnet,\n       Yet hoped that he might save his bacon;\n     Numbers would give their oaths upon it,\n       He ne'er was for a conjuror taken.\n\n  33 The ghostly prudes, with hagged[7] face,\n       Already had condemn'd the sinner:\n     My Lady rose, and with a grace--\n       She smiled, and bid him come to dinner,\n\n  34 'Jesu-Maria!

With not a few, while other, and severer\nbranches of study are the laborious task of the day, poetry is the\nslipshod amusement of the evening. Dr Parr calls Johnson _probabilis\npoeta_--words which seem to convey the notion that the author of \"The\nRambler,\" who was great on other fields, was in that of poetry only\nrespectable. This term is more applicable to Smollett, whose poems\ndiscover only in part those keen, vigorous, and original powers which\nenabled him to indite \"Roderick Random\" and \"Humphrey Clinker.\" Yet\nthe author of \"Independence,\" and \"The Tears of Scotland,\" must not be\nexcluded from the list of British poets--an honour to which much even\nof his prose has richly entitled him.\n\nThe incidents in Smollett's history are not very numerous, and some of\nthem are narrated, under faint disguises, with inimitable vivacity and\n_vraisemblance_ in his own fictions. Tobias George Smollett was born\nin Dalquhurn House, near the village of Renton, Dumbartonshire, in\n1721. His father, a younger son of Sir James Smollett of Bonhill,\nhaving died early, the education of the poet devolved on his\ngrandfather. The scenery of his native place was well calculated to\ninspire his early genius. It is one of the most beautiful regions in\nScotland. A fine hollow vale, pervaded by the river Leven, and\nsurrounded by rich woodlands and bold hills, stretches up from\nDumbarton, with its double peaks and ancient castle, to the\nmagnificent Loch Lomond; and in one of the loops of this winding vale\nwas the great novelist born and bred. He called his native region, in\n\"Humphrey Clinker,\" the \"Arcadia of Scotland,\" and has sung the Leven\nin one of his small poems. He was sent to the Grammar School of\nDumbarton, and thence to Glasgow College. He was subsequently placed\napprentice to one M. Gordon, a medical practitioner in Glasgow; and\nfrom thence, according to some of his biographers, he proceeded to\nstudy medicine in Edinburgh. When he was about nineteen years of age,\nhis grandfather expired, without having made any provision for him;\nand he was compelled, in 1739, to repair to London, carrying with him\na tragedy entitled \"The Regicide,\"--the subject being the\nassassination of James the First of Scotland,--which he had written\nthe year before, and which he in vain sought to get presented at the\ntheatres. He had letters of introduction to some eminent literary\ncharacters, who, however, either could not or would not do anything\nfor him; and he found no better situation than that of surgeon's mate\nin an eighty-gun ship. He continued in the navy for six or seven\nyears, and was present at the disastrous siege of Carthagena, in 1741,\nwhich he has described in a Compendium of Voyages he compiled in 1756,\nand with still more vigour in \"Roderick Random.\" His long acquaintance\nwith the sea furnished ample materials for his genius, although it did\nnot improve his opinion of human nature. Disgusted with the service,\nhe quitted it in the West Indies, and lived for some time in Jamaica.\nHere he became acquainted with Miss Lascelles, a beautiful lady whom\nhe afterwards married. She sat for the portrait of Narcissa, in\n\"Roderick Random.\"\n\nIn 1746 he returned to England. He found the country ringing with\nindignation at the cruelties inflicted by Cumberland on the Highland\nrebels, and he caught and crystalised the prevalent emotion in his\nspirited lyric, \"The Tears of Scotland.\" He published the same year\nhis \"Advice,\"--a satirical poem upon things in general, and the public\nmen of the day in particular. He wrote also an opera entitled\n\"Alceste\" for Covent Garden; but owing to a dispute with the manager,\nit was neither acted nor printed. In 1747 he produced \"Reproof,\" the\nsecond part of \"Advice,\"--a poem which breathes the same manly\nindignation at the abuses, evils, and public charlatans of the day.\nThis year also he married Miss Lascelles, by whom he expected a\nfortune of three thousand pounds. This sum, however, was never fully\nrealised; and his generous housekeeping, and the expenses of a\nlitigation to which he was compelled, in connection with Miss\nLascelles' money, embarrassed his circumstances, and, much to the\nadvantage of the world, drove him to literature. In 1748, he gave to\nthe world his novel of \"Roderick Random,\"--counted by many the\nmasterpiece of his genius. It brought him in both fame and emolument.\nIn 1749 he published, by subscription, his unfortunate tragedy, \"The\nRegicide.\" In 1750 he went to Paris, and shortly after wrote his\n\"Adventures of Peregrine Pickle,\" including the memoirs of the\nnotorious Lady Vane--the substance of which he got from herself, and\nwhich added greatly to the popularity of the work. Notwithstanding the\nsuccess he met with as a novelist, he was anxious to prosecute his\noriginal profession of medicine; and having procured from a foreign\nuniversity the degree of M.D., he commenced to practise physic in\nChelsea, but without success. He wrote, however, an essay \"On the\nExternal Use of Water,\" in which he seems to have partly anticipated\nthe method of the cold-water cure. In 1753 he published his\n\"Adventures of Count Fathom;\" and, two years later, encouraged by a\nliberal subscription, he issued a translation of \"Don Quixote,\" in two\nquarto volumes. While this work was printing, he went down to\nScotland, visited his old scenes and old companions, and was received\neverywhere with enthusiasm. The most striking incident, however, in\nthis journey was his interview with his mother, then residing in\nScotston, near Peebles. He was introduced to her as a stranger\ngentleman from the West Indies; and, in order to retain his incognita,\nhe endeavoured to maintain a serious and frowning countenance. While\nhis mother, however, continued to regard him steadfastly, he could not\nforbear smiling; and she instantly sprang from her seat, threw her\narms round his neck, and cried out, \"Ah, my son, I have found you at\nlast! Your old roguish smile has betrayed you.\"\n\nReturning to England, he resumed his literary avocations. He became\nthe editor of the _Critical Review_--an office, of all others, least\nfitted to his testy and irritable temperament. This was in 1756. He\nnext published the \"Compendium of Voyages,\" in seven volumes, 12mo. In\n1757 he wrote a popular afterpiece, entitled \"The Reprisals; or, the\nTars of England;\" and in 1758 appeared his \"Complete History of\nEngland,\" in four volumes, quarto,--a work said to have been compiled\nin the almost incredibly short time of fourteen months. It became\ninstantly popular, although distinguished by no real historical\nquality, except a clear and lively style.\n\nAn attack on Admiral Knowles in the _Critical Review_ greatly incensed\nthe Admiral; and when he prosecuted the journal, Smollett stepped\nforward and avowed himself the author. He was sentenced to a fine of\nL100, and to three months' imprisonment. During his confinement in\nKing's Bench, he composed the \"Adventures of Sir Lancelot Greaves,\"\nwhich appeared first in detached numbers of the _British Magazine_,\nand was afterwards published separately in 1762. About this time, his\nbusy pen was also occupied with histories of France, Italy, Germany,\n&c., and a continuation of his English History--all compilations--and\nsome of them exceedingly unworthy of his genius. He became an ardent\nfriend and supporter of Lord Bute, and started _The Briton_, a weekly\npaper, in his defence; which gave rise to the _North Briton_, by\nWilkes. In our Life of Churchill, we have recounted his quarrel with\nthat poet, and the chastisement inflicted on Smollett in \"The Apology\nto the Critical Reviewers.\"\n\nIn 1763 he lost his only daughter, a girl of fifteen. This event threw\nhim into deep despondency, and seriously affected his health. He went\nto France and Italy for two years; and on his return, in 1766,\npublished two volumes of Travels--full of querulous and captious\nremarks--for which Sterne satirised him, under the name of Smelfungus.\nThe same year he again visited Scotland. In 1767 he published his\n\"Adventures of an Atom,\"--a political romance, displaying, under\nJapanese names, the different parties of Great Britain. A recurrence\nof ill health drove him back to Italy in 1770. At Monte Nuovo, near\nLeghorn, he wrote his delightful \"Humphrey Clinker.\" This was his last\nwork. He died at Leghorn on the 21st October 1771, in the fifty-first\nyear of his age. His widow erected a plain monument to his memory,\nwith an inscription by Dr Armstrong. In 1774 a Tuscan monument was\nerected on the banks of the Leven by his cousin, James Smollett, Esq.,\nof Bonhill. As his wife was left in poor circumstances, the tragedy of\n\"Venice Preserved\" was acted at Edinburgh for her benefit, and the\nmoney remitted to Italy.\n\nSmollett, for variety of powers, and indefatigable industry, has\nseldom been surpassed. He was a politician, a poet, a physician, a\nhistorian, a translator, a writer of travels, a dramatist, a novelist,\na writer on medical subjects, and a miscellaneous author. It is only,\nhowever, as a novelist and a poet that he has any claims to the\nadmiration of posterity. His history survives solely because it is\nusually bound up with Hume's. His translation of \"Don Quixote\" has\nbeen eclipsed by after and more accurate versions. His \"Tour to Italy\"\nis a succession of asthmatic gasps and groans. His \"Regicide\", and\nother plays, are entirely forgotten. So also are his critical,\nmedical, political, and miscellaneous effusions.\n\nIn fiction he is undoubtedly a great original. He had no model, and\nhas had no imitator. His qualities as a novel-writer are rapidity of\nnarrative, variety of incident, ease of style, graphic description,\nand an exquisite eye for the humours, peculiarities, and absurdities\nof character and life. In language he is generally careless, but\nwhenever a great occasion occurs, he rises to meet it, and writes with\ndignity, correctness, and power. His sea-characters, such as Bowling,\nand his characters of low-life, such as Strap, have never been\nexcelled. His tone of morals is always low, and often offensively\ncoarse. In wit, constructiveness, and general style, he is inferior to\nFielding; but surpasses him in interest, ease, variety, and humour,\n\"Roderick Random\" is the most popular and bustling of his tales.\n\"Peregrine Pickle\" is the filthiest and least agreeable; its humours\nare forced and exaggerated, and the sea-characters seem caricatures of\nthose in \"Roderick Random;\" just as Norna of the Fitful Head, and\nMagdalene Graeme, are caricatures of Meg Merriless. \"Sir Lancelot\nGreaves\" is a tissue of trash, redeemed only here and there by traits\nof humour. \"The Adventures of an Atom\" we never read. \"Humphrey\nClinker\" is the most delightful novel, with the exception of the\nWaverley series, in the English language. \"Ferdinand, Count Fathom,\"\ncontains much that is disgusting, but parts of it surpass all the rest\nin originality and profundity. We refer especially to the description\nof the pretended English Squire in Paris, who _bubbles_ the great\n_bubbler_ of the tale; to Count Fathom's address to Britain, when he\nreaches her shores,--a piece of exquisite mock-heroic irony; to the\nnarrative of the seduction in the west of England; and to the\nmatchless robber-scene in the forest,--a passage in which one knows\nnot whether more to admire the thrilling interest of the incidents, or\nthe eloquence and power of the language. It is a scene which Scott has\nnever surpassed, nor, except in the cliff-scene in the \"Antiquary,\"\nand, perhaps, the barn-scene in the \"Heart of Midlothian,\"\never equalled.\n\nSmollett's poetry need not detain us long. In his twin satires,\n\"Advice\" and \"Reproof,\" you see rather the will to wound than the\npower to strike. There are neither the burnished compression, and\npolished, pointed malice of Pope, nor the gigantic force and vehement\nfury of Churchill. His \"Tears of Scotland\" is not thoroughly finished,\nbut has some delicate and beautiful strokes. \"Leven Water\" is sweet\nand murmuring as that stream itself. His \"Ode to Independence,\" as we\nhave said elsewhere, \"should have been written by Burns. How that\npoet's lips must have watered, as he repeated the line--\n\n'Lord of the lion-heart and eagle-eye,'\n\nand remembered he was not their author! He said he would\nhave given ten pounds to have written 'Donochthead'--he\nwould have given ten times ten, if, poor fellow! he had had\nthem, to have written the 'Ode to Independence'--although,\nin his 'Vision of Liberty,' he has matched Smollett on his\nown ground.\" Grander lines than the one we have quoted above,\nand than the following--\n\n\"A goddess violated brought thee forth,\"\n\nare not to be found in literature. Round this last one, the whole ode\nseems to turn as on a pivot, and it alone had been sufficient to stamp\nSmollett a man of lofty poetic genius.\n\n\nSMOLLETT'S POEMS\n\n  ADVICE: A SATIRE.\n\n                        ----Sed podice levi\n  Caeduntur tumidae, medico ridente, mariscae.\n  O proceres! censore opus est, an haruspice nobis?\n\n                                           JUVENAL.\n\n                             ----Nam quis\n  Peccandi finem posuit sibi?

friend, 'tis but a short-lived trance,\n    Dispell'd by one enchanting glance;\n    She need but look, and, I confess,\n    Those looks completely curse or bless.\n\n  6 So soft, so elegant, so fair,\n    Sure something more than human's there;\n    I must submit, for strife is vain,\n    'Twas Destiny that forged the chain.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n  SONG.\n\n  1 Let the nymph still avoid and be deaf to the swain,\n    Who in transports of passion affects to complain;\n    For his rage, not his love, in that frenzy is shown,\n    And the blast that blows loudest is soon overblown.\n\n  2 But the shepherd whom Cupid has pierced to the heart,\n    Will submissive adore, and rejoice in the smart;\n    Or in plaintive, soft murmurs his bosom-felt woe,\n    Like the smooth-gliding current of rivers, will flow.\n\n  3 Though silent his tongue, he will plead with his eyes,\n    And his heart own your sway in a tribute of sighs:\n    But when he accosts you in meadow or grove,\n    His tale is all tenderness, rapture, and love.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n  SONG.\n\n  1 From the man whom I love though my heart I disguise,\n    I will freely describe the wretch I despise;\n    And if he has sense but to balance a straw,\n    He will sure take the hint from the picture I draw.\n\n  2 A wit without sense, without fancy a beau,\n    Like a parrot he chatters, and struts like a crow;\n    A peacock in pride, in grimace a baboon,\n    In courage a hind, in conceit a Gascon.\n\n  3 As a vulture rapacious, in falsehood a fox,\n    Inconstant as waves, and unfeeling as rocks;\n    As a tiger ferocious, perverse as a hog,\n    In mischief an ape, and in fawning a dog.\n\n  4 In a word, to sum up all his talents together,\n    His heart is of lead, and his brain is of feather;\n    Yet, if he has sense but to balance a straw,\n    He will sure take the hint from the picture I draw.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n  SONG.\n\n  1 Come listen, ye students of every degree;\n    I sing of a wit and a tutor _perdie,_\n    A statesman profound, a critic immense,\n    In short, a mere jumble of learning and sense;\n    And yet of his talents though laudably vain,\n    His own family arts he could never attain.\n\n  2 His father, intending his fortune to build,\n    In his youth would have taught him the trowel to wield.\n    But the mortar of discipline never would stick,\n    For his skull was secured by a facing of brick;\n    And with all his endeavours of patience and pain,\n    The skill of his sire he could never attain.\n\n  3 His mother, a housewife, neat, artful, and wise,\n    Renown'd for her delicate biscuit and pies,\n    Soon alter'd his studies, by flattering his taste,\n    From the raising of wall to the rearing of paste;\n    But all her instructions were fruitless and vain,\n    The pye-making mystery he could ne'er attain.\n\n  4 Yet, true to his race, in his labours were seen\n    A jumble of both their professions, I ween;\n    For when his own genius he ventured to trust,\n    His pies seem'd of brick, and his houses of crust;\n    Then, good Mr Tutor, pray be not so vain,\n    Since your family arts you could never attain.\n\n\nEND OF SMOLLETT'S POEMS.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Poetical Works of Johnson, Parnell,\nGray, and Smollett, by Samuel Johnson, Thomas Parnell, Thomas Gray, and Tobias Smollett\n\n*** "
