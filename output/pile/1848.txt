    "text": "Just like the traditional file cabinet, your computer needs to have organized files in order to be able to find important information quickly. As a business owner, searching for client or product files among thousands of documents is a time thief.\n\nFolders\n\nWhen you opened that file cabinet you saw manila folders. In the same way your computer should have folders. And those folders need to be in the right place and labeled correctly. Don\u2019t make the mistake of creating one gigantic folder for all your files. Work smarter not harder; the few minutes it takes you to set up your folders will save time in the long run.\n\nCategories Please\n\nOne effective way to organize your computer files and folders is by category. For example, create one folder for local clients, another for out of state customers and yet a third for international customers. Now use the same strategy for your products, perhaps separating those folders by specific products or services you offer. If you\u2019re not computer proficient consider hiring a Virtual Assistant who is.\n\nSubfolders to Organize Files\n\nUsing subfolders is a necessity to organizing your files but don\u2019t go overboard. Efficient use of subfolders looks like this: create a folder called Products in My Documents, and two subfolders titled Widgets under $100 and Widgets over $100 in the Products folder. Pay attention to how many subfolders you set up because it can be frustrating to open subfolder after subfolder.\n\nUse Caution When Organizing by Date\n\nOrganizing your files by date isn\u2019t that helpful because you\u2019ll have to open the file to see what\u2019s inside. You\u2019ll be pulling your hair out the first time you perform a file search. This method is useless if you arranged your folders this way and have all types of files intermixed with each other. For time sensitive files or documents that you update frequently, like customer lists, be sure to add a clear description before or after the date.\n\nOrganizing by Type\n\nOrganizing your files by type (Word, Excel) is also not best practice. Use this system for mass organizing files you don\u2019t really need. Otherwise, it\u2019ll be \u201cclean up on aisle 5\u201d later, stealing your valuable time.\n\nWhatever method you use, start now. Over time, you\u2018ll be able to expand your folders in a way that works best for you.\n\nContact Us\n\nNecessities\n\nSocial Networking\n\nTestimonials\n\n\"A superb service, they understood my needs right from the start and all the way through, whether your big or small, am confident Contemporary VA can help any organisation or individual meet there outsourcing needs.
