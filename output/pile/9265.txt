    "text": "A fence will not help, they cut the copper out of the air unit they will have no problem cutting the fence around it. The way to stop it is start holding the scrap yards accountable for the scrap they accept. Until there is a penalty this will keep happening over and over.\n\nWe are so screwed folks. The far Right the far Left are pulling the country so hard that all of the rest of us \"in the middle\" are being pulled apart. A country divided starts to blame (just look at the comments).\n\nThis is how I see it ......... A person has a little money, you will stay in jail until you qualify for welfare. A person is on welfare, you will never see a jail cell and you will be back on the street doing whatever got you picked up in the first place. Sounds good but in reality a very very bad idea. A much smarter idea is to put inmates to work cleaning up our streets, boarding up abandon homes, cutting and cleaning up abandon properties. Use them to make our community better no matter what their assets are.\n\nScrap Yard should have to get I.D.'s maybe even finger prints from people turning in copper. I recently sold some gold and had to give my drivers license and thumb print before the money was handed over.\n\n@nohelp ....... the problem with Pickel is no matter how much money he is given nothing will change regarding crime in Genesee County. Pickel is only interested in how it looks, not what it does. His type of law enforcement helps no one it only makes his head bigger and gives him more opportunities to tell us how great he is.\n\nWith these Bill and Joel gone there is no quality news reporting in Genesee County now!!!! I've already started boycotting their advertiser and I will not watch WJRT-12 news anymore. WJRT or your advertisers if you are reading this ....... I'm not alone! Good luck to Joel and Bill. I hope you are hired by a local new organization we need you.\n\nThere is a differance between non-profit and tax exempt. Watch out what you wish for Mr. JohnofGB, you need to work or spend sometime at a non-profit to open your eyes! I've read many of your comments and they are always so blunt with a one sided group of facts. Non-profit agencys are what is holding this very fragile area together. We don't go around saying \"Look at us\" but without the non profit agencies many working families in our area \"maybe even you Mr. GB\" would be out in the cold.\n\nSitting at a computer criticizes the union seems to be a popular topic as of late. Keep in mind the working conditions you have today, union or not are there for you to enjoy because of the unions. Once you get your wish and all the unions are gone, lookout American labor, business will run all over you. Think it will not happen, read your history and see how kind business was to its employees. Unions came to be for a very good reason. I see many problems with the current day unions, but to eliminate the protection and voice unions have brought to us will be the downfall of the middle class.\n\nIts interesting that we are not hearing anything from the Tea Party on this. Its so hypocritical to be so down on taxes one day and turn your back the next. It goes to show the real purpose behind the TEA PARTY.\n\nSnyder says we need to focus on job creation ..... I find this hard to swallow. Are we to believe cutting education both primary and higher education will increase jobs? With our economy in shambles will decreasing social programs increase jobs? By taxing all seniors pensions ..... those who cannot go out and work to help themselves, will this increase jobs? By cutting state shared revenues which will result in less police and more crime, will this increase jobs? Mr. Snyder, our society must take care of its weak, the old, the disadvantaged. Do you have no heart?"
