Code, \u00a7 211).\n\nThe jury could not reach verdicts on allegations Montano was vicariously armed with a\n\nfirearm (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022, subd. (a)(1)), and the court subsequently granted the\n\nprosecution's motion to dismiss these allegations. However, the court found true an\n\nallegation Montano had a prior prison commitment conviction (Pen. Code, \u00a7 667.5, subd.\n\n(b)). The court sentenced Montano to four years in prison.\n\n       Montano appeals, contending the court prejudicially erred in instructing the jury\n\nwith a bracketed paragraph in the CALCRIM No. 400 aiding and abetting instruction\n\nintended for use only when the prosecution is relying on the natural and probable\n\nconsequences doctrine, which the prosecution was not relying on in this case. We\n\nconclude the error was harmless and affirm the judgment.\n\n                                    BACKGROUND\n\n       Two women were standing in a parking lot talking when a four-door silver sedan\n\ndrove in front of them, stopped for a few seconds, and then drove off. A few minutes\n\nlater, the sedan returned and stopped near them again. Montano got out of the sedan's left\n\nrear passenger seat, an accomplice got out of the sedan's front passenger seat, and they\n\napproached the two women. The accomplice pointed a gun at the women, told them not\n\nto scream, and directed them to hand over their purses.1 Montano took one woman's\n\npurse. The accomplice took the other woman's purse. Both women handed over their\n\n\n\n1      Police never found the gun. Both women thought it may have been fake.\n                                             2\n\fpurses because they were afraid for their lives. Montano and the accomplice then got\n\nback into the sedan and left.\n\n       The two women got in a car and tried following the sedan, but they were unable to\n\nfind it and returned to the parking lot. While they were attempting to follow the sedan,\n\none of the women reported the robbery to police. She described the sedan to a 911\n\noperator, stating there was a football emblem on its gas tank door. The other woman\n\nspoke with a police officer at the crime scene. She also described the sedan, indicating it\n\nhad no license plate, but there was a paper with red, white and black writing in the license\n\nplate area.\n\n       A nearby patrol officer heard a radio call about the robbery, which included the\n\nsedan's description. Shortly afterwards, the officer spotted a four-door silver sedan with a\n\nfootball emblem on the gas tank door and paper license plates with red and white\n\nlettering. The officer stopped the car and had its three occupants, including Montano and\n\nhis accomplice, step out of it. At a subsequent curbside lineup, one of the women\n\nidentified both Montano and his accomplice. The other women identified only Montano's\n\naccomplice.\n\n       A field evidence technician searched the sedan and found one woman's purse and\n\nboth women's identification and credit cards. The field evidence technician found one\n\nwoman's wallet and the other woman's purse on the side of the road near the location of\n\nthe robbery.\n\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\f                                         DISCUSSION\n\n                                                I\n\n                                                A\n\n                                                1\n\n       The prosecution's theories of culpability were that Montano aided and abetted the\n\nrobbery of one woman and either directly perpetrated or aided and abetted the robbery of\n\nthe other woman. These theories required the court to instruct on aiding and abetting.\n\n(People v. St. Martin (1970) 1 Cal.3d 524, 531 [a court has a sua sponte duty to instruct\n\nthe jury on the principles of law that are closely and openly connected to the facts of the\n\ncase and are necessary for the jury's understanding of the case].)\n\n       The CALCRIM No. 400 instruction on the general principles of aiding and\n\nabetting provides: \"A person may be guilty of a crime in two ways. One, he or she may\n\nhave directly committed the crime. I will call that person the perpetrator. Two, he or she\n\nmay have aided and abetted a perpetrator, who directly committed the crime. [\u00b6] A\n\nperson is guilty of a crime whether he or she committed it personally or aided and abetted\n\nthe perpetrator. [\u00b6] [Under some specific circumstances, if the evidence establishes\n\naiding and abetting of one crime, a person may also be found guilty of other crimes that\n\noccurred during the commission of the first crime.]\" (Italics added.)\n\n       The bench notes for the instruction state, \"When the prosecution is relying on\n\naiding and abetting, give this instruction before other instructions on aiding and abetting\n\nto introduce this theory of culpability to the jury. [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] If the prosecution is also\n\n\n\n                                                4\n\frelying on the natural and probable consequences doctrine, the court should also instruct\n\nwith the last bracketed paragraph.\"2 (Bench Notes to CALCRIM No. 400 (2010 rev.).)\n\n                                             2\n\n       Although defense counsel objected to the court's use of the bracketed portion of\n\nthe instruction on the ground the prosecution was not relying on the natural and probable\n\nconsequences doctrine, the court overruled the objection stating it did not think the\n\nbracketed portion of the instruction addressed the doctrine. Instead, the court thought the\n\nbracketed portion of the instruction was factually applicable because one could argue \"if\n\n[Montano] was aiding and abetting one robbery, [he] might have actually committed\n\nanother robbery.\" Consistent with this view, the court recited the entire CALCRIM No.\n\n400 instruction to the jury, including the bracketed paragraph.\n\n\n\n\n2       \"The natural and probable consequences route to a finding of criminal liability\noperates as follows: ' \"A person who knowingly aids and abets criminal conduct is guilty\nof not only the intended crime [target offense] but also of any other crime the perpetrator\nactually commits [nontarget offense] that is a natural and probable consequence of the\nintended crime. The latter question is not whether the aider and abettor actually foresaw\nthe additional crime, but whether, judged objectively, it was reasonably foreseeable.\n[Citation.]\" [Citation.] Liability under the natural and probable consequences doctrine\n\"is measured by whether a reasonable person in the defendant's position would have or\nshould have known that the charged offense was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of\nthe act aided and abetted.\" ' [Citation.] In short, natural and probable consequences\nliability for crimes occurs when the accused did not necessarily intend for the ultimate\noffense to occur but was at least negligent (from the standard expected of a reasonable\nperson in the accused's position) about the possibility that committing the proximate\noffense would precipitate the ultimate offense that actually occurred.\" (People v. Rivas\n(2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 1410, 1431-1432 (Rivas).)\n                                             5\n\f                                              B\n\n       However, the court's aiding and abetting instructions did not end with CALCRIM\n\nNo. 400. The bench notes to CALCRIM No. 400 further explained, \"If the prosecution's\n\ntheory is that the defendant intended to aid and abet the crime or crimes charged (target\n\ncrimes), give CALCRIM No. 401, Aiding and Abetting: Intended Crimes.\" (Bench\n\nNotes to CALCRIM No. 400 (2010 rev.).) \"If the prosecution's theory is that any of the\n\ncrimes charged were committed as a natural and probable consequence of the target\n\ncrime, CALCRIM No. 402 or 403 should also be given.\" (Bench Notes to CALCRIM\n\nNo. 400 (2010 rev.).)\n\n       Following the bench notes' guidance and based on the prosecution's theory\n\nMontano intended to aid and abet a robbery, the court did not give the jury either the\n\nCALCRIM No. 402 or 403 instructions on the natural and probable consequences\n\ndoctrine. Rather, using a tailored version of CALCRIM No. 401, the court instructed the\n\njury in relevant part: \"To prove the defendant is guilty of a crime based on aiding and\n\nabetting, that crime, the People must prove that, one, the perpetrator committed a crime;\n\ntwo, the defendant knew that the perpetrator intended to commit the crime; three, before\n\nor during the commission of the crime, the defendant intended to aid and abet the\n\nperpetrator in committing the crime; and four, the defendant's words or conduct did, in\n\nfact, aid or abet the perpetrator's commission of the crime.\n\n       \"Someone aids and abets a crime if he or she knows of the perpetrator's unlawful\n\npurpose and he or she specifically intends to and does, in fact, aid, facilitate, promote,\n\nencourage or instigate the perpetrator's commission of that crime. [\u00b6] If all of these\n\n                                              6\n\frequirements are proved, the defendant does not need to actually have been present when\n\nthe crime was committed to be guilty as an aider and abettor. If you conclude the\n\ndefendant was present at the scene of a crime or failed to prevent a crime, you may\n\nconsider that fact in determining whether the defendant was an aider and abettor.\n\nHowever, the fact that a person is present at the scene of the crime or fails to prevent the\n\ncrime does not, by itself, make him or her an aider and abettor.\"\n\n                                              II\n\n                                              A\n\n       Montano contends we must reverse his conviction because the court's erroneous\n\nuse of the bracketed portion of the CALCRIM No. 400 instruction deprived him of due\n\nprocess of law. Specifically, he contends the error likely led the jury to convict him of\n\nrobbery even if the jury did not believe his accomplice intended to commit a robbery or\n\nhe intended to aid and abet the accomplice in committing a robbery, but instead only\n\nbelieved he intended to assist the accomplice in committing a lesser offense or only\n\nintended to commit a lesser offense himself.\n\n       The People concede the instructional error. (Rivas, supra, 214 Cal.App.4th at\n\np. 1432 [the bracketed portion of the CALCRIM No. 400 instruction is superfluous if the\n\nprosecution is not relying upon the natural and probable consequences doctrine].)\n\nHowever, the People contend the error was harmless. We agree.\n\n                                              B\n\n       \" 'With regard to criminal trials, \"not every ambiguity, inconsistency, or deficiency\n\nin a jury instruction rises to the level of a due process violation. The question is\n\n                                               7\n\f' \"whether the ailing instruction ... so infected the entire trial that the resulting conviction\n\nviolates due process.\" ' [Citation.] ' \"[A] single instruction to a jury may not be judged in\n\nartificial isolation, but must be viewed in the context of the overall charge.\" ' [Citation.]\n\nIf the charge as a whole is ambiguous, the question is whether there is a ' \"reasonable\n\nlikelihood that the jury has applied the challenged instruction in a way\" that violates the\n\nConstitution.' \" ' \" (People v. Letner and Tobin (2010) 50 Cal.4th 99, 182; Rivas, supra,\n\n214 Cal.App.4th at p. 1429 & fn. 9.)\n\n       In this case, Montano essentially argues the jury mistakenly and incorrectly\n\napplied the natural and probable consequences doctrine even though neither party\n\ndiscussed the doctrine during closing arguments and the only instruction the jury received\n\nrelated to the doctrine was the bracketed paragraph, not the details of the doctrine itself.\n\nIn substantially similar circumstances, the Supreme Court concluded it is highly unlikely\n\nthe jury relied upon or misapplied the doctrine in a constitutionally impermissible way.\n\n(People v. Prettyman (1996) 14 Cal.4th 248, 273; Rivas, supra, 214 Cal.App.4th at\n\npp. 1432-1433.)\n\n       Moreover, viewing the instructions as a whole in light of the trial record (Estelle v.\n\nMcGuire (1991) 502 U.S. 62, 72), we conclude the jury would have understood its task to\n\nbe determining whether Montano aided and abetted the robbery of one woman and\n\nwhether he directly perpetrated or aided and abetted the robbery of, or some lesser form\n\nof theft against, the other woman. Indeed, this is precisely how both parties framed the\n\nissues in their closing arguments.\n\n\n\n                                                8\n\f       Within this framework, the prosecution argued Montano and his accomplice\n\nworked together to rob both women. Defense counsel argued Montano committed the\n\nlesser offense of grand theft from the person of one woman and could not be found\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt to have aided and abetted in the robbery of the other woman.\n\nNeither party addressed Montano's potential culpability for a nontarget crime based on\n\nhis aiding and abetting a target crime. The jury, therefore, could only have based its\n\nverdicts on its agreement with the prosecution's theories of culpability and not on the\n\nnatural and probable consequences doctrine or some other speculative theory. (Rivas,\n\nsupra, 214 Cal.App.4th at p. 1433.) Accordingly, we conclude beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt the error did not contribute to the jury's verdict. (Id. at p. 1430, fn. 10, citing\n\nChapman v. California (1967) 386 U.S. 18, 24.)\n\n                                       DISPOSITION\n\n       The judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                          McCONNELL, P.
