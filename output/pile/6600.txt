    "text": "Ain\u2019t it a bitch when you\u2019re excited for a workout one day, yet it goes horribly? The weights that you normally rep-out on any other day are pinning you down on this certain day. Nothing else quite smacks the ego like a poor workout does.\n\nWhat explains an unprovoked drop in performance in the weight room? Well, if you\u2019ve got the flu or injured one of your joints, it\u2019s pretty self-explanatory. Barring an injury or illness, there are a few reasons why your workout went down the drain.\n\nLast Night\u2019s Sleep Was Nothing to Brag About\n\nI\u2019ve observed many people stumble into the gym after staying up really late (or for the entire night) and still successfully push through a workout. I\u2019ve observed just as many do the same thing, but fail to complete their workout. They just gas out immediately, and that\u2019s it. Bad workout: 1, lifter: 0.\n\nIt\u2019s logical. Sleep provides you with recovery from the previous day and energy for the following day. In fact, less time until exhaustion as well as increased perceived effort is correlated with sleep deprivation (Van Helder et. al). Failing to sleep well the night before isn\u2019t a guarantee for poor performance, but it\u2019s a bet you\u2019re taking against yourself.\n\nYou Drank Like a Fish, Ate Like Crap, or Are Dehydrated\n\nIf you stayed up all night drinking, I think it\u2019s safe to say you\u2019re not going to be impressive in the gym the next day. Let\u2019s say you drank quite a bit of alcohol earlier in the night and went to bed at a reasonable time. Should you still worry about your workout performance being effected? Depending on the amount of alcohol consumed, your \u201cfull night of sleep\u201d may very well have been not so restorative and energizing. It appears that heavy alcohol-consumption decreases sleep quality (Carole et. al) (Roehrs, et. al).\n\nNow, I\u2019ve got no evidence for this, but I believe eating a big greasy, unhealthy meal the night before can cause a bad workout, as well. I\u2019ve experienced it a number of times. After getting some chicken fingers and mozzarella sticks, bad things happen in the gym for me. You\u2019d think an excess of food would fuel the following workout! It\u2019s difficult to explain, but my guess that despite this excess food, the quality (or lack of) I consume can make or break a workout. Broscience, yo.\n\nNow, dehydration is another obvious no-no for gym performance. If you wake up, urinate dark yellow liquid, and head straight to the gym, expect a bad workout. Dehydration negatively affects all aspects of fitness without fail (Judelson et. al).\n\nYour Head\u2019s Not in the Game\n\nThe mind is a powerful entity. Mere thoughts can influence the body to perform incredible things. Take the placebo-effect, for example. Simply taking a sugar pill but falsely believing it is medicine can cause someone to experience positive medicinal effects.\n\nIf that is possible through the power of thinking, it doesn\u2019t seem so far-fetched that mental state can affect physical performance. We\u2019re all aware of the \u201chome court advantage\u201d. You\u2019ve got two rival sports teams facing off at one-or-the-other\u2019s home court/field/stadium/whatever. Despite the physical location of the game having no direct effect on a player\u2019s skill or performance, playing home is still considered an advantage. It\u2019s 100% mental, yet one study found did find an advantage for teams playing at home in college basketball (Harville et. al).\n\nSo what if you\u2019re not having a good day? Maybe you broke up with you significant other or someone at work put you down. Should you be afraid of having a bad workout (and further ruining your day)? Well, we\u2019ve all seen and heard of athletes/lifters/etc. performing like crap while \u201cnot having a good day\u201d. I have a difficult time arguing that mental state has no effect on physical performance.\n\nDoing Your Best to Avoid Bad Workouts\n\nLife happens. Occasionally, we cannot avoid the inevitable and suffer the consequences afterwards. Plenty of people don\u2019t plan on getting piss drunk, binging on fast food, having insomnia, or feeling like a sad panda. We can\u2019t always prevent these events that are pretty negative to our health and performance. Sometimes, avoiding a bad workout is the last thing on our minds.\n\nYet, some people do amazingly well at keeping their performance to the max and avoiding bad workouts. Look at professional athletes. These folks train day-in and day-out, and are the best of the best. They surely can\u2019t afford a bad workout. No way.\n\nHow do they do it? Well, they do everything they can to keep their bodies as tuned up as possible. This includes: sleeping 9+ hours every night, eating only the best quality foods, not partying or staying out late, avoiding excess booze/drugs/vices, and separating themselves from anything or anyone that may screw with their mental state. Granted, these guys and gals make physical performance their careers. It would be very impractical for a lay-person to mimic this lifestyle.\n\nThe takeaway is, however, that you and others can probably improve your lifestyle to prevent bad workouts and mishaps. Some ups and downs in the gym may not mean much to you, but take a look again at the potential causes for a bad workout. All of these are associated with an unhealthy lifestyle. Poor diet, poor sleep, stress \u2013 why would you want these things in your life anyway?\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nPeople will experience bad workouts from time-to-time. Poor sleep, poor diet/hydration, excessive alcohol (and other vices), and a poor mental state can screw up your physical performance. If physical performance isn\u2019t a top priority for you, consider the fact that these \u201ccauses\u201d may also negatively affect your health in general.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.
