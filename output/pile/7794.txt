Did you get the message?\n\nIsrael carried out a nuclear test in the South Atlantic, the latest revelation tells which was suppressed for 40 years. Israel never signed to any treaty that oversees activities that could be deemed harmful whether nuclear, chemical, biological, even human rights abuses. They can get away with it only with a super power's absolute support.\n\nIsrael is a rogue state by all standards, its policies since the first immigrants were shipped to Palestine which was under the British occupation has not been less than evil, starting with introducing terror to the world by the likes of the Haganah, Stern, Irgun and other terrorist groups that later were merged under the IDF umbrella, to assassinations of notables and dignitaries, to massacres of complete villages like Deir Yassin, to massacres of complete refugee camps like Sabra and Shatella in South Lebanon, to massacres of refugee children taking shelter in United Nations designated buildings like Qana 1 and Qana 2, to sniping children and kidnapping others, placing thousands of Semite Palestinians in concentration camps, it's endless.\n\nAgain, they can only get away with all these crimes against humanity with the full support of a super power, or more than one super power, like the USA, Britain, France, and heavyweights like Germany and others.\n\nIraq got invaded and destroyed despite obliging to UNSC resolutions, same with Libya, former Yugoslavia, and numerous other states, but Israel has rejected to implement dozens of UNSC and UNGA resolutions, was spared of over 70 UNSC resolutions condemning its policies, just why?\n\nThe USAians keep wondering why the rest of the world hates them, especially the people of the Middle East, here's the best reason: Because you support terrorists, criminals, rogue states, and you are by yourself a rogue superpower.\n\nThe above report was first published in Foreign Policy magazine and the cover story screenshot above taken from Israeli Haaretz magazine.\n\nFollow @ArabiSouri\n\non Twitter: Arabi Souri\n\nSyria News: www.syrianews.cc\n\nDonations are highly appreciated, just click on the Donate button via PayPal or Credit Card: Donate\n\nYou can also donate with Steem or SBD or even delegate some much needed SP here :)\n\n#Syria #Iran #Russia #InformationWar #Wahhabism #Zionism #alQaeda #FSA #Nusra #ISIS #Terrorism #Saudi #Qatar #Israel #Net #Neutrality #Mainstream #MSM #Control #WarOfTerror #RegimeChange\n\nPosted using Partiko Android"
