    "text": "A perusal of his draft reveals \u2018radical Islamic terrorism\u2019 is conspicuously missing.\n\nEven as his administration fights for its travel ban from several Muslim-majority countries, President Donald Trump is using the nation that is home to Islam\u2019s holiest site as a backdrop to call for Muslim unity in the fight against terrorism.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s Sunday speech, the centerpiece of his two-day visit to Saudi Arabia, will address the leaders of 50 Muslim-majority countries to cast the challenge of extremism as a \u201cbattle between good and evil\u201d and urge Arab leaders to \u201cdrive out the terrorists from your places of worship,\u201d according to a draft of the speech obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nMr. Trump, whose campaign was frequently punctuated by bouts of anti-Islamic rhetoric, is poised to soften some of his language about Islam. Though during the campaign he repeatedly stressed the need to say the words \u201cradical Islamic terrorism\u201d and criticized his opponent, Hillary Clinton, for not doing so, that phrase is not included in the draft.\n\nThe speech comes amid a renewed courtship of the United States\u2019 Arab allies as Mr. Trump is set to have individual meetings with leaders of several nations, including Egypt and Qatar, before then participating in a roundtable with the Gulf Cooperation Council and joining Saudi King Salman in opening Riyadh\u2019s new anti-terrorism center.\n\nNo mention of democracy & rights\n\nThe address also notably refrains from mentioning democracy and human rights topics Arab leaders often view as U.S. moralizing in favor of the more limited goals of peace and stability.\n\n\u201cWe are not here to lecture to tell other peoples how to live, what to do or who to be. We are here instead to offer partnership in building a better future for us all,\u201d according to the copy of his speech.\n\nTwo different sources provided the AP with copies of the draft of his remarks, billed as a marquee speech of the trip. The White House confirmed the draft was authentic, but cautioned the President had not yet signed off on the final product and that changes could be made.\n\nMr. Trump may seem an unlikely messenger to deliver an olive branch to the Muslim world.\n\nDuring his campaign, he mused, \u201cI think Islam hates us.\u201d And only a week after taking office, he signed an executive order to ban immigrants from seven countries Iraq, Iran, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Somalia, and Yemen from entering the United States, a decision that sparked widespread protests at the nation\u2019s airports and demonstrations outside the White House.\n\nThat ban was blocked by the courts. A second order, which dropped Iraq from the list, is tied up in federal court and the federal government is appealing.\n\n\u2018Counterweight to Obama\u2019s speech\u2019\n\nWhite House officials have said they consider Mr. Trump\u2019s visit, and his keynote address, a counterweight to President Barack Obama\u2019s debut speech to the Muslim world in 2009 in Cairo.\n\nMr. Obama called for understanding and acknowledged some of America\u2019s missteps in the region. That speech was denounced by many Republicans and criticized by a number of the United States\u2019 Middle East allies as being a sort of apology.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s leaders soured on Mr. Obama, and King Salman did not greet him at the airport during his final visit to the kingdom. But on Saturday, the 81-year-old king, aided by a cane, walked along the red carpet to meet Mr. Trump as a fleet of military jets swept through the sky, leaving a red, white and blue trail in their wake. During a ceremony at the grand Saudi Royal Court, the king awarded Mr. Trump the Collar of Abdulaziz al Saud, the theocracy\u2019s highest civilian honor.\n\nMr. Trump bent down so that the king could place the gold medal around his neck. Saudi Arabia has previously bestowed the honor on Russian President Vladimir Putin, British Prime Minister Theresa May and Mr. Obama.\n\nFirst such visit\n\nThe President\u2019s stop in Saudi Arabia\u2019s dusty desert capital kicked off his first foreign trip as President, an ambitious, five-stop swing that will take him through the Middle East and into Europe. He\u2019s the only American President to make Saudi Arabia or any Muslim-majority nation his first overseas visit.\n\nMr. Trump arrived in Riyadh besieged by the fallout from his controversial decision to fire FBI Director James Comey and more revelations about the federal investigations into his campaign\u2019s possible ties to Russia. But escaping Washington for the gold-plated embrace of the Saudi royal family \u2014 a decor not so unlike Mr. Trump\u2019s own Manhattan home appeared to give the President a boost.\n\nThe President was largely kept out of earshot from reporters, rendering them unable to ask about the tumult back home. But he did make a brief utterance to the press pool, deeming the proceedings \u201ca tremendous day.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump is scheduled to leave Saudi Arabia \u2014 home to Mecca, the holiest site in Islam \u2014 early on Monday to head to Israel."
