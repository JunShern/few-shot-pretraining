The rationale behind it seems to be that rivers which flow from north to south (in the northern hemisphere), or south to north (in the southern), and therefore towards the bulge at the equator, will flow into mouths which are further from the centre of the earth than their sources.\n\n4) Rivers run down to sea-level finding the easiest course, North, South, East, West and all other intermediary directions over the Earth at the same time. If Earth were truly a spinning ball then many of these rivers would be impossibly flowing uphill, for example the Mississippi in its 3000 miles would have to ascend 11 miles before reaching the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nContent from external source\n\nAs with most (all?) of Dubay's 'proofs', no explanation or evidence is offered, and it appears he is merely quoting from one of the Victorian 'first-wave' flat earth texts. In this case, rather than Rowbotham, he uses 'Terra Firma: The Earth not a Planet', a scripture-inspired book written in 1901 by David Wardlaw Scott.\n\nWhoever heard of a river in any part of its course flowing uphill? Yet this it would require to do were the Earth a Globe. Rivers, like the Mississippi, which flow from the North southwards towards the Equator, would need, according to Modern Astronomic theory, to run upwards, as the Earth at the Equator is said to bulge out considerably more, or, in other words, is higher than at any other part. Thus the Mississippi, in its immense course of over 3,000 miles, would have to ascend 11 miles before it reached the Gulf of Mexico!\n\nContent from external source\n\nHow he arrives at the figure of 11 miles he doesn't say, though he does reference an 'Imperial Gazetteer' article, so it's possible he took it from this. In any case, I think we can assume that he did a rough calculation that went something along the lines of:\n\n1. Earth's radius is 13.5 miles larger at equator than at poles\n2. Length of Mississippi @3000 miles is 48% of the distance from the north pole to the equator (6215 miles)\n3. Radius to mouth - radius to source = approximately 48% of 13.5\n4. Answer is that the mouth is 6.24 miles 'higher' than the source (after subtracting 1,475 feet for the elevation at source)\n5. Write down 11 miles, 'cos reasons.\n\nNow, in actual fact the Mississippi is 2,320 miles long, while its 'as the crow flies' distance between source and mouth is 1,288 miles, and the distance between the lines of latitude at its source and mouth 1,248 miles. Using the above technique, this would make the mouth 2.44 miles 'higher' (further from the centre of the earth) than its source.\n\nThat's just a rough figure, of course, but one I would have expected a Victorian flat earth 'scientist' to have arrived at.\n\nSo there you go! The mouth of the Mississippi is not 11 miles higher than its source, it's a little under 4. Which is not an explanation of how this is possible, but another example of how Dubay repeats incorrect information without ever checking it, and yet presents it as fact.\n\nThe explanation is a little more straightforward than the laboured 'background check' above:\n\nThe Mississippi River (or any river flowing toward the equator) actually flows uphill. The Earth is not a perfect sphere. There is an equatorial ring about 13.5 miles deep. In other words \u201csea level\u201d is not constant. It is higher at the equator than it is at the poles.\n\nIn the case of the Mississippi the difference is 4.12 miles. The source of the Mississippi, Lake Itasca, is 1400 feet above sea level, and the mouth is, by definition, zero feet above sea level. So we think of all of that water flowing downhill 1400 feet. But it is actually flowing against the force of gravity, going four miles uphill. The force that keeps the water flowing is actually the centrifugal force of the earth\u2019s rotation.\n\nIf we did measurements of the flow of the water, only the effect of gravity would be observable. But that\u2019s only because we\u2019re using \u201csea level\u201d as our reference in the first place. And the difference in sea level is itself caused by that same centrifugal force. So its effect is cancelled out in the measurements that we make.\n\nCounter-intuitively, the gravitational force is much smaller than the centrifugal force. This is demonstrated by the fact that the centrifugal force lifts not only the water, but also the entire crust of the Earth, more than 13 miles at the equator.\n\nContent from external source\n\nWhy my calculation was 0.4 miles different to theirs, I'm not sure. But similar enough to debunk the \"11 mile\" claim. And whatever the figure, the explanation is still the same.\n\nSorry it was so long: I just like 'taking it back to the source' and uncovering the shoddyness in these \"proofs\".\n\nAn equatorial bulge is a difference between the equatorial and polar diameters of a planet, due to the centripetal force of its rotation. A rotating body tends to form an oblate spheroid rather than a sphere. The Earth has an equatorial bulge of 42.77 km (26.58 mi): that is, its diameter measured across the equatorial plane (12,756.27 km (7,926.38 mi)) is 42.77 km more than that measured between the poles (12,713.56 km (7,899.84 mi)). An observer standing at sea level on either pole, therefore, is 21.36 km closer to Earth's centrepoint than if standing at sea level on the equator. The value of Earth's radius may be approximated by the average of these radii.\n\nIn @ericdubay's \"200 proofs\" list he claims that rivers such as the Nile, the Paran\u00e1, the Congo, the Paraguay, and the Mississippi \"flow uphill\". The rationale behind it seems to be that rivers which flow from north to south or south to north, and therefore towards the bulge at the equator, will potentially possess mouths which are further from the centre of the earth than their sources.\n\n4) Rivers run down to sea-level finding the easiest course, North, South, East, West and all other intermediary directions over the Earth at the same time. If Earth were truly a spinning ball then many of these rivers would be impossibly flowing uphill, for example the Mississippi in its 3000 miles would have to ascend 11 miles before reaching the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nContent from external source\n\nAs with most (all?) of Dubay's 'proofs', no explanation or evidence is offered, and it appears he is merely quoting from one of the Victorian 'first-wave' flat earth texts. In this case, rather than Rowbotham, he uses 'Terra Firma: The Earth not a Planet', a scripture-inspired book written in 1901 by David Wardlaw Scott.\n\nThanks for sorting out the figures here. When I was first caught up in arguing with Dubay's supposed 200 proofs of flatness, this was one of a number that caused me to have to think carefully just to make any sense of what he was claiming. It's an interesting exercise reverse engineering his misconception, isn't it.\n\nI tried to frame the replies with the minimum technicality, not only because of some uncertainty on my part in places, but because debating on YouTube under his video taught me that I was next thing to a Nobel laureate compared to the average level of background knowledge there. Hence I ended up talking about spinning pizza dough to explain the earth's oblateness.\n\nI've included a link to this thread at roundearthsense.blogspot.co.uk. Every little helps, even if the likelihood of most FE believers taking note is small.\n\nYes, or rather, the reason the mouth is further from the earth's centre than the source is because the Earth is spinning.\n\nAll that matters is the potential energy. Rivers flow downhill relative to the geoid, ie the surface of the Earth that has an equal potential energy. That potential energy is the result of a combination of the downward force due to gravity and the upward force due to the Earth's rotation (\"centrifugal force\" in layman's terms).\n\nThe geoid is the shape that the surface of the oceans would take under the influence of Earth's gravitation and rotation alone, in the absence of other influences such as winds and tides. This surface is extended through the continents (such as with very narrow hypothetical canals). All points on the geoid have the same gravity potential energy (the sum of gravitational potential energy and centrifugal potential energy). The force of gravity acts everywhere perpendicular to the geoid, meaning that plumb lines point perpendicular and water levels parallel to the geoid.\n\nThe reason the mouth is further from the earth's centre than the source is because the Earth is spinning.\n\nClick to expand...\n\nAlso, that the Mississippi flows towards the equator is arbitrary, really, purely because its source (highest point above mean sea level) is in the north and its mouth (lowest point amsl) is in the south. A river could just as easily flow from south to north, away from the equator, like the Mackenzie in Canada, or from south to north and south again, crossing the equator twice, such as the Congo in Africa.\n\nAlso, that the Mississippi flows towards the equator is arbitrary, really, purely because its source (highest point amsl) is in the north and its mouth (lowest point amsl) is in the south. A river could just as easily flow from south to north, away from the equator, like the Mackenzie in Canada, or from south to north and south again, crossing the equator twice, such as the Congo in Africa.\n\nClick to expand...\n\nwhat's amsl? let's remember people, a debunk is only as good as the number of people who can understand it.\n\nI have made the account on metabunk in order to see how the \"flowing uphill\" problem is adressed and I found this thread.\n\nIf the Mississippi is flowing towards equator because the earth is spinning that would not be an uniform motion, but an uniform accelerate motion, resulting in a speed of water which is not matched by reality. As any other river the Mississippi speed is greater toward Itasca lake at a similar slope of the riverbed. Only the volume of the water is bigger toward the Gulf of Mexico, which means we need more energy to move the water uphill.\n\nIf we take into consideration a certain volume of water, can we calculate a point on the riverbed where the centrifugal force is not enough to move that volume uphill because it became equal with the gravitational force of the volume of water from that point to the Gulf of Mexico?\n\nThe Mississippi flows towards the equator because the Gulf of Mexico is at a lower altitude than Lake Itasca. At no point does the centripetal force of earths rotation overcome gravity, because if that were the case the planet would simply break apart.\n\nIf the Mississippi is flowing towards equator because the earth is spinning.\n\nClick to expand...\n\nAs pointed out above, that's not why the Mississippi flows towards the equator, but rather because its mouth (at sea level) is located to the south of its source (1475 feet amsl). It's actually kind of arbitrary that it flows \"towards the equator\" - it's simple probability that, of all the rivers in the world, some will flow south (in the northern hemisphere), and some north (in the southern hemisphere), and therefore \"towards the equator\". But what they all have in common is that they flow from a higher elevation to a lower one (as measured in relation to sea level).\n\nAs any other river the Mississippi speed is greater toward Itasca lake at a similar slope of the riverbed.\n\nClick to expand...\n\nI'm not really sure what this means. Is the speed you refer to the velocity of the water flow? Why would this be the case? Wouldn't the speed of the water depend on other more localized factors, such as width, depth, tributaries, cascades, snowmelt, etc?\n\nOnly the volume of the water is bigger toward the Gulf of Mexico, which means we need more energy to move the water uphill.\n\nClick to expand...\n\nThough it's been described as doing so elsewhere, I don't think the river can be said to actually \"flow uphill\" - it is still flowing 'down', towards the sea - though in one sense I get your point, since it is moving further away from \"the centre of gravity\". In general, though, we define higher and lower by their relation to sea level, rather than the centre of the earth - which is why Mount Everest is viewed as the highest mountain, rather than Ecuador's Mount Chimborazo.\n\nIf we take into consideration a certain volume of water, can we calculate a point on the riverbed where the centrifugal force is not enough to move that volume uphill because it became equal with the gravitational force of the volume of water from that point to the Gulf of Mexico?\n\nClick to expand...\n\nAs above. And, if you think about the oceans that straddle the equator, it becomes clear that the volume of water isn't really a factor in this.\n\nGood questions, though: it definitely takes a little while to get one's head around it.\n\nPS Your English is fantastic!\n\nPPS An interesting question for flat earthers - why did scientists, whose job it is to hide the fact we \"don't live on a spinning ball\", suddenly decide to describe this \"fictional globe\" as being an \"oblate spheroid\", thereby creating a whole bunch of myriad problems which wouldn't be understood by the layman, thereby opening the door to more arguments from incredulity? One would think they'd have been better off just keeping it simple.\n\nI have made the account on metabunk in order to see how the \"flowing uphill\" problem is adressed and I found this thread.\n\nIf the Mississippi is flowing towards equator because the earth is spinning that would not be an uniform motion, but an uniform accelerate motion, resulting in a speed of water which is not matched by reality.

On Earth, we measure altitudes relative to mean sea level. And the whole point of that is that the sea finds its own level: namely, it settles to the configuration where it has the lowest potential energy. (Minor fluctuations due to tides and atmospheric pressure patterns aside.)\n\nSo effectively you can treat sea level as being a \"lowest energy surface\" that water will flow down towards. That's what \"down\" means: travelling from higher potential energy to lower potential energy.\n\nIf the globe was a stationary ball of uniform density then sea level would form a perfect sphere, because the only force would be gravity. However, because it rotates, the centripetal centrifugal force (which is highest at the equator) offsets a small fraction of the gravitational force, resulting in sea level bulging outwards a little at the equator. But sea level still represents the lowest energy surface, so anything above sea level is still \"uphill\" from it.\n\nThe distance from the centre of the Earth is irrelevant: what matters is the distance above sea level - or, more precisely, above the \"geoid\", which is the surface of equal potential energy, taking into account gravity, centrifugal force and variations in density. The source of the Mississippi at Lake Itasca is about 1,500ft above sea level, so clearly the river will flow downwards to the sea.\n\nTrying to separate out the gravitational and centripetal components is not really helpful. All that matters is where you are relative to sea level, because the sea does the work of finding the \"lowest energy\" shape for you.\n\nIf the Mississippi is flowing towards equator because the earth is spinning\n\nClick to expand...\n\nRivers go downhill, taking the path of least resistance. The Mississippi just happens to go south. The Rhine in Europe and The Nile in Africa both spend most of their courses going in a Northerly direction towards the North Sea and the Mediterranean respectively. In South America the Amazon and The Orinoco both head East towards the Atlantic, while going back to Africa the Congo flows mainly in a westerly direction, again to Atlantic. Its all down to gravity and the path of least resistance, the spinning of the earth has nothing to do with it.\n\nAm I missing something? I guess you could claim it would be more precise to use centripetal and gravitational acceleration?\n\nClick to expand...\n\n\"The most basic rule of dimensional analysis is that of dimensional homogeneity.[6] Only commensurable quantities (physical quantities having the same dimension) may be compared, equated, added, or subtracted. \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis\nI am not bothered by centripetal v centrifugal, or whether you compare forces or accelerations.\n\nThe St. Johns River, in Florida, flows from south to north.

Sorry, will try to elaborate -- The St. Johns flows from topography (high to low). Given that the elevation change is very small given the length of the watershed/river, basic physics would indicate that any outside influence (other than simple gravity) would have a noticeable influence on the flow and direction of the river. Having lived here for more than 30 yrs, I can attest that the St. Johns flows south to north. The St. Johns river flows downhill, regardless of the compass direction.\n\nI'm not really sure what you mean by \"the TGP=0 line\" but, basically, the rivers in Florida, like everywhere in the world, are following routes from higher elevations to lower elevations, eventually reaching sea level.

This means sea level is not always the same distance from the centre of the earth, but neither the rotation nor the shape of the planet have any bearing on which directions rivers flow in: that is solely subject to changes in elevation (above sea level) and topography.\n\nRory, no sweat. I had to dredge up my high school physics after Irma, as had to drain down pool with no power (for four days). Set up a garden hose siphon, and viola! Overnight, drained 4 inches of water from pool to (lower elevation) backyard. No harm, no foul, just communicating!\n\nIf the earth stopped spinning, (but somehow maintained its oblate shape!), the Mississippi would not flow south, and the oceans would pile up in the northern and southern hemispheres.\n\nIf the earth did rotate, but somehow was a perfect sphere and did not have an equatorial bulge, the seas would pile up around the equator and leave the northern and southern poles dry. As Newton argued.\n\nBut neither situation is possible, because land and sea are both matter and are affected in identical ways by gravity and \"centrifugal force.\"\n\nThe simplest, intuitive way to understand this is: \"Centrifugal force\" creates the earth's bulge -AND- this same exact \"force\" also helps water flow that same distance farther away from the center of the earth's mass. It's the same force and it has the same effect on land and sea. That's natural, isn't it?\n\nToday, all three world oceans are connected. This creates a global ocean with basically one sea level. As a consequence of rotational slowdown, the outline of the global ocean would continuously undergo dramatic changes. Equatorial waters would move toward polar areas, initially causing a significant reduction in depth while filling the polar basins that have much less capacity. As regions at high latitude in the northern hemisphere become submerged, the areal extent of the northern circumpolar ocean would rapidly expand, covering the vast lowlands of Siberia and northern portions of North America. The global ocean would remain one unit until the rotation of the earth decreased to the speed at which ocean separation would occur. The interaction between the inertia of huge water bodies and decreasing centrifugal force would be very complicated. As the consequence of steady slowdown of earth's rotation, the global ocean would be gradually separated into two oceans. Obviously, the last connection will be broken at the lowest point of the global divide line, located southwest of the Kiribati Islands. Since the current western Pacific Ocean is a plane, land would emerge quickly because there would be no chance that water would be exchanged between the two circumpolar oceans after the initial split. The area of final separation between the two oceans would be the simultaneous emerging and drying of territory extending for hundreds of kilometers.\n\nContent from external source\n\n...during the Devonian period (400 million years ago), the earth rotated about 40 more times during one revolution around the sun than it does now. Because the continents have drifted significantly since that time, it is difficult to make estimates of the land versus ocean outlines for that era. However, we can be certain that\u2014with a faster spinning speed in the past\u2014the equatorial bulge of oceanic water was much larger then than it is today. Similarly, the ellipsoidal flattening of the earth was also more significant.\n\nContent from external source\n\nThat last is important because one mustn't imagine that the earth's current equatorial bulge is a legacy of an earlier time when the earth rotated faster. It wasn't solidified or frozen into the earth. It's a dynamic system. The present equatorial bulge is a result of the current speed of the earth's rotation.\n\nThere are different flavors of the FE belief in rivers flowing the wrong way.\n\n1. The most common: FE believers have a naive intuitive belief that south is \"down\" and north is \"up\" simply because maps and globes traditionally are made to be displayed that way. It goes back to the immutable direction of \"down.\" In this case it's not the Mississippi that outrages them. It's the Nile. The Nile flows \"up.\" To them the sphere earth is an impossible figure to live on, with most of it either a vertical surface or upside down.\n\n2. Another common one: The earth curves such and such miles along the course of the river; therefore the river would have to climb (or fall) such and such miles. Confusing curve with gain or loss in elevation.\n\n3. The more savvy argument is a legacy from Victorian Edwardian times when Rowbotham David Wardlaw Scott produced more skilled sophistries. And it's exactly that argument you presented in the OP. That water would have to \"climb\" the \"slope\" of the equatorial bulge, away from the center of the earth and fighting gravity.\n\nAlthough this antique FE argument is presented, only a minority of current day FE believers actually understand it on any level. When these same are presented with the argument that water is helped up the bulge by centrifugal force they become outraged at the silly ad hoc nature of this. It would be a bizarrely unlikely coincidence that centrifugal force would give water just the exact amount of force to \"climb\" the \"slope\" of the bulge - no more, no less. This is because they don't link the bulge itself to that same centrifugal force. They seem to think it's just an arbitrary lump or what-not.\n\nRowbotham David Wardlaw Scott had no excuse to make this argument, as Isaac Newton had explained all this long before he was born.\n\nIf the globe was a stationary ball of uniform density then sea level would form a perfect sphere, because the only force would be gravity. However, because it rotates, the centripetal centrifugal force (which is highest at the equator) offsets a small fraction of the gravitational force, resulting in sea level bulging outwards a little at the equator.

Now we have two possibilities: in the first case the altitude is included in r2, where r2 is the Earth radii at the source of Mississippi latitude, in the second case the altitude of the Itasca lake is not included in r2.\n\nIf you calculate r1, the Earth radii at the Mississippi mouth latitude, you will have a diference r2-r1 in excess of six thousand meters in case you are going to use WGS84, which renders irrelevant which of the above cases you wish to consider. That was the reason for which I wrote in my answer to Spectrar Ghost that we have to change our geodedic systems.\n\nFor Rory: The spinning of Earth reason regarding the Mississippi was taken from this thread, maybe it was my poor understanding... anyway, you said that the Mississippi mouth beeing 1475 feet below its source is the reason and I cannot but agreed.

On Earth, we measure altitudes relative to mean sea level. And the whole point of that is that the sea finds its own level: namely, it settles to the configuration where it has the lowest potential energy. (Minor fluctuations due to tides and atmospheric pressure patterns aside.)\n\nSo effectively you can treat sea level as being a \"lowest energy surface\" that water will flow down towards. That's what \"down\" means: travelling from higher potential energy to lower potential energy.\n\nIf the globe was a stationary ball of uniform density then sea level would form a perfect sphere, because the only force would be gravity. However, because it rotates, the centripetal centrifugal force (which is highest at the equator) offsets a small fraction of the gravitational force, resulting in sea level bulging outwards a little at the equator. But sea level still represents the lowest energy surface, so anything above sea level is still \"uphill\" from it.\n\nThe distance from the centre of the Earth is irrelevant: what matters is the distance above sea level - or, more precisely, above the \"geoid\", which is the surface of equal potential energy, taking into account gravity, centrifugal force and variations in density. The source of the Mississippi at Lake Itasca is about 1,500ft above sea level, so clearly the river will flow downwards to the sea.\n\nTrying to separate out the gravitational and centripetal components is not really helpful. All that matters is where you are relative to sea level, because the sea does the work of finding the \"lowest energy\" shape for you.\n\nClick to expand...\n\nThe distance from the center of the Earth cannot be irrelevant because the ocean cannot be below its own floor, which floor is included in r1, where r1 is the Earth radii at the mouth of Mississippi latitude. The \"lowest energy surface\" about which you wrote is above ocean floor and ocean floor is above Itasca lake in our geodedic systems, including WGS84. I do not have enough altitude at the r2, where r2 is the Earth radii at the Itasca lake latitude, in order to make r1-r2 difference a negative number.\n\nThe distance from the center of the Earth cannot be irrelevant because the ocean cannot be below its own floor, which floor is included in r1, where r1 is the Earth radii at the mouth of Mississippi latitude.

All relevant explanations are in the thread already, so maybe having another read through may clear things up."
