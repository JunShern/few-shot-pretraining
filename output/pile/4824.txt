    "text": "At Steve Peace's suggestion, I had a conversation with Senator Jim\nBrulte, Senate Minority Leader, about the energy situation in Ca.  He\nmade the following points:\n\n1.  He and most others believe \"there is some funny stuff going on\" in\nthe market.\n\n2.  If generators are gaming the market, Rosenfield's initiative will\nensure that there is public power.\n\n3.  The only thing Gov. Davis knows for sure at this point is that we\nhave to have long term contracts, which will pass early in the session.\n\n4.  PG&E went to the marketplace to cover its short term debt and 40\nbanks turned them down.  He thinks there is a good chance the utilities\nwill ask for bankruptcy protection.\n\n5.  He's not interested in calling Ken Lay and/or Pres. Bush (he is\nclose to Bush himself) to have the Feds stabilize the market.  He thinks\nPeace's idea is to deflect criticism of Gov. Davis and place Bush and\nthe Republicans on the hot seat.\n\n6.  He thinks almost every problem with the Ca. market is the result of\na bad PUC decision and that we'll go to a public power authority and\ncondemn all plants if the problem doesn't correct soon.    Peace's $2\nbillion placeholder in the budget could be used for this purpose.\n\n7.  He thinks preferential buying of surplus power should be given to\nthe companies which contually sell power into Ca.\n\n8.  To the extent the market can be saved, the Legislature's job is to\nprovide a level playing field."
