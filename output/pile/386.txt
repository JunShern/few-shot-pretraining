I\u2019ve been looking forward to Starbound since it was first announced and modding since the beta release, creating mods such as Sparkz and Starfoundry and helping new modders to learn about the game\u2019s inner workings. Now, I\u2019m very excited to be joining the Chucklefish team, where I can put my experience to use making Starbound better for everyone!\n\nMy first major task will be overhauling the monster AI system and helping Tiy and the others to add new monster attacks and behaviors, new unique monsters, and of course new bosses. The new \u201cpartparameters\u201d configuration format that I added last week was the first step, making it easier for us to give monsters special attacks and skills that fit their visual appearance. Now, I\u2019m changing the way that monsters select attacks to use, allowing them to have a variety of abilities for different situations. The Starbound universe is going to get a lot more dangerous in all the right ways!\n\nIn addition to general AI improvements, I\u2019ve read through all the great suggestions for attacks and behaviors you\u2019ve posted, and have a TON of ideas that I can\u2019t wait to implement. I\u2019ll also be helping to expand the Lua API and improve documentation for modders, adding more interactive objects, and hopefully even fulfilling a few of my own wishes for the game.\n\nThe future of Starbound is bright. Let\u2019s explore it together!"
