    "text": "I remember when I received my first Wacom tablet in the mail. I was filled with pure excitement to finally interpret my doodles directly on screen. The brush tool in both Illustrator and Photoshop immediately became my favorite thing. Since then, I\u2019ve used the tablet to create lettering professionally, edit detailed photography, and apply a hand drawn feel to other projects. As a designer, you typically think \u2018expensive\u2019 when you hear the word Wacom. Maybe because they\u2019re known to be the best brand of tablets for designers that money can buy, but you\u2019d be surprised to find out an affordable Wacom is within reach! So, if you\u2019ve never owned a tablet before and you\u2019ve always wanted to draw, edit or doodle on screen, it can be done for less than $100. Seriously!\n\nHere are 5 affordable Wacom tablets:\n\n\n\n1. Wacom Intuos3 4\u00d75 Pen Tablet, PTZ430\n\nThis is the new version of the first tablet I ever owned! And it\u2019s wayyy less than I paid back in the day! I never used the mouse or the preset buttons (on the tablet or on the stylus), but it was my trusty side kick for close to 8 years. The only thing I didn\u2019t like (mentioned in #4 below) was that the surface the stylus is used on is hard plastic vs some of the softer surface options available on Wacoms.\n\n2. Wacom Intuos Pen and Touch Small Tablet\n\nThough I personally haven\u2019t used this tablet, the people on Amazon have spoken. 4.5 stars from 1500 reviewers and the best seller for its category can be pretty persuasive. This one looks like a great deal for anyone new to using a tablet.\n\n3. Wacom Bamboo Splash Pen Tablet CTL471\n\nMy coworker from my first job out of college used this tablet. It got him through 4 years of college and he was still going strong well into his professional career. I had asked him about it once and he said he had no reason to ever look for another. Pretty great reviews from other users, too!\n\n4. Wacom Intuos Pro Pen and Touch Small Tablet PTH451\n\nThis is my current tablet that I use at home for everything I do, including some of the tutorials you may have seen on my YouTube channel. I\u2019ve been really happy with it and don\u2019t plan to replace it any time soon. How this compares to the first tablet I owned (#1 above): The surface your stylus glides over on #1 always seemed a little \u2018plasticy\u2019 to me \u2013 with this tablet, the surface is much softer, more like paper. That\u2019s probably one of my favorite things about this tablet. Everything feels more natural when your stylus glides along vs \u2018slides\u2019 along \ud83d\ude42\n\n5. Wacom Intuos Pro Pen and Touch Large Tablet PTH851\n\nThis is the tablet I use at work, which is actually just the large version of the one I use at home (#4). I love, loveeee using this one at work for a few reasons. 1. It has a massive live area for drawing (I place my keyboard on top of it to maximize desk space when I\u2019m not using it, so I don\u2019t have to find a separate place to store it like my one at home) 2. there are many more pressure sensitivity settings for the stylus and 3. my favorite \u2013 it\u2019s also touch sensitive. So you can zoom in and out and rotate using your fingers just like on an iphone. Check out the video on the sales page to see \ud83d\ude42 If I ever decide to upgrade from my home version, this will likely be the one I get.\n\nThere you go! If you have any questions about using a Wacom for the first time or are curious about any features I did or didn\u2019t mention, feel free to leave a comment or send me an email, I\u2019m happy to answer any! Happy doodling \ud83d\ude42\n\n\n\n"
