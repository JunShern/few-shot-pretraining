    "text": "The new year is upon us. How many of you have promised yourself that 2014 will be different? It will be YOUR year. This is the year you will MAKE things happen!\n\nYou chose a nutrition or \u201cdiet\u201d plan to follow. You joined a gym or bought exercise equipment. This is going to be the year you get in the best shape of your life \u2013 you just know it. It is going to be different this time.\n\nI hate to be the bearer of bad news, but the odds are not in your favor.\n\nOut of the 45% of us who make resolutions, only 8% of us are successful in reaching our goals.\n\nThat\u2019s a disheartening statistic. Should we just give up on making resolutions, then?\n\nAbsolutely not! Studies show that the success rate of people who make resolutions is 10 times higher than the success rate of those desiring to change behavior but not making a resolution to do it.\n\nAnswering a few questions about goals and human behavior can help provide insight and guidance on how to make effective resolutions and make this year different.\n\nWhy do so many of us fail, year after year, at reaching our goals? And what do those of us who succeed do differently? Why are we so motivated when we first set those goals and then lose steam and completely give up?\n\nFirst, let\u2019s start with WHY we make resolutions in the first place.\n\nTimothy Pychyl, a professor of psychology at Carleton University in Canada, says that resolutions are a form of \u201ccultural procrastination,\u201d an effort to reinvent oneself, and people make resolutions as a way of motivating themselves.\n\nMost of us want to improve at least one aspect of our lives, and the new year seems like a great time to do it. It gives us a symbolic clean slate.\n\nSo why do so many of us fail? Experts say that people usually aren\u2019t willing to change their habits \u2013 especially the bad ones.\n\nSetting unrealistic goals and expectations is another obstacle:\n\nPsychology professor Peter Herman and his colleagues have identified what they call the \u201cfalse hope syndrome,\u201d which means their resolution is significantly unrealistic and out of alignment with their internal view of themselves.\n\nIn other words, be honest about yourself about your abilities and where you are starting from. Don\u2019t expect to go from sitting around the house all day to being a marathoner in a few months, or to lose 40 pounds in a few weeks. There is nothing wrong with having big goals, but be realistic about the time and effort you will have to invest to get there.\n\nClinical psychologist John Norcross says that setting obtainable and realistic goals is crucial, but the goal also has to be measurable:\n\nWe say if you can\u2019t measure it, it\u2019s not a very good resolution because vague goals beget vague resolutions. Grandiose goals beget resignation and early failure.\n\nSetting realistic, attainable, and measurable goals is the first step, but that\u2019s the easy part. Anyone can sit down and plan out what and how they plan to change a habit or reach a goal. The next step \u2013 and the most important \u2013 takes some more work. It involves your MINDSET. In order to change the behaviors that will help you reach your goals, you need to change the way you THINK.\n\nNothing happens in your reality without it first happening in your mind. Where the mind goes, the body follows. Your personal world is the result of your inner thinking. Therefore, happiness, health, and weight loss are the result\u2026or not.\n\nSo how do you change your mindset?\n\nBelief. You have to believe that you are capable of achieving your goals.\n\nAll of your life experiences have shaped who you THINK you are and what you BELIEVE you can accomplish.\n\nMany years ago, I noticed something unpleasant about myself. I\u2019ve also observed this trait in other people. You might recognize it in yourself.\n\nI tend to get in my own way. I start working towards a goal, and I get excited about the progress I begin to see. Success finally seems within my reach, and then\u2026something happens. I lose my motivation and go back to my old ways. This drives me crazy, so I started doing some research to find out WHY I do this to myself. During that process, I came across an intriguing article. I still haven\u2019t forgotten its message, and still refer back to it when I feel myself slipping. And, I still actively study the concepts I learned from it.\n\nThe article is called Self Concept and Self Sabotage: The Hidden Reason Why You Sabotage Your Diet and Fitness Efforts Just When the Going Gets Good (and What to Do About It).\n\nIt was written by Tom Venuto, who is a very well-known and respected fitness expert.\n\nHere\u2019s an excerpt:\n\nTell me if this has ever happened to you: You decide you want to improve your body and live a healthier lifestyle. You read all the books, gather all the information, map out a nutritional strategy, design your own workout schedule (or have a trainer do it for you), and you embark on the journey to a leaner physique\u2026and it starts working! But the minute you begin getting results, you fall off the wagon. You binge, you skip workouts, you cheat.\n\nWhat\u2019s most perplexing (and upsetting) is that you know what you should do\u2026 but no matter how hard you try, you can\u2019t get yourself to do it! It\u2019s as if some unseen force is sabotaging you and controlling your behavior like you were a puppet on a string.\n\nHmm\u2026sound familiar?\n\nHe goes on:\n\nYou may not understand or appreciate this \u201cself concept\u201d and \u201cself image\u201d stuff yet.\n\nHowever, if you choose to ignore this information, you would be making a grave error.\n\nYou can be on the most perfect nutrition program and the best training routine in the world, but you\u2019ll always sabotage yourself in the long run if you don\u2019t understand what your self image is, how it controls your behavior, and how to change it.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s talk about your SELF-CONCEPT: This is the total bundle of beliefs you have about yourself, including all the names and labels you put on yourself and the way you see yourself. If you really want to know what your true self-concept is, write down the words \u201cI AM ______________\u201d and fill in the blanks with everything you can think of. \u201d\n\nWhat beliefs do YOU hold about yourself? How do you label yourself?\n\nMake a list. Be honest \u2013 write down words and phrases you think describe yourself.Now, look over your list.\n\nThe words and phrases you wrote are good indicators of your self-concept.\n\nYour self-concept started forming in early childhood. Your parents, your peers, and authority figures largely influenced its development. All of the information and suggestions you gathered from those sources was stored in your subconscious mind \u2013 and were accepted as true, even if they weren\u2019t.\n\nVenuto continues:\n\nAs an adult, your self-concept has solidified, but it slowly continues to be molded and reinforced by your successes, failures, triumphs, humiliations and everything you experience, see, hear, read and think. For example, if you go on a diet or exercise program and you fail, this goes into your subconscious memory bank and reinforces a negative self-concept: \u2018See, I told you I\u2019ll never be able to look like those people in the magazines.\u2019\n\nVenuto uses this analogy to explain self-concept:\n\nAlthough your self-concept is deeply entrenched from years of conditioning, it CAN be changed. Before I explain the four steps to making the change, I want to explain self-concept using an analogy everyone can relate to \u2013 MONEY!\n\nMoney is seldom a subject that bores anyone and it\u2019s a common denominator between all people, so let me explain the relationship between money and self-concept first. Once you see how self-concept affects how much money you earn, you\u2019ll easily understand how it affects what kind of shape you\u2019re in. You\u2019ll then have enough awareness to begin changing your self-concept \u2013 and your body \u2013 for the better.\n\nQuestion: If you won a large sum of money, or if your annual income suddenly became your monthly income, how would you feel about it?\n\n\u2018That would be AWESOME!\u2019 is what most people blurt out initially. I have news for you: As bizarre as this may sound, I guarantee that if your old self-concept was still locked in place, you\u2019d do everything possible to get rid of your new-found wealth. You\u2019d make bad business decisions. You\u2019d be unsuccessful in sales. You\u2019d have an uncontrollable urge to go out and spend the money, splurge on things you didn\u2019t need, invest in things you knew nothing about, lend to people who wouldn\u2019t give it back or even flat out lose it! Just look at what happens to most lottery winners.\n\nEven though everyone SAYS they\u2019d like more money, that\u2019s only on the conscious, surface level. The problem is, your behavior is NOT controlled by your conscious mind; your behavior is controlled on a deeper level \u2013 from your subconscious mind where your self-concept is located. If having a lot of money isn\u2019t consistent with your self-concept, it will sooner or later lead to some form of sabotaging behavior to bring you back down to your comfort level.\n\nMost people stay inside a comfort zone that\u2019s consistent with the concept and image they hold of themselves. They rarely rise above it or allow themselves to fall below it. Any time you try to make a change in your life, whether it\u2019s losing fat or earning more money, it will stir up resistance inside you because you\u2019re attempting to move beyond the safe, familiar and comfortable.\n\nTo earn more money, you must see yourself as capable of earning more money and worthy of keeping it. If you see yourself as a $24,000 per YEAR person, you\u2019ll NEVER earn and keep $24,000 per MONTH unless you see yourself as a $24,000 per month person.\n\nAre you starting to see how self-concept \u2013 your beliefs about yourself \u2013 will help you change your mindset and succeed?\n\nYou must begin to see yourself as the person you want to be. Believe that you are capable.\n\nYour self-image must change.\n\nVenuto explains this concept:\n\nThe part of the self-concept that affects your physical condition and ability to achieve your perfect weight is called the SELF-IMAGE. Maxwell Maltz, a plastic surgeon and author of the best seller, Psycho Cybernetics, stumbled onto the discovery of self-image with his patients. Even though he had corrected physical defects and deformities with surgery, his patients often retained their old self-image and continued to see themselves as \u201cugly,\u201d \u201cscarred,\u201d or \u201cdeformed\u201d even though they appeared quite beautiful by society\u2019s standards. As a result, they continued to behave as they always had; shy, retiring, lacking in confidence.\n\nThis led Dr. Maltz to the conclusion that changing the physical image was not the real key to changes in personality and behavior. There was \u201csomething else.\u201d That something else is the self-image. When the self-image is \u201creconstructed,\u201d the person changes. If the self-image stays the same, the person\u2019s behavior stays the same.\n\nFocusing solely on following a \u201cdiet\u201d plan or workout program without having the right mindset is setting yourself up for failure because you are not addressing the SOURCE of the behavior.\n\nThe source of your behavior is your mental self-image. You are more than just a body. You are a body, a mind and a spirit. You will always act \u2013 and can ONLY act \u2013 like the type of person you SEE yourself to be in your mind.\n\nVenuto elaborates on how this works:\n\nIf you see yourself as a fat person, you will behave like a fat person. If you see yourself as a lean, fit and healthy person, you will behave like a lean, fit and healthy person. A fat person would never work out faithfully every day of the week, so why is it any surprise that someone with a \u201cfat person\u201d self-image would skip workouts? Their brain is programmed to skip workouts. Someone with a \u201cfat person\u201d self-image would never eat healthy, low fat, low sugar, low calorie meals, so why would it be surprising that they cheat on their diet and binge on junk food? After all, their brain is programmed to eat junk. Is this starting to make sense?\n\nTo make a lasting change, you must work on the physical AND the mental planes. Of course you have to change your lifestyle, exercise and nutrition habits, but the real secret is not trying to force new behaviors, but changing the self-image which controls the behavior. Put your energy on a new mental picture, and the new picture will create new behaviors. Best of all, the new behaviors that spring from a positive new self-image will come without as much effort or willpower because they\u2019re hard-wired into every cell of your body. The \u201cunseen forces\u201d are now working for you instead of against you.\n\nMakes sense, doesn\u2019t it?\n\nSo, how do you change your self-concept?\n\nYou create your desired self-image \u2013 picture it in your mind. Make it vivid and detailed. Dream, fantasize, imagine it \u2013 make it clear in your mind. Don\u2019t just think about what you believe you CAN get \u2013 think about what you WANT.\n\nNow, write that detailed description down on a card or paper you can carry with you in your purse, wallet, or pocket. Venuto says, \u201cWhen you write your goal, use the three Ps: POSITIVE (what you want to achieve, not what you want to avoid or get rid of), PERSONAL (use the word I) and PRESENT tense (an already-having-received attitude). Don\u2019t worry if it\u2019s not perfect. Just sit down and write, write, write. You can always go back and edit, change or update it later. Just start.\u201d\n\nNow you are ready to \u201cfake it til you make it\u201d. I\u2019m not telling you to be phony or put on an act. I\u2019m telling you to BECOME the part you\u2019ve written. Live it. Step into your new role. Take actions that are consistent with your new self. Do something every day that gets you closer to your goal.\n\nReinforce your new self-image daily \u2013 even hourly. Repetition will help you reprogram your mind by replacing the old image with the new one. It took a long time for your original self-image to form, so don\u2019t expect the new one to take hold immediately. It will take time, effort, and consistency.\n\nYour self image serves as the operating instructions of your mind and it controls everything you say, do, think and feel. In the absence of any deliberate change on your part, you will continue doing, thinking, saying and feeling very much the same things indefinitely.\n\nYou must change your mind to change your life.\n\nLily Dane is a staff writer for The Daily Sheeple, where this first appeared.
