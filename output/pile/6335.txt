It's interesting how big Pandora's following is, and how this\nwill change over time as awareness for the newer services builds among the\ngeneral population.\n\nIt will also be interesting to see a trend comparison of pure internet radio\nplatforms, like Pandora and Songza.\n\n~~~\nmarcadam\nYep - the thing about these numbers are that they're obviously based on\n_registered_ users, not active users. For example, which Spotify may have 33\nmillion users, only 20 million of those are active. Pandora may have an\nimpressive 150 million registered users, but I imagine the drop off rate of\nactive users is relatively high given the increase in popularity of other\nservices.\n\n~~~\nquahada\nyeah, and with these streaming services there's also free vs paid users.\n\nAnd Pandora is not profitable. I believe Pandora loses money with each user-\nhour, which means more users == more losses.\n\n"
