    "text": "Podcast Review: \u201cThe Right Time with Bomani Jones\u201d\n\nAfter a far too long hiatus The Right Time with Bomani Jones returns as a podcast that will post a couple of times a week according to the host. Bomani is a wickedly smart guy whose life experiences and cultural background could not be more different than my own and while his take may be one you\u2019ve heard I suspect the path he guides you to that point will be different than other voices on ESPN.\n\nSurprisingly Bomani didn\u2019t mention his upcoming ESPN TV show with Pablo Torre, offer any updates on the status of that project or discuss his three-month hiatus.\n\nInstead, he jumped right into the sports news, talking about the win by Villanova and had a bit of fun talking about the game\u2019s star player whom he dubbed #whitedonte. Bomani shoved aside the developing controversy over the Twitter comments by the star, saying \u201cI\u2019m not getting mad at you for what you said at 14\u201d And I have to agree that it is troubling pattern that as soon as someone gets a bit of spotlight people dig through their Twitter history seemingly in an effort to destroy them. Along with his show producer, Gabe, they went on to discuss how good life can be right now for Donte walking around campus today.\n\nBomani\u2019s unique upbringing shined in his analysis of the Jim Mora\u2019s comments on Josh Rosen that are burning up sports talk currently. While most of the talking heads I\u2019ve heard are directly engaging the slight of \u201cmillennials,\u201d Bomani moves beyond that generational \u201cget off my lawn\u201d talk into Rosen\u2019s background and how that can play into certain biases saying, \u201cHe\u2019s going to need to find a way to make people feel good about how smart he is.\u201d\n\nAs is often the case with Bomani, various references led me to \u201cGoogle it.\u201d Today it was a current news item about RZA and the WuTang Clan (Bomani has an amazing knowledge of music history), Dave Chappelle\u2019s \u201cRacial Draft\u201d skit and rediscovered Tiger Woods\u2019 given name is Eldrick. I had to smile when he found that lower register close to the mic, and with a wink in his voice talked about the \u201cout of the town\u201d weekend and moments later compared Tiger Woods role in golf popularity to Bob Marley and reggae, \u201cNot many who really like Reggae but love Bob Marley.\u201d\n\nBut it was Bomani\u2019s rants on self-driving cars and self-checkout that found me nodding my head in full agreement. These were found in a segment \u201cIf You Haven\u2019t Heard\u201d, three non-sports articles that were introduced by the journalists who wrote them.\n\nWith today\u2019s podcast, I was very happy to see the return of his segment \u201cWhy I Quit Football.\u201d Among today\u2019s reports was Neil in El Paso who back in the sixth grade suited up, but after he got hit so hard his facemask got stuck under a chain length fence, he took off the gear and never went back. Neil figures the helmet is still there. Sometimes the stories are like this where kids discover the realities of the physical toll of football while other times it is older men realizing that the clock has expired on their time on the field.\n\nSometime in the next few weeks, ESPN is expected to premiere an afternoon show featuring Bomani Jones and Pablo Torre \u2014 a fascinating pairing: two highly educated, well-spoken individuals who are not afraid to demonstrate their broad knowledge base and expansive vocabulary. They definitely don\u2019t reflect the barstool debate or average joe dialogue that dominated sports talk previously and hopefully will have a chance find their rhythm within the new show. Until then, I suspect that, along with this regular podcast, Bomani and Pablo will continue to pop-up on various ESPN programming such The Dan Le Batard Show with Stugotz and Around the Horn.\n\nThe Right Time with Bomani Jones is available on ESPN.com, iTunes, and other various podcast outlets."
