    "text": "Sonic Riders is on all 3 consoles (Xbox PS2 and GCN)\nBut I think It will do best on and.. is deffinitly needed more on GC so I post it here.\n\nSonic Riders Hands-On\nWhat happens when the world's fastest hedgehog gets outrun by a hoverboard? Well, if you can't beat 'em...\nSonic the Hedgehog is one of the oldest non-Nintendo game mascots still kicking, having been created way back in 1990 for the Genesis. Over the years, he and his cast of teammates have starred in a number of different types of games, including side-scrollers, fighting games, party games, and even a pinball game. In Sonic Riders, the blue-haired hedgehog tackles a multitude of gameplay styles including snowboarding, skateboarding, and racing.\n\nRiding in turbulence streams gives you a huge speed boost.\nYou'll be forgiven if you need to read through that again: Sonic Riders definitely sports a pretty bizarre mixture of influences. Overall, the game plays as something of a mixture between an SSX-style snowboarding game--complete with jumping tricks and railgrinds--and a Hydro Thunder-esque arcade racer. It's certainly a unique experience and is looking like it might be worth checking out, if you're into arcade-style racing games. We had a chance to sit down with a build of the game recently and took away these impressions.\n\nThe plot of the game begins with Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles hanging around in Metal City, where they witness a chaos emerald being stolen by a mysterious trio of thieves known only as the Babylon Rogues. To retrieve the emerald, Sonic and company agree to go head-to-head with the Babylon Rogues in the Ex World Grand Prix, a racing tournament set up by none other than Dr. Eggman. For what it's worth, the game does a good job of integrating the plot into the heroes mode, which intersperses cutscenes between the races and sets up the rivalries between the two trios of characters.\n\nAs far as the racing goes, there are many aspects of Sonic Riders that set it apart from the pack, not the least of these being the inclusion of different classes for the characters. Each character is assigned to one of three categories: speed, air, or power. Racers of different categories will experience the race and interact with the course in fundamentally different ways. Speed characters, such as Sonic, are capable of jumping their airboard onto rails and grinding for an extra speed boost, while air characters, like Tails, can jump into accelerators suspended in midair to propel forward. Power characters don't get any special movement powers, but can instead knock aside obstacles that would normally trip up other characters, and they can even knock through weak sections of the walls to reveal shortcuts.\n\nAnyone looking for a madcap racing game will probably want to take a look at Sonic Riders.\nOne of the interesting aspects about this system is that you'll really have to know the various courses in order to take advantage of the movement system that's available to your character; it's very difficult to hit all of the accelerators, rails, or shortcuts that are available to your character on your first trip around a track (though there are signs for each kind of shortcut scattered around the track, pointing out their presence). When you learn their positions, though, you'll be able to take better advantage of them; but even if you know where all the spots are, it's still tricky to use them. For instance, when grinding a rail, you can't just sit on a single rail and grind your way through; you often have to jump between numerous smaller rails. The same goes for airborne accelerators--you have to maneuver through multiple accelerators to complete your speed boost. Failing to complete an entire set of rails or accelerators will send you plummeting back to the track, or on some levels, dropping off into empty space, which will reset your position and cause you to lose a lot of time.\n\nThe reason you want to take a chance on these risky maneuvers is that they'll add to your air tank. Your air tank in Sonic Riders is somewhat like the boost meter in a game like SSX--you can use it to go faster when needed, or even attack your opponents, but it will run down when you attempt to speed up or make a sharp corner. You'll be forced to constantly recharge it, either by performing your maneuvers or by jumping into one of the air pits that are scattered around the tracks (which gradually fill up your tank at the cost of keeping you immobilized).\n\nYou can also increase your air tank by attempting to perform tricks during jumps. When you approach a jump, you have to hold down your jump button while approaching it. As is standard, the longer you hold the button down, the higher you'll eventually jump, but if you hold it down too long, your speed will be sapped. If you jump with the right timing, you'll rocket into the air and have a chance to perform your tricks. Tricking out isn't as complicated as it might seem, since everything is controlled by pressing directions on the left analog stick. The more tricks you pull off during a jump, the bigger the charge you'll receive to your air tank when you land. You're also ranked on the strength of your landing, so if you happen to try too many tricks, you'll hit the ground awkwardly and take a big speed penalty.\n\nTaking advantage of your character's special abilities will be key to winning races.\nLastly, one of the cooler aspects of Sonic Riders is the inclusion of turbulence. When a character starts to move especially fast, he or she will leave a tunnel of turbulence behind. If other characters hop into the tunnel (which acts essentially like a long halfpipe), they'll be able to ride inside the turbulence instead of on the track itself. There are some huge advantages to riding inside turbulence, such as the fact that it's much easier to make sharp turns while you're in the pipe. You also get a fairly large speed boost, allowing you to eventually catch up to and overtake the character that started the turbulence. If you're skillful, you can even jump up out of turbulence, do a few tricks, then land back inside the air trail to gain an even greater speed boost.\n\nOne of the high points of Sonic Riders at this point is the graphics. Everything looks very sharp, with a bright color palette and a good sense of speed, especially when you're sliding through a turbulence pipe. The drawbacks include a limited number of tracks (only five are initially selectable, although we're hoping more are unlockable) and that there's apparently no way to turn off the somewhat grating announcer's voice.\n\nSonic Riders is currently on point for release in late February, so check back with GameSpot for a full review when it hits store shelves.\n\nPrint this StoryBy Matthew Rorie\n\nhttp://www.gamespot.com/ps2/driving/sonicriders/news.html?sid=6143182\n\nA few points worth knowing that they didnt say is:\n\n1)When you collect Rings in the level they level up your attack power\n\n2)Rings also act as money you can buy new boards and equiptment\neven Skates and A hover bike.\n\n3)There are 17 Characters to choose from.\n\n4)When someone is rideing your terbulance you can alternate it so that\nthey get sent flying off corse if they hit it.\n\nNem\n\n01-29-2006, 09:00 PM\n\nsounds fun.

To me any game franchise that used to be exclusive and goes multi-platform makes it feel like a cheap game to rake in money.\nPlease let the chaotix team die. seeing them in Sonic Heros made me sick.\nWell I know what you mean in a way, I normally just asume that a game\nthat goes multiplatform is going to suck but thats not usually always the case.\nThe thing is with Sonic is that he is such a popular Character when one\nconsole gets a sonic game and the others dont everyone crys and bitches.\n\nNotice what happened when Sonic the Hedgehog was announced only\nfor Xbox360 and everyone made a big fuss.. Expically the Nintendo croud\neven though they very well know no Revolution games have been announced yet.\n\nSeraph\n\n01-30-2006, 11:37 AM\n\nSince Sonic dosent have a home anymore, I think he should stay at Nintendos house.\n\nSeeing him go to Sony or Microsoft would just feel wrong. If he has to go someplace, Nintendo is the best home hes got.\n\nsharky~\n\n01-30-2006, 12:04 PM\n\nI would have agreed if the Revolution was different.\nI cant say Im a graphics whore but I would like Sonic games to have as awesome\ngraphics as possable. I also have a feeling that the Revolution controller\nwill get pretty old fast.\nAt first there will be a hole host of interesting new games for it\nBut it WILL be a bit of a gimmick in the end.\n\nAll developers will automaticlly asume they need to make wacky games based around\nthe controller and I would much prefer a Sonic game that ISNT based around the Revolution Contoller.\n\nBut as for handhelds I agree Sonic on DS all the way.\n\nSeraph\n\n01-30-2006, 12:39 PM\n\nI cant say Im a graphics whore but I would like Sonic games to have as awesome graphics as possable.Look at Sonic 1-3 on the genesis, MarioWorld 1 and 2 beat the crap out of them visually. Graphics arent really a concern with me when it comes to sonic games. As long as it goes fast im happy.I also have a feeling that the Revolution controller\nwill get pretty old fast.I think everyones just a bit worried. Kind of like the DS. Yet it took Nintendo to show us how their gimmick could be done right, and look at the DS now.\n\nHave faith in sonics new home sharky!\n\ncamac\n\n01-30-2006, 03:00 PM\n\nLook at Sonic 1-3 on the genesis, MarioWorld 1 and 2 beat the crap out of them visually. Graphics arent really a concern with me when it comes to sonic games.\n\nI disagree completely.\nAnd also about Sonic's new home being Nintendo... also disagree, so the first 2 sonic adventure remakes were on the Gamecube exclusively.. then the next two are multiplatform? I'm just speaking out of my ass here since I don't know the numbers, but I'd assume when a company does something like this it'd probably be because it wasn't selling as much as they had hoped on their first choice. Kinda like RE4. Sonic would do just fine on PS2.. though can't say the same about Xbox... it feels like they let Jet Set Radio die. bleh. I want more Jet Set Radio.\n\nAlexander\n\n01-30-2006, 07:47 PM\n\nSpeaking of Jet Set Radio...I just bought it for Xbox and it doesn't work on 360. I thought everyone had that game at one point; it has to be a best seller!\n\nFor this game...well, I have a feeling it will be a lot like F-Zero for the Gamecube. I liked that one a lot, so here's hoping it will be.\n\nJoe Redifer\n\n01-30-2006, 08:57 PM\n\nLook at Sonic 1-3 on the genesis, MarioWorld 1 and 2 beat the crap out of them visually.\nUh, no. Not even close. Although certainly some argument can be made for Yoshi's Island (that's Marioworld 2, right?) I've seen Sega Master System games that look similar to Super Mario World 1. Mario World is an AWESOME game however. I do not consider Yoshi's Island a Mario game proper. It should not be called Mario World 2.\n\nNem\n\n01-30-2006, 09:35 PM\n\nPlease let the chaotix team die. seeing them in Sonic Heros made me sick.\n\nOh, stop whining already!\nA ninja chamelion is cool!
