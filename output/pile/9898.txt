( Supplied: Hassell )\n\nLabor is also promising to complete the third and final stage of the Geelong Performing Arts Centre's redevelopment at a cost of $128 million.\n\nThis would include a 500-seat drama theatre, 250-seat courtyard theatre, another smaller performance space, an outdoor atrium, more dining options, an upgraded box office and refurbished back-of-house and administration facilities.\n\nThe project would cover about two thirds of the site, with most of the work focussing on the Little Malop Street side of the building.\n\nWork on the arts centre would start in 2020 and be completed by 2023.\n\nThe Government says that project would create about 600 construction jobs and more than 300 ongoing local jobs in the tourism and service industries.\n\nWork is currently underway on the on the $38.5-million second stage of the centre's redevelopment, including a new foyer, bar area and four rehearsal studios.\n\n\"This is all about providing the best facilities so that we can have more shows and a more diverse program of events,\" Mr Andrews said.\n\n\"We will have, when this work is finished, not only the best stadium in regional Australia but the best performing arts centre anywhere in regional Australia as well.\"\n\nLabor will be hoping the announcement helps its chances of wresting the seat of South Barwon from Liberal MP Andrew Katos, who holds it on a margin of less than 3 per cent.\n\nThe seat, which includes areas south and west of Geelong's city centre including Highton, Moriac, Waurn Ponds and Torquay, was held by Labor from 2002 to 2010.\n\nIts candidate is former federal MP Darren Cheeseman.\n\nLabor will also be seeking to strengthen its hold on the seats of Bellarine, which Police Minister Lisa Neville holds on a margin of 4.8 per cent, and Geelong, which Christine Couzens holds on a margin of 6 per cent.\n\nLabor introduced the grand final eve holiday in 2015. ( AAP: Julian Smith )\n\nGuy drops opposition to holiday\n\nThe pitch for football fan votes comes as Opposition Leader Matthew Guy ends the Coalition's three-year criticism of Victoria's grand final eve public holiday.\n\nThe Opposition and business groups have consistently attacked the holiday since was introduced by the Andrews Government in 2015.\n\nIn 2016, Mr Guy said that the grand final eve holiday was not something his team was \"looking at keeping\" if elected.\n\n\"It has got a lot of small businesses and their families offside \u2026 and [is] losing a lot of money,\" he said at the time.\n\nBut Mr Guy told the Herald Sun that the holiday would remain if he won the election.\n\n\"We didn't originally support it but we accept it's now part of the calendar,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't think Victorians want public holidays to be politicised so we will leave the grand final holiday as it is.\"\n\nIn 2015, a Government-commissioned report by PriceWaterhouseCoopers found that the holiday would cost the Victorian economy up to $852 million a year in lost production."
