If I search on it, I get all instances where \"removeEventListener\" is used and of course that is not helpful.\nI have searched on the web but only come up with similarly unhelpful false hits (how ironic).\nIt appears I can use regex but I don't know how to do that and trying this answer to a regex question was no help\n\nA:\n\nEnable the regular expression option and then use the below regex.\n\\bremoveEvent\\b\n\n\\b called word boundary which helps to do an exact match.. \\b matches between a word charcater and non-word character, vice-versa..\n\n"
