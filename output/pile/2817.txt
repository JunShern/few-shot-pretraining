    "text": "TL;DR \u2014 Red4Sec finished, more audits coming, and an update regarding mainnet\n\nRed4Sec, our auditor for the last 7 weeks, has completed their audit and submitted their report to QRL. Red4Sec consists of a talented team that has spent much of the past 2 months poring over our code 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. They were joined in parallel by our own team, also scouring our codebase for vulnerabilities and mishaps, as well as dealing with issues raised by Red4Sec as they came up.\n\nDuring the analysis, whose report runs over 200 pages, a total of 67 vulnerabilities were detected. Many of these vulnerabilities did not pose any risk by themselves and therefore have been classified as informative.\n\nAll vulnerabilities were classified according to the impact level defined by CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System): critical, high, medium, low and informative.\n\nA summary of the issues per project area is described below.\n\nWhat Red4Sec covered\n\nRed4Sec\u2019s report was exhaustive, and covered the entirety of our project space, with the exception of our Post Quantum Cryptography, which will be covered by a further audit as it\u2019s more specialized in nature. Below is a rundown of issues raised by Red4Sec by section of our network, as well as impact level.\n\nBlockchain\n\nQRL (Python)\n\nCritical : 6 issues identified \u2014 All fixed by end of audit\n\nHigh : 3 issues identified \u2014 All fixed by end of audit\n\nMedium : 4 issues identified \u2014 2 fixed by end of audit, outstanding fixes have now been applied (everything is fixed)\n\nLow/Informative : 21 issues or queries which have all been reviewed by the team, with changes made to the codebase where necessary.\n\n: 6 issues identified \u2014 All fixed by end of audit : 3 issues identified \u2014 All fixed by end of audit : 4 issues identified \u2014 2 fixed by end of audit, outstanding fixes have now been applied (everything is fixed) : 21 issues or queries which have all been reviewed by the team, with changes made to the codebase where necessary. Qryptonight (C++)\n\nCritical : 1 issue identified \u2014 fixed by end of audit\n\n: 1 issue identified \u2014 fixed by end of audit Qrllib (C++)\n\nInformative: 1 issue which was closed by the end of the audit.\n\nPublic facing Infrastructure\n\nQRL Wallet (JS)\n\nCritical : 1 issue identified \u2014 fixed by end of audit\n\nHigh : 1 issue identified as informative by Red4Sec \u2014 the team rated it as High, however, and it was fixed by the end of the audit\n\n: 1 issue identified \u2014 fixed by end of audit : 1 issue identified as informative by Red4Sec \u2014 the team rated it as High, however, and it was fixed by the end of the audit Block Explorer (JS)\n\nLow/Informative : 1 Low and 1 Informative level issue which were both closed by the end of the audit.\n\n: 1 Low and 1 Informative level issue which were both closed by the end of the audit. theqrl.org (JS)\n\nMedium: 1 issue identified \u2014 fixed by the end of audit\n\nBackend & Team processes\n\nInfrastructure includes nodes, cloud services, mail services and any other service that QRL relies upon for development and other team processes.\n\nMedium: 5 issues identified \u2014 all fixed by end of audit.\n\nLow/Informative: 11 issues have been identified and all have been fixed.\n\nSome words from Red4Sec:\n\nIn general terms, it has been detected that the design and logic of the project is well defined. The project code follows a methodology of safe programming and good practices. The project has great support from the team as some of the vulnerabilities have been resolved at the time they were detected by Red4Sec, mitigating the possible impact and repercussion that could cause to the project.\n\nThe whole QRL team thanks Red4Sec for their professionalism and attention to detail in improving the quality of our ecosystem.\n\nMore audits\n\nAs our codebase and ecosystem grows, it is important to continually appraise the security of our implementations.\n\nWe are, therefore, pleased to announce that we have signed an agreement with X41 D-Sec GmbH to undertake a secondary security audit in the coming months. This audit will be differently focused than the Red4Sec audit, leveraging some of the specific expertise at X41 such as covering the Post Quantum Cryptography portion of QRL.\n\nMainnet Progress Update\n\nIt has been a long ride to reach our main network, and our launch is just the beginning of the overall QRL journey.\n\nA date for the launch of the QRL main network has been finalized and will be announced in the coming days."
