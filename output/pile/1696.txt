    "text": "Category: tea\n\nI had been enjoying John King\u2019s Instagram feed when he posted the following summary of a new tea, a wild tree tea from the Bulang region in Menghai county.\n\n\u201cRegarding these wild tree, we still don\u2019t know how old they are.What it attracts me was the unique bitterness and soon coming Huigan (sweetness from aftertaste) and fell in love with it when I first tried it accidentally in Menghai.Always hard to find accurate description words on this bitterness.It is a wild, naughty flavor.\u201d\n\nI do really enjoy the way John describes his teas. It is slightly poetic, yet at the same time highly specific and descriptive.\n\nAs someone who enjoyed bitterness, (Broccoli Raab is one of my favorite vegetables, when I was drinking I imbibed copiously of the Amaro\u2026) I almost felt like he was daring me to try this tea!\n\nWho wouldn\u2019t want to try a tea with, \u201ca wild, naughty flavor\u201d?\n\nWhen I finally got around to ordering a cake of the tea he was describing, he said he would include some samples of others he thought I might like, given my interest in his Bitterly Wild and Naughty Tea.\n\nI suppose I should have considered myself warned.\n\nThis tea is a blend of tea leaves from Wild trees and Old trees from the BanPen (\u73ed\u76c6 which belongs to BanZhang tea area).\n\nThe opening flavors are quite bitter, they lead to middle flavors that are OK, but not amazing. Tobacco, Leather. Where this tea shines is in its outstanding and lengthy finish, camphor like flavors which seems to almost evaporate from your tongue. Oh, and it is one of those teas where you\u2019re a couple cups in, and realize that it is zippy. Very Zippy. Or as John says, \u201cStrong ChaQi makes mind clear and breath smooth and clear.\u201d\n\nIsn\u2019t something like that the Mental Mantra from Frank Herbert\u2019s \u201cDune\u201d?\n\nAs I mentioned before the Chinese region of Yunnan borders Vietnam, Laos, and Myanmar in a sort of indistinct mountainous area. Tea trees grow naturally in the neighboring areas of of all three countries.\n\nAs I understand it, John King, the proprietor of King Tea Mall tried some teas in small villages of Laos near Burma and became entranced with the potential of the tea trees there.\n\nUsually, when we say \u201ctea trees\u201d, calling them \u201ctrees\u201d is being generous. Most are kind of bushy and spindly, not getting much taller than a man. In commercial tea producing areas, it doesn\u2019t make much sense to let them get too big, it just makes them harder to harvest.\n\nIn these areas of Laos, some of these tea trees have been growing wild, apparently for years or decades.\n\nJohn has some great pictures of the workers climbing trees like squirrels to harvest the tender shoots and leaves of these enormous tea trees.\n\nI\u2019ll let him describe the tea.\n\n\u201cThat is a flavor I have never tasted before. Though there is near the south border of YI WU tea region in China, but the taste is far different. Also different from teas from other regions in Yunnan.\n\n\u201cEver the bitterness turns out in the beginning or sweetness which comes from aftertaste are obvious like a weather I experienced these days in that tea sourcing trip. The sun was shining brightly. Soon a group of cloud dropped by and brought a sudden rainfall. Meanwhile, the sun was still shining from higher sky. When the cloud passed by minutes later, sky turned back to normal as before.\n\nI can\u2019t do any better than that, but I will say the later steeps of this tea exhibit some great fruit flavors that I believe will only be enhanced as it ages.\n\nUsually, the term \u201cPuerh\u201d is reserved solely for tea made in Yunnan, China. Others can be called \u201cDark Tea\u201d, but they aren\u2019t Puerh.\n\nJohn brought in tea harvesters and processors from Yunnan, did the early stages of tea processing in Laos. Then moved the tea to Menhai, Yunnan, where the processing was completed. So, at the very least it is Laotian Tea processed in Puerh Style.\n\nI mentioned when I ordered a couple teas from Yin Xiang Hua Xia Tea, they sent along a few samples. One was this mysterious entity, marked only in Chinese characters.\n\nThe single serving Chicklet/Tile shape intrigued me, but I couldn\u2019t find anything very similar on their website.\n\nOpening the package, it seemed like a white tea of some sort.\n\nI sent a note off the the tea company asking what it was, but went ahead and brewed it at the slightly lower temps I use for white tea.\n\nWhen I tasted it, I was pretty sure it was a white tea, as it reminded me strongly of Fujianese Bai Mudan or White Peony type tea.\n\nIt was quite tasty and surprisingly zippy, with the typical tasting notes you\u2019d give a white tea. Light body, floral, yet earthy/minty flavors. Good length of aftertaste and a bit more re-steepability than you would expect from even a Bai Mudan.\n\nI did eventually hear back from the company and find out the tea is what they call Songya Mudan from 2012. Songya Mudan is a classification of Fujianese white tea with fewer buds than Bai Mudan.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the main classifications of white tea are based mostly on the ratio of buds to leaves, Silver Needle, White Peony, etc., and that they aren\u2019t exactly related to quality of the tea. Instead, the amount of bud in the tea will affect the character of the brewed tea. In general, the more buds, the more subtle the flavor, the more leaves, the more white tea will taste like the flavors you normally associate with tea. There can be very good (and very bad) teas in any of these classifications, so it is more important to find an importer you trust, and whose taste matches yours, than to decide based solely on Silver Needle vs White Peony vs whatever. Also, Silver Needle teas, because of the increased labor involved with picking more buds per gram of tea, will be more expensive.\n\nThere\u2019s an interesting saying that the Chinese have about White Teas:\n\n\u201c\u4e00\u5e74\u8336\u3001\u4e09\u5e74\u836f\u3001\u4e03\u5e74\u5b9d\u201d or \u201cFirst Year it\u2019s Tea, In the Third Year it\u2019s Medicine, after Seven Years it\u2019s Treasure\u201d\n\nSo, finding out Yin xiang hua xia tea, had sent me not just a sample, but an actual \u201ctreasure\u201d was quite a surprise!\n\nAs regards the medicinal claims for white tea, I will say while drinking so much White Tea through December and January, I was rarely ill, while those around me in the office fell prey repeatedly to colds and flus.\n\nAnother point of interest, because the leafier versions of White Tea are so fragile, it actually makes sense to buy it in cakes. The last time I ordered White Tea from China, it was opened and inspected by US Customs. I think unpacking and squeezing the white tea bags was among their priorities, so my tea arrived pretty crushed. If I had, instead, ordered white tea cakes, it might not have been as damaged.\n\nThe second (or sometimes the first ranked) green tea almost always included in the classic list of \u201cChina\u2019s 10 Famous Teas\u201d is called Bi luo Chun, from Suzhou in the Jiangsu province of China. Suzhou is a two hour drive North from Hangzhou, the home of Dragon Well tea. Suzhou is closer to Shanghai, basically directly West from there. This Bi Luo Chun is from Yin xiang hua xia tea and I believe it is their \u201cFresh Bi Luo Chun\u201d.\n\nBi is green, Luo is Snail, and Chun is spring, so the tea\u2019s name translates to Green Snail Spring. The sort of double twist that the tea is shaped into is said to resemble a snail out of its shell, (though it is harder to tell with these fine buds than it was with the coarse Bi Luo Chun from Yunnan.) It is very green, especially when Fresh, and it is only harvested in spring when the buds are smallest.\n\nBi Luo Chun is a much more delicate tea than Dragon Well. This is a particularly fine version, almost entirely the tiniest buds with very few leaves.\n\nIt reminds me a bit of the Ai Lao Mountain Jade Needle White Tea, though it does have some of the same nut character as Dragon Well. It is almost light enough to be a white tea, and it is certainly as bud forward as the Jade Needle tea was, though, of course, the Yunnan tea had much larger buds than these tiny things, which are barely bigger than your fingernail.\n\nFor being such a light tea, it is suprisingly re-steepable, with a clean refreshing broth and very long lasting aftertaste.\n\nI believe I\u2019ve mentioned before, there is a classic list of \u201cChina\u2019s 10 Famous Teas\u201d. There\u2019s a bit of waffling about some of the 4-6 Green Teas usually on the list, but one that is always on, and almost always first, is Long Jing Dragonwell from Hangzhou in China\u2019s Zhejiang province.\n\nI\u2019ve had a bit of a love/hate/fear relationship with Dragon Well tea.\n\nI drank it almost exclusively for several years, accidentally super overdosed one time, and now am a bit nervous about trying it again.\n\nThe problem with highly regarded, highly produced, highly desired, and often expensive Chinese teas, is, you run the risk that the producers will use chemicals or you will actually not get what you asked for.\n\nLike the fact that far more Olive Oil is sold as Italian Extra Virgin Olive Oil than could possibly be produced in Italy, more tea is sold as \u201cLong Jing Dragonwell\u201d than could possibly be produced in that Chinese province. Most often it is simply green tea from another region made in the style of Dragon Well.\n\nI sort of suspect the tea I had such an adverse reaction to may not have been actual Dragon Well and may have been treated with chemicals.\n\nIn any case, that is not this Dragon Well.\n\nYou can see the typical flattened spear shape and lighter olive green color.\n\nBrewed well with water this tea expresses a wonderful nutty taste, chestnut is the flavor used to describe what it evokes, but I get a little bit of coconut. It has a rich broth, lingering flavor, and re-steepability beyond what you would expect from a green tea. There is a little bit of tannic sensation in the later steeps, but no bitterness at all.\n\nI brewed it in a Gaiwan, though it is more typical to brew Dragon Well Tea in a pitcher or glass, refilling with water as you go along.\n\nI\u2019m glad I overcame my reluctance and renewed my acquaintance with Dragon Well, one of China\u2019s Top Teas.\n\nSo, one of the fun things about writing about tea on instagram is that there is a pretty active community of tea drinkers and tea marketers.\n\nAs I mentioned before, it\u2019s not that unusual to post about a type of tea and have someone message you and say, \u201cIf you liked their Baihaoyinzhen, you need to try my Baihaoyinzhen!\u201d Which is pretty fun.\n\nI was kind of finishing up with White Tea by this point, but I thought, \u201cWhy Not?\u201d Plus, they had some other pretty tempting teas listed on their Instagram Account.\n\nAnyway, if you are looking for a very good Fuding White Tea, you should think about ordering from Yin Xiang Hua Xia Tea, as this is about the best White Tea of this type I\u2019ve tried. Amazingly clean taste, great re-steepability, and a length of aftertaste that just won\u2019t quit. Not to mention a nice zippy buzz.\n\nWhen I first started writing about tea on instagram, I got a message out of the blue from Chao Zhou Tea Growers, aka @wudongtea, asking if I would like to try some Organic Oolong Tea.\n\nOolong tea is not particularly common in the US. I had tried a few over the years, but didn\u2019t really know much about it. In fact, I had sort of been avoiding it, as from what I had read, Oolong was basically a whole other world of tea and tea terminology from the basics of White, Green, and Black teas. Many Oolong teas are highly coveted and often quite expensive.\n\nBut, how could I refuse some samples? The usual rule with these deals, I come to understand, is, you buy some of their teas, and they send along some small samples of their other teas.\n\nThe first batch, I bought 100g of their Honey Orchid Oolong, and they sent along samples of their Ya Shi Xiang, aka Duck Poop Fragrance varietal tea.\n\nI drank all the Honey Orchid, but really liked their Duck Shit Oolong, so decided to re-up my supply of that with my next order.\n\nThe previous bunch of teas and samples they had sent had all been in the \u201cOrchid\u201d family of flavors, so I asked them to send me a couple samples that were different varietals/flavors/fragrances.\n\nI sort of thought yesterday\u2019s \u201cJade Dragon\u201d would be the highlight of the Yunnan Sourcing Spring 2018 Green Tea Sampler, but this tea is even more interesting.\n\nFirst, due to the name of the village it is grown in. \u201cThis lovely tea is grown in Mengku County of Lincang in a village called \u201cDofu Zhai\u201d (aka Tofu Village).\u201d Tofu Village!\n\nSecond, it is a special varietal local to \u201cTofu Village\u201d that is a hybrid of pure Camellia sinensis var. assamica and another varietal called \u201cChange Ye Bai Hao\u201d.\n\nThe name, \u201cSong Zhen,\u201d (or \u201cPine Needles,\u201d) of course, comes from the appearance of the processed tea. After the \u201ckill green\u201d step, they are rolled super tightly along the rib to have the appearance, for all anyone knows, of being a pile of pine needles.\n\nBut, mostly, the tea is amazing due to its flavor. It comes out of the gate with a buttery caramel-esque flavor. Seriously. Which gives way to a mild stonefruit core. Finishes with sweetness, a touch of astringency, a very pleasant buzz, and a camphor/menthol sensation that seems to evaporate from your tongue.\n\nThe term \u201cPekoe\u201d in the name of this tea is a bit confusing for me. Usually, \u201cPekoe\u201d refers, when combined with the word \u201cOrange\u201d, to a non-tippy type of broken black tea, from an obscure British/Dutch tea classification system.\n\nHowever, as soon as I taste this tea, I am far less confused. While it isn\u2019t quite the green powerhouse that the Teng Chong Hui Long Zhai was, nor is it the mild mannered tea of either the Green Snail or the Cui Ming.\n\nIt charts a nice path right down the upper middle of the green teas I\u2019ve tried, with very good vegetal pea/bean flavor, nice re-steepability, and a lengthy sweet after-taste. And a pleasantly zippy caffeine buzz. I could defintely drink the heck out of this one, whatever its pedigree.\n\nThere are a group of teas, or type of teas, which are classically called, \u201cChina\u2019s 10 Famous Teas\u201d (or sometimes 8 famous teas).\n\nThis classification goes back to before the communist revolution, at least late 1800s or early 1900s, maybe earlier.\n\nThe list slightly varies a bit from source to source, but it is usually about half green tea.\n\nAt the time, among those green teas, Lake Tai/Dongting Green Snail Spring from Suzhou, Jiangsu, was often considered the best of the best.\n\nSuzhou is in the Central Eastern province, Jiangsu, near Shanghai.\n\nThis isn\u2019t Lake Tai/Dongting Green Snail.\n\nIt is from Yunnan, which is a province in Southern China, bordering Myanmar, Laos, and Vientam.\n\nThe tea grown in the Jiangsu area tend to be on small leafed bushes. The tea grown in Yunnan area tend to be on big leafed, well, actual trees. Distinct varieties of tea are grown in each area, due to the differences in climate.\n\nI haven\u2019t had actual Bi Luo Chun from Jiangsu, so I can\u2019t tell you how much this one resembles the other, but given the differences in regions, I don\u2019t actually expect that this Yunnan Green Snail Bi Luo Chun tastes much like the real thing, from Jiangsu.\n\nHowever, another distinguishing factor in \u201cGreen Snail\u201d tea is how it is formed. As I mentioned, after the \u201cKill Green\u201d step, green tea is usually formed into shapes which allow it to be stored without damaging the leaves.\n\nIn the case of \u201cGreen Snail\u201d the tea is formed into a sort of double coil. First the leaf is rolled vertically, then it is rolled horizontally. The shape is said to resemble a snail which has been cooked and pulled out of its shell. Well, which you can see from the picture, it does. Yum.\n\nWhile this tea may not be real \u201cBi Luo Chun\u201d from Jiangsu, it is a very solid green tea.\n\nI find with these assortments from Yunnan Sourcing, there is usually a couple exceptional teas, one unusual tea, and one that is just a solid, well priced example of the classification. A daily drinker, if you will.\n\nThis tea seems to be the daily drinker in this bunch. It is a super solid example of Yunnan green tea. Good clean flavor, forgiving of careless brewing, stands up to multiple brews, but doesn\u2019t require it. I took it to my Mom\u2019s house over the holiday and drank it every day."
