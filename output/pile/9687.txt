Instead, it continues to get better and better. Last month we gave you more choice for your Moto 360 including new bands, watch faces, and a new feature called Moto Body . Today, we\u2019re announcing a new update to Android Wear that brings you even more ways to customize your Moto 360 while improving the performance.With this upgrade you can now choose from a variety of beautiful, new third-party watch faces through the Google Play Store, created by designers like Rebecca Minkoff and Xogram. You can even choose a fun watch face from the makers of one of the most popular Android games Plants vs. Zombies. This is in addition to the existing ability to design your own watch face through Moto Connect. Once you receive the update, there will be a link to the watch faces collection in the Android Wear companion app The update also introduces new settings. Swiping down from the top of the screen brings new features like Theatre mode, which turns the display off even when receiving notifications, and Sunlight mode, which temporarily maximizes brightness. You can also manage interruptions and access deeper settings quickly. And if you have a phone running Android 5.0, Lollipop , the choices you make on your Moto 360 automatically change the Interruptions setting on your phone.Here are some of the other highlights you can expect after installing the update:For more information check out the release notes . Or for more on Motorola updates and repairs, visit motorola.com/mymoto360 We are enhancing this most recent update to Android Wear with a new, optimized build that squashes a few bugs.

We are rolling out this update to users in phases, and all users should have it by the end of the week."
