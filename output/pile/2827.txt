this.\" \"He's clean and not a drug addict, so he's more my type.\" \"Well, he's got a store full of candy and a penis, so he's more my type.\" \"You know what?\" \"Go for it.\" \"You've got dibs.\" \"Aww, that's so nice of you, Max.\" \"Yeah, and while you're doing him in the back room,\" \"I'll be pocketing some candy.\" \"Oh, no.\" \"It's closed.\" \"Hey, Max, you know what'd be fun?\" \"If we threw that trash can through the front window?\" \"I was gonna say we should leave him a note.\" \"And what would be fun about throwing that can through a window?\" \"Have you ever done it?\" \"It's fun!\" \"Oh, the sign's turned around.\" \"He can see us.\" \"He's smiling at us.\" \"[Giggles]\" \"Should we go in?\" \"If I learned anything as a child, it's when a stranger offers you candy, you say yes.\" \"Hi.\" \"We thought the sign said you were closed.\" \"Yeah, I turned it around.\" \"I wanted you guys to come in.\" \"[Gene Wilder singing Pure Imagination]\" \"\u266a Come with me\"

wonderful.\" \"Look at all the candy crammed in this little space.\" \"It's like we're inside Willy Wonka's colon.\" \"Thanks.\" \"Yeah, it's kind of the look I was going for too.\" \"And I know it's

up.\" \"On the house.\" \"Marry this guy right now.\" \"It's a small store.\" \"I can hear you.\" \"Good.\" \"Moves things along faster.\" \"Hey, come by the Williamsburg diner sometime.\" \"We work there.\" \"We'll give you free samples of food you shouldn't have to pay for anyway.\" \"So, what brings you in to this neighborhood?\" \"Oh, we were having lunch at the-- this ...is a really adorable space.\" \"Thank you.\" \"You know, candy is my passion.\" \"Yeah, I said it.\" \"Always has been.\" \"Even as a kid, I would have my G.I.
