The fear is that it allows martial law.\n\nFrom Defense One:\n\nThe AUMF put for\u00adward by Mc\u00adCon\u00adnell would not re\u00adstrict the pres\u00adid\u00adent\u2019s use of ground troops, nor have any lim\u00adits re\u00adlated to time or geo\u00adgraphy. Nor would it touch on the is\u00adsue of what to do with the 2001 AUMF, which the Obama ad\u00admin\u00adis\u00adtra\u00adtion has used to at\u00adtack IS\u00adIS des\u00adpite that au\u00adthor\u00adiz\u00ada\u00adtion\u2019s in\u00adstruc\u00adtions to use force against those who planned the 9/11 ter\u00adror\u00adist at\u00adtacks.\n\nISIS is in the United States but we are not at a point where we need this extreme measure. Why give this power to this maniac in the White House?\n\nThe AUMF, known as \u201cRule XIV,\u201d has not been placed on the calendar which means it could come up at any time and will. It\u2019s being fast-tracked.\n\nThe res\u00adol\u00adu\u00adtion already has four Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan co\u00adspon\u00adsors: Sens. Lind\u00adsey Gra\u00adham, Daniel Coats, Joni Ernst, and Or\u00adrin Hatch.\n\nSome Demo\u00adcrats were crit\u00adic\u00adal of even the pres\u00adid\u00adent\u2019s own draft AUMF, warn\u00ading that they\u2019d need ad\u00addi\u00adtion\u00adal re\u00adstric\u00adtions from the ad\u00admin\u00adis\u00adtra\u00adtion on troop levels and geo\u00adgraph\u00adic bound\u00adar\u00adies be\u00adfore they could sup\u00adport any au\u00adthor\u00adiz\u00ada\u00adtion, Defense One noted.\n\nThere is deep division over this bill and there will be debate. Hopefully they will specify to not include the US.\n\nObama has enough power to go after ISIS but refuses to do it. His rules of engagement have been absurd.\n\nThe devil will be in the details.\n\nMartial law has no precise meaning but it has common features \u2013 it contemplates military force; government military personnel have the authority to make and enforce civil and criminal laws; and civil liberties are suspended. Martial law was declared by Lincoln during the Civil War \u2013 Proclamation 113 \u2013 and our National Defense Authorization Act included a provision, now removed, which stripped U.S. citizens of their constitutional rights."
