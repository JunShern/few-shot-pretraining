    "text": "6 Films to Scare Your Pants Off . . . and You\u2019ll Love Every Minute of It\n\nIt\u2019s Ansley again with more films to get you ready for Halloween! Last time, I shared some of my favorite horror films that were creepy and atmospheric or just really bizarre and great to watch with friends. The following are the ones to watch in complete darkness\u2014alone\u2014with a high-quality set of headphones. You\u2019re welcome.\n\n1. The Thing (1982, John Carpenter, R)\n\nThe Thing is, in my opinion, the ideal horror film. It\u2019s a perfect storm of elements spiraling together to form something that touches our basest fears: complete and total isolation, dwindling resources, claustrophobic conditions, and the breakdown of trust and relationships. The Thing works because it plays with a shared psychology with masterful execution.\n\n2. Audition (1999, Takashi Miike, NOWVTSSWTE: No One Who Values Their Sanity Should Watch This Ever)\n\nOkay, so Hausu showed us how insane a Japanese horror film can be. Audition gives us the Japanese version of revolting and terrifying. An aging widower\u2019s son wishes his father would re-marry. The father decides to hold a fake film audition to check out potential dates. He falls for one woman in particular who turns out to be a very bad casting choice. Rob Zombie has said that Audition is the most unsettling film that he has ever seen. I\u2019m going to have to agree with Zombie here: this is the only film that ever actually scared me.\n\n3. Silent Hill (2006, Christopher Gans, R)\n\nWhen I initially interact with any human being (or kitty\u2014I like kitties), I establish that I am an \u00fcber fan of the video game series Silent Hill. As I write this, I\u2019m resisting the urge to write a 200-page thesis on the color of James Sunderland\u2019s jacket. Instead, I\u2019ll say, calmly, that while there were a lot of fandom-related things over which to nerd rage, it\u2019s a pretty solid film. The insanely simplified story (although it\u2019s composed of over a decade\u2019s worth of in-game lore condensed into two hours that may confuse some) tells the tale of a little girl at the center of a cult.\n\nThe story feels weak and messy, but the creature execution is dead-on. Silent Hill stands out in the horror-game genre by staying away from zombies and aliens, opting instead for grotesque psychological manifestations of the protagonist\u2019s greatest fears. The creatures in the film are almost entirely the result of practical effects, and it shows. They are also all played by professional dancers (the lying figure is a hip-hop dancer and the nurses are ballerinas, for example). This gives the monsters an uncanny humanity that makes them all the more disturbing. I\u2019m still upset about the fan-service presence of Pyramid Head in the film, but even he looked amazing. Just never, ever, ever speak to me about a film sequel. EVER.\n\n4. Psycho (1960, Alfred Hitchcock, R)\n\nPsycho is my absolute favorite horror novel. It does only what it needs to do\u2014no more, no less. The film adaption, while lacking the main character\u2019s fascinating inner monologue, is a faithful and iconic one. It\u2019s beautiful filmmaking that stands the test of time.\n\n5. Rec (2007, Jaume Balaguer\u00f3 andPaco Plaza, R)\n\nRec is also known as the American film Quarantine, a shot-for-shot remake of the Spanish original. It\u2019s another fine example of the combined elements that make films like The Thing so fantastic: limited time, limited space, and a limited cast. The difference is that Rec acts like a documentary/found-footage film and does so very well. Fortunately, the character doing the \u201cfilming\u201d is a professional cameraman: you don\u2019t have to endure the nauseating and frustrating shaky cam that\u2019s characteristic of most found-footage films.\n\n6. Ju-on (2002, Takashi Shimizu, R)\n\nAs a general rule, most media is better in its original form. This is true of Ju-on, a film that\u2019s far superior to its American remake, The Grudge. It\u2019s a traditional Japanese vengeful-ghost story that will have you checking between the sheets. (Note: One of my favorite horror films of all time is The Ring: the American version of Ringu. It\u2019s not on this list, though, because it\u2019s just a given.)\n\nIf out-and-out horror isn\u2019t your thing, then my next installment might be more up your alley: psychological horror."
