    "text": "Thanks to all those who came to my residents meeting in Ward End last night \u2013 especially colleagues from West Midlands Police. We\u2019ll post a full write up later but the three key local issues raised were;\n1. Speeding and dangerous parking \u2013 especially folks dropping off children at school. We had a long debate about why parents drive their offspring a few hundred yards down the road\n2. Drugdealing \u2013 still seen as a problem especially by the shops on St Margarets Road\n3. Impact of doubling the school size; this was on the whole seen as a good thing; but there was a real worry that parking was going to get much worse\n\nWe then had a long chat about Labours policy review and the things the government was doing wrong. Here\u2019s what was top of residents issue-list;\n1. Lack of jobs especially for young people\n2. Prices especially petrol prices\n3. Immigration\n4. Human rights and influence of judges\n5. Europe \u2013 too much control of decisions lost\n\nAgain, we\u2019ll write this up and make sure it\u2019s part of our policy review work. If you couldn\u2019t come and have a comment email me on byrnel@parliament.UK\n\nThis week, I published my argument for Labour\u2019s approach to creating a country of \u2018powerful people\u2019. I mentioned that over the last ten years, I have been much influenced by the way I thought about this, by my practical experience trying to regenerate Hodge Hill, and philosophically, by Amartya Sen. Sen\u2019s book, An Idea of Justice, was published this summer, and a few weeks ago I interviewed Prof Sen about his work. You can access an excerpt of the interview below\u2026\n\nSome will have seen news in the Guardian and elsewhere today about rights to new services for people with suspected cancer. For those who want more background about the government\u2019s approach to rights, have a look at Working Together \u2013 our strategy for public service reform; World Class Public Services, where we looked at how rights can preserve equity while devolving power. My speech to the CBI sets out some more of the background argument.\n\nYesterday, we had simply the most extraordinary turn-out for our Big Lottery Fund Awards for All masterclass at the Beaufort Sports & Social. Building a stronger network of social entreprenuers is at the absolute core of Hodge Hill 2020 \u2013 our programme for regenerating the constituency. I\u2019ll be posting some of the information we went through and a video report next week, but in the meantime, if you are part of a group in the constituency which wants some help bidding for money, then drop me a line. Also email me if you are doing great things locally \u2013 we want to build a stronger network of community activists where everyone knows what\u2019s going on, and how to get involved. Thanks to all who came along \u2013 and thanks to Big Lottery Fund for answering my call to come and tell us more!\n\nLots of workers at Jaguar Land Rover live in Hodge Hill, and they\u2019ll be worried about the plans that Jaguar Land Rover announced today.\n\nI rang the directors to discuss their plans this afternoon. Here\u2019s what they said.\n\nFirstly, and most importantly, JLR said that they are absolutely committed to the West Midlands \u2013 and want to build \u2018significant\u2019 numbers of new cars in the region. I think the firm will need the same number of workers in the region to build all the new models, which is why JLR has said they don\u2019t want to see compulsory redundancies.\n\nSecondly, when I asked whether government was doing everything they could, JLR said yes \u2013 and they were especially grateful for the \u00a310 million of government aid to build new models.\n\nI agreed to lobby hard for the kind of automotive research institute that will help keep our industry at the world\u2019s cutting edge. Long term, that\u2019s the way we boost manufacturing jobs, not see them go abroad.\n\nThe company must discuss these changes with the trade unions, and I\u2019ll be in touch with them in due course.\n\nBelow is the full text of my John Smith Annual Finance Lecture; The New Opportunity Economy. There\u2019s a bit of a trail in the Guardian today. The argument is simple; is we make the right choices now, we can not only rebalance our economy towards investment and exports, but we can open the new jobs that it is possible to create to people from a wider range of backgrounds, tackling the issue of low pay, and redoubling efforts to get people back to work."
