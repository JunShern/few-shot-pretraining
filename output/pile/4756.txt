    "text": "Speech Speaks: Arrested Development\u2019s Mastermind Thinking Aloud\n\nThis month I had the opportunity to interview Speech from the music group, Arrested Development. This is the first part of a two-part interview in which Speech shares his views on a range of topics including music, black internationalism, politics, and religion.\n\nBorn Todd Thomas in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Speech started Arrested Development in 1987. Based in Georgia, the group became a pioneering force in the music world. Arrested Development received two Grammy Awards for the album, \u201c3 years, 5 months and 2 days in the life of\u2026\u201d Their second album \u201cZingalamaduni\u201d was met with critical acclaim and nominated for a Grammy. However, the group split five years after they had formed. After a much needed break and time to regroup, Speech reemerged onto the scene and signed a solo record deal with EMI. He has released 5 solo albums since 1996\u2013all of which have spawned Top 10 hit singles in Japan. His album \u201cSpiritual People\u201d released in 2000 was certified Gold in Japan and awarded the Best Black Music Album of the year 2000 by ADLIB magazine. In 2000, Speech and Arrested Development began performing together again, delighting audiences all over the world with their positive and up lifting brand of hip hop. Their new albums \u201cChanging the Narrative\u201d and \u201cThis Was Never Home\u201d are available on their website. Follow the band on Twitter @ADtheBand.\u201d\n\nGuy Emerson Mount: Thank you so much for agreeing to do this interview! I was a huge fan growing up and I\u2019m sure I speak for many readers at Black Perspectives in saying that your work has been a significant touchstone in my intellectual development.\n\nSpeech: Thanks, that\u2019s great to hear.\n\nMount: One of the meta-projects of Black Perspectives is to expand the definition of who counts as \u2018an intellectual.\u2019 Your artistry is clearly committed to the life of the mind. What does it mean to be an artist and a thinker?\n\nSpeech: I would say that all artists are thinkers and all thinkers are artists. Both fields are seeped in deep thought and powerful disciplines.\n\nMount: Agreed. Another core commitment of Black Perspectives is an analysis of black internationalism and diasporic exchange. Many readers are probably unaware of the fact that you are a huge deal in Japan. Far from \u201cfalling off\u201d after Zingalamaduni in 1994, you have been busy the last two decades stretching the spatial limits of black thought across the Pacific. How do you read the Asian hip-hop scene and its interactions with black people and black culture?\n\nSpeech: It\u2019s fascinating! They are very appreciative of our culture and they are studious in striving to learn about it, imitate, and evangelize it. It\u2019s encouraging for us as American artists, because many of the Asian cultures really respect us more than we respect ourselves. They treat us with more care and awe than we do towards each other in America.\n\nMount: What\u2019s it like being black in Japan?\n\nSpeech: While I\u2019ve never lived in Japan, from what I\u2019ve heard while touring, it\u2019s great for men and jarring for women. Sexism is even more rampant there than it is here. Racially, I\u2019ve had funny situations backstage where excited Japanese fans have come up to us and said, \u201cWe love Niggers!\u201d\n\nMount: Whoa! Just a little problematic!\n\nSpeech: Yeah, but it was also hilarious because we knew by their faces and expressions that they meant absolutely no harm. They were simply going by the term that is used to describe us so much in contemporary rap music. And the language gap is such that many times they only understand general themes of rap music not the nuances. But I\u2019ve always said that as rap has now grown up, it is even more important to create this extremely powerful music with purpose and not just acting as if we are only speaking to our \u201cblocks\u201d or \u201choods.\u201d We are projecting an image of us worldwide that can either work for our advancement or against it.\n\nMount: Good point. In the U.S. all we typically see about blackness in Asia is a handful of spectacular cases of appropriation, Asian people in blackface, or blatant anti-black racism. So it sounds like we might be missing a much deeper solidarity and affinity forming on the ground between black and Asian people through hip hop itself.\n\nSpeech: I think what we are missing is the deep emotional weapon we have at our disposal! Fela Kuti said, \u201cMusic is a weapon of the future.\u201d\n\nMount: Shifting to more overt politics, I know that you have been an active supporter of both Black Lives Matter and Democratic party politics all while standing upon a more general black revolutionary platform in your music that is, in some ways, far to the Left of them both. As much as Pan-Africanism and Afrocentricity are clearly central to your thought you also make significant gestures in your music towards universalism, interracialism, and a class-based solidarity. How have your politics changed over time and where do you stand now vis-a-vis the current American political scene?\n\nSpeech: I used to speak about revolution even if the revolution resorted to aggressive violence. This included lyrics from \u201cGive A Man A Fish\u201c:\n\nThis government needs to be over thrown, brothers with their AK\u2019s and the 9mm\u2019s need to learn how to correctly shoot \u2018em, save those rounds for a revolution, poor whites and blacks bum rushing the system.\n\nBecause of my Christian faith and my belief that there are spiritual ways to demolish strongholds, I no longer subscribe to violent aggression as something that I would support. However, for those that do subscribe to it, I still agree with what my lyrics say, namely, that violence and self-defense is one means to accomplish the revolution. Whether it be songs like, \u201cUnited Minds,\u201d \u201cShell,\u201d \u201cRaining Revolution,\u201d or \u201cGive a Man a Fish.\u201d\n\nMount: What\u2019s the state of the revolution as you see it today and where are the openings for black activists and thinkers to best advance your vision for social change?\n\nSpeech: The revolution is about fundamental change! We as a people throughout the diaspora must focus on unity of purpose\u2014the purpose being self-determination and setting aside for the sake of unity the things that divide us (i.e., religion, class, etc.); create dependable information vehicles for our purpose to thrive (i.e. news shows, entertainment, business and culture vehicles); and 3) pool our resources together (i.e. support our own businesses financially, circulate our talents for collective growth, pool our natural resources together, world wide).\n\nMount: I agree provided, of course, we don\u2019t end up defending capitalism or supporting something like #BankBlack uncritically. I know I would definitely classify your music as anti-capitalist and in listening to your recent TED talk you state that in a world of empty consumerism \u201c[m]y spirit taught me that purpose lies in the glorious fields. Creating new narratives with vast possibilities and roads that have yet to be traveled.\u201d Your new album is also titled \u201cChanging The Narrative\u201d and you describe it as \u201cchanging the topic of discussion from living the American Dream to being awake from it.\u201d This theme of the master narrative of American history harkens me to Ta-Nehisi Coates\u2019s critique of the \u201cDreamers.\u201d Why do you think acknowledging the nightmare of the American dream is so traumatic for these Dreamers?\n\nSpeech: I think because it\u2019s a deeply dark, grotesque, and traumatic history. And yet refusing to acknowledge it is like refusing to look at yourself in the mirror. It is from this beautiful and bloody history that we arrive at today, it\u2019s a necessary journey for healing. The sole barrier is lack of priority. We are double-minded in our purpose. We love to wallow in oppression when the oppression is sheer materialism, the worship of money, the love of decadence or the love of pleasure but we hate oppression when some of us are murdered or imprisoned by that same system. When the system gives a few of us wealth, many of us cling to the dream of having that wealth as well, instead of seeing the system as manipulating us. We still believe that the system had us in mind when it promised, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness and in due time it will make its way to us all.\n\nMount: In your TED talk you also state that \u201cMy life, my music, it would always explore these alternatives and celebrate the unseen. The unseen tomorrows. The possible heavens on earth that we can create.\u201d I see these statements, and your music, arguing for a cautious but enduring belief in an empowering brand of hopefulness. How do you square your hopefulness with your commitment to \u2018The Struggle,\u2019 as Coates calls it, even when you know full well the dangers of an overly-romantic hope-based teleology? Can we ever escape the passivity that hope so often engenders? Do we even need hope as a touchstone for empowerment at all or is there another way that we can access that power without all the baggage? Is there a way to salvage hope from its own hegemony?\n\nSpeech: I believe hope is the only thing that matters as long as it is fortified with action. Hope alone, like faith, is dead without deeds. I believe hopeless activism is an oxymoron.\n\nShare with a friend:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 AAIHS. May not be reprinted without permission"
