We were forced to see this story in all the national news channels but why i don't understand, was OSAMA so important for us or is OBAMA so important for us . Both are culprits against HUMANITY in some or the other way. So why to see both of them through different glasses. OSAMA had killed AMERICANS and OBAMA is killing numerous NON-AMERICANS so where is the difference.\n\nLIBIYA is the newest victim of america and i feel every other oil producing countries will become victims of america soon or later. Only america will search out for some justified way to do this unjust brutal job. I am very sad today off course not because of OSAMA'S killing but because my countrymen seems to be standing with America because of a unseen threat. Believe only we need a day to stand up its very easy for us to live without america or american products but it will be very worse for them to live without our market and manpower....HATE AMERICA TO LOVE INDIA....."
