    "text": "The Sweet Service Award goes to Woolworths in the Waterfront, and its Manager Warren Sitzer. I received poor service in looking to buy wine glasses in the Homeware department, so poor that I went to buy some at @Home instead. At Country Road inside the Woolworths store I wanted to pay for a top, but there was no staff member to be seen. I wanted to relate both service issues to a manager, and Warren listened, apologised with charm, and brought me some roses. He said he remembered my son and I shopping at the Paarl Mall branch more than ten years ago, when we lived in Franschhoek. He also shared the amazing developments lying ahead for this Waterfront branch. He invited me to chat to him at any time that I experience any problems at this branch. Wow!\n\nLast week I invited my friends Clint and Llewellyn Lambert (GM of the Franschhoek Boutique Hotel, and influential blogger at Hospitality Hedonist) to join me for dinner at Le Petit Manoir in Franschhoek, which opened in July. Having had more than enough time to settle in, it was a severely (and costly) experience, of a completely dysfunctional restaurant. I apologise for the longer than average Review, summarizing my experiences with Chef Kevin Grobler\u2019s cooking since 2015. (more\u2026)\n\nIt has been deduced from Instagram posts advertising for new staff by The Test Kitchen Chef Ryan Cole that Chef Luke Dale-Roberts is to open his fourth restaurant in Cape Town, called Salsify @ The Roundhouse, to be located in The Roundhouse in Camps Bay. (more\u2026)\n\nThe Sweet Service Award goes to the Twelve Apostles Hotel, and its F & B Manager Hilton Ruch. On my way home from dancing at Constantia Nek recently, I stopped by at their Caf\u00e9 for a dry cappuccino. Not expecting Hilton to be at work after 22h00, I asked one of the staff to pass on my regards to him. She told me he was still at work, and called him. He chatted, and told me about their new Vegan High Tea, a first in Cape Town it would seem, as well as other news. The dry cappuccino was perfectly made, and they have marshmallows too, a weakness. When I requested the bill, I was told that Hilton had taken care of it,(more\u2026)\n\nEver since I reviewed Chef Bertus Basson\u2019s Spek & Bone dive of a restaurant in Stellenbosch in July last year, Basson has been on a mission to discredit me as a reviewer, not being man-enough to accept my honest feedback. Last week I popped in at his latest eatery, De Vrije Burger, a hamburger and ice cream joint, on Plein Street in Stellenbosch, the take-away outlet being far below the standard of his Eat Out Top 10 award stature! One wonders why he is scraping the barrel with cheap and nasty restaurants, when he started off with the top level Top 10 Overture restaurant, his first! Each new restaurant, of his five restaurants, is one level below the previously opened one in terms of quality! (more\u2026)\n\nOn a day that was already going well, it was hard to imagine that it could get even better with an invitation to attend the 2017 launch of the #HQFineWining (what a clever hashtag) series of food and wine pairing dinners. Graham Beck bubblies were served and we were told that bubbly pairs well with all kinds of foods, including the well-known HQ steak! (more\u2026)\n\nYesterday I completed my Gourmet Tour of France, eating at the 50th restaurant on the World\u2019s 50 Best Restaurant list, being Septime in Paris. It has one Michelin star, and has held it for the past four years. Despite being understated and hidden in its location, it offers world-class cuisine served by an enthusiastic team. (more\u2026)\n\nToday I depart on a two-week eating tour of France, continuing my World\u2019s 50 Best Restaurant journey I began in New York and London in July last year. There is no more exciting start to my culinary trip than dinner at JAN restaurant in Nice on Wednesday, given that it has just been awarded the 2017 Michelin one-star rating. In February 2016 owner Jan-Hendrik van Der Westhuizen did our country proud, in becoming the first South African chef to own a Michelin-star restaurant. (more\u2026)\n\nIt is rare to see a restaurant serve only two options of food, and its name Burger&Lobster is true to reflecting this new restaurant, which opened a month ago in a heritage building on Bree Street. (more\u2026)\n\nYesterday I had the honour to get to know Koekedoor judge Mari-Louis Guy better over a 3\u00bd hour period, first visiting the Cakebread Studio which she owns with her brother and business partner Callie Maritz. The get-together was crowned with a visit to the One & Only Cape Town, where the three of us indulged in what is my favorite Afternoon Tea in Cape Town. (more\u2026)"
