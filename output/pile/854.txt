    "text": "Event Details\n\nYOW! DepthFirst Workshop\n\nMicroservices: Let's Build Some! with Fred George\n\nIt is one thing to talk about Microservices. It is another altogether to have to build them. After a brief introduction of Microservice principles, we will watch an animation of a micro\u00adservice environment. We will start with new versions of pre\u00adbuilt skeleton microservice environment (RabbitMQ message bus with a couple of starter services in Java, C#, and Ruby). We will then design and implement additional services to broaden the overall functionality. These additional services can be written in any language that will run on the participant's laptop. While pairing is strongly encouraged, it is not required.\n\nIn the final stage, different pairs will implement different services, yet they will all run together implementing the animation.\n\nThroughout the workshop, we will stop as participants come across common issues with Microservices. We will use this time to discuss best practices.\n\nWe wrap up with the participants making observations on what they learned (and how it may be different from Microservices they are currently implementing, if any). This is followed by presentations on Microservice challenges and the organization impact of rapidly developed Microservices.\n\nWHAT YOU WILL LEARN\n\nThe focus of the workshop will be on:\n\nUnderstanding how to design asynchronous service architectures\n\nCreating small, yet functional, services rather than larger services,\n\nReducing coupling to the bare minimum (JSON packets with extra fields ignored), and\n\nDebugging asynchronous systems.\n\nWHAT TO BRING\n\nParticipants are required to bring a suitable development machine (portable) for working through the exercises.\n\nis a Developer and Co\u00adfounder at Outpace Systems, and has been writing code for over 46 years in (by his count) over 70 languages. He has delivered projects and products across his career, and in the last decade alone, has worked in the US, India, China, and the UK. He started ThoughtWorks University in Bangalore, India, based on a commercial programming training program he developed in the 90\u2019s. An early adopter of OO and Agile.\n\nFred continues to impact the industry with his leading\u00ad edge ideas, most recently advocating Micro\u00adservice Architectures and flat team structures (under the moniker of Programmer Anarchy). Oh, and he still writes code!\n\nCompany - Programming for 46 years, now Microservice Fanboy and Programmer Anarchist.\n\nWhat else is coming up?\n\nYOW! Lambda Jam\n\nIt's Sydney's turn to feel the Lambda Jam with this event being held there for the first time. This event is perfect for those that want to ratchet up their Functional Programming skills. Improve your skills in languages like Clojure, Scala, Erlang, Haskell, or F# at YOW! Lambda Jam. Sydney, 8-9 May\n\nYOW! Connected\n\nYOW! Connected is a two day Conference exploring the world of Mobile development and the Internet of Things (IoT). Get unbiased and technically rich talks on topics that include include native development for iOS and Android, the developing market for the IoT, UX & design, back end development and the review of several business case studies. Melbourne, 5-6 October\n\nGroup tickets and Sponsorship\n\nTransfer, Cancellation and Refunds\n\nIn the event that you are unable to attend, you may send another person to attend in your place provided you inform YOW! organisers of the change not less than 72 hours prior to the workshop. Please see our full terms and conditions."
