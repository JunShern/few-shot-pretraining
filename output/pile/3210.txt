    "text": "Q:\n\nAzure and File.CreateText: FileNotFoundException: Could not find file\n\nI have a simple .Net Core MVC web application that I deploy to Azure. In the application, I am creating a little text file called \"test.txt\" using File.CreateText(). This works fine on my local PC, but when I deploy it to Azure, I get a strange message: \"Could not find file 'D:\\home\\site\\wwwroot\\wwwroot\\test.txt'.\"\nIndeed, the file does not exist--that's why I'm creating it. Also, it appears someone else on SO is having a similar problem: FileNotFoundException when using System.IO.Directory.CreateDirectory()\nDo I not have write permissions? Why is Azure not letting me create the file?\nCode (in Startup.cs):\npublic void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env){\n    using (var sw = File.CreateText(env.WebRootPath + \"/test.txt\")) { }\n}\n\nScreenshot of error:\n\nA:\n\nI found the reason for this error shortly after posting this question, but forgot to post the answer:\nIt turns out that when you deploy to Azure, your site runs from a temporary directory, which gets wiped and re-created every time you deploy. Because of this, Azure disables the creation and editing of files in the app's directory, since they're just going to get wiped upon your next deployment (it would be nice if the error message Azure displayed was a little more informative).\nTherefore, the way to create and edit files on your Azure app and have them persist across deployments is to use one of the following:\n\nDatabase BLOB storage (simply store your files as byte arrays in a database. doesn't cost any money if you are already using a database)\nAzure BLOB storage (store your files to a special cloud on Azure. costs money)\n\nI read this on some site shortly after posting this question but I can't remember where, so I apologize for not having the source.\n\n"
