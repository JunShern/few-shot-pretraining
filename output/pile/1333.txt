    "text": "The internet revolution\n\nBuzzFeed UK editor Luke Lewis speaks to Grace Marsh about launching in the UK, British humour and what makes the site so successful\n\nTuesday 30 September 2014\n\nHow did you get involved in BuzzFeed?\n\nBuzzFeed launched in the UK in March 2013. It had been established in the US and actually goes back all the way to 2006. They really started ramping it up, and it started becoming more of a big deal really in 2011/12. So that\u2019s when I became a huge fan of what they were doing so I contacted them and kind of figured that they might want to launch in the UK. So I said if you do, if you\u2019re thinking about it, then you should consider me. And actually I was kind of right in that position because they were thinking about launching, they just hadn\u2019t really got round to it yet. So yeah, that happened in early 2013.\n\nWhat was it like when you first started?\n\nInitially, it was very much kind of experimental, there was only three of us, we were sharing an office which was another company\u2019s, you know, it was quite low key. The audience was there, and since then we\u2019ve been building it up so the UK editorial team is about 30 people now. In terms of consumers, now we have 15 million unique users in the UK and globally 150 million per month.\n\nWhat makes BuzzFeed UK different from BuzzFeed US?\n\nThe main thing that distinguishes BuzzFeed in the UK from in the US is our focus on humour. So if you look at all the most viral, most widely shared articles that we\u2019ve ever done in the UK, they\u2019re mostly funny. That\u2019s not really true in the US; humour is a pretty big part of what they do, but it\u2019s not like the number one priority.\n\nHow have you adapted content for a UK audience?\n\nAround about the time that we launched, things that were doing very well in the US was cute animal stuff, chill, uplift articles were very popular\u2014a really huge article around that time was \u2018photos that will restore your faith in humanity\u2019. That kind of thing was really popular in the US and we kind of experimented with that in the UK, but it didn\u2019t work that well. But when we focused more specifically on humour, self-deprecating humour and regional identity is another one \u2013 those things worked incredibly well so we really focused on those.\n\nWhat do you think makes people enjoy reading things like \u2018ten reasons why you\u2019re from the north\u2019?\n\nThere is a slight element of mockery invovled, especially self-mockery, that\u2019s an important thing. When we\u2019re writing about a certain niche, or a certain regional identity, you want people who are part of that identity to share it themselves, so if it\u2019s really nasty, sort of slagging off Geordies for example, then they wouldn\u2019t share it, but if it\u2019s sort of gently mocking in a way that they can agree with, then it works. Because you know that\u2019s just the great British thing. Self-depreciating humour is a really big part of our identity.\n\nWhat makes regional identity so important?\n\nThe reason that ide\u00adntity is really powerful I think is that British media traditionally has kind of ignored the regions beyond London. And so we were really keen to not do that on BuzzFeed. In fact we want to embrace that more actually. We\u2019re gonna sort of ramp up the amount of regional stuff that we\u2019re doing.\n\nHow do the British public respond to articles about cute cats and Kim Kardashian?\n\nHumour is extremely important to us, then there\u2019s also the whole news side of BuzzFeed and celebrity stuff; it\u2019s always popular but it tends not to be shared that well. Those kind of things, Kim Kardashian, there\u2019s a lot of entertainment value. They do quite well from the homepage and people do like to read it, but then people won\u2019t necessarily share it. It\u2019s part of the mix, but not necessarily our main focus.\n\nHow popular is sport on BuzzFeed?\n\nIt\u2019s the same with sport as with celebrity stuff; we kind of dipped our toe in the water with sport, but it\u2019s an area that is very, very well served in the British media, by the newspapers and we\u2019ve not quite found a route into that. Maybe in the future, but at the moment, sport is now something we\u2019re really focused on.\n\nIs it BuzzFeed\u2019s unique, easy to read format that makes it so successful?\n\nYes, absolutely. We\u2019re thinking about impact and accessibility. For a couple of hundred years, the format of a news story has not really changed very much. It\u2019s about 500 words of copy, with one picture at the top. Especially news online, there\u2019s not been much kind of innovation; they\u2019re really just taken from newspapers. They\u2019re just repurposed, with one picture and 500 words of copy and often it\u2019s just rewritten from the wire.\n\nWhat makes BuzzFeed different?\n\nWe do like to think about how we like to present news stories and getting away from that classic structure of a newspaper which is often like an inverted pyramid. Newspaper journalists will try to cram as many details as they can into the first few sentences and then the story gets less and less relevant.\n\nHow do you achieve this?\n\nWe kind of flip it on its head and we make it more conversational, a bit more chronological. News journalists will often just start at the beginning \u2013 this is the person, this is his name, this is how old he is. And then you kind of start telling it like a story, as if you were in conversation with a friend. So I think that\u2019s what makes our news stories a little bit less artificial and a little bit more conversational, which I think is why they work well on Facebook.\n\nIs Facebook the most popular sharing platform?\n\nIt definitely is yeah, but that just reflects the fact that it\u2019s the biggest social media platform by far. The second biggest one is Pinterest and the third is Twitter. To be honest, Twitter is slightly bigger in the UK but globally Pinterest drives significantly more interest than Twitter because it\u2019s huge in the US.\n\nHow can students get themselves noticed on the internet?\n\nYou can kind of make the mistake of trying to be on every platform. I\u2019m not personally on Pinterest; it drives a lot on interest on BuzzFeed but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s a great way of selling yourself. Facebook is kind of underrated as a way of promoting yourself. I\u2019ve always had a public facebook profile and posted lots of links there, and have now built up a bit of a following. I think sometimes people neglect Facebook and focus on Twitter.\n\nWhy is the more light-hearted content so popular on BuzzFeed?\n\nIt just reflects the reality of how people consume content nowadays. I think the organising principal of the web now is the kind of activity stream, especially the Facebook newsfeed. If you look at your newsfeed right now, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s news stories and serious stuff about what\u2019s going on in the world, but there\u2019s also stuff about your friends and family, throwaway entertaining stuff as well. And I think that\u2019s just how people live their lives. So it makes sense that BuzzFeed should reflect that. So you\u2019ve got the serious and the light-hearted, entertaining co-exisiting very closely and I think that\u2019s just a natural reflection of life really.\n\nI think that\u2019s great. It\u2019s great writing about universities because all it takes is for one person to put it on Facebook and people in their year share it, then it starts to spread to people that once went to that university and it ends up as being tens of thousands of people and that\u2019s brilliant, that\u2019s what BuzzFeed is all about really."
