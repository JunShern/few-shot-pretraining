You must download you plist file to some folder in application sandbox (documents or caches) and read it from there.\nYour possible workflow for reading that plist can be:\n\nCheck if plist file is present at download location. If yes - read it from there\nIf it is not present - read plist shipped with your bundle (or copy plist file from bundle to download location and go to step 1 - this way workflow may be a bit more consistent)\n\n"
