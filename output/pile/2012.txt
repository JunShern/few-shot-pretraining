    "text": "Q:\n\nAndroid : Combine normal widget and SurfaceView\n\nI have create a screen with two kind of views : normal view (buttons to receive up/down action ) and surfaceview. The SurfaceView implements SurfaceHolder.Callback and run on another thread and have a method name Tick().\nWhen those buttons receive action, they will call method Tick(),  and I want this method will run same thread with SurfaceView (for synchronize purpose), but don't know how to.\nPlease give me some idea for my issues.\nThanks :)\n\nA:\n\nIf you really want to run Tick() method in separate thread which also draws on the surface you can use HandlerThread for it. So you will be able to create Handler for it and post runnables which will be executed in this thread. But this also will put some restrictions on your drawing routine - you need to prevent it from sleeping or waiting because thread need to process message queue.\nBut actually I suppose any other reasonable way of synchronization will be easier than running this method on the same thread.\n\n"
