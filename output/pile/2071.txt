I was using this\n[https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/nnbmlagghjjcbdhg...](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/nnbmlagghjjcbdhgmkedmbmedengocbn)\nbut the plugin seems better.\n\nOnly problem is that now .doc/.ppt via extension is gone because I had to\ndisable it to get plugin support. Need a rev of that extension to remove pdf\nsupport, and then we're saved!\n\nUpdate: hmm, miss regular context menu too.\n\n~~~\ne40\nI disabled the extension, but pdf's just download... I have 6.0.437.1, which\nshould be the dev channel version. Windows.\n\nIdeas?\n\n~~~\nrictic\nYou also need to go to chrome://plugins and enable the experimental PDF\nplugin.\n\n~~~\ne40\nThanks!\n\n------\nmattchew\nThis is fantastic news--mostly because of the sandboxing. Once burned, twice\nshy--I'm not allowing 3rd party plugins in my main browser any more. But I'm\nwilling to trust Google to sandbox these features correctly. (Don't let me\ndown, guys.)\n\n------\nsingular\nBrilliant. The idea that loading a PDF won't cause a horrible browser freeze-\nup then require controls unrelated to the rest of the browsing experience is\nquite a lovely one.\n\nI wonder what impact this will have on scribd, at least the 'avoid pdf pain'\nside of their business?\n\n~~~\nsliverstorm\n> I wonder what impact this will have on scribd, at least the 'avoid pdf pain'\n> side of their business?\n\nThere's a way to answer that. What is their userbase like, and do they run\nChrome? If the primary browser is still IE (and it kind of seems to me like\n'easing PDF pain' is incongruous with people who have total understanding and\ncontrol of their interaction with the internet) then scribd will be safe\nfor... how long did it IE6 last? Probably about that long.\n\n~~~\nsingular\nTrue, true. Perhaps Google can use this as a selling point to ordinary users?\nThough of course a large number of these are going to be using computers at\nwork which usually means IE[6-8].\n\n------\ntimdorr\nThe one thing that I've _hated_ about Chrome is now fixed. I never have a\nreason to go back to Firefox now. See ya, Mozilla!\n\n~~~\npavs\nThere are plugins both in Chrome and FF where any PDF links automatically\nopens it up using google docs. Much more faster smoother than native PDF\nloading. I just tried out this new integrated PDF on Chrome Dev channel\n(6.0437.1), and as mentioned it doesn't have all the PDF features, it loads\nPDFs on the left hand corner, instead of center. Much much faster though.\n\n~~~\nbtmorex\nMy experience has been that downloading + opening pdfs with a decent pdf\nviewer is much faster than google docs. I personally use evince, but probably\nanything other than acrobat would work.\n\n------\nriobard\nThe rendering quality is sub-standard compared to Safari on OS X at the\nmoment, but I'm really excited there is another browser vendor trying to solve\nthis problem!\n\n------\nInclinedPlane\nI like this so far. On a few experiments it rendered pdfs well, very fast, and\ndidn't feel nearly as clunky as reading a pdf in the browser usually does.\n\n------\ndevinus\nLooks like it's using at least libtiff and lcms from running `strings` on the\nplugin...\n\n------\nramidarigaz\nMmmm... Sounds really cool. Waiting on the Linux version.\n\n------\nsliverstorm\nI can't decide if Chrome is leading the way, or pulling ahead, but the gap is\nwidening considerably.\n\nI, for one, welcome our small round red-yellow-green-blue overlords.\n\n~~~\nwyclif\nChrome 5.0.375.70 on Ubuntu Lucid still leaks memory terribly, forcing me to\nkill processes (tabs). Anyone here with insight on this?\n\n~~~\nsliverstorm\nI have been running the dev build for a long time (6.0) and I leave it and\nsome particular tabs open for days at a time, never had a problem.\n\n~~~\nsliverstorm\nI forgot to clarify, running the dev build on Ubuntu. I am using 10.04 right\nnow.\n\n"
