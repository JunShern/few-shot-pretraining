This method is stated, but not described, and I can't find anything more specific online. p44/45 of 2nd Ed for reference.\n\nadding to the current gene value an amount drawn randomly from a Gaussian distribution with mean zero and user-specified standard deviation\n\nWould be great to get the step by step, from initial to mutated value, including how Gaussian distribution works (or a link to something that could fill that gap).\n\nA:\n\nA gaussian distribution is that favorite curve from math and stats also known as the bell curve or a normal distribution.\nAn example of this can be seen with the sum of rolling 10x 10 sided dice:\n\nFrom AnyDice output 10d10\nWhat this means is that the amount of mutation for a gene is most likely very little.  If you roll this set of dice 30 times, you'll get some data that looks like:\n53, 38, 52, 62, 51, 50, 71, 44, 52, 55, 56, 45, 48, 67, 48, 63, 33, 40, 62, 60, 54, 48, 67, 60, 44, 63, 50, 50, 64, 56\nNotice that most of these numbers are fairly close to the value of 55.  Thats the key to this - you want a middle value.\nWhen doing a mutation on a gene that has a possible change of -10 .. +10 you want most of the chance to be about 0.  Maybe some 1s, or 2s, or -1s, or -2s... but you don't want a +10 to have an equal chance of a mutation as a +1.\nSo? How do you do this?\nIn Java, one would use java.util.Random#nextGaussian().  That will give you a number that has a normal distribution with a mean of 0.0.\nYou would take the value you get from nextGaussian(), and then... well, do math to it to get it into the range you want.  Just because you're getting a number with a mean of 0.0 doesn't mean that any given value will be in a certain range.\nThe specifics of the nextGaussian() for your chosen language is just a matter of finding the right library for the language.  Its there somewhere.  You may wish to browse the tag: normal-distribution on Stack Overflow filtered for your language to see if any of those questions specifically help you.\n\n"
