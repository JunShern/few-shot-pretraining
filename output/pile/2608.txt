    "text": "The line between state-owned Gazprom and the Russian state is often blurry. The monopoly's primary activity is selling natural gas in Europe at market rates to subsidize energy prices domestically. Several board members wear two hats and also work in government; for example, Dmitri A. Medvedev, the hand-picked successor of President Vladimir V. Putin, is chairman of Gazprom.\n\nYou thought that you knew where I was and whenBut it looks like they've been foolin' you again,You thought that you'd got me all staked outBut baby looks like I've been breaking outI'm a dark horseRunning on a dark race courseI'm a blue moonSince I stepped from out of the wombI've been a cool jerkLooking for the sourceI'm a dark horse.You thought you had got me in your gripBaby looks like you was not so smartAnd I became too slippery for youBut let me say that was nothing new.I'm a dark horseI thought that you knew it all alongUntil you started getting me not rightSeems as if you heard a little lateBut I warned you whenWe both were at the starting gateI'm a dark horse\n\nNorth America as we know it has changed dramatically since November 4, 2008.\n\nFirst came the election of an unknown; a man only whose globalist elite masters know where he was born and in which direction he will be taking the liberty-loving United States of America.\n\nLess than one month later, the proud Dominion of Canada is being laid siege to by an opposition-led coalition of the left. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, elected with an increased number of seats only six weeks ago, has a date with destiny at 9:30 this morning.\n\nA beleaguered looking Harper, who addressed Canadians last night on television, promised to use \"every legal means\" to stop the Opposition's move to unseat his minority Conservative government next week. It is his only means to end the threat of this overnight attempt at Government-by-Coalition.\n\nIn other words, Harper will be asking the governor general this morning to suspend Parliament until next month--giving him time to come up with the stimulus package, his power-lusting opponents not his electors, say he hasn't delivered quickly enough.\n\nWere it not for this drastic change in power for which nobody voted, it would have been laughable that New Democrat Leader Jack Layton, the man called \"the Barack Obama of Canada\" by colleagues, had tried unsuccessfully to horn in for his \"cut of the television air time pie\". (GlobeandMail.com, Dec. 3, 2008).\n\nHistory is being rewritten before our very eyes by the Socialists of two nations.\n\nLong after we're all gone, what has happened in a short time-span before Christmas 2008 will surely give pause to the historians.\n\nIn more temperate times, the historians would be forgiven for mistaking the latest James Bond film Quantum of Solace detailing the work of a moviedom George Soros and Maurice Strong as art imitating real life.\n\nBut only in the movies and not in real life do dramatic things happen overnight.\n\nIn reality, what has happened here and in the United States was long in the making.\n\nGradually over time, we elected politicians who cared not for the ecosystem of country Constitutions in comparison to their power lust. Somehow we didn't seem to notice when government no longer worked for us, but us for them.\n\nThe average person was kept too busy coming up with the rent or the mortgage, too busy wondering why their children were learning not reading, writing and arithmetic, but how to become effective global citizens.\n\nPoliticians elected each term, by and large, got worse and worse until we reached a stage where they came not with altruism and leadership guiding their moral compass, but with teams of lawyers who could trash constitutions no matter how noble or time-honoured.\n\nAlong the way, we one day reached the level where civic politicians got to be very high handed. Instead of us being able to tell them to return from federal and international issues to take out the garbage, they told us to take out the garbage, and to put it in an increasing assembly of recycling bins.\n\nThe only real \"change\" politicians made manifest is the one where they no longer choose to hide their true intentions. The rats in the farmers' barns no longer dive for cover in the loft when the farmer comes in.\n\nThey stand there boldly ready to attack the farmer and anyone else who questions their self-imposed authority.\n\nIt has reached a tipping point where politicians no longer feel a duty to serve the people, but only themselves and each other.\n\nThey are just like the \"robber barons\", the term Wikipedia says that \"revived in the 19th century in the United States as a reference to businessman and bankers who dominated their respected industries and amassed huge personal fortunes, typically as a direct result of pursuing various anti-competitive or unfair business practices.\"\n\nOne long ago day, Government went out and began funding environmentalists, not true-at-heart ones who conserve the land against urban blight and pollution, but radical environmentalists like Greenpeace, who over time became as rich and powerful as any of the robber barons.\n\nGovernments caved into environmentalist demands on eminent domain issues that confiscated land on the glib alibi it was to protect endangered species, never recognizing human beings as endangered species.\n\nGovernment catered more and more to the environmentalists and the unions that cheered them on until the car industry could no longer manufacture \"gas-guzzling SUVs\" and was driven along the road to the dead end of bankruptcy.\n\nMeanwhile, our politicians skipped off into a safe zone where they are no longer held accountable, morphing us into a global economy where decisions are made globally. \"Think globally, act locally\" became the mantra of the moment decades ago. That \"safe area\" they ran to includes the model of the European Union, whose administrators choose to keep going when members ask them to slow down because they don't understand what they are even voting on.\n\nThe little people who matter most watched the protest movement abandon the arena. When it mattered most for them to be there, they had scattered.\n\nIn Canada, we face the lies of Government-by-Coalition. In the US, what has been described as \"the first Coalition President in 75 years\".\n\nBoth lie to the people of both nations.\n\nThe debut of Barack Obama has nothing to do with the colour of his skin, or even the station in his life. The world is not kind enough to produce political miracles. Obama's decent brother, George Hussein Onyango, struggling in poverty back in Kenya is living proof of that.\n\n\"Canada's Barack Obama\" Jack Layton offers no true change for Canadians, his long record as a self-serving career politicians proves it.\n\nBeyond both these arrogant activists, we all find out too late that the North American Union is just another term for One World Government.\n\nSocialism, advocated by both Obama and Layton, has sucked the soul out of humanity wherever it was ever attempted, but that's the road North America is now careening down.\n\nHeaven help the people of both betrayed nations.\n\nJudi McLeod is an award-winning journalist with 30 years experience in the print media. A former Toronto Sun columnist, she also worked for the Kingston Whig Standard. Her work has appeared on Newsmax.com, Drudge Report, Foxnews.com, and Glenn Beck.\n\nWith the multiplicity of terrorist attacks perpetrated recently by deviant and fanatic individuals, the General Secretariat of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC) has noticed a tendency of a section of the media, to interpose the word \"Islam\" in reporting these incidences.\n\nWho you gonna believe, Tovarich Dhimmi? Your own eyes, or the peaceful, tolerant, compassionate General Secretariat of the OIC?\n\nSometimes when facing common troubleWhen whole town is screwedWe become actually humanAct like Prometheus wouldSuddenly there is more humorAnd a party tabor stylePeople ringing one another\"Yo man, how was your blackout?\"Suddenly there is more musicMade with the buckets in the parkGirls are dancing with the flashlightsI got only one guitar!And you see brothers and sistersAll engaged in sport of helpMaking merry out of nothingLike in refugee campOh yeah Oh no, it doesn't have to be soIt is possible any time anywhereEven without any doughOh yeah Oh no, it doesn't have to be soForces of the creative mind are unstoppable!And you think, All right, now peopleThey have finally woked upBut as soon as the trouble overWatch them take another napNobody is making merryOnly trotting scared of bossEverybody's making hurryFor some old forgotten causeBut one thing is surely eternalIt's condition of a manWho don't know where he is goingWho don't know where does he standWho's dream power is corked bottlePut away in dry dark placeWho's youth power is well buriedUnder propaganda wavesWho's dream life is in oppositionWith the life he leads todayWho's beaten down in believingIt just kinda goes this way!Oh no, it doesn't have to be soForces of the creative mind are unstoppable!\n\nA frightening youth movement evolves in Lebanon\u2019s Bekaa Valley. To the proximate north of the Jewish homeland goosesteps a graduating class of saluting young Muslim men adorned in disarming Boy Scout like uniforms, known as Mahdi Scouts, weaned on the fundamentalist Jew despising hatred of Hizbullah, pictured on the front page of the November 21st edition of the New York Times in an article entitled \u2018To Fuel Quest, Hizbullah Harnesses Youth Piety\u2019\n\nThe Shiite-dominated government in Iraq is driving out many leaders of Sunni citizen patrols, the groups of former insurgents who joined the American payroll and have been a major pillar in the decline in violence around the nation.\n\nI watched him speak yesterday- Dude does not inspire any confidence, that I can tell ya.

We're on our own in this insane world, so prepare yourselves\n\nChevron In the White HouseThe left will be so conflicted over Jones - since he is so pro-Pali, they should love him....and yet ..... because of the Chevron connection they object.... and here they are STILL missing the deeper points.... idiots.\n\nIn light of the Islamophobic and hate-filled programming on WBT 1110 AM\u2019s Jeff Katz show, a boycott is being called for all advertisers that have a financial relationship with Jeff Katz. Since the arrival of Jeff Katz at WBT there seems to be a move to profit off ignorance and hate at the expense of the Muslim Community. We are calling on people of faith, conscience and decency to boycott those that financially support this purveyor of hate. The boycott can be enacted by signing this petition on-line (or paper), and/or calling the businesses and not shopping with the advertisers. This petition is being sponsored by the Islamic Political Party of America (IPPA) and is inspired by the U.N.\u2019s \u2018Stop the Hate\u2019 campaign.\n\nTwo olive branches buried by a Minoan-era eruption of the volcano on the island of Thera (modern-day Santorini) have enabled precise radiocarbon dating of the catastrophe to 1613 BC, with an error margin of plus or minus 10 years, according to two researchers who presented conclusions of their previously published research during an event on Tuesday at the Danish Archaeological Institute of Athens.\n\nThothmes I became Pharaoh in Egypt and ruled 22 years. He first invaded Asia.\n\nA little over half of Israel's 215 years in Egypt had passed.\n\nAmram and Jochebed married. (Circa 1589 B.C.)\n\nMiriam was born to Amram and Jochebed. (Circa. 1580 B.C.) Miraim became a prophetess and leader in the Israelite exodus.\n\nThothmes II became Pharaoh of Egypt and reigned 13 years.\n\nAtlas, the Astronomer, came on the scene. (1588 B.C.)\n\nAaron was born to Amram and Jochebed. (1574 B. C.) Aaron lived 123 years and fathered four children. It was through Aaron's line that the Levitical priesthood was founded.\n\nHatasu became Queen of Egypt (daughter of Thothmes) and reigned 20 years. (It is said she wore men's clothing).\n\nMoses was born to Amarm and Jochebed and was adopted into the Egyptian royal court. At the age of 12 he was taken to live with the Egyptian royal family. (Troy, Athens and Thebes were founded during the days of Moses.) (1571 B.C.)\n\nCecrops, from Egypt, founded Athens. (1556 B.C.)\n\nThothmes III, The Great, became Pharoah of Egypt and reigned 40 years. As Egypt's greatest conqueror Thothmes III, became known as \"The Egyptian Alexander.\" He adorned Egypt with magnificent temples and works of art and erected the New York Obelisk. \"Egypt was at her climax, under Thothmes III. His conquests embraced the then known world of Arabia, Syria, Assyria, Babylonia, Phoenicia, Armenia, Asia Minor, the Isles of the Daniai (probably in the Archipelago), Cyprus, Ethiopia, Libya and Nubia.\" Dr. Birch.\n\nScamander founded the kingdom of Troy. Homer immortalized its history. (1546 B.C.)\n\nJoshua, son of Nun, of the tribe of Ephraim, was born. Joshua lived 110 years and became the leader of Israel after Moses' death. (1536 B.C.)\n\nJust weeks after President George W Bush signed the Order creating a new US military command dedicated to Africa, AFRICOM, events on the mineral-rich continent have erupted that suggest a major agenda of the incoming Barack Obama presidency to focus US resources, military and other, on dealing with the Democratic Republic of Congo, the oil-rich Gulf of Guinea, the oil-rich Darfur region of southern Sudan and increasingly the Somali \"pirate threat\" to sea lanes in the Red Sea and Indian Ocean.\n\nA cobalt bomb, a type of salted bomb, is a nuclear weapon originally proposed by physicist Le\u00f3 Szil\u00e1rd, who suggested that it would be capable of destroying all life on Earth. The weapon's tamper would be made of ordinary cobalt metal, which would be transmuted into the radioactive isotope 60Co, producing deadly fallout.\n\nUnder investigation is how American surveillance of the area, now under the control of the 82nd Airborne Division, failed to spot villagers entering the testing site with heavy vehicles to dismantle three of the poles, or towers, for scrap, leaving heavy tire tracks in the desert.\n\nOne of the cobalt capsules was found by American troops on Oct. 6 lying in the yard of a villager's house in Amiriya, less than 15 feet from the outdoor clay oven the family used to bake bread.\n\nThe second capsule was found partly buried about 75 feet from a house in Shamiya, just east of Amiriya and about 10 miles north of the nuclear testing site, in a position where it, too, would have been approached by family members and neighbors. Along with the capsules, parts of the giant testing poles were found, dismantled for scrap metal.\n\nWhy is the Department of Defense creating the command? Africa is growing in military, strategic and economic importance in global affairs. However, many nations on the African continent continue to rely on the international community for assistance with security concerns. From the U.S. perspective, it makes strategic sense to help build the capability for African partners, and organizations such as the Africa Standby Force, to take the lead in establishing a secure environment. This security will, in turn, set the groundwork for increased political stability and economic growth.\n\nEvery day blood is being spilled in the diamond fields of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and nobody in the international community is even talking about it. In the capital Kinshasa, the government is able to announce, unchallenged, its commitment to an international system aimed at breaking the links between the diamond trade and human rights violations,(2) while in Mbuji-Mayi, the hub of the country's diamond industry, serious abuses directly connected to the diamond trade are occurring on a daily basis, largely unchecked.\n\nSo, yesterday I told you that an ADDITIONAL 20K in troops would be stationed IN AMERICA shortly.... and yet no one reacted to that. I found that very interesting. ADDITIONAL because as I have told you many times before, \"Urban Warrior\" troops were deployed here in October to zero notice.... Here's a piece from CNN's Lou Dobbs Show on it followed by other stuff the video maker found pertinent:\n\nTwo years ago, I and others called attention to a dangerous provision slipped into an omnibus appropriation bill. The provision gave the President of the United States the unprecedented power to deploy the U.S. military for domestic duty within the United States as he sees fit.\n\nFor years I have warned that great evils often begin with the murder of Jews, and therefore non-Jews who dismiss Jew-hatred (aka anti-Semitism, aka anti-Zionism), will learn too late that Jew- and Israel-haters only begin with Jews but never end with them. When Israeli Jews were almost the only targets of Muslim terrorists, the world dismissed it as a Jewish or Israeli problem. Then it became an American and European and Filipino and Thai and Indonesian and Hindu problem.\n\nThe New York Times theorized that Chabad House may have been an \"accidental hostage scene.\" The BBC initially chose to hide the Jewish character of the target by describing it as just \"an office building.\" Al Jazeera refused to show Chabad House as the site of the carnage. Some Western media outlets unsympathetically labeled victims there as \"ultra-Orthodox\" or \"missionaries.\"\n\nContrary to these fantasies, the all-too-obvious truth is now being confirmed:\n\n* The Times of India reported that some of the terrorists, claiming to be Malaysian students, rented nearby space in order to scout out Chabad.\n\n* The Indian doctor who conducted the post-mortems related in a shaken voice that: \"Of all the bodies, the Israeli victims bore the maximum torture marks. It was clear that they were killed on the 26th [the first day of the attacks] itself. It was obvious that they were tied up and tortured before they were killed.\"\n\n* The only captured terrorist, Ajmal Kamal, confessed under interrogation that his fellow murderers were specifically ordered to target the Jews killed at Chabad.\n\nIt's not only close India-Israeli ties that the terrorists wanted to destroy. It's likely that Mumbai's age-old history of hospitality to Jews made the Nariman-Chabad House a strategic target.\n\nA Cooperation Framework on an important initiative in the field of health titled \"Reaching every mother and baby in the OIC with emergency care\" has been signed between the OIC General Secretariat and the USA today on December 1, 2008.\n\n11. Promote the U.N. as the only hope for mankind. If its charter is rewritten, demand that it be set up as a one-world government with its own independent armed forces. (Some Communist leaders believe the world can be taken over as easily by the U.N. as by Moscow. Sometimes these two centers compete with each other as they are now doing in the Congo.)\n\n\u201cThe United Nations was, in major part, America\u2019s creation,\u201d declared Susan Rice, President-elect Obama\u2019s nominee as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations at a news conference on Monday. This is true if you consider a communist and Soviet agent, U.N. founder Alger Hiss, to be truly \u201cAmerican.\u201d But that is quite a stretch. This kind of gaffe is never highlighted by our media because it is something that is repeated often by those attempting to justify continued U.S. participation in the corrupt United Nations.\n\nNeedless to say, Rice never mentioned that the U.N. is the \u201cHouse that Hiss built.\u201d But that is what it was, and what it remains.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, it is still infested with anti-American intelligence agents and foreign spies. Rice should read Comrade J, based on interviews with Sergei Tretyakov, the former Russian spymaster based at the U.N. The book describes the United Nations as a major base of espionage operations for Russia in the U.S.\n\nRice may be reluctant to read the book because of the fact that her Brookings Institution colleague, Strobe Talbott, is named in it as having been \u201ca special unofficial contact\u201d of the Russian intelligence agency, the SVR, when he was Deputy Secretary of State in the Clinton Administration. Talbott had been in charge of Russian affairs, and Rice had been Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs. They worked closely together, as Talbott concedes.\n\nMichelle Obama is to receive this \u00a320,000 thank you from her husband for her support during the election. The Harmony ring is made of rhodium - the world's most expensive metal --and encrusted with diamonds. It is being hastily made by Italian designer Giovanni Bosco in time for January's inauguration ceremony. Only about 25 tons of rhodium are mined each year, mostly in South Africa, and as a result its price is typically around \u00a35,000 an ounce.\n\nThe Flying Camel\n\nArebel's Diary\n\nBabbaZed Vinyl Cultessa 2012\n\nBabbaZee Repenthouse Pet 1982\n\nShould GOD reward you on your terms then, when you refuse to repent?
