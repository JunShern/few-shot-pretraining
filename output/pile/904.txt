    "text": "Duchess in Love\n\nGina was forced into marriage with the Duke of Girton at an age when she'd have been better off in a schoolroom than a ballroom. Directly after the ceremony, her handsome spouse promptly fled to the continent, leaving the marriage unconsummated and Gina quite indignant. Now, she is one of the most well-known ladies in London... living on the edge of scandal - desired by many men, but resisting giving herself to any one. Finally, Camden, the Duke of Girton, has returned home, to discover that his na\u00cfve bride has blossomed into the toast of the town.\n\nFun and entertaining listen!\n\nYes, because it was enjoyable and anyone who likes this genre will find it entertaining.\n\nFool for Love\n\nLady Henrietta Maclellan longs for the romantic swirl of a London season. But as a rusticating country maiden, she has always kept her sensuous nature firmly under wraps -- until she meets Simon Darby. Simon makes her want to whisper promises late at night, exchange kisses on a balcony, receive illicit love notes. So Henrietta lets her imagination soar and writes \"The Letter\" - which becomes shockingly public. Everyone supposes that he has written it to her, but the truth hardly matters in the face of the scandal to come if they don't marry at once.\n\nMy favorite Eloisa James! Yes, I've read them all.\n\nThis is an extremely humorous but still quite romantic book. James has a gift for sly humor and the careful observation of the not-always-so-delightf..Show More \u00bbul way in which children enliven our lives. I read this book a few years ago and liked it so much I wanted to hear it performed. Of course, the reader couldn't outperform the voices in my head but she came very close. Wonderful! There is an order to these books. Cam and Gina's story comes before this - Duchess in Love. Esme's story runs through these books -Duchess Quartet series. Although there is no Duchess at the heart of this story\n\nA Wild Pursuit: The Duchess Quartet, Book 3\n\nIt is whispered behind the fans of London's dowagers and in the corners of fashionable ballrooms that scandal follows willfully wild Lady Beatrix Lennox wherever she goes. Three years before, the debutante created a sensation by being found in a distinctly compromising position. Now, the town has branded her as unmarriageable, her family has called her a vixen, and Beatrix sees no reason not to go after what - and who - she wishes. And she wants Stephen Fairfax-Lacy, the handsome Earl of Spade.\n\nBIG Disappointment\n\n1. A better reader who wouldn't make all the females sound like snobs or prostitutes.2. The story got bogged down right at the beginning with 5 chapt..Show More \u00bbers devoted to conversations between snobbish women at parties talking about how to seduce men or cheat on their husbands.3. A smaller age difference between the protagonists (23 years is way too much to take seriously let alone get invested in the outcome of the romance).\n\nYour Wicked Ways\n\nHelene, the Countess Godwin, knows there is nothing more unbearably tedious than a virtuous woman. After all, she's been one for ten long years while her scoundrel of a husband lives with strumpets and causes scandal after scandal. So she decides it's time for a change - she styles her hair in the newest, daring mode, puts on a shockingly transparent gown, and goes to a ball like Cinderella, hoping to find a prince charming to sweep her off her feet...and into his bed."
