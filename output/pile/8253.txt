    "text": "The cardiologists say the reviews of their work did not accurately reflect the care they provided, and HCA says the reviews \u201care not, by any means, definitive,\u201d according to an e-mailed response by the company. HCA says it took whatever steps were necessary to improve patient care. It also said \u201csignificant actions were taken to investigate areas of concern, to bring in independent reviewers, and to take action where necessary.\u201d\n\nDetails about the procedures and the company\u2019s knowledge of them are contained in thousands of pages of confidential memos, e-mail correspondence among executives, transcripts from hearings and reports from outside consultants examined by The Times, as well as interviews with doctors and others. A review of those communications reveals that rather than asking whether patients had been harmed or whether regulators needed to be contacted, hospital officials asked for information on how the physicians\u2019 activities affected the hospitals\u2019 bottom line.\n\nHCA denies its decisions at these hospitals were motivated by financial considerations, but rather \u201cdemonstrate the strong focus we have on quality patient care.\u201d The company also says that more than 80 percent of its hospitals are in the top 10 percent of government rankings for quality.\n\nAlthough HCA has hospitals in about 20 states from California to Virginia and Alaska to Texas, Florida, with its large older population, is a critical and growing market for hospital chains and especially for HCA. HCA\u2019s Florida hospitals provide about 20 percent of the company\u2019s revenue.\n\nThe need to root out Medicare fraud \u2014 billing for unnecessary procedures, for example \u2014 is high for all hospitals. In 2003, Tenet Healthcare agreed to pay $54 million to settle allegations that unnecessary cardiac procedures were being performed over six years and billed to Medicare and Medicaid at one of its hospitals in California, Redding Medical Center.\n\nBut the pressure is even greater for HCA. In 2000, the company reached one of a series of settlements involving a huge Medicare fraud case with the Justice Department that would eventually come to $1.7 billion in fines and repayments. The accusations, which primarily involved overbilling, occurred when Rick Scott, now the governor of Florida, was the company\u2019s chief executive. He was removed from the post by the board but was never personally accused of wrongdoing.\n\nAs part of the settlement with the federal regulators, HCA signed a 97-page Corporate Integrity Agreement that extended through late 2008. It detailed what had to be reported to authorities and provided for stiffer penalties if HCA failed to do so."
