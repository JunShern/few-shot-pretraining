That means while he has even a single cell alive, he can regenerate from it. This already happened once. A single cell will re-create his skeleton, muscles, and skin.\nThat means a single cell knows how Wolverine is, and every cell retains his \"blueprint\" so to speak. \nIn your case, I'm guessing that would also mean his body would pull itself together. The bone would adjust to the right place, and the muscle and skin heal shut. But this raise worm-split-in-half questions.\nI'm discussing Wolverine at the peak of his mutant powers. It's usual for his powers to vary greatly from author to author. Hulk split Wolverine in half once, and threw his legs hundreds of miles away. In that universe, Wolverine had to crawl over to them to fuse and heal his lower body.\n\n"
