The defendant's attorney, prayed a rule might be granted for security for costs, the plaintiff residing in New York. Moylan, objected, that the motion came too late, after the cause had been marked for trial.\n\n\n2\nBut, By the Court: It is never too late to grant the rule, when it will not delay the trial.\n\n\n3\nRule granted.\n\n"
