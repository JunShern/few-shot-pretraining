    "text": "Worlds away from ordinary: The life and art of Octavia Butler\n\nJulia Keller, Tribune cultural criticCHICAGO TRIBUNE\n\nShe was living proof of the Oscar Wilde aphorism: \"All of us are lying in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars.\"\n\nOctavia E. Butler, 58, who died last weekend, grew up black and poor and minus any sort of early encouragement for her literary ambitions. \"Honey,\" an aunt once told her, as Butler recollected in a 1995 essay, \"Negroes can't be writers.\"\n\nYet Butler -- good for her, good for us -- didn't listen. The Seattle-based author became a popular and critically acclaimed writer of science fiction -- a genre in which, for a very long time, a female author was about as welcome as a scratch on a telescope lens. Thus she overcame a daunting range of obstacles, from poverty to prejudice, without ever taking her eye off the stars.\n\nAnd her sudden death leaves a terrible void, because Butler's talents were iridescently unique. In books such as \"Kindred\" (1979), \"Parable of the Sower\" (1993) and her most recent novel, \"Fledgling\" (2005), she intertwined present-day problems such as racism, misogyny and economic injustice with themes familiar to science fiction fans: time travel, interplanetary exploration, the creation of utterly plausible alternative universes. Her prose is supple and refreshingly colloquial, her characters beautifully conceived and accessible.\n\nTo read the first sentence of an Octavia E. Butler novel -- the \"E\" is for \"Estelle\" -- is to be drawn instantly into the enchanted realm of a superb storyteller, one whose message of tolerance and understanding and self-respect was never intrusive or heavy-handed. She brought the lightest of touches to the most profound of topics: human destiny.\n\nDuring a book tour last October to promote \"Fledgling\" -- a scintillating novel about a black female vampire -- Butler gave the keynote address at the 15th annual Gwendolyn Brooks Conference on Black Literature and Creative Writing at Chicago State University. It was a rare public appearance for the author, who once wrote that her looks -- she grew to be 6 feet tall before her 15th birthday and, friends say, was always embarrassed by her crooked teeth -- made her \"want to disappear\" throughout her childhood. \"I believed I was ugly and stupid, clumsy, and socially hopeless,\" Butler added.\n\n`Gracious and very humble'\n\nTo her Chicago audience, however, she seemed radiant. \"She was gracious and very humble, very kind. A joy to be around,\" recalled Quraysh Ali Lansana, director of the Gwendolyn Brooks Center. \"She was very much a recluse and we were very happy and honored when she consented to attend the conference.\n\n\"I feel very fortunate we were able to invite her, specifically in light of her sudden and tragic death,\" the director continued. \"She reminded me a great deal of Miss [Gwendolyn] Brooks, in terms of her spirit -- her openness and ability to listen, to really listen to folks. She's achieved such stature, but she was able to listen and interact with real sincerity.\"\n\nStature, indeed: In 1995 Butler received the MacArthur Fellowship nicknamed the \"genius grant.\" She won the 2000 Nebula Award -- the Oscar in the world of science-fiction scribes -- for her novel \"Parable of the Talents,\" along with many other writing awards.\n\nBut the plaudits came after long years of struggle in stubborn obscurity, as Butler often recounted in interviews and essays. She was born to an impoverished family in southern California; her father, who died when Butler was small, shined shoes for a living, and her mother was employed as a domestic.\n\nAll she wanted to do, Butler said, was write. \"I pecked my stories out two-fingered on the Remington portable typewriter my mother had bought me. I had begged for it when I was ten,\" she recalled in an essay called \"Positive Obsession\" that details her early years. \"[But] Who was I anyway? Why should anyone pay attention to what I had to say?\n\n\"I took classes taught by an elderly woman who wrote children's stories. She was polite about the science fiction and fantasy that I kept handing in, but she finally asked in exasperation, `Can't you write anything normal?'\"\n\nFortunately, the answer was \"No.\" Butler went her own way, following her own star, living on beans and potatoes during the lean years before her work caught fire commercially. As a black woman writing science fiction, she had to fight not one but two stereotypes -- only white males had succeeded in the genre -- and Butler fought in the best possible way: By writing extraordinary books that transmuted the pain of being an outsider into lyrical narratives of other worlds and future times.\n\nTallest in the class\n\n\"At school I was always taller than the rest of my class,\" Butler said in an essay that aired on National Public Radio in 2001. \"I was different. And even in the earliest grades, I got pounded for it. I learned that five and six-year-old kids have already figured out how to be intolerant.\"\n\nButler moved to Seattle in 1999, after nursing her mother through the latter's terminal illness, and lived alone amid her books. She didn't drive, instead becoming a fixture on Seattle buses, and made only sporadic public appearances. Reportedly she suffered from high blood pressure and other ailments; leaving her house on Friday, Feb. 24, she fell and hit her head. She died the next day in a local hospital.\n\nIn his blog, fellow science fiction writer Neil Gaiman mused, \"I didn't know Octavia Butler well -- we met at the Conference on the Fantastic in the Arts in Florida and we ate together and talked, and she was incredibly tall and wise and imposing ... but I loved her books and somehow thought of her as a permanent presence, although nobody ever is.\"\n\nButler often described herself as \"a hermit living in a large city; a pessimist if I'm not careful; a student, endlessly curious; a feminist; an African-American; a former Baptist; and an oil and water combination of ambition, laziness, insecurity, certainty and drive.\"\n\nIn an interview two years ago, she added this to the self-portrait: \"I'm a 56-year-old writer who can remember being a 10-year-old writer, and who expects someday to be an 80-year-old writer.\"\n\n- - -\n\n`Caught between terror and joy'\n\nI'm learning to fly, to levitate myself. No one is teaching me. I'm just learning on my own, little by little, dream lesson by dream lesson. ... I've had many lessons, and I'm better at flying than I used to be. I trust my ability more now, but I'm still afraid. I can't quite control my directions yet.\n\nI lean forward toward the doorway. ... And I lean into the air, straining upward, not moving upward, but not quite falling down either. Then I do begin to move, as though to slide on the air drifting a few feet above the floor, caught between terror and joy."
