    "text": "NPR interviews the head of California\u2019s community college system, who is arguing in favor of eliminating Algebra as a course requirement. The reason? Algebra is too hard for minorities.\n\nAlgebra is one of the biggest hurdles to getting a high school or college degree \u2014 particularly for students of color and first-generation undergrads.\n\nIt is also the single most failed course in community colleges across the country. So if you\u2019re not a STEM major (science, technology, engineering, math), why even study algebra?\n\nThat\u2019s the argument Eloy Ortiz Oakley, chancellor of the California community college system, made today in an interview with NPR\u2019s Robert Siegel.\n\nAt American community colleges, 60 percent of those enrolled are required to take at least one math course. Most \u2014 nearly 80 percent \u2014 never complete that requirement.\n\nOakley is among a growing number of educators who view intermediate algebra as an obstacle to students obtaining their credentials \u2014 particularly in fields that require no higher level math skills.\n\nTheir thinking has led to initiatives like Community College Pathways, which strays away from abstract algebra to engage students in real-world math applications. \u2026\n\nWhat are you proposing?\n\nWhat we\u2019re proposing is to take an honest look at what our requirements are and why we even have them. So, for example, we have a number of courses of study and majors that do not require algebra. We want to take a look at other math pathways, look at the research that\u2019s been done across the country and consider math pathways that are actually relevant to the coursework that the student is pursuing.\n\nYou are facing pressure to increase graduation rates \u2014 only 48 percent graduate from California community colleges with an associate\u2019s degree or transfer to a four-year institution within six years. As we\u2019ve said, passing college algebra is a major barrier to graduation. But is this the easy way out? Just strike the algebra requirement to increase graduation rates instead of teaching math more effectively?\n\nI hear that a lot and unfortunately nothing could be farther from the truth. Somewhere along the lines, since the 1950s, we decided that the only measure of a student\u2019s ability to reason or to do some sort of quantitative measure is algebra. What we\u2019re saying is we want as rigorous a course as possible to determine a student\u2019s ability to succeed, but it should be relevant to their course of study. There are other math courses that we could introduce that tell us a lot more about our students.\n\nDo you buy the argument that there are just some forms of reasoning \u2014 whether it\u2019s graphing functions or solving quadratic equations that involve a mental discipline \u2014 that may never be actually used literally on the job, but may improve the way young people think?\n\nThere\u2019s an argument to be made that much of what we ask students to learn prepares them to be just better human beings, allows them to have reasoning skills. But again, the question becomes: What data do we have that suggests algebra is that course? Are there other ways that we can introduce reasoning skills that more directly relate to what a student\u2019s experience in life is and really helps them in their program of study or career of choice?\n\nA lot of students in California community colleges are hoping to prepare for a four-year college. What are you hearing from the four-year institutions? Are they at ease with you dropping the requirement? Or would they then make the students take the same algebra course they\u2019re not taking at community college?\n\nThis question is being raised at all levels of higher education \u2014 the university level as well as the community college level. There\u2019s a great body of research that\u2019s informing this discussion, much of it coming from some of our top universities, like the Dana Center at the University of Texas, or the Carnegie Foundation. So there\u2019s a lot of research behind this and I think more and more of our public and private university partners are delving into this question of what is the right level of math depending on which major a student is pursuing.\nAnd there are people writing about concepts of numeracy that may be different from what people have been teaching all this time. Do you have in mind a curriculum that would be more useful than intermediate algebra?\n\nWe are piloting different math pathways within our community colleges. We\u2019re working with our university partners at CSU and the UC, trying to ensure that we can align these courses to best prepare our students to succeed in majors. And if you think about it, you think about the use of statistics not only for a social science major but for every U.S. citizen. This is a skill that we should have all of our students have with them because this affects them in their daily life. \u2026\n\nRates of failure in algebra are higher for minority groups than they are for white students. Why do you think that is? Do you think a different curriculum would have less disparate results by ethnic or racial group?\n\nFirst of all, we\u2019ve seen in the data from many of the pilots across the country that are using alternative math pathways \u2014 that are just as rigorous as an algebra course \u2014 we\u2019ve seen much greater success for students because many of these students can relate to these different kinds of math depending on which program of study they\u2019re in. They can see how it works in their daily life and how it\u2019s going to work in their career.\n\nThe second thing I\u2019d say is yes, this is a civil rights issue, but this is also something that plagues all Americans \u2014 particularly low-income Americans. If you think about all the underemployed or unemployed Americans in this country who cannot connect to a job in this economy \u2014 which is unforgiving of those students who don\u2019t have a credential \u2014 the biggest barrier for them is this algebra requirement. It\u2019s what has kept them from achieving a credential.\n\nFrom the perspective of the Left, colleges are there to supply credentials which are tickets to comfortable, well-paying positions in Society. Results must be equal, so if some groups are having trouble earning those credentials, it is necessary to grease the skids. The goal is not education; the goal is credentials.\n\nGoneWithTheWind\n\nThere is no good reason to require algebra or even English composition for community college students. The actual reason is because the teachers get to decide and the teachers for these course need students to keep their jobs.\n\nThere is a part of me who believes that every four year college graduate be required to not only take algebra but also two years of calculus. My only reason to justify this is that there are so many \u201cbasketweaving\u201d degrees out there that it demeans the value of a college degree. So my feeling is; fine, get a degree in woman\u2019s studies but also complete real college level classes to justify the diploma.\n\nIf you\u2019re only ever going to learn one \u201cserious\u201d mathematics course for a life outside of STEM, a good argument could be made that statistics is a better tool than algebra. Statistics would convey a level of mathematical literacy to many more people, and be of far more daily utility, than algebra.\n\nGoneWithTheWind\n\nPerhaps true\u2026 But statistics is useful for gamblers and liars. I can tell you all you need to know about statistics and save you the time of a college course. Almost all statistics that is touted/printed and used to make a point is either false or the results aren\u2019t even significant. 57% of statistics is wrong and the rest is made up on the spot.\n\nJohn\n\nI agree with the comment about statistics as being more useful, but, having studied statistics, I doubt you\u2019d make much of a dent on the young skulls full of mush you will encounter most of the time. Statistics is conceptually difficult, much more so than the mostly mechanical aspect of algebra.\n\nMy view is that much of one\u2019s school experience is not about the content, it\u2019s about proving that you can learn and do a difficult thing, that you have the temperament, ambition, and work ethic to get through these trials successfully. I would not be interested in hiring people in any capacity who eschewed math because it\u2019s \u201ctoo hard.\u201d\n\nDick the Butcher\n\nJK Brown\n\nThe reason algebra is hard for many students is that it is the first exposure to abstract thinking. The strange thing is that many math teachers don\u2019t seem to realize this. This limits their ability to help guides student through this transformation of their thinking.\n\nHow do you learn statistics using letters and symbols in place of numbers when you\u2019ve not learned algebra which is the mathematics based on using letters and other general symbols in place of numbers in formulas and equations?\n\nBurke\n\nIt\u2019s staggering to read some of the comments above in this site \u2013 I would expect to see them at NYT, or Salon, whatever.\nI\u2019m from a generation that decreed there was \u201cno good reason\u201d to learn Latin (not to say Greek). Well, suffice to say that \u201cminor writers\u201d of all kinds alive then (C. S. Lewis, P. G. Wodehouse, Anthony Powell, Raymond Chandler et al.) would be \u2013 with good reason \u2013 considered genius, today.\nNo wonder Muslims despise the West. And, since I have no children (\u201cI left to nobody the legacy of our misery\u201d, as was said by the greatest Brazilian writer, and one of the greatest in any idiom, Machado de Assis \u2013 a genius and, by the way, a bastard son of a white man and a black woman, who never had the help of anyone our anybody but himself); since I have no children, as I was saying, they are welcome to it.\n\nbob sykes\n\nA great many of these minority students have IQ\u2019s in the 80\u2019s, and are only marginally educable, and only for simple manual tasks at that.\n\nAs to the relative importance of probability and statistics to algebra, I would have to agree. But, you cannot understand statistics without partial differential equations, and for that you need algebra, geometry, some number theory, et al.\n\nStatistics is one of the most subtle and difficult of all subjects, and the proof of that is that Ph. D. scientists at major research universities like MIT routinely screw up their statistical analyses. A large majority of papers in refereed journals contain statistical analyses that do not in any way support the researchers\u2019 conclusions."
