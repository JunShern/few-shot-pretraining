    "text": "Let\u2019s start with two photographs.\n\nThe first was shot by me in China\u2019s Hunan Province. It shows a warehouse that contains roughly 5,000 old locally-collected televisions awaiting recycling. This photo only captures a portion of what is a big inventory, and a big operation. Every day more arrive. Most people outside of China have never heard of this place, mostly because it is indoors, and difficult for journos and activists to gain access to.\n\nNext, a photo tagged \u201ce-Waste \u2013 field of computers\u201d that I came across while looking at a Google map of Agbogbloshie, a suburb of Accra, Ghana that everyone from the Guardian to Motherboard has called the world\u2019s \u201cbiggest\u201d or \u201clargest\u201d e-waste dump.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing good or right in the Agbogbloshie photo. The pollution it depicts is nasty. But if you can get past the shock and evaluate the volume of e-waste in the image, it\u2019s not much \u2013 especially compared to what we see in the China photo. Indeed, despite the parade of Agbogbloshie slideshows posted by media outlets over the years, there\u2019s a curious dearth of images showing large volumes of e-waste at the site. Rather, the genre is almost exclusively devoted to pictures of laborers, oftentimes not even processing waste \u2013 see this useless and exploitative New York Times slideshow, or this more recent one from Motherboard. My long-standing suspicion has been that there aren\u2019t any great volumes of e-waste at Agbogbloshie, and that most of the journalists and photographers who go there \u2013 having had no experience with developing world recycling \u2013 document their shock, but not what\u2019s actually happening, frankly because they don\u2019t know better.\n\nThis matters. Agbogbloshie has become a global symbol for what\u2019s alleged to be a vast and growing environmental problem: the export of e-waste from the developed world to West Africa. Yet in recent years, academic and UN-sponsored research has shown that the problem is far more complex \u2013 and, in all respects, smaller \u2013 than what\u2019s being depicted. In other words \u2013 we\u2019re not talking about the world\u2019s largest e-waste dump.\n\nSo what I\u2019m going to do is show how somebody with actual experience reporting in and around the global recycling industry \u2013 especially in the developing world \u2013 looks at Agbogbloshie. My background is that of a journalist who has been writing about and photographing the industry for 15 years, and has visited hundreds of recycling facilities, especially in the developing world. In March and April, I visited Accra.\n\nThere are two possible meanings for \u201cbiggest.\u201d Let\u2019s start out with scale. In April, Jakob Schiller at Wired described the areas as follows: \u201cA former wetland turned slum, the kilometer-long stretch of land is a toxic graveyard of computers, refrigerators and other trash.\u201d\n\nThis description, and the many, many others that like to describe Abgobloshie as \u201cvast\u201c, is false (I\u2019ve reached out to Schiller for his source \u2013 did he visit? \u2013 but he hasn\u2019t responded). Agbogbloshie is, in fact, small. Its street frontage is roughly 200 meters, and it extends back roughly 450 meters. But I\u2019d estimate that only about half of it is actually utilized; overall land use is extremely inefficient, especially for a scrap zone home to perhaps 200 small businesses. Below, I\u2019ve pasted a Google map showing the outlines (click to enlarge). If you want to know more about what\u2019s actually going on in there, here\u2019s a geo-tagged map showing various activities by the fantastic folks at the Agbogbloshie Makerspace Project. Note that the geo-tagged map shows activity to the left of what I show below \u2013 that\u2019s because the geo-tagged version hasn\u2019t been updated since the local government shut down those businesses in late March (mostly plastic recyclers). That\u2019s right, Agbogbloshie is shrinking.\n\nIn human terms, that means you can walk from one end of Agbogbloshie to the other end in a couple of minutes (which I did, several times). If, like me, you spend time in the world of globalized recycling, that\u2019s nothing special size-wise, equivalent to a large \u2013 but not unusually so \u2013 scrap yard in the U.S. or EU, and much smaller than most landfills. Elsewhere in Africa, there are far larger recycling and dump sites (Dandora outside of Nairobi comes to mind), and in Asia they\u2019re even bigger (Guiyu is an actual town). That\u2019s why, five minutes after taking my first step in Agbogbloshie, I found myself utterly bewildered, and turning to my companion and guide to ask: \u201cThis is IT?\u201d It was.\n\nSo what, then, are we to make of images, such as the one below (taken by me), that seem to suggest a much bigger space, extending out into the horizon?\n\nIf you look at the above satellite view of Agbogbloshie, you\u2019ll note quite a bit of empty space abutting the site \u2013 much of that is open fields and a city dump. It is not, however, related to the recycling of electronics. For a photographer, though, it\u2019s a great backdrop (I\u2019ll get to the question of what\u2019s being burnt, shortly).\n\nSince we\u2019re on scale, I\u2019d like to touch on a related point. Is Agbogbloshie a slum? Yes and no. Yes, in that the tens of thousands of people who live in the area do not live well. No, in the sense that it\u2019s primarily a traffic-choked industrial zone home to \u2013 among other businesses) a Pepsi bottling plant directly across the street from the scrap zone (the Pepsi plant\u2019s manager, according to this source, doesn\u2019t appear to want anything to do with its recycling neighbors), car dealerships, a brewery, a vegetable market (specializing in yams and onions) and hundreds if not thousands of small workshops devoted to making everything from cooking pots to electrical transformers. Here, for example, is the traffic heading into Agbobloshie.\n\nNote the load of yams definitely not bound for the recycling zone. And here\u2019s what the actual frontage directly outside of the scrapping zone looks like.\n\n\u201cAgbogbloshie,\u201d the scrap zone, is entered via one of two entrances abutted by the onions. Here\u2019s one of them.\n\nThis image brings me to the question of volume. Specifically, how much e-waste can be jammed into a 200 x 450 meter space in the middle of one of Africa\u2019s busiest, most traffic-choked cities?\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at that photo, above, again.You don\u2019t need to be an expert in international shipping and logistics to know that this driveway, and the mud/dirt road that connects to it, is unlikely to support a lot of traffic, much less the frequent loading and unloading of shipping containers and other means of transporting e-waste. And, in fact, during my time at the site, there weren\u2019t any shipping containers flowing into the site. Rather, the primary means of delivering scrap \u2013 not just e-waste \u2013 was this one:\n\nAt any given time, there are perhaps 10 to 20 men (always men) pulling these four wheelers. The scrap they carry mostly comes from within Accra itself, sold or given to them because the devices no longer function. The closest port \u2013 Tema \u2013 is roughly 21 miles away, and though these men are incredibly fit, it\u2019s unlikely that they\u2019d find it worthwhile to traipse a near Marathon distance for the meager profits from three microwaves, four televisions, and a transmission case. To be fair, I also saw scrap delivered in taxis, and pickup trucks, and one rickety flatbed. But shipping containers? Never.\n\nSo how much scrap ends up in Agbogbloshie every day? The only study that\u2019s ever tackled the question systematically was published in 2011 (funded by the European Commission, Norway, the United Kingdom, and the Dutch Recyclers Association, and coordinated by the Secretariat of the Basel Convention), and it found that \u2013 in 2009 \u2013 Ghana (not just Accra) imported 215,000 tons of used electronics. That sounds bad until you read the kicker: of that imported electronics, 70% was still functioning and usable, and the other 20% could be repaired.\n\nAnd it was repaired. Indeed, Ghana, like much of West Africa, is a major hub for the re-use, repair, and refurbishment of used goods from around the world \u2013 everything from furniture to mobile phones. Drive around any city in Ghana, and you\u2019ll see entrepreneurs who\u2019ve imported and refurbished used goods (increasingly from China), and now offer them for sale to the large swath of the population that can\u2019t afford new (the wonderful Yepoka Yeebo recently produced an excellent photo essay on this industry for Roads and Kingdoms). There are, without exaggeration, thousands of stalls like this around the country:\n\nAnd, for that matter, like this (yes, there are markets in everything, including used chairs, coffee makers, and waffle irons):\n\nSo let\u2019s do some math. The UN\u2019s Solving the E-Waste Problem [StEP] initiative estimates that global e-waste generation in 2014 was 46.8 million short tons [41.8 million metric tons]. Let\u2019s assume, for the sake of argument, that the amount of e-waste imported into Ghana tripled since 2009 (probably not, but I can feel the gaze of my critics), to 645,000 tons. If 90% of that is re-usable and/or repairable, that means 64,500 metric tons \u2013 or 72240 short tons \u2013 is not usable a.k.a. it\u2019s e-waste needing to be recycled.\n\nIn other words: .15% of global e-waste flows into Ghana (not just Accra and Agbogbloshie) under this calculation, making a rather thin case for \u201cthe world\u2019s largest digital dump.\u201d\n\nAnd that figure is undoubtedly too high.\n\nHow much too high? And what do the scrappers say? Around Agbogbloshie, I was told that the scrappers recycled between 30 and 50 televisions and computer monitors per day (monitors are the heaviest component of the e-waste stream). I checked with some folks I know in the monitor recycling business, and they told me that 50 lbs per monitor is a good average. So, as a safe conservative estimate, let\u2019s say that Agbogbloshie recycles one short ton of monitors per day, and 365 tons per year.\n\nNow, it\u2019s not hard to do this calculation (thanks to Robin Ingenthron at the Good Point Recycling blog for doing a version of it first). But, for some reason, the media organizations that insist on sending photographers to document Agbogbloshie never bother to look up the 2011 study, or do the calculation. Rather, they just say whatever sounds most shocking. For example, as far back as 2008 (to be fair, pre-study), PBS Frontline claimed that \u201chundreds of million of tons\u201d of e-waste arrive at Agbogbloshie annually (which would make e-waste one of the world\u2019s most shipped manufactured goods)! Most news organizations, however, are a bit more responsible, and either hedge their bets by sticking to \u201cbiggest\u201d and \u201clargest\u201d or \u2013 as in the case of Gizmodo \u2013 show a bit more courage (though not more sourcing) and say \u201cmillions of tons.\u201d None of this is even remotely true.\n\nSo let\u2019s go back to the beginning of this post. Here\u2019s what roughly 5000 monitors look like (there\u2019s more both to the right and left that didn\u2019t fit my frame).\n\nAnd here are a few images of what Agbogbloshie \u2013 dimensions of 200 x 450 meters \u2013 looks like on a weekday.\n\nOf course, there is one unanswered question. If not e-waste, what on Earth is being recycled under these deplorable conditions? First, there is e-waste processed at Agbogbloshie \u2013 I saw it \u2013 but not much. Instead, as the above photo hints, on a volume basis Abgobloshie is a vehicle recycling facility, where whole vehicles are dismantled by hand, primarily, and the various components are then sorted and sold for recycling or further processing. It starts like this:\n\nAnd like this \u2013 note the young man pushing the cart piled with car doors and other parts.\n\nAnd one of the product streams it produces is stuff like this (note the engine block, transmission case, and other auto scrap), that can be sold as metal.\n\nUnfortunately, if you don\u2019t have the proper equipment, automobiles are just as difficult, if not polluting, to recycle as old electronics. Ghana doesn\u2019t have the equipment. This creates problems with two waste streams. First, the wires and cables that are part of our ever-increasingly computerized automobiles. And second, the tires.\n\nThis brings me back to the question of what to make of all those photos of fires and burning scrap at Agbogbloshie. Here\u2019s a photo of a typical, just-completed burn scene at Agbogbloshie. It caused a lot of smoke, a lot of fire, and a lot of coughing (mine included).\n\nAnd here\u2019s a close-up of what was burnt. That\u2019s right, tires.\n\nNow, I can\u2019t tell you that I know what percent of what\u2019s burnt at the site is tires, and what\u2019s everything else (getting to that). But I can tell you that the tire burn area takes up 80% of the space devoted to burning. And it\u2019s nasty. But because Ghana\u2019s automobile recycling sector is very undeveloped, there isn\u2019t much alternative (tires are notorious breeding grounds for mosquitoes, which in Ghana \u2013 where malaria and yellow fever are endemic \u2013 is unacceptable).\n\nMeanwhile, further down the burn area, workers torch 10 lb bundles of wire and cable that are outsourced for burning (to get rid of the insulation) to them by businesses within Agbogbloshie. Anyone who knows scrap metal \u2013 or the inside of a computer or television \u2013 should be able to tell right away that these bundles contain far more than wires from an old ThinkPad or VCR.\n\nThey contain, rather, wiring from a broad range of electrical goods, including \u2013 and primarily \u2013 automobile harnesses (the wiring hub within and beneath your car).\n\nI want to be clear. Just because it\u2019s automobile cabling \u2013 rather than ribbon cables from inside a PC \u2013 being burnt, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s ok. Pretty much nothing at Agbogbloshie qualifies as a best or even adequate practice when it comes to human health and the environment. They are, instead, the practices available to a small-scale recycling industry that functions on very little capital. That could and probably will change as some of the scrap dealers start making more money, and the government decides that it wants to improve Accra\u2019s air quality. But other groups \u2013 NGOs in particular \u2013 have other ideas about how to help Agbogbloshie, including bans on the export of repairable electronics from the developed world, and the installation of totally inappropriate equipment at the recycling site.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing. If you want to fix Agbogbloshie, you need to understand what\u2019s happening there. Calling it the world\u2019s biggest digital dump and erecting trade and even criminal barriers to prevent used electronics will only serve to deprive Ghanaians of access to affordable information technology, while doing nothing to prevent them from selling those cheap electronics to Agbogbloshie when they\u2019re done with them. And that won\u2019t be any time soon \u2013 Ghana\u2019s culture of use, repair, re-use, and further repair and re-use ensures that Ghanaians will utilize used electronics much longer than their original owners would ever have believed possible (ten-year-old functioning Windows 95 PCs are common throughout Ghana).\n\nUnderstanding Agbogbloshie as an electronics dump only serves to ensure that far bigger problems \u2013 such as what to do with Ghana\u2019s dead cars \u2013 won\u2019t get attention. What I fear is that my friends in the media, always looking for an interesting angle on \u201cthe tech story\u201d won\u2019t find Agbogbloshie as worthy of their attention if the problem turns out to be Toyotas and Fords, rather than Apples and Dells. If that\u2019s the case, they\u2019ve not only mis-served themselves, but also the good people of Agbogbloshie who are \u2013 ostensibly \u2013 the reason their workplace is worth photographing in the first place.\n\n[The May/June issue of Scrap Magazine includes a long feature \u2013 by me \u2013 touching on e-waste in Ghana and Kenya.
