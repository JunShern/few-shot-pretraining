This proved TOO big and I had to return it.\n\nI F\n\nnot quite right for me\n\nstrong fabric.good vintage shape.not the right shape for me.have found softer gentler fabric.has transparent section it's a nice extra as often this is filled in especially in larger cup or back sizes. don't think my breast form showed through\n\nFH\n\nPerfect fit\n\nAfter following the sizing guide carefully, I discovered I'm a 40A not 38B! This is my favourite replacement out of 4, it lifts and shapes without feeling too firm or frumpy. Thoroughly recommended.\n\nF D\n\nPerfect fit\n\nFits exactly as you'd expect\nLooks very natural with prosthesis\nEven though there's some pretty\nNetting/lace\n\nE M\n\nCSH\n\nI have three of these bras and I love the look, the fit and the comfort, however, soon after washing them the lining of the pockets started shredding from top to bottom.\n\nRita non wire soft bra by Coral AllwrightI'm pleased to have discovered this particular bra on the Amoena website. Following a single mastectomy I have at last found a bra that is comfortable fit and to wear because it sits well in position- no uncomfortable sliding up.\n\nSupportive even in larger sizes! by CLare GummettI usually buy the bras with the widest straps etc - which then \"creep\" into view when wearing the slightest deeper neckline - this bra is light enough not to do that, but supportive enough for my needs - I will be buying more of these!\n\nRita Non-wired soft Bra by JRExcellent and fitted perfect.\n\nGreat everyday bra by PGI have worn the Rita bra for several years. It's very comfortable, with adjustable straps. It gives good support (I am a 34B). It has a smooth finish so can be worn under t-shirts or tight-fitting tops. And it's very comfortable.\n\nRita bra by FTLovely product. However, just slightly tight for me, even though my usual size, so returned. Excellent returns process with pre paid address label included with product. Many thanks\n\nRita bra by MDNice fabric, well fitting, comfortable and smooth under my clothes.\n\nrita by J Ospoilt for choice bought two white and a black one great to find nice bras in large sizes\n\nA practical everyday bra by L HThis is a very comfortable bra which is great for wearing under tee shirts as it offers a good shape and support. There are no frills but it is pretty nevertheless.\n\nRita non-wired bra. by J LA very comfortable well fitting garment with comfortable straps and giving a nice shape. Thjs is my third purchase of this design, albeit in increasing sizes! Hope it is never discontinued.\n\nRita Non-wired soft bra by V SLovely to look at and lovely to wear. So comfortable and a great fit. I'm very pleased with my purchase. Fantastic delivery as well.\n\nrita non wired bra by BVI have found this bra to be one of the most comfortable bras from the whole range. I have bought many of these bras. it would be nice if they were in more colour choices\n\nNew Model - Same Comfort by JWI have used the Annabelle bra model (no longer available except in the USA) for several years. When I asked Amoena UK customer service what was a comparable model they recommended the Rita. Spot on. Comfortable from the first wearing.\n\nAnother successful Amoena purchase by Joan WastnidgeJasmine is my third Amoena bra and I was pleased with the first two but I love this one even more; it is so pretty, lovely fabric and a very good fit. My pre mastectomy bras were never as good as these. Thank you Amoena.\n\nJasmine Bra by Elaine WilsonExtremely comfortable considering I only had my surgery 2 weeks ago, although I do find it a little prices.\n\nLooks good by Christine StevensonA very pretty bra and a good fit, the only downside for me is the shoulder straps could be a little longer for extra adjustment,\nother than that very pleased with my purchase and would recommend it.\n\nGreat Bra by Pamela BowmanThe Jasmin Bra is very pretty and fits me perfectly. The centre front is a little higher than other styles and covers my operation site well. I would really like it if more styles could be cut like this one because then I would have more choice.\n\nLovely lacy style by Sandra WallerLovely lacy style and soft fabric. Very pleased with this bra.\n\nJasmin non-wired bra by Jill BembridgeThe Jasmin looks really pretty and fresh. It felt comfortable straight away and was a good fit. it is also comfortable if you are just wearing a \"softie\". I am really pleased with my purchase.\n\nExcellent buy by Margarett ClarkThis is a really soft bra that does not cut in like many others do. It is an excellent fit.\n\nJasmin non-wired soft bra by HSI love this bra which is available in an 36AA size and a perfect fit for me. It is very comfortable and nice and feminine.\nI really wish it was also available in other colours - a navy or black and a nice bright pink would be great!\n\nJasmin bra by EAI have bought this bra for the last few years,so comfortable,apart from the label on the back,it is such a pretty bra and fits perfectly , hope it is one that is still continues to be stocked.\n\nrepeat purchase by FCthis have been one of my favourite Bras for several years. Recently I have found the shoulder straps could be a little longer & the back fastening a little longer too to accommodate my Dowergers spine. Still a favourite though\n\nComfy by JPI have bought the this bra many times. Comfortable and very pretty. It wears and washes well. It is however a little pricey.\n\nSatisfaite by npTr\u00e8s bon produit envoy\u00e9 rapidement satisfaction 100%\n\nJasmin bra by pmI have had several Amoena bras over the years but this is my favourite by far! It is so pretty and very comfortable to wear. Would recommend it without hesitation! PM\n\nGood bra by CCMy favourite bra for 11 years! However, I'm disappointed that the previously all-cotton pockets are now part nylon. Please, Amoena, revert to the all-cotton pockets which were so much better for people like me who have a tendency to eczema.\n\nJasmin by RZThe most comfortable bra in the range and pretty too. I do try other styles but Jasmin is always in my collection. Thank you Amoena.\n\nA real favourite by L MThis is my third Jasmine bra. It looks great, is stylish and comfortable. It certainly wont be my last.\n\nPretty comfortable by D OThe bra is so light you'll hardly know you're wearing it but it's supportive too and, oh joy, it comes in AA fitting. One mark off for the label which I had to remove because my skin is ultra sensitive.\n\nVery comfortable by J SThis is a very snug fitting comfortably bra and looks lovely too.\n\nJasmin by J T The lightest Amoena bra I have tried so far which is great especially in the hot weather. It doesn't give quite as smooth a line under T Shirts as some other bras but fine under less close fitting tops.\n\nJasmin Bra by J H I have had several of these bras over the years and it is my bra of choice.\nOne slight problem is that the label inside the back can sometimes tickle!\n\nLovely and comfortable by M LJust bought this bra for the third time, very comfortable and pretty for every day use\n\nFavourite by E.BHave bought this bra for the last 12 years, but on finding I needed a larger size due to weight gain, have to put an extender on a 40A. Please make bigger sizes with A and AA cup for the smaller cup size ladies .\n\nPretty and comfortable by MBVery happy with this pretty, well fitting bra. I wish it was in nude or cream too. This is the best of all the Amoema bras I have purchased so far, and I would like it in several colours.\n\nExcellent by KCWonderful but only available in black and white more colours please....\n\nMrs. by Julie VeenemanI bought my first Isabel 16 years ago while I was recovering from a double mastectomy. I have never even tried on another bra since. It has changed only slightly over the years. It is feminine and very well made. Because it washes perfectly it is very easy care. I wear double prostheses and the camisole hugs my frame allowing me to feel secure knowing there is no gapping. The camisole portion is very well made and the lace looks as though it were made to peek from a V tshirt or a button front blouse. It has never stretched out or shown wear before the other sections of the bra. I recommend trying it on, because even if you find another comfortable bra this lacy camisole is a very basic wardrobe piece. I have even recommended it to friends who wouldn't use the pockets!!\n\nMrs. by Julie VeenemanI bought my first Isabel 16 years ago while I was recovering from a double mastectomy.
