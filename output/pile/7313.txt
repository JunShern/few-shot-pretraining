When try to copy a file and suddenly you want to cancel it or in my case I was try to write it over a network drive and I lost the connection. \n\nBut regardless what's the reason this annoying box just doesn't go away. Anyone know why this is happening? or How I can prevent such happen over and over again?\n\nA:\n\nNot sure why it happens, but I get it too. To get rid of this annoying dialog you need to kill explorer and restart it:\n\nfrom Task Manager, Processes tab, find explorer.exe and choose \"End Process\"\nstill in Task Manager, select File \u2192 New Task \u2192 type explorer \u2192 OK\n\nA:\n\nTry a copy program that handles exceptions better like TeraCopy or Unstoppable Copier. Both free, fast, and far more reliable than Windows' native copy.\nhttp://teracopy-portable.en.softonic.com/\nhttp://www.roadkil.net/program.php?ProgramID=29\n\n"
