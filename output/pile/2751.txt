    "text": "Mmo Game Guide, News, F&Q\n\nWho Is Kalandra In Path Of Exile\n\nWho is Kalandra In PoE? You may find nothing if you searched in the wiki/forum. Unlike poe items, it\u2019s never actually ever mentioned in any of the lore bits as to who Kalandra was. Prior to FoO, I would\u2019ve said that Kalandra was simply a talented thaumaturgist in Atziri\u2019s court, possibly even the maker of her many many mirrors that she kept in the throne room. There\u2019s no evidence for this but is kinda fits.\n\nkalandra\u2019s actually the name for the \u2018mirrored\u2019 world, a parallel universe to the one we know. Most trivial things are the same, like generic weapons. Some historically important events changed (why you cant mirror uniques) and some things are ever so slightly different. For example, in Kalandra, the templar wears pants. ONLY wears pants.\n\nI don\u2019t think she would have taken the new name when actually taking the throne but perhaps actually found immortality with (or without) Doryani and when the empire under her fell, she fled until she finished the rituals and turned into what we now encounter her as, an immortal demon queen.\n\nWith FoO, we get the twin brothers of Innocence and Sin who are opposites (reflections) of one another. Their mother has never been named, as far as I\u2019ve been able to find, but she is called the \u201cMother of Two\u201d in the third stained glass window lore. With this in mind, I\u2019ve somewhat swapped my opinion to her being their mother but it\u2019s speculative at best."
