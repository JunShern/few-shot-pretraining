Actually, I had heard about him before I even met him through reciprocal friends, and merely a quick description of him was enough to let me know that he was \u201cthe mens\u201d for me!\n\nEventually, the stars aligned and we met in person, and he was exactly how I imagined he would be. Now how often does a fantasy match reality so perfectly?\n\nNot only that, the chemistry was explosive. The dialogue flowed, the body language signals all checked, and our faces were almost ached from smiling so wide. I\u2019m a relationship expert, I write about humen for a living, I know what a guy \u201cin like\u201d looks like and this was it!\n\nAfter we parted from that magical first session, I floated home on a cloud. At last, the wait is over, dating is over, I found the guy for me! Never mind the fact that he didn\u2019t ask for my number or mention getting in touch with me, I was sure that he liked me, and that something magical was brewing.\n\nBut it didn\u2019t \u2026\n\nHmm, that\u2019s strange. Maybe he guessed I didn\u2019t like him? Or perhaps it\u2019s because I was getting shy and flustered and perhaps I merely wasn\u2019t giving enough green light signals. Or perhaps he\u2019s afraid of being rejected; I know that\u2019s a real fear for most men! And I entail, that would be so embarrassing for him because we have so many mutual friends \u2026 so perhaps he\u2019s just waiting until he knows for sure that I\u2019m interested. Yes! That has to be it. The next time I insure him, I will make sure my signals are clear and obvious.\n\nAbout a month or two afterward, we crossed tracks at a friend\u2019s birthday party. Never mind the fact that every time I appeared over at him he was heavily flirting with a different girl; I knew that I was different. I mean, I\u2019m so good at reading situations, that\u2019s what I do for a living! I can\u2019t be wrong about this.\n\nEventually, he swam my way through the sea of populations and again, explosive chemistry, flirty banter, outstretched smiles, this time he even gave me a high five that persisted route too long, so does that count as him holding my hand ??\n\nYes, this was happening, it was, I feel it. But it didn\u2019t.\n\nOK , now I\u2019m so confounded. This doesn\u2019t make any sense. Why isn\u2019t he asking me out? It must be because he doesn\u2019t want to build things weird, that he wants to be sure this will work out before he dives in. Oh! I know! Maybe he senses that I\u2019m \u201cthe one\u201d and that\u2019s really scary for a guy \u2026 so he\u2019s just processing what\u2019s going on.\n\nI spent many more months in the grips of intense disarrays. How do I crack his code? How do I get a relationship to happen? This is all so confusing!\n\nNow, whenever I would get stuck in an area concerning my love life it was doubly hard because I am a relationship expert by trade, it\u2019s what I do and I\u2019m good at it. But when faced with a problem I couldn\u2019t solve, well then I genuinely felt like an idiot and a fraud!\n\nI knew what I would tell a reader this situation, but my own sound advice just didn\u2019t seem to apply here. It simply feelings different.\n\nOK, long narrative short, a little while afterward I brought a friend of mine to a party that he also attended. He took one look at her and that was it. They engaged in heavy flirting, he immediately got her information, and he called and asked her on a date soon after. I literally felt like I had been knocked sideways. The next day I couldn\u2019t even walk straight-out, my whole world felt like it was tilted.\n\nAnd this is what girls always get wrong about men.\n\nWe think they\u2019re so confusing. We think it doesn\u2019t make any sense. We think they play games and send mixed messages. We don\u2019t understand why.\n\nBut really, we do. The problem is we don\u2019t want to admit the truth that\u2019s staring us in the face. We don\u2019t want to admit that a guy we like may not like us back, so we invent this whole narrative about how he actually does like us, and about all these menacing obstacles are getting in the way of building true love bloom.\n\nMen Aren\u2019t Complicated\n\nI know it voices shocking, I know it doesn\u2019t feel like this can possibly is correct to say, but it is! And once you really internalize this fact, your dating life will dramatically change. You can relax and stop stressing and building yourself crazy.\n\nWhen it comes to humen, the most obvious justification is usually the correct one. Feelings aren\u2019t facts. Just because something feels a certain way doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s the reality.\n\nYou can\u2019t interpret situations when you have a bias toward a certain outcome. This is main reason why I was so good at breaking down other people\u2019s relationship issues but always got tripped up when it came to my own love life. It\u2019s the reason most of us can solve our friend\u2019s relationship issues such as no problem, but remain utterly befuddled when it comes to our own lives.\n\nHere is the straight up truth: Man aren\u2019t complicated, female complicate them .\n\nI\u2019m not blaming the woman, but I will say we set ourselves through so much unnecessary heartbreak just because we don\u2019t want to accept that men are actually fairly simple and straightforward creatures.\n\nBut How Does He Feel About Me?\n\nBy far the most common questions I get are fluctuations of figuring out how a guy feels \u2026\n\n\u201cHe texts me from time to time, but we never actually hang out\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s truly flirty when we find one another, and said I\u2019m the coolest girl he knows, so why isn\u2019t he asking me out? \u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been to be together for months, but he won\u2019t make it official\u2026.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe always watches my Instagram and Snapchat stories, and he likes my scenes! What does that mean ???? \u201d\n\nIt entails he is kind of interested in you, but doesn\u2019t want a relationship with you.\n\nGuys don\u2019t play games, they don\u2019t try to hide interest, they don\u2019t speak in code, and they aren\u2019t trying to confuse you. Why is it so confusing? Again, because we don\u2019t want to accept the truth and we all want to think we\u2019re the exception.\n\nWhat women always get wrong about humen is believing they\u2019re evil or complicated or commitment-phobes or players. But the majority of cases this just isn\u2019t the case.\n\nMen usually demonstrate you exactly who they are. They may not inevitably come right out and say the words, but you\u2019ll always watch the truth when you can honestly look for it. And if a man does ever come right out and tell you he doesn\u2019t want to be in a relationship, believe him . Again, this isn\u2019t him performing some voodoo trap on you and trying to get you to like him more or prove your worth by showing what an amazing girlfriend you would be.\n\nIf a guy isn\u2019t stimulating it obvious to you that he likes you, it\u2019s because he doesn\u2019t like you that much. If he isn\u2019t committing to you, it\u2019s because he doesn\u2019t want to. If he\u2019s treating you like a loot call, it\u2019s because he doesn\u2019t want a relationship that runs any deeper than that.\n\nDon\u2019t delude yourself or adopt a man-hating position. Watch a situation for what it is, and accept that humen merely aren\u2019t that complicated.\n\nAnd in case you\u2019re wondering, it didn\u2019t work up between that guy and my friend and she was utterly devastated( and ok fine, I was slightly smugly satisfied ). He and I ended up becoming really close friends and through our friendship I realized that we would have made a terrible couple! These days he\u2019s married, I\u2019m wedded, and my friend is married, so all\u2019s well that aims well!"
