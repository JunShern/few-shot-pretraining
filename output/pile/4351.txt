    "text": "This invention pertains to a pedestal for supporting a top for a starting platform for one end of a swimming pool. Pedestals embodying this invention are adjustable so as not to require, in many instances, custom fitting, via custom cutting or welding operations, to accommodate pool dimensions, water level, and other factors from one swimming pool to another.\nIn a swimming meet, each swimmer starts at a starting platform, which may be also called a starting block, at one end of a swimming pool. Typically, a starting platform comprises a base, stand, or pedestal, to which a top is mounted so that its upper surface is horizontal or so that its upper surface is sloped slightly (e.g. not more than 10xc2x0 from horizontal) from the back edge of the top toward its front edge. Several models of such starting platforms are available commercially from Kiefer Pool Equipment Co. of Zion, Ill., as illustrated and described briefly on page 2 of its 2002 Product Guide, in which such starting platforms are called starting blocks.\nTypically, installation of a starting block must conform to governmental and non-governmental rules, standards, and regulations. As an example, a 1991 rule of the National Federation of State High School Associations provides that, if a swimming pool has less than four feet of water at its starting end, a starting platform may be no higher than eighteen inches from the water level at the starting end. Commonly, therefore, the base, stand, or pedestal of a starting platform, as known heretofore, must be custom fitted, via custom cutting and welding operations, so as to accommodate pool dimensions, water level, and other factors from one swimming pool to another.\nThis invention provides, for supporting a top for a starting platform for one end of a swimming pool, an adjustable pedestal, which has an upper member and a lower member. The upper and lower members are fastened releasably to each other, as by means comprising a bolt or bolts, so as to define a generally upright column having any of a plurality of adjusted lengths. The upper member is adapted to support a top for the starting platform. The lower member is adapted for anchoring to a base. Preferably, the upper and lower members are tubular and have a telescoping relationship when not fastened to each other, the upper member extending downwardly into the lower member.\nThe starting platform may have a step, which is fastened releasably to the generally upright column, via a bracket, to which the step is mounted, at any of a plurality of adjustable positions. Means comprising a bolt or bolts are used for fastening the bracket, to which the step is mounted, releasably to the generally upright column. The means used for fastening the upper and lower members releasably to each other may be also used for fastening the bracket, to which the step is mounted, releasably to the generally upright column.\nThe pedestal may have an upper step, an upper bracket, to which the upper step is mounted, a lower step, and a lower bracket, to which the lower step is mounted. Means comprising bolts are used for fastening the upper and lower members of the generally upright column releasably to each other, for fastening the upper bracket, to which the upper step is mounted, releasably to the generally upright column, and for fastening the lower bracket, to which the lower step is mounted, to the generally upright column. The means for fastening the upper and lower members of the generally upright column to each other may be also used for fastening the upper bracket, to which the upper step is mounted, releasably to the generally upright column.\nIn this document, all directional terms referring to a pedestal, particularly but not exclusively xe2x80x9cupperxe2x80x9d, xe2x80x9clowerxe2x80x9d, and xe2x80x9cgenerally uprightxe2x80x9d, are intended to refer to the pedestal, as installed in its usual orientation, not to limit the pedestal, as made and sold, to any particular orientation. Moreover, the term xe2x80x9cgenerally upright columnxe2x80x9d is intended to cover a sloping column, as well as a vertical column."
