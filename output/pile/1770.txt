    "text": "Q:\n\nConfused about finding non-brute force way to solve for matrix to the 2019th power\n\nI am attempting to solve this problem, it has four parts. I solved part a (a trivial matrix problem), but the next three parts appear to be a bit confusing to me. I just would like some help getting started so I can see and observe this matrix and come up with a solution. \nThe Questions Note:\nThe idea here is NOT to use brute force computation to get $A^{2019}$ matrix, instead use some observations which can significantly reduce computational work and will also give you an insight into such problems.\nObviously this is some huge numbered matrix, but I do not understand what observation will reduce this? My first thought was just to use a calculator and calculate $A^{2019}$ and then just multiply that by each vector. But that appears to be not the point of the question. \n$$\nLet A = \\left[\\begin{array}{rrr}\n  -4 & -6 & -12 \\\\\n   -2 & -1 & -4 \\\\\n  2 & 3 & 6 \n \\end{array}\\right]\n$$\nAnd Let $u$ = [6 5 -3], $v$ = [-2 0 1], and $w$ = [-2 -1 1].\nb). Compute $A^{2019}\\mathbb v$\n\nA:\n\nI assume that you're asking about $A^{2019}v$.\nTo that end, observe that $Av = 2v$ (I'll leave it to you to verify that this is true).  \nIt follows that \n$$\nA^2v = AAv = A(2v) = 2Av = 4v.\n$$\nSimilarly, $A^3 v = 8v$, and in general we have $A^k v = 2^k v$ for any positive integer $k$.\n\n"
