In a number of the pieces contained herein, wastage numbers are compared to enlistment numbers in a manner similar to a discussion of finances with reference to 'net gains.'\n\nOne of the arguments used in favour of conscription was that without it, the men currently at the front would be left with too great a burden. This gallery contains a mix of different material relating to the calls from the battlefield for more men. As well as materials relating to the actions of the government to increase the number of men Canada agreed to provide to the war effort.\n\nThis gallery contains coverage of the Quebec City Riots in a number of different papers from across the country--including the Quebec Chronicle, one of the \"pro\" conscription papers in Quebec City that was the target of rioters."
