    "text": "Hi guys, today I am showing a weight loss detox drink by which you will be able to lose\n5 Kgs In 3 Days (10 lbs in 3 Days). This is a very powerful drink\nand will help you get rid of excess water, bloating and toxins, prevent fat absorption\nand reduce weight by boosting your metabolism. It's a 3-day course,\nand you need to follow few guidelines to get desired results.\nSo let's get started- To make this weight loss drink, we would need castor oil.\nCastor oil is also known as Erandel or Arandi Oil.\nCastor oil is easily available at most of the pharmacies\nand retail stores. This oil is rich in nutrients like vitamin E,\nminerals, monounsaturated fatty acids and antioxidants.\nIt also has anti-fungal, anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial properties\nCastor oil is known as a powerful laxative but do you know that it also has ricinoleic acid\nwhich boosts your metabolism and works towards weight loss. Now, let's know how to make it.\nTo make the drink, take 1 cup of warm water.\nRemember, water can be hot or warm\nbut not cold. You can also make this drink with green tea or ginger tea\nI recently published a video on how to make ginger tea and its video link is in the description box.\nI also have a detailed video on green tea. So make sure to watch both the videos to make them right. Video links are in the description box.\nNow add 1 tbsp of castor oil and stir well. Drink it on an empty stomach\nfor 3 consecutive days.\nThe drink works like a cleaning detergent inside your stomach\nIt will clean your intestines, help get rid of toxins and detox your body completely.\nThis process also cures irregular periods, cholesterol problems, and hormonal issues.\nYou might have to visit washroom a few times as the body would be going through a cleaning process.\nFew guidelines to follow, to get the best results are -\nUse a good quality castor oil like cold-pressed castor oil.\nDo drink a lot of warm water, green or black tea or green or black coffee these 3 days\nas it will stimulate your body to burn more fat. Avoid eating out\nplus don\u2019t have refined sugar, meat, processed carbs, artificial sweeteners and full fat dairy including\nbutter, ghee (clarified butter), full-fat milk etc. \nRest of the day be on a healthy and clean diet\nand eat foods like fresh fruits, vegetable salad, oatmeal, soups or khichadi which is a salty porridge made with vegetables, lentils and rice all cooked together\nTry adding Himalayan Pink Salt instead of regular salt. Do not have chapatis, bread, etc.\nUse brown rice, oats, buckwheat or quinoa to make porridge. \nDon\u2019t use white rice.\nThis weight loss drink is not for pregnant and nursing mothers or someone\nallergic to castor oil. \nCastor oil has conjugated linoleic acid which causes breakdown\nand oxidation of fat especially stubborn belly fat. Following this process for 3 days,\nwill slim down your belly, detox your liver and eliminate extra water weight.\nDo not take this cleanse for more than 3 days. People have really benefitted from this cleanse.\nYou can learn the success comments from my English channel \"Versatile Vicky\" wherein I posted this video first.\nI\u2019ll also try coming up with a diet using this cleanse.\nFor now, do try this drink and share your comments. Hit like, subscribe to my channel if you still haven\u2019t and I will see you soon with a new video\ntill then, drink right to stay light. Bye Bye...\n"
