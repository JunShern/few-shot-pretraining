Now experts explain the science of profanity, revealing the evidence behind its positive and negative effects. Stock image\n\nIS SWEARING A SIGN OF A GOOD VOCABULARY? Research in 2014 revealed people who frequently swear are more likely to have a bigger vocabulary than their clean-tongued peers. A colourful tongue does not mean the talker is lazy or uneducated, the study published in the Language Sciences journal found. Instead, those who are more confident using taboo words are more articulate in other areas. Kristin and Timothy Jay, the US-based psychologists who co-wrote the study, said it proved swearing was positively correlated with verbal fluency. 'We cannot help but judge others on the basis of their speech,' they wrote. 'Unfortunately, when it comes to taboo language, it is a common assumption that people who swear frequently are lazy, do not have an adequate vocabulary, lack education, or simply cannot control themselves.'

They were then asked to do the same with animals.\n\nThose who knew the most swear words were more likely to name the most animals as well, the research found.\n\nKristin and Timothy Jay, the US-based psychologists who co-wrote the study, said it proved swearing was positively correlated with verbal fluency.\n\nThe average profile of a swearer is often sophisticated, like that of the swear-word loving spin doctor Malcolm Tucker (played by Peter Capaldi) in TV political satire The Thick of It\n\nTURNING THE NET BLUE: TOP 10 UK SWEAR WORDS ON FACEBOOK 1.

Instead, those who are more confident using taboo words are more articulate in other areas\n\nRather than just proving we swear more when we are angry, the psychologists insisted, the study showed profanity can be an emotional coping mechanism which makes us feel more resilient.\n\nThe group presented the findings of their study to the British Psychological Society's annual conference.\n\nIn the video game study, they said, participants were asked to recall as many profanities as they could before and after playing.\n\nSenior lecturer Dr Richard Stephens said: 'The video games made people feel more aggressive so their language became more emotional and they swore. This explains swearing and makes it more acceptable."
