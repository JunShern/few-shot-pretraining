No guitars, no bass, no keyboards but nevertheless an unbelievable melodic metal experience.\"That's how the official website of van Canto describes the band. Hailing from Germany, van Canto are what is called an a capellametal band, the pioneers of this new genre.The band released their debut, A Storm to Come, in December 2006. Exactly a year later, van Canto anounced a global signing to Gun Records/Sony BMG, and their debut was released worldwide on December 14.Van Canto are now experiencing considerable success. They recently provided support for Finnishsymphonic power metal band Nightwish, as well as receiving a slot at the internationally famous Wacken Open Air festival in Germany. The prestigious event sees them sharing the bill with acts such as Hatebreed, Sonata Arctica, As I Lay Dying, Soilwork, Children of Bodom, Nightwish, Lordi and headline act Iron Maiden.Van Canto's second album will be recorded accross this month and next, with famed producer Charlie Bauerfeind, although no release date has yet been confirmed.In light of recent events, van Canto member and founder Stefan Schmidt has given the band's first interview in English, all previous interviews being in German or Italian.\n\nSunday, February 24, 2008\n\nIn the year 2000, Dries Buytaert created Drupal, a freely licensed and open sourcetool to manage websites, as a bulletin board for his college dorm. Since Dries released the software and a community of thousands of volunteer developers have added and improved modules, Drupal has grown immensely popular. Drupal won the overall Open CMS Award in 2007, and some speakers in Drupal's spacious developer's room at FOSDEM 2008 were dreaming aloud of its world domination.\n\nBuytaert (now 29) just finished his doctoral thesis and has founded the start-up Acquia. The new company wants to become Drupal's best friend, with the help of an all-star team and US$7 million collected from venture capitalists. Wikinews reporter Micha\u00ebl Laurent sat down with Dries in Brussels to discuss these recent exciting developments.\n\nLisaMcPherson.org is a memorial site created in 1997 containing information on her death and the resulting legal case against the Church of Scientology.\n\nLisa McPherson died in 1995 while in the care of the Church of Scientology. After a car accident, she became mentally unstable. Scientologists removed her from the hospital and placed her in the Introspection Rundown, she died 17 days later while still in care of the Church. She was used as an icon during Project Chanology, the protest of the Church of Scientology by Anonymous. Protesters were pictured with signs that said \"Remember Lisa McPherson\" and \"Ask Scientology Why Lisa McPherson Died\", other protesters had posters with her picture on it.>>Read the interview here\n\nAt approximately 11:20 p.m. (eastern time) on Sunday night February 17, a call was placed into 911 stating that bricks from a wall, a nearly 40 foot section of the upper facade, were laying in the middle of Elmwood after falling off the building. The fire department had to shut down Elmwood from North Street to Allen at 11:30 p.m. until further notice due to the debris and risk to public safety.\n\nNo one was injured in the incident, but at least one parked car was damaged by falling bricks.\n\nAccording to police, this is not the first time bricks have fallen off the building. Several people over the past year were reported to have been nearly hit by single bricks that have fallen off the building. No one has yet been injured.\n\nThough no weather warnings have been issued for the City, winds with gusts up to 50 miles per hour have been reported through the night. It is not known if the wind played a factor in the damage to the building.\n\nCity engineers were on scene discussing how to handle the situation and clean up what has already fallen.\n\nThe museum is the world's largest collection of documents which are owned privately. The Buffalo building was original a Church of Christ built in 1911.\n\nSunday, February 17, 2008\n\nTelevision producer and owner of the anti-Scientology website XenuTV.com, Mark Bunker chatted online with Wikinews for nearly three hours. More than 120 people followed the interview live (many from Project Chanology), which makes this exclusive Wikinews interview is our most attended IRC interview to date.\n\nThursday, February 14, 2008\n\nIn her inaugural interview, Wikinews' Sandra Ordonez talks with America's Next Top Model's first Puerto Rican winner, Jaslene Gonzalez, about her childhood, what makes her a strong individual, and what television show her abuela would want her to go on. This is also the first time one of our interviews can also be read in Spanish at Wikinoticias.\u00bb Full story\n\nWhat is the fulcrum in Mr. West's life that led him to realize a talent to shape personalities with his voice, and how did the discovery of that gift shape him? David Shankbone found that like many great comedians, West faced more sour early in life than he did sweet. The sour came from a physically and emotionally abusive alcoholic father (\"I could tell you the kind of night I was going to have from the sound of the key in the door or the way the car pulled up.\"), to his own problems with drug and alcohol use (\"There is a point that you can reach in your life where you don\u2019t want to live, but you haven\u2019t made the decision to die.\").\n\n...\n\nI\u2019m telling you stuff that I never said to anybody...\n\n...\n\nIf sin, suffering and redemption feel like the stages of an endless cycle of American existence, West's own redemption from his brutalized childhood is what helped shape his gift. He performed little bits to cheer up his cowed mother, ravaged by the fact she could not stop her husband's abuse of young West. \"I was the whipping boy and she would just be reduced to tears a lot of times, and I would come in and say stuff, and I would put out little bits just to pull her out of it.\"\n\nThe deadline to ask questions is Friday February 15, 2008. The plan will be to conduct the interview on IRC in the channel #wikinews-interviews, on the freenode network (irc.freenode.net) with prepared questions. If there are not a lot of questions prepared, then the floor will be open to questioning by anyone attending the interview.\n\nPlease read the questions to make sure you don't ask the same one as someone else.\n\nThe date of the interview is scheduled to take place on Saturday February 16, 2008 at 4:00 p.m. (eastern time) or 1:00 p.m. (pacific time), or 21:00 UTC on the irc.freenode.net server in the channel #wikinews-interviews.\n\nDirections on how to enter IRC channel:Click here.

Wikinews was in nearly 15 different countries and over 50 cities throughout the globe to bring you the most extensive, in-depth and opinion free reporting anywhere on the net. We hope you enjoy this article, the reports, video and photos, as much as we enjoyed bringing them to you. Thanks everyone for your hard work and contributions. They are greatly appreciated.\n\nThe Internet group Anonymous today held protests critical of the Church of Scientology. The protests marked what would have been the 49th birthday of Lisa McPherson, who is claimed to be a victim of the Church of Scientology's practices. Lisa died in 1995 during a running of what Scientologists refer to as an Introspection Rundown, a procedure intended to help Church members deal with a psychotic or deeply traumatic event.\n\nProtests were planned throughout the day in 14 countries and over 50 different cities. The estimation of total protesters world wide for Feb. 10, 2008 is 9,250 people.\n\nWikinews had correspondents at a number of protest locations to report on the events. This article was updated throughout the day with reports from around the globe.\n\nThe deadline to ask questions is Friday February 15, 2008. The plan will be to conduct the interview on IRC in the channel #wikinews-interviews, on the freenode network (irc.freenode.net) with prepared questions.

CariDee has even lobbied in Congress for the passage of a bill which would ask the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Institute of Medicine to increase spending on finding a cure for psoriasis. You can read more about her role with the National Psoriasis Foundation here.\n\nWikinews reporter Mike Halterman sat down and talked with CariDee earlier in the week to discuss her own issues with psoriasis, how she has helped other sufferers in her role as spokeswoman for the Foundation, as well as what it's like to be a new model in New York City and her thoughts on how the fashion industry runs today.\n\nWednesday, February 6, 2008\n\nIn an interview with Wikinews reporter Nicholas Turnbull, prominent free speech activist and critic of Scientology David S. Touretzky gave his opinion on the recent backlash against the Church of Scientology that has erupted on the Internet, recently spurred on in declarations by a nebulous Internet entity using the name Anonymous that the organization will be destroyed. Anonymous has directed recent protests at Scientology centres across the world, which have attracted significant numbers of individuals supporting the cause.\n\nTouretzky, a research professor in artificial intelligence and computational neuroscience at Carnegie Mellon University, has been a prominent critic of the Church of Scientology since mid-1995, and has been protesting against Scientology vociferously since then; he has also run websites that publish material that Scientology wishes to keep suppressed from the public eye, such as extracts from Scientology's formerly-confidential Operating Thetan (OT) materials. Touretzky views the actions of the Church of Scientology as being \"a threat to free speech\", and has endured harassment by the Church of Scientology for his activities.\n\nAt the moment there is no deadline to ask questions. The hopeful plan is to conduct the interview on IRC. Hopefully this can be Wikinews' first Interview Of The Month, in well a very long time. More details on how and when the interview will take place will be released as details are known.\n\nSunday, February 3, 2008\n\nClaiming that \"actions are being taken\", a Church of Scientology representative has responded exclusively to Wikinews regarding the recent attacks on their web sites from the nebulous \"Anonymous\" group. In an effort to get the Church's side of the story, Wikinews freelance journalist Brian McNeil located a contact address, knowledge@lrh.org. A \"Laetitia\" responded, ignoring a detailed list of questions that would have given information on the damage inflicted on the Church and action taken. Instead non-specific comments about how the Church is handling the issue were given. She first started by asking if Wikinews was \"part of Anonymous or are you pro-Scientology?\"\n\n\"Activities of Anonymous have been reported to the Authorities and actions are being taken. Their activities are illegal and we do not approve of them. At the same time, our main work is to improve the environment, make people more able and spiritually aware. ... yes, we are taking action,\" said Laetitia.\n\nWikinews sent the e-mails from the Church to several experts on Scientology for an expert opinion on what they might have been trying to say. Although there was minimal response, Wikinews heard from the creator of Operation Clambake, which is a project formed in 1996 as a direct result of seeing the Church succeeding in removing criticism from the Internet. Wikinews also heard from another expert on Scientology and former Church member, who wishes to remain anonymous.>>Click here for the full EXCLUSIVE story.\n\nGot a scoop for us?
