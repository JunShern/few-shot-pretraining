Until a couple of days ago, I was the\n  commanding officer of the Olympia. \nSISKO: The Olympia. \nLISA [OC]: We left the Federation over eight years ago for a long\n  range exploration of the Beta Quadrant. \nSISKO: What happened to your ship, Captain? \nLISA [OC]: We were finally heading home, if you can believe that,\n  then we picked up some strange energy readings in a nearby star\n  system, and I decided to stop and investigate. We found an energy\n  barrier around the fourth planet that was unlike anything we'd ever\n  seen, and when we probed it with our scanners it triggered a quantum\n  reaction. There was an enormous surge of metrion radiation that\n  disabled our engines. The next thing I knew, we were spiraling in\n  toward the surface. I gave the order to abandon ship and the last\n  thing I remember is a console exploding in my face. I woke up in an\n  escape pod on the surface and I've spent the last day and a half\n  sitting in this cave trying to raise someone on subspace. \nBASHIR: Captain, Doctor Bashir, Chief Medical Officer. Your message\n  said that you were on a L class planet. Are you sure? \nLISA [OC]: Positive. And to answer your next question, yes, I've been\n  giving myself fifteen cc's of triox every four hours to compensate for\n  the excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Just like it says in my\n  medical tricorder. \nBASHIR: How much triox do you have left? \nLISA [OC]: One hundred and fifty millilitres. \nBASHIR: Will you to decrease the dosage, Captain, to eight cc's every\n  six hours. We need to stretch your supply as long as possible. \nKASIDY: What happens when she runs out of the drug? \nLISA [OC]: That's a good question, Doctor. What happens then? \nBASHIR: You will begin to experience the effects of hypoxia. But\n  before that happens, the triox compound will have strengthened your\n  cardiopulmonary system, allowing you to better withstand the effects. \nLISA [OC]: Better withstand the effects. In other words, I'm going to\n  be gasping for air and turning different shades of blue by the time\n  you get here.  \nBASHIR: Yes, I'm afraid so. \nLISA [OC]: Thanks for brightening my day. \nKASIDY: Is there anything we can do? \nLISA [OC]: There is, actually. I can't sleep. I think the injections\n  are keeping me awake and I haven't had anyone to talk to for two\n  days.\nSISKO: We'll be able to help you with that, Captain. I'll have one of\n  my officers stay on the comm. line with you at all times.\n\nSo the ship left eight years ago, they were doing long range exploration, Lisa doesn't know anything about the Dominion war, and she's only been on the planet for two days. \nWe learn later that the crew are communicating with her in the past, which is an entirely different issue.\nDid the ship go forward in time when it hit the metreon radiation in the atmosphere? Is that the explanation that Lisa was giving? I'm confused about the time frame of how this all happened.\n\nA:\n\nThe Metreon radiation caused a temporal lensing effect, sending her communications into her future (the Defiant's present), and their replies back in time (from their perspective) to Captain Cusak's present. There\u2019s no indication that Cusak\u2019s ship travelled in time; just the communications to and from it.\nDr. Bashir confirmed she had died 3 years and two months prior to them arriving at the planet in the Rutharian sector. So she would have left on her mission 8 years plus 3 years ago, making that 2363 (the episode takes place in 2374).\nTo put that into perspective, 2363 is one year prior to the first season of Star Trek: The Next Generation\n\n"
