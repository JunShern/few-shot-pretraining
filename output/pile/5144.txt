    "text": "February 27, 2006\n\nOne Is Black, And One Is White. Life's An Eskimo Pie, Let's Take A Bite!\n\nIn a story that has rocked the British tabloidscape, a teen dad has named one of his twin daughters after himself. Oh, and in other news, the kid's white.\n\nThe two bi-racial parents had fraternal twin girls; one is blonde-blue-eyed, and 'white', and the other is, well, I was just about to type 'black,' but that feels like missing the whole point. I mean, is the definition of 'black' 'not white'? I don't think so. I went back and put quotes around 'white'.\n\nI was about to rag on the headline-grabbing statistic of \"a million to one\" odds, but as the article goes on to explain, that's for a bi-racial couple. to have fraternal twins. with significantly disparate skin tones. including one who's white. Break it down, and there's a 1-in-100 probability that biracial parents will have a whitey white baby. So what's the big deal?\n\nIn a moment like this, the immortal words of Frank Sinatra* come to mind: \"Side by side, you are my amigo, Negro, let's not fiiiiiiiight!\"\n\n3 Comments\n\nWhat I was really looking for, but didn't find because my daughter is tugging on my arm asking to be read a book, is a good link about chimera babies. It's a condition in which the child's DNA doesn't necessarily match the parents', and different body parts of the same child can have different DNA. This can lead to a white child from black parents, though most chimeras look \"normal\" and never learn of their condition unless they have odd circumstances leading to multiple DNA tests using samples from differing parts of their body."
