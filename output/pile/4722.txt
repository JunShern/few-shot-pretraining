    "text": "In Paris, the suit is back. Or is at least attempting a comeback.\n\nIt was always going to be high on the agenda at Dior, which showed its autumn/winter show on Friday night. Artistic director Kim Jones might be the man who spliced tailoring with streetwear at Louis Vuitton, most notably in his 2017 collaboration with Supreme, but for his second collection at the fashion house he focused on \u201carchitectural tailoring\u201d, drawing heavily on the label\u2019s couture heritage \u2013 despite this being a ready-to-wear show.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about reaffirming Dior with lots of tailoring \u2026 except with this spirit of now,\u201d he said the evening before the show.\n\nYet elsewhere on the Paris catwalks this week, tailoring has outweighed sportswear for the first time in several seasons. Both Dries Van Noten and Berluti closed their shows with civilised black suits, but even Vetements, king of subversive anti-fashion, and Louis Vuitton\u2019s Virgil Abloh, king of streetwear, opened theirs with princely versions of their own.\n\nThe Dior show took place in a giant black box within the Champ de Mars park, behind the Eiffel Tower. Inside, the models were static, carried along a 76 metre conveyor belt designed to look like a salon show on a giant scale.\n\nThis tableaux vivant replicated the statues outside, but was chosen because Jones thinks it is the \u201cnicest way\u201d to display a suit. It also photographs well, proving that even in an industry which sets its clock by social media Jones knows what he is doing. That some wore tabards and vests gave it an Action Man feel, although this was accidental.\n\n\u201cThe armour is not a reference to what\u2019s going on at the moment in politics here,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were looking at that reference six months ago. It\u2019s my third collection, and you get a bit insular.\u201d\n\nThe front row at Dior Homme. From left: Kate Moss, Dior CEO Pietro Beccari, his wife Elisabetta Beccari; actor Robert Pattinson. Photograph: Bertrand Rindoff Petroff/Getty Images\n\nThe six-day Paris event might be menswear\u2019s largest, and busiest \u2013 only here is the schedule expanding not contracting \u2013 but that does not mean it\u2019s free from drama. With gilets jaunes anti-government protests predicted to take place on Saturday 19 January, Dior was one of the shows to change times, moving its show back one night.\n\nJones seemed nonplussed \u2013 \u201cwe\u2019re quite organised, so it\u2019s not been too bad to change \u2013 a few guests missing perhaps\u201d \u2013 but the reality was, one imagines, slightly more fraught.\n\nThe collection showed 39-year-old Jones\u2019s ability to rework couture for a modern crowd. The suits came inlaid with satin, creating a sort of inside out effect, in colours of mink, light blue and black.\n\nThere was season-appropriate cashmere, and some hip oversized knitwear designed in collaboration with punk artist Raymond Pettibon, made \u201cusing a technique which resembles Moire\u201d which everyone had to Google.\n\nUnlike many of the shows this week, there are no women on this catwalk. \u201cWe don\u2019t need women here, this is men\u2019s. I\u2019ve got to respect Maria Grazia [Chiuri, creative director of womenswear at Dior].\u201d\n\nStill, the saddle bags were reworked from women\u2019s, while the \u201chardcore leather opera gloves\u201d had a certain gender fluidity.\n\nMore looks on the conveyor belt catwalk during the Dior show in Paris.

He enjoys these flourishes, of \u201ccarrying the concept of Dior as a gallerist as well as a couturier\u201d, although one hand-beaded shirt which required 16 people working for 1,600 hours, was as much work as art.\n\nDespite being \u201cpretty tired\u201d the day before, he still had one eye on friend David Beckham, who popped in the day before to say hello, and the other on the commercial.\n\n\u201cThe red carpet is not usually something I think of a lot but we are dressing a lot of people,\u201d he said. At the Golden Globes, Dior was worn by nominees Viggo Mortensen and Darren Criss. No surprise that Dior is still the world\u2019s biggest luxury brand. The suit expected to appear on the next round of red carpets is a classic shape with a long satin wrap. \u201cBlack tie can be a limited thing, but you don\u2019t want it too peacocky.\u201d\n\nPlus the stars love him. Just before Beckham turned up, Christina Ricci entered holding a tiny dog, and proceeded to take photos in the mirror. Behind her, Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell exited minutes apart. All sat front row."
