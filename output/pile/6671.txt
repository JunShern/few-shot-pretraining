See here.\nSometimes, when introducing students to R, I've recommended it to help them remember what they did and what the results were, a situation somewhat like you describe.\nIn my experience on a Linux machine, even if you close R without calling txtStop, the output is saved to whatever text file you had specified at the start of your session. \n\n"
