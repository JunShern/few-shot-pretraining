INTRODUCTION {#fsn31012-sec-0001}\n===============\n\nIt is a fact that human exposure to vast chronic ailments has never been higher than this present age. Free radicals are being generated at high quantities, particularly at metabolic and contact processes. Tissues and cells are damaged by oxidation as macromolecules (fatty acids, nucleic acids, and proteins) deteriorate (Gupta et al., [2014](#fsn31012-bib-0019){ref-type=\"ref\"}). Basically, the reaction that takes place between free radicals and electrons derived from other molecules harms the human body due to its negative effect on the enzyme system (Bjelakovic, Nikolova, Gluud, Simonetti, & Gluud, [2007](#fsn31012-bib-0009){ref-type=\"ref\"}). Hence, the complex systems of enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants have the capability to address the deteriorating impacts of oxidants and free radicals that may lead to infirmity. An antioxidant is a type of compound that stabilizes, scavenges, and suppresses the generation of oxidants and free radicals. Therefore, consumption of antioxidants based on natural resources (greens, fruits, and herbs) may help to shield one from oxidants and free radicals without side effects.\n\nAll enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant assays described in the review are based on UV--vis spectrophotometry method. Apart from spectrophotometry method for analysis of antioxidants, other methods such as electrochemical and chromatography methods have also been used. The electrochemical methods include cyclic voltammetry, superwave voltammetry, differential pulse voltammetry, coulometry, potentiometry, amperometry, and biamperometry. The chromatography methods include thin layer chromatography (TLC), liquid chromatography--mass spectrophotometry (LC\u2010MS), high\u2010performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and gas chromatography. However, among all the methods mentioned above, the spectrophotometry method has been the most commonly used method because it is the easiest to handle and inexpensive to run when compared to the electrochemical and chromatography methods.\n\nSpectrophotometry method can be performed by using a cuvette or a microplate reader. Analysis of antioxidant by using cuvette is usually conducted for small number of samples. The method is time consuming as only one sample is allowed to be read at one time which takes about 1--2\u00a0min. This method also requires high amount of reaction mixture due to large volume of cuvette (approximately 1.5--2\u00a0ml). In contrast, the use of a microplate is more convenient and time saving. It allows reading of 96 samples at one time. Presently, a microplate reader of spectrophotometer has been upgraded to allow reading of 384 samples at one time. By using a microplate reader, the volume of samples needed is significantly low (approximately 100--200\u00a0\u00b5l). Hence, the amount of reaction mixture needed to prepare is low, thus saving the use of chemicals.\n\nAs such, a number of methods have been proposed to quantify antioxidant content in many samples. With that, this paper presents a review pertaining to the common techniques employed to analyze both enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants.\n\n2. FREE RADICALS, REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES (ROS), AND REACTIVE NITROGEN SPECIES (RNS) {#fsn31012-sec-0002}\n====================================================================================\n\nFree radicals are claimed to be harmful to humans because its unpaired electron(s) extracts electron(s) from other molecules in the body to gain stability, hence damaging DNA, proteins, and lipids. These free radicals, which can be found as nitrogen derived (RNS) or oxygen derived (ROS), have rather high reactivity and short life. Components that are present as free radicals in ROS are O~2~ (superoxide), HO^\u2022^ (hydroxyl), HO~2~ (hydroperoxyl), ROO^\u2022^ (peroxyl), and RO^\u2022^ (alkoxyl), while those nonradicals refer to H~2~O~2~(hydrogen peroxide), HClO (hypochlorous acid), O~3~ (ozone), and ^1^O~2~ (singlet oxygen). Meanwhile, NO^\u2022^ (nitric oxide), NO~2~ (nitrogen dioxide), N~2~O~3~ (dinitrogen trioxide), and ONOO^\u2212^ (peroxynitrite) are the free radicals derived from RNS (Ali et al., [2008](#fsn31012-bib-0004){ref-type=\"ref\"}; Evans & Halliwell, [1999](#fsn31012-bib-0016){ref-type=\"ref\"}).\n\nThe major source of ROS is the environment that is filled with car exhaust fume, cigarette smoke, ozone, and low\u2010wave electromagnetic and ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Meanwhile, some sources of the endogenous ROS are amino acids auto\u2010oxidation, respiratory burst by phagocytes, ischemia reperfusion injury, and mitochondrial electron transport chain. Hydroxyl radical (HO^\u2022^), which is generated from H~2~O~2~ and O~2~ via Harber--Weiss reaction, refers to a damaging ROS with 10^\u22125^\u00a0s half\u2010life (Beauchamp & Fridovich, [1970](#fsn31012-bib-0007){ref-type=\"ref\"}). The H~2~O~2~ component, although with poor reactivity and relatively stable properties, can cross cell membranes easily and arrack various sites after conversion to HO. Besides, H~2~O~2~ produces free radicals with the existence of transition metal ions.\n\nOne essential RNS\u2010based free radical refers to nitric oxide (NO) as this component is one of the 10 smallest molecules that are naturally found in 30\u2010Da molecular weight. The processes of redox, substitution, addition, and chain termination reaction are closely associated to NO. According to Stamler ([1994](#fsn31012-bib-0036){ref-type=\"ref\"}), the primary targets of NO are proteins that contain metals, intracellular thiol, and low molecular weight thiols (glutathione). The peroxynitrite (ONOO^\u2212^) is also an essential antioxidant with a range of targets. The mechanism of ONOO^\u2212^ is as follows: peroxidation of lipid, break of DNA strand, nitration of tyrosine, and, lastly, death of cell. Upon reaction with NO, ONOO^\u2212^ produces NO~2~ and causes nitrosative stress, while generating N~2~O~2~ with more NO (Koppenol, Moreno, Pryor, Ischiropoulos, & Beckman, [1992](#fsn31012-bib-0022){ref-type=\"ref\"}).\n\nHarmful oxidative stress, which can lead to chronic disease, is produced when RNS and ROS concentrations exceed the amount of antioxidants in the human body.\n\n3. ANTIOXIDANTS {#fsn31012-sec-0003}\n===============\n\nOxidative stress can be addressed by antioxidants by delaying or preventing the oxidative chain reaction promulgation. Plant\u2010based antioxidants scavenge free radicals to inhibit tissue/cell damages, hence minimizing risk of chronic diseases (Soobrattee, Bahorun, Neergheen, Googoolye, & Aruoma, [2008](#fsn31012-bib-0035){ref-type=\"ref\"}). Besides, antioxidants donate their electrons in order to neutralize both exogenous and endogenous free radicals (Jacob, [1995](#fsn31012-bib-0021){ref-type=\"ref\"}).\n\nAntioxidant components are composed of lipid\u2010soluble (hydrophobic) and water\u2010soluble (hydrophilic) substances. Plant\u2010based antioxidants are mostly hydrophilic, in which some instances are phenolics, flavonoids, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), as well as uric, lipoic, benzoic, and ascorbic acids. On the other hand, hydrophobic antioxidants are linked to biological membrane functional, which are found in carotenoids, tocopherols, vitamin K, ubiquinone, and phospholipids.\n\nAdditionally, antioxidants are categorized depending on defense lines: preventive antioxidant as the initial line of defense, radical scavenging antioxidant in the second line of defense, and, lastly, repair and de\u2010novo enzymes as the third line of defense, as further elaborated: The first line of defense hinders the production of free radicals that leads to oxidative stress via enzymes, such as SOD, CAT, GPx, glutathione reductase, and several types of minerals, for example, selenium (Se), manganese (Mn), copper (Cu), and iron (Fe).The second line of defense inhibits the production of damaged species, apart from making the free radicals less harmful that further reduces damages caused by oxidative reaction. Some excellent scavengers of free radicals are vitamins E and C, flavonoids, and uric acid.The third line of defense serves to repair damaged DNAs, proteins, peroxides, and oxidized lipids, besides inhibiting the propagation of chain reaction in peroxyl lipid radical.\n\nThe classification of antioxidants depends on their catalytic action type, either enzymatic or nonenzymatic antioxidants. The enzymatic antioxidants possess certain cofactors and tend to be highly specific for substrate reactive species. Some instances of enzymatic antioxidants refer to SOD, CAT, and GPx. Meanwhile, those nonenzymatic antioxidants differ from the former as they do not possess any specific substrate and, hence, could nullify the negative effects of both RNS and ROS.\n\n4. ENZYMATIC ANTIOXIDANT ASSAY {#fsn31012-sec-0004}\n==============================\n\n4.1. Superoxide dismutase assay {#fsn31012-sec-0005}\n-------------------------------\n\nThe enzyme extract was prepared by homogenizing fresh samples (200\u00a0mg) in 5\u00a0ml of 100\u00a0mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) that contained 0.1% (v/v) Triton X\u2010100, 2% (w/v) polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), and 0.1\u00a0mM EDTA. Next, the extract was filtered and centrifuged at 22,000\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0*g* for 10\u00a0min at temperature 4\u00b0C. The resultant supernatant was collected and dialyzed by using cellophane membrane tubing for 240\u00a0min against cold extraction buffer. The remaining extract was used for enzyme assay.\n\nThe final volume of incubation mixture is 3\u00a0ml that contains 50\u00a0mM of potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8), 45\u00a0\u00b5M of methionine, 20\u00a0\u00b5M of potassium cyanide, 84\u00a0\u00b5M of nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT), and 5.3\u00a0mM of riboflavin. The amount of homogenate added to the mixture is kept under one unit of enzyme so as to ensure high accuracy. The mixture is incubated at 25\u00b0C with the presence of 15\u00a0W fluorescent lamps in an aluminum foil\u2010lined box. After 10\u00a0min of exposure to light, the reduction in NBT is measured at absorbance of 600\u00a0nm. Absence of enzyme is indicated by the highest reduction. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that leads to 50% inhibition of NBT reduction (Misra & Fridovich, [1972](#fsn31012-bib-0027){ref-type=\"ref\"}).\n\n4.2. Catalase assay {#fsn31012-sec-0006}\n-------------------\n\nExtraction of catalase assay was prepared by homogenizing fresh samples (200\u00a0mg) in 5\u00a0ml of 50\u00a0mM Tris\u2010NaOH at pH 8.0 that contained 0.5% (v/v) Triton X\u2010100, 2% (w/v) PVP, and 0.5\u00a0mM EDTA. The homogenate was centrifuged for 10\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C at 22,000\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0*g*, and the resultant supernatant was dialyzed prior to enzyme assay.\n\nCatalase assay can be conducted by adhering to the method suggested by Aebi ([1984](#fsn31012-bib-0001){ref-type=\"ref\"}). One milliliter of reaction mixture containing 50\u00a0mM of potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and 250\u00a0\u00b5l of enzyme extract is initiated by adding 60\u00a0mM of hydrogen peroxide. The absorbance is measured by using a spectrophotometer at an absorbance rate of 240\u00a0nm for 3\u00a0min. The H~2~O~2~ decomposition is calculated by using extinction coefficient of 39.4\u00a0mM^\u22121^\u00a0cm^\u22121^. One unit of activity is equivalent to 1\u00a0mM of H~2~O~2~ degraded per minute and is expressed as unit per milligram of protein.\n\n4.3. Peroxidase assay {#fsn31012-sec-0007}\n---------------------\n\nTwo grams of samples had been homogenized with 10\u00a0ml of 0.1\u00a0M phosphate buffer (pH 6.0). The extract was filtered through cheesecloth and centrifuged for 30\u00a0min at 12,000\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0*g*. The resultant supernatant was collected and heated at 65\u00b0C for 3\u00a0min to inactivate any catalase present in the extract.\n\nPeroxidase assay is prepared by performing the guaiacol oxidation method as depicted by Britton and Mehley ([1955](#fsn31012-bib-0011){ref-type=\"ref\"}). The final reaction mixture (3\u00a0ml) in the test tube consists of 10\u00a0mM of potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 8\u00a0mM of guaiacol, and 100\u00a0\u00b5l of enzyme extract, in which 2.75\u00a0mM of hydrogen peroxide is added to initiate the reaction. Increment in absorbance measured at 470\u00a0nm within 30\u00a0min indicates the formation of tetraguaiacol. The change in absorbance per min and specific activity as enzyme units per mg soluble protein with extinction coefficient 6.39\u00a0mM^\u22121^\u00a0cm^\u22121^ refers to a unit of peroxidase activity. The enzyme activity is expressed as unit per milligram of protein.\n\n4.4. Ascorbate peroxidase assay {#fsn31012-sec-0008}\n-------------------------------\n\nThe enzyme assay was extracted from 200\u00a0mg of samples. Next, the samples were homogenized in 50\u00a0mM potassium phosphate buffer (5\u00a0ml, pH 7.8) that contained 1\u00a0mM ascorbic acid, 1\u00a0mM phenylmethane sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 1% PVP. The reaction mixture was centrifuged at 22,000\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0*g* at 4\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min. The resultant supernatant was collected and dialyzed prior to enzyme assay.\n\nThe reaction mixture that contains 100\u00a0mM of Tris\u2010acetate buffer (pH 7.0), 2\u00a0mM of ascorbic acid, and enzyme extract is added with 2\u00a0mM of hydrogen peroxide to initiate the reaction. The decrease in absorbance rate is measured by using a spectrophotometer at 290\u00a0nm for 100\u00a0s. The extinction coefficient 2.8\u00a0mM^\u22121^\u00a0cm^\u22121^ is used to calculate the reaction. The specific enzyme activity is expressed as unit per milligram of protein (Ali, Hahn, & Paek, [2005](#fsn31012-bib-0003){ref-type=\"ref\"}).\n\n4.5. Ascorbate oxidase assay {#fsn31012-sec-0009}\n----------------------------\n\nThe plant sample tissue was extracted in 20\u00a0mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.4), 1.5% PVPP, and 0.5\u00a0mM PMSF. After that, the mixture was homogenized with Polytron, incubated on ice for 20\u00a0min, and vortexed for every 2\u2010min interval. Next, the mixture was centrifuged at 15,000\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0*g* at 4\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min. The resultant supernatant was collected and dialyzed prior to enzyme assay.\n\nThe final reaction mixture consists of 1.0\u00a0ml that is comprised of 20\u00a0mM of potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and 2.5 of mM ascorbic acid. The 10\u00a0\u00b5l of enzyme extract is added to initiate the reaction. Due to ascorbate oxidation, the decrease in absorbance is monitored for 3\u00a0min at an absorbance rate of 265\u00a0nm and calculated by using extinction coefficient, 14\u00a0mM^\u22121^\u00a0cm^\u22121^ (Diallinas et al., [1997](#fsn31012-bib-0014){ref-type=\"ref\"}).\n\n4.6. Guaiacol peroxidase assay {#fsn31012-sec-0010}\n------------------------------\n\nThe enzyme extract for determination of guaiacol peroxidase assay was performed by homogenizing 200\u00a0mg of fresh samples in 5\u00a0ml of cold 50\u00a0mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.0. Next, the dialyzed enzyme extract was used for assay after being centrifuged at 22,000\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0*g* for 10\u00a0min.\n\nThe assay mixture (5\u00a0ml) contained 2\u00a0mM H~2~O~2~, 9\u00a0mM guaiacol, 40\u00a0mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.1), and 50\u00a0\u00b5l enzyme. The increment in absorbance was measured at 420\u00a0nm and calculated by using extinction coefficient of 26.6\u00a0mM^\u22121^\u00a0cm^\u22121^ for 2\u00a0min with 30\u2010s interval. The outcomes are expressed as unit per milligram of protein (Egley, Paul, Vaughn, & Duke, [1983](#fsn31012-bib-0015){ref-type=\"ref\"}).\n\n4.7. Glutathione reductase assay {#fsn31012-sec-0011}\n--------------------------------\n\nGlutathione reductase assay was carried out by adhering to the method depicted by Schaedle and Bassham ([1977](#fsn31012-bib-0033){ref-type=\"ref\"}). The enzyme extract was prepared prior to enzyme assay. Briefly, 200\u00a0mg of fresh samples was homogenized by using chilled mortar and pestle in 5\u00a0ml of 50\u00a0mM Tris\u2010HCl buffer at pH 7.6. The resultant supernatant was collected after being centrifuged at 22,000\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0*g* for 4\u00a0min and dialyzed prior to enzyme assay.\n\nThe final reaction mixture (1\u00a0ml) was composed of 200\u00a0\u00b5l enzyme extract, 50\u00a0mM Tris\u2010HCl buffer (pH 7.6), 1\u00a0mM glutathione disulfide (GSSG), 0.15\u00a0mM NADPH, and 3\u00a0mM MgCl~2~. A decrease in NADPH absorbance was observed at 340\u00a0nm. The specific activity of enzyme is expressed as unit per milligram of protein.\n\n5. NONENZYMATIC ANTIOXIDANTS ASSAY {#fsn31012-sec-0012}\n==================================\n\n5.1. Total polyphenol content {#fsn31012-sec-0013}\n-----------------------------\n\nPolyphenols are polyhydroxylated phytochemical that are synthesized by plants and have many benefits to the human health. Polyphenols have abilities to trap and to scavenge free radicals by donating hydrogen ion to stabilize the free radicals. In addition, polyphenols can regulate nitric oxide, induce apoptosis, inhibit cell proliferation and angiogenesis, and prevent high blood pressure, apart from possessing anti\u2010aging, anti\u2010bacterial, and anti\u2010tumor properties. The two major subclasses of polyphenols are phenolic acids and flavonoids (Arts & Hollman, [2005](#fsn31012-bib-0006){ref-type=\"ref\"}; Yazaki, Sasaki, & Tsurumaru, [2009](#fsn31012-bib-0039){ref-type=\"ref\"}).\n\nThe total polyphenols content in the plant can be determined by employing the method suggested by Marinova, Ribarova, and Atanassova ([2005](#fsn31012-bib-0025){ref-type=\"ref\"}). A total of 10\u00a0\u00b5l of sample extract are mixed with 2.5\u00a0ml of 10\u2010fold of diluted Folin--Ciocalteu reagent. After 5\u00a0min, 2.5\u00a0ml of 7% sodium carbonate is added and the mixture is incubated at room temperature. After an hour of incubation, the absorbance of reaction mixture is measured at 725\u00a0nm. The total polyphenol content is expressed as milligram gallic acid equivalents per gram of samples.\n\n5.2. Total phenolic acids {#fsn31012-sec-0014}\n-------------------------\n\nPhenolic acids are hydroxylated that derive from benzoic and cinnamic acids. Hydrobenzoic acid is mainly present in the form of glucosides in foods, while hydrocinnamic acid, such as *p*\u2010coumaric, caffeic acid, and ferrulic acid, is mostly found in food as simple esters (Mattila & Kumpulainen, [2002](#fsn31012-bib-0026){ref-type=\"ref\"}).\n\nTotal phenolic acids can be determined by adhering to the method proposed by Singleton and Rossi ([1965](#fsn31012-bib-0034){ref-type=\"ref\"}), which is known as the Folin--Ciocalteu phenol reagent technique. Briefly, 1\u00a0ml of sample extract is added into a test tube that contains 9\u00a0ml of distilled water. Then, 1\u00a0ml of Folin--Ciocalteu phenol reagent is added to it and the mixture is mixed thoroughly via vortex. After 5\u00a0min, 10\u00a0ml of 7% sodium carbonate is added. Next, 4\u00a0ml of distilled water is added and the mixture is adjusted to 25\u00a0ml of final volume. The reaction mixture is incubated for 90\u00a0min at room temperature, and the absorbance is measured at 750\u00a0nm. The total phenolic acids are expressed as milligram of gallic acid equivalents per gram of samples.\n\n5.3. Total flavonoids {#fsn31012-sec-0015}\n---------------------\n\nFlavonoids are widely found in plants, and they consist of a large group of polyphenolic compounds that can be characterized by benzo\u2010y\u2010pyrone structure. Flavonoids are low molecular phenolics, and they can be divided into several subclasses, such as flavones, flavanones, isoflavones, anthocyanins, flavanols, and flavonols. The most crucial function of flavonoids is their antioxidant activity. Flavonoids can scavenge various oxidizing species, including superoxide anion, hydroxyl or peroxyl radicals by quenching the singlet oxygen. Flavonoids can also act as an inhibitor in oxidation of low density lipoprotein (LDL), anti\u2010bacterial, and anti\u2010fungal, besides preventing malaria (Harborne & Williams, [2000](#fsn31012-bib-0020){ref-type=\"ref\"}; Subramanian, Stacey, & Yu, [2007](#fsn31012-bib-0037){ref-type=\"ref\"}).\n\nThe content of total flavonoids can be determined based on the method depicted by Marinova et al. ([2005](#fsn31012-bib-0025){ref-type=\"ref\"}) by employing the aluminum chloride colorimetric technique. Briefly, 1\u00a0ml of sample extract is added into a test tube containing 4\u00a0ml of distilled water. After that, 0.3\u00a0ml of 5% sodium nitrite is added. After 5\u00a0min, 0.3\u00a0ml of 10% aluminum chloride is added into the mixture. At the sixth min, 2\u00a0ml of 1\u00a0M sodium hydroxide is added. Next, the mixture is adjusted to 10\u00a0ml by adding 2.4\u00a0ml of distilled water and mixed thoroughly with a vortex machine. The absorbance of the reaction mixture is measured at 510\u00a0nm. The total flavonoid content of the extract is expressed as milligram rutin equivalents per gram of samples.\n\n5.4. Total ascorbic acid {#fsn31012-sec-0016}\n------------------------\n\nAscorbic acid or vitamin C is an organic acid that is the most crucial vitamin for human nutrition. Ascorbic acid is synthesized in mitochondria and transported to other cell through proton--electron chemical gradient or through facilitated diffusion. It also has the ability to scavenge many types of free radicals. The main sources of ascorbic acid are fruits and vegetables. Ascorbic acid can fight against chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases and certain types of cancer (Aro & Ohad, [2003](#fsn31012-bib-0005){ref-type=\"ref\"}; Borland et al., [2006](#fsn31012-bib-0010){ref-type=\"ref\"}; Gil, Tom\u00e1s\u2010Barber\u00e1n, Hess\u2010Pierce, & Kader, [2002](#fsn31012-bib-0017){ref-type=\"ref\"}).\n\nThe total ascorbic acid can be determined by using 1% phosphate citrate buffer (Davies & Masten, [1991](#fsn31012-bib-0013){ref-type=\"ref\"}). Briefly, fresh plant sample is extracted by using chilled pestle and mortar with the addition of 1% phosphate citrate buffer (pH 3.5). Next, the sample is homogenated and centrifuged at 14,000\u00a0x *g* for 10\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant is collected, and 1.72\u00a0mM of 2,6\u2010dichloroindophenol (2,6\u2010DCPIP) is added. The absorbance is immediately measured after mixing at 518\u00a0nm by using a spectrophotometer.\n\n5.5. Anthocyanin content {#fsn31012-sec-0017}\n------------------------\n\nAnthocyanins are chemicals that have a single aromatic structure known as cyaniding, which refers to a widely distributed pigment group found in the plant kingdom. The colors range from red to blue of the visible spectrum due to the water\u2010soluble pigments. The colors of these substances are varied due to addition or removal of hydroxyl groups or because of methylation or glycosylation (Harborne & Williams, [2000](#fsn31012-bib-0020){ref-type=\"ref\"}; Sakakibara, Honda, Nakagawa, Ashida, & Kanazawa, [2003](#fsn31012-bib-0032){ref-type=\"ref\"}).\n\nDetermination of anthocyanin content can be carried out based on the technique proposed by Bharti and Khurana ([2003](#fsn31012-bib-0008){ref-type=\"ref\"}). Briefly, fresh leaves are added into 10\u00a0ml of acidic methanol (1% v/v HCl) and the mixture is incubated overnight. To partition anthocyanin from chlorophyll, 10\u00a0ml of chloroform and 9\u00a0ml of double deionized water are added. The test tube is shaken gently, and the mixture is allowed to settle. The absorbance of the reaction mixture is measured at 505\u00a0nm.\n\n5.6. DPPH scavenging activity {#fsn31012-sec-0018}\n-----------------------------\n\nMolecule 1,1\u2010diphenyl\u20102\u2010picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) is classified as a stable free radical by virtue of the delocalization of the spare electron over the molecule as a whole that prevents it from dimerize. When a solution of DPPH is mixed, it donates hydrogen atom that reduces its form and loses its violet color.\n\nThe DPPH radical scavenging activity can be carried out by preparing 1\u00a0ml of sample extract in a test tube. Next, 2\u00a0ml of 1\u00a0mM of methanolic DPPH is added. The solution is mixed thoroughly and incubated for 30\u00a0min at 37\u00b0C. The blank sample is prepared without adding any standard or sample extract. The change in absorbance is measured at 515\u00a0nm, and the percentage of inhibition is calculated (Alhakmani, Kumar, & Khan, [2013](#fsn31012-bib-0002){ref-type=\"ref\"}).$$\\text{Inhibition}\\left( \\% \\right) = \\left\\lbrack {\\left( {\\text{A}_{515}\\,\\text{Control} - \\text{A}_{515}\\,\\text{Sample}} \\right)/\\text{A}_{515}\\,\\text{Control}} \\right\\rbrack \\times 100$$\n\n5.7. Ferric reducing\u2010antioxidant power (FRAP) assay {#fsn31012-sec-0019}\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nThe FRAP assay measures the reduction of ferric iron and 2,3,5\u2010triphenyl\u20101,3,4\u2010triaza\u2010azoniacyclopenta\u20101,4\u2010diene chloride to blue ferrous complex by antioxidants under acidic condition (pH 3.6). The FRAP unit is the reduction of one mole of Fe (lll) to Fe (ll).\n\nThe FRAP assay can be prepared based on the method described by Wong, Leong, and Koh ([2006](#fsn31012-bib-0038){ref-type=\"ref\"}). Briefly, 200\u00a0\u00b5l of sample extract is added with 3\u00a0ml of FRAP reagent that is prepared with a mixture of 300\u00a0mM of sodium acetate buffer (pH 3.6), 10\u00a0mM of 2,4,6\u2010tri(2pyridyl)\u2010s\u2010triazine (TPTZ) solution, and 20\u00a0mM of FeCl.6H~2~O at the ratio 10:1:1. The reaction mixture is incubated for 30\u00a0min at 37\u00b0C. Increment in absorbance is measured at 593\u00a0nm, and the percentage of inhibition (antioxidant) is calculated.$$\\text{Inhibition}\\left( \\text{antioxidant} \\right)\\left( \\% \\right) = \\left\\lbrack {\\left( {\\text{A}_{593}\\,\\text{Sample} - \\text{A}_{593}\\,\\text{Control}} \\right)/\\text{A}_{593}\\,\\text{Sample}} \\right\\rbrack\\, \\times 100$$\n\n5.8. Hydrogen peroxide (H~2~O~2~) scavenging activity {#fsn31012-sec-0020}\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nHydrogen peroxide is found naturally at low concentration levels in air, water, human body, plants, foods, and microorganism. H~2~O~2~may enter the human body by inhalation of vapor or mist and through eye or skin contact. Hydroxyl radicals (OH^\u2022^) are the by\u2010products of H~2~O~2~decomposed into oxygen and water that initiate lipid peroxidation and damages to DNA.\n\nIn order to determine the scavenging activity of hydrogen peroxide, 40\u00a0mM of hydrogen peroxide solution is prepared in 50\u00a0mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and the absorbance is measured at 230\u00a0nm. Next, 1\u00a0ml of sample extract or standard is added with 2\u00a0ml of hydrogen peroxide solution. After 10\u00a0min, the absorbance is measured against blank solution. The blank solution is prepared with phosphate buffer without adding hydrogen peroxide. Then, the percentage of hydrogen peroxide scavenge can be calculated (Nabavi, Ebrahimzadeh, Nabavi, Hamidinia, & Bekhradnia, [2008](#fsn31012-bib-0028){ref-type=\"ref\"}).$$\\text{H}_{2}\\text{O}_{2}{\\mspace{6mu}\\text{scavenge}}\\left( \\% \\right) = \\left\\lbrack {\\left( {\\text{A}_{230}\\,\\text{Control} - \\text{A}_{230}\\,\\text{Sample}} \\right)/\\text{A}_{230}\\,\\text{Control}} \\right\\rbrack \\times 100$$\n\n5.9. Nitric oxide scavenging activity {#fsn31012-sec-0021}\n-------------------------------------\n\nNO^\u2022^ is generated in biological tissues by specific NO synthase that metabolizes arginine to citrulline via five\u2010electron oxidative reaction. At a physiological pH of 7.2, the sodium nitroprusside compound is decomposed into aqueous solution and generates NO^\u2022^. Stable products (nitrate and nitrite) are produced when NO^\u2022^reacts with oxygen under aerobic condition, which can be determined by using the Griess reagent.\n\nThe scavenging activity of nitric oxide can be determined based on the method proposed by Marcocci, Maguire, Droylefaix, and Packer ([1994](#fsn31012-bib-0024){ref-type=\"ref\"}). Briefly, 2\u00a0ml of 10\u00a0mM of sodium nitroprusside is prepared in 0.5\u00a0ml of phosphate buffer saline (pH 7.4). Next, 0.5\u00a0ml of sample extract is added and incubated at 25\u00b0C. After 150\u00a0min of incubation, 0.5\u00a0ml of Griess reagent (1% sulfanilamide, 2% H~3~PO~4~, and 0.1% naphthylethylenediamine dihydrochloride) is added to 0.5\u00a0ml of incubated solution. The reaction mixture is re\u2010incubated for 30\u00a0min at room temperature. The rate of absorbance is measured at 546\u00a0nm, and the inhibition percentage is calculated.$$\\text{NO\\ inhibition} = \\left\\lbrack {\\left( {\\text{A}_{546}\\,\\text{Control} - \\text{A}_{546}\\,\\text{Sample}} \\right)/\\text{A}_{546}\\,\\text{Control}} \\right\\rbrack \\times 100$$\n\n5.10. Superoxide radical scavenging activity {#fsn31012-sec-0022}\n--------------------------------------------\n\nAlthough the superoxide anion is a weak oxidant, it can ultimately produce powerful and dangerous hydroxyl radicals and singlet oxygen, which contributes to oxidative stress.\n\nThis assay can be prepared based on the method developed by Robak and Gryglewski ([1988](#fsn31012-bib-0031){ref-type=\"ref\"}). The final mixture of 16\u00a0mM Tris\u2010HCl buffer at pH 8.0 (3\u00a0ml) is comprised of 0.3\u00a0mM of NBT (0.5\u00a0ml), 0.936\u00a0mM of NADH solution (0.5\u00a0ml), and 1\u00a0ml of sample extract. The mixture reaction is initiated by adding 0.5\u00a0ml of 0.12\u00a0mM phenazine methosulfate (PMS), and the mixture is incubated at 25\u00b0C for 5\u00a0min. The absorbance is measured at 560\u00a0nm against blank sample, and the percentage of inhibition is calculated.$$\\text{Inhibition}\\left( \\% \\right) = \\left( {1 - \\text{A}_{560}\\,\\text{Sample}/\\text{A}_{560}\\,\\text{Control}} \\right) \\times 100$$\n\n5.11. Hydroxyl radical scavenging activity {#fsn31012-sec-0023}\n------------------------------------------\n\nThe hydroxyl refers to a dangerous free radical that belongs to ROS. Hydroxyl radical reacts with polyunsaturated fatty acid moieties of cell membrane phospholipids, which can inflict damages to the human cell.\n\nThe ability displayed by hydroxyl radicals to scavenge can be determined by adhering to the method described by Kunchandy and Rao ([1990](#fsn31012-bib-0023){ref-type=\"ref\"}). The final mixture (1.0\u00a0ml) contains 28\u00a0mM of 2\u2010deoxy\u2010Dribose (100\u00a0\u00b5l) in 20\u00a0mM of potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 500\u00a0\u00b5l of sample extract, 1.04\u00a0mM of EDTA (200\u00a0\u00b5l) and 200\u00a0\u00b5M of FeCl~3~ (1:1 v/v), 1.0\u00a0mM of H~2~O~2~ (100\u00a0\u00b5l), and 1.0\u00a0mM of ascorbic acid (100\u00a0\u00b5l). Next, the mixture is incubated for an hour at 37\u00b0C. After that, 1.0\u00a0ml of 2.8% trichloroacetic acid and 1.0\u00a0ml of 1% thiobarbituric acid are added and the mixture is re\u2010incubated for 10\u00a0min at 100\u00b0C. The solution mixture is cooled on ice, and the absorbance rate is measured at 532\u00a0nm. After that, the extract is substituted with distilled water as blank, while the sample blank contains the sample solution, but without deoxyribose. Lastly, the inhibition percentage is calculated.$$\\text{Inhibition}\\left( \\% \\right) = \\left\\lbrack {\\text{A}_{532}\\,\\text{Blank} - \\left( {\\text{A}_{532}\\,\\text{Extract} - \\text{A}_{532}\\,\\text{Sample\\ blank}} \\right)/\\text{A}_{532}\\,\\text{Blank}} \\right\\rbrack \\times 100$$\n\n5.12. Phosphomolybdate assay (total antioxidant capacity) {#fsn31012-sec-0024}\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe total antioxidant capacity assay can be used to determine the capacity of antioxidants through the formation of phosphomolybdenum complex. The assay is based on the reduction of Mo (Vl) to Mo (V) by using sample analyte, which subsequently produces a green phosphate Mo (V) complex at acidic condition.\n\nBriefly, 0.1\u00a0ml of the sample extract is added to 0.3\u00a0ml of reagent solution that contains 0.6\u00a0M of sulfuric acid, 28\u00a0mM of sodium phosphate, and 4\u00a0mM of ammonium molybdate. The test tube is covered and incubated at 95\u00b0C for 90\u00a0min. After that, the mixture is cooled at room temperature and the absorbance is measured at 695\u00a0nm. The blank solution that functions as control contains both the reagent solution and the solvent. The total antioxidant capacity is calculated (Priya, Rajaram, & Suresh\u2010kumar, [2012](#fsn31012-bib-0030){ref-type=\"ref\"}).$$\\text{Total\\ antioxidant\\ capacity}\\left( \\% \\right) = \\left\\lbrack {\\left( {\\text{A}_{695}\\,\\text{Control} - \\text{A}_{695}\\,\\text{Sample}} \\right)/\\text{A}_{695}\\,\\text{Control}} \\right\\rbrack \\times 100$$\n\n5.13. Reducing power {#fsn31012-sec-0025}\n--------------------\n\nThe principle of this method is based on the increment of absorbance that indicates an increase in the antioxidant activity. Compounds with reducing power ability are electron donors and, hence, possess the ability to reduce the oxidized intermediate process of lipid peroxidation.\n\nBriefly, the reaction mixture contains 2.5\u00a0ml of sample extract, 2.5\u00a0ml of 0.2\u00a0M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.6), and 2.5\u00a0ml of 1% potassium ferric cyanide. Next, the reaction mixture is incubated at 50\u00b0C. After 20\u00a0min of incubation, 2.5\u00a0ml of 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and the mixture is centrifuged at 1,000 x *g*for 10\u00a0min. Then, 2.5\u00a0ml of the upper layer in the supernatant is collected and mixed with 2.5\u00a0ml of distilled water and 0.5\u00a0ml of 0.1% ferric chloride. The absorbance of reaction mixture is measured at 700\u00a0nm against blank, which consists of all reagents without the sample extract (Gulcin, Tel, & Kirecci, [2008](#fsn31012-bib-0018){ref-type=\"ref\"}).\n\n5.14. Metal ion chelating activity {#fsn31012-sec-0026}\n----------------------------------\n\nFormation of chelates with Fe^2+^ ~,~ferrozine can generate a complex that is red in color. Nevertheless, the fading of red shade in ferrozine\u2010Fe^2+^ complexes is only restricted in the presence of other chelating agents. The measurement of the reduced color determines the chelating activity that competes with ferrozine for ferrous ion.\n\nBriefly, 800\u00a0\u00b5l of sample extract is added to 2\u00a0mM of ferrous chloride (100\u00a0\u00b5l). In order to initiate the reaction, 5\u00a0mM of ferrozine (400\u00a0\u00b5l) is added and the mixture is incubated for 10\u00a0min at room temperature. The absorbance of the mixture is measured at 562\u00a0nm against the blank sample. Citric acid or EDTA can serve as control, whereas distilled water can function as blank. The capacity to chelate ferrous ion is calculated (Prieto, Pineda, & Aguilar, [1999](#fsn31012-bib-0029){ref-type=\"ref\"}).$$\\text{Chelation}\\left( \\% \\right) = \\left\\lbrack {1 - \\left( {\\text{A}_{562}\\,\\text{Sample}/\\text{A}_{562}\\,\\text{Control}} \\right)} \\right\\rbrack \\times 100$$\n\n5.15. \u03b2\u2010carotene/linoleic acid bleaching {#fsn31012-sec-0027}\n----------------------------------------\n\n\u03b2\u2010carotene bleaching is one of the fastest methods that can be employed to screen antioxidants based on the principle that linoleic acid, which is an unsaturated fatty acid, gets oxidized by ROS that is produced by oxygenated water. The produced resultant can initiate the oxidation of \u03b2\u2010carotene, thus leading to discoloration.\n\nIn brief, \u03b2\u2010carotene (0.2\u00a0mg/ml) is dissolved in chloroform and added into a round bottom flask, along with 20\u00a0\u00b5l of linoleic acid and 200\u00a0\u00b5l of Tween 20. A volume of 200\u00a0\u00b5l of the sample extract, either control or standard, is added. The mixture is evaporated at room temperature to dry under vacuum. Next, 50\u00a0ml of distilled water is added and the mixture is shaken to form a liposome solution. The initial absorbance (Abs^0^) of the mixture is measured at 470\u00a0nm. After that, the remaining solution is placed in water bath at 50\u00b0C for 120\u00a0min and the absorbance is recorded at 470\u00a0nm (Abs^120^). As for the control solution, 80% of methanol excluding sample extract can be used. The percentage of antioxidant activity is calculated (Dastmalchi, Dorman, Laakso, & Hiltunen, [2007](#fsn31012-bib-0012){ref-type=\"ref\"}).$$\\text{Antioxidant}\\left( \\% \\right) = \\left\\lbrack {1 - \\left( {\\text{Abs}^{0}\\,\\text{Sample} - \\text{Abs}^{120}\\,\\text{Sample}} \\right)/\\left( {\\text{Abs}^{0}\\,\\text{Control} - \\text{Abs}^{120}\\,\\text{Sample}} \\right)} \\right\\rbrack \\times 100$$\n\n6. PRECAUTIONS, REPEATABILITY, AND LIMIT OF DETECTION {#fsn31012-sec-0028}\n=====================================================\n\nPerforming an in vitro antioxidant assay requires several precautions in order to reduce error. Both the enzymatic and nonenzymatic in vitro antioxidant assays need to be conducted in a dark room. An antioxidant is a sensitive compound that easily deteriorates when exposed to light. Alternative to using a dark room, preparation of samples also can be performed by covering the flasks with aluminum foil or by using amber glass bottles. Enzymatic antioxidant assay needs to be performed in a cold room (approximately 4\u00b0C) due to higher rate of fluctuations. In an in vitro antioxidant assay, the reagents used need to be freshly prepared as the reactivity of the reagents decreases with time. Preferably, extraction of samples needs to be prepared fresh prior to carrying out the assay. Although samples can be stored in a freezer (at \u22124 to \u221280\u00b0C) for several days, antioxidant activity is generally lower as compared to freshly prepared samples.\n\nRepeat of in vitro antioxidant assay is usually conducted to increase precision and yield more accurate results. In order to establish repeatability, an in vitro antioxidant assay needs to be conducted in the same place, using the same procedures and instruments. Environmental conditions such as room temperature and light intensity need to be adjusted to same. An in vitro antioxidant assay for each sample needs to be repeated for at least three times, and an average reading is calculated. With the average of readings, a standard deviation and a standard error can be obtained. Significance of results is determined by conducting statistical analysis. Comparison between samples of antioxidant activity can be analyzed by calculating IC~50~ values. IC~50~ is defined as the concentration of sample required to exhibit 50% of free radical inhibition. The lower the amount of sample required to inhibit 50% of free radicals, the greater the antioxidant activity of the sample.\n\nLimit of detection (LOD) is defined as the lowest amount or concentration of test samples that can be detected from zero. Prior to calculating the LOD, a calibration curve of sample needs to be plotted and linear equation be obtained. The limit of detection is calculated by using the formula (Yilmaz, Sadikoglu, Saglikoglu, Yagmur, & Askin, [2008](#fsn31012-bib-0040){ref-type=\"ref\"}):$$\\text{Limit\\ of\\ detection} = 3\\, s/m$$where *s* is the standard deviation and *m*is the slope.\n\n7. CONCLUSION {#fsn31012-sec-0029}\n=============\n\nAt present, researches pertaining to antioxidant compounds from plant sources have attracted attention across the globe due to its therapeutically and pharmacologically potent properties with low or no side effects to human.
