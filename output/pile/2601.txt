EPA, 549 U.S. 497 (2007)\u2014which clarified\nthat greenhouse gases are an \u201cair pollutant\u201d subject to regulation\nunder the Clean Air Act (CAA)\u2014the Environmental Protection\nAgency promulgated a series of greenhouse gas-related rules.\nFirst, EPA issued an Endangerment Finding, in which it\ndetermined that greenhouse gases may \u201creasonably be\nanticipated to endanger public health or welfare.\u201d See 42 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 7521(a)(1). Next, it issued the Tailpipe Rule, which set\nemission standards for cars and light trucks. Finally, EPA\ndetermined that the CAA requires major stationary sources of\ngreenhouse gases to obtain construction and operating permits.\nBut because immediate regulation of all such sources would\nresult in overwhelming permitting burdens on permitting\n\f                                16\n\nauthorities and sources, EPA issued the Timing and Tailoring\nRules, in which it determined that only the largest stationary\nsources would initially be subject to permitting requirements.\n\n     Petitioners, various states and industry groups, challenge all\nthese rules, arguing that they are based on improper\nconstructions of the CAA and are otherwise arbitrary and\ncapricious. But for the reasons set forth below, we conclude: 1)\nthe Endangerment Finding and Tailpipe Rule are neither\narbitrary nor capricious; 2) EPA\u2019s interpretation of the\ngoverning CAA provisions is unambiguously correct; and 3) no\npetitioner has standing to challenge the Timing and Tailoring\nRules. We thus dismiss for lack of jurisdiction all petitions for\nreview of the Timing and Tailoring Rules, and deny the\nremainder of the petitions.\n\n                                I.\n\n     We begin with a brief primer on greenhouse gases. As their\nname suggests, when released into the atmosphere, these gases\nact \u201clike the ceiling of a greenhouse, trapping solar energy and\nretarding the escape of reflected heat.\u201d Massachusetts v. EPA,\n549 U.S. at 505. A wide variety of modern human activities\nresult in greenhouse gas emissions; cars, power plants, and\nindustrial sites all release significant amounts of these heat-\ntrapping gases. In recent decades \u201c[a] well-documented rise in\nglobal temperatures has coincided with a significant increase in\nthe concentration of [greenhouse gases] in the atmosphere.\u201d Id.\nat 504-05. Many scientists believe that mankind\u2019s greenhouse\ngas emissions are driving this climate change. These scientists\npredict that global climate change will cause a host of\ndeleterious consequences, including drought, increasingly severe\nweather events, and rising sea levels.\n\n    The genesis of this litigation came in 2007, when the\n\f                               17\n\nSupreme Court held in Massachusetts v. EPA that greenhouse\ngases \u201cunambiguous[ly]\u201d may be regulated as an \u201cair pollutant\u201d\nunder the Clean Air Act (\u201cCAA\u201d). Id. at 529. Squarely rejecting\nthe contention\u2014then advanced by EPA\u2014that \u201cgreenhouse gases\ncannot be \u2018air pollutants\u2019 within the meaning of the Act,\u201d id. at\n513, the Court held that the CAA\u2019s definition of \u201cair pollutant\u201d\n\u201cembraces all airborne compounds of whatever stripe.\u201d Id. at\n529 (emphasis added). Moreover, because the CAA requires\nEPA to establish motor-vehicle emission standards for \u201cany air\npollutant . . . which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger\npublic health or welfare,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7521(a)(1) (emphasis\nadded), the Court held that EPA had a \u201cstatutory obligation\u201d to\nregulate harmful greenhouse gases. Id. at 534. \u201cUnder the clear\nterms of the Clean Air Act,\u201d the Court concluded, \u201cEPA can\navoid taking further action only if it determines that greenhouse\ngases do not contribute to climate change or if it provides some\nreasonable explanation as to why it cannot or will not exercise\nits discretion to determine whether they do.\u201d Id. at 533. The\nCourt thus directed EPA to determine \u201cwhether sufficient\ninformation exists to make an endangerment finding\u201d for\ngreenhouse gases. Id. at 534.\n\n     Massachusetts v. EPA spurred a cascading series of\ngreenhouse gas-related rules and regulations. First, in direct\nresponse to the Supreme Court\u2019s directive, EPA issued an\nEndangerment Finding for greenhouse gases. Endangerment and\nCause or Contribute Findings for Greenhouse Gases Under\nSection 202(a) of the Clean Air Act (\u201cEndangerment Finding\u201d),\n74 Fed. Reg. 66,496 (Dec. 15, 2009). The Endangerment\nFinding defined as a single \u201cair pollutant\u201d an \u201caggregate group\nof six long-lived and directly-emitted greenhouse gases\u201d that are\n\u201cwell mixed\u201d together in the atmosphere and cause global\nclimate change: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide,\nhydroflourocarbons, perflourocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride.\nId. at 66,536-37. Following \u201ccommon practice,\u201d EPA measured\n\f                               18\n\nthe impact of these gases on a \u201ccarbon dioxide equivalent basis,\u201d\n(CO2e) which is based on the gases\u2019 \u201cwarming effect relative to\ncarbon dioxide . . . over a specified timeframe.\u201d Id. at 66,519.\n(Using the carbon dioxide equivalent equation, for example, a\nmixture of X amount of nitrous oxide and Y amount of sulfur\nhexafluoride is expressed as Z amount of CO2e). After\ncompiling and considering a considerable body of scientific\nevidence, EPA concluded that motor-vehicle emissions of these\nsix well-mixed gases \u201ccontribute to the total greenhouse gas air\npollution, and thus to the climate change problem, which is\nreasonably anticipated to endanger public health and welfare.\u201d\nId. at 66,499.\n\n      Next, and pursuant to the CAA\u2019s requirement that EPA\nestablish motor-vehicle emission standards for \u201cany air pollutant\n. . . which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public\nhealth or welfare,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7521(a)(1), the agency\npromulgated its Tailpipe Rule for greenhouse gases. Light-Duty\nVehicle Greenhouse Gas Emission Standards and Corporate\nAverage Fuel Economy Standards; Final Rule (\u201cTailpipe\nRule\u201d), 75 Fed. Reg. 25,324 (May 7, 2010). Effective January 2,\n2011, the Tailpipe Rule set greenhouse gas emission standards\nfor cars and light trucks as part of a joint rulemaking with fuel\neconomy standards issued by the National Highway Traffic\nSafety Administration (NHTSA). Id. at 25,326.\n\n     Under EPA\u2019s longstanding interpretation of the CAA, the\nTailpipe Rule automatically triggered regulation of stationary\ngreenhouse gas emitters under two separate sections of the Act.\nThe first, the Prevention of Significant Deterioration of Air\nQuality (PSD) program, requires state-issued construction\npermits for certain types of stationary sources\u2014for example,\niron and steel mill plants\u2014if they have the potential to emit over\n100 tons per year (tpy) of \u201cany air pollutant.\u201d See 42 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 7475; 7479(1). All other stationary sources are subject to PSD\n\f                               19\n\npermitting if they have the potential to emit over 250 tpy of \u201cany\nair pollutant.\u201d Id. \u00a7 7479(1). The second provision, Title V,\nrequires state-issued operating permits for stationary sources\nthat have the potential to emit at least 100 tpy of \u201cany air\npollutant.\u201d Id. \u00a7 7602(j). EPA has long interpreted the phrase\n\u201cany air pollutant\u201d in both these provisions to mean any air\npollutant that is regulated under the CAA. See Requirements for\nPreparation, Adoption, and Submittal of Implementation Plans;\nApproval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans (\u201c1980\nImplementation Plan Requirements\u201d), 45 Fed. Reg. 52,676,\n52,711 (Aug. 7, 1980) (PSD program); Prevention of Significant\nDeterioration and Title V Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule\n(\u201cTailoring Rule\u201d), 75 Fed. Reg. 31,514, 31,553-54 (June 3,\n2010) (discussing history of Title V regulation and\napplicability). And once the Tailpipe Rule set motor-vehicle\nemission standards for greenhouse gases, they became a\nregulated pollutant under the Act, requiring PSD and Title V\ngreenhouse permitting.\n\n     Acting pursuant to this longstanding interpretation of the\nPSD and Title V programs, EPA issued two rules phasing in\nstationary source greenhouse gas regulation. First, in the Timing\nRule, EPA concluded that an air pollutant becomes \u201csubject to\nregulation\u201d under the Clean Air Act\u2014and thus subject to PSD\nand Title V permitting\u2014only once a regulation requiring control\nof that pollutant takes effect. Reconsideration of Interpretation\nof Regulations That Determine Pollutants Covered by Clean Air\nAct Permitting Programs (\u201cTiming Rule\u201d), 75 Fed. Reg. 17,004\n(Apr. 2, 2010). Therefore, EPA concluded, major stationary\nemitters of greenhouse gases would be subject to PSD and Title\nV permitting regulations on January 2, 2011\u2014the date on which\nthe Tailpipe Rule became effective, and thus, the date when\ngreenhouse gases first became regulated under the CAA. Id. at\n17,019.\n\f                              20\n\n     Next, EPA promulgated the Tailoring Rule. In the Tailoring\nRule, EPA noted that greenhouse gases are emitted in far greater\nvolumes than other pollutants. Indeed, millions of industrial,\nresidential, and commercial sources exceed the 100/250 tpy\nstatutory emissions threshold for CO2e. Tailoring Rule, 75 Fed.\nReg. at 31,534-36. Immediately adding these sources to the PSD\nand Title V programs would, EPA predicted, result in\ntremendous costs to industry and state permitting authorities.\nSee id. As a result, EPA announced that it was \u201crelieving\noverwhelming permitting burdens that would, in the absence of\nthis rule, fall on permitting authorities and sources.\u201d Id. at\n31,516. Departing from the CAA\u2019s 100/250 tpy emissions\nthreshold, the Tailoring Rule provided that only the largest\nsources\u2014those exceeding 75,000 or 100,000 tpy CO2e,\ndepending on the program and project\u2014would initially be\nsubject to greenhouse gas permitting. Id. at 31,523. (The\nTailoring Rule further provided that regulated sources must also\nemit greenhouse gases at levels that exceed the 100/250 tpy\nemissions threshold on a mass basis. That is, they must emit\nover 100/250 tpy of actual pollutants, in addition to exceeding\nthe 75,000/100,000 tpy carbon dioxide equivalent. Id. at\n31,523.)\n\n     A number of groups\u2014including states and regulated\nindustries\u2014filed petitions for review of EPA\u2019s greenhouse gas\nregulations, contending that the agency misconstrued the CAA\nand otherwise acted arbitrarily and capriciously. This appeal\nconsolidates the petitions for review of the four aforementioned\nrules: the Endangerment Finding, the Tailpipe Rule, the Timing\nRule, and the Tailoring Rule.\n\n    \u201cThe Clean Air Act empowers us to reverse the\nAdministrator\u2019s action in rulemaking if it is \u2018arbitrary,\ncapricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in\naccordance with the law.\u2019\u201d Med. Waste Inst. & Energy Recovery\n\f                                21\n\nCouncil v. EPA, 645 F.3d 420, 424 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (quoting 42\nU.S.C. \u00a7 7607(d)(9)(A)). Questions of statutory interpretation\nare governed by the familiar Chevron two-step: \u201cFirst . . . if the\nintent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the\ncourt, as well as the agency, must give effect to the\nunambiguously expressed intent of Congress.\u201d Chevron, U.S.A.\nInc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837,\n842-43 (1984). But \u201cif the statute is silent or ambiguous with\nrespect to the specific issue, the question for the court is whether\nthe agency\u2019s answer is based on a permissible construction of\nthe statute.\u201d Id. at 843.\n\n     This opinion proceeds in several steps. Part II explains why\nthe Endangerment Finding was neither arbitrary nor capricious,\nwhile Part III does the same for the Tailpipe Rule. Turning to\nstationary source regulation, Part IV examines whether any\npetitioners may timely challenge EPA\u2019s longstanding\ninterpretation of the PSD statute. Because we conclude that they\nmay, Part V addresses the merits of their statutory arguments,\nand explains why EPA\u2019s interpretation of the CAA was\ncompelled by the statute. Next, Part VI explains why petitioners\nlack standing to challenge the Timing and Tailoring Rules\nthemselves. Finally, Part VII disposes of several arguments that\nhave nothing to do with the rules under review, and thus are not\nproperly before us.\n\n                                II.\n\n     We turn first to State and Industry Petitioners\u2019 challenges\nto the Endangerment Finding, the first of the series of rules EPA\nissued after the Supreme Court remanded Massachusetts v. EPA.\nIn the decision ordering the remand, the Supreme Court held\nthat EPA had failed in its statutory obligations when it \u201coffered\nno reasoned explanation for its refusal to decide whether\ngreenhouse gases cause or contribute to climate change.\u201d\n\f                                22\n\nMassachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. at 534. On remand, EPA\ncompiled a substantial scientific record, which is before us in the\npresent review, and determined that \u201cgreenhouse gases in the\natmosphere may reasonably be anticipated both to endanger\npublic health and to endanger public welfare.\u201d Endangerment\nFinding, 74 Fed. Reg. at 66,497. EPA went on to find that\nmotor-vehicle emissions of greenhouse gases \u201ccontribute to the\ntotal greenhouse gas air pollution, and thus to the climate change\nproblem, which is reasonably anticipated to endanger public\nhealth and welfare.\u201d Id. at 66,499.\n\n     State and Industry Petitioners challenge several aspects of\nEPA\u2019s decision, including (1) EPA\u2019s interpretation of CAA\n\u00a7 202(a)(1), which sets out the endangerment-finding standard;\n(2) the adequacy of the scientific record supporting the\nEndangerment Finding; (3) EPA\u2019s decision not to \u201cquantify\u201d the\nrisk of endangerment to public health or welfare created by\nclimate change; (4) EPA\u2019s choice to define the \u201cair pollutant\u201d at\nissue as an aggregate of six greenhouse gases; (5) EPA\u2019s failure\nto consult its Science Advisory Board before issuing the\nEndangerment Finding; and (6) EPA\u2019s denial of all petitions for\nreconsideration of the Endangerment Finding. We ultimately\nconclude that the Endangerment Finding is consistent with\nMassachusetts v. EPA and the text and structure of the CAA,\nand is adequately supported by the administrative record.\n\n                                A.\n\n     Industry Petitioners contend that EPA improperly\ninterpreted CAA \u00a7 202(a)(1) as restricting the Endangerment\nFinding to a science-based judgment devoid of considerations of\npolicy concerns and regulatory consequences. They assert that\nCAA \u00a7 202(a)(1) requires EPA to consider, e.g., the benefits of\nactivities that require greenhouse gas emissions, the\neffectiveness of emissions regulation triggered by the\n\f                               23\n\nEndangerment Finding, and the potential for societal adaptation\nto or mitigation of climate change. They maintain that\neschewing those considerations also made the Endangerment\nFinding arbitrary and capricious.\n\n     These contentions are foreclosed by the language of the\nstatute and the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Massachusetts v.\nEPA. Section 202(a) of the CAA states in relevant part that\nEPA\u2019s Administrator\n\n         shall by regulation prescribe (and from time to time\n         revise) in accordance with the provisions of this\n         section, standards applicable to the emission of any air\n         pollutant from any class or classes of new motor\n         vehicles or new motor vehicle engines, which in his\n         judgment cause, or contribute to, air pollution which\n         may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public\n         health or welfare.\n\n 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7521(a)(1). This language requires that the\nendangerment evaluation \u201crelate to whether an air pollutant\n\u2018cause[s], or contribute[s] to, air pollution which may reasonably\nbe anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.\u2019\u201d\nMassachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. at 532\u201333. At bottom,\n\u00a7 202(a)(1) requires EPA to answer only two questions: whether\nparticular \u201cair pollution\u201d\u2014here, greenhouse gases\u2014\u201cmay\nreasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare,\u201d\nand whether motor-vehicle emissions \u201ccause, or contribute to\u201d\nthat endangerment.\n\n    These questions require a \u201cscientific judgment\u201d about the\npotential risks greenhouse gas emissions pose to public health or\nwelfare\u2014not policy discussions. Massachusetts v. EPA, 549\nU.S. at 534. In Massachusetts v. EPA, the Supreme Court\nrebuffed an attempt by EPA itself to inject considerations of\n\f                                24\n\npolicy into its decision. At the time, EPA had \u201coffered a laundry\nlist of reasons not to regulate\u201d greenhouse gases, including\n\n         that a number of voluntary Executive Branch programs\n         already provide an effective response to the threat of\n         global warming, that regulating greenhouse gases\n         might impair the President\u2019s ability to negotiate with\n         \u201ckey developing nations\u201d to reduce emissions, and that\n         curtailing motor-vehicle emissions would reflect \u201can\n         inefficient, piecemeal approach to address the climate\n         change issue.\u201d\n\n Id. at 533 (citations omitted). The Court noted that \u201cthese policy\njudgments . . . have nothing to do with whether greenhouse gas\nemissions contribute to climate change. Still less do they amount\nto a reasoned justification for declining to form a scientific\njudgment.\u201d Id. at 533\u201334. In the Court\u2019s view, EPA\u2019s policy-\nbased explanations contained \u201cno reasoned explanation for\n[EPA\u2019s] refusal to decide\u201d the key part of the endangerment\ninquiry: \u201cwhether greenhouse gases cause or contribute to\nclimate change.\u201d Id. at 534.\n\n     As in Massachusetts v. EPA, a \u201claundry list of reasons not\nto regulate\u201d simply has \u201cnothing to do with whether greenhouse\ngas emissions contribute to climate change.\u201d Id. at 533\u201334. The\nadditional exercises State and Industry Petitioners would have\nEPA undertake\u2014e.g., performing a cost-benefit analysis for\ngreenhouse gases, gauging the effectiveness of whatever\nemission standards EPA would enact to limit greenhouse gases,\nand predicting society\u2019s adaptive response to the dangers or\nharms caused by climate change\u2014do not inform the \u201cscientific\njudgment\u201d that \u00a7 202(a)(1) requires of EPA. Instead of focusing\non the question whether greenhouse gas emissions may\nreasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare,\nthe factors State and Industry Petitioners put forth only address\n\f                              25\n\nwhat might happen were EPA to answer that question in the\naffirmative. As EPA stated in the Endangerment Finding, such\ninquiries \u201cmuddle the rather straightforward scientific judgment\nabout whether there may be endangerment by throwing the\npotential impact of responding to the danger into the initial\nquestion.\u201d 74 Fed. Reg. at 66,515. To be sure, the subsection\nfollowing \u00a7 202(a)(1), \u00a7 202(a)(2), requires that EPA address\nlimited questions about the cost of compliance with new\nemission standards and the availability of technology for\nmeeting those standards, see infra Part III, but these judgments\nare not part of the \u00a7 202(a)(1) endangerment inquiry. The\nSupreme Court made clear in Massachusetts v. EPA that it was\nnot addressing the question \u201cwhether policy concerns can inform\nEPA\u2019s actions in the event that it makes such a finding,\u201d 549\nU.S. at 534\u201335, but that policy concerns were not part of the\ncalculus for the determination of the endangerment finding in\nthe first instance. The Supreme Court emphasized that it was\nholding \u201cthat EPA must ground its reasons for action or inaction\nin the statute.\u201d Id. at 535. The statute speaks in terms of\nendangerment, not in terms of policy, and EPA has complied\nwith the statute.\n\n     State and Industry Petitioners insist that because statutes\nshould be interpreted to avoid absurd results, EPA should have\nconsidered at least the \u201cabsurd\u201d consequences that would follow\nfrom an endangerment finding for greenhouse gases.\nSpecifically: having made an endangerment finding, EPA will\nproceed to promulgate emission standards under \u00a7 202(a)(1).\nIssuing those standards triggers regulation\u2014under EPA\u2019s PSD\nand Title V programs\u2014of stationary sources that emit\ngreenhouse gases at levels above longstanding statutory\nthresholds. Because greenhouse gases are emitted in much\nhigher volumes than other air pollutants, hundreds of thousands\nof small stationary sources would exceed those thresholds. This\nwould subject those sources to PSD and Title V permitting\n\f                               26\n\nrequirements despite what Petitioners claim was Congress\u2019s\nclear intent that the requirements apply only to large industrial\nsources. Petitioners assert that even EPA believed such\noverbroad regulation to be an absurd result, which it attempted\nto rectify by adopting the Tailoring Rule to raise the statutory\nthresholds, see infra Part VI.\n\n     However \u201cabsurd\u201d Petitioners consider this consequence,\nthough, it is still irrelevant to the endangerment inquiry. That\nEPA adjusted the statutory thresholds to accommodate\nregulation of greenhouse gases emitted by stationary sources\nmay indicate that the CAA is a regulatory scheme less-than-\nperfectly tailored to dealing with greenhouse gases. But the\nSupreme Court has already held that EPA indeed wields the\nauthority to regulate greenhouse gases under the CAA. See\nMassachusetts v. EPA. The plain language of \u00a7 202(a)(1) of that\nAct does not leave room for EPA to consider as part of the\nendangerment inquiry the stationary-source regulation triggered\nby an endangerment finding, even if the degree of regulation\ntriggered might at a later stage be characterized as \u201cabsurd.\u201d\n\n                               B.\n\n     State and Industry Petitioners next challenge the adequacy\nof the scientific record underlying the Endangerment Finding,\nobjecting to both the type of evidence upon which EPA relied\nand EPA\u2019s decision to make an Endangerment Finding in light\nof what Industry Petitioners view as significant scientific\nuncertainty. Neither objection has merit.\n\n                               1.\n\n    As an initial matter, State and Industry Petitioners question\nEPA\u2019s reliance on \u201cmajor assessments\u201d addressing greenhouse\ngases and climate change issued by the Intergovernmental Panel\n\f                               27\n\non Climate Change (IPCC), the U.S. Global Climate Research\nProgram (USGCRP), and the National Research Council (NRC).\nEndangerment Finding, 74 Fed. Reg. at 66,510\u201311. These peer-\nreviewed assessments synthesized thousands of individual\nstudies on various aspects of greenhouse gases and climate\nchange and drew \u201coverarching conclusions\u201d about the state of\nthe science in this field. Id. at 66,511. The assessments provide\ndata and information on, inter alia, \u201cthe amount of greenhouse\ngases being emitted by human activities\u201d; their continued\naccumulation in the atmosphere; the resulting observed changes\nto Earth\u2019s energy balance, temperature and climate at global and\nregional levels, and other \u201cclimate-sensitive sectors and systems\nof the human and natural environment\u201d; the extent to which\nthese changes \u201ccan be attributed to human-induced buildup of\natmospheric greenhouse gases\u201d; \u201cfuture projected climate\nchange\u201d; and \u201cprojected risks and impacts to human health,\nsociety and the environment.\u201dId. at 66,510\u201311.\n\n\n     State and Industry Petitioners assert that EPA improperly\n\u201cdelegated\u201d its judgment to the IPCC, USGCRP, and NRC by\nrelying on these assessments of climate-change science. See U.S.\nTelecom Ass\u2019n v. FCC, 359 F.3d 554, 566 (D.C. Cir. 2004). This\nargument is little more than a semantic trick. EPA did not\ndelegate, explicitly or otherwise, any decision-making to any of\nthose entities. EPA simply did here what it and other decision-\nmakers often must do to make a science-based judgment: it\nsought out and reviewed existing scientific evidence to\ndetermine whether a particular finding was warranted. It makes\nno difference that much of the scientific evidence in large part\nconsisted of \u201csyntheses\u201d of individual studies and research.\nEven individual studies and research papers often synthesize\npast work in an area and then build upon it. This is how science\nworks. EPA is not required to re-prove the existence of the atom\nevery time it approaches a scientific question.\n\f                               28\n\n\n     Moreover, it appears from the record that EPA used the\nassessment reports not as substitutes for its own judgment but as\nevidence upon which it relied to make that judgment. EPA\nevaluated the processes used to develop the various assessment\nreports, reviewed their contents, and considered the depth of the\nscientific consensus the reports represented. Based on these\nevaluations, EPA determined the assessments represented the\nbest source material to use in deciding whether greenhouse gas\nemissions may be reasonably anticipated to endanger public\nhealth or welfare. Endangerment Finding, 74 Fed. Reg. at\n66,510\u201311. It then reviewed those reports along with comments\nrelevant to the scientific considerations involved to determine\nwhether the evidence warranted an endangerment finding for\ngreenhouse gases as it was required to do under the Supreme\nCourt\u2019s mandate in Massachusetts v. EPA.\n\n                                2.\n\n     Industry Petitioners also assert that the scientific evidence\ndoes not adequately support the Endangerment Finding. As we\nhave stated before in reviewing the science-based decisions of\nagencies such as EPA, \u201c[a]lthough we perform a searching and\ncareful inquiry into the facts underlying the agency\u2019s decisions,\nwe will presume the validity of agency action as long as a\nrational basis for it is presented.\u201d Am. Farm Bureau Fed\u2019n v.\nEPA, 559 F.3d 512, 519 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). In so doing, \u201cwe give an extreme degree of\ndeference to the agency when it is evaluating scientific data\nwithin its technical expertise.\u201d Id. (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n\n    The body of scientific evidence marshaled by EPA in\nsupport of the Endangerment Finding is substantial. EPA\u2019s\nscientific evidence of record included support for the proposition\n\f                               29\n\nthat greenhouse gases trap heat on earth that would otherwise\ndissipate into space; that this \u201cgreenhouse effect\u201d warms the\nclimate; that human activity is contributing to increased\natmospheric levels of greenhouse gases; and that the climate\nsystem is warming.\n\n     Based on this scientific record, EPA made the linchpin\nfinding: in its judgment, the \u201croot cause\u201d of the recently\nobserved climate change is \u201cvery likely\u201d the observed increase\nin anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Endangerment\nFinding, 74 Fed. Reg. at 66,518. EPA found support for this\nfinding in three lines of evidence. First, it drew upon our \u201cbasic\nphysical understanding\u201d of the impacts of various natural and\nmanmade changes on the climate system. For instance, EPA\nrelied on evidence that the past half-century of warming has\noccurred at a time when natural forces such as solar and\nvolcanic activity likely would have produced cooling.\nEndangerment Finding, Response to Comments (RTC) Vol. 3,\nat 20. Other evidence supports EPA\u2019s conclusion that the\nobserved warming pattern\u2014warming of the bottommost layer\nof the atmosphere and cooling immediately above it\u2014is\nconsistent with greenhouse-gas causation. Id.\n\n     EPA further relied upon evidence of historical estimates of\npast climate change, supporting EPA\u2019s conclusion that global\ntemperatures over the last half-century are unusual.\nEndangerment Finding, 74 Fed. Reg. at 66,518. Scientific\nstudies upon which EPA relied place high confidence in the\nassertion that global mean surface temperatures over the last few\ndecades are higher than at any time in the last four centuries.\nTechnical Support Document for the Endangerment Finding\n(TSD), at 31. These studies also show, albeit with significant\nuncertainty, that temperatures at many individual locations were\nhigher over the last twenty-five years than during any period of\ncomparable length since 900 A.D. Id.\n\f                                30\n\n     For its third line of evidence that anthropogenic emissions\nof greenhouse gases spurred the perceived warming trend, EPA\nturned to computer-based climate-model simulations. Scientists\nhave used global climate models built on basic principles of\nphysics and scientific knowledge about the climate to try to\nsimulate the recent climate change. These models have only\nbeen able to replicate the observed warming by including\nanthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases in the simulations.\nEndangerment Finding, 74 Fed. Reg. at 66,523.\n\n     To recap, EPA had before it substantial record evidence that\nanthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases \u201cvery likely\u201d\ncaused warming of the climate over the last several decades.\nEPA further had evidence of current and future effects of this\nwarming on public health and welfare. Relying again upon\nsubstantial scientific evidence, EPA determined that\nanthropogenically induced climate change threatens both public\nhealth and public welfare. It found that extreme weather events,\nchanges in air quality, increases in food- and water-borne\npathogens, and increases in temperatures are likely to have\nadverse health effects. Id. at 66,497\u201398. The record also\nsupports EPA\u2019s conclusion that climate change endangers\nhuman welfare by creating risk to food production and\nagriculture, forestry, energy, infrastructure, ecosystems, and\nwildlife. Substantial evidence further supported EPA\u2019s\nconclusion that the warming resulting from the greenhouse gas\nemissions could be expected to create risks to water resources\nand in general to coastal areas as a result of expected increase in\nsea level. Id. at 66,498. Finally, EPA determined from\nsubstantial evidence that motor-vehicle emissions of greenhouse\ngases contribute to climate change and thus to the endangerment\nof public health and welfare.\n\n    Industry Petitioners do not find fault with much of the\nsubstantial record EPA amassed in support of the Endangerment\n\f                                31\n\nFinding. Rather, they contend that the record evidences too\nmuch uncertainty to support that judgment. But the existence of\nsome uncertainty does not, without more, warrant invalidation\nof an endangerment finding. If a statute is \u201cprecautionary in\nnature\u201d and \u201cdesigned to protect the public health,\u201d and the\nrelevant evidence is \u201cdifficult to come by, uncertain, or\nconflicting because it is on the frontiers of scientific\nknowledge,\u201d EPA need not provide \u201crigorous step-by-step proof\nof cause and effect\u201d to support an endangerment finding. Ethyl\nCorp. v. EPA, 541 F.2d 1, 28 (D.C. Cir. 1976). As we have\nstated before, \u201cAwaiting certainty will often allow for only\nreactive, not preventive, regulation.\u201d Id. at 25.\n\n     Congress did not restrict EPA to remedial regulation when\nit enacted CAA \u00a7 202(a). That section mandates that EPA\npromulgate new emission standards if it determines that the air\npollution at issue \u201cmay reasonably be anticipated to endanger\npublic health or welfare.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7521(a)(1). This language\nrequires a precautionary, forward-looking scientific judgment\nabout the risks of a particular air pollutant, consistent with the\nCAA\u2019s \u201cprecautionary and preventive orientation.\u201d Lead Indus.\nAss\u2019n, Inc. v. EPA, 647 F.2d 1130, 1155 (D.C. Cir. 1980).\nRequiring that EPA find \u201ccertain\u201d endangerment of public\nhealth or welfare before regulating greenhouse gases would\neffectively prevent EPA from doing the job Congress gave it in\n\u00a7 202(a)\u2014utilizing emission standards to prevent reasonably\nanticipated endangerment from maturing into concrete harm. Cf.\nid. (\u201c[R]equiring EPA to wait until it can conclusively\ndemonstrate that a particular effect is adverse to health before it\nacts is inconsistent with both the [CAA]\u2019s precautionary and\npreventive orientation and the nature of the Administrator's\nstatutory responsibilities. Congress provided that the\nAdministrator is to use his judgment in setting air quality\nstandards precisely to permit him to act in the face of\nuncertainty.\u201d).\n\f                                32\n\n     In Massachusetts v. EPA the Supreme Court confirmed that\nEPA may make an endangerment finding despite lingering\nscientific uncertainty. Indeed, the Court held that the existence\nof \u201csome residual uncertainty\u201d did not excuse EPA\u2019s decision to\ndecline to regulate greenhouse gases. Massachusetts v. EPA, 549\nU.S. at 534. To avoid regulating emissions of greenhouse gases,\nEPA would need to show \u201cscientific uncertainty . . . so profound\nthat it precludes EPA from making a reasoned judgment as to\nwhether greenhouse gases contribute to global warming.\u201d Id.\nClearly, then, EPA may issue an endangerment finding even\nwhile the scientific record still contains at least \u201csome residual\nuncertainty.\u201d Industry Petitioners have shown no more than that.\n\n    In the end, Petitioners are asking us to re-weigh the\nscientific evidence before EPA and reach our own conclusion.\nThis is not our role. As with other reviews of administrative\nproceedings, we do not determine the convincing force of\nevidence, nor the conclusion it should support, but only whether\nthe conclusion reached by EPA is supported by substantial\nevidence when considered on the record as a whole. See, e.g.,\nNew York v. EPA, 413 F.3d 3, 30 (D.C. Cir. 2005). When EPA\nevaluates scientific evidence in its bailiwick, we ask only that it\ntake the scientific record into account \u201cin a rational manner.\u201d\nAm. Petroleum Inst. v. Costle, 665 F.2d 1176, 1187 (D.C. Cir.\n1981). Industry Petitioners have not shown that EPA failed to do\nso here.\n\n                                C.\n\n     State Petitioners, here led by Texas, contend that the\nEndangerment Finding is arbitrary and capricious because EPA\ndid not \u201cdefine,\u201d \u201cmeasure,\u201d or \u201cquantify\u201d either the\natmospheric concentration at which greenhouse gases endanger\npublic health or welfare, the rate or type of climate change that\nit anticipates will endanger public health or welfare, or the risks\n\f                                33\n\nor impacts of climate change. According to Texas, without\ndefining these thresholds and distinguishing \u201csafe\u201d climate\nchange from climate change that endangers, EPA\u2019s\nEndangerment Finding is just a \u201csubjective conviction.\u201d\n\n     It is true that EPA did not provide a quantitative threshold\nat which greenhouse gases or climate change will endanger or\ncause certain impacts to public health or welfare. The text of\nCAA \u00a7 202(a)(1) does not require that EPA set a precise\nnumerical value as part of an endangerment finding. Quite the\nopposite; the \u00a7 202(a)(1) inquiry necessarily entails a case-by-\ncase, sliding-scale approach to endangerment because \u201c[d]anger\n. . . is not set by a fixed probability of harm, but rather is\ncomposed of reciprocal elements of risk and harm, or probability\nand severity.\u201d Ethyl, 541 F.2d at 18. EPA need not establish a\nminimum threshold of risk or harm before determining whether\nan air pollutant endangers. It may base an endangerment finding\non \u201ca lesser risk of greater harm . . . or a greater risk of lesser\nharm\u201d or any combination in between. Id.\n\n     Ethyl is instructive. There, EPA made an endangerment\nfinding for airborne lead. During its endangerment inquiry, EPA\ninitially tried to do what Texas asks of it here: find a specific\nconcentration of the air pollutant below which it would be\nconsidered \u201csafe\u201d and above which it would endanger public\nhealth. Id. at 56. However, EPA abandoned that approach\nbecause it failed to account for \u201cthe wide variability of dietary\nlead intake\u201d and lacked predictive value. EPA substituted a\n\u201cmore qualitative\u201d approach, which relied on \u201cpredictions based\non uncertain data\u201d along with clinical studies. Id. at 56\u201357. This\ncourt upheld the endangerment finding that used that qualitative\napproach despite the lack of a specific endangerment\n\u201cthreshold.\u201d\n\n    In its essence, Texas\u2019s call for quantification of the\n\f                               34\n\nendangerment is no more than a specialized version of Industry\nPetitioners\u2019 claim that the scientific record contains too much\nuncertainty to find endangerment. EPA relied on a substantial\nrecord of empirical data and scientific evidence, making many\nspecific and often quantitative findings regarding the impacts of\ngreenhouse gases on climate change and the effects of climate\nchange on public health and welfare. Its failure to distill this\nocean of evidence into a specific number at which greenhouse\ngases cause \u201cdangerous\u201d climate change is a function of the\nprecautionary thrust of the CAA and the multivariate and\nsometimes uncertain nature of climate science, not a sign of\narbitrary or capricious decision-making.\n\n                               D.\n\n      EPA defined both the \u201cair pollution\u201d and the \u201cair pollutant\u201d\nthat are the subject of the Endangerment Finding as an aggregate\nof six greenhouse gases, which EPA called \u201cwell mixed\ngreenhouse gases\u201d: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4),\nnitrous oxide (N 2 O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs),\nperfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6). Industry\nPetitioners argue that EPA\u2019s decision to include PFCs and SF6\nin this group of greenhouse gases was arbitrary and capricious\nprimarily because motor vehicles generally do not emit these\ntwo gases.\n\n      No petitioner for review of the Endangerment Finding has\nestablished standing to make this argument. Industry Petitioners\nconcede that EPA\u2019s decision to regulate PFCs and SF6 along\nwith the other four greenhouse gases does not injure any motor-\nvehicle-related petitioner. Nor has any non-motor-vehicle-\nrelated petitioner shown an injury-in-fact resulting from EPA\u2019s\ninclusion of these two gases in the six-gas amalgam of \u201cwell-\nmixed greenhouse gases.\u201d At oral argument, Industry Petitioners\nasserted for the first time that certain utility\n\f                              35\n\ncompanies\u2014members of associations that petitioned for review\nof the Endangerment Finding\u2014own utility transformers that\nemit SF6. However, they never demonstrated or even\ndefinitively asserted that any of these companies would not be\nsubject to regulation or permitting requirements but for EPA\u2019s\ndecision to include SF6 as part of the \u201cwell-mixed greenhouse\ngases\u201d that are the subject of the Endangerment Finding. See\nSierra Club v. EPA, 292 F.3d 895, 898\u2013900 (D.C. Cir. 2002)\n(requiring that a petitioner seeking review of agency action\ndemonstrate standing by affidavit or other evidence if standing\nis not \u201cself-evident\u201d from the administrative record). Absent a\npetitioner with standing to challenge EPA\u2019s inclusion of PFCs\nand SF6 in the \u201cair pollution\u201d at issue, this court lacks\njurisdiction to address the merits of Industry Petitioners\u2019\ncontention.\n\n                              E.\n\n      EPA did not submit the Endangerment Finding for review\nby its Science Advisory Board (SAB). Industry Petitioners claim\nthat EPA\u2019s failure to do so violates its mandate to \u201cmake\navailable\u201d to the SAB \u201cany proposed criteria document,\nstandard, limitation, or regulation under the Clean Air Act\u201d at\nthe time it provides the same \u201cto any other Federal agency for\nformal review and comment.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4365(c)(1); see Am.\nPetroleum Inst., 665 F.2d at 1188.\n\n     To begin with, it is not clear that EPA provided the\nEndangerment Finding \u201cto any other Federal agency for formal\nreview and comment,\u201d which triggers this duty to submit a\nregulation to the SAB. EPA only submitted a draft of the\nEndangerment Finding to the Office of Information and\nRegulatory Affairs pursuant to Executive Order 12,866. EPA\ncontends that this was merely an informal review process, not\n\u201cformal review and comment\u201d\u2014at least when compared with a\n\f                                 36\n\nstatutory review-and-comment requirement in which other\nagencies are given the opportunity to provide written comments\nabout the impacts of a proposed regulation on the reviewing\nagency\u2019s universe of responsibility. See, e.g., 49 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 32902(j). Industry Petitioners failed to respond to this\ncontention.\n\n      In any event, even if EPA violated its mandate by failing to\nsubmit the Endangerment Finding to the SAB, Industry\nPetitioners have not shown that this error was \u201cof such central\nrelevance to the rule that there is a substantial likelihood that the\nrule would have been significantly changed if such errors had\nnot been made.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(d)(8); see Am. Petroleum\nInst., 665 F.2d at 1188\u201389 (applying this standard to EPA\u2019s\nfailure to submit an ozone standard to the SAB).\n\n\n\n\n                                 F.\n\n     Lastly, State Petitioners maintain that EPA erred by\ndenying all ten petitions for reconsideration of the\nEndangerment Finding. Those petitions asserted that internal e-\nmails and documents released from the University of East\nAnglia\u2019s Climate Research Unit (CRU)\u2014a contributor to one of\nthe global temperature records and to the IPCC\u2019s assessment\nreport\u2014undermined the scientific evidence supporting the\nEndangerment Finding by calling into question whether the\nIPCC scientists adhered to \u201cbest science practices.\u201d EPA\u2019s\nDenial of the Petitions To Reconsider the Endangerment and\nCause or Contribute Findings for Greenhouse Gases Under\nSection 202(a) of the Clean Air Act (\u201cReconsideration Denial\u201d),\n75 Fed. Reg. 49,556, 49,556\u201357 (Aug. 13, 2010). The petitions\npointed to factual mistakes in the IPCC\u2019s assessment report\n\f                               37\n\nresulting from the use of non-peer-reviewed studies and several\nscientific studies postdating the Endangerment Finding as\nevidence that the Endangerment Finding was flawed. Id.\n\n      On August 13, 2010, EPA issued a denial of the petitions\nfor reconsideration accompanied by a 360-page response to\npetitions (RTP). Id. at 49,556. It determined that the petitions\ndid not provide substantial support for the argument that the\nEndangerment Finding should be revised. According to EPA,\nthe petitioners\u2019 claims based on the CRU documents were\nexaggerated, contradicted by other evidence, and not a material\nor reliable basis for questioning the credibility of the body of\nscience at issue; two of the factual inaccuracies alleged in the\npetitions were in fact mistakes, but both were \u201ctangential and\nminor\u201d and did not change the key IPCC conclusions; and the\nnew scientific studies raised by some petitions were either\nalready considered by EPA, misinterpreted or misrepresented by\npetitioners, or put forth without acknowledging other new\nstudies. Id. at 49,557\u201358.\n\n                                1.\n\n     EPA is required to convene a proceeding for\nreconsideration of a rule if a party raising an objection to the\nrule\n\n         can demonstrate to the Administrator that it was\n         impracticable to raise such objection within such time\n         or if the grounds for such objection arose after the\n         period for public comment (but within the time\n         specified for judicial review) and if such objection is of\n         central relevance to the outcome of the rule.\n\n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(d)(7)(B). For the purpose of determining\nwhether to commence reconsideration of a rule, EPA considers\n\f                                38\n\nan objection to be of \u201ccentral relevance to the outcome\u201d of that\nrule \u201cif it provides substantial support for the argument that the\nregulation should be revised.\u201d Reconsideration Denial, 75 Fed.\nReg. at 49,561.\n\n      State Petitioners have not provided substantial support for\ntheir argument that the Endangerment Finding should be\nrevised. State Petitioners point out that some studies the IPCC\nreferenced in its assessment were not peer-reviewed, but they\nignore the fact that (1) the IPCC assessment relied on around\n18,000 studies that were peer-reviewed, and (2) the IPCC\u2019s\nreport development procedures expressly permitted the inclusion\nin the assessment of some non-peer-reviewed studies (\u201cgray\u201d\nliterature).\n\n      Moreover, as EPA determined, the limited inaccurate\ninformation developed from the gray literature does not appear\nsufficient to undermine the substantial overall evidentiary\nsupport for the Endangerment Finding. State Petitioners have\nnot, as they assert, uncovered a \u201cpattern\u201d of flawed science.\nOnly two of the errors they point out seem to be errors at all, and\nEPA relied on neither in making the Endangerment Finding.\nFirst, as State Petitioners assert, the IPCC misstated the\npercentage of the Netherlands that is below sea level, a statistic\nthat was used for background information. However, the IPCC\ncorrected the error, and EPA concluded that the error was\n\u201cminor and had no impact,\u201d and the Endangerment Finding did\nnot refer to the statistic in any way. Id. at 49,576\u201377. Second,\nthe IPCC acknowledged misstating the rate at which Himalayan\nglaciers are receding. EPA also did not rely on that projection in\nthe Endangerment Finding. Id. at 49,577.\n\n     State Petitioners also contend that a new study contradicts\nEPA\u2019s reliance on a projection of more violent storms in the\nfuture as a result of climate change, but the study they cite only\n\f                               39\n\nconcerns past trends, not projected future storms. The record\nshows that EPA considered the new studies on storm trends and\nconcluded that the studies were consistent with the\nEndangerment Finding. In sum, State Petitioners have failed to\nshow that these isolated \u201cerrors\u201d provide substantial support for\ntheir argument to overturn the Endangerment Finding.\n\n                               2.\n\n      State Petitioners\u2019 further argument that EPA erred in\ndenying reconsideration fails as well. These Petitioners claim\nEPA erred by failing to provide notice and comment before\ndenying the petitions for reconsideration because EPA\u2019s\ninclusion of a 360-page RTP amounted to a revision of the\nEndangerment Finding, and revision of a rule requires notice\nand comment. The RTP, however, appears to be exactly what\nEPA called it\u2014a response to the petitions for reconsideration,\nnot a revision of the Endangerment Finding itself. EPA certainly\nmay deny petitions for reconsideration of a rule and provide an\nexplanation for that denial, including by providing support for\nthat decision, without triggering a new round of notice and\ncomment for the rule.\n\n                              III.\n\n      State and Industry Petitioners contend that in promulgating\nthe Tailpipe Rule, EPA relied on an improper interpretation of\nCAA \u00a7 202(a)(1), and was arbitrary and capricious in failing to\njustify and consider the cost impacts of its conclusion that the\nRule triggers stationary-source regulation under the PSD and\nTitle V provisions. They do not challenge the substantive\nstandards of the Rule and focus principally on EPA\u2019s failure to\nconsider the cost of stationary-source permitting requirements\ntriggered by the Rule. Positing an absurd-consequences\nscenario, Petitioners maintain that if EPA had considered these\n\f                               40\n\ncosts it \u201cwould have been forced\u201d to exclude carbon dioxide\nfrom the scope of the emission standards, to decline to issue\ngreenhouse gas emission standards at all, or \u201cto interpret the\nstatute so as not to automatically trigger stationary source\nregulation.\u201d Industry Tailpipe Br. 17; see also Industry Tailpipe\nReply Br. 8\u20139. Both the plain text of Section 202(a) and\nprecedent refute Petitioners\u2019 contentions.\n\n                               A.\n\n     Section 202(a)(1) provides:\n\n         The Administrator shall by regulation prescribe . . .\n         standards applicable to the emission of any air\n         pollutant from any class or classes of new motor\n         vehicles or new motor vehicle engines, which in his\n         judgment cause, or contribute to, air pollution which\n         may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public\n         health or welfare.\n\n 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7521(a)(1). By employing the verb \u201cshall,\u201d\nCongress vested a non-discretionary duty in EPA. See Sierra\nClub v. Jackson, 648 F.3d 848, 856 (D.C. Cir. 2011). The plain\ntext of Section 202(a)(1) thus refutes Industry Petitioners\u2019\ncontention that EPA had discretion to defer issuance of motor-\nvehicle emission standards on the basis of stationary-source\ncosts. Neither the adjacent text nor the statutory context\notherwise condition this clear \u201clanguage of command,\u201d id.\n(citation omitted). Having made the Endangerment Finding\npursuant to CAA \u00a7 202(a), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7521(a), EPA lacked\ndiscretion to defer promulgation of the Tailpipe Rule on the\nbasis of its trigger of stationary-source permitting requirements\nunder the PSD program and Title V.\n\n     The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Massachusetts v. EPA\n\f                               41\n\ncompels this interpretation of Section 202(a)(1). \u201cIf EPA makes\na finding of endangerment, the Clean Air Act requires the\n[a]gency to regulate emissions of the deleterious pollutant from\nnew motor vehicles.\u201d 549 U.S. at 533. \u201cUnder the clear terms\nof the Clean Air Act, EPA can avoid taking further action only\nif it determines that greenhouse gases do not contribute to\nclimate change or if it provides some reasonable explanation as\nto why it cannot or will not exercise its discretion to determine\nwhether they do.\u201d Id. (emphasis added). In the Endangerment\nFinding, EPA determined that motor-vehicle emissions\ncontribute to greenhouse gas emissions that, in turn, endanger\nthe public health and welfare; the agency therefore was in no\nposition to \u201cavoid taking further action,\u201d id., by deferring\npromulgation of the Tailpipe Rule. Given the non-discretionary\nduty in Section 202(a)(1) and the limited flexibility available\nunder Section 202(a)(2), which this court has held relates only\nto the motor-vehicle industry, see infra Part III.C, EPA had no\nstatutory basis on which it could \u201cground [any] reasons for\u201d\nfurther inaction, Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. at 535.\n\n      The plain text of Section 202(a)(1) also negates Industry\nPetitioners\u2019 contention that EPA had discretion to defer the\nTailpipe Rule on the basis of NHTSA\u2019s authority to regulate fuel\neconomy. The Supreme Court dismissed a near-identical\nargument in Massachusetts v. EPA, rejecting the suggestion that\nEPA could decline to regulate carbon-dioxide emissions because\nthe Department of Transportation (DOT) had independent\nauthority to set fuel-efficiency standards. Id. at 531\u201332. \u201c[T]hat\nDOT sets mileage standards in no way licenses EPA to shirk its\nenvironmental responsibilities,\u201d because EPA\u2019s duty to\npromulgate emission standards derives from \u201ca statutory\nobligation wholly independent of DOT\u2019s mandate to promote\nenergy efficiency.\u201d Id. at 532. Just as EPA lacks authority to\nrefuse to regulate on the grounds of NHTSA\u2019s regulatory\nauthority, EPA cannot defer regulation on that basis. A\n\f                                42\n\ncomparison of the relevant statutes bolsters this conclusion.\nCompare 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 32902(f) (\u201cWhen deciding maximum\nfeasible average fuel economy . . . , the Secretary of\nTransportation shall consider . . . the effect of other motor\nvehicle standards of the Government on fuel economy . . . .\u201d),\nwith 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7521(a) (including no such direction). Nor,\napplying the same reasoning, was EPA required to treat\nNHTSA\u2019s proposed regulations as establishing the baseline for\nthe Tailpipe Rule. Furthermore, the Tailpipe Rule provides\nbenefits above and beyond those resulting from NHTSA\u2019s fuel-\neconomy standards. See, e.g., Tailpipe Rule, 75 Fed. Reg. at\n25,490 (Table III.F.1-2), 25,636 (Table IV.G.1-4). Petitioners\u2019\nrelated contentions regarding the PSD permitting triggers are\naddressed in Part V.\n\n                                B.\n\n      Turning to the APA, Industry Petitioners contend, relying\non Small Refiner Lead Phase-Down Task Force v. EPA, 705\nF.2d 506, 525 (D.C. Cir. 1983), and Ethyl Corp. v. EPA, 541\nF.2d 1 (D.C. Cir. 1976), that EPA failed both to justify the\nTailpipe Rule in terms of the risk identified in the Endangerment\nFinding and to show that the proposed standards \u201cwould\nmeaningfully mitigate the alleged endangerment,\u201d Industry\nTailpipe Br. 35. Instead, they maintain that EPA \u201cseparated\nthese two integral steps,\u201d id. at 11, and \u201cconcluded that it had no\nobligation to show . . . \u2018the resulting emissions control strategy\nor strategies will have some significant degree of harm reduction\nor effectiveness in addressing the endangerment,\u2019\u201d id. at 11\u201312\n(quoting Endangerment Finding, 74 Fed. Reg. at 66,508). These\ncontentions fail.\n\n\n    Petitioners\u2019 reliance on Small Refiner, 705 F.2d at 525, is\nmisplaced; the court there laid out guidelines for assessing\n\f                               43\n\nEPA\u2019s discretion to set numerical standards and Petitioners do\nnot challenge the substance of the emission standards. In Ethyl,\n541 F.2d at 7, the court assessed the scope of EPA\u2019s authority,\nunder CAA \u00a7 211(c)(1), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857f-6c(c)(1) (1970)\n(currently codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7545(c)(1)), to\nregulate lead particulate in motor-vehicle emissions. The court\nrejected the argument that the regulations had to \u201cbe premised\nupon factual proof of actual harm,\u201d Ethyl, 541 F.2d at 12, and\ninstead deferred to EPA\u2019s reasonable interpretation that\nregulations could be based on a \u201csignificant risk of harm,\u201d id. at\n13. Nothing in Ethyl implied that EPA\u2019s authority to regulate\nwas conditioned on evidence of a particular level of mitigation;\nonly a showing of significant contribution was required. EPA\nmade such a determination in the Endangerment Finding,\nconcluding that vehicle emissions are a significant contributor\nto domestic greenhouse gas emissions. See, e.g., Endangerment\nFinding, 74 Fed. Reg. at 66,499. Further, in the preamble to the\nTailpipe Rule itself, EPA found that the emission standards\nwould result in meaningful mitigation of greenhouse gas\nemissions. For example, EPA estimated that the Rule would\nresult in a reduction of about 960 million metric tons of CO2e\nemissions over the lifetime of the model year 2012\u20132016\nvehicles affected by the new standards. See Tailpipe Rule, 75\nFed. Reg. at 25,488\u201390. Other precedent is likewise unhelpful\nto Petitioners: in Chemical Manufacturers Association v. EPA,\n217 F.3d 861, 866 (D.C. Cir. 2000), \u201cnothing in the record\u201d\nindicated that the challenged regulatory program would \u201cdirectly\nor indirectly, further the Clean Air Act\u2019s environmental goals,\u201d\nwhereas here the record is fulsome, see supra Part II.\n\n                               C.\n\n      Petitioners also invoke Section 202(a)(2) as support for\ntheir contention that EPA must consider stationary-source costs\nin the Tailpipe Rule. Section 202(a)(2) provides:\n\f                                44\n\n         Any regulation prescribed under paragraph (1) of this\n         subsection . . . shall take effect after such period as the\n         Administrator finds necessary to permit the\n         development and application of the requisite\n         technology, giving appropriate consideration to the\n         cost of compliance within such period.\n\n 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7521(a)(2). State Petitioners maintain the reference\nto compliance costs encompasses those experienced by\nstationary sources under the PSD program, while Industry\nPetitioners maintain stationary-source costs are a relevant factor\nin EPA\u2019s Section 202(a)(1) rulemaking. This court, however,\nhas held that the Section 202(a)(2) reference to compliance costs\nencompasses only the cost to the motor-vehicle industry to come\ninto compliance with the new emission standards, and does not\nmandate consideration of costs to other entities not directly\nsubject to the proposed standards. See Motor & Equip. Mfrs.\nAss\u2019n, Inc. v. EPA, 627 F.2d 1095, 1118 (D.C. Cir. 1979).\n\n                                D.\n\n     Petitioners\u2019 remaining challenges to the Tailpipe Rule fail\nas well. In Part II, the court rejects the contention that the\nTailpipe Rule fails due to flaws in the underlying Endangerment\nFinding. The record also refutes Industry Petitioners\u2019 suggestion\nthat EPA \u201cemployed a shell game to avoid,\u201d Industry Tailpipe\nReply Br. 9 (capitalization removed), responding to comments\nregarding stationary-source costs. Industry Tailpipe Br. 19\u201320;\nsee also Industry Tailpipe Reply Br. 14\u201315. EPA adequately\nresponded to \u201csignificant comments,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\n7607(d)(6)(B). See, e.g., Tailpipe Rule, 75 Fed. Reg. at\n25,401\u201302; Tailpipe Rule, Response to Comments at 7-65 to 7-\n69. And, assuming other statutory mandates provide a basis for\njudicial review, see Industry Tailpipe Br. 21\u201322 (listing\nmandates); see, e.g., Small Refiner, 705 F.2d at 537\u201339, the\n\f                               45\n\nrecord shows EPA\u2019s compliance, see Tailpipe Rule, 75 Fed.\nReg. at 25,539\u201342, and that EPA was not arbitrary and\ncapricious by not considering stationary-source costs in its\nanalyses. See, e.g., Michigan v. EPA, 213 F.3d 663, 689 (D.C.\nCir. 2000); Mid-Tex Elec. Coop., Inc. v. FERC, 773 F.2d 327,\n341\u201342 (D.C. Cir. 1985). EPA\u2019s economic impact assessment\nconducted pursuant to CAA \u00a7 317, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7617, does not\nprovide grounds for granting the petitions because Petitioners\u2019\ncontentions that EPA, \u201c[i]n defiance of these requirements, . . .\nrefused to estimate or even consider the costs of the [Tailpipe\nRule] for stationary sources,\u201d Industry Tailpipe Br. 22, are no\nmore than another attempt to avoid the plain text of Section\n202(a). See also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7617(e).\n\n                              IV.\n\n     We turn next to the stationary source regulations. As noted\nsupra in Part I, EPA\u2019s interpretation of the CAA requires PSD\nand Title V permits for stationary sources whose potential\nemissions exceed statutory thresholds for any regulated\npollutant\u2014including greenhouse gases. Industry Petitioners now\nchallenge EPA\u2019s longstanding interpretation of the scope of the\npermitting requirements for construction and modification of\nmajor emitting facilities under CAA Sections 165(a) and 169(1),\n42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7475(a) & 7479(1) (\u201cthe PSD permitting\ntriggers\u201d). EPA maintains that this challenge is untimely\nbecause its interpretation of the PSD permitting triggers was set\nforth in its 1978, 1980, and 2002 Rules.\n\n     In 1978, EPA defined \u201cmajor stationary source\u201d as a source\nthat emits major amounts of \u201cany air pollutant regulated under\nthe [CAA].\u201d Part 51\u2013Requirements for Preparation, Adoption,\nand Submittal of Implementation Plans; Prevention of\nSignificant Air Quality Deterioration (\u201c1978 Implementation\nPlan Requirements\u201d), 43 Fed. Reg. 26,380, 26,382 (June 19,\n\f                               46\n\n1978). Industry petitioners\u2019 challenge to the 1978 Rule in\nAlabama Power Co. v. Costle, 636 F.2d 323 (D.C. Cir. 1980)\nreflected their understanding that EPA would apply the PSD\npermitting program to both pollutants regulated pursuant to\nNational Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and other\nregulated pollutants. See Br. for Industry Pet\u2019rs on Regulation of\nPollutants other than Sulfur Dioxide and Particulates, No. 78-\n1006 (and consolidated cases) (Dec. 19, 1978) at 10, 12. In the\n1980 Rule, EPA highlighted that to be subject to PSD review, a\n\u201csource need only emit any pollutant in major amounts (i.e., the\namounts specified in [CAA \u00a7 169(1)]) and be located in an area\ndesignated attainment or unclassifiable for that or any other\npollutant.\u201d 1980 Implementation Plan Requirements, 45 Fed.\nReg. at 52,711 (emphasis in original). EPA explained that \u201cany\npollutant\u201d meant \u201cboth criteria pollutants, for which national\nambient air quality standards have been promulgated, and non-\ncriteria pollutants subject to regulation under the Act.\u201d Id. The\nsame explanation of EPA\u2019s interpretation appeared in the 2002\nRule. Prevention of Significant Deterioration and\nNonattainment New Source Review, 67 Fed. Reg. 80,186,\n80,239-40, 80,264 (Dec. 31, 2002).\n\n     CAA Section 307(b)(1) provides that a petition for review\nof any promulgated nationally applicable regulations:\n\n      \u201cshall be filed within sixty days from the date notice of\n     such promulgation . . . appears in the Federal Register,\n     except that if such petition is based solely on grounds\n     arising after such sixtieth day, then any petition for review\n     . . . shall be filed within sixty days after such grounds\n     arise.\u201d\n\n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). The exception encompasses the\noccurrence of an event that ripens a claim. See Chamber of\nCommerce v. EPA, 642 F.3d 192, 208 n.14 (D.C. Cir. 2011);\n\f                              47\n\nAm. Rd. & Transp. Builders Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 588 F.3d 1109, 1113\n(D.C. Cir. 2009). EPA acknowledges this precedent, but\nmaintains that the \u201cnew grounds\u201d exception is narrow and\ninapplicable because Industry Petitioners\u2019 challenge to EPA\u2019s\ninterpretation of the PSD permitting triggers is based on legal\narguments that were available during the normal judicial review\nperiods for the 1978, 1980, and 2002 Rules, and the \u201cnew\nground\u201d on which they now rely is a factual development,\nnamely the regulation of greenhouse gases by the Tailpipe Rule.\nThis is correct so far as it goes, but fails to demonstrate that\nIndustry Petitioners\u2019 challenge is untimely.\n\n    Industry Petitioners point out that two petitioners\u2014the\nNational Association of Home Builders ( NAHB ) and National\nOilseed Processors Association ( NOPA ) \u2013 have newly ripened\nclaims as a result of the Tailpipe Rule, which had the effect of\nexpanding the PSD program to never-regulated sources:\n\n    \u2022 NAHB\u2019s members construct single family homes,\n    apartment buildings, and commercial buildings. According\n    to the Vice President of Legal Affairs, prior to the Tailpipe\n    Rule, no member of NAHB was a major source of any\n    regulated pollutant, and thus no member was ever required\n    to obtain a PSD permit. Decl. of Thomas J. Ward, Vice\n    President of Legal Affairs for NAHB, \u00b6 6 (May 10, 2011).\n    Since the Tailpipe Rule rendered greenhouse gases a\n    regulated pollutant, it is now certain that NAHB members\n    that engage in construction projects that emit greenhouse\n    gases in major amounts will have to obtain PSD permits\n    sometime in the future. Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 7, 8. Indeed, EPA\n    estimated that 6,397 multifamily buildings and 515 single\n    family homes would trigger PSD review annually absent\n    the Tailoring Rule. See Prevention of Significant\n    Deterioration and Title V Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule;\n    Proposed Rule (\u201cProposed Tailoring Rule\u201d), 74 Fed. Reg.\n\f                               48\n\n    55,292, 55,338 (Oct. 27, 2009).\n\n    \u2022 NOPA\u2019s members are large companies that monthly\n    produce millions of tons of vegetable meals and over a\n    billion pounds of oils from oilseeds, such as soybeans. See,\n    e.g., NOPA, January 2012 Statistical Report (Feb. 14, 2012)\n    available at www.nopa.org; NOPA, February 2012\n    Statistical Report (Mar. 14, 2012), available at\n    www.nopa.org. According to the Executive Vice President\n    of Regulatory Affairs, NOPA members operate facilities\n    that are major sources of criteria pollutants and, for this\n    reason, are subject to PSD review. Decl. of David C. Ailor,\n    Executive Vice President of Regulatory Affairs of NOPA,\n    \u00b6 8 (May 10, 2011). Prior to promulgation of the Tailpipe\n    Rule, no member\u2019s facility had triggered PSD review by\n    virtue of emissions of a non-criteria pollutant. Id. Now that\n    greenhouse gases are a regulated non-criteria pollutant,\n    many NOPA members will have to obtain PSD permits as\n    result of their facilities\u2019 emissions of a non-criteria\n    pollutant. Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 9,10. For some NOPA members this time\n    is not far off because renovations to their facilities will\n    result in greenhouse gas emissions above the significance\n    thresholds set by the Tailoring Rule, 75 Fed. Reg. at 31,567.\n    Id. at \u00b6 9.\n\nIndustry Petitioners thus maintain that because NAHB and\nNOPA filed their petitions on July 6, 2010, within 60 days of the\npromulgation of the Tailpipe Rule in the Federal Register on\nMay 7, 2010, their challenges are timely.\n\n     \u201cRipeness, while often spoken of as a justiciability doctrine\ndistinct from standing, in fact shares the constitutional\nrequirement of standing that an injury in fact be certainly\nimpending.\u201d Nat\u2019l Treasury Emp. Union v. United States, 101\nF.3d 1423, 1427 (D.C. Cir. 1996). During an initial review\n\f                               49\n\nperiod, although purely legal claims may be justiciable and,\nthus, prudentially ripe, a party without an immediate or\nthreatened injury lacks a constitutionally ripe claim. See\nBaltimore Gas & Elec. Co. v. ICC, 672 F.2d 146, 149 (D.C. Cir.\n1982). EPA\u2019s position would conflate the constitutional and\nprudential considerations. Constitutional ripeness exists where\na challenge \u201cinvolve[s], at least in part, the existence of a live\n\u2018Case or Controversy.\u2019\u201d Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Envtl.\nStudy Group, 438 U.S. 59, 81 (1978). Prudential considerations\nembodied in the ripeness doctrine relate to \u201cthe fitness of the\nissues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of\nwithholding court consideration.\u201d Abbott Labs. v. Gardner, 387\nU.S. 136, 149 (1967); see Duke Power, 438 U.S. at 81. Standing\nto challenge agency action exists where a petitioner can\ndemonstrate an \u201cinjury in fact\u201d that is fairly traceable to the\nchallenged action and is likely to be redressed by a favorable\njudicial decision. Reytblatt v. NRC, 105 F.3d 715, 721 (D.C. Cir.\n1997) (citing Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555,\n560\u201361 (1992)).\n\n     Had NAHB and NOPA challenged EPA\u2019s interpretation of\nthe PSD permitting triggers in 1978, 1980, or 2002, as EPA\nsuggests, the court would have lacked jurisdiction under Article\nIII of the Constitution because their alleged injuries were only\nspeculative. See, e.g., Occidental Permian Ltd. v. FERC, 673\nF.3d 1024, 1026 (D.C. Cir. 2012); Baltimore Gas & Elec. Co.,\n672 F.2d at 149. At that time, NAHB and NOPA could have\nshown only the possibility that their members would be injured\nif EPA were someday to determine that greenhouse gases were\na pollutant that endangers human health and welfare and to\nadopt a rule regulating the greenhouse gas emissions of\nstationary sources. EPA does not challenge the assertions in the\nNAHB and NOPA declarations, which establish no such rule\nwas promulgated prior to the Tailpipe Rule.\n\f                                50\n\n     The NAHB and NOPA challenges ceased to be speculative\nwhen EPA promulgated the Tailpipe Rule regulating greenhouse\ngases and their challenges ripened because of the \u201csubstantial\nprobability\u201d of injury to them. See Baltimore Gas & Elec. Co.,\n672 F.2d at 149. Although, as EPA notes, other Industry\nPetitioners\u2019 challenges to EPA\u2019s interpretation of the PSD\npermitting triggers ripened decades earlier, this court has\nassured petitioners with unripe claims that \u201cthey will not be\nforeclosed from judicial review when the appropriate time\ncomes,\u201d Grand Canyon Air Tour Coalition v. FAA, 154 F.3d\n455, 473 (D.C. Cir. 1998), and that they \u201cneed not fear\npreclusion by reason of the 60-day stipulation [barring judicial\nreview],\u201d Baltimore Gas & Elec. Co., 672 F.2d at 149\u201350. EPA\nexpresses concern that allowing NAHB and NOPA to litigate\ntheir newly ripened claims will have far-reaching implications\nfor finality of agency actions, but \u201cthe ripeness doctrine reflects\na judgment that the disadvantages of a premature review that\nmay prove too abstract or unnecessary ordinarily outweigh the\nadditional costs of \u2013 even repetitive \u2013 . . . litigation.\u201d Ohio\nForestry Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Sierra Club, 523 U.S. 726, 735 (1998).\nSome limitations inhere in doctrines such as stare decisis or the\nlaw-of-the-circuit doctrine, see LaShawn A. v. Barry, 87 F.3d\n1389, 1395 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (en banc).\n\n     Because petitioners NAHB and NOPA\u2019s challenges to\nEPA\u2019s PSD permitting triggers are newly ripened upon\npromulgation of the Tailpipe Rule and they filed petitions for\nreview within sixty days thereof, their challenge to EPA\u2019s\ninterpretation of the PSD permitting triggers is timely.\n\n                                V.\n\n     Having established that Industry Petitioners\u2019 challenges to\nthe PSD permitting triggers are both timely and ripe, we turn to\nthe merits of their claims.\n\f                                 51\n\n                                 A.\n\n     CAA Title I, Part C\u2014entitled \u201cPrevention of Significant\nDeterioration of Air Quality\u201d (PSD)\u2014largely focuses on the\nmaintenance of national ambient air quality standards\n(NAAQS). Under the PSD program, EPA designates specific\npollutants as \u201cNAAQS pollutants\u201d and sets national ambient air\nquality standards for those pollutants\u2014requiring, for example,\nthat the concentration of a given NAAQS pollutant may not\nexceed more than a certain number of parts per billion in the\nambient air. See generally 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7407. Thus far, EPA has\ndesignated six NAAQS pollutants: carbon monoxide, lead,\nnitrogen dioxide, ozone, particle pollution, and sulfur dioxide.\nNone of these NAAQS pollutants is one of the six well-mixed\ngreenhouse gases defined as an \u201cair pollutant\u201d in the\nEndangerment Finding. See Environmental Protection Agency,\nNational Ambient Air Quality Standards, available at\nhttp://www.epa.gov/air/criteria.html (last visited May 3, 2012);\nEndangerment Finding, 74 Fed. Reg. 66,536-37.\n\n     Acting upon information submitted by states, EPA then\ndetermines whether each region of the country is in \u201cattainment\u201d\nor \u201cnonattainment\u201d with the promulgated air quality standard for\neach NAAQS pollutant, or, alternatively, whether a region is\n\u201cunclassifiable\u201d for that pollutant. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7407(d)(1)(A).\nAn area in attainment for a NAAQS pollutant is \u201cany area . . .\nthat meets the . . . ambient air quality standard for the pollutant.\u201d\nId. \u00a7 7407(d)(1)(A)(ii). By contrast, an area in nonattainment for\na NAAQS pollutant is \u201cany area that does not meet (or that\ncontributes to ambient air quality in a nearby area that does not\nmeet) the national . . . ambient air quality standard for the\npollutant.\u201d Id. \u00a7 7407(d)(1)(A)(i). Finally, an unclassifiable area\nis any area that \u201ccannot be classified on the basis of available\ninformation as meeting or not meeting the . . . ambient air\nquality standard for the pollutant.\u201d Id. \u00a7 7407(d)(1)(A)(iii).\n\f                                52\n\n      The PSD program applies to those areas of the United States\ndesignated as in \u201cattainment\u201d or \u201cunclassifiable\u201d for any\nNAAQS pollutant, see id. \u00a7 7471, and requires permits for major\nemitting facilities embarking on construction or modification\nprojects in those regions. Id. \u00a7 7475(a). A separate part of Title\nI of the CAA, Part D, governs the construction and modification\nof sources in nonattainment regions. See id. \u00a7\u00a7 7501, 7502. It\nbears emphasis that attainment classifications are pollutant-\nspecific: depending on the levels of each NAAQS pollutant in\nan area, a region can be designated as in attainment for NAAQS\npollutant A, but in nonattainment for NAAQS pollutant B. If a\nmajor emitting facility in such a region wishes to undertake a\nconstruction or modification project, both Part C and Part D\u2019s\nsubstantive requirements apply\u2014that is, the source must obtain\na general PSD permit and must also abide by Part D\u2019s more\nstringent, pollutant-specific requirements for any NAAQS\npollutants for which the area is in nonattainment. See 1980\nImplementation Plan Requirements, 45 Fed. Reg. at 52,711-12\n(\u201cwhere a source emits in major amounts a pollutant for which\nthe area in which the source would locate is designated\nnonattainment, Part D NSR rather than Part C PSD review\nshould apply to those pollutants.\u201d) (emphasis added).\n\n    The key substantive provision in the PSD program is CAA\nSection 165(a), which establishes permitting requirements for\n\u201cmajor emitting facilities\u201d located in attainment or unclassifiable\nregions. In relevant part, section 165(a) provides that \u201c[n]o\nmajor emitting facility . . . may be constructed in any area to\nwhich this part applies unless\u201d the facility obtains a PSD permit.\n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7475(a). To obtain a PSD permit, a covered source\nmust, among other things, install the \u201cbest available control\ntechnology [BACT] for each pollutant subject to regulation\nunder [the CAA]\u201d\u2014regardless of whether that pollutant is a\nNAAQS pollutant. Id. \u00a7 7475(a)(4). Since the Tailpipe Rule\nbecame effective, EPA has regulated automotive greenhouse gas\n\f                                53\n\nemissions under Title II of the Act. Thus, greenhouse gases are\nnow a \u201cpollutant subject to regulation under\u201d the Act, and, as\nrequired by the statute itself, any \u201cmajor emitting facility\u201d\ncovered by the PSD program must install BACT for greenhouse\ngases. See id.\n\n\n     The dispute in this case centers largely on the scope of the\nPSD program\u2014specifically, which stationary sources count as\n\u201cmajor emitting facilities\u201d subject to regulation. CAA Section\n169(1) defines \u201cmajor emitting facility,\u201d for the purposes of the\nPSD program, as a stationary source \u201cwhich emit[s], or [has] the\npotential to emit\u201d either 100 tons per year (tpy) or 250 tpy of\n\u201cany air pollutant.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7479(1) (emphasis added). As\ndiscussed supra in Part I, whether the 100 or 250 tpy threshold\napplies depends on the type of source. Certain listed categories\nof sources\u2014for example, iron and steel mill plants\u2014qualify as\n\u201cmajor emitting facilities\u201d if they have the potential to emit over\n100 tons per year of \u201cany air pollutant.\u201d Id. All other stationary\nsources are \u201cmajor emitting facilities\u201d if they have the potential\nto emit over 250 tons per year of \u201cany air pollutant.\u201d Id.\n\n          As mentioned above, since 1978 EPA has interpreted\nthe phrase \u201cany air pollutant\u201d in the definition of \u201cmajor\nemitting facility\u201d as \u201cany air pollutant regulated under the\nCAA.\u201d See 1978 Implementation Plan Requirements, 43 Fed.\nReg. at 26,388, 26,403; supra Part IV. Thus, because the PSD\nprogram covers \u201cmajor emitting facilities\u201d in \u201cany area to which\nthis part applies,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7475, EPA requires PSD permits\nfor stationary sources that 1) are located in an area designated as\nattainment or unclassifiable for any NAAQS pollutant, and 2)\nemit 100/250 tpy of any regulated air pollutant, regardless of\nwhether that pollutant is itself a NAAQS pollutant. See 1980\nImplementation Plan Requirements, 45 Fed. Reg. at 52,710-11.\nConsequently, once the Tailpipe Rule took effect and made\n\f                                54\n\ngreenhouse gases a regulated pollutant under Title II of the Act,\nthe PSD program automatically applied to facilities emitting\nover 100/250 tpy of greenhouse gases. But because immediate\nregulation of greenhouse gas-emitting sources exceeding the\n100/250 tpy benchmark would result in \u201coverwhelming\npermitting burdens that would . . . fall on permitting authorities\nand sources,\u201d Tailoring Rule, 75 Fed. Reg. at 31,516, EPA\u2019s\nTailoring Rule provided that, for now, sources are subject to\nPSD permitting requirements only if they have the potential to\nemit over 100,000 tpy of greenhouse gases (for a construction\nproject) or 75,000 tpy (for a modification project). Id. at 31,523;\nsee also infra, Part VI.\n\n     According to EPA, its longstanding interpretation of the\nphrase \u201cany air pollutant\u201d\u2014\u201cany air pollutant regulated under\nthe CAA\u201d\u2014is compelled by the statute. See id. at 31,517.\nDisputing this point, Industry Petitioners argue that the phrase\nis capable of a far more circumscribed meaning and that EPA\ncould have\u2014and should have\u2014avoided extending the PSD\npermitting program to major greenhouse gas emitters. For the\nreasons discussed below, we agree with EPA that its\nlongstanding interpretation of the PSD permitting trigger is\nstatutorily compelled. Thus, as EPA argues, it \u201cmust give effect\nto the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress,\u201d Chevron,\n467 U.S. at 843, which here requires PSD coverage for major\nemitters of any regulated air pollutant.\n\n     We begin our analysis, as we must, with the statute\u2019s plain\nlanguage. See Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842 (\u201cFirst, always, is the\nquestion whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise\nquestion at issue.\u201d). CAA Section 169(1) requires PSD permits\nfor stationary sources emitting major amounts of \u201cany air\npollutant.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7479(1) (emphasis added). On its face,\n\u201cthe word \u2018any\u2019 has an expansive meaning, that is, \u2018one or some\nindiscriminately of whatever kind,\u2019 \u201d United States v. Gonzales,\n\f                               55\n\n520 U.S. 1, 5 (1997) (quoting WEBSTER\u2019S THIRD NEW\nINTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY 97 (1976)). Greenhouse gases are\nindisputably an \u201cair pollutant.\u201d See Massachusetts v. EPA, 549\nU.S. at 528\u201329. Congress\u2019s use of the broad, indiscriminate\nmodifier \u201cany\u201d thus strongly suggests that the phrase \u201cany air\npollutant\u201d encompasses greenhouse gases.\n\n     This plain-language reading of the statute is buttressed by\nthe Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Massachusetts v. EPA. There\nthe Court determined that CAA\u2019s overarching definition of \u201cair\npollutant\u201d in Section 302(g)\u2014which applies to all provisions of\nthe Act, including the PSD program\u2014unambiguously includes\ngreenhouse gases. Noting that \u201c[t]he Clean Air Act\u2019s sweeping\ndefinition of \u2018air pollutant\u2019 includes \u2018any air pollution agent or\ncombination of such agents . . . . which is emitted into or\notherwise enters the ambient air,\u201d the Court held that \u201cthe\ndefinition embraces all airborne compounds of whatever stripe,\nand underscores that intent through repeated use of the word\n\u2018any.\u2019\u201d Id. at 529 (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7602(g)) (second and\nthird emphases added). Crucially for purposes of the issue\nbefore us, the Court concluded that \u201c[t]he statute is\nunambiguous.\u201d Id.\n\n    Thus, we are faced with a statutory term\u2014\u201cair\npollutant\u201d\u2014that the Supreme Court has determined\nunambiguously encompasses greenhouse gases. This phrase is\npreceded by the expansive term \u201cany,\u201d a word the Court held\n\u201cunderscores\u201d Congress\u2019s intent to include \u201call\u201d air pollutants\n\u201cof whatever stripe.\u201d See id. Absent some compelling reason to\nthink otherwise, \u201c \u2018any\u2019 . . . means any,\u201d Ford v. Mabus, 629\nF.3d 198, 206 (D.C. Cir. 2010), and Petitioners have given us no\nreason to construe that word narrowly here. To the contrary:\ngiven both the statute\u2019s plain language and the Supreme Court\u2019s\ndecision in Massachusetts v. EPA, we have little trouble\nconcluding that the phrase \u201cany air pollutant\u201d includes all\n\f                                56\n\nregulated air pollutants, including greenhouse gases.\n\n          In reaching this conclusion, we recognize that EPA\u2019s\ndefinition of \u201cany air pollutant\u201d slightly narrows the literal\nstatutory definition, which nowhere requires that \u201cany air\npollutant\u201d be a regulated pollutant. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7479(1). But\nthis does not make the statutory language ambiguous. Indeed,\n\u201cany regulated air pollutant\u201d is the only logical reading of the\nstatute. The CAA\u2019s universal definition of \u201cair pollutant\u201d\u2014the\none at issue in Massachusetts v. EPA\u2014provides that the term\nincludes \u201cany physical, chemical, biological [or] radioactive . .\n. substance or matter which is emitted into or otherwise enters\nthe ambient air.\u201d Id. \u00a7 7602(g). Of course, nothing in the CAA\nrequires regulation of a substance simply because it qualifies as\nan \u201cair pollutant\u201d under this broad definition. As discussed\nsupra in Parts II and III, for example, the Act requires EPA to\nprescribe motor vehicle \u201cstandards applicable to the emission of\nany air pollutant\u201d only if that pollutant \u201ccause[s], or\ncontribute[s] to, air pollution which may reasonably be\nanticipated to endanger public health or welfare.\u201d Id.\n\u00a7 7521(a)(1). But if \u201cany air pollutant\u201d in the definition of\n\u201cmajor emitting facility\u201d was read to encompass both regulated\nand nonregulated air pollutants, sources could qualify as major\nemitting facilities\u2014and thus be subjected to PSD permitting\nrequirements\u2014if they emitted 100/250 tpy of a \u201cphysical,\nchemical, [or] biological\u201d substance EPA had determined was\nharmless. It is absurd to think that Congress intended to subject\nstationary sources to the PSD permitting requirements due to\nemissions of substances that do not \u201cendanger public health or\nwelfare.\u201d Id. \u00a7 7521(a)(1). Thus, \u201cany regulated air pollutant\u201d is,\nin this context, the only plausible reading of \u201cany air pollutant.\u201d\n\n         We find further support for this definition throughout\nthe CAA. First, as previously mentioned, the PSD program\nprovides that all major emitting facilities must install BACT for\n\f                               57\n\n\u201ceach pollutant subject to regulation under [the CAA].\u201d Id.\n\u00a7 7475(a)(4). \u201cEach pollutant subject to regulation under\u201d the\nAct is, of course, synonymous with \u201cany air pollutant regulated\nunder the Act.\u201d Thus, EPA\u2019s interpretation of \u201cany air pollutant\u201d\nin the definition of \u201cmajor emitting facilities\u201d harmonizes the\nPSD program\u2019s scope (i.e., which pollutants trigger PSD\ncoverage) with its substantive requirements (i.e., which\npollutants must be controlled to obtain a permit). In other words,\nbecause a covered source must control greenhouse gas\nemissions, it makes sense that major emissions of greenhouse\ngases would subject that source to the PSD program.\n\n    Second, a PSD permittee is required to establish that it\n\n       will not cause, or contribute to, air pollution in excess of\n       any (A) maximum allowable increase or maximum\n       allowable concentration for any pollutant in any area to\n       which this part applies more than one time per year, (B)\n       national ambient air quality standard in any air quality\n       control region, or (C) any other applicable emission\n       standard or standard of performance under [the CAA].\n\nId. \u00a7 7475(a)(3). Subsections (A) and (B) prohibit a permitted\nsource from contributing to a concentration of NAAQS\npollutants that exceeds EPA\u2019s standards. By contrast, subsection\n(C) has an entirely different focus: it prohibits a permitted\nsource from causing or contributing to air pollution in excess of\nany CAA emission standard. Thus, as EPA notes, \u201cwhat this\nprovision establishes is that while the PSD program was\ncertainly directed towards NAAQS-criteria pollutants, it also\nwas directed at maintaining air quality for other pollutants\nregulated under other provisions.\u201d EPA Timing & Tailoring Br.\n101. EPA\u2019s determination that \u201cany air pollutant\u201d means \u201cany\nair pollutant regulated under the Act\u201d\u2014encompassing the\ngreenhouse gases regulated under Title II\u2014is entirely consistent\n\f                                 58\n\nwith this focus.\n\n     Finally, Congress made perfectly clear that the PSD\nprogram was meant to protect against precisely the types of\nharms caused by greenhouse gases. The PSD provision contains\na section entitled \u201cCongressional declaration of purpose,\u201d which\nprovides, in relevant part, that \u201c[t]he purposes of this part\nare . . . to protect public health and welfare from any actual or\npotential adverse effect which in the Administrator\u2019s judgment\nmay reasonably be anticipated to occur from air pollution.\u201d 42\nU.S.C. \u00a7 7470(1). The CAA further provides that \u201c[a]ll language\nreferring to effects on welfare includes, but is not limited to,\neffects on . . . weather . . . and climate.\u201d Id. \u00a7 7602(h). As\npreviously noted, EPA in the Endangerment Finding\n\u201cmarshaled . . . substantial . . . . scientific evidence . . . for the\nproposition that greenhouse gases trap heat on earth that would\notherwise dissipate into space [and] that this \u2018greenhouse effect\u2019\nwarms the climate.\u201d Part II, supra at 28\u201329. It further concluded\nthat this \u201canthropogenically induced climate change\u201d was likely\nto threaten the public welfare through, among other things,\n\u201cextreme weather events.\u201d Id. at 15\u201316. Thus, one express\npurpose of the program is to protect against the harms caused by\ngreenhouse gases.\n\n     In sum, we are faced with a statutory term\u2014\u201cany air\npollutant\u201d\u2014that the Supreme Court has determined is\n\u201cexpansive,\u201d and \u201cunambiguous[ly]\u201d includes greenhouse gases.\nMassachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. at 529. Moreover, the PSD\nprogram requires covered sources to install control technology\nfor \u201ceach pollutant\u201d regulated under the CAA, 42 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 7475(a)(4), and to establish that they \u201cwill not cause, or\ncontribute to, air pollution in excess of any . . . emission\nstandard . . . under [the CAA].\u201d Id. \u00a7 7475(a)(3) (emphasis\nadded). These provisions demonstrate that the PSD program was\nintended to control pollutants regulated under every section of\n\f                                59\n\nthe Act. Finally, Congress\u2019s \u201cDeclaration of Purpose\u201d expressly\nstates that the PSD program was meant, in part, to protect\nagainst adverse effects on \u201cweather\u201d and \u201cclimate\u201d\u2014precisely\nthe types of harm caused by greenhouse gases. See id. \u00a7 7470(1).\nGiven all this, we have little trouble concluding that \u201cany air\npollutant\u201d in the definition of \u201cmajor emitting facility\u201d\nunambiguously means \u201cany air pollutant regulated under the\nCAA.\u201d\n\n                                B.\n\n    Industry Petitioners offer three alternative interpretations of\nthe PSD permitting triggers, none of which cast doubt on the\nunambiguous nature of the statute.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, we note that none of Petitioners\u2019\nalternative interpretations applies to Title V. To the contrary, all\nof the proposed alternative interpretations are based on the\nstructure of\u2014and purported Congressional intent behind\u2014the\nPSD program. Indeed, Industry Petitioners never argue that their\nproposed alternative interpretations are relevant to Title V.\nPetitioners have thus forfeited any challenges to EPA\u2019s\ngreenhouse gas-inclusive interpretation of Title V. See, e.g.,\nNat\u2019l Steel & Shipbuilding Co. v. NLRB, 156 F.3d 1268, 1273\n(D.C. Cir. 1998) (petitioners forfeit an argument by failing to\nraise it in their opening brief).\n\n\n\n     Industry Petitioners\u2019 first alternative is simple enough.\nBecause the PSD program focuses on \u201cthe air people breathe in\ncertain geographically defined . . . areas,\u201d Coalition for\nResponsible Reg. Timing & Tailoring Br. 38, Industry\nPetitioners contend that the term \u201cpollutant\u201d in the PSD statute\nencompasses only air pollutants that, unlike greenhouse gases,\n\f                                60\n\n\u201cpollute locally.\u201d Id. at 35. Industry Petitioners would thus apply\na greenhouse gas-exclusive interpretation of \u201cpollutant\u201d\nthroughout the statute\u2019s PSD provision. Under this reading, a\nsource would qualify as a \u201cmajor emitting facility\u201d only if it\nemits 100/250 tpy of \u201cany air pollutant\u201d except greenhouse\ngases. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7479(1). Moreover, sources that are\nsubject to PSD permitting requirements would be required to\ninstall BACT for \u201ceach pollutant subject to regulation under [the\nCAA]\u201d\u2014except greenhouse gases. Id. \u00a7 7475(a)(4).\n\n     We can easily dispose of Industry Petitioners\u2019 argument that\nthe PSD program\u2019s \u201cconcerns with local emissions,\u201d Coalition\nfor Responsible Reg. Timing & Tailoring Br. 36, somehow limit\nthe BACT provision. The statutory text provides, without\nqualification, that covered sources must install the \u201cbest\navailable control technology for each pollutant subject to\nregulation under [the CAA].\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7475(a)(4) (emphasis\nadded). Because greenhouse gases are indisputably a pollutant\nsubject to regulation under the Act, it is crystal clear that PSD\npermittees must install BACT for greenhouse gases. \u201cWhen the\nwords of a statute are unambiguous . . . judicial inquiry is\ncomplete.\u201d Connecticut Nat\u2019l Bank v. Germain, 503 U.S. 249,\n254 (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n     Equally without merit is Industry Petitioners\u2019 argument that\nthe PSD program\u2019s regional focus requires a greenhouse gas-\nexclusive interpretation of \u201cany air pollutant\u201d in the definition\nof \u201cmajor emitting facility.\u201d In support of this contention,\nIndustry Petitioners note that CAA Section 161 provides that\nstates\u2019 implementation plans for the PSD program \u201cshall contain\nemission limitations and such other measures as may be\nnecessary . . . to prevent significant deterioration of air quality\nin each region.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7471 (emphasis added). The term\n\u201cair quality,\u201d Industry Petitioners contend, implies a focus on\n\u201cthe air people breathe,\u201d and the term \u201cin each region\u201d suggests\n\f                               61\n\nthat Congress was concerned about local, not global, effects. See\nCoalition for Responsible Reg. Timing & Tailoring Br. 36.\nMoreover, Industry Petitioners note that when Congress enacted\nthe PSD program in 1977, it did so \u201cagainst the backdrop of a\nknown universe of CAA-regulated pollutants.\u201d Id. All these\npollutants, Industry Petitioners argue, \u201cwere regulated because\nthey could cause elevated ground-level concentrations in\nambient air people breathe.\u201d Id. And as Industry Petitioners\npoint out, EPA itself has concluded that greenhouse gases are\nproblematic for reasons other than local health and\nenvironmental concerns. In EPA\u2019s Advance Notice of Proposed\nRulemaking for the regulations at issue here, for example, the\nagency noted that \u201c[a] significant difference between the major\n[greenhouse gases] and most air pollutants regulated under the\nCAA is that [greenhouse gases] have much longer atmospheric\nlifetimes [and] . . . can remain in the atmosphere for decades to\ncenturies.\u201d Regulating Greenhouse Gas Emissions Under the\nClean Air Act (\u201cGreenhouse Gas Advance Notice\u201d), 73 Fed.\nReg. 44,354, 44,400\u201301 (July 30, 2008). Moreover, \u201cunlike\ntraditional air pollutants,\u201d greenhouse gases \u201cbecome well\nmixed throughout the global atmosphere so that the long-term\ndistribution of [greenhouse gas] concentrations is not dependant\non local emission sources.\u201d Id. Thus, Industry Petitioners\nconclude, greenhouse gases are problematic for reasons entirely\ndistinct from the local concerns that provided the basis for the\nPSD program. Given this, the phrase \u201cany air pollutant\u201d cannot\nbe applied to greenhouse gases in the context of the regionally-\nfocused PSD program.\n\n     As an initial matter, we note that the Supreme Court\nrejected a very similar argument in Massachusetts v. EPA.\nThere, EPA attempted to distinguish between greenhouse gases\nand other air pollution agents \u201cbecause greenhouse gases\npermeate the world\u2019s atmosphere rather than a limited area near\nthe earth\u2019s surface.\u201d Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. at 529\n\f                                62\n\nn.26. The Court held that this was \u201ca plainly unreasonable\nreading of a sweeping statutory provision designed to capture\n\u2018any physical, chemical . . . substance or matter which is emitted\ninto or otherwise enters the ambient air,\u201d id. (quoting 42 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 7602(g)), thus rejecting the dissent\u2019s view that \u201cEPA\u2019s\nexclusion of greenhouse gases . . . is entitled to deference.\u201d Id.\nAs the Court noted, the purported distinction between\ngreenhouse gases and \u201ctraditional\u201d air pollutants \u201cfinds no\nsupport in the text of the statute, which uses the phrase \u2018the\nambient air\u2019 without distinguishing between atmospheric\nlayers.\u201d Id. Massachusetts v. EPA thus forecloses Industry\nPetitioners\u2019 argument that because greenhouse gases do not\n\u201ccause elevated ground-level concentrations in ambient air\npeople breathe,\u201d Coalition for Responsible Reg. Timing &\nTailoring Br. 36, EPA should have adopted a greenhouse gas-\nexclusive interpretation of \u201cany air pollutant.\u201d\n\n     We also have little trouble disposing of Industry Petitioners\u2019\nargument that the PSD program is specifically focused solely on\nlocalized air pollution. True, as Industry Petitioners note, one\npart of the PSD program requires states to \u201cprevent significant\ndeterioration of air quality in each region.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7471\n(emphasis added). But while localized air quality is obviously\none concern of the PSD program, a comprehensive reading of\nthe statute shows it was also meant to address a much broader\nrange of harms. As an initial matter, the PSD provision\u2019s\n\u201cCongressional declaration of purpose\u201d section expansively\nprovides that the program is intended \u201cto protect public health\nand welfare from any actual or potential adverse effect . . . from\nair pollution.\u201d Id. \u00a7 7470(1) (emphasis added). Nothing in this\nsection limits the PSD program to adverse effects on local air\nquality; to the contrary, the word \u201cany\u201d here gives this clause an\n\u201cexpansive meaning\u201d which we see \u201cno reason to contravene.\u201d\nNew York, 443 F.3d at 885 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nIndeed, the CAA expressly provides that effects on \u201cwelfare\u201d\n\f                                63\n\nmeans \u201ceffects on . . . weather . . . and climate.\u201d 42 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 7602(h). It seems quite clear to us, then, that the PSD program\nwas intended to protect against precisely the types of harms\ncaused by greenhouse gases. This broad understanding of the\nPSD program\u2019s scope is buttressed by the fact that the program\nrequires covered sources to control \u201ceach pollutant subject to\nregulation under [the CAA],\u201d and further requires sources to\ncomply with \u201cany . . . emission standard\u201d under the CAA. Id. \u00a7\u00a7\n7475(a)(3); (a)(4) (emphasis added). These substantive\nrequirements amount to further evidence that Congress wanted\nthe PSD program to cover all regulated pollutants, regardless of\nthe type of harm those pollutants cause.\n\n     In light of the PSD program\u2019s broad scope of regulation and\nthe express purposes of the program, we conclude\u2014consistent\nwith the Supreme Court in Massachusetts v. EPA\u2014that Industry\nPetitioners\u2019 greenhouse gas-exclusive interpretation of\n\u201cpollutant\u201d is \u201ca plainly unreasonable reading\u201d of the statute.\nMassachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. at 529 n.26.\n\n                                2.\n\n          For their second alternative interpretation, Industry\nPetitioners argue that the PSD program\u2019s definition of \u201cmajor\nemitting facility\u201d establishes a \u201cpollutant-specific situs\nrequirement.\u201d Am. Chemistry Council Br. 33. Under this\nreading of the statute, a stationary source is subject to PSD\npermitting requirements only if \u201c(1) a source has major\nemissions of a NAAQS criteria pollutant and (2) the source is\nlocated in an area attaining that pollutant\u2019s\u201d air quality standard.\nCoalition for Responsible Reg. Timing & Tailoring Br. 23.\nThus, for example, a source would be subject to the PSD\npermitting requirements if it 1) emits over 100/250 tpy of sulfur\ndioxide (a NAAQS criteria pollutant), and 2) is located in an\narea that is in \u201cattainment,\u201d or is \u201cunclassifiable,\u201d for sulfur\n\f                                64\n\ndioxide. But under this approach, a stationary source could\nnever be subject to the PSD program solely because of its\ngreenhouse gas emissions. After all, Industry Petitioners\nobserve, EPA declined to make greenhouse gases a NAAQS\ncriteria pollutant. Instead, EPA regulated greenhouse gases only\nunder Title II of the Act, dealing with motor vehicle emissions.\nBecause \u201cno major source of [greenhouse gases] can be located\nin an area attaining the nonexistent [air quality standard] for\n[greenhouse gases],\u201d id. at 24, Industry Petitioners point out that\ntheir reading of the statute would bring no new stationary\nsources under the PSD program\u2019s ambit\u2014alleviating any\n\u201cabsurd results\u201d caused by excessive permitting requirements,\nid. at 25.\n\n      Industry Petitioners emphasize that, unlike their first\nproposed alternative, nothing in this approach would \u201cwholly\nexempt [greenhouse gases] from PSD.\u201d Coalition for\nResponsible Reg. Timing & Tailoring Reply Br. 20. Although\na pollutant-specific situs requirement would limit the number of\nsources subject to the PSD program, nothing in this proposed\nreading of the statute would alter the substantive requirements\nfor PSD permits, including the requirement that all regulated\nsources install BACT \u201cfor each pollutant subject to regulation\nunder [the CAA].\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7475(a)(4). So, for example,\nunder this interpretation, a hypothetical stationary source\nemitting more than 100/250 tpy of sulfur dioxide and located in\nan area designated as \u201cin attainment\u201d for sulfur dioxide, must\nstill install BACT for \u201ceach pollutant subject to regulation\u201d\nunder the Act, including greenhouse gases. Their key point,\nthough, is that sources emitting only major amounts of\ngreenhouse gases\u2014but not major amounts of a NAAQS criteria\npollutant\u2014would escape PSD permitting requirements.\n\n     Industry Petitioners\u2019 argument in support of this\ninterpretation proceeds in several steps. First, they argue that the\n\f                                65\n\nterm \u201cany air pollutant,\u201d though \u201ccapacious and flexible by\nitself,\u201d \u201cis a chameleon term\u201d when placed in certain contexts.\nAm. Chemistry Council Br. 38. Indeed, Industry Petitioners note\nthat EPA has already narrowed the literal meaning of the term\n\u201cany air pollutant\u201d here. After all, and as discussed supra,\nalthough the statutory term \u201cair pollutant\u201d includes \u201cany\nphysical [or] chemical . . . substance or matter,\u201d 42 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 7602(g), EPA has long maintained that the term \u201cany air\npollutant\u201d in the definition of \u201cmajor emitting facility\u201d\nencompasses only air pollutants regulated under the Act.\nMoreover, Industry Petitioners point out that when interpreting\nCAA Part C, Subpart 2, entitled \u201cVisibility Protection,\u201d EPA\ndetermined that the term \u201cany pollutant\u201d in the definition of\n\u201cmajor stationary source\u201d meant \u201cany visibility-impairing\npollutant.\u201d See Coalition for Responsible Reg. Timing &\nTailoring Br. 34 (emphasis added). The statute\u2019s definition of\n\u201cmajor stationary source\u201d in the visibility-protection subpart is\nquite similar to the definition of \u201cmajor emitting facility\u201d in the\nPSD subpart: for the purposes of the visibility program, a \u201cmajor\nstationary source\u201d is defined as a \u201cstationary source[ ] with the\npotential to emit 250 tons or more of any pollutant.\u201d 42 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 7491(g)(7)); compare 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7479(1) (\u201cmajor emitting\nfacility\u201d for the purposes of the PSD program is a source which\n\u201cemit[s], or [has] the potential to emit,\u201d either 100 or 250 tons\nper year \u201cof any air pollutant\u201d). These narrowed interpretations,\nIndustry Petitioners argue, prove that the seemingly capacious\nterm \u201cany air pollutant\u201d is, notwithstanding that the Supreme\nCourt called this term \u201cexpansive\u201d and \u201csweeping,\u201d\nMassachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. at 529 nn.25\u201326, capable of a\nfar more circumscribed meaning.\n\n     According to Industry Petitioners, EPA should have adopted\nthat more circumscribed meaning by interpreting \u201cany air\npollutant\u201d as establishing a pollutant-specific situs requirement.\nAs Industry Petitioners point out, the PSD program requires\n\f                                66\n\npermits for \u201cmajor emitting facilit[ies] . . . in any area to which\nthis part applies,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7479(1), and defines \u201cmajor\nemitting facilities\u201d as stationary sources emitting 100/250 tpy of\n\u201cany air pollutant.\u201d Id. \u00a7 7475(a). In this context, Industry\nPetitioners contend, the phrases \u201cany air pollutant\u201d and \u201cin any\narea to which this part applies\u201d must be read in concert. And,\nIndustry Petitioners argue, these phrases \u201ctogether mean\u201d that a\nsource is subject to PSD permitting requirements only if it emits\nmajor amounts of \u201cany [NAAQS] air pollutant whose NAAQS\nan area is attaining.\u201d Am. Chemistry Council Br. 33.\n\n     In support of this supposedly holistic interpretation of the\nstatute, Industry Petitioners cite CAA \u00a7 163(b), a different\nsection of the PSD provision in which the phrase \u201cany air\npollutant\u201d and \u201cany area to which this part applies\u201d are used in\nconjunction with one another. Unlike \u00a7 165(a), which sets\npermitting requirements for sources covered by the PSD\nprogram, \u00a7 163 provides guidelines for areas designated as \u201cin\nattainment\u201d under the program. Specifically, \u00a7 163(b) limits the\n\u201cmaximum allowable increase in concentrations of\u201d airborne\nNAAQS pollutants that may occur in an attainment area before\nthat area\u2019s \u201cattainment\u201d status is jeopardized. See 42 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 7473(b)(1). Subsections (1) through (3) of \u00a7 163(b)\u2014not\ndirectly relevant here\u2014set limits on the maximum allowable\nincreases for two specific NAAQS pollutants, sulfur dioxide and\nparticulate matter. Subsection (4) is a catchall provision, which\nlimits the maximum allowable increases for all other NAAQS\npollutants. It is in subsection (4) that Industry Petitioners find\nwhat they believe is their payoff: the terms \u201cany air pollutant\u201d\nand \u201cany area to which this part applies\u201d in conjunction with one\nanother. Section 163(b)(4) provides:\n\n    The maximum allowable concentration of any air pollutant\n    in any area to which this part applies shall not exceed a\n    concentration for such pollutant for each period of exposure\n\f                                67\n\n    equal to\u2014\n           (A) the concentration permitted under the national\n           secondary ambient air quality standard, or\n           (B) the concentration permitted under the national\n           primary ambient air quality standard,\n    whichever concentration is lowest for such pollutant for\n    such period of exposure.\n\n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7473(b)(4) (emphasis added). As Industry\nPetitioners correctly point out, in this context the phrase \u201cany air\npollutant\u201d must mean \u201cany NAAQS pollutant,\u201d and \u201cin any area\nto which this part applies\u201d must mean \u201cany area that is in\nattainment for that NAAQS pollutant.\u201d After all, the statute\nstates that the \u201cmaximum allowable concentration of any air\npollutant . . . shall not exceed\u201d either the primary or secondary\nnational ambient air quality standards. But, as Industry\nPetitioners observe, national ambient air standards exist only for\nNAAQS pollutants, so even if \u201cany air pollutant\u201d in CAA\n\u00a7 163(b)(4) was read to include non-NAAQS pollutants, the\nphrase, in context, would have no practical effect for those\npollutants. Moreover, \u201cany area to which this part applies\u201d must\nmean \u201cany area that is in attainment for that NAAQS pollutant,\u201d\nbecause if an area was in nonattainment for a particular\npollutant, Part D\u2014rather than the PSD program\u2014would govern\nemissions limits for that specific pollutant. See id. \u00a7 7501(2)\n(\u201c[t]he term \u2018nonattainment area\u2019 means, for any air pollutant,\nan area which is designated \u2018nonattainment\u2019 with respect to that\npollutant\u201d); \u00a7 7502(c) (setting out required \u201cNonattainment plan\nprovisions\u201d). Finally, Industry Petitioners correctly note that a\npollutant-specific reading of the phrase \u201cair pollutant\u201d must also\napply to CAA \u00a7 165(a)(3)(A), which prohibits PSD permittees\nfrom \u201ccaus[ing], or contribut[ing] to, air pollution in excess of\nany . . . maximum allowable concentration for any air pollutant\nin any area to which this part applies more than one time per\nyear.\u201d Id. \u00a7 7475(a)(3)(A) (emphasis added). This clause, as\n\f                                68\n\nIndustry Petitioners point out, piggybacks off the NAAQS\npollutant-specific definition of \u201cmaximum allowable\nconcentration\u201d in \u00a7 163(b)(4), prophylactically restricting PSD\npermittees from endangering an area\u2019s attainment status. See\nAm. Chemistry Council Br. 32 (describing the interplay between\nthe two provisions as \u201cSection 163(b)(4) (and Section\n165(a)(3)(A), which implements it) . . .\u201d).\n\n     Based on all of this, Industry Petitioners conclude that\nbecause the phrase \u201cany air pollutant in any area to which this\npart applies\u201d in \u00a7 163(b)(4) means \u201cany NAAQS pollutant in\nany area in attainment for that NAAQS pollutant,\u201d an identical\nreading must apply to the definition of \u201cmajor emitting facility.\u201d\nAs a result, a stationary source may be subject to the PSD\nprogram only if it emits 100/250 tpy of any NAAQS pollutant\nand is located in an area designated as in attainment for that\nNAAQS pollutant. We are unpersuaded.\n\n     Although we agree that the term \u201cany air pollutant\u201d is, in\nsome contexts, capable of narrower interpretations, we see\nnothing in the definition of \u201cmajor emitting facility\u201d that would\nallow EPA to adopt a NAAQS pollutant-specific reading of that\nphrase. The contrast with the visibility program is instructive.\nThere, EPA determined that \u201cany pollutant\u201d in the definition of\n\u201cmajor stationary source\u201d meant \u201cany visibility-impairing\npollutant.\u201d See 40 C.F.R. pt. 51, App. Y, \u00a7 II.A. But as EPA\nnotes, the entire visibility program, codified in CAA Part C,\nSubpart 2, deals with visibility-impairing pollutants, as reflected\nin that subpart\u2019s title: \u201cVisibility Protection.\u201d See 42 U.S.C.\nprec. \u00a7 7491. From this, \u201cit naturally follows that EPA\u2019s\nregulations under that section should address \u2018visibility-\nimpairing pollutants.\u2019 \u201d EPA Timing & Tailoring Br. 99 n.19.\nNo similar guidance can be garnered from Part C, Subpart 1,\nwhich contains the phrase \u201cany air pollutant\u201d at issue here.\nDealing with far more than NAAQS pollutants, Part C, Subpart\n\f                                69\n\n1 requires, for example, covered sources to install BACT for\n\u201ceach pollutant subject to regulation under [the CAA].\u201d 42\nU.S.C. \u00a7 7475(a)(4). Indeed, Subpart 1 is simply\u2014and\nexpansively\u2014entitled \u201cClean Air.\u201d Id. prec. \u00a7 7470. Moreover,\nCongress designed the PSD program broadly to protect against\n\u201cadverse effect[s]\u201d on \u201cpublic health and welfare,\u201d Id.\n\u00a7 7470(1), including effects on global problems like weather and\nclimate. Id. \u00a7 7602(h).\n\n     Furthermore, the phrases \u201cany air pollutant\u201d and \u201cin any\narea to which this part applies\u201d are used differently in Section\n163(b)(4) and in the PSD program\u2019s definition of \u201cmajor\nemitting facility.\u201d The presumption that \u201c[a] term appearing in\nseveral places in a statutory text is generally read the same way\neach time it appears,\u201d Ratzlaf v. United States, 510 U.S. 135,\n143 (1994), \u201creadily yields whenever there is such variation in\nthe connection in which the words are used as reasonably to\nwarrant the conclusion that they were employed in different\nparts of the act with different intent,\u201d Atl. Cleans & Dryers, Inc.\nv. United States, 286 U.S. 427, 433 (1933). Here, the focus and\nstructure of \u00a7 163(b)(4) is entirely distinct from the PSD\npermitting trigger. Section 163(b)(4) provides that \u201c[t]he\nmaximum allowable concentration of any air pollutant in any\narea to which this part applies shall not exceed a [particular]\nconcentration.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7473(b)(4). By contrast, \u00a7 165(a)\nprovides that \u201c[n]o major emitting facility . . . may be\nconstructed in any area to which this part applies\u201d unless certain\nconditions are met, id. \u00a7 7475(a), and \u00a7 169(1) defines \u201cmajor\nemitting facility\u201d as any stationary source that emits or has the\npotential to emit threshold amounts of \u201cany air pollutant,\u201d id. \u00a7\n7479(1). The differences between these two provisions are\nmanifest. In \u00a7 163(b)(4), the phrases \u201cany air pollutant\u201d and \u201cin\nany area to which this part applies\u201d appear next to one another,\nand it is the concentration of the pollutant in an area that\nmatters. In the PSD permitting trigger, the phrases appear in\n\f                                70\n\ndifferent subsections and it is the location of the facility that\nmatters. Section 163(b)(4) thus does nothing to undermine the\nunambiguous meaning of \u201cany air pollutant\u201d in the definition of\n\u201cmajor emitting facility.\u201d\n\n      Industry Petitioners\u2019 pollutant-specific reading of \u201cany air\npollutant\u201d is further undermined by contrasting Part C of the Act\n(the PSD program) with Part D (which regulates areas in\nnonattainment). Unlike Part C, Part D is expressly pollutant-\nspecific, providing that \u201c[t]he term \u2018nonattainment area\u2019 means,\nfor any air pollutant, an area which is designated\n\u2018nonattainment\u2019 with respect to that pollutant.\u201d Id. \u00a7 7501(2)\n(emphasis added). Congress thus clearly knew how to\npromulgate a narrow, pollutant-specific definition of \u201cany air\npollutant.\u201d That it did so in Part D but not in Part C strongly\nsuggests that the phrase \u201cany air pollutant\u201d in Part C was meant\nto be construed broadly. Keene Corp. v. United States, 508 U.S.\n200, 208 (1993) (\u201c[W]here Congress includes particular\nlanguage in one section of a statute but omits it in another . . . ,\nit is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and\npurposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\u201d) (quoting\nRussello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983)).\n\n     A final point: Industry Petitioners observe that every area\nin the country has always been in attainment for at least one\nNAAQS criteria pollutant. See Tailoring Rule, 75 Fed. Reg. at\n31,561. Thus, pursuant to EPA\u2019s pollutant-indifferent reading of\n\u00a7 165(a), under which a major emitting facility must abide by\nPSD requirements so long as it is located in an attainment area\nfor any NAAQS pollutant, every facility in the United States has\nalways been in an \u201carea to which this part applies.\u201d\nConsequently, Industry Petitioners argue, \u201c[i]f EPA\u2019s\ninterpretation were right, Congress simply could have left out\nthe phrase \u2018in any area to which this part applies\u2019\u201d in the PSD\npermitting trigger. Am. Chemistry Council Br. 36. But\n\f                               71\n\n\u201cCongress does not enact \u2018stillborn\u2019 laws,\u201d id. (quoting Sosa v.\nAlvarez-Machain, 542 U.S. 692, 714 (2004)), and interpretations\nthat render statutory language superfluous are disfavored. Am.\nChemistry Council Reply Br. 19. The fact that the PSD program\nhas applied nationwide since its inception, Industry Petitioners\nconclude, thus militates against EPA\u2019s pollutant-indifferent\napproach.\n\n     This argument fails at its premise, for Industry Petitioners\nconfuse a lack of practical import with a lack of meaning. To\nsay that the phrase \u201cin any area to which this part applies\u201d is\ncurrently without practical import is quite different than showing\nthat the phrase means nothing. Indeed, under different\ncircumstances, the phrase would have a significant effect. If,\nhypothetically, one area of the country was designated as\n\u201cnonattainment\u201d for every NAAQS pollutant, the phrase \u201cin any\narea to which this part applies\u201d would limit PSD coverage, as\ncovered sources in that area would be subject only to Part D\nrequirements. In fact, Environmental Intervenors point out that\nwhen Congress drafted the PSD permitting triggers \u201cthe\nprospect that some areas could be in nonattainment for all\nNAAQS was not far-fetched.\u201d Sierra Club Historic Reg. Br. 23.\n\u201cIn the years leading up to 1977, EPA air quality data identified\na number of areas that failed to meet all five of the then-current\n[air quality standards] for which EPA had gathered data.\u201d Id.\nAccordingly, \u201cin any area to which this part applies\u201d is a\nmeaningful phrase under EPA\u2019s pollutant-indifferent\ninterpretation of the PSD permitting triggers: it provides that\nsources need not obtain PSD permits if they are located in areas\ndesignated \u201cnonattainment\u201d for all six NAAQS pollutants.\n\n    In short, although we agree with Industry Petitioners that\nphrases like \u201cany air pollutant\u201d are, in certain contexts, capable\nof a more limited meaning, they have failed to identify any\nreasons that the phrase should be read narrowly here. Nor do we\n\f                               72\n\nknow of one. We thus conclude that EPA\u2019s 34-year-old\ninterpretation of the PSD permitting triggers is statutorily\ncompelled: a source must obtain a permit if it emits major\namounts of any regulated pollutant and is located in an area that\nis in attainment or unclassifiable for any NAAQS pollutant.\n\n                               3.\n\n     We can quickly dispose of Industry Petitioners\u2019 third\nalternative interpretation, namely, that in order to regulate new\npollutants through the PSD program, EPA was required to go\nthrough the process prescribed by CAA \u00a7 166. Section 166\nprovides specific steps that EPA must take when designating\nnew \u201cpollutants for which national ambient air quality\nstandards\u201d apply. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7476(a). Here, Industry\nPetitioners argue, EPA unlawfully failed to follow the steps laid\nout in Section 166, including a required study of the pollutant\nand a one-year delay before the effective date of regulations,\nbefore adding greenhouse gases \u201cto the PSD [c]onstellation.\u201d\nCoalition for Responsible Reg. Timing & Tailoring Br. 41.\n\n     This argument fails on its face. By its terms, \u00a7 166 applies\nonly to new \u201cpollutants for which national ambient air quality\nstandards\u201d apply, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7476(a) (emphasis added), i.e.,\nNAAQS criteria pollutants for which regions may be classified\nas in \u201cattainment,\u201d \u201cnon-attainment,\u201d or \u201cunclassifiable.\u201d And\nEPA never classified greenhouse gases as a NAAQS criteria\npollutant. Instead, it simply determined that under \u00a7 165, major\nemitters of greenhouse gases are subject to the PSD program and\nall covered sources must install BACT for greenhouse gases.\nContrary to Industry Petitioners\u2019 arguments, then, \u00a7 166 has no\nbearing on this addition of greenhouse gases into \u201cthe PSD\n[c]onstellation.\u201d Coalition for Responsible Reg. Timing &\nTailoring Br. 41. Indeed, we rejected a nearly identical argument\nin Alabama Power, holding that there is \u201cno implied or apparent\n\f                               73\n\nconflict between sections 165 and 166; nor . . . must the\nrequirements of section 165 be \u2018subsumed\u2019 with those of section\n166.\u201d Alabama Power, 636 F.2d at 406. Stating what should\nhave been obvious from the text of the statute, we concluded:\n\u201c[S]ection 166 has a different focus from section 165.\u201d Id.\n\n     Thus, because EPA has never classified greenhouse gases\nas a NAAQS criteria pollutant, the \u00a7 166 requirements are\nentirely inapplicable here. This section of the CAA has\nabsolutely no bearing on our conclusion that EPA\u2019s\ninterpretation of the PSD permitting trigger is compelled by the\nstatute itself.\n\n                               VI.\n\n     Having concluded that the CAA requires PSD and Title V\npermits for major emitters of greenhouse gases, we turn to\nPetitioners\u2019 challenges to the Tailoring and Timing Rules\nthemselves.\n\n     As an initial matter, we note that Petitioners fail to make\nany real arguments against the Timing Rule. To be sure, at one\npoint State Petitioners contend that the Timing Rule constitutes\nan attempt \u201cto extend the PSD and Title V permitting\nrequirements to greenhouse-gas emissions,\u201d State Pet\u2019rs\u2019 Timing\n& Tailoring Br. 67. This is plainly incorrect. As discussed in the\nprevious section, greenhouse gases are regulated under PSD and\nTitle V pursuant to automatic operation of the CAA. All the\nTiming Rule did was delay the applicability of these programs,\nproviding that major emitters of greenhouse gases would be\nsubject to PSD and Title V permitting requirements only once\nthe Tailpipe Rule actually took effect on January 2, 2011. See\nTiming Rule, 75 Fed. Reg. at 17,017-19. Despite this,\nPetitioners confusingly urge us to vacate \u201c[t]he Tailoring and\nTiming Rules,\u201d e.g. State Pet\u2019rs\u2019 Timing & Tailoring Br. 24\n\f                               74\n\n(emphasis added), although it is unclear what practical effect\nvacature of the Timing Rule would have. Nonetheless, given this\nphrasing of their argument, and given our conclusion that\nPetitioners lack Article III standing to challenge both rules, we\nshall, where appropriate, discuss the Timing Rule in conjunction\nwith the Tailoring Rule.\n\n     In the Tailoring Rule, EPA announced that it was \u201crelieving\noverwhelming permitting burdens that would, in the absence of\nthis rule, fall on permitting authorities and sources.\u201d Tailoring\nRule, 75 Fed. Reg. at 31,516. Although the PSD statute requires\npermits for sources with the potential to emit 100/250 tpy of\n\u201cany air pollutant,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7479(1), EPA noted that\nimmediate application of that threshold to greenhouse gas-\nemitting sources would cause permit applications to jump from\n280 per year to over 81,000 per year. Tailoring Rule, 75 Fed.\nReg. at 31,554. Many of these applications would come from\ncommercial and residential sources, which would \u201ceach incur,\non average, almost $60,000 in PSD permitting expenses.\u201d Id. at\n31,556. Similarly, if the Title V 100 tpy threshold applied\nimmediately to greenhouse gases, sources needing operating\npermits would jump from 14,700 per year to 6.1 million per\nyear. Id. at 31,562. \u201cThe great majority of these sources would\nbe small commercial and residential sources\u201d which \u201cwould\nincur, on average, expenses of $23,175.\u201d Id. And were\npermitting authorities required to hire the 230,000 full-time\nemployees necessary to address these permit applications,\n\u201cauthorities would face over $21 billion in additional permitting\ncosts each year due to [greenhouse gases], compared to the\ncurrent program cost of $62 million each year.\u201d Id. at 31,563.\n\n     Thus, instead of immediately requiring permits for all\nsources exceeding the 100/250 tpy emissions threshold, EPA\ndecided to \u201cphas[e] in the applicability of these programs to\n[greenhouse gas] sources, starting with the largest [greenhouse\n\f                               75\n\ngas] emitters.\u201d Id. at 31,514. The Tailoring Rule established the\nfirst two steps in this phased-in process. During Step One, only\nsources that were \u201csubject to PSD requirements for their\nconventional pollutants anyway\u201d (i.e., those sources that\nexceeded the statutory emissions threshold for non-greenhouse\ngas pollutants) were required to install BACT for their\ngreenhouse gas emissions. Id. at 31,567. Step Two, which took\neffect on July 1, 2011, also requires PSD permits for sources\nwith the potential to emit over 100,000 tpy CO2e after a\nproposed construction project, or 75,000 tpy CO2e after a\nproposed modification project. Id. at 31,523. Step Two further\nrequires Title V permits for sources which have the potential to\nemit over 100,000 tpy CO2e. Id. at 31,516. EPA has since\nproposed\u2014but has yet to finalize\u2014a \u201cStep Three,\u201d which would\nmaintain the current thresholds while the agency evaluates the\npossibility of regulating smaller sources. See EPA\u2019s 28(j) Letter\n1-2, February 27, 2012.\n\n     In the Tailoring Rule, EPA justified its phased-in approach\non three interrelated grounds, each of which rests on a distinct\ndoctrine of administrative law. First, EPA concluded \u201cthe costs\nto sources and administrative burdens . . . that would result from\n[immediate] application of the PSD and title V programs . . .at\nthe statutory levels . . . should be considered \u2018absurd results,\u2019\u201d\nwhich Congress never intended. Id. at 31,517; see Am. Water\nWorks Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 40 F.3d 1266, 1271 (D.C. Cir. 1994)\n(\u201c[W]here a literal reading of a statutory term would lead to\nabsurd results, the term simply has no meaning . . and is the\nproper subject of construction by EPA and the courts.\u201d). Thus,\nunder the \u201cabsurd results\u201d doctrine, EPA concluded that the PSD\nand Title V programs \u201cshould not [immediately] be read to\napply to all [greenhouse gas] sources at or above the 100/250\ntpy threshold.\u201d Tailoring Rule, 75 Fed. Reg. at 31,554. Second,\nemphasizing that immediate regulation at the 100/250 tpy\nthreshold would cause tremendous administrative burden, EPA\n\f                                76\n\njustified its deviation from this threshold on the basis of the\n\u201cadministrative necessity\u201d doctrine. Id. at 31,576; see Envtl. Def.\nFund, Inc. v. EPA, 636 F.2d 1267, 1283 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (\u201c[A]n\nagency may depart from the requirements of a regulatory statute\n. . . to cope with the administrative impossibility of applying the\ncommands of the substantive statute.\u201d). Finally, asserting that\nthere exists a judicial doctrine that allows agencies to implement\nregulatory programs in a piecemeal fashion, EPA stated that the\nTailoring Rule was justified pursuant to this \u201cone-step-at-a-\ntime\u201d doctrine. Tailoring Rule, 75 Fed. Reg. at 31,578; see\nMassachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. at 524 (\u201cAgencies, like\nlegislatures, do not generally resolve massive problems in one\nfell regulatory swoop.\u201d).\n\n     Petitioners\u2014particularly State Petitioners\u2014argue that none\nof these doctrines permit EPA to \u201cdepart unilaterally from the\n[CAA\u2019s] permitting thresholds and replace them with numbers\nof its own choosing.\u201d State Pet\u2019rs\u2019 Timing & Tailoring Br. 29.\nAdmitting the \u201clamentable policy consequences of adhering to\nthe unambiguous numerical thresholds in the Clean Air Act,\u201d\nState Petitioners rather colorfully argue that EPA\u2019s attempts to\nalleviate those burdens \u201cestablish only that EPA is acting as a\nbenevolent dictator rather than a tyrant.\u201d Id. at 26. And because\nEPA exceeded the boundaries of its lawful authority, Petitioners\nurge us to vacate the Tailoring Rule.\n\n     Before we may address the merits of these claims, however,\nwe must determine whether we have jurisdiction. \u201cNo\nprinciple,\u201d the Supreme Court has repeatedly explained, \u201cis\nmore fundamental to the judiciary\u2019s proper role in our system of\ngovernment than the constitutional limitation of federal-court\njurisdiction to actual cases or controversies.\u201d Raines v. Byrd,\n521 U.S. 811, 818 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nThe doctrine of standing \u201cis an essential and unchanging part of\nthe case-or-controversy requirement.\u201d Lujan v. Defenders of\n\f                                 77\n\nWildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992). To establish standing, a\npetitioner must have suffered an \u201cinjury in fact\u201d that is 1)\n\u201cconcrete and particularized . . . [and] actual or imminent, not\nconjectural or hypothetical,\u201d 2) was caused by the conduct\ncomplained of, and 3) is \u201clikely, as opposed to merely\nspeculative [to] be redressed by a favorable decision.\u201d Id. at\n560\u201361 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\n\n      Petitioners fall far short of these \u201cirreducible constitutional\n. . . elements\u201d of standing, id. at 560. Simply put, Petitioners\nhave failed to establish that the Timing and Tailoring Rules\ncaused them \u201cinjury in fact,\u201d much less injury that could be\nredressed by the Rules\u2019 vacatur. Industry Petitioners contend\nthat they are injured because they are subject to regulation of\ngreenhouse gases, Coalition for Responsible Reg. Timing &\nTailoring Br. 14. State Petitioners claim injury because they own\nsome regulated sources and because they now carry a heavier\nadministrative burden. State Pet\u2019rs\u2019 Timing & Tailoring Br.\n22\u201323. But as discussed above, see supra Part V, the CAA\nmandates PSD and Title V coverage for major emitters of\ngreenhouse gases. Thus, Industry Petitioners were regulated and\nState Petitioners required to issue permits not because of\nanything EPA did in the Timing and Tailoring Rules, but by\nautomatic operation of the statute. Given this, neither the Timing\nnor Tailoring Rules caused the injury Petitioners allege: having\nto comply with PSD and Title V for greenhouse gases.\n\n     Indeed, the Timing and Tailoring Rules actually mitigate\nPetitioners\u2019 purported injuries. Without the Timing Rule,\nPetitioners may well have been subject to PSD and Title V for\ngreenhouse gases before January 2, 2011. Without the Tailoring\nRule, an even greater number of industry and state-owned\nsources would be subject to PSD and Title V, and state\nauthorities would be overwhelmed with millions of additional\npermit applications. Thus, Petitioners have failed to \u201cshow that,\n\f                                78\n\nabsent the government\u2019s allegedly unlawful actions, there is a\nsubstantial probability that they would not be injured and that,\nif the court affords the relief requested, the injury will be\nremoved.\u201d Chamber of Commerce v. EPA, 642 F.3d 192, 201\n(D.C. Cir. 2011) (quotations and alterations omitted). Far from\nit. If anything, vacature of the Tailoring Rule would\nsignificantly exacerbate Petitioners\u2019 injuries.\n\n     Attempting to remedy this obvious jurisdictional defect,\nState Petitioners present two alternative theories, neither of\nwhich comes close to meeting the \u201cirreducible\nconstitutional . . . elements\u201d of standing. Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560.\nFirst, State Petitioners counterintuitively suggest that they\nactually want EPA to immediately \u201cappl[y] the 100/250 tpy\npermitting thresholds to greenhouse-gas emissions.\u201d State\nPet\u2019rs\u2019 Timing & Tailoring Reply Br. 15. Admitting that\nvacature of the Tailoring Rule would result in astronomical costs\nand unleash chaos on permitting authorities, State Petitioners\npredict that Congress will be forced to enact \u201ccorrective\nlegislation\u201d to relieve the overwhelming permitting burdens on\npermitting authorities and sources, thus mitigating their\npurported injuries. Id.\n\n      This theory fails. To establish standing, plaintiffs must\ndemonstrate that it is \u201clikely, as opposed to merely speculative,\nthat the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision,\u201d Lujan,\n504 U.S. at 561 (internal quotation marks omitted), but here,\nState Petitioners simply hypothesize that Congress will enact\n\u201ccorrective legislation.\u201d State Pet\u2019rs\u2019 Timing & Tailoring Reply\nBr. 15. We have serious doubts as to whether, for standing\npurposes, it is ever \u201clikely\u201d that Congress will enact legislation\nat all. After all, a proposed bill must make it through committees\nin both the House of Representatives and the Senate and garner\na majority of votes in both chambers\u2014overcoming, perhaps, a\nfilibuster in the Senate. If passed, the bill must then be signed\n\f                                79\n\ninto law by the President, or go back to Congress so that it may\nattempt to override his veto. As a generation of schoolchildren\nknows, \u201cby that time, it\u2019s very unlikely that [a bill will] become\na law. It\u2019s not easy to become a law.\u201d Schoolhouse Rock, I\u2019m\nJust a Bill, at 2:41, available at\nhttp://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=7266360872513258\n185# (last visited June 1, 2012).\n\n     And even if the astronomical costs associated with a\n100/250 tpy permitting threshold make some Congressional\naction likely, State Petitioners are still unable to show that it is\n\u201clikely, as opposed to merely speculative,\u201d Lujan, 504 U.S. at\n561, that Congress will redress their injury. State Petitioners\napparently assume that if the 100/250 tpy permitting threshold\nwas immediately applied to greenhouse gases, Congress would\nexempt those pollutants from the PSD and Title V programs\nentirely. But this is just one of many forms \u201ccorrective\nlegislation\u201d could take. For example, were we to vacate the\nTailoring Rule, Congress could decide to readopt its key\nprovisions in the PSD and Title V statutes. Or it could set PSD\nand Title V permitting thresholds at 25,000 tpy for greenhouse\ngases\u2014higher than the 100/250 tpy threshold, but lower (and\nthus more costly to Petitioners) than the thresholds promulgated\nin the Tailoring Rule. Or it could do something else entirely. All\nof this is guesswork, which is precisely the point: State\nPetitioners\u2019 faith that Congress will alleviate their injury is\ninherently speculative.\n\n     State Petitioners\u2019 second alternative theory of standing fares\nno better. In their reply brief, they contend that even if vacating\nthe Timing or Tailoring Rules would indeed exacerbate their\ncosts and administrative burdens (the purported injuries they\nclaimed in their opening brief), \u201cthen State Petitioners can\nestablish Article III standing under Massachusetts by asserting\ninjuries caused by EPA\u2019s failure to regulate sooner.\u201d State\n\f                                 80\n\nPet\u2019rs\u2019 Timing & Tailoring Reply Br. 5. Essentially, State\nPetitioners\u2019 reply brief contends that, contrary to the position\ntaken in the opening brief, they want more regulation, not less,\nand that they wanted regulation sooner rather than later. And\nbecause the Commonwealth of Massachusetts had standing to\nseek regulation of greenhouse gases in Massachusetts v. EPA,\nState Petitioners argue that they now have standing to seek more\nregulation of greenhouse gases as well.\n\n     This argument is completely without merit. As an initial\nmatter, we are aware of no authority which permits a party to\nassert an entirely new injury (and thus, an entirely new theory of\nstanding) in its reply brief. Quite to the contrary, we have held\nthat, where standing is not self-evident, \u201c[i]n its opening brief,\nthe petitioner should . . . include . . . a concise recitation of the\nbasis upon which it claims standing.\u201d Sierra Club v. EPA, 292\nF.3d 895, 901 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (emphasis added); see also D.C.\nCir. R. 28(a)(7) (\u201c[i]n cases involving direct review in this court\nof administrative actions, the brief of the appellant or petitioner\nmust set forth the basis for the claim of standing.\u201d); American\nLibrary Ass\u2019n v. FCC, 401 F.3d 489, 493\u201394 (D.C. Cir. 2005)\n(discussing limitations on this principle). After all, \u201cit is often\nthe case . . . that some of the relevant facts are known only to the\npetitioner, to the exclusion of both the respondent and the\ncourt.\u201d Sierra Club, 292 F.3d at 901. If \u201cthe petitioner does not\nsubmit evidence of those facts with its opening brief,\u201d the\nrespondent is \u201cleft to flail at the unknown in an attempt to prove\nthe negative.\u201d Id. This principle is particularly important here,\nfor State Petitioners\u2019 asserted fear of global warming stands in\nstark contrast to the position they took throughout this litigation.\nIn an earlier brief, for example, they characterized the\nEndangerment Finding as \u201ca subjective conviction\u201d State Pet\u2019rs\u2019\nEndangerment Br. 19, \u201csupported by highly uncertain climate\nforecasts,\u201d id. at 18, and \u201coffer[ing] no criteria for determining\na harmful, as opposed to a safe, climate,\u201d id. at 17. Given this,\n\f                               81\n\nEPA could not possibly have anticipated that State Petitioners,\nabruptly donning what they themselves call \u201can\nenvironmentalist hat,\u201d State Pet\u2019rs\u2019 Timing & Tailoring Reply\nBr. 4, would assert that global warming causes them concrete\nand particularized harm.\n\n     In any event, State Petitioners fail to cite any record\nevidence to suggest that they are adversely affected by global\nclimate change. This is in stark contrast to the evidence put\nforward in Massachusetts v. EPA, where the Commonwealth\nsubmitted unchallenged affidavits and declarations showing that\n1) rising sea tides due to global warming had \u201calready begun to\nswallow Massachusetts\u2019 coastal land,\u201d and 2) \u201c[t]he severity of\nthat injury will only increase over the course of the next\ncentury.\u201d Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. at 522\u201323. These\nspecific, factual submissions were key to the standing analysis\nin Massachusetts v. EPA: the Court held that \u201cpetitioners\u2019\nsubmissions as they pertain to Massachusetts have satisfied the\nmost demanding standards of the adversarial process.\u201d Id. at 521\n(emphasis added). It is true, as State Petitioners emphasize, that\nthe Supreme Court held that states are \u201centitled to special\nsolicitude in our standing analysis.\u201d Id. at 522. But nothing in\nthe Court\u2019s opinion remotely suggests that states are somehow\nexempt from the burden of establishing a concrete and\nparticularized injury in fact. State Petitioners, like Industry\nPetitioners, failed to do so here. We shall thus dismiss all\nchallenges to the Timing and Tailoring Rules for lack of\njurisdiction.\n\n                              VII.\n\n     Following promulgation of the Timing and Tailoring Rules,\nEPA issued a series of rules ordering states to revise their PSD\nState Implementation Plans (SIPs) to accommodate greenhouse\ngas regulation. See Action to Ensure Authority to Issue Permits\n\f                               82\n\nUnder the Prevention of Significant Deterioration Program to\nSources of Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Finding of Substantial\nInadequacy and SIP Call, 75 Fed. Reg. 53,892 (Sept. 2, 2010),\n75 Fed.

Reg.\n81,874 (Dec. 29, 2010). Industry Petitioners present several\nchallenges to these SIP-related rules. But our review in this case\nis limited to four EPA decisions: the Endangerment Finding, the\nTailpipe Rule, and the Timing and Tailoring Rules. We thus lack\njurisdiction over the SIP-related rules. Moreover, challenges to\nthese rules are currently pending in at least two separate cases\nbefore this court. See Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA, No.\n11-1037 (consolidating various challenges); Texas v. EPA, No.\n10-1425 (challenge brought by Texas). We decline Industry\nPetitioners\u2019 invitation to rule on the merits of cases which are\nproperly before different panels.\n\n\n                              VIII.\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, we dismiss all petitions for\nreview of the Timing and Tailoring Rules, and deny the\nremainder of the petitions.\n                                                    So ordered.\n\f"
