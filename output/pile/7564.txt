    "text": "Search Results for: jedi training academy\n\nPlease take note: The Jedi Training Academy has changed and this is no longer the process for getting to participate in the show. We have a new post coming soon. Check back at this link for more details very soon. Thanks!\n\n\u2013 Lisa, March 9, 2016\n\nThe Jedi Training Academy, held at the Tomorrowland Terrace stage, is the ultimate Star Wars fantasy come true for little boys who are yearning to become one with the force. Selected children get to learn the ways of the Jedi Knights and then test those skills against Darth Maul or Darth Vader. (Disneyland supplies the robes and lightsabers.)\n\nSorry dads. Jedi Training Academy is only for kiddos ages 4 to 12.\n\nIf you have a potential Padawan who really wants to train to be a Jedi Knight, it\u2019s important to know that there\u2019s a few tricks and tips you can use to get selected for the Jedi Training Academy. Here\u2019s the Babes in Disneyland \u201cHow to get selected for the Jedi Training Academy\u201d Guide.\n\nWear a Star Wars-themed shirt Kids in Star Wars shirts stand out to the Jedi selecting the participants. If your child doesn\u2019t have a Star Wars-themed shirt, wear a Disney one.\n\nMake a sign\nNow, I\u2019m not positive, but I don\u2019t think Disneyland really wants you to bring in big obnoxious signs. In fact, I saw them confiscate a poster board sign that said, \u201cI love Tiffany\u201d at the security check point this last weekend. With that in mind, I would recommend making a sign on a huge sheet of paper so that you can discretely bring it in in your bag, backpack, etc. Put something on your sign like, \u201cPlease pick Alex!\u201d or \u201cJake is the ultimate Jedi!\u201d. Folks with signs often get picked.\n\nEncourage your child to be enthusiastic!\nI know this goes without saying, but for some shy kids,\nthis isn\u2019t always easy. When the Jedi are looking for children to select, they are keeping an eye out for kids who are jumping up and down and excited to participate in the academy. My son was really enthusiastic to participate but isn\u2019t a natural born cheerleader. It would have been helpful if I had coached him a bit beforehand.\n\nEncourage everyone else in the family to be enthusiastic!\nWhen our youngest son became old enough to go through Jedi training, we brought lightsabers from home and my other two sons stood next to him, pointing at him with their lightsabers as our little guy jumped out and down. It worked.\n\nGet to the show early.\nFamilies start waiting for the show at least 30 minutes before show time. On really busy days, you may need to get there 45 minutes to an hour before show time. Encourage your child to sit close to the front of the selection area. (The sections are marked by tape on the ground.)\n\nPrepare your child for what to expect.\nIf you have never taken your child to see the show, it\u2019s a good idea that they see the show ahead of time so they know what to expect. Guests can watch the show from the Tomorrowland Terrace dining area. We love eating lunch and watching the show; it\u2019s really great family time. If you want your child to see the show before your visit, you can check out my son below.\n\nIf your kiddos hit it really lucky, they may even get selected to Force Push the Storm Troopers. As luck would have it, TWO of my three kids have gotten to Force Push. What luck! Watch Darth Vader in the video below very carefully. If you are a Star Wars fan, you will definitely laugh.Kids who participate in the Jedi Training Academy feel a huge sense of accomplishment afterward. It is truly an amazing opportunity.\n\nOne thing I would like to point out that I neglected to mention when this article was first published, was the fact that it is really important for families (kids and parents) to be courteous when vying for their child\u2019s place among the Padawans. Not all children (and their parents) are as aggressive and a reader recently reported her son was practically trampled by another family. Some kids are shy and some kids may have sensory or socialization limitations that may make it tougher for them to show the enthusiasm others. It is important to be careful to respect those kids\u2019 and their right to try and get a spot too.Do you have an additional tip for getting selected at the Jedi Training Academy? Share it below or on our Facebook page!\n\nSeveral weeks ago, my family and I spent the day at Disneyland. My four-year-old is a huge Star Wars fan, and he made the decision before we left the house that he had enough courage to finally try for a spot in the Jedi Training Academy. Up until this point, he refused to even sit at a table close to the training academy, yet now he felt like he was ready.\n\nIf you aren\u2019t in the Jedi Training Academy-know, the academy is an opportunity for children\u2013boys and girls\u2013to train with real Jedis and learn how to battle against well-known foes from the dark side, Darth Vader and Darth Maul. These characters are as real as they get. There\u2019s nothing more menacing as the image of Darth Vader coming up from under ground on the Tomorrowland Terrace stage amidst a cloud of eerie smoke with John Williams\u2019 famous Star Wars theme enveloping the eager crowd.\n\nPaying close attention to\nthe Jedis.\n\nMy four year old is not the most bravest child. In fact, he is very shy and very nervous when it comes to new experiences. He refuses to sit on Santa\u2019s lap and had a really hard time even telling Mrs. Claus what he wanted for Christmas as she helped him decorate cookies at the Disneyland blogger holiday party. He is one of those overly cautious children who doesn\u2019t like to take risks. He doesn\u2019t jump off of jungle gyms or make a scene when he is playing with his friends at the park.\n\nWith a bit of fear on his face, he sat patiently waiting for the Jedi Training Academy to begin \u2013not up at a table in the Tomorrowland Terrace dining area but the \u201cbull pen\u201d from which they select the children who will particpate and fight the dark side.\nAfter being chosen, my brave boy mustered up all of his courage and donned his Jedi robe, he was handed his light saber. The lesson was on and the \u201cbattles\u201d against the dark side were underway.\n\nFighting Darth Maul.\n\nI\u2019m guessing that Darth Maul\u2019s face was a bit\nscary for A to handle, but he stood strong\nagainst the dark side and prevailed.\n\nHere is a video of my son\u2019s experience.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if A\u2019s smile is\nthat of happiness, relief,\nor a little bit of both.\n\nI couldn\u2019t be more proud of how my little man stepped out of his comfort zone. I know he was scared to death, but he did it. I have a lot to learn from him. I really need to step out of my comfort zone every once in a while, no matter how nervous I might be.\n\nThe Jedi Training: Trials of the Temple, held at the Tomorrowland Terrace stage, is the ultimate Star Wars fantasy come true for little boys who are yearning to become one with the Force. (The show is formerly known as the \u201cJedi Training Academy.\u201d) Selected children get to learn the ways of the Jedi Knights and then test those skills against Darth Vader and the Seventh Sister. (Disneyland supplies the robes and lightsabers.) Sorry dads. Jedi Training is only for kiddos ages 4 to 12.\n\nIf you have visited Disneyland in previous years, you may be accustomed to the old way Padawans are selected to participate in the experience. Guests used to wait at the stage area and Jedi would select those they felt were strong with the Force. While this built up great excitement and crowds for the shows, Disney now uses a sign-up system for training participation. Here\u2019s what you need to do:\n\nAs soon as you arrive in Disneyland Park the morning of your visit, go straight over to the Tomorrowland Expo (formerly known as the \u201cInnoventions\u201d building). Do NOT go inside of the building. Instead go all the way around to the far left side of the building (near Autopia). There you will see a line of anxious parents and children waiting to get on the list for one of the day\u2019s shows. Jedi signing children up for the shows will likely try to fill shows in order, but you can request a later show. Cast Members will man the sign-up area until the shows are full and will be at the area prior to each show time to corral all of the Padawans before the shows and fill any no-show with those on the waiting list.\n\nIf it is raining or looks like rain\u2026 or has been raining and looks like it is going to clear up, still run over to the sign-ups. We attended the park on a day in which it had rained all night. We showed up just as they decided to resume having shows that day and got in to the first show of the day, which was less than 15 minutes away!\n\nThe child who will be participating must be present at the time of the sign up. We all love the idea of running into the park while the kids may be still nestled in their beds back at the hotel, but that\u2019s a n0-go. The kids must be present.\n\nIf you don\u2019t get into a show, ask to be put on a wait list.\n\nOr in simpler terms:\n\nIf you are able to get a spot in one of the shows (and they fill up quickly), here are a few tips for making it a time your family won\u2019t forget:\n\nPrepare your child for what to expect: If you have never taken your child to see the show, it\u2019s a good idea that they see the show ahead of time so they know what to expect\u2013especially if your child is shy, a little scared of Star Wars characters, doesn\u2019t like costumed characters\u2026 you get what I mean. Guests can watch the show from the Tomorrowland Terrace dining area. We love eating lunch and watching the show; it\u2019s really great family time. If you want your child to see the show before your visit, you can check out highlights from the training show two of my boys participated in.\n\nKeep it safe: Be sure that your child is wearing \u201csafe\u201d shoes \u2013 no shoes with wheels, etc. Shoes with wheels are not permitted.\n\nKeep that camera rolling: I would recommend families stay close by their kiddos, sitting on the ground by the participants. (There is a clearly marked area on the floor.) The show is long and we took a ton of video and photos. PhotoPass Cast Members also take pictures of all participants during the show. Because they photograph the show so often, they know how to get the very best shots. Definitely get a PhotoPass card before or after the show from one of the photographers. You will be amazed at some of the shots they get.\n\nKids who participate in the Jedi Training: Trials of the Temple feel a huge sense of accomplishment afterward, plus the get a special button! It is truly an amazing opportunity.\n\nAre you ready to \u201cHero-up\u201d at the Disneyland Resort this summer? Disney California Adventure Park is offering kids and families amazing ways to experience super hero life this summer. Here are six things you can do the summer to live your super hero dreams, plus what you MUST know so that your kiddo can train with the hero.\n\nDance like a hero at the \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy: Awesome Dance Off!\u201d\n\nStar-Lord fires up his old-school boom box to get a party started in \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy: Awesome Dance Off!\u201d Held in Hollywood Land, guests can show off their moves at this awesome rock \u2018n\u2019 roll bash and \u201cdance off\u201d and join teams with names that include \u201cTeam Pop,\u201d \u201cTeam Lock,\u201d \u201cTeam Rock\u201d and \u201cTeam Roll.\u201d This fun experience is hosted by none other than the Star-Lord himself.

The last will transport guests to a never-before-seen planet, a remote trading port and one of the last stops before wild space where Star Wars characters and their stories come to life. At Disneyland park, the land will be located in the Big Thunder Ranch area, inclusive of some backstage locations. For those of us who adore the Disneyland goats and the delicious food at Big Thunder BBQ, this is indeed theh little, gray rain cloud in this announcement.\n\n\u201cI am thrilled to announce the next chapter in the long and exciting history between Disney Parks and Star Wars,\u201d said Iger. \u201cWe are creating a jaw-dropping new world that represents our largest single themed land expansion ever. These new lands at Disneyland and Walt Disney World will transport guests to a whole new Star Wars planet, including an epic Star Wars adventure that puts you in the middle of a climactic battle between the First Order and the Resistance.\u201d\n\nConcept art of the new Star Wars land coming to DisneylandConcept art of the new Star Wars land coming to DisneylandConcept art for the new Star Wars Land coming to Disneyland.Concept art for the new Star Wars Land coming to Disneyland.\n\nThe Star Wars lands will have two signature attractions: one with a thrilling battle experience and another that puts guests behind the controls of one of the most recognizable ships in the galaxy, the Millennium Falcon, as they take on a customized secret mission.\n\nImages courtesy of Disney Parks and Resorts.\n\nIt will likely take years to develop and build these exciting new lands.

For the sake of this post, we are focusing on what will be happening at Disneyland.\n\nStar Tours \u2013 The Adventures Continue \u2013 Later this year, Star Tours will include a new adventure featuring locations and characters from the upcoming film, Star Wars: The Force Awakens, giving guests a new adventure in the Star Wars galaxy.\n\nJedi Training Academy \u2014 Although I am not sure how you can possibly improve on something so incredibly perfect, Jedi Training Academy will be reimagined with a new experience that includes new characters and a new villain to battle from the popular Disney XD series \u201cStar Wars Rebels.\u201d\n\nStar Wars Launch Bay \u2013 This interactive experience will take guests into the upcoming film, Star Wars: The Force Awakens, with special exhibits and peeks behind-the-scenes, including opportunities to visit with new and favorite Star Wars characters, special merchandise and food offerings.
