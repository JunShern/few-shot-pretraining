    "text": "Forty kilometres west of Australia's hottest town of Marble Bar is the North Pole... the North Pole Dome to be precise.\n\nIt's a rocky area that attracts scientists and geologists from around the world as they search not only for ancient rocks but early forms of life on Earth. Stromatolites and micobacteria fossils have been found, but a more recent discovery is even more exciting.\n\nDr David Wacey of University of West Australia is part of an international team that's found an ecosystem of single celled bacteria that has pushed back the age of life to 3.5 billion years old.\n\n\"What we've found may be the earliest evidence of life on earth,\" Dr Wacey says.\n\n\"It's hard to get your head around that it's 3.5 billion years old. It's just a crazy number.\"\n\nThe discovery is also helpful to the search for life on other planets, because the traces left by these primitive cells can be seen with the naked eye. Thus the Mars Rover for example could send back pictures of the ecosystem which could be compared to the microbial ecosystem found in the Pilbara.\n\nDr Wacey says the world was a tough place to survive in, no oxygen, lots of methane, and oceans at 70 degrees."
