    "text": "Wenger you wily old dog you.\n\nThis is as much a Wenger loving post as it is a Cesc one. Rumours are rife regarding the return of Cesc to Arsenal and pretty much all Gooners agree that this would be a good thing.\n\nI do not claim to know the details of Fabregas\u2019 transfer to Barcelona and don\u2019t want to get into the \u201che forced his way out\u201d stuff. From where I was sat all I could see was a player desperate to go to one team and one team only. As a business person, in fact just as an ordinary bloke, I can tell you that this put us in a very weak negotiation position.\n\nFor Arsenal to sell their crown jewel for \u00a335m in a market that sees Carroll go for the same was a bitter pill for me to swallow. This and only this is/was my gripe with Cesc but it wasn\u2019t only with Cesc; it was with Arsenal too. I felt they could have put a stick in the ground and said \u00a350m or no deal but they didn\u2019t. That\u2019s over and done with now and we\u2019ve moved on as such.\n\nSo, back in the present day and after almost a week of some Gooners tearing their hair out and raising their own blood pressure at the thought of Cesc going to United, news has \u201cbroken\u201d that Arsenal have first refusal etc.\n\nCast your memories back to the time we sold Cesc and try to remember the sneers directed at Ars\u00e8ne and the board for dragging their heels over Cesc.\n\n\u201cThey knew he was going so why wait so long to buy a replacement\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, they needed to make sure he was sold first, we can\u2019t afford to buy players we don\u2019t need\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah but we knew he was going to go so why take so long over the negotiations\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, Wenger insisted on a buyback clause\u201d\n\n\u201cBuyback clause, what a waste of time, Cesc is never coming back here\u201d.\n\nRemember that? I do. At the time I wasn\u2019t concerned about buyback clauses et al. I was concerned about selling the best midfielder of his generation for what I considered to be a pittance. How wrong I was, how foolish I was to question our savant manager.\n\nEpictetus once said:\n\nIf you want to improve, be content to be thought foolish and stupid.\n\nMost of us know Wenger fell on his sword for Arsenal a long time ago to aid our transition to our state-of-the-art new home. Now it seems, in the search for improvements, he was willing to paint himself the fool for us too.\n\nPutting all of the reported clauses into the Fabregas sale may yet turn out to be Wenger\u2019s greatest ever transfer deal.\n\nThe reports suggest Arsenal have not only a first-refusal clause but a 50% sell on clause and a buyback clause of \u00a320-25m. If that is true then that is an amazing piece of business and something no other deal can match or will be able to match in the future, you can bet on that and get matched free bets to boot.\n\nWhen Arsenal sold Fabregas and even during the 2 year tap up by Barcelona I repeatedly said, as did many others, Fabregas would not \u201cfit\u201d at Barcelona and he was better off waiting a few more years. I felt that Barca didn\u2019t need him and he was only being pursued because they wanted a marquee signing and he fit the bill with an added tick because of his birthplace.\n\nWenger clearly saw the same thing and probably a little bit more. Did he see Cesc struggling to be the starter he was for Arsenal and maybe wanting a move back home (his real home) just as Arsenal have the cash to do so? I wouldn\u2019t put it past him.\n\nWe all know that Cesc wanted to play for Barcelona and especially for Pep Guardiola and he got his wish. He\u2019s had his fill now so maybe it\u2019s time to come back to Arsenal.\n\nWhat is so amazing about the potential return of Cesc is that he fits almost every bill that Arsenal need.\n\nHe is world-class \u2013 TICK \u2013 fans appeased\n\nHe is creative \u2013 TICK \u2013 the team needs more creativity\n\nHe fits at Arsenal \u2013 TICK \u2013 he isn\u2019t a gamble\n\nHe is cheap \u2013 TICK \u2013 Coffers remain mostly full\n\nCheap might seem a little off but if the reports are true then he would be cheap. If Arsenal have a 50% sell on clause AND a buyback clause of \u00a320-25m AND first-refusal then any club wishing to purchase Cesc would require a bid of \u00a340-50m just to match Arsenal. If Arsenal were willing to go up to the price we sold him for then other clubs would need to bid a whopping \u00a370m just to match us AND we\u2019d get half of that fee if we decided to step aside.\n\nI\u2019m sceptical that all of those clauses exist together but even individually they are potent enough for the pendulum of favour to swing in our direction.\n\nThere are other factors to consider too. Barcelona owes Arsenal money for Cesc in add-ons for winning trophies as well as owing us money on the Song transfer and his add-ons too. There is also the will of the management at Barcelona to consider too. Is Cesc needed at Barcelona? Is he wanted? Maybe, maybe not but according to those who know more about Barcelona than I, they are looking to make some purchases this summer and also want to trim the squad a bit.\n\nThe return of Cesc doesn\u2019t seem so far-fetched now and coincides amazingly well with our new-found financial prowess. If it happens and under the circumstances the reports claim it could happen then all we can do is stand up and applaud the mighty Wenger.\n\nEven if he doesn\u2019t come back it seems Arsenal will benefit from it regardless.\n\nArs\u00e8ne, you wily old dog you.\n\nThanks for reading!
