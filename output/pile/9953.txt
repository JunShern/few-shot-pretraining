Go Shellfishing\n\nHood Canal is known for its oysters and clams. Are there low tides during your stay? Gathering clams and oysters is only practical on most beaches during the daytime on tides lower than 2 feet, although minus tides are better. If you\u2019d like to try shellfishing, bring old tennis shoes, rubber boots, or aqua socks to wear on the beach. Our beaches are full of oysters, the shells are razor sharp and can easily cut, so be careful. Bring a bucket and a rake to get clams. On most beaches you can just rake down to the clams since they are close to the surface. Be sure to fill in your holes. Bring an oyster shucking knife and a pair of gloves. Oysters shells are very sharp so you will want to wear gloves when you open them with a knife. An oyster knife is much different than a regular knife so if you love to eat oysters be sure to bring one along. Bring beach towels or old towels. The towels in the houses are for bathing and not the beach. Don\u2019t forget your shellfish license. You can buy them at the Brinnon store. You can buy an annual license or a 1-3 day license. Everyone has to have one even if you are on private property.List of BeachesRules and LimitsClam and Oyster season at Public BeachesDaytime low tidesAbout our local oysters and clams\n\nIf you\u2019d rather just buy some shellfish, you can get them at Taylor Shellfish in Shelton or Hama Hama in Lilliwaup. They often have oysters and clams in Quilcene at Twana Roadhouse or Quilcene Village store. The vacation home kitchens are stocked with cookware and utensils for preparing your meals. Some kitchens will have seasonings, but you should bring your favorites with you. Prepare your dinner then sit outside with your bounty and a beverage and take in the waterfront view, seals, eagles, and the changing tide.\n\n3.Go Hiking\n\nExperience Forest fresh air, vista views from the olympic mountain trails overlooking Hood Canal. Its a hikers paradise with easy to difficult trails to explore for all ages. Bring your camera and check out these local classic waterfall hikes: Rocky Brook Falls, Falls View, and Murhut Falls or check out the Hood Canal Hiking guide from Washington Trails Association.\n\n4. Go Kayaking\n\nPopular launch sites include Pt Whitney, Pleasant Harbor, Seal Rock Campground, Yelviks Boat ramp, Dosewallips State Park, and Triton Cove. Kayak Brinnon provides kayak rentals and tours from Yelviks beach in Brinnon and will deliver kayaks to locations between Quilcene and Potlatch. There is plenty of sealife to view. And, often our local elk herd are present near Dosewallips State Park.\n\n6. View Wildlife\n\nThere are plenty of birds that frequent the tidelands around Hood Canal and along the way on your hikes in Olympic National Forest. Stop off at one of the visitor centers in Quilcene, Brinnon, or Hoodsport to pick up a bird guide. They are an excellent stop for hiking maps and area information. Deer are numerous and Elk can be seen around the Dosewallips State Park. Wildlife information from the Department of Fish and Wildlife can be found Here.\n\nShrimp Hood Canal\n\nIf you want to experience the best tasting shrimp of the Pacific Northwest, the spot shrimp from Hood Canal, you have two options. You can be adventurous and catch it yourself, or you can buy it.\n\nWhere to Buy Hood Canal Shrimp\n\nNormally the best place to get Hood Canal Shrimp is at the Brinnon Shrimpfest on Memorial Day weekend. Unfortunately, the Shrimpfest was called off this year due to lack of volunteers. Luckily YOU CAN BUY SPOT SHRIMP ON MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND \u2013 10 am to 4 pm Saturday, Sunday and Monday at the Brinnon Community Center located at 306144 Highway 101 in Brinnon, WA.\n\nMeanwhile, if you\u2019d like to try shrimping yourself, here are some tips:\n\nHow to Catch Hood Canal Shrimp\n\nBasically you need a boat, shrimp pots (see special pot requirements), weighted line and buoys, shellfish license, bait (usually fish flavored cat food), warm clothes, a sense of adventure and a bit of gold rush mentality. There are only four days of shrimping: May 5, 9, 12 and 23rd, 4 hours each day. See all the rules at the Washington Fish and Wildlife website here.\n\nYou can\u2019t put your pots in the water until 9 am and must have them out by 1 pm. People usually do two \u201cpulls\u201d. This prevents getting totally skunked if your first location is bad. It takes some skill to drop your pots and pull them. Why? With only a few hours of shrimp season, there are literally a hundred boats all crowded around the prime shrimping spots. Add windy weather, and tide movement and you have mayhem, tangled line, capsizes, lost pots and stinky boats with plenty of shrimp guts all around.\nThe brave will do it. The adventurers. For the rest of us, thank goodness for the sale of shrimp.\n\nTo get an idea of why shrimping is not for the faint of heart, we took a recent poll of the shrimping experts from Hood Canal who revealed their sage advice. And admittedly, things they had learned from experience\u2026\n\nTiming\n\nDon\u2019t show up at the boat launch at 8:30 am on shrimp day and expect to get out on the water before 9. There will be people lined up at \u201czero dark thirty\u201d to get their boat in the water and it will be backed up to Canada. All of the greats spots will be taken and you will then be a jerk trying to drop your line next to theirs especially if its windy or a fast moving tide. Then, expect a repeat shortly after 1 pm as the flotilla returns to the boat launch. Many of them having consumed their own personal \u201canti-freeze\u201d making backing up a trailer a real spectacle.\n\nLocation Location Location\n\nThe shrimp like to hang out near the bottom \u2013 usually 200 to 300 feet deep! That is a lot of line to pull up. Either have a \u201cpot puller\u201d or Arnold Schwarzeneger in your boat to make it happen. If you have a gas powered pot puller, don\u2019t forget to put gas in it. Its best to invest in a depth-finder so that you don\u2019t exceed the length of your line. See Pot Problems below.\n\nClothing and Hygiene\n\nYou will get wet and stinky. Even if it is not foggy or misty, there will likely be some current and wind and some splashing as you drop and pick up pots. So its nice to wear extra waterproof layers to keep dry and warm. Also there is the \u201chead popping blow back.\u201d Shrimp guts sometimes squirt all over as you extract their heads. Some clothing never gets the smell out. So don\u2019t wear your good stuff. A thermos of nice hot coffee to keep you warm you say? Just remember, if you don\u2019t have a bathroom on board your boat, you might want to curtail your coffee intake or make it dependent on the amount of time you can make it back to the harbor and the bathroom.\n\nToo many Skippers, Not enough Deck Hands\n\nUsually pick the person that knows how to drive a boat in wind and current. This can change several times during the morning due to wind, currents, waves, boats and pots. And remember that Arnold is busy.\n\nYou get my drift? and other pot problems\n\nYou put your name and address on your buoy and made sure it is a yellow buoy (as required), but you can\u2019t find your pot. Many attach unique markers to their buoys like helium balloons, styrofoam objects, skull and crossbones, shiny streamers, underwear and other creative ideas. Oh, and don\u2019t forget to attach the buoy to your pot as you expertly fling the pot into the water. If you remembered to bring a depth-finder you could have set a GPS waypoint to where you dropped your pot. If you still can\u2019t find your pot by 1 pm, you\u2019ll have to wait until the next low tide AND you have to call Fish and Wildlife and report a lost pot. This may help if they find it first, or if they find someone else who found it first. See WDFW rules \u201cDo not attempt to salvage lost gear without getting a permit\u201d website link. Pots have been recovered with a grappling hook. And no, you can\u2019t keep the shrimp that\u2019s still in there.\n\nDon\u2019t get out of line\n\nDon\u2019t miss out on most of the shrimp because your line wasn\u2019t properly stored from last time you went shrimping. Untangling line in full sight of all the other shrimpers is a shattering shameful experience and will cost you precious time. Or your line gets caught in someones boat propeller because you did not use weighted line. This also costs the other person precious time and you don\u2019t want to go there.\n\nYay Shrimp!\n\nYou pull your pot and have a million shrimp! Make sure to bring a separate bucket for each person with a license. Put a maximum of 80 per bucket. Also bring an extra bucket for popping their heads (the shrimp). Its ok to pop heads before you get back to the harbor. Most do and then dump the heads on their way back. Just make sure its NOT THE TAILS YOU ARE DUMPING OUT (looks of horror).\n\nFishing reports\n\nMay 5th reports say most people got their limits, but there were more people shrimping than ever before. May 9th was very stormy and much less people went out in the 12+ mph wind. Many of those that did go out gave up due to problems pulling pots and tangles due to weather. May 12th was great weather and lots of shrimp. May 23rd the weather is looking good. Stay tuned for more information.\n\nShellfishing Hood Canal\n\nSpring sun, Hood Canal and daytime low tides. A recipe for a fine getaway to Hood Canal with the main course being Shellfish, of course. The warmer temperatures mean the snow levels go up, providing access to Hood Canal\u2019s finest mountain trails with outstanding vista views. The melting snow rushes down rivers and supercharges the waterfall hikes. The Washington state flower, the rhododendron, provides a rosey pink background and a feast for your eyes.\n\nBut more about Hood Canal Shellfish. Washington shellfish are sought by consumers around the world and are a well-deserved source of pride for local growers. Shellfish are also a key part of our marine ecosystems, providing habitat and helping filter and cleanse water. For all of these reasons, shellfish are an extraordinary resource for Washington state to exclaim. Hood Canal is famous for its oysters and manilla clams which are easy to get at low tide. Most years we start on Easter with our traditional Easter egg and clam hunt. This year, daytime low tides continue through April 6th, then again 16th-22nd. Coinciding with Washington Shellfish week April 15th \u2013 21st and culminating with the Hood Canal Hama Hama Oyster rama on the 21st. Buy your shellfish license, check out the Public Beaches or stay at a waterfront vacation rental with your own beach. If shellfish hunting isn\u2019t your thing, you can always buy your seafood at Hama Hama or Taylor Shellfish farm. Or dine your way around the Olympic Peninsula following the OlympicCulinaryLoop which includes Olympic Peninsula Wineries, Breweries and Distilleries.\n\nThere will be some low tides on Hood Canal in late March. Low enough to gather oysters and clams!Here is a link to public beaches. And take advantage of our 3 for 2 special! Stay 2 nights and get the 3rd night free for stays thru March 31st."
