    "text": "Russia's Sergey Lavrov is not one foreign minister known to mince his words. Just earlier today, 24 hours after a Russian plane was brought down by the country whose president three years ago said \"a short-term border violation can never be a pretext for an attack\", had this to say: \"We have serious doubts this was an unintended incident and believe this is a planned provocation\" by Turkey.\n\nBut even that was tame compared to what Lavrov said to his Turkish counterparty Mevlut Cavusoglu earlier today during a phone call between the two (Lavrov who was supposed to travel to Turkey has since canceled such plans).\n\nAs Sputnik transcribes, according to a press release from Russia\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Lavrov pointed out that, \"by shooting down a Russian plane on a counter-terrorist mission of the Russian Aerospace Force in Syria, and one that did not violate Turkey\u2019s airspace, the Turkish government has in effect sided with ISIS.\"\n\nIt was in this context when Lavrov added that \"Turkey\u2019s actions appear premeditated, planned, and undertaken with a specific objective.\"\n\nMore importantly, Lavrov pointed to Turkey\u2019s role in the propping up the terror network through the oil trade. Per the Russian statement:\n\n\"The Russian Minister reminded his counterpart about Turkey\u2019s involvement in the ISIS\u2019 illegal trade in oil, which is transported via the area where the Russian plane was shot down, and about the terrorist infrastructure, arms and munitions depots and control centers that are also located there.\"\n\nOthers reaffirmed Lavrov's stance, such as retired French General Dominique Trinquand, who said that \"Turkey is either not fighting ISIL at all or very little, and does not interfere with different types of smuggling that takes place on its border, be it oil, phosphate, cotton or people,\" he said.\n\nThe reason we find this line of questioning fascinating is that just last week in the aftermath of the French terror attack but long before the Turkish downing of the Russian jet, we wrote about \"The Most Important Question About ISIS That Nobody Is Asking\" in which we asked who is the one \"breaching every known law of funding terrorism when buying ISIS crude, almost certainly with the tacit approval by various \"western alliance\" governments, and why is it that these governments have allowed said middleman to continue funding ISIS for as long as it has?\"\n\nPrecisely one week later, in even more tragic circumstances, suddenly everyone is asking this question.\n\nAnd while we patiently dig to find who the on and offshore \"commodity trading\" middleman are, who cart away ISIS oil to European and other international markets in exchange for hundreds of millions of dollars, one name keeps popping up as the primary culprit of regional demand for the Islamic State's \"terrorist oil\" - that of Turkish president Recep Erdogan's son: Bilal Erdogan.\n\nHis very brief bio:\n\nNecmettin Bilal Erdogan, commonly known as Bilal Erdogan (born 23 April 1980) is the third child of Recep Tayyip Erdo?an, the current President of Turkey. After graduating from Kartal Imam Hatip High School in 1999, Bilal Erdogan moved to the US for undergraduate education. He also earned a Masters Degree in John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University in 2004. After graduation, he served in the World Bank as intern for a while. He returned Turkey in 2006 and started to his business life. Bilal Erdogan is one of the three equal shareholders of \"BMZ Group Denizcilik \", a marine transportation corporation.\n\nHere is a recent picture of Bilal, shown in a photo from a Turkish 2014 article, which \"asked why his ships are now in Syria\":\n\nIn the next few days, we will present a full breakdown of Bilal's various business ventures, starting with his BMZ Group which is the name implicated most often in the smuggling of illegal Iraqi and Islamic State through to the western supply chain, but for now here is a brief, if very disturbing snapshot, of both father and son Erdogan by F. William Engdahl, one which should make everyone ask whether the son of Turkey's president (and thus, the father) is the silent mastermind who has been responsible for converting millions of barrels of Syrian Oil into hundreds of millions of dollars of Islamic State revenue.\n\nBy F. William Engdahl, posted originally in New Eastern Outlook:\n\nErdogan's Dirth Dangerous ISIS Games\n\nMore and more details are coming to light revealing that the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, variously known as ISIS, IS or Daesh, is being fed and kept alive by Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Turkish President and by his Turkish intelligence service, including MIT, the Turkish CIA. Turkey, as a result of Erdogan\u2019s pursuit of what some call a Neo-Ottoman Empire fantasies that stretch all the way to China, Syria and Iraq, threatens not only to destroy Turkey but much of the Middle East if he continues on his present path.\n\nIn October 2014 US Vice President Joe Biden told a Harvard gathering that Erdogan\u2019s regime was backing ISIS with \u201chundreds of millions of dollars and thousands of tons of weapons\u2026\u201d Biden later apologized clearly for tactical reasons to get Erdo?an\u2019s permission to use Turkey\u2019s Incirlik Air Base for airstrikes against ISIS in Syria, but the dimensions of Erdogan\u2019s backing for ISIS since revealed is far, far more than Biden hinted.\n\nISIS militants were trained by US, Israeli and now it emerges, by Turkish special forces at secret bases in Konya Province inside the Turkish border to Syria, over the past three years. Erdo?an\u2019s involvement in ISIS goes much deeper. At a time when Washington, Saudi Arabia and even Qatar appear to have cut off their support for ISIS, they remaining amazingly durable. The reason appears to be the scale of the backing from Erdo?an and his fellow neo-Ottoman Sunni Islam Prime Minister, Ahmet Davuto?lu.\n\nNice Family Business\n\nThe prime source of money feeding ISIS these days is sale of Iraqi oil from the Mosul region oilfields where they maintain a stronghold. The son of Erdogan it seems is the man who makes the export sales of ISIS-controlled oil possible.\n\nBilal Erdo?an owns several maritime companies. He has allegedly signed contracts with European operating companies to carry Iraqi stolen oil to different Asian countries. The Turkish government buys Iraqi plundered oil which is being produced from the Iraqi seized oil wells. Bilal Erdogan\u2019s maritime companies own special wharfs in Beirut and Ceyhan ports that are transporting ISIS\u2019 smuggled crude oil in Japan-bound oil tankers.\n\nG\u00fcrsel Tekin vice-president of the Turkish Republican Peoples\u2019 Party, CHP, declared in a recent Turkish media interview, \u201cPresident Erdogan claims that according to international transportation conventions there is no legal infraction concerning Bilal\u2019s illicit activities and his son is doing an ordinary business with the registered Japanese companies, but in fact Bilal Erdo?an is up to his neck in complicity with terrorism, but as long as his father holds office he will be immune from any judicial prosecution.\u201d Tekin adds that Bilal\u2019s maritime company doing the oil trades for ISIS, BMZ Ltd, is \u201ca family business and president Erdogan\u2019s close relatives hold shares in BMZ and they misused public funds and took illicit loans from Turkish banks.\u201d\n\nIn addition to son Bilal\u2019s illegal and lucrative oil trading for ISIS, S\u00fcmeyye Erdogan, the daughter of the Turkish President apparently runs a secret hospital camp inside Turkey just over the Syrian border where Turkish army trucks daily being in scores of wounded ISIS Jihadists to be patched up and sent back to wage the bloody Jihad in Syria, according to the testimony of a nurse who was recruited to work there until it was discovered she was a member of the Alawite branch of Islam, the same as Syrian President Bashar al-Assad who Erdogan seems hell-bent on toppling.\n\nTurkish citizen Ramazan Bagol, captured this month by Kurdish People\u2019s Defence Units,YPG, as he attempted to join ISIS from Konya province, told his captors that said he was sent to ISIS by the \u2018Ismailia Sect,\u2019 a strict Turkish Islam sect reported to be tied to Recep Erdogan. Baol said the sect recruits members and provides logistic support to the radical Islamist organization. He added that the Sect gives jihad training in neighborhoods of Konya and sends those trained here to join ISIS gangs in Syria.\n\nAccording to French geopolitical analyst, Thierry Meyssan, Recep Erdogan \u201corganised the pillage of Syria, dismantled all the factories in Aleppo, the economic capital, and stole the machine-tools. Similarly, he organised the theft of archeological treasures and set up an international market in Antioch\u2026with the help of General Beno\u00eet Puga, Chief of Staff for the Elys\u00e9e, he organised a false-flag operation intended to provoke the launching of a war by the Atlantic Alliance \u2013 the chemical bombing of la Ghoutta in Damascus, in August 2013. \u201c\n\nMeyssan claims that the Syria strategy of Erdo?an was initially secretly developed in coordination with former French Foreign Minister Alain Jupp\u00e9 and Erdogan\u2019s then Foreign Minister Ahmet Davuto?lu, in 2011, after Juppe won a hesitant Erdogan to the idea of supporting the attack on traditional Turkish ally Syria in return for a promise of French support for Turkish membership in the EU. France later backed out, leaving Erdogan to continue the Syrian bloodbath largely on his own using ISIS.\n\nGen. John R. Allen, an opponent of Obama\u2019s Iran peace strategy, now US diplomatic envoy coordinating the coalition against the Islamic State, exceeded his authorized role after meeting with Erdogan and \u201cpromised to create a \"no-fly zone\" ninety miles wide, over Syrian territory, along the whole border with Turkey, supposedly intended to help Syrian refugees fleeing from their government, but in reality to apply the \"Jupp\u00e9-Wright plan\". The Turkish Prime Minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, revealed US support for the project on the TV channel A Haber by launching a bombing raid against the PKK.\u201d Meyssan adds.\n\nThere are never winners in war and Erdogan\u2019s war against Syria\u2019s Assad demonstrates that in bold. Turkey and the world deserve better. Ahmet Davutoglu\u2019s famous \u201cZero Problems With Neighbors\u201d foreign policy has been turned into massive problems with all neighbors due to the foolish ambitions of Erdogan and his gang."
