The only catch? It's all Cthulhu, baby.\n\nThere is only one name synonymous with cosmic horror: H.P. Lovecraft. There are only a few dudes who know how to read and are willing to do it in front of a live audience ... uncloaked. Without a stitch. Au Naturel.\n\nJust in time for Valentine's Day, Ham Pants Productions and Stage Werx Theatre are proud to present: Naked Dudes Reading Lovecraft. On February 13, 2013 at 8:00 pm, more than a handful of dudes will read a handful of Lovecraft, in the altogether. This is the closest some of us will get to romance this Valentines day.\n\nHey, if you're going to be alone on Valentine's Day, you might as well spend it with a few tentacle monsters, right? And I'm sure the Lovecraft reading will be good, too. The event's site is here, should you need it."
