Something like\ncat input.txt | while read -r a; do sed -i 's/$a/.jpg/g' wordpress.sql; done \n\nAny suggestions? Even for the RegEx.\n\nA:\n\nsed is for simple substitutions on individual lines, that is all, and you should never write a shell loop just to manipulate text, see http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/169716/why-is-using-a-shell-loop-to-process-text-considered-bad-practice.\nTry this (uses GNU awk which I assume you have since you were using GNU sed):\nawk -i inplace 'NR==FNR { paths[$0]; next }\n{\n    for (path in paths) {\n        gsub(path,gensub(/png$/,\"jpg\",1,path))\n    }\n    print\n}\n' input.txt wordpress.sql\n\nIt has some caveats related to partial matching but no worse than if you were trying to use sed and easily fixable if there's a problem (unlike with sed).\n\n"
