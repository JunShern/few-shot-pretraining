    "text": "Search\n\nWow, that took a while. Sorry for the 12-month outage chaps. Contrary to reports in the media I have not hung up my chopsticks for good, I just couldn\u2019t locate my inner rant. I might well have left it in the back of a Hong Kong taxi to be honest. Well, now your friendly neighbourhood Noodle is back, with all the inevitability of an unloved season, and primed to explode over this city like hot porky broth on a ramen shop floor. (I\u2019m going to be doing some jokes).\n\nTo kick things off, though, I found this little gem lurking in the bottom of my tatty porcelain noodle bowl of fun. An interview with arch electro-plinky plonkers Metronomy from back in 2008 \u2013 ie before they was as famous as they is now \u2013 replete with original line-up and arguably better songs. Stay tuned for original content coming soon\u2026\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\n\nMetronomy is not a band to play by the rules. In fact, they don\u2019t even know where the rule book is. And if they found it, they\u2019d probably burn it, in a wooded area, next to a no-smoking sign. So it comes as no surprise to find these three deceptively well-spoken and civil young men having a cheeky fag in one of the numerous threadbare rooms inside Camden\u2019s Koko. It\u2019s a couple of hours before they\u2019re on; the nth date on their never-ending tour to promote their unique brand of electro plinky-plonk, perfect pop harmonies, falsetto choruses and affected, meticulously choreographed dance moves.\n\nHere at Canvas we don\u2019t rate the more obscure bands for the sake of their obscurity, but Metronomy are different, we\u2019ve decided; they pretty much provide our very own litmus test of friends and acquaintances. Heard of Metronomy? Yes? OK, thumbs up. Like them? Alright, you can be our friend for life. Which isn\u2019t actually to say that Metronomy are obscure \u2013 songwriter and band founder Joseph Mount has remixed everyone from Kate Nash to Goldfrapp.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice now because people are quite up for having their stuff remixed,\u201d he says. \u201cKD Lang wanted something quite radio-friendly, so I did what I thought was radio-friendly but it wasn\u2019t really what she expected. Taking entertaining risks is good fun, it\u2019s a nice way to while away a few hours.\u201d\n\nYou might have already come across Metronomy in broadsheet articles heralding the so-called Nu Rave scene alongside Late of the Pier and Does it Offend You, Yeah? among others \u2013 but it\u2019s about as cohesive a scene as anything invented by a Guardian journalist, ie not at all. \u201cI guess you have to expect that,\u201d muses Mount. \u201cBut it\u2019s actually quite nice now because we have people interviewing us and they\u2019re saying \u2018 we don\u2019t know how to describe your music\u2019.\u201d\n\nSo how do you describe Metronomy\u2019s music? According to the MySpace page, the band hail everyone from Bowie to The Ramones as an influence. In their own words though, they rate Usher and Timberlake for their unique credit-crunch defying dancing skills, Timbers coming in for special praise by virtue of being \u201clike Beatles-lite\u201d, according to Mount. A cross between the Beatles and Nirvana is how they\u2019d like to describe their own music though \u2013 ie a combination of Revolution # 9 and Polly, apparently. Hmmn, maybe you should just go out and buy a record for yourself, or even better, see them live \u2013 their unique stage show involves rather large push button lights slung from each band member\u2019s neck, being pushed on and off at regular intervals in time to the music, and statuesque posing behind their keyboards. If you\u2019re very lucky there\u2019ll also be a troupe of dancing girls behind doing a jig in time to the tunes. But don\u2019t let this put you off, there\u2019s a boyish playfulness \u2013 a knowing wink to the audience that this is all just a bit of a larf and not some art school pretentious wank \u2013 that means they can just about pull it off. But are they worried the gimmick will be a curse as more people discover \u201cthat band with the lights\u201d?.\n\n\u201cI went though the paranoia that maybe we should change this idea but actually it\u2019s brilliant \u2013 it\u2019s a strong look,\u201d says Mount. \u201cI\u2019d argue that there\u2019s not that many other bands that have something so visual linked to them. So some people may catch us at a festival and not know who we are but remember the show and then stumble across our music a few weeks later.\u201d\n\nThe music has evolved a lot since Mount wrote the first album in his bedroom \u2013 figuratively anyway. Recruiting school chums Oscar Cash and Gabriel Stebbing for the live shows has led to a more expansive, lyrical and, god forbid, radio-friendly sound. Tunes like Heartbreaker, Radio LADIO and Heart Rate Rapid featuring infectiously catchy choruses and little flourishes which marry perfectly to the band\u2019s cheeky on stage antics.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been quite a gap between the first album and this and it\u2019s been quite a natural progression, influenced by the fact that we\u2019ve been playing live and me realising what Oscar and Gabriel are capable of \u2026 and what they can\u2019t do,\u201d says Mount. \u201cWhen the first album was done, songs like Trick or Treatz were written by me but the reason I didn\u2019t sing on them was because I wasn\u2019t confident enough to sing like a girl \u2026 but that\u2019s all changed now.\u201d\n\nSo what\u2019s the ultimate goal for the band? Can they or do they want to reconcile their unique sound and growing band of followers with the mainstream and super stardom? Well, their aspirations are typically modest; Gabriel wants a Saturday morning kids TV slot, apparently, while Oscar would just like it \u201cif a few more people heard of us because we deserve it\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt would be a shame if we were dropped by our label because people didn\u2019t pick up on it quickly enough,\u201d adds Mount. \u201cIt would just be nice if more people got it, although we\u2019d have to do fucking badly to get dropped by our label.\u201d\n\nSo look out for the new album in September kids \u2013 \u201cdriving music\u201d perfect for 45 minutes in the car, according to Mount. Or better still, catch them at one of numerous London and festival appearances over the summer \u2013 you won\u2019t be disappointed, although they might be if you don\u2019t bother coming, and so will we. Not angry, just disappointed."
