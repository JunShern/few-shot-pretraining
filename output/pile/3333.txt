    "text": "Meet the Robinsons (video game)\n\nMeet the Robinsons refers to three different video games based on a film by the same name.\n\nConsole version\n\nStoryline\nThe game begins with Wilbur Robinson doing some time-traveling of his own, risking both his safety and the time stream in the process.  Despite his father's warning not to mess with the time machine while he's away on a business trip, Wilbur doesn't seem fazed.  Soon, the second time machine is stolen by the Bowler Hat Guy and Wilbur ends up following him into the past.  It is here where Wilbur accidentally knocks down Stanley and Lizzie, disrupting the time stream in the process. With their projects ruined and their dreams crushed, an alternate future develops.\n\nCarl immediately calls Wilbur back to the future, realizing that their world is now under the dangerous control of Emperor Stanley and Queen Lizzie.  It is up to Wilbur to fix the time stream before he can go back to pursue the Bowler Hat Guy, events which lead straight-up to Wilbur's entrance in the movie.\n\nGameplay\nThe game follows Wilbur through 40 missions and 6 different locales, a few of which are revisited in the movie.  Secret Blueprints allow the player to \"build\" different Cheats and Extras, using Cornelius Robinson's Transmogrifier.  This machine creates items using Base Components which Wilbur collects during his adventure. A Breakout like game called Chargeball is both featured in the game itself and as an extra gameplay option. Different Chargeball \"maps\" can be found throughout game and it is up to Wilbur to become the Chargeball champion.\n\nOriginal actors such as Wesley Singerman, Harland Williams, Adam West, Nicole Sullivan, and Stephen Anderson reprise their roles for the Robinson family, while Daniel Hansen (Lewis) doesn't appear in the game at all.\n\nThe locations in this game include: Ancient Egypt, the Robinsons' house, the Robinsons' basement, Joyce Williams Elementary School, the alternate future, Magma Industries, and Old Town.\n\nGame Boy Advance version\n\nStoryline\nAfter Lewis returns to the past and prepares for his new life, Wilbur arrives back home only to find that his house has been invaded by several hundred Mini-Doris hats. He learns that Mini-Doris, which Frannie's Frogs originally captured, has made its way to Robinson Industries to begin cloning herself. Wilbur travels back into the past in the hopes that Lewis will be able to help him again, an offer which Lewis is at first reluctant to take.\n\nGameplay\nExclusively developed for the Game Boy Advance, the Climax Entertainment game features a completely different storyline and uses a mix of side-scrolling, top-view, and flying levels (for the Time Machine) throughout.  Both Wilbur and Lewis are able to create and activate several different inventions by finding invention pieces throughout the levels. In addition, InventCo Egg-Timers and Gift Boxes are hidden throughout; collecting enough of these will unlock special \"Goodies\" on the main menu. In addition, a \"Battery\" meter serves as both a life gauge and a power gauge for the many different inventions.\n\nThe events of the game take place immediately after the movie, rather than before like in the Buena Vista Games version.  Inexplicably, this is also the only Meet the Robinsons game which features Lewis as a main playable character.  Due to the limitations of the Game Boy Advance, no voice-acting is featured.\n\nNintendo DS version\nThe Nintendo DS version is a third-person shooter with a simplified version of the console storyline, borrowing familiar game elements, such as the Dissembler and Charge Glove as well as adding exclusive ones. It follows the console version in four different worlds; Egypt, Lizzy, Stanley, and finally the Bowler Hat Guy's robotic hat- Doris, that ensures a final battle for the future. The Nintendo DS version also includes chargeball as well, just as the console version.\n\nReception\n\nResults of the game were average to mixed.\n\nCast\nDanny Cooksey as Emperor Stanley\nBill Farmer as Ice Cream Vendor\nParker Goris as Genetic Kid #4\nDon Hall as Uncle Gaston\nRobbie E. Harrison as Wilbur's Friends\nTracey Miller-Zarneke as Lizzy\nWesley Singerman as Wilbur Robinson\nAlex Brooklyn Stein as Girl\nNicole Sullivan as Franny Robinson\nAndre Ware as Chargeball Champion\nAdam West as Uncle Art\nHarland Williams as Carl\n\nSee also\nList of Wii games\nList of Nintendo DS games\n\nReferences\n\nCategory:2007 video games\nCategory:Avalanche Software games\nCategory:Cancelled PlayStation Portable games\nCategory:Cancelled Xbox games\nCategory:Video games based on films\nCategory:Game Boy Advance games\nCategory:GameCube games\nCategory:Nintendo DS games\nCategory:PlayStation 2 games\nCategory:PlayStation Network games\nCategory:Video games developed in the United States\nCategory:Wii games\nCategory:Windows games\nCategory:Xbox 360 games"
