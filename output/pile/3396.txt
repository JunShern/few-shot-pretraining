    "text": "By Kim Jae-heun\n\nCelebrities from around the world were in attendance as fashion mogul Karl Lagerfeld presented his first Chanel Cruise collection at the Dongdaemun Design Plaza (DDP), Monday.\n\nLagerfeld, head designer of Chanel, said that he loves traditional Korean clothes, \u201chanbok,\u201d material and patterns.\n\n\u201cThe concept is a modern, international version of a typical Korean mood, how we see it for the modern 21st century but with inspiration from the past,\u201d Lagerfeld said.\n\nThe top designer\u2019s Seoul show, brought a host of K-pop stars, such as CL and G-Dragon, as well as international celebrities, including Tilda Swinton, Kristen Stewart, Gisele Bundchen and Barbara Palvin.\n\nThe event was the second Cruise collection the French fashion house held in Asia after hosting one in Singapore in 2013.\n\nThe Cruise collection, or resort collection, began as an event to offer ready-to-wear clothing for wealthy consumers traveling on cruises during the winter season. Luxury fashion labels now open the event annually, including Chanel\u2019s in May. They have become a barometer to see brands\u2019 future trends for spring and summer lines.\n\nThe Chanel 2015/16 Cruise collection in Seoul was a show full of energy. Karl Lagerfeld, Chanel\u2019s head designer and creative director, melted bright colors like fuchsia pink, coral vivid orange and violet into the brand\u2019s signature woven tweeds and textured cotton. He used light and diaphanous fabrics such as linen, organza, tulle, lace and shantung \u2013 a type of raw silk that the brand\u2019s founder Mademoiselle Chanel often favored. Lagerfeld completed the pieces with ethereal and geometric patchworks and multi-colored stripes combined with delicate floral embroidery.\n\nThe top designer took inspiration from the Korean traditional dress \u201cHanbok\u201d combining Asian sophistication and a contemporary spirit. Jackets had large sleeves and rounded shoulders while the original costume\u2019s flat or folded collars were hidden. Lagerfeld cut the trousers wide and short, with skirts straight or pencil-shape just below the knee.\n\n\u201cI was impressed by his design of saekdong-jeogori (the Korean traditional jacket with sleeves of multicolored stripes) and the idea to graft origami as garments,\u201d said Jung Ryeo-won, a Korean actress.\n\nSome 1,000 VIPs including press and celebrities from around the world participated at the event.\n\nBritish actress and fashion muse Tilda Swinton made her second visit to Korea, which she called her second home.\n\n\u201cKorea is full of friends for me,\u201d said Swinton before the event began. \u201cI am very curious about whites and colors. I am looking forward to seeing the show.\u201d\n\nSoo Joo, a Korean fashion model for Chanel, expressed her delight to perform the show in her home country.\n\n\u201cI have been working with Channel for two years and I am more than happy to show the modern and traditional side of Seoul,\u201d Soo Joo said. Lagerfeld picked her as the Chanel muse representing Asia at the fashion show.\n\nWorld renowned model Gisele Bunchen visiting Korea for the first time and Namie Amuro attended the show. American actress Kristen Stewart from \u201cThe Twilight Saga\u201d film series was presented as a face of Chanel, while 21-year old Hungarian model Barbara Palvin was also in attendance.\n\nChanel model Jade de Lavareille of IMG models, said the Cruise collection as one of the best events she had ever taken part in.\n\n\u201cI started modeling two years ago and it is my second time with Chanel since a show at Brasseries Gabrielle in Paris, last March,\u201d Lavereille said. \u201cComing to Korea on the other side of the world is such a different culture from what I am used to. People are nice and the places look so beautiful.\n\n\u201cI was really excited to model at the show because the clothes were so beautiful. I loved the colors and texture. It looked amazing in set and overall matched perfectly,\u201d Lavereille said."
