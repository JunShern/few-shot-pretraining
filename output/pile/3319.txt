Glover and Ann B.\n      Petersen, for Defendant.\n\n\n      STEPHENS, Judge.\n\n\n                 Factual Background and Procedural History\n\n       On   12    October   2009,   Defendant     Marshall    Lee   Eller    was\n\nindicted on sixteen counts of indecent liberties with a child\n\f                                         -2-\nand one count of first-degree sex offense.1\n\n       Prior to the trial, the State moved for joinder of all\n\ncharges. The trial court granted the motion and found that the\n\ncharges constituted a single scheme or plan, noting that the\n\nsame attorney represented Defendant on all charges, the facts\n\nsurrounding each charge were similar in scheme or plan, joinder\n\nwould not impair Defendant\u2019s ability to present a defense, and\n\nthe    charges    were   \u201cnot    so    separate   in   time   and    place   or    so\n\ndistinct in circumstance as to render their consolidation unjust\n\nor prejudicial to . . . Defendant.\u201d The case came on for trial\n\non 18 March 2013, and verdicts were rendered on 22 March 2013.\n\nThe State\u2019s evidence tended to show the following:\n\n       Over the span of twenty-two years, Defendant engaged in\n\nindecent         liberties      with      three        children:      Defendant\u2019s\n\nstepdaughter,       \u201cMary\u201d;     Mary\u2019s   childhood      friend,     \u201cBrenda\u201d;     and\n\nDefendant\u2019s stepgranddaughter, \u201cAlison.\u201d2 The incidents involving\n\nMary took place between 1985 and 1992, beginning when she was\n\nnine    years     old.   The    incidents      involving   Brenda     took   place\n\n\n\n1\n  Neither the indictment nor the verdict for the charge of first-\ndegree sex offense appears in the record. However, both the\nrecord and transcript indicate that Defendant was charged with\nand found not guilty of this offense.\n2\n    Pseudonyms are used to protect the juveniles\u2019 identities.\n\f                                          -3-\nbetween August of 1987 and April of 1988, beginning when she was\n\neleven    years   old.        The   incidents   involving   Alison     took   place\n\nbetween 2004 and 2008, beginning when she was eleven years old.\n\n        A. Mary (1985 to 1992)\n\n        Mary testified to two specific incidents between her and\n\nDefendant as well as a series of reoccurring incidents that took\n\nplace from when she was nine years old until she was eighteen.\n\nIn addition, Mary testified to two other types of reoccurring\n\nincidents, the first of which took place beginning when she was\n\nten years old until she was thirteen and the second of which\n\nwent on as she grew older. The first specific incident between\n\nDefendant and Mary occurred when Mary was about nine years old.\n\nDefendant took Mary, who lived with Defendant until she was\n\neighteen, into his bedroom, wrestled with her, lifted her shirt,\n\nand kissed her on the stomach and chest. The second specific\n\nincident occurred when Mary was approximately twelve years old.\n\nDefendant instructed Mary to lie on the floor in his bedroom,\n\nwhere    he    rubbed    her    back   and   bottom   through    her   nightgown,\n\nreached his hand underneath her underwear, and placed his finger\n\nin her vagina.\n\n        The series of reoccurring incidents took place from the\n\ntime    Mary    was     ten    until   she   was   eighteen.    Defendant     would\n\f                                       -4-\nregularly      instruct   her   to   sit     on    his    lap,   raise    her   shirt,\n\nfondle her, and put his mouth on her breasts for roughly fifteen\n\nminutes at a time. About once a week, Defendant would also place\n\nMary\u2019s hand \u201con the outside of his pants at his crotch area\u201d\n\nwhere she could feel his erect penis. About three times a week,\n\nDefendant would come to Mary\u2019s room at night and, as she lay on\n\nher stomach, lift her nightgown, rub her back, pull down her\n\nunderwear slightly, and rub her bottom. During these bedtime\n\nvisits, Defendant would also attempt to roll Mary over or put\n\nhis hands underneath her in an attempt to touch her breasts.\n\nThese visits occurred \u201cpretty often\u201d and would last \u201c[thirty]\n\nminutes to an hour at times.\u201d\n\n        The first other reoccurring incident took place when Mary\n\nwas between the ages of ten and thirteen. While staying at a\n\nhouse he owned and rented to his sister, Defendant took Mary for\n\nmotorcycle rides and, in a secluded area, \u201cwould turn around and\n\n. . .    feel    [Mary\u2019s]    breasts.\u201d       Second,       as    Mary    got    older,\n\nDefendant \u201c[attempted] to come into the bathroom whenever [Mary]\n\nwas in the shower.\u201d Defendant would open the shower curtain,\n\npeek at Mary, and touch her breasts.\n\n        Mary    testified   that     \u201cmost    of    the    time,\u201d   the    incidents\n\noccurred in the mobile home that Defendant shared with Mary\u2019s\n\f                                -5-\nmother. Other times, the incidents occurred when Defendant and\n\nMary were in a car or in the house Defendant owned and rented to\n\nhis sister.\n\n\n\n     B. Brenda (1987 to 1988)\n\n     Brenda came to know Defendant through his stepdaughter,\n\nMary. The first incident between Defendant and Brenda occurred\n\nwhen Defendant entered Mary\u2019s room to tuck in both Mary and\n\nBrenda during a sleepover. As Defendant tucked in the two girls,\n\nhe \u201cwent up [Brenda\u2019s] shirt and [rubbed her] breasts.\u201d He then\n\nput \u201chis hand . . . under [her] panties . . . [and rubbed] the\n\noutside of [her] vagina.\u201d\n\n     A second incident occurred in spring 1988 when Defendant\n\ninvited Brenda on a motorcycle ride with him. Defendant stopped\n\nhis motorcycle in the woods and \u201ctook his hand and put it on\n\n[Brenda\u2019s] . . . vagina outside of [her] clothes and started\n\nrubbing [her].\u201d\n\n     C. Alison (2004 to 2008)\n\n     In 1995, Defendant sold his rental property and purchased a\n\nhouse. In 2004, Defendant installed a pool at that residence.\n\f                                     -6-\nAlison and her family3 spent almost every weekend at Defendant\u2019s\n\nhouse between 2004 and 2008. Defendant also visited Alison at\n\nher home.\n\n        According   to   Alison,   the   first   incident     with    Defendant\n\noccurred in August of 2004 when Alison was about eleven years\n\nold. In his garage, Defendant \u201cput his hands up [Alison\u2019s] skirt\n\non the outside of [her] panties, and [Defendant] rubbed [her]\n\nbutt.\u201d\n\n        A second incident occurred when Alison was about twelve.\n\nDefendant    gave   her    a   piggyback   ride    in   the    pool    at   his\n\nresidence.    During     the   piggyback   ride,   Defendant     rubbed     and\n\nsqueezed Alison\u2019s buttocks and thighs. He then \u201ctold [her] that\n\nhe was sorry that he made [her] feel uncomfortable and that if\n\nhe ever made [her] feel uncomfortable again that [she] should\n\ntell [Defendant], and he wouldn\u2019t do it anymore.\u201d\n\n        A third incident occurred in 2008 when Alison was about\n\nfifteen. Defendant and Alison were alone in Defendant\u2019s basement\n\nwhen he \u201cput his hand on [her] thigh and was rubbing it and then\n\nmoved [his hand] down towards [her] vagina\u201d and touched Alison\u2019s\n\nvagina through her clothing.\n\n        Although Alison did not cite specific dates, she testified\n\n3\n    Alison\u2019s father, Michael, is Mary\u2019s brother.\n\f                                        -7-\nto   two   additional    incidents      involving    Defendant.       First,     she\n\ntestified that Defendant visited her and her brother at her\n\nhome. After sending Alison\u2019s brother to take a shower, Defendant\n\napproached Alison and rubbed and squeezed her breasts through\n\nher shirt as she sat at her computer. Second, after Defendant\u2019s\n\nwife went to bed, Defendant attempted to kiss Alison on the\n\nmouth.\n\n      Alison    also      testified      to     reoccurring        incidents      of\n\nmisconduct. \u201cThere were several times that [Alison] would be in\n\nthe basement, and [Defendant] would come down and just rub [her]\n\non the butt from behind, and he would take [her] hands and put\n\nthem on his penis.\u201d Additionally, \u201c[a] few times in the car,\n\n[Defendant]    would     . . .    rub    [Alison\u2019s]        leg     while    he   was\n\ndriving.\u201d    Besides    these    few    times   in   the    car,    the    touching\n\noccurred    \u201c[n]owhere    else    besides       [Alison\u2019s    and     Defendant\u2019s]\n\nhouses.\u201d\n\n      At the close of the State\u2019s evidence, Defendant moved to\n\ndismiss the charges       against him. The trial court denied the\n\nmotion.     Thereafter,     Defendant         testified,     denied        all   the\n\nallegations, and again moved to dismiss the charges. Again, the\n\ntrial court denied the motion.\n\n      The jury returned guilty verdicts on sixteen                        counts of\n\f                                    -8-\nindecent liberties with a child. The jury found Defendant not\n\nguilty on one count of first-degree sex offense. Defendant gave\n\nnotice of appeal in open court.\n\n                                 Discussion\n\n     On appeal, Defendant contends the trial court erred by (1)\n\njoining the charges arising from the incidents occurring between\n\n1985 and 1992 with those arising from the incidents occurring\n\nbetween 2004 and 2008 and (2) denying Defendant\u2019s motion to\n\ndismiss one of the three charges of indecent liberties with\n\nBrenda. We hold that the trial court committed harmless error in\n\njoining all the charges for trial. We vacate one of the three\n\nconvictions of indecent liberties with Brenda and remand for\n\nresentencing.\n\n     I. Joinder of Charges\n\n          A. Transactional Relationship\n\n     As   noted   above,   the    trial   court      joined   the   1985\u20131992\n\ncharges with the 2004\u20132008 charges            on the grounds that       \u201cthe\n\ntransactions    are   connected    together    and    . . .   constitute   a\n\nsingle scheme or plan.\u201d\n\n     On appeal, Defendant argues that joinder of all the charges\n\nwas improper. According to Defendant, the fact that                  all the\n\ncharges may have been committed \u201cunder the same general modus\n\f                                           -9-\noperandi      is   not     enough    to   supply    the    required        transactional\n\nconnection [and, therefore, is] not enough to make [the charges]\n\na series of connected acts which constitute a single plan or\n\nscheme.\u201d      Defendant       further     argues        that     \u201csexually        abus[ing]\n\nadolescent girls that were in . . . [D]efendant\u2019s home or to\n\nwhom [Defendant] had access\u201d does not constitute a common scheme\n\nor plan. In addition, Defendant points out that the twelve years\n\nseparating the 2004\u20132008 charges from the 1985\u20131992 charges is a\n\nfar greater gap in time than in previous cases where this Court\n\nhas found joinder of charges to be proper.\n\n       When     determining        whether   offenses          should    be   joined      for\n\ntrial,     N.C.     Gen.     Stat.    \u00a7   15A-926(a)           \u201crequires      a   two-step\n\nanalysis: (1) a determination of whether the offenses have a\n\ntransactional connection, and (2) if there is such a connection,\n\nconsideration then must be given as to whether the accused can\n\nreceive a fair hearing on more than one charge at the same\n\ntrial.\u201d State v. Perry, 142 N.C. App. 177, 180-81, 541 S.E.2d\n\n746,     748\u201349     (2001)       (citation   and        internal        quotation     marks\n\nomitted).       \u201cThe     [legal]     determination        of    whether       a   group   of\n\noffenses are [sic] transactionally related so that they may be\n\njoined    for      trial    is   a   question      of   law     fully     reviewable      on\n\nappeal.\u201d State v. Guarascio, 205 N.C. App. 548, 553, 696 S.E.2d\n\f                                           -10-\n704, 709 (2010) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nHowever,     the       decision      regarding    whether       to       join     offenses\n\npursuant to that relationship is within the sound discretion of\n\nthe trial court. State v. Miller, 61 N.C. App. 1, 5, 300 S.E.2d\n\n431,      435      (1983)      (citations         omitted).          Therefore,        the\n\ndetermination         of    whether    the    offenses     have      a    transactional\n\nconnection is reviewed de novo, and the determination of whether\n\nthe defendant can receive a fear hearing if the offenses are\n\njoined is reviewed for abuse of discretion. See Perry, 142 N.C.\n\nApp. at 180-81, 541 S.E.2d at 748\u201349.\n\n         Joinder of charges in a criminal case is proper when the\n\ncharges are \u201cbased on the same act or transaction or on a series\n\nof acts or transactions connected together or constituting parts\n\nof   a   single       scheme   or    plan.\u201d   N.C.      Gen.   Stat.      \u00a7     15A-926(a)\n\n(2013).     Joinder is improper when \u201cthe offenses are so separate\n\nin time and place and so distinct in circumstances as to render\n\nconsolidation unjust and prejudicial [to the defendant].\u201d State\n\nv.   Chandler,        324   N.C.    172,   188,   376    S.E.2d      728,     738   (1989)\n\n(citation       and    internal     quotation     marks    omitted).          \u201c[O]ffenses\n\nthat are committed on separate dates cannot be joined for trial,\n\neven when they are of like character, unless the circumstances\n\nof each offense are so distinctly similar that they serve almost\n\f                                          -11-\nas a fingerprint.\u201d State v. Williams, 74 N.C. App. 695, 697, 329\n\nS.E.2d 705, 707 (1985).\n\n     This Court has allowed joinder of charges involving the\n\nsexual abuse of minors when that abuse was separated by five\n\nmonths. State v. Street, 45 N.C. App. 1, 5-6, 262 S.E.2d 365,\n\n368 (1980) (\u201c[W]e think that even though the time period [of\n\nfive months] between some of the acts was substantial, the acts\n\nwere nonetheless so similar in circumstance and place as not to\n\nrender     the    [joinder]      of     the        offenses    prejudicial         to     the\n\ndefendant.\u201d).      We     have       declined,       however,        to    join    charges\n\ninvolving    the       sexual    abuse    of       minors     when    that       abuse    was\n\nseparated by as many as seven years.

App. 18, 29, 533 S.E.2d 248, 255 (2000) (holding\n\nthat the seven years between offenses and the non-uniform nature\n\nof the individual acts meant that the defendant did not have a\n\nsingle scheme or plan); State v.

Due to the separation of time and the lack of\n\nuniformity in the defendant\u2019s conduct, this Court concluded that\n\njoinder was improper. See id.\n\n       In Bowen, this Court was unwilling to permit joinder of\n\ncharges    of    alleged       sexual    crimes    against      children       when   the\n\ncharges occurred over twelve years, were separated by a maximum\n\nof    seven     years,    involved      three     different     victims,        and    the\n\nindividual acts were of differing natures. Bowen, 139 N.C. App.\n\nat 30, 533 S.E.2d at 255. There, the first victim testified that\n\nin May of 1996, the defendant forced her onto a bed, pinned her\n\ndown, and inserted his fingers into her vagina. Id. at 21, 533\n\nS.E.2d    at    250.     She   also     testified       that   the    defendant       \u201chad\n\ninappropriately touched her on a regular basis.\u201d Id. at 21, 533\n\nS.E.2d    at    250\u201351.    The    second       victim    testified      that    \u201cin    the\n\nsummer of 1996, [the] defendant forcibly touched her private\n\f                                   -13-\nparts[.]\u201d Id. The third victim, nineteen years old at the time\n\nof trial, testified that the defendant had abused her since she\n\nwas a young child, including forcing her to perform oral sex on\n\nthe defendant multiple times. Id. at 21, 533 S.E.2d at 251.\n\n     By contrast, in Street, this Court found joinder of alleged\n\nsexual crimes involving three victims to be proper when the\n\nincidents were separated by five months. 45 N.C. App. at 6, 262\n\nS.E.2d at 368. There, each alleged incident \u201coccurred at the\n\nsame place and under the same circumstances.\u201d Id. at 5-6, 262\n\nS.E.2d at 368. In that case, the victims were siblings; all the\n\nincidents occurred for a long period of time; every time the\n\ndefendant was given access, he abused his stepchildren; and, in\n\neach incident, the defendant used his authority as a parent to\n\ncoerce his victims. Id. at 6, 262 S.E.2d at 368.\n\n     Here,   the   offenses     concerning    Alison   took    place,   at   a\n\nminimum, twelve years after the offenses concerning Mary and\n\nBrenda. In addition, the incidents involving Alison were not\n\nsufficiently similar to the incidents involving Mary and Brenda.\n\nAlison testified that she was abused in Defendant\u2019s home, in her\n\nhome, and in Defendant\u2019s car. Defendant gained access to Alison\n\nthrough   family   gatherings    and   his   relationship     with   Alison\u2019s\n\nbrother. In contrast, Mary testified that the abuse occurred on\n\f                                        -14-\na   motorcycle,     in     her     bedroom     in   Defendant\u2019s     house,    in\n\nDefendant\u2019s bedroom, and in Defendant\u2019s bathroom when Mary would\n\nshower. Notably, Defendant would often visit Mary in her bedroom\n\nat night. Defendant had access to Mary because she lived in his\n\nhome whereas Alison never lived with Defendant. Brenda\u2019s abuse\n\noccurred     in   Mary\u2019s    bedroom      and   on    a    motorcycle.    Because\n\nDefendant\u2019s access to Mary was of a different character than his\n\naccess to Alison, the crimes against Mary and Alison are no more\n\nuniform than the conduct in Owens. See 135 N.C. App. at 459-60,\n\n520 S.E.2d at 593. As in Owens, the incidents in this case took\n\nplace in a number of different ways and places. Defendant would\n\nisolate Alison     by instructing her brother to take a shower,\n\nleaving Defendant alone with his victim; he would molest his\n\nvictims when he was alone in the victim\u2019s house; he would molest\n\nhis victims when the victim was alone in Defendant\u2019s house; and,\n\nonce, he took indecent liberties with two victims while both\n\nwere present. Moreover, the abuse occurred on a motorcycle, in\n\nseveral bedrooms, in a pool, and in a basement.\n\n      \u201cNorth Carolina appellate courts have been willing to find\n\na transactional connection in cases involving sexual abuse of\n\nchildren.\u201d    Bowen,     139     N.C.   App.   at   29,   533   S.E.2d   at   255\n\n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). However, we are\n\f                                   -15-\nnot aware of any cases allowing joinder of offenses separated by\n\na period of time longer than two years. See, e.g., State v.\n\nEstes, 99 N.C. App 312, 317, 393 S.E.2d 158, 161 (1990). Here,\n\nthe incidents involving Alison took place twelve years after the\n\nincidents involving Mary and Brenda. The State cites Street, 45\n\nN.C. App. at 1, 262 S.E.2d at 365, to support its position that\n\nthe time between the 1985\u20131992 charges and the 2004\u20132008 charges\n\nis not too long to make joinder improper. That case, however,\n\nheld only that incidents occurring \u201cat the same place and under\n\nthe   same    circumstances,\u201d   five   months    apart,     may   be   joined.\n\nStreet, 45 N.C. App. at 5\u20136, 262 S.E.2d at 368. Street is not\n\ncontrolling where the charges are separated by twelve years, as\n\nhere. Therefore, because the incidents are separated by twelve\n\nyears and the conduct is no more uniform than the conduct in\n\nOwens, we hold that the trial court erred in determining that\n\nthe   abuse     concerning   Alison    from     2004   to    2008      was   so\n\ntransactionally linked to the abuse concerning Brenda and Mary\n\nfrom 1985 to 1992 that joinder of all the charges was proper.\n\n             B. Unfair Prejudice\n\n      Even though the charges were improperly joined, Defendant\n\ndoes not articulate any meaningful prejudice resulting from that\n\njoinder, nor do we perceive any. On appeal, Defendant merely\n\f                                              -16-\nasserts that \u201cjoinder would prejudice . . . [his] ability to\n\nreceive a fair trial.\u201d At trial, Defendant argued that joinder\n\nwas improper because \u201cany arguments made by the [d]efense would\n\nbe   clouded       by     these    other       allegations       . . .    hanging      over\n\n[Defendant\u2019s] head.\u201d We note, however, that \u201cevidence of other\n\nmolestations would have been admissible pursuant to . . . Rule\n\n404(b) [of the North Carolina Rules of Evidence] to show intent,\n\nplan, or design\u201d even if the charges had not been joined. See\n\nBowen, 139 N.C. App. at 29, 533 S.E.2d at 255 (\u201c[S]hould the\n\ntrial court allow joinder, and on appeal that joinder be deemed\n\nerror, this Court should review any resulting prejudice with\n\nreference     to    Rule    404(b).\u201d)         (citation    and    internal     quotation\n\nmarks omitted).\n\n      Under        Rule    404(b),       intent,      plan,      or   design     may     be\n\nestablished using a \u201clower threshold of proof than that needed\n\nto   establish      the     \u2018series     of     acts   or   transactions        connected\n\ntogether or constituting parts of a single scheme or plan,\u2019\n\nwhich must be shown for joinder of offenses for trial under\n\nsection 15A-926(a).\u201d Id.               \u201cThe very terms used in section 15A-\n\n926(a) requiring a \u2018single scheme or plan,\u2019 are more exacting\n\nthan the term \u2018plan\u2019 used in Rule 404(b).\u201d Owens, 135 N.C. App.\n\nat   460,   520     S.E.2d        at   593.    Therefore,     even       if   joinder   is\n\f                                             -17-\nimproper,    additional         victims      may     still    testify       about     similar\n\nincidents under Rule 404(b). As a result, the jury would still\n\nbe aware of the existence of allegations from multiple victims\n\nand give that fact weight in their deliberations. See N.C. Gen.\n\nStat. \u00a7 8C-1, Rule 404(b) (2013).\n\n      In a criminal case, evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or\n\nacts is admissible under Rule 404(b) as long as it is relevant\n\nfor some purpose other than to show that the defendant has a\n\npropensity for the type of conduct for which he is being tried\n\nand   as   long    as    it    is   not      too    remote.       See,    e.g.,   State   v.\n\nFrazier, 344 N.C. 611, 616, 476 S.E.2d 297, 300 (1996) (holding\n\nthat prior acts of sexual abuse alleged to have occurred over a\n\ntime period of seven to twenty-seven years before trial were\n\nadmissible    to        show    a   common          plan     or    scheme);       State   v.\n\nDeLeonardo,       315    N.C.    762,     771,       340   S.E.2d        350,   357   (1986)\n\n(holding     that       testimony       of     the     defendant\u2019s         three-year-old\n\ndaughter regarding his sexual conduct toward her was admissible\n\nto establish a common plan or scheme in the defendant\u2019s trial\n\nfor molesting his two sons); State v. Goforth, 59 N.C. App. 504,\n\n506, 297 S.E.2d 128, 129 (1982) (affirming the trial court\u2019s\n\nadmission of two sisters\u2019 testimony regarding the defendant\u2019s\n\nsexual abuse to show a pattern of conduct in the defendant\u2019s\n\f                                       -18-\ntrial for sexual abuse of his stepdaughter), reversed on other\n\ngrounds, 307 N.C. 699, 307 S.E.2d 162 (1983).\n\n       While the admissibility of evidence is not dispositive of\n\nthe absence of prejudice, admissibility \u201cmay be considered in\n\ndetermining whether the consolidation [of charges for purposes\n\nof joinder] was unjust and prejudicial to the defendant.\u201d State\n\nv. Corbett, 309 N.C. 382, 389, 307 S.E.2d 139, 144 (1983). When\n\nexamining the prejudicial impact of joining offenses, this Court\n\n\u201cmust look to whether [the] defendant was hindered or deprived\n\nof his ability to defend one or more of the charges.\u201d Id. at\n\n389,   307    S.E.2d   at    144.   Although   the   trial   court   erred   in\n\njoining      the   charges   in     this   case,   neither   the   record    nor\n\nDefendant\u2019s arguments support the conclusion that Defendant was\n\nprejudicially hindered or deprived of his ability to defend one\n\nor more of the charges. Accordingly, Defendant\u2019s first argument\n\nis overruled.\n\n       II. Motion to Dismiss\n\n       \u201cThis Court reviews the trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to\n\ndismiss de novo.\u201d State v. Smith, 186 N.C. App. 57, 62, 650\n\nS.E.2d 29, 33 (2007) (citation omitted).\n\n              Upon [the] defendant\u2019s motion for dismissal,\n              the question for the Court is whether there\n              is   substantial   evidence  (1)   of   each\n              essential element of the offense charged, or\n\f                                         -19-\n              of a lesser offense included therein, and\n              (2)   of   [the]    defendant\u2019s being the\n              perpetrator of such offense. If so, the\n              motion is properly denied.\n\nState    v.   Fritsch,     351    N.C.   373,    378,   526    S.E.2d    451,   455\n\n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted), cert. denied,\n\n531 U.S. 890, 148 L. Ed. 2d 150 (2000). \u201cSubstantial evidence is\n\nsuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as\n\nadequate to support a conclusion.\u201d State v. Smith, 300 N.C. 71,\n\n78-79, 265 S.E.2d 164, 169 (1980). \u201cIn making its determination,\n\nthe trial court must consider all evidence admitted, whether\n\ncompetent or incompetent, in the light most favorable to the\n\nState,    giving     the    State    the      benefit   of     every    reasonable\n\ninference and resolving any contradictions in its favor.\u201d State\n\nv.   Rose,    339   N.C.   172,     192\u201393,     451   S.E.2d   211,     223   (1994)\n\n(citation omitted), cert. denied, 515 U.S. 1135, 132 L. Ed. 2d\n\n818 (1995).\n\n        On appeal, Defendant argues that the trial court erred in\n\ndenying his motion to dismiss one of the charges of indecent\n\nliberties concerning Brenda because \u201c[t]ouching two parts of a\n\nchild\u2019s body in the course of a single incident is one crime,\n\nnot two.\u201d The State offers no objection and concedes that it \u201cis\n\nunable to distinguish the cases cited by [D]efendant from the\n\ncase at bar.\u201d We find Defendant\u2019s argument persuasive.\n\f                                   -20-\n       When examining acts prosecuted under the statute governing\n\nthe taking of indecent liberties with children under N.C. Gen\n\nStat. \u00a7 14-202.1(a)(1),\n\n            our Supreme Court has stated that the evil\n            the legislature sought to prevent in this\n            context was the defendant\u2019s performance of\n            any immoral, improper, or indecent act in\n            the presence of a child for the purpose of\n            arousing or gratifying sexual desire. [The\n            d]efendant\u2019s purpose for committing such act\n            is the gravamen of this offense; the\n            particular act performed is immaterial.\n\nState v. Jones, 172 N.C. App 308, 315, 616 S.E.2d 15, 20 (2005)\n\n(citation    and   internal   quotation    marks    omitted).       \u201c[A]lthough\n\n[N.C. Gen. Stat \u00a7 14-202.1] sets out alternative acts that might\n\nestablish an element of the offense, a single act can support\n\nonly one conviction.\u201d Id.\n\n       As   Defendant     notes    in     his     brief,     this     case   is\n\nindistinguishable from State v. Laney, 178 N.C. App. 337, 631\n\nS.E.2d 522 (2006). There we found that \u201c[the] defendant\u2019s acts\n\nof touching the victim\u2019s breasts and putting his hands inside\n\nthe waistband of her pants were part of one transaction that\n\noccurred the night [in question]. The sole act involved was\n\ntouching \u2014 not two distinct sexual acts.\u201d Id. at 341, 631 S.E.2d\n\nat 524. Here, Defendant was indicted for and convicted of three\n\nacts   of   indecent   liberties   against      Brenda.    However,    Brenda\u2019s\n\f                                         -21-\ntestimony proved only two occasions on which Defendant touched\n\nher   inappropriately.         The    first     occasion       occurred       when    Brenda\n\nspent    the   night    with     Mary    in     her    bed.    The       second    occasion\n\noccurred when Defendant took Brenda on a motorcycle ride. The\n\nthree indictments concerning indecent liberties against Brenda\n\nlay out no specifics other than a date range, and all three\n\nindictments     are    identical.       Accordingly,          we    conclude       that    the\n\ntrial court erred in denying the motion to dismiss one of the\n\nthree    indecent      liberties       charges        concerning         Brenda,     and   we\n\nvacate the corresponding conviction.\n\n        Defendant\u2019s      three        convictions        for       indecent        liberties\n\nagainst Brenda were consolidated into one judgment. When one\n\nsuch conviction is vacated, \u201cthe better procedure is to remand\n\nfor resentencing . . . .\u201d State v. Wortham, 318 N.C. 669, 674,\n\n351   S.E.2d   294,     297    (1987).        Accordingly,         we    remand    judgment\n\nnumber    12   CRS     51941     to     the    trial     court          for   resentencing\n\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\n        NO PREJUDICIAL ERROR in part; VACATED AND REMANDED in part.\n\n        Judges STROUD and MCCULLOUGH concur.\n\n        Report per Rule 30(e).\n\f"
