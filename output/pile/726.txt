    "text": "Pakistani cricket team in Australia in 2016\u201317\n\nThe Pakistani cricket team toured Australia in December 2016 to play three Test matches and five One Day Internationals (ODIs). The 1st Test at The Gabba in Brisbane was a day/night match played with a pink ball. In preparation for the first Test, ten matches in Pakistan's 2016\u201317 Quaid-e-Azam Trophy and the first round of matches in Australia's 2016\u201317 Sheffield Shield season were played as day/night matches. Ahead of the Test matches, Pakistan also played a first-class match against Cricket Australia XI.\n\nThis was Pakistan's 17th tour of Australia, with their previous tour occurring in 2009\u201310. During that tour they lost both the Test and the ODI series in a clean sweep and also lost the only T20I match. The last time that these teams met was 2014\u201315 in the United Arab Emirates where Pakistan won the Test series 2\u20130 but Australia won the ODI series 3\u20130. The Australians come into this Test series after recently losing their previous two series \u2013 against Sri Lanka abroad and to South Africa at home. They enter the ODI series after a 4\u20131 series victory against Sri Lanka, a 9 wicket win over Ireland and a 5\u20130 series defeat away to South Africa \u2013 the first time that Australia had lost all five matches in a five-match ODI series. However, immediately prior to this series, Australia won back the Chappell\u2013Hadlee Trophy, defeating New Zealand in a 3\u20130 whitewash.\n\nAustralia won the Test series 3\u20130. Their victory in the third Test was their 12th consecutive win against Pakistan in Tests in Australia. Australia won the ODI series 4\u20131.\n\nSquads\n\nMohammad Asghar was added to Pakistan's squad as back-up for Yasir Shah. After the first Test, Hilton Cartwright was added to Australia's squad. Ashton Agar and Steve O'Keefe were added to Australia's squad for third Test with Nic Maddinson and Chadd Sayers being dropped. Mohammad Hafeez was added to Pakistan's ODI squad after the conclusion of the Test series. Mohammad Irfan left Pakistan's ODI squad after the death of his mother and was replaced by Junaid Khan. Sarfraz Ahmed also left Pakistan's squad after his mother was admitted into hospital. Mitchell Marsh and Chris Lynn were withdrawn from Australia's ODI squad due to injury, with Marcus Stoinis and Peter Handscomb replacing them respectively. Billy Stanlake was not included in Australia's squad for 5th ODI as he went to New Zealand for preparation ahead of the Chappell-Hadlee series.\n\nTour matches\n\nFirst-class match: Cricket Australia XI vs Pakistanis\n\n50-over match: Cricket Australia XI vs Pakistanis\n\nTest series\n\n1st Test\n\n2nd Test\n\n3rd Test\n\nODI series\n\n1st ODI\n\n2nd ODI\n\n3rd ODI\n\n4th ODI\n\n5th ODI\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Series home at ESPN Cricinfo\n\nCategory:2016 in Australian cricket\nCategory:2016 in Pakistani cricket\nCategory:International cricket competitions in 2016\u201317\nCategory:Pakistani cricket tours of Australia\nCategory:2016\u201317 Australian cricket season"
