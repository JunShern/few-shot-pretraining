If you hack the tit off with an axe it will be PG. -Jack Nicholson\nI believe in the brotherhood of man, all men, but I don't believe in brotherhood with anybody who doesn't want brotherhood with me. I believe in treating people right, but I'm not going to waste my time trying to treat somebody right who doesn't know how to return the treatment. -Malcolm X\nThis American system of ours, call it Americanism, call it capitalism, call it what you will, gives each and every one of us a great opportunity if we only seize it with both hands and make the most of it.\n- Al Capone\n\nRetire? I'm going to stay in show business until I'm the only one left.\n- George Burns at age 90\n\nThe problem with people who have no vices is that generally you can be pretty sure they're going to have some pretty annoying virtues.\n- Elizabeth Taylor\n\nIf a man is called to be a streetsweeper, he should sweep streets even as Michaelangelo painted, or Beethoven composed music, or Shakespeare wrote poetry. He should sweep streets so well that all the hosts of heaven and earth will pause to say, here lived a great streetsweeper that did his job well.\n- Martin Luther King\n\nI have a heart and I have feelings. I feel that when you do that to me, it's not nice.\n- Michael Jackson\n\nGive me a museum and I'll fill it. -Pablo Picasso\n\nBut I refuse to believe that I am a better actor than myself.\n- Jim Carrey\n\nIt's kind of fun to do the impossible.\n- Walt Disney\n\nIf you're going through hell, keep going. -Walt Disney\n\nEvery man wishes to be wise, and they who cannot be wise are almost always cunning. -Samuel Jackson\nInformation is not knowledge. Knowledge is not wisdom. Wisdom is not truth. Truth is not beauty. Beauty is not love. Love is not music. Music is the Best.\n- Frank Zappa\n\nThe attraction of being wild is living on the edge, living up to the reputations of the people you've been following or emulating. People are always talking about how wild and exciting they were, but the key word is 'were', because there's a long list of dead, famous people.\n- Christian Slater\n\nYou can see our respect for women by the fact that we have pledged to pay working women, even though they don't have to work.\n- Taliban Information Minister Amir Kan Muttaqi\n\nI wanted revenge; I wanted to dance on the graves of a few people who made me unhappy. It's a pretty infantile way to go through life - I'll show them - but I've done it, and I've got more than I ever dreamed of.\n- Anthony Hopkins\nMore Funny Sayings...\n\nCocaine is God's way of saying you're making too much money.\n- Robin Williams\n\nAnyone who can walk to the welfare office can walk to work.\n- Al Capone\n\nIt's better to live one day as a lion, than a hundred as a sheep. -Benito Mussollini\nA lot of people are afraid to say what they want. That's why they don't get what they want.\n- Madonna\n\nI wish people could acheive what they think would bring them happiness in order for them to realize that that's not what happiness really is.\n- Alanis Morisette\n\nThe key to immortallity, is living a life which is worth to be remembered.

I take my spirit and I crash my mirrors, now the whole world is here for me to see.\n- Jimi Hendrix\n\nOne man with courage is a majority.\n- Thomas Jefferson\n\nNo one knows my ability the way I do.
