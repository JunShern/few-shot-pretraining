    "text": "One of the most anticipated hard rock reunions of the past few years will finally take place when Dokken reunite their classic lineup of Don Dokken, George Lynch, Jeff Pilson and \u201cWild\u201d Mick Brown for seven shows.\n\nThe brief trek begins with a single U.S. date on Sept. 30 at Badlands Pawn Guns Gold and Rock \u2018N\u2019 Roll, a sold-out show that will be filmed for a possible video release later this year. (They're also performing what is being called a special \"VIP dress rehearsal\" show on Sept. 29. One hundred fans can buy tickets to the event, which is expected to quickly sell out. And it looks like the band is doing its best to avoid any spoilers for the real gig by including the following message on the ticketing page: No cameras, video or audio equipment allowed, including all cellphones. All attendees must check all phones and cameras at the door.)\n\nAfter that, the group will head to Japan for Unleashed in the East tour dates -- six shows happening between Oct. 5 and Oct. 12. Once the tour wraps up in Tokyo, \u201cwe\u2019re all going to go back to our own lives,\u201d as Don Dokken put it during a recent chat with Ultimate Classic Rock.\n\nWe spoke with Dokken and bassist and singer Jeff Pilson in separate interviews to get their thoughts on the upcoming shows. As fans are aware, there have been several attempts in the past few years to launch a reunion, including one that found the band members getting together in Pilson\u2019s studio and working on three new songs.\n\n\u201cThat was about three or four years ago and I honestly don\u2019t remember how the songs went, I don\u2019t remember what they were,\u201d Dokken says. \u201cI don\u2019t remember the lyrics, I don\u2019t remember anything. They had some ideas and George was like, \u201cWhat do you think of this?\u201d And I go, \u201cOh, that\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d It was just like a brainstorming session, and Jeff goes, \u201cWell, how about we do this for the chorus?\u201d We did that and we spent a day and did three songs, just roughed them out and that was the end of it. We never took it to the next level.\u201d\n\nNew music is again on the agenda as part of the reunion. Pilson says initial work had been done on a new song, which is still in development. \u201cSo far it\u2019s just the music,\" he says. \u201cIt\u2019s very Dokken sounding. It\u2019s very tricky to try and come up with something that sounds authentic but sounds sincere, and I think we did it. We kind of just let all go and let our inhibitions fly and it came out.\u201d\n\nBut a few weeks later, Dokken revealed that with things coming down to the wire, he wasn\u2019t sure what would happen with the new song. \u201cJeff and George wrote a riff and some music, and they sent it to me. I\u2019ve been super-busy and I\u2019ve been trying to write lyrics. The song really hasn\u2019t spoken to me as much, so I let Mick take a crack at it,\u201d Dokken explains. \u201cMick wrote an entire lyric and the whole song and it\u2019s really good, but it\u2019s too high. It\u2019s just out of everybody\u2019s range. So that needs to be taken into consideration. I think it was written in the wrong key for me. You\u2019d have to either sing really low, and it wouldn\u2019t sound good, or like super-high, and I\u2019m stuck in the middle. Jeff and I are going to try to get together.\u201d\n\nBesides the tour, Dokken's current lineup also has some shows lined up. The groups' frontman says he\u2019s been juggling a lot lately, but that he feels like he and Pilson will come away with something. \u201cI\u2019m sleeping three or four hours a night,\" he notes. \"When you go to do a tour, nobody will understand the logistics of work visas, tax, I.R.S., hotels, flights, equipment, production -- it\u2019s just never-ending on a daily basis. \u201cJeff\u2019s busy -- he\u2019s out with Foreigner, and George is getting ready, he\u2019s got shows. I\u2019m hoping to get to Jeff\u2019s house in the next four or five days and I\u2019ve got some alternative ideas that I think might be even better [for the new song], like more of an anthemic up-tempo \u2018Paris Is Burning\u2019 kind of song. It\u2019s not going to be hard -- Jeff and I are kind of on the same page -- we were cut from the same cloth as far as our likes, Beatles, the Hollies.\u201d\n\nBoth Pilson and Dokken say they\u2019re not surprised that this reunion is finally happening. Each of them point to busy schedules as the main factor that kept things from coming together earlier. \u201cWe\u2019ve been kind of dabbling and trying to talk about it for a long time,\u201d Pilson explains. \u201cScheduling was the thing we couldn\u2019t figure out. When Japan came along and offered us a date that happened to fall in a Foreigner break, it worked out great for me. How do you say no to that?\u201d\n\n\u201c[Jeff] reminds me of me 15 years ago,\" Dokken says. \"I owned a recording studio for almost 15 years, and I lived in that studio. I rarely went home. I\u2019d just make music, music, music every day. When I sold the studio, I kind of fell out of that. But Jeff has a recording studio, so when he comes home, that\u2019s where he is comfortable. He likes to be on the console. He\u2019s very, very good at Pro Tools, so he doesn\u2019t need an engineer, and that\u2019s my weak spot. I can\u2019t play guitar and push buttons at the same time. I just can\u2019t do it.\"\n\nWhen the short Dokken run of Japanese shows wraps up on Oct. 12, Pilson will be back on the road with Foreigner two days later, playing a show with the band. But he's not thinking about the super-busy schedule. Instead, he's concentrating on playing with his old bandmates again.\n\n\u201cI do love these guys,\" he says. \"There\u2019s a lot of history. When George and Mick and I play as the musical bed of the band, there is something really special that\u2019s going to feel really good. ... There\u2019s been times in the band when we, for one reason or another, weren\u2019t at our best, and this time, I really hope we\u2019re at our best. I\u2019d love to see that. That\u2019s what I\u2019m really looking forward to. The satisfaction of knowing that we\u2019ve fulfilled a lot of our potential. There is a lot of talent in the band. There is a chemistry about the band that\u2019s undeniable. When it functions, it can be really great, and I really want one more chance to show that.\u201d\n\nCould there be additional dates featuring the classic lineup? Lynch has indicated that he felt like there was a \u201c50/50 chance\u201d of that happening, at the same time choosing his words carefully when it came to discussing the current reunion. For Pilson, it would again come down to scheduling. \u201cI would be open to it. It\u2019s just got to fall in places that I can do it.,\" he says \"But if this also ends up being the last of it, I\u2019m also happy there. I\u2019ve seen Don call it an exclamation point, to go to Japan, and if this is the end, I can\u2019t think of a better way to end it.\u201d\n\nSince the reunion was announced, Dokken has been adamant that the upcoming shows would be the only chance to see the classic lineup. He stands by that now. He says a promoter recently called him and showed interest in booking the reunited band for more shows. \"He told me how much, and it was like, \u2018Wow, that\u2019s a lot of money,\u2019\" he recalls. \u201cBut it\u2019s a dilemma. How can I? Why would I want to kill my own franchise? If we go and do those [shows], then what do I do? We\u2019re supposed to go back with the other lineup, and we keep going? It would hurt the franchise. And Jeff\u2019s in Foreigner. Forever. He\u2019s not in Dokken. He\u2019s going to be in Foreigner. And George is going to do Lynch Mob. So it doesn\u2019t make any sense when the truth is, I\u2019ll still be playing those same festivals next summer with this current lineup. I just won\u2019t make as much money, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\nBut he says that's not a concern. \u201cI\u2019ve been very lucky,\" he explains. \"I have a lot of good friends that play with us, and I see what they\u2019re making, and I say, \u2018God, guys, how do you do that?\u2019 You\u2019ve got plane flights, hotels, a van, you\u2019ve got to rent a trailer, I mean, how do you tour and just make a very little amount of money? Where\u2019s all your money? You guys have platinum records. Everybody\u2019s got a story: I got divorced three times, I was doing drugs, I bought too many fancy cars, I bought a mansion with 10 bedrooms thinking it would go on forever, and it turns out it didn\u2019t go on forever. These stories go on and on and on with all of these bands from the \u201880s. You take a bunch of kids in their twenties that don\u2019t know anything and were all poor and never had a pot to pee in. And all of a sudden, you\u2019re making all of this money. You\u2019ve got a million dollars in the bank, and you buy your first home and you get married and you have kids and now you have expenses, and they just keep you going and going and going. You think it\u2019s going to go on forever.\u201d\n\nDokken's past, particularly the conflict among group members, is part of their history. There are many layers to what caused friction over the years, both Dokken and Pilson agree. \u201cBut probably one of the reasons we broke up at the top of our game was that we\u2019d already been on the road for a year and a half,\u201d Dokken says. \u201cBy the time Monsters of Rock came, nobody had been on the road for a couple of years. We show up with our tails in between our legs after doing Aerosmith, AC/DC, touring Japan, Judas Priest -- all over the country. We were tired, and when you get tired, that\u2019s when the problems start. You get the drugs, you get the alcohol, you\u2019re taking sleeping pills at night to go to bed. You\u2019re drinking too much, because you\u2019ve got nine guys on a bus and it\u2019s noisy. And then you start to argue and you start to disagree and you start to not get along. Nobody was saying, \u2018Hey guys,\u2019 they just said, \u2018Keep going, you\u2019re making money, we\u2019re making lots of money off of you guys -- c\u2019mon, keep going. If you die, you\u2019ll be even more famous!\u2019\n\n\"And that\u2019s what happened -- after Monsters of Rock, I was toast. Worn down physically and worn down spiritually. I think Jeff was too. He was doing a lot of drugs, a lot of drinking -- as was everybody. I didn\u2019t do drugs, but I did plenty of drinking and plenty of Valium, but cocaine was never my drug of choice. I didn\u2019t understand it and never got it.\u201d\n\nPilson says he's aware of the stories that surfaced over the years, \"you know, Don and George hated each other, and I was the mediator. You can make it that simple, but It wasn\u2019t that simple, of course. It was much more involved. There was a lot of unique personalities. There was a lot of ego, and there was a lot of agendas going on. Mine included. We weren\u2019t appreciative enough of what we had and we weren\u2019t smart enough to know how to pull it together and make it work so that we had one agenda instead of multiple agendas. Because had we done that, we could have been a much better force to work with.\n\n\"Had we had healthy competition, we could have gone much further,\u201d he continues. \u201cWe allowed the conflict to turn into much more than that. And it\u2019s not entirely our fault. Early on, our publicist decided that the hook about the band was that we\u2019d talk about the conflict between Don and George. That became a self-fulfilling prophecy, and that\u2019s dangerous when you do things like that. Not that it wasn\u2019t there to some extent, but it\u2019s so much more complicated and involved than the simple press soundbite could ever describe. Was I the levelheaded guy in Dokken? Sometimes. Was I pretty out of my mind sometimes? Yes. So I think there\u2019s no simplification for it. It was a complex thing that we didn\u2019t handle as well as we should have.\""
