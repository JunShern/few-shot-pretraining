He is current going for 75-80k and while may seem an okay price, there are better options out there, we suggest IF Werner, MOTM Rodrigo and SIF Gomez as alternatives, around the 70-120k price range.\n\nIn our starting team we played Muller at ST due to the team we currently rock with as he linking him to everyone around in the 4321. While his return from 3 games in the review of 5 goals and 1 assist was impressive, most of the plaudits had to come from the team creating these chances for him. Even with Anchor to boost that pace we felt he still lacked that extra turn of pace to make a difference.\nIn terms of comparing him to other attackers best way really is the IF Hulk obtained from FUT Swap plus Ben Arfa, Weah & Talisca objectives cards too.\nOverall analysis\nIs he worth it - 6/10 (Proved a useful forward but lacks that pace to make the difference to buy)\nValue - 6/10 (70-80k Spend could be used elsewhere for example Werner, if play with a quick forward Muller is not an option.\nUsability - 6/10 (Nation, Team/League Major Pros but Pace downside)\nOverall - 6/10 (A good card to own but pace lets him down sadly despite a good return.)"
