    "text": "Introduction {#S1}\n============\n\nUnderstanding the endogenous pathways that regulate inflammatory responses is of critical importance for the development of novel therapies for chronic inflammatory disease. Recent approaches for the treatment of inflammatory diseases have focussed around blocking specific inflammatory mediators such as the cytokines TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 ([@B1]--[@B3]). Whilst such approaches have been very effective for certain diseases \\[e.g., anti-TNF-\u03b1 monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA)\\] a large percentage of patients either do not respond to treatment or become refractory to therapeutic antibody treatment ([@B4], [@B5]). It is known that cytokines play a central role in shaping the immune response to invading pathogens and in the context of chronic inflammation. It is now appreciated that there exists a plethora of lipid mediators as well as other immune modulating proteins and peptides that play important roles during both the onset as well as the resolution of inflammation ([@B6]--[@B8]). Annexin-A1 and its N-terminal peptide ac2-26 have been demonstrated to exert potent pro-resolution properties in multiple inflammatory disease models ([@B8], [@B9]). Similarly, a number of lipid mediators including the resolvins, lipoxins, maresins, and protectins have been more recently come to the fore ([@B7], [@B8]). These novel immune modulatory mediators and others may represent new avenues to explore for the treatment of chronic inflammatory disease.\n\nMurine chemerin is a 16\u2009kDa protein produced and secreted as an inactive precursor, pro-chemerin, predominantly by hepatocytes and adipocytes ([@B10]). Pro-chemerin is present in the liver, spleen, skin, and plasma ([@B11], [@B12]). During an inflammatory response, inflammatory proteases produced locally by granulocytes and the coagulation cascade, cleave the carboxyl terminus of pro-chemerin to generate active chemerin isoforms at sites of inflammation ([@B13], [@B14]). Chemerin has been implicated in the pathology of a range of inflammatory diseases including RA, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease ([@B15]--[@B19]). However, the exact role played by chemerin and its receptors in inflammatory disease remains unclear.\n\nOur group and others have demonstrated that active chemerin, once generated, is a potent chemoattractant for macrophages, immature dendritic cells (DCs), plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), and NK cells ([@B20]--[@B23]). Chemerin binds to three G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) with high affinity; CMKLR1, GPR1, and CCRL2 ([@B24]). Murine GPR1 is expressed in white adipose tissue, skin, muscle, and in the central nervous system ([@B25]). Although chemerin binding to GPR1 has been reported to induce downstream signalling, chemerin is thought to act as a partial agonist at GPR1 whilst chemerin acts as a full agonist at CMKLR1 ([@B26], [@B27]). CMKLR1 is expressed on various immune cells including macrophages, DCs, NK cells, and pDCs ([@B12]). It is also expressed on endothelial cells and adipocytes ([@B28], [@B29]). *Cmklr1* mediates the chemotactic effects of chemerin, and its activation has been reported to lead to rapid downstream signalling cascades, which are G~i/0~ coupled ([@B23], [@B26]). The Chemerin/*Cmklr1* axis has been implicated in driving the recruitment of immature DCs, pDCs, and NK cells to local sites of inflammation in a number of inflammatory diseases ([@B22], [@B30]--[@B32]). Interestingly, *Cmklr1* has also been reported to play an anti-inflammatory role in a number of inflammatory disease models, although these have predominantly been allergic inflammatory models ([@B12], [@B33]). In addition, our group and others have reported anti-inflammatory effects of synthetic chemerin-derived peptides in a number of inflammation models and these effects seem to be dependent on CMKLR1 ([@B34]--[@B36]).\n\nCCRL2 is a seven transmembrane receptor that lacks the DRYLAIV intracellular motif required for classical downstream signalling by GPCRs ([@B37]). It binds chemerin but does not induce classical downstream signalling nor does it internalise chemerin ([@B20], [@B37], [@B38]). CCRL2 is expressed on a range of cell types including macrophages, DCs, endothelial cells, and epithelial cells amongst others ([@B38], [@B39]). Expression of CCRL2 is upregulated in response to inflammatory stimuli but the function of CCRL2 during inflammation remains incompletely understood ([@B39], [@B40]). Zabel et al. have proposed a model in which CCRL2 binds to the non-signalling N-terminus of chemerin and then presents it to other cells expressing CMKLR1. In this way, CCRL2 could function to concentrate chemerin at local sites to augment chemerin signalling during inflammation ([@B38]). The aim of this study was to further explore the role of the non-signalling chemerin receptor CCRL2 during a self-resolving model of acute inflammation.\n\nWe report, for the first time, that animals lacking the chemerin receptor CCRL2 displayed exaggerated neutrophil and inflammatory monocyte recruitment in models of acute inflammation. These effects were due in part to increased levels of chemerin, which augmented production of the neutrophil chemoattractant CXCL1, resulting in increased neutrophil recruitment.\n\nMaterials and Methods {#S2}\n=====================\n\nAnimals {#S2-1}\n-------\n\nB6.129-*Ccrl2^tm1Dgen^*/J mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbour, ME, USA). These mice, originally produced by Deltagen (San Mateo, CA, USA), were backcrossed for 12 generations onto the C57BL/6J background. All animal studies were conducted with ethical approval from the Dunn School of Pathology Local Ethical Review Committee and in accordance with the UK Home Office regulations (Guidance on the Operation of Animals, Scientific Procedures Act, 1986).\n\nReagents {#S2-2}\n--------\n\nRecombinant murine chemerin (aa17--156) was reconstituted in PBS supplemented with 0.1% BSA. Neutralising anti-chemerin antibody and goat IgG control were reconstituted in PBS. Both chemerin and antibodies were purchased from R&D Systems (Abingdon, UK). Zymosan was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Dorset, UK). Recombinant CCL5 was purchased from Peprotech (London, UK). Bio-gel P100 (45--90\u2009\u00b5m) fine polyacrylamide beads were obtained from BIO-RAD Laboratories, Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, UK.\n\nMurine Bone Marrow-Derived Macrophages (BMDMs) {#S2-3}\n----------------------------------------------\n\nBone marrow-derived macrophages were generated as previously described ([@B41]). Briefly, fresh bone marrow cells from tibiae and femurs of C57BL/6J mice (8--12\u2009weeks) were isolated and cultured in DMEM media supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum, 10% L929 cell-conditioned media as a source of macrophage colony-stimulating factor, 100\u2009U/ml penicillin, and 100\u2009\u00b5g/ml streptomycin for 7\u2009days. A total of 4\u2009\u00d7\u200910^6^ bone marrow cells were seeded into 10\u2009ml of medium in 100\u2009mm Petri dishes (Sterilin, Abergoed, UK.) and on day 3 an additional 5\u2009ml of medium was added. Cells were harvested by gentle agitation to lift cells off surface.\n\nHuman Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC) {#S2-4}\n----------------------------------------------\n\nHuman umbilical vein endothelial cells were isolated as previously described ([@B42]) and frozen for storage in liquid N~2~. HUVEC were thawed and resuspended in endothelial cell growth medium with supplement mix C (PromoCell, Germany), 100\u2009U/ml penicillin, and 100\u2009\u00b5g/ml streptomycin and cultured in pre-coated 0.5% gelatin (Sigma) flask/dishes in a 37\u00b0C 5% CO~2~ incubator.\n\nCell Activation Assays {#S2-5}\n----------------------\n\nCells were seeded into 6-well plates at a concentration of 1\u2009\u00d7\u200910^6^/ml. They were then exposed to TLR ligands and cytokines for 16\u2009h in a 37\u00b0C 5% CO~2~ incubator as described previously. The TLR ligands and cytokines were added to cells at a final concentration of: LPS 100\u2009\u00b5g/ml, IFN\u03b3 20\u2009ng/ml, Poly I:C 10\u2009\u00b5g/ml, zymosan 10\u2009\u00b5g/ml, flagellin 500\u2009ng/ml, IL-4 20\u2009ng/ml, and IL-13 20\u2009ng/ml.\n\nRNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription and RT-PCR {#S2-6}\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nTotal RNA was extracted using the QIAGEN RNeasy Mini kit as instructed by the manufacturer as described previously ([@B43]). RNA concentration and purity was determined using ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Nanodrop, Thermo Scientific) at 260/280 and 260/230\u2009nm. cDNA was synthesised from 500 to 800\u2009ng of total RNA using QuantiTect Reverse Transcription kit following the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was amplified for 15\u2009min at 42\u00b0C and then 3\u2009min at 95\u00b0C. Real-time quantitative PCR was performed using Sybr Select Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies) in the Step One Plus Real-time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). All primers were from QuantiTect Primer Assay (Qiagen). The thermal profile included an initiation step for 2\u2009min at 50 and 95\u00b0C followed by 40\u00d7 cycles of 15\u2009s at 95\u00b0C and 1\u2009min at 60\u00b0C. Cycle threshold values were determined by the StepOne software v2.3 and the mRNA content of samples was inferred by normalising to the housekeeping \u03b2-actin gene. Relative expression results were plotted as mRNA expression over actin, normalised to basal samples ([@B44]).\n\nZymosan or Thioglycollate Induced Peritonitis {#S2-7}\n---------------------------------------------\n\nMale *Ccrl2*^\u2212^*^/^*^\u2212^ or littermate controls were injected i.p. (0.5\u2009ml) with 100\u2009\u00b5g zymosan resuspended in PBS, or 1\u2009ml of 4% thioglycollate (Thioglycollate brewers yeast; Sigma-Aldrich, Dorset, UK) prepared as described previously ([@B45]). Mice were sacrificed at specified time points and peritoneal cavities were lavaged with 5\u2009ml ice-cold PBS supplemented with 2\u2009mM EDTA. Blood was collected from the hepatic portal vein into EDTA-coated vacutainers and centrifuged at 2,000\u2009\u00d7\u2009*g* for 20\u2009min at 4\u00b0C to obtain plasma.\n\nModulation of Chemerin Levels *In Vivo* {#S2-8}\n---------------------------------------\n\nC57BL/6J mice were treated with either recombinant murine chemerin (4\u2009\u00b5g) or PBS i.p. for 1\u2009h before zymosan challenge for 4\u2009h. Animals were sacrificed and peritoneal lavage was collected as before. *Ccrl2*^\u2212^*^/^*^\u2212^ mice were pretreated for 24\u2009h with either 100\u2009ng of isotype control IgG antibody or 100\u2009ng of anti-chemerin polyclonal antibody i.p. This was followed by a second injection of isotype control IgG or anti-chemerin antibody 1\u2009h before challenge with zymosan. Mice were sacrificed 4\u2009h later and peritoneal lavage fluid was collected as before.\n\nFlow Cytometry {#S2-9}\n--------------\n\nPeritoneal exudate cells (PECs) were resuspended in fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) buffer (PBS; 2% FCS, 25\u2009mM HEPES, 5\u2009mM EDTA) containing CD16/CD32 FC\u03b3IIR blocking antibody (eBioscience). Specific staining with the following antibodies was performed with appropriate isotype controls; F4/80 (AbD Serotec, clone CI:A3-1), Ly6B.2 (AbDSerotec, Clone 7/4), Ly6 G (BioLegend, clone 1A8), CD11b (BioLegend, clone M1/70), CD115 (BioLegend, clone AFS98), CD4 (BioLegend, clone RM4-5), CD3 (BioLegend, clone 17A2), B220 (eBioscience, clone RA3-6B2), CD8 (BD Pharminogen, clone 53-6.7), and analysed by flow cytometry. Cells were counted using CountBright Absolute Counting Beads (Life Technologies). Cells were analysed with a Dako Cyan ADP flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter Ltd., High Wycombe, UK) and FlowJo software V10 (Tree Star Incorporation, Ashland, OR, USA). Monocytes and neutrophils in the peritoneum were defined as CD45^+^, 7/4^+^, Ly6G^\u2212^ and CD45^+^, 7/4^+^, Ly6G^+^, respectively ([@B46], [@B47]). Blood was collected *via* hepatic portal vein into EDTA-coated vacutainers. Blood was treated in the same manner as the PECs, but red blood cells were lysed after antibody staining using BD FACS Lysing Solution (Buffered solution with \\<15% formaldehyde and \\<50% diethylene glycol) before fixation. Ly6C^hi^ blood monocytes were defined as CD45^+^, CD11b^+^, CD115^+^, Ly6C^hi^. Ly6C^lo^ monocytes were defined as CD45^+^, CD11b^+^, CD115^+^, Ly6C^lo^ ([@B48], [@B49]).\n\nFluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting {#S2-10}\n-----------------------------------\n\nMale C57BL/6J mice were injected i.p. (0.5\u2009ml) with 100\u2009\u00b5g zymosan resuspended in PBS. Steady state and zymosan challenged mice were sacrificed 4\u2009h later, and peritoneal cavities were lavaged with 5\u2009ml ice-cold PBS supplemented with 2\u2009mM EDTA. PECs were stained for flow cytometry as described previously. Peritoneal macrophages, monocytes, and neutrophils were FACS sorted using a Beckman Astrios cell sorter directly into RLT buffer for RNA isolation using the QIAGEN RNeasy Mini kit.\n\nDetection of Secreted Protein by ELISA and Luminex {#S2-11}\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nCXCL1, CCL2, IL-6, and chemerin in peritoneal exudate fluid and plasma were detected using ELISA (R&D Systems, Abingdon, UK). Sandwich ELISAs for chemerin, IL-6, CCL2, and CXCL1 were performed according to manufacturer's instructions. Custom multiplex polyacrylamide bead assays were purchased from R&D Systems to determine levels of CCL3, CCL4, IL-10, CXCL10, and MMP9 in peritoneal exudate fluid. Briefly, colour-coded beads were pre-coated with antibodies against the targets of interest. Biotinylated detection antibodies specific for each analyte were added, followed by phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated streptavidin. Samples were read using a laser detection system, which quantifies the amount of PE present for each analyte. The 96-well plates were read on a Bio-Rad Bioanalyser with Bio-Plex Manager software (Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, UK).\n\nACEA xCELLigence Chemotaxis Assay {#S2-12}\n---------------------------------\n\n8- to 10-week-old male *Ccrl2*^\u2212^*^/^*^\u2212^ or littermate controls were injected i.p. with 1\u2009ml 2% Bio-gel (P100 Fine, 45--90\u2009\u00b5m). PECs (mixture of inflammatory macrophages and neutrophils) were isolated by peritoneal lavage with ice-cold PBS supplemented with 2\u2009mM EDTA 4\u2009days later. Real-time chemotaxis assays were performed using the ACEA RTCA-DP instrument as described previously ([@B50], [@B51]). Briefly, vehicle, chemerin, or recombinant murine CCL5 (160\u2009\u00b5l) at 5\u2009nM final concentration was added to the lower chamber of a CIM-16 plate. The upper chamber was attached, and 50\u2009\u00b5l of prewarmed chemotaxis buffer added to each of the upper chambers. Following equilibration for 30\u2009min, the plate was transferred into the RTCA-DP system. Bio-gel elicited PECs (50\u2009\u00b5l---4\u2009\u00d7\u200910^5^\u2009cells/well), were then added to all upper wells. Cell index (CI) measurements were then taken every 5\u2009s over the 3--4\u2009h assay period. Chemotactic responses were assessed by quantifying the slope of the curve in the first 40\u2009min and by the maximum CI minus minimum CI (Max--Min) values of the curve over the entire experiment.\n\nCMKLR1 \u03b2-Arrestin Recruitment Assays {#S2-13}\n------------------------------------\n\nRecruitment of \u03b2-Arrestin to Cmklr1 was measured using the Discoverx PathHunter^\u00ae^ eXpress \u03b2-Arrestin GPCR Assay following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, CHO-K1 cells stably expressing murine Cmklr1 were seeded into 1/2 area 96-well plates (15,000 cells/well) and incubated at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO~2~ for 48\u2009h. Cells were then treated with either vehicle (Cell assay reagent) or indicated concentrations of anti-chemerin antibody for 45\u2009min at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO~2~ before stimulation with vehicle or recombinant chemerin (20\u2009nM) for 90\u2009min at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO~2~. Cells were lysed and detection of total recruited \u03b2-arrestin was determined following the manufacturers protocol and as previously described ([@B51]). Luminescence measurements were taken using a PHERAstar microplate reader (BMG Labtech).\n\nStatistical Analysis {#S2-14}\n--------------------\n\nAll quantitative data are reported as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM of *n* independent biological replicates. Statistical significance was assessed using a Student's unpaired *t*-test, one-way or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Dunnett's multiple comparison *post hoc* test (Prism 6 GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA), *P*\u2009\\<\u20090.05 was taken to be statistically significant.\n\nResults {#S3}\n=======\n\nChemerin Levels and *Ccrl2* Expression Are Increased during Acute Inflammation {#S3-1}\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe and others have previously demonstrated that i.p. challenge with zymosan induces robust inflammatory mediator production in the peritoneum as well as inflammatory cell recruitment ([@B47]). Injection of 100\u2009\u00b5g zymosan resulted in robust inflammatory cell recruitment with neutrophils peaking at 4\u2009h post zymosan challenge and monocytes peaking at 8\u2009h (Figure [1](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}A). The role played by chemerin during inflammation remains incompletely understood. To interrogate this in our model of acute inflammation, we quantified total chemerin levels in the peritoneum during this acute inflammatory response and found that levels were significantly increased compared with na\u00efve mice 4\u2009h following zymosan challenge (2.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4\u2009ng/ml at 4\u2009h compared with 1.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.3\u2009ng/ml in na\u00efve mice) (Figure [1](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}B). One caveat using an ELISA to measure chemerin levels is that it is a quantification of total chemerin levels, including inactive pro-chemerin and potentially shorter bioactive chemerin isoforms generated during inflammation. To investigate chemerin bioactivity during this acute inflammatory response, we compared the ability of the peritoneal exudate fluid from animals injected with zymosan at different time points to activate the CMKLR1 chemerin receptor on CMKLR1 transfected CHO-K1 cells (Figure [1](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}C). Using this bioassay, chemerin bioactivity progressively increased after zymosan injection peaking at 8\u2009h and decreasing to baseline levels by 96\u2009h (Figure [1](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}C). These data suggest that although total chemerin levels as measured by ELISA peaked at 4\u2009h and decreased rapidly by 8\u2009h, chemerin bioactivity continued to increase up to 8\u2009h and remained increased up to 72\u2009h post zymosan injection.\n\n![Chemerin bioactivity and *Ccrl2* expression are increased during inflammation. C57BL/6J male mice were injected i.p. with 100\u2009\u00b5g zymosan.

To confirm and extend this observation, we FACS sorted resident peritoneal macrophages as well as recruited peritoneal neutrophils and monocytes from wild-type (WT) C57BL/6J mice following a 4\u2009h zymosan challenge. We found that *Ccrl2* was expressed on three cell types but expression was highest on recruited neutrophils following zymosan challenge (Figure [1](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}D). In addition, we cultured BMDMs and HUVECs and challenged them with a range of inflammatory stimuli (Figures [1](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}E,F). Addition of zymosan, LPS, interferon-\u03b3, poly I:C all increased BMDM expression of *Ccrl2* with the combination of LPS and interferon-\u03b3 resulting in the largest increase in expression (\\~235-fold increase compared with vehicle) (Figure [1](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}E). Zymosan and LPS also increased *Ccrl2* expression in HUVECs (Figure [1](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}F). These results are in agreement with the published literature, indicating that *Ccrl2* expression is indeed rapidly upregulated on a number of cells during acute inflammation ([@B39], [@B40]).\n\n*Ccrl2*^\u2212*/*\u2212^ Mice Displayed Increased Monocyte and Neutrophil Recruitment to the Inflamed Peritoneum {#S3-2}\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo investigate the potential functional consequence of upregulation of Ccrl2 during acute inflammation *in vivo*, we challenged WT mice or *Ccrl2*^\u2212/\u2212^ mice with 100\u2009\u00b5g zymosan for 4\u2009h and quantified inflammatory cell recruitment and mobilisation. Zymosan challenge resulted in significantly more total cells recruited to the peritoneum of *Ccrl2*^\u2212^*^/^*^\u2212^ mice compared with WT after 4\u2009h (Figure [2](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}B). There was also a striking increase in monocyte recruitment (0.4\u2009\u00b1\u20090.05\u2009\u00d7\u200910^6^ in *Ccrl2*^\u2212/\u2212^ mice compared with 0.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.03\u2009\u00d7\u200910^6^ in WT mice) and neutrophil recruitment (6.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.52\u2009\u00d7\u200910^6^ in *Ccrl2*^\u2212/\u2212^ mice compared with 3.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.35\u2009\u00d7\u200910^6^ in WT mice) to the peritoneum of *Ccrl2*^\u2212^*^/^*^\u2212^ mice (Figures [2](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}A--D). Other cell populations including CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells and B cells were also quantified but no significant differences were observed between the two genotypes (data not shown).\n\n![Deletion of *Ccrl2* increased neutrophil mobilisation and recruitment to local sites of inflammation. 8- to 10-week-old male *Ccrl2*^\u2212^*^/^*^\u2212^ or age-matched littermate controls were injected with zymosan i.p. (100\u2009\u00b5g/animal), and 4\u2009h later, zymosan injected animals or steady state animals were sacrificed.

Similarly to the peritoneum, there was a twofold increase in blood neutrophils in *Ccrl2*^\u2212^*^/^*^\u2212^ mice challenged with zymosan compared with WT (Figure [2](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}E). There was also an increase in Ly6C^hi^ monocytes, although this was not significant (Figure [2](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}F). In agreement with the results from the peritoneum, there were no differences in circulating B cells, CD4 T cells or CD8 T cells between these genotypes (data not shown).\n\nSince we observed increased neutrophil and monocyte numbers in the peritoneum and blood of *Ccrl2*^\u2212^*^/^*^\u2212^ mice following zymosan challenge, we investigated if the increased numbers of systemic leucocytes was associated with differences in levels in the bone marrow (Figures [2](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}H--J). *Ccrl2*^\u2212^*^/^*^\u2212^ did not display any significant differences in total bone marrow neutrophils (Figure [2](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}H) monocytes (Figure [2](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}I) or B cells (Figure [2](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}J). Collectively, our results suggest that the elevated neutrophil levels observed in the peritoneum are the result of increased initial systemic inflammatory responses of *Ccrl2*^\u2212^*^/^*^\u2212^ mice.\n\nIntriguingly, Ccrl2 appears to be primarily important in the initial stages of the acute inflammatory response. When we investigated later time points following zymosan challenge (48\u2009h), we found no significant differences in neutrophil or monocyte numbers in the peritoneum or blood between *Ccrl2*^\u2212/\u2212^ mice and WT mice (Figures S2B,C,E,F in Supplementary Material). In addition, there were no significant differences in local or systemic chemerin levels at this late time point (Figures S2D,G in Supplementary Material).\n\nSteady State *Ccrl2*^\u2212*/*\u2212^ Mice Displayed No Obvious Alterations in Resident Leucocyte Populations in Any Tissues Examined {#S3-3}\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo establish whether the increased inflammatory cell recruitment observed in *Ccrl2*^\u2212^*^/^*^\u2212^ mice during zymosan challenge could be explained by increased circulating myeloid cells under resting conditions, we undertook a phenotypic analysis of the peritoneum, blood, bone marrow and spleen of unchallenged WT and *Ccrl2*^\u2212^*^/^*^\u2212^ mice (Figure [2](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}). We found no differences in neutrophils or monocytes between the two groups (Figures [2](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}C,D). There were no differences in Ly6C^hi^ monocytes, Ly6C^lo^ monocytes or neutrophils in the blood between the two groups (Figures [2](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}E--G). Similarly, there were no differences in monocytes, neutrophils or B cells in the bone marrow (Figures [2](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}H--J). Nor were there obvious differences in the spleens under homeostatic conditions (data not shown). Finally, we endeavoured to assay basal levels of CXCL1 and IL-6 in the peritoneal lavage fluid of these mice, but all samples tested were below the limit of detection (set at 15\u2009pg/ml) of the assays (data not shown). These results indicate that the increased neutrophil and monocyte recruitment to the peritoneum seen following zymosan challenge were due to differences in initial inflammatory responses rather than a constitutive increase in circulating neutrophil and monocyte numbers.\n\n*Ccrl2*^\u2212*/*\u2212^ Mice Displayed Increased CXCL1 and Chemerin Levels at Early Time Points following Zymosan Challenge {#S3-4}\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHaving shown that mice lacking the CCRL2 chemerin receptor displayed exaggerated acute inflammatory responses following zymosan challenge, we next investigated if the increased monocyte and neutrophil recruitment was due to elevated chemokine or inflammatory mediator levels. There were no significant differences in mediator levels between the two genotypes at the 4\u2009h time point (Table [1](#T1){ref-type=\"table\"}). However, a number of mediators including CXCL1 (an important neutrophil chemoattractant) and IL-6 displayed rapid induction following zymosan challenge peaking at 2\u2009h (Figures [3](#F3){ref-type=\"fig\"}A,B).\n\n###### \n\nLocal mediators (pg/ml) produced in peritoneal exudate cell fluid following 4\u2009h challenge with 100\u2009\u00b5g zymosan i.p. as measured by Luminex.\n\n                 IL-6        CCL2         CCL3          CCL4         CXCL1        CXCL2       CXCL10\n  -------------- ----------- ------------ ------------- ------------ ------------ ----------- ----------\n  Wild type      759\u2009\u00b1\u2009123   1,218\u2009\u00b1\u200981   34.50\u2009\u00b1\u20095.3   744.3\u2009\u00b1\u200941   78.6\u2009\u00b1\u20096.4   506\u2009\u00b1\u2009166   620\u2009\u00b1\u200950\n  *Ccrl2*^\u2212/\u2212^   705\u2009\u00b1\u200983    1,013\u2009\u00b1\u200921   26.40\u2009\u00b1\u20092.1   736.8\u2009\u00b1\u200932   127.8\u2009\u00b1\u200928   400\u2009\u00b1\u2009148   525\u2009\u00b1\u200924\n\n*Data are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM of n\u2009=\u20098 animals*.\n\n*Statistical significance was assessed by a Student's unpaired t-test, ns\u2009=\u2009P\u2009\\>\u20090.05*.\n\n![Increased neutrophil recruitment in *Ccrl2*^\u2212^*^/^*^\u2212^ mice was associated with increased CXCL1 and chemerin levels at early time points. **(A--C)** 8- to 10-week-old male C57BL/6J wild-type (WT) mice were injected with zymosan i.p.

Similar to the 4\u2009h time point, we observed significantly more neutrophils recruited to the peritoneum in the *Ccrl2*^\u2212^*^/^*^\u2212^ mice compared with WT (Figure [3](#F3){ref-type=\"fig\"}E). There were very few if any monocytes recruited to the peritoneum at this early time point (Figure [1](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}B). We observed a twofold increase in CXCL1 levels in the peritoneum of these animals as well as significantly elevated chemerin levels (Figures [3](#F3){ref-type=\"fig\"}F,G). Whilst we observed no obvious differences in monocyte or neutrophil numbers in the blood (Figures [2](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}H,I), there was a threefold increase in CXCL1 plasma levels (Figure [3](#F3){ref-type=\"fig\"}K).

Thioglycollate is a well-established inflammatory stimulus used to elicit inflammatory macrophages (after 4--5\u2009days) ([@B45], [@B52]). However, it can also be used to interrogate neutrophil recruitment in the initial stages of inflammation. Following a 1\u2009h challenge with 4% thioglycollate, we observed a small but distinct population of neutrophils recruited to the peritoneum (Figure [4](#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}A). We chose this time point because it represents an early stage of neutrophil recruitment in response to thioglycollate. *Ccrl2*^\u2212^*^/^*^\u2212^ mice displayed a twofold increase in neutrophil recruitment to the peritoneum compared with WT controls (0.07\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01\u2009\u00d7\u200910^6^ neutrophils in WT compared with 0.13\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01\u2009\u00d7\u200910^6^ neutrophils in *Ccrl2*^\u2212/\u2212^ mice) (Figure [4](#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}C).

This is perhaps not surprising given the early time point tested. There were, however, elevated chemerin levels in the blood of the *Ccrl2*^\u2212^*^/^*^\u2212^ mice compared with WT controls (Figure [4](#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}I). As we did not observe any differences in neutrophil numbers in the blood of these animals, it seems unlikely there would be changes in the bone marrow at this early time point but this was not assessed ([@B53]). Collectively, these observations demonstrate that mice lacking *Ccrl2* display exaggerated neutrophil recruitment to local sites of inflammation as well as elevated chemerin and CXCL1 levels irrespective of the stimulus used to elicit the response.\n\nNeutralisation of Endogenous Chemerin in *Ccrl2*^\u2212*/*\u2212^ Mice Abrogated the Exaggerated Inflammatory Phenotype {#S3-6}\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFrom our previous experiments, *Ccrl2*^\u2212^*^/^*^\u2212^ mice displayed increased myeloid cell recruitment in short-term models of acute inflammation. This was associated with elevated CXCL1 and chemerin levels. Given our group and others have identified the CCRL2 ligand chemerin, as an important modulator of inflammation and chemotaxis, it seemed plausible that the elevated levels of chemerin during acute inflammation in *Ccrl2*^\u2212^*^/^*^\u2212^ mice was responsible for the increased myeloid cell recruitment ([@B20], [@B21], [@B23]). To test this hypothesis, we used a blocking anti-chemerin antibody to neutralise endogenous chemerin levels in the *Ccrl2*^\u2212^*^/^*^\u2212^ mice before zymosan challenge (Figure [5](#F5){ref-type=\"fig\"}). We first confirmed that this antibody could indeed block signalling at the Cmklr1 receptor. Using Cmklr1 transfected CHO-K1 cells, we demonstrated that preincubation with the antibody efficiently blocked chemerin induced \u03b2-arrestin recruitment to Cmklr1 (Figure [5](#F5){ref-type=\"fig\"}A). We also tested the antibody in primary cells and confirmed that it effectively blocked chemerin-induced chemotaxis of biogel-elicited macrophages in a real-time chemotaxis system (Figure [5](#F5){ref-type=\"fig\"}B). Following a 24\u2009h pretreatment with isotype control or anti-chemerin antibody, *Ccrl2*^\u2212/\u2212^ mice were challenged for 4\u2009h with zymosan as before (Figure [5](#F5){ref-type=\"fig\"}C). Animals that received the anti-chemerin antibody displayed significantly less total leucocyte and neutrophil recruitment to the peritoneum compared with mice that received the isotype control (Figures [5](#F5){ref-type=\"fig\"}D,E; Figure S1 in Supplementary Material). There was no significant effect on monocyte recruitment (Figure [5](#F5){ref-type=\"fig\"}F). When we measured mediator levels in the peritoneum of these mice, we observed a twofold reduction in CXCL1 levels in the anti-chemerin treated mice compared with isotype control treated mice and no differences in IL-6 levels between the groups (Figures [5](#F5){ref-type=\"fig\"}G,H). These results indicate that the elevated chemerin levels observed in *Ccrl2*^\u2212^*^/^*^\u2212^ mice contribute to the exaggerated leucocyte recruitment as well as the elevated CXCL1 levels observed in these mice during acute inflammation.\n\n![Treatment with an anti-chemerin blocking antibody attenuated the exaggerated inflammatory responses observed in *Ccrl2*^\u2212^*^/^*^\u2212^ mice. **(A)** CHO-K1 cells stably transfected with murine Cmklr1 were plated out in a 96-well plate for 48\u2009h before stimulation.

This provides a possible mechanism by which the higher chemerin levels in *Ccrl2*^\u2212/\u2212^ mice could cause increased CXCL1 levels during an inflammatory response. To further investigate the role of chemerin in exacerbating inflammation in our model, we pretreated WT mice with recombinant murine chemerin (4\u2009\u00b5g/mouse) for 1\u2009h before zymosan challenge (Figures [6](#F6){ref-type=\"fig\"}A,B).

We did not observe any differences in monocyte recruitment between the groups (Figure [6](#F6){ref-type=\"fig\"}E). Importantly, injection of chemerin alone did not result in any neutrophil or monocyte recruitment (Figures [6](#F6){ref-type=\"fig\"}B--E). When we analysed the inflammatory exudate from these mice, we found that chemerin pretreated mice had significantly higher levels of CXCL1 and IL-6 (Figures [6](#F6){ref-type=\"fig\"}F,G). Mice that were treated with chemerin displayed a 2-fold and 2.6-fold increase in CXCL1 and IL-6 levels, respectively.

To test this, we used Bio-gel elicited PECs, which we recently demonstrated to be a mixture of inflammatory macrophages and neutrophils ([@B50], [@B51]). We first demonstrated that Bio-gel elicited neutrophils do not express the chemerin Cmklr1 receptor (Figure [7](#F7){ref-type=\"fig\"}A). Using the real-time chemotaxis platform, we demonstrated that deletion of CCRL2 had no appreciable effect on PEC migration towards chemerin, CCL5, CXCL1, or C5a, ruling out any direct effect of CCRL2 on cell migration (Figures [7](#F7){ref-type=\"fig\"}B--E).\n\n![Absence of *Ccrl2* had no effect on the migratory behaviour of leucocytes towards macrophage or neutrophil chemoattractants. 8- to 10-week-old male *Ccrl2*^\u2212^*^/^*^\u2212^ mice and age-matched littermate controls were injected i.p. with 2% Bio-gel (polyacrylamide beads) and sacrificed 4\u2009days later.

We report that Ccrl2 is expressed on resident peritoneal macrophages as well as recruited monocytes and neutrophils following zymosan challenge (Figure [1](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}D). Interestingly, the highest levels of expression appear to be on recruited neutrophils and this is in agreement with a recent report by Del Prete et al. ([@B56]). In addition, *Ccrl2* expression on macrophages and endothelial cells is increased after exposure to inflammatory stimuli. This is in agreement with published reports (Figures [1](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}E,F) ([@B39], [@B40]). After 4\u2009h of zymosan challenge we observed that mice lacking expression of the Ccrl2 chemerin receptor displayed a twofold increase in monocyte and neutrophil recruitment to the peritoneum (Figures [2](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}B,C). These effects of Ccrl2 were not localised only to the site of inflammation, as we also observed increased neutrophil numbers in the blood, suggesting more systemic effect (Figure [2](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}E). These systemic effects were predominantly associated with neutrophil recruitment as we did not observe significant differences in monocyte numbers in the blood or bone marrow (Figures [2](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}F,I). The fact that there were significant differences only in local monocyte numbers but not in systemic numbers may be a feature of the early time point evaluated here, as we know from our kinetic studies that monocyte numbers peak later (Figure [1](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}B). Importantly, at an earlier time point (2\u2009h) in which we could more easily evaluate cytokine and chemokine levels, we observed that mice lacking Ccrl2 displayed higher levels of CXCL1 in the peritoneum (Figure [3](#F3){ref-type=\"fig\"}F). The elevated levels of CXCL1 both locally and systemically would explain why the majority of differences we observe in the *Ccrl2*^\u2212/\u2212^ mice were in the context of neutrophil migration. This phenotype was consistently associated with higher endogenous levels of chemerin in *Ccrl2*^\u2212/\u2212^ mice and was abrogated after blocking chemerin activity with an anti-chemerin antibody (Figure [5](#F5){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Furthermore, this phenotype was recapitulated in WT mice by injection of recombinant murine chemerin, further indicating a role for chemerin in driving this exaggerated neutrophil recruitment (Figure [6](#F6){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Finally, this exaggerated inflammatory phenotype of *Ccrl2*^\u2212/\u2212^ mice appears to be predominantly associated with the initial stages of acute inflammatory responses. Absence of Ccrl2 did not appear to affect neutrophil or monocyte numbers locally or systemically at later time points (Figure S2 in Supplementary Material).\n\nCcrl2 is one of the less studied chemerin receptors and arguably performs the least obvious function. It binds chemerin but there is no reported downstream signalling upon receptor ligation in primary cells ([@B38], [@B39]). Whilst it was initially thought to serve a similar function to the decoy receptors ACKR1 (or DARC) and ACKR2 (or D6), which dampen inflammation by binding and internalising inflammatory chemokines, Ccrl2 does not internalise chemerin or any other chemokines ([@B38], [@B57]). Whilst the exact role of Ccrl2 during inflammation has yet to be fully elucidated, its expression has been documented by a number of groups including in this report (Figures [1](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}E,F) to be rapidly upregulated during inflammation, suggesting a conserved function required during inflammatory responses ([@B39], [@B40]).\n\nSeveral studies have endeavoured to clarify the role played by Ccrl2 *in vivo* but there have been conflicting results in different experimental models. Zabel et al. demonstrated that mice lacking Ccrl2 displayed reduced ear swelling and leucocyte influx in a mast cell dependent model of atopic allergy. The exact mechanism by which Ccrl2 modulated these responses was not clear. However, cells expressing Ccrl2 were shown to bind and concentrate chemerin locally *in vitro*. When these cells were incubated with *Cmklr1* transfected cells, they induced calcium flux, indicating a possible role for Ccrl2 in chemerin presentation ([@B38]). In the *in vitro* model, Ccrl2 expressing cells were capable of binding chemerin and presenting it to Cmklr1 expressing cells when in close proximity. It was postulated this mode of action played a role in mast cell responses to low dose IgE challenge. However, this seems unlikely to be the case in our model of acute inflammation. Administration of recombinant bioactive chemerin to WT mice exacerbated the acute inflammatory response (Figure [6](#F6){ref-type=\"fig\"}). If Ccrl2 were functioning to increase chemerin signalling, which appears to be pro-inflammatory here, one would expect to observe reduced inflammation following zymosan challenge in *Ccrl2*^\u2212/\u2212^ mice. Yet in Figures [2](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"} and [3](#F3){ref-type=\"fig\"}, we observed the converse. An alternative hypothesis, therefore, is that *in vivo*, increased expression of Ccrl2 on other cell types during inflammation such as vascular endothelial cells may enable binding of free chemerin, which in turn reduces systemic levels of chemerin ([@B39]). This would thereby decrease the chemerin available to interact with Cmklr1 expressing cells and therefore dampen the ensuing pro-inflammatory responses elicited by chemerin as described by Neves et al. ([@B55]).\n\nMazzon et al. reported that mice lacking Ccrl2 displayed exacerbated disease in a model of experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) as well as increased *Ccrl2* expression on mononuclear cells in WT mice during EAE ([@B58]). The authors reported that in mice lacking Ccrl2, T cells, and macrophages were further polarised towards an inflammatory phenotype during disease, but the mechanism by which deletion of the *Ccrl2* gene enhanced disease remained unexplained ([@B58]).\n\nAt the time of writing, the same group more recently reported a new study in which mice lacking Ccrl2 were protected in two murine models of arthritis in contrast to their previous study using the EAE model, highlighting the complexity of the chemerin/Ccrl2 axis ([@B56], [@B58]). Importantly, the authors report that the protective effect of deletion of *Ccrl2* in these models was due to defects in neutrophil recruitment and trafficking due to CXCR2 heterodimersastion with Ccrl2. These results seem to be at odds with our current findings but possibly reflect differences in the disease models used to interrogate this biology. The kinetics and disease pathology differ significantly between the acute models of inflammation used in our study and the more chronic disease models used by Del Prete et al. in their most recent report ([@B56]). Clearly, further studies will be necessary to clarify the exact role played by Ccrl2 during inflammation but it seems likely to be disease and even tissue specific ([@B59]).\n\nIn agreement with an earlier study by Monnier et al. who reported higher chemerin levels in the blood of *Ccrl2*^\u2212/\u2212^ mice following intranasal administration of LPS, we observed elevated chemerin levels in the blood of *Ccrl2*^\u2212/\u2212^ animals following zymosan and thioglycollate challenge (Figures [3](#F3){ref-type=\"fig\"} and [4](#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}) ([@B39]). In addition, using BMDMs from WT animals and HUVECs, we observed increased expression of *Ccrl2* mRNA after stimulation with inflammatory stimuli (up to \\~230-fold increase on BMDMs) (Figure [1](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}E). We also report increased neutrophil recruitment and CXCL1 levels both locally and systemically (Figures [2](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"} and [3](#F3){ref-type=\"fig\"}) in *Ccrl2*^\u2212^*^/^*^\u2212^ mice challenged with 100\u2009\u00b5g zymosan. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of such an observation. The increased neutrophil recruitment during acute inflammation in these mice can be at least partly explained by increased CXCL1 and chemerin levels. Previous studies from our lab and others have not detected the chemotactic chemerin receptor Cmklr1 on murine neutrophils ([@B23], [@B56], [@B60]). There has since been one report of murine neutrophils expressing Cmklr1; however, we failed to detect any Cmklr1 expression on murine neutrophils (Figure [7](#F7){ref-type=\"fig\"}A) ([@B35]). It seems unlikely, therefore, that the increased neutrophil recruitment we observed in our model is due to any direct chemotactic effects of chemerin on neutrophils. We did not observe any differences in migration between WT and *Ccrl2*^\u2212/\u2212^ cells in response any mediators tested in agreement with Del Prete et al. (Figures [7](#F7){ref-type=\"fig\"}C,D) ([@B56]). Importantly, the phenotype observed in *Ccrl2*^\u2212^*^/^*^\u2212^ mice is not related to the receptors that detect zymosan (dectin-1, TLR2/6) as we observed a similar phenotype with thioglycollate challenge, which is a more severe inflammatory insult ([@B61]). Our results support the hypothesis that Ccrl2 is important for regulating both local and systemic chemerin levels during an acute inflammatory response.\n\nThis exacerbated inflammatory response was not simply a feature of increased basal myeloid cell numbers, as we observed no differences in leucocyte populations between the two groups in any tissue tested under steady state conditions (Figure [2](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Rather, the increased myeloid cell recruitment in *Ccrl2*^\u2212^*^/^*^\u2212^ mice was associated with increased chemerin and CXCL1 levels both locally and systemically. Chemerin has previously been reported to induce pro-inflammatory signalling in microvascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells ([@B55]). Chemerin treatment increased mRNA expression of a number of pro-inflammatory mediators including CCL2, TNF-\u03b1, and VCAM-1 ([@B55]). Another study by Lin et al. demonstrated that chemerin administration to WT mice induced more severe inflammation in a model of DSS-induced colitis, which was characterised by increased inflammatory cytokines and an inhibition of M2 polarisation of resident macrophages ([@B62]). Taken together, these reports support our hypothesis that increased chemerin levels observed in the *Ccrl2*^\u2212^*^/^*^\u2212^ mice were responsible for increased myeloid cell recruitment *via* the increased production of inflammatory mediators such as CXCL1 during sterile peritonitis.\n\nWe confirmed the importance of chemerin in the phenotype of *Ccrl2*^\u2212^*^/^*^\u2212^ mice using an anti-chemerin polyclonal blocking antibody to inhibit chemerin signalling in these animals before zymosan challenge (Figure [5](#F5){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Neutralisation of endogenous chemerin in the *Ccrl2*^\u2212^*^/^*^\u2212^ mice decreased the total leucocytes and neutrophils recruited to the peritoneum compared with isotype controls, indicating that elevated chemerin levels did indeed play a role in the exaggerated neutrophil recruitment observed in these animals (Figures [5](#F5){ref-type=\"fig\"}C,D). We previously observed that blockade of endogenous chemerin in WT mice resulted in increased neutrophil and monocyte recruitment to the peritoneum of WT mice following challenge with 10\u2009\u00b5g zymosan ([@B34]). In our current study, we did not interrogate chemerin blockade in WT mice but when chemerin activity was blocked in *Ccrl2*^\u2212/\u2212^ mice during 100\u2009\u00b5g zymosan challenge, we observed decreased neutrophil recruitment compared with isotype control treated *Ccrl2*^\u2212/\u2212^ mice. These data highlight further differences in chemerin behaviour depending on the intensity of inflammatory insult and genetic backgrounds used. From the results in our current study, it is plausible that chemerin may be more important for driving neutrophil rather than monocyte recruitment in this acute model of inflammation, as chemerin blockade had no significant effect on monocyte numbers. However, it is known that neutrophils are important for the recruitment of monocytes during an inflammatory response and are capable of secreting a number of monocyte chemoattractants ([@B63], [@B64]). Chemerin bioactivity may not have been completely blocked in these animals, hence although we observed a significant decrease in neutrophil recruitment, this may not been sufficiently blunted to in turn appreciably decrease monocyte recruitment at this time point. When we interrogated mediator levels, we observed a significant decrease in local levels of CXCL1 but no change in IL-6 following blockade of endogenous chemerin (Figures [5](#F5){ref-type=\"fig\"}F,G). CXCL1 and IL-6 were evaluated as CXCL1 is a key driver of neutrophil recruitment and IL-6 is a systemic marker of inflammation ([@B65]--[@B68]).\n\nAs predicted from our results using chemerin blocking antibodies, chemerin pretreatment of WT mice before zymosan challenge increased total cell and neutrophil recruitment to the peritoneum as well as elevated levels of inflammatory chemokines and cytokines, similar to what we observed in the *Ccrl2*^\u2212^*^/^*^\u2212^ mice (Figure [6](#F6){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Importantly, injection of chemerin alone did not induce any neutrophil recruitment after 4\u2009h at the dose used (Figures [6](#F6){ref-type=\"fig\"}B--E). We demonstrate here that full-length bioactive chemerin can increase neutrophil recruitment when administered before an inflammatory stimulus but previous studies from our laboratory have reported that a synthetic chemerin-derived peptide called C15 has anti-inflammatory effects in a similar model (albeit using 10-fold lower dose of zymosan as an inflammatory stimulus) ([@B34]). The most likely explanation for this apparent discrepancy is differences in the pharmacology and downstream signalling between the full-length chemerin protein and the 15 amino acid chemerin peptide. The signalling cascades that are activated at the murine Cmklr1 receptor upon chemerin binding for example, are relatively well characterised (involving the MAP kinase, RhoA, ROCK, MEK1/2, and P38 proteins amongst others) ([@B23], [@B26]). However, very little if anything is known about the signalling pathways induced by the C15 peptide. Whilst chemerin is known to act as a potent chemoattactant for macrophages, DCs, and NK cells, C15 does not exhibit similar effects on any cell types investigated thus far ([@B20], [@B22], [@B23], [@B30], [@B50]). Clearly, the full-length protein and the smaller peptide elicit quite different intracellular signalling pathways downstream of the Cmklr1 chemerin receptor and this would suggest they play quite different roles *in vivo*.\n\nWe have endeavoured to confirm the requirement for CXCL1 in the exaggerated neutrophil recruitment in *Ccrl2*^\u2212/\u2212^ mice by pretreating WT and *Ccrl2*^\u2212/\u2212^ mice with a blocking anti-CXCL1 antibody before zymosan challenge. However, we did not observe significant decreases in neutrophil recruitment in either group despite previous reports (data not shown) ([@B65]). However, these results are perhaps not surprising given the high affinity of these chemokines for their receptors as well as the functional redundancy in the system ([@B69]). Hence, we have demonstrated that chemerin is elevated in *Ccrl2*^\u2212/\u2212^ mice and that elevated chemerin is capable of driving the exaggerated neutrophil recruitment and increased levels of CXCL1 during acute inflammation. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that other mediators or pathways are also involved. Further studies will be required to fully clarify this.\n\nIn summary, we have demonstrated that the non-signalling chemerin receptor Ccrl2 serves a non-redundant role in dampening acute inflammatory responses *in vivo*. The absence of Ccrl2 resulted in exaggerated acute inflammatory responses as well as elevated CXCL1 and chemerin levels. Blockade of endogenous chemerin in *Ccrl2*^\u2212^*^/^*^\u2212^ mice abrogated the elevated neutrophil recruitment. We observed that administration of recombinant murine chemerin to WT mice induced similar exaggerated inflammatory responses to those seen in *Ccrl2*^\u2212^*^/^*^\u2212^ mice. Importantly, deletion of the *Ccrl2* gene did not have any direct effect on myeloid cell chemotaxis towards chemerin or other chemokines. Our data are consistent with a model in which Ccrl2 serves to bind and maintain chemerin levels below a pathological threshold during acute inflammation and the more severe inflammatory responses observed in *Ccrl2*^\u2212^*^/^*^\u2212^ mice are due to significantly elevated free chemerin levels. The increased chemerin signalling in turn induces higher production of inflammatory chemokines such as CXCL1, which results in elevated myeloid cell recruitment and more severe inflammation. Our experiments suggest that chemerin could be a therapeutic target in the treatment of inflammatory diseases, particularly RA, in which chemerin has consistently been implicated in the pathology of this disease ([@B16], [@B19], [@B54], [@B70]).\n\nEthics Statement {#S5}\n================\n\nAll animal studies were conducted with ethical approval from the Dunn School of Pathology Local Ethical Review Committee and in accordance with the UK Home Office regulations (Guidance on the Operation of Animals, Scientific Procedures Act, 1986).\n\nAuthor Contributions {#S6}\n====================\n\nDR-K, SV, CR, LT, TK, DG, and AI performed experiments; DR-K, SV, and AI analysed results and made the figures; DR-K, SV, AI, and DG designed the research and wrote the paper.
