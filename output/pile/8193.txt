Monday, ... more Photo: Tyler Sizemore / Hearst Connecticut Media Photo: Tyler Sizemore / Hearst Connecticut Media Image 1 of / 15 Caption Close Greenwich High students hear from LGBTQ adults for diversity week 1 / 15 Back to Gallery\n\nGREENWICH \u2014 Barbara Curry has an app on her phone that tells her where it is safe to pee. When she is not in Connecticut, she checks it before any trip to a public bathroom.\n\nThat\u2019s because in many states, which door she chooses \u2014 men\u2019s or women\u2019s \u2014 could lead to her arrest.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had to deal with a lot of situations where I walk into something not knowing what the risks are,\u201d she said, \u201cboth professionally and individually.\u201d\n\nCurry is transgender. She presents as a tall, broad shouldered woman with shiny, brown hair.\n\nOn Monday, Curry was one of three guests invited to speak to Greenwich High students as part of the school\u2019s Diversity Awareness Week.\n\nCurry has been a member of the Connecticut-based LGBT activist group Stonewall Speakers for 20 years. She was joined by two other Stonewall Speakers, Stamford resident and business consultant Bernie Kettle and UConn student Jacob Griffith Gardner, both gay men, to share their stories, answer student questions and discuss the impact of the Trump administration on the LGBT community.\n\nTo an audience of more than 100, Curry, who was born male, explained that her identification as a woman was something innate.\n\n\u201cSince the day I was born and my parents were handed a baby boy, I wanted a second opinion,\" she said. \u201cBy the age of 5, I knew I was different but I didn't have a vocabulary; I had no way to tell people what it was about me that was different from everybody else.\"\n\nAs a young boy growing up in Fairfield, Conn., Curry wanted to wear dresses and regularly tried on her sister and mother\u2019s clothing.\n\n\"Even time I did it, I had this moment of euphoria and then immediately would get a tidal wave of guilt and shame,\" she said.\n\nCurry kept her gender questioning under wraps through high school and college, presenting as a \u201cthe most normative white straight guy that anybody could ever expect\u201d until after she graduated.\n\nIn her 20s, Curry felt compelled to come out to a girl she was dating. In a three-hour conversation, struggling to find words to sum up what she had felt for so long, she explained she was a male who identified as female and was sexually attracted to women. Her date was accepting. The pair have been married for more than 35 years.\n\nCurry said since that time, some things have gotten easier.\n\n\u201cI never thought I would have a U.S. court make a ruling that says I am entitled to use the bathroom of least astonishment,\" she said. \"I didn\u2019t think there would be executive orders from the White House saying transgender kids should be allowed to use the bathrooms they want.\u201d\n\nBut some of the advances that the LGBT community has won are disappearing under the Trump presidency, she said.\n\nJust last week, the President revoked Obama-era guidelines to public schools that let transgender students use the bathroom of their choice, leaving it up to states to decide whether students must use the bathroom matching the sex on their birth certificate.\n\nNext month, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear the case of Gavin Grimm, a 17-year-old transgender student from Virginia who sued his school board for a policy that required students to use the bathroom that corresponds with their biological sex or a separate single-stall restroom.\n\n\u201cChange doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be drastic, but it has to be justifiable and equal,\" said Curry.\n\nAt Greenwich High, students may use a bathroom of the gender they identify with, said Headmaster Chris Winters. The school also have single occupancy bathrooms for students wishing that accommodation.\n\nThe Stonewall Speakers, Curry, Griffith Gardner and Kettle, said that some of the hope they felt during the presidency of Barack Obama is now gone.\n\n\u201cThe people who have been appointed to positions lately are people that stand very vehemently and strongly against our community and have pledged to do things like re-recognize on a federal level conversion therapy, which is basically ... a form of torture trying to break people down so much that they are OK with not recognizing a part of who they are,\" said Griffith Gardner. \u201cThat is something that our current Vice President supports. That\u2019s something that takes a lot of hope away.\u201d\n\nNeither the Office of the Vice President nor the White House Press Corps responded for comment by press time.\n\nThe LGBT community battles hundreds of years of mistrust of \u201csexual variance\u201d stemming back to the time when men were burned at the stake for sodomy, Griffith Gardner said.\n\nPrejudice against gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender and queer people finds its roots in history, he said.\n\nExplaining his own journey with sexual orientation, Griffith Gardner emphasized the \u201csheer terror\u201d he felt when coming out even to his best friend.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t comfortable coming out to them simply because of all of the negative things that have been said about the gay community around me,\" he said.\n\nGriffith Gardner was assaulted three times during middle and high school in Madison, Conn., by students who called him a \u201cfaggot\u201d for being gay. Last year at the Univeristy of Connecticut, he gave some male students a ride home from a party and when they arrived at their destination, they harassed him, hit his car and prevented him from driving away until Griffith Gardner called the police.\n\nGriffith Gardener felt scared to leave his room for the next few days and when he eventually tried to go to class, the sight of cars gave him a panic attack that left him crying and unresponsive on the floor. He was hospitalized and took a semester-long leave of absence from the school, he said.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a nationally representative study of adolescents in grades seven to 12 found that lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth were more than twice as likely to have attempted suicide as their heterosexual peers.\n\nGriffith Gardner said more than three quarters of his LGBT friends in high school had attempted self-harm.\n\nGriffith Gardner, Curry and Kettle highlighted the importance of being an ally, a straight person supporting an LGBT person or community, for struggling LGBT people, particularly under the new administration.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of work to be done,\u201d said Griffith Gardner. \u201cIt is something that requires the allies to help us get through it.\"\n\nMonday\u2019s panel of Stonewall Speakers was part of the school\u2019s annual Diversity Awareness Week, which brings speakers and presentations surrounding the theme of inclusion to GHS.\n\nWinters said the school has held Diversity Awareness Week for more than a decade.\n\n\u201cWe have a mission to respect and celebrate our differences and to support an inclusive and tolerant environment,\u201d he said. \u201cDiversity Week challenges our thinking and assumptions. It makes us ask questions of ourselves and our school community. I believe it is an essential part of the GHS experience.\u201c\n\nGarfield Charles, English teacher and assistant dean for Cantor House, organized Diversity Awareness Week this year.\n\n\u201cEspecially this year, in terms of everything that is happening around us, I think there is this need to really respect individuals around us and know that we each have a voice,\u201d said Charles. \u201cI think kids are recognizing the importance of that as a community.\u201d\n\nemunson@greenwichtime.com; Twitter: @emiliemunson"
