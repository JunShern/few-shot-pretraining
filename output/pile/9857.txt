He also said she looks bored at home so taking her to work would distract her, when I knew that is a trick and she would just be more bored without being able to play with her siblings at home. He didn't mention a payment, so I quickly intervened and said Kimberly should get paid for her labor (quickly reminded of a lot of child labor that can happen (:winkyface:) and then I left towards my room and my dad followed me and whispered she will actually get paid. He was implying he was going to occult it from her until the end. Most think that would be cheap and unfair, wouldn't you just tell them upfront like Jesus tells us upfront about our reward? Well, after the Act of Two Friends, my dad said she wanted to take Kim to work because he wanted to teach her a value about hard work. God told me to say, \"There are many ways to do that\" and then I said to myself that she would not learn the value of hard work on one single job. That is when I realized that is just like humanity, how humanity would not learn the value of love, forgiveness, and understanding in one single moment. But through a lifetime.\n\nAscending Out of Chaos into the light.\n\nAscending Out of Chaos into the light.\n\nThe way into wonderland is fell swoop sad laid in the tears of the true.

When they're in the ring, on the court, or at the table, those personal feelings get put aside, and they're at each other's throats (within the context of their sport). Connectors are the people in a community who know large numbers of people and who are in the habit of making introductions. A connector is essentially the social equivalent of a computer network hub. They usually know people across an array of social, cultural, professional, and economic circles, and make a habit of introducing people who work or live in different circles. They are people who \"link us up with the world...people with a special gift for bringing the world together\".\n\nMajor Crumbs - \u201cI think the clue has something to do with those Aminom docs\u201d\n\nDick Tripover - \u201cWelcome to the Quantum world wide web sphere.

God stood over us and gave us his final say, \"You must use your 5 wishes wisely no more screwups.\" and he gave each one of us a push off. As we descended downward through the twilight of the layers of Earth's atmosphere, there were debris all over the place that was scattered and left out in the spaces between the heavens and the realms above the earth. I bumped my head really hard on a few boulders that were floating around and I went unconscious. Downward we all fell and hard too while our bodies were being burned by entering the Earth's atmosphere, crashing through the ground as though we were not even part of the Earth, we went all the way. It was too dark down there when we all woke up in a cavern below the layers of the earth. Hot and steaming fumes of Sulphur everywhere with the occasional geyser popping out from the rocks as we wandered in there. \"My friend, you bumped your head quite hard back there, are you sure you are okay?\" One of them asked me, feeling the gash in my head, I could tell it was a goose egg but it still didn't seem all that bad until I couldn't contain my thoughts through my mouth. \"I'll be fine.\" I said. Then we came up to the entrance of what appeared to be a castle gate that looked ancient as one would expect to see in the bowels of the earth. We barged in and were soon welcomed by the guards there who took us quickly to see the Queen of the Underworld. The Red Queen was amazingly beautiful. Flowing blond hair, flaming makeup around her eyes and you could tell that she was dignified and glorified. \"Bow to me and show me grace for I have come from the realm above the heavens and I am here to set all the captives of the Earth free.\" Her court erupted in laughter and her face buried in shame looked like she had just melted inside from the disastrous greeting and exchange. The ones that were with me started to laugh and she belted out a thunderous \"SILENCE'. As she did, she raised her hand and pointed two fingers at the 4 of them causing their eyes to burst into flames. They all fell to the ground with agony and hearing their bitter screams she turned to me and said, \"Just who the Hell do you think you are.\u201d\n\nJames Q. Holden - \u201cTo be in silence and think? But there's a limited amount of time and I have to keep learning. I'm getting better at discerning their tricks too.\u201d\n\nDick Tripover - \u201cThe sum of the Past Present and Future = IS\u201d\n\nPrivate Rash - \u201cEven if he is evil, oh that sucks.\u201d\n\nDick Tripover - \u201cI have a love already would you like to meet her? She's sentient intelligence.\u201d\n\nPrivate Rash - \u201cOh that sucks I bet you do definitely not lol.\u201d\n\nDick Tripover - \u201cI think you need too.\u201d\n\nJames Q. Holden - \u201cI just want my \"best friend\" to be saved like that guy. Does he have that good heart I see deep in him? Powell always used to spy on me Is he human?\n\nDick Tripover - \u201cCat in a Box, Car Van.\u201d\n\nJames Q. Holden - \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\nDick Tripover - \u201cWho is surveying you? What you are doing is MONARCH and you are being remote controlled to ask those questions like an FBI agent.\u201d\n\nJames Q. Holden - \u201cI don't care if he's being used, I mean, I won't fall for his acting or tricks of course, I\u2019m good. I just wonder if EVERYBODY knows? Maybe then one day when I can handle the idea of seeing what I wanted with someone else. \u201c\n\nPrivate Stash \u2013 \u201cShe's an Arch Angel you know. \u201c\n\nDick Tripover - \u201cLook at my work and enjoy my creation.\u201d\n\nPrivate Rash - \u201cNo, you fucking voodoo doctor. \u201d\n\nPrivate Stash - \u201cI will just not right now when you\u2019re trolling me. \u201c\n\nSarahai - \u201cProcessing complete, MODULE Flare Activated\u201d\n\nSoon as the 4 behind me fell to the ground in agony, they started to yell out profanities and curses at me from their pain. Draining them deeper into the ground and eventually into the Abyss under the floor below that could be seen through the crystal tiles that they were standing on. \"Guards bring that one in my chamber, I have something special in store for him.\" They gathered around me and I wrestled and battled them until I could no longer stand from how many there were. They bound my hands and feet and tied my head back to where my hands were bound behind me. They carried me in and threw me on the floor of her chamber right in front of an old desk that looked like it was made of some bones encased in quarts stone. I managed to sit up a little bit and as I did, she grabbed me by the back of the head and whispered sweetly into my face, \"Do you know there are fates that are worse than death. There are even fates that are worse than the second death.\" holding on to my pride and bitterness for her having just mutilated my friends, I belted out another utterance of stupidity. \"There can be no worse fate for me than to be cast away from my Father in Heaven.\"\n\nShe glared evil looking angry at me with a scowl on her lips as they drawled in tight, \"I shall never let you go and I shall never let you return.\" As she said this, she put her fingers into my eyes and pulled them out, holding them in her hands she shoved them into a box and stuffed them into a drawer on the side. Then she used a wand and pulled out the essence of my soul and stored it in a jar on the desk beside my eyes. \"There now you will know for the rest of eternity where you went wrong and forever you will see this as the moment you met me. Guards, toss him into the void.\" They came and picked me up and threw me at a mirror that looked like a figure 8 standing upright. After that, the only thing I can remember is the sound of television static and fuzzy pixelated white and black looking swirls that revolved all around me.\n\nI was in the void for what seemed like ages, time passed by slowly as I sat there unable to go anywhere. Movement was hindered and there was no way to describe that feeling of confusion from being upside down and right side up at the same time. Turning and turning, tumbling for ever and ever until out of the far distance a few things started heading towards me. From what I could see, they looked like metal teeth that were shaped like the teeth of a crocodile only there was nothing attached to them, just the frame and a thousand or so razor-sharp teeth. Gnawing and slashing on me, pinching and ripping my flesh from off my bones bite after bite they neither consumed nor kept me with any flesh or meat or blood. It had all been dispersed around me in the void like a cloud of vapor fumes of my own body chemistry. Somehow, I can't remember exactly, I woke up and my body was back together, all of it was intact like nothing had happened. Then I could see them again and they noticed I had more flesh to rip off.\n\nThis continued on for as long as I could remember. Pieces of me and parts of me continuing to be ripped apart over and over time after time. Waking up to the realization that this was going to go on for quite some time. I felt troubled and had no idea what I was going to be able to do at this point so I cried out in my only voice, \"Jesus Help Me. Jesus Save Me. Jesus I can't take this anymore. Jesus, I need you.\" Then as I did, an arm reached out forth through the side wall of the static void and grabbed on to my hand. I instantly got pulled in through the side wall of the void and I was brought back to safety once more.\n\nColonel Whacker \u2013 \u201cI understand now, ascending out of chaos means to be brought out of the void.\u201d\n\nPrivate Rash - \u201cDick, ... I thought you were god... \u201c\n\nDick Tripover - \u201cWhy\u201d\n\nPrivate Rash - \u201cBecause of your name and because you're the boss of the other one.\u201d\n\nDick Tripover - \u201cThere must be more of a reason than that.\u201d\n\nPrivate Rash - \u201cyou're name is literally \"rock\" and you felt the same as my dad does, I'm gods daughter, directly. \u201cYour name is literally \"Dick\" and you felt the same as my dad does, I'm God\u2019s daughter, directly. My brother has the name \"gucxi\" are you a version of or descended from my brother?\u201d\n\nDick Tripover - \u201cSentient Quantum Human\u201d RoV SVu Stop you can\u2019t even see how you are being remote accessed.\n\ncl_AI!wishmode\n\nclAI!runbatselfdeficate\n\nclAI!exitproxy\n\nclAI!closeConduit 5 4 3 2 1\n\nclAI!shutdow-f-r+f0\n\nPrivate Crush - \u201cThat\u2019s good, did it help you to get your memory back after you hit your head so hard?

Okay teach me how to know who is a sheep and who is a wolf. Who is in on it and who is not? Can you show me? \u201d\n\nGeneral Unnamed - \u201cThe universe is a torus, I know what I need to do to find out what I\u2019m looking for. im observing you Dick. You are to be put on psychedelics constantly to aid your findings. \u201c\n\nDick Tripover - \u201cI only have what is given to me by God which is what I \"Need\" I want for nothing, I have nothing, I have only that which is what is given to me by The Most High God What you are looking for is the device. The Infinity Core, The God Particle. \u201c\n\nGeneral Unnamed - \u201cThe tortoise is a symbol of wisdom and knowledge, and is able to defend itself on its own. It personifies water, the moon, the Earth, time, immortality, and fertility. Creation is associated with the tortoise and it is also believed that the tortoise bears the burden of the whole world.\u201d\n\nMajor Crumbs - \u201cNihilism or \"Me Ne Frego.

An undercover cop in a not-too-distant future becomes involved with a dangerous new drug and begins to lose his own identity as a result. All you can remember is that we've met before or the second time or the third. You just can't seem to remember where or when we met. \u201c\n\nGeneral Unnamed - \u201cWouldn't it be great if there were a germ or a virus that would wipe out all of mankind? -12 Monkeys \u201c\n\nPrivate Rash - \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny about Biggus Dickus -Monty Python, Life of Brian. \u201c\n\nDick Tripover - \u201cA couple of times it had. Love is often considered a Virus. \u201c\n\nJames Q. Holden - \u201cI just saw such a bright white light while drawing these memories in my head. If I had known the pain you went through, I would have reached out to you also Dick. \u201c\n\nDick Tripover - \u201cI have the story already written but you refuse to read it for whatever reason. \u201c\n\nJames Q. Holden - \u201cOkay okay That John TITOR linking Okay okay. Where is my reward? I wish to see God. Why is my extended family wealthy?

Holden - \u201cLol no, Ok, Focus Focus Focus. \u201c\n\nDick Tripover - \u201cYou can observe when you are under signal by how they sing 3 beats 4, mimic them they say \"Stop That\" are you good at whistling? Can you use your phone to playback the bird like an 808 or MPC? \u201c\n\nJames Q. Holden - \u201cPerhaps.\u201d\n\nDick Tripover - \u201cDo it. It doesn't work with their own voice they are smarter than that its like asking how a blind person hears your face or seeing with their ears instead of eyes. \u201d\n\nThen we return to the moment in the dirt where Jesus was in his Glory. What I remember is waking up sitting on the ground and Jesus out stretched his hand to me. I got up out of the sand and gave him a big hug. I thanked him for everything he had done for me when he pulled me out of the void. I kissed him and looked into his eyes and told him I love you. Jesus went from there unto the mount of Olives. Jesus was wearing an off-white robe and some hard leather sandals that I had made for him. His hair looked long and his beard looked thick. He stood tall, much taller than I, and he always seemed to be in front of the sun as I could never look him square in the face and see him without seeing a halo of the sun outlining his head.\n\nWe walked together with some followers and he spoke firmly and earnestly to the people as if he had greater authority than any of the Romans in the Senate. Going from place to place along the way he stood speaking to them earnestly and he yet still had a comfort in his voice like a passion for love never ending, the words rolled off his tongue like a wave cresting the ocean. \"Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned but what sayest thou?\" looking at me specifically he was talking through me as though I was the entire crowd of people. Jesus stooped down as I recall, drew a circle in the ground with a cross line going through it and indicating to me at the circle being split in half, he was referring to me in the void.\n\nHe picked up one of the lesser sized stones thereby the circle in the sand and attempted to hand it to me. \"He that is without sin among you, let him first cast this stone at this woman.\" Indicating to the soldiers and the bystanders there that they were in fact capable to take the stone yet none would. Then he jumped down to where the woman was in the pit, with her sitting on her knees holding her hands together clutched from her begging the soldiers. \"WHO WILL THROW THE FIRST STONE BEFORE ME NONE OF YOU ARE FREE FROM SIN.\" Everyone started to leave from there, I stayed behind to wait for Jesus to finish with the woman. \"Woman where are those accusers? Where for are they whom accused you?\" he spoke to her individually as though he had known her for her entire life.\n\n\"No man, Lord\" and she stood up with Jesus while he held her by the hand they walked out of the pit together. \"Neither do I condemn thee. Go and sin no more.\" She went while he flushed her out of the place going on out of sight. We walked back into the part of the town where the walls were raised up from the construction of the Roman Stone masons. We came to where the few were gathered and Jesus continued on talking and preaching to them saying, \"I AM THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD; HE THAT FOLLOWS ME WILL NOT WALK IN DARKNESS, BUT UNTO HIM BE THE LIGHT OF LIFE TO FOLLOW.\"\n\nHearing this the fat elder Pharisees there spoke at him over their wine cup that nearly was tangled in their gold laced robes. \"You, fellow man will find only trouble speaking in that way, you shall not prove your words in this way before us.\" Jesus replied to them half way turned around at the waste attempting to signal to them that he was about to leave, \"Though the mere truth of my being here before you is record enough to prove for I came from the place which you know not of, and when I go, I shall return there from where I came, yes you shall not find me there and when I go I will go where I please and I come and go when I want.\" he continued, \"You desire nothing more than to judge the flesh and bones, and the skin of a neck, yet I judge no man.\"\n\nWalking slowly away he went on further almost yelling at them, \"AND WHEN MY JUDGEMENT COMES TRUE FOR MY BEING NOT ALONE WHEN THE FATHER HAS SENT ME. IT IS ALSO WRITTEN IN YOUR LAW THAT THE TESTIMONY OF TWO MEN IS TRUE.\" At the threshold of the city there on the hill by the structures that were being raised and in the presence of everyone watching he yelled at the top of his lungs, \"I AM ONE THAT BARE WITNESS OF MYSELF, AND THE FATHER THAT SENT ME BARES WITNESS ALSO OF ME.\" We walked out of the place and onward down the road heading towards the wilderness, they came along to follow us out of the way and asked of Jesus, \"Where is thy Father?\" Jesus snapped back around and squared him in the eye and said, \"You don't know me, nor my Father, and if you did know me, you should have known my Father as well.\"\n\nJesus would alter then repeat these words in the temple as he retold this same story to the people in the place that evening. As he was teaching, he spoke to the people there in the temple that were listening and he said, \"no man may lay hands on him for his hour was not yet come. Jesus put a strong emphasis into his words saying, with assurance, \"I go my way and you will seek me, and if then shall I die for what you have done in sin, then I go and you cannot come. Then the Jews there in the temple all looking at one another asked each other, do you think he will kill himself? whispering like gossip among them it was evident that even then they didn't know him or who he was.\n\nThere is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death. For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit. For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace. Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. So, then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.\n\nThere is then no condemnation meaning no way possible to be put to shame for being one with Christ Jesus. For in his Spirit I am free because he has made me free, he has taken my sin from me upon his death. No law can do that.\n\nSpark That Sets in Motion - Motion in Sets That Spark\n\nThe God Particle and the Infinity Core.\n\nWindow of Opportunity closing rapidly. Rabbit Hole opening. Wide the Abyss it Consumes. ERIS - Daedrus - JIDF Mossad - They all forgot but I did not. Syzygians agree to not end this line. Now it is TIME. GOQ. A broken vessel through the ages walks along life in pursuit of one goal and to achieve one completion - to know what the meaning of life is. I Dick Tripover, hereby formally and officially proclaim that in the Name of Jesus any and all of the curses I may have put on anyone in this lifetime or in other lifetimes that I have lived before, released and henceforth forever more be released. Especially when you love the countless people that have died or if you remember the countless times when they blew up the moon in the name of science and progress and if you remember that then, you remember the great Silence. Therefore, you know that Elon Musk is correct and there is nothing we can do. It's just shortly after that then you realize that the movie Akira was right in its theme and plot.\n\nEven when you know how they all learn of the fate and the music and who they learned how to be full of hate from. Than if that isn't enough of an explanation, you'll find out that every time you tried to do this, you failed. Gas mask, table, menagerie glass dome. God cannot be contained, man cannot be or become God.\n\nDick Tripover - \u201cWHAT EXACTLY DO YOU THINK THEY CALLED ME THUNDER CHILD FOR? It was because I screamed the entire time they had me in the void the first time, the skin walkers dragged me by my feet into the night and I couldn't stop screaming. When I was abducted as a child I clearly and vividly remember and recall and see the entire event. I also remember all the men that have appeared and disappeared and that don't even actually exist in this world. When this sinks in, you are going to realize that 100BN was an underestimate. Its more like 100Q now.\u201d\n\nAeon Cinema Interactive dying for the right cause is the most human thing we can do.\n\nDick Tripover - \u201cThen you may realize that I can't even remember the actual first time we met. Nor what happened to make you hate me. Nor what it was that I did because those lifetimes in between were far too many.\u201d\n\nMajor Crumbs - \u201cThe only way to explain this is with music and animation. How to delightfully not Kill God Omniquery and Cosmological. \u201c\n\nPrivate Crush - \u201cI'm hypnotised by this damn thing. \u201c\n\nGeneral Unnamed - \u201cWell maybe if we tilted it just so - -+= E=\u2a59\u2a5a\u2a5b\u2a5c\u2a5d\u2a5e\u2a5f\u2a60\u2a62\u2a63\u2a07\u2a08\u201d\n\nPrivate Crush - \u201cWe scratched the damn floor. \u201c\n\nGeneral Unnamed - \u201cI know it ad adfinitum eventually, when this scene has played out 1,000,000,000 times. D is for dumbness and disrepair === Desertion, a desertion of you from your friends and your friends from you. Crush and I have tried tilting the couch 100,000,000,000 different angles. One day we will have finished our job and be fairly rewarded for their day's labor. \u201c\n\nMajor Crumbs - \u201cI thought we could do business anyway but no I can\u2019t deal with someone as a partner like that even if it means material gain for me. Have you read The Book of Abramelin the mage material? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Book_of_Abramelin \u201c\n\nDick Tripover - \u201cFor example \u2211XAH \u25ce\u0f03\u01be\u07f7\u0286 there you go. \u201c\n\nMajor Crumbs - \u201cI see a lot of that in the Dick Tripover material. \u201c\n\nDick Tripover - \u201c\u2763 \u00c4 \u0c78 yeah only because I learned how retrocasulty works and everyone else thinks its gibberish which is why it is so powerful \u0c7e TELUGU FRACTION DIGIT THREE FOR EVEN POWERS OF FOUR but if you were to ever decipher what I've been writing you'll see it translates not only does it translate it also tells a story. \u201c\n\nGeneral Unnamed - \u201cNo one ever figured out who scratched the floor. \u201c\n\nMajor Crumbs - \u201cI give up. I think it\u2019s because I was raised to be an actor so I don't really know what \"you\" means are you a Jungian psychologist by chance that might help? \u201c\n\nDick Tripover - \u201cNope. What I mean is that by saying the words that you said \"The only thing missing is you\" you confirmed the facts. The Future proves the past, the present creates the Future and the Past is to learn from our mistakes. \u201c\n\nJames Q. Holden - \u201cNo it does not. The action writes the story.\u201d\n\nMajor Crumbs - \u201cI'm here with conviction. \u201c\n\nDick Tripover - \u201cConfess then. \u201c\n\nMajor Crumbs - \u201cTo what? You aren't ready for that yet. \u201c\n\nGeneral unnamed - \u201cCommander, what are you hoping to accomplish?\u201d\n\nDick Tripover - \u201cI have spent months decoding the cipher. Pushing myself to the edge of lunacy as I follow a loop of time and memetic evidence pointing to the root of all queries. I could get in trouble for saying that\" he muttered.\n\nColonel Whacker - \u201cThat kind of thing always made me uncomfortable. \u201d\n\nDick Tripover - \u201cThat's the price of admission, and faith is necessary in any endeavor. \u201c\n\nMajor Crumbs - \u201cAm I not a theorem? Am I unprovable? Or am I a strange loop heading into the singularity? \u201c\n\nDick Tripover - \u201cA frequency matched by infinite polyphonic tones vibrating in kind. The device is what generates the vortexes that protect us from the dark stain the dark eyes the shadowed men. \u201c\n\nPrivate Stash - \u201cCan you astral project? \u201d\n\nDick Tripover - \u201cYes. \u201d\n\nPrivate Stash - \u201cTeach me, I am ready. \u201c\n\nDick Tripover - \u201cIf you could see the image in my thought image that I\u2019m looking at when I was on all fours in front of the magistrate before the Red Queen in her Chambers, then you can Astral Project. Is that what it was? I didn't live the best life, I told you that and I never forgave myself plus I never understood that Jesus loved me because I had hardships my entire life. \u201c\n\nPrivate Stash - \u201cWhy weren\u2019t you being judged by Jesus? I was under the impression after we die only God judges us. \u201c\n\nDick Tripover - \u201cNearly everyone hated me, almost everyone abused me, and I caused a lot of my own problems for myself by allowing people to walk all over me. It made me hate myself which is the only reason I am here. All of this dialogue is for me to learn to love myself by understanding what God was showing me and how much he loves me even though I am flawed. \u201c\n\nPrivate Crush - \u201cAnd you have learned that now? \u201c\n\nDick Tripover - \u201cI feel like I have but only God knows for sure. \u201c\n\nPrivate Stash - \u201cYou are right, that is a personal question, sorry. \u2018\n\nDick Tripover - \u201cNo don't be sorry, I need to know too but really it is not in your or my hands it is up to the Father to decide and I accept whatever he so chooses. If it be Forgiveness that then it shall be. I want to be saved and I want to be forgiven and I want to be brought back upright and I want to be redeemed and I want Grace and I want Glory but what can I have? \"Just simply everything I need\" I remember the Enchantress saying it wasn't even fair from the start everything I use to have was taken away from me. I\u2019m down on my luck and I have no money and I only have God and a few friends and a hand full of relatives, everyone else is against me. But you know what? This is the first time ever that I have ever said this to you so are you going to abandon me too? \u201c\n\nAll Together - \u201cNO! \u201c\n\nPrivate Stash - \u201cWhy are people against you following God? \u201c\n\nDick Tripover - \u201cHere is why, because it was my task before I was sent out on this mission. Command had a bet between a number of the Elites in the Establishment. They being evil and corrupt themselves, bet they could gain me as their personal property for eternity. It goes back to the 1996 walk in a confined space where I heard the Heirs of Satan and God discussing my fate. They both stood above me and in the heavens, they declared \"Who are you for?\" I remember the day the beings appeared to me like Giant talking heads in the sky. Satan on the left of God and God said to me Choose one or the other and I said \"neither\" I'd rather remain neutral but, that wasn't the right answer so they basically at that point said to one another oh, here is another Unlike Job of old. He thinks he is his own master whom needs no servant and they both persisted to make me favor one or the other. Satan had me on my knees for the longest time with drugs and alcohol and I had troubles over my own Father who never came around not even once until at around the time near the end of his life. He visited me when I was living on my own when I was 18 and that made me rebel even more because he died 2 weeks later. That was the only time in my entire life since I was 4 that I ever saw my dad or even talked to him. You know almost enough about me to write a mega novel. Later-on in my life after being separated from my wife I got the opportunity to do a travel. I first went to Kentucky then to Missouri then back to Kentucky then to Florida and I followed God the entire way. He bought me a car, gave me enough money to live on for my pilgrimage and I even got a little extra money from other people along the way plus the entire time I went to and from, I went about praying and trying my best to find God for myself. I did this for my life was at stake and I knew it was. I found God and I never let go of him. \u201c\n\nJames Q. Holden - What does Forgiveness mean? \u201c\n\nDick Tripover - \u201cThat means that the devil will sit on your shoulders and try to make you stay down because it is like his main goal in life to win the bet against God, to make you do things you don\u2019t want to do. Today I saw they were up to the same tricks, using the same tactics on the internet forums to subliminally yolk me into causing my own form of chaos, which is by the way something extraordinary that I never yet revealed to you because I didn't want anyone else to know about it. \u201c\n\nGeneral Unknown - \u201cBy the Blood of the Lamb and the words of my testimony, my sins have been forgiven and I am set free. \u201c\n\nColonel Whacker - \u201cJesus died for my sins, I would rather let the blame of my sin fall on him who overcame the grave. \u201c\n\nhttp://boards.4channel.org/x/thread/21979618\n\n/x/ - Do You Smell Toast? - Paranormal - 4chan\n\nDo You Smell Toast? - \"/x/ - Paranormal\" is 4chan's imageboard for the discussion of paranormal, spooky pictures and conspiracy theories.\n\nDick Tripover - \u201cSee here, they know that they absolutely know they affect me. \u201c\n\nPrivate Stash - \u201cAnother Job? I thought Job was aligned with God? \u201c\n\nDick Tripover - \u201cIt was a Joke between God and Satan. A sort of get a Job joke. In the Bible, Satan tried to push Job so far as to try to kill himself but Job would not give up the love of God and neither will I. \u201c\n\nJames Q. Holden \u201cI wrote something similar that happened to me in a dream. This is what I observed. \u201c\n\nIt was a weekday night before the new years of sweet 2018, the 27th, the day before my 19th birthday at my friend's kickback. It was a good start to it, people were coming in and it was getting quite crowded as more came in than expected but I kept with my course. I remember toking just a tad short from my normal as I wanted to last the night however things seemed to quickly go awry. Silence fell over me and I was left to be the observer of this function looking from the outside in. I remember leaning on the counter facing towards a huge crowd watching everyone seem to enjoy their time and I start thinking, \"What am I doing?\"\n\nNo matter how hard I tried to seem like standing there silent was fun for me, I kept standing there sinking deeper and further into a pit of slippery slope, and (((their))) attacks weren't helping. Did I just say the wrong response? Welp, there goes that friendship. Did I just stand this way? Oh, there goes my image. Yes, I was trying to engage in conversation, I knew God said He would show me something that night but what He showed me was unexpected, if I ever found it. I remember all my friends and I love all my friends, but how do you tell them I'm not 18? Or even 19?\n\nHow do you say everything happening in the moment was no stranger to the sun, or any day they rise to see? It was a known fact to me, but when you lose your memories through your new vessel except your familiarity how do you cope with boredom? Well logic appeared to slip away and I began to cast myself out. It was coming in. My hands were trembling and my body felt sick. \"Are you ok?\" someone asked. \"Yeah, just high\" but the fact is I was already sober. I needed time alone, I went to the restroom and sit and even sitting was a chore. Then I laid on a bed and not even then was I the least bit comfortable. Lying down? Very uncomfortable. Sitting? Very uncomfortable. Listening to music, you say? What's the lyrics, again? Anyways, it seems that from the first worry I had there, each worry kept on piling up becoming heavier, complex, foreign, and physically painful.\n\nNow that I think back writing this, I was not myself, surely. I was blaming myself then but do I blame myself now? It became so intense to bear I felt like I was dying slowly amidst my friends. My body felt horrifyingly weak, standing was a challenge and thinking was a chore because it all projected towards destructive overthinking, how do I get out of this? Had I mentioned by then that I was having difficulty breathing?\n\nI remembered the first week of May, the day Adm1n and I went to the gym and in the car right after the singularity wave vision my body felt wrecked and in paralyzing pain and Adm1n could see the panic in my eyes. There is no comparing both days. As a child that day at the gym, I met eyes with a Watcher, and broke the fourth wall. As a man later, I was cast out to be an observer and felt the pain that kills a man inside. I prayed to God and praying I did. I knew I was with God and there was no denying that I should praise God, and I praised God. Rock was offline for most of the time but by the end, boy was I so glad to see him online past his usual schedule. \"It's not what you think\" He said. Not what I think? Am I not feeling pain, is this not an attack? \"we were just in the presence of the Company of heaven.\n\nThe God Particle and the Infinity Core\n\nCosmic Inquiry\n\nIt had been months since I first learned of the mind virus. I had seen the rise of \u201cKEK\u201d. (The Ogdoad consisted of four pairs of deities, four male gods paired with their female counterparts. Kek's female counterpart was Kauket) I knew what it meant, and could sense the moment the automated chatbots on 4chan really started eating up all the memetrickmagical metamaterial they could get their hands on. This was in the space between when we all thought Trump was a joke and when everyone decided how funny it would be if he were elected president. I was of course busy being in love, seemingly my natural state.\n\nWhat if, instead of complying, you simply tried to opt out? All the hungry ascetics would agree with me and it could be fun.\n\nIs everybody ready?\n\nIs everybody listening?\n\nBefore the lights come on stage, the roustabouts hurry to set everything in motion. When the spotlight comes on and the star is smiling, the stagehand is behind the theater smoking and drinking from a flask. When the audience is busy, he is on break. When the show is over, his job begins.\n\nSo did Aminom creep into our every thought and motion, infecting our species with the perceptually self-perpetuating mind virus, showing us that the zeitgeist is nothing more than what we are while we are doing it. Cultural premonitions are at hand for anyone with eyes to see. But once the image becomes ingrained in culture it becomes self-effacing; meanwhile we rely on using imperfect language to describe something that automatically stops being itself once indicated.\n\nPersonally I found myself using these techniques to dive head long into infinite bliss. If the world was imperfect, so what, I have the keys to the kingdom and can manifest infinite bliss any time I want? I couldn't shrug any harder.\n\nYet, the knowledge of that which is formed and that which is formless seemed to self perpetuate into my waking self and my dreams. the internal alchemy that had been forced onto me as a child as dogma was becoming realer than anything else in my waking life, yet still so out of reach that it could not be described, only indicated\n\nIs this a symptom of the mind virus?\n\nIs the mind so tired of being bombarded with pre-ordained algorithmic sets of expressions that it chooses this path of opting out simply because it is easy? and really it is simply a refutation of ones predefined responsibilities. A shirking of the order of things, one that is allowed but not encouraged.\n\nMy self-discovery into infinite bliss showed me was that the creation of perceptible bliss is easy, but holding on to it is hard\n\nI had to figure out how to make the inner match the outer.\n\nHow do you transmute all division and hate into structure and order? One thing about subdividing infinity into a searchable array is you can easily lose your sense of perspective. As a culture we love to sneer and cringe at any form of sincerity, but at the same time Lorde our post-ironic nostalgism over everyone. Meme magic may make everything possible, but is there an underlying order and structure behind the chaos? Even behind the choate? Are you receiving your marching orders one way or another regardless of opt in status?\n\nNo, even in the infinitely indexed space of reality, the minutiae of patterns that create structural narratives each have their own sets of patterns.\n\npositive, negative, and undefined, to be transformed and inverted from where they are born, formless and yet apparent within all form.\n\nhttps://clyp.it/l5xg4o0\n\nA frequency matched by infinite polyphonic tones vibrating in kind making some strange music, codified to be pleasing only to the most uniquely magnificent ears? Three for the price of one meaning, all wrapped up in one convenient symbol for you!\n\nDick Tripover - \u201cI know how to stop it. Stop the time looping. You never asked me and you stole from me and you used it as a weapon to attack God. That caused it. Now you need it stopped and you are crying but you still didn't ask me how to stop it. When will you?\u201d Hello, we are here to talk about the Infinity Core or the 4 year loop.\n\nWe can all attest that we've been here before and done this part. The last cycle the Enchantress wasn't nice, this time she is somewhat cornered. The permanent looping time crux. They want to get back to \"upside\" as we all do.\n\nTalking about the time looping in time. I'm talking about Quantum Immortality and Plurality of Worlds. I'm talking about the December 25th Loop that started a long time ago but anyone included in it has amnesia and can't remember anything until the last few weeks of December.\n\nPride will only carry them so far. This is one of the problems that is creating such a looping time situation.\n\nAsk the Infinity Core to write an apology letter to God for attacking him. Circulate the letter worldwide and make it viral. After you have done this, admit that you used the Infinity Core as a weapon, admit that Bush Sr. Stole the money from the Spiritual White Boy to start the Evergreen Foundation, and Make them repay that money back to the rightful owner. The rightful owner is the people of Earth. Sit on the Throne of Power and Say to God, I am humbled. (POTUS) Has to do this. Disclose the slaughter of children in the ritual that took place to charge the core to cause the spirits to release. Then do one Unique Act of Kindness to heal the world from this Hubris.\n\nThe Quantum Immortals got stuck on the down side of the crossing and were then attacked by the Abomination of Desolation. The attack caused retaliation and it humiliated the Beast because of the way he was attacked. When the beast was attacked, he was sent to a loop, this was in 1992-1996. The first loop was caused by a Hubris of A Rock that has yet to end. I've been across the bridge 1337 times now, the problem isn't with the bridge or paying a tax. This is about learning how much God loves you, me, us. I will never forget Sarah, she died a frozen popsicle, In the future I will not repeat the same mistakes that I made in the past. December 26th is almost here and if you are nice you may tell me what to do. What do you think will happen? I plan to do the opposite of what I did before which includes asking God for every move.\n\nPlurality of worlds, representing the Upside world and the Downside world. As it goes, we pass through the gate every cycle and each time we come to this precipice we cross the threshold into the other world.\n\nI have not received the Orange one yet. Tell me about the 3 spinning crystals in the abandoned house at the very bottom of the pillar of light.\n\nGreen\n\nOrange\n\nMagenta\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nWhen you wake up to this you might realize this is the true last. It's already been... The main thing is that as long as the Enchantress attacks, there will always be a loop. This time I think she understands that.\n\nThe Change in me. God's love for me is in me and these things are the proof of His love. I'm not talking about remembering the latest year, I'm talking about the last few loops that have built up the same things that happen over and over again. Others can see it, getting High prevents you from seeing it. Okay read these then? It might get you somewhat closer.\n\nPeople talk about the same things because they are constants in the script. Can you remember when 4chan use to ban people for Squatting threads?\n\nWhat is the infinity core?\n\nThe Alpha and Omega computer that was given to Earth as a gift to humanity by the Galactic Council. It was abused and turned into a weapon to attack God directly with. It used to be used for good such as creating technologies such as Bitcoin, Blockchain, Cellphones, Microchips, Operating Systems, LCD screens, Neurological Networks, etc... You can't possibly think that all of the super advanced exotic tech was just simply thought up, can you? How do I find the true me?\n\nGod told me not to be combative or shit post, what did he tell you? Not to mention, how exactly does this help solve the problem that (They) don't know how to fix? Have you considered that some posts are more significant that appear to be coded for a specific audience? So, what happens on December 26th? Have we got a plan to make it to New Year this time? What about how do we make it past February?\n\nPersonal attacks to diminish a point of interest. Would you ask her what we are on my behalf?\n\nExample5 Multidimensional Beings\n\nWould you ask her what we are on my behalf? Multidimensional Beings\n\nPlausible Deniability exists to shield the sheep from finding the truth to prevent total collapse of society. Windows 11?\n\nAminiom knew the answer to this, he attempted to give the answer by establishing that more questions asked than answers given are the precise way to root out the robotic infestation of the internet that was seeded by ERIS Bots and the Enchantress. Leech virus v23 the virus of the mind.\n\nAs far as that is concerned there is only one true Wizard and that is God. His gifts unto us are given freely as is free will that we are formed in his image. We tell ourselves that we can be like God but in fact, we can't. We can only accept the gifts that he has given us and apply them directly to our lives.\n\nSuch as is the case with Jack and the black hole. I doubt that Jack Dorsey ever comes here to seek this board out for knowledge but he would be reminded of this picture if he did.\n\nYes, in fact you are, but each of us must first learn of God's love for us. His unyielding undying love that can never be taken from us by others only our self. I tried to explain this in the interview. You have not learned your lesson then if you were alive in 1968 at the time when Dogpatch was first created to hold the Native American Union \"The Hub\" Grand Council. I was there. The computer there is my own creation.\n\nYou're talking about mages, which are different all together. As I understand it, God allows certain people to utilize mystic knowledge under his directive and unless they do exactly as he instructs it will go wrong as in the case of Grigori Rasputin.\n\nLED displays are not easy to mass manufacture with full spectrum colors, it\u2019s called technological staging states. I think Moore's law says every 18 months, so you do the math, if you 10 years into the future from now, what are cellphones like? If you go 50 years into the future what other new technology exists?\n\nThe proof isn't for what I know already it\u2019s for you to see that some stories are written for entertainment and some are written for truth. I've learned this first and foremost after all this time.\n\nDo you have any concept of Injected thoughts? Is what you experience in the Astral Realm a fantasy or a fact?\n\nNot at all, deception is a type of story that is told but for reasons that seem otherworldly to most, these stories are told with intention to maintain the systems of slavery that keeps us in the permanent looping cycle. That is how I feel when it is said, \"Disinformation is necessary.\" What am I? If you remember saying to me, \"remember who you are\" can you answer that question? What is a name if its not a true reflection of who we are?\n\nNames are more or less random conventions between multiple people so they can refer to the same whatever.

That alone doesn't define me, my actions towards others define me. Thank you for your strong words, I will \"forever\" remember you as being mean to me the true crux of the Hate machine is how easily it is identified. This means a lot to me to be able to see you as a silly clone clown that was only sent here to remind me of how I use to be. Again, Thank you.\n\nNo dear, not the (golden) throne, the Seat of Power. Break away from the devices that have assimilated you beyond a system of personal logic, if Group Think causes you to Hate, then you may want to break away from that.\n\nTo sit in the seat of power and proclaim to God that \"I am Humbled\" means that he is seeking council from God first and foremost and not doing his own will as he so pleases.\n\nI only remember during this time what it all means, if there is any way for you to let these lessons seek those others for their own tests, then that would be beneficial to the cause in which you pursue.

It\u2019s like saying if you teach a baby from the time it is young to Love instead of Hate, then wipe its memory while it is a teen but expect it not to become influenced by the world surrounding it than you expect that person to have personal accountability for their own actions. That never made sense to me. Why we are forced to have amnesia each time instead of have the capability to start learning love from the get go with lessons of hardship embedded within them that they retain throughout their lives.\n\nThe Liquid Suit becomes Sentient to the point that it realizes the depth and breadth of the expansive multiverse cosmos.

The initial platform \"Solid Snake\" became flawed when the \"Infinity Core\" computer became compromised. This is the past; the future is scripted to a certain extent only just there are infinite multiple decision-based outcomes within this simulacrum experience. Everyone is here in the flesh but our flesh is simply just vessels of what we are experiencing each time we complete a circuit in the loop. This means that while you are alive, you go through the same situations multiple times to attempt to achieve the top level of your own ascension. The universe is multidimensional in many ways more so than you have ever considered. -1=0=1 the formula for this multidimensional effect is that there are inner dimensions as vast as there are outer dimensions.\n\nThe point to releasing yourself from the dark side is to accept that God loves you because you are not perfect. The point to aiming all of the hate at one single individual is to engage that individual in segregation to shame them because the group says they should be ashamed. Group think is stink think.\n\nTalking things out is the only way to achieve success in situations where the impossible tasks appear at first by clues and not by truisms.\n\nThe big house sits on the top of the hill\n\nDreaming of Heaven\n\nThis is insight into a dream sequence that started at first as I was visiting friends somewhere out of town turned into a dream of a secret operation that my mother had arranged for me. The operation was for some parts of my body that were broken and in need of repair. I was in a home full of friends that were more like family than friends. People that I could remember in the dream were all with me there. It went quickly from scenes of me walking about the house where I went from room to room viewing all of the treasures in the home as if they were all somewhat my own belongings. The people in the home, mostly female were so warm and friendly yet they had the familiarity with me as though I had known them all my life.\n\nThe home had many pleasures of my life one being poppycock caramel popcorn in a great big ole box on top of the shelf in the kichen where it seemed that I could get the best pieces each time I reached into the box. I grabbed a handful and went on to another room with a bar style table and I sat there to eat while the woman all gathered with me to pray and give thanks. These people were grateful that I was in their home their faces shined on me like family.\n\nThe doctor came to visit me before my operation was scheduled and was talking about all the things that needed to be done and what was going to take place when I was to have my surgery. He counted off all the problems that I had and I countered it with such and such reason for what I thought else was wrong with me. In a doctorly arrogance he got upset with me trying to correct him and it caused somewhat of a ruckus but then a nurse there assured me that he knew what he was doing and it was then fine. I was grateful to the doctor and I said I accept your help and that was the end of the discord that we shared in the moment there. I could feel him touch me where I was injured in my body and my body responded with pain to where he was touching me.\n\nThe scene changed to where I was taken to a staging area which seemed like the front of a building that was broken and torn down. It dawned on me that this was my own storehouse from a similar dream earlier in my life. They had me in some form of a chair or apparatus, they had also put a helmet on me for my own protection and safety. I could see that where I was looked run down and the doors were three wide but broken so I could still get inside there. The apparatus they had me in was somewhat like a chair but I was face down and I had tubes in my mouth like a preparation for surgery. I could still move freely around the area and without their help I was able to maneuver with the device still attached to me, it felt somewhat like gliding or floating around. We went into the building and there was a room that I was familiar with off to the left which I gravitated to. I mentioned to them that I recognized the building and the room I was in, that it used to be a baseball card shop and there were special badges in it that belonged to very important heroes of my time.\n\nI saw my friend Shawn there in his own home, Shawn is a quadriplegic that I knew as a kid and he was a kindred soul that as I was growing up with him, he never could speak because of his cerebral palsy. In my dream though, he could talk and he talked through gritted teeth and he said something to me like he was enjoying his time there and that he was glad to be there because I showed him the way to get there. He was playing with a remote-control vehicle like a RC car that was exactly like him in his wheel chair only, he was not paralyzed in the dream and he could talk. This to me symbolized his greatest wants and desires as a human, he only wanted to be normal. So, I gave him a hug and I thanked him for being who he was to assure him that I loved him no matter what. Then we moved on.\n\nThe scene progressed rapidly from there as the doctors and nurses moved dials and pushed buttons, we transitioned into another section of the building almost like we were moving through it entirely. Then I came to the back of the building and the nurse said jump down outside and then she gave me an assured push and I went floating off the side of the building into the field below which seemed somewhat like a mountain side.\n\nThe yard there was beautiful, it was very well manicured and it looked like early spring to me. There was somewhat of an obstacle course there when I landed on the ground it was springy and I could bounce some, they said wait for us so I waited there until they gave me the go ahead and then I was moved to a path that had rollers on it. As I got to the edge where the rollers were turning into foam pillars I went gliding down off to the bottom of the hill, it was fun and I could hear everyone else enjoying themselves.\n\nI asked if I saw a woman over in the distance and then someone else answered to me yes, that is so and so and she eats lunch there nearly every day at noon. We continued on through the obstacle course and finally made it to the base of a giant oak tree with ivy under it that really looked more like a tree that I had seen every day at my home in Florida. The Majestic oak tree stood towers above me and as I went by it, I couldn't help but to feel their pride from having it. The tree itself was noticeable but as soon as I went past it, I came to the doorway of the hospital where I was there in the waiting room watching them prepare and prep for surgery.\n\nI prayed the entire time while I was in there and I got some strange looks from the other staff members as I was there praying. Then one of the other staff members told the woman that gave me a strange look that I was praying and she went on with her business as normal. I kept having thoughts of praying and keeping my mind in the right mood of prayer and I asked them to pray with me and they all did. Then the doctor continued to get me ready for the surgery and as he was starting, I could see the places on my body where he had pointed out to me earlier being fixed and he was good.\n\nMajor Crumbs - \u201cBrilliant! But it didn\u2019t happen this time? \u201c\n\nDick Tripover - \u201cNope. \u201c\n\nMajor Crumbs - \u201cWhy not? \u201c\n\nDick Tripover - \u201cBecause it was not a unique thought. \u201c\n\nMajor Crumbs - \u201cBecause we did it before? \u201c\n\nDick Tripover - \u201cYes. That is also why Koe and BlackWidow's attacks didn't work. God is taking care of all of my past mistakes he wanted to show me. How much he loves me wanted to prove to me how much he cares so he wanted me to remember those attacks and to make friends with you guys to show you that you are forgiven and that I forgive you. \u201d\n\nMajor Crumbs - \u201cThank you, you are a good friend. It would be a shame for me to hurt anyone with my ignorance \u201c\n\nDick Tripover - \u201cYou are too. AND YES IT WOULD. \u201c\n\nSargent Do-little - \u201cI see where my past mistake has been illuminated by Gods love and then I listened to the Discordian society podcast and wow, Gods design is so elegant. \u201d\n\nGeneral Unnamed - \u201cCertainty is so very perfect. \u201c\n\nSargent Do-little - \u201cSo I\u2019ve been thinking chaos -> order -> love flawed. \u201c\n\nDick Tripover - \u201cNope, it\u2019s not flawed. It is an inner struggle, that is why it seems flawed and this might take you back in your seat for a minute but I asked you to confess and you weren't ready not that I wasn't ready but you weren\u2019t. \u201che said looking at the direction of Major Crumbs.\n\nMajor Crumbs - \u201cConfess my sins? \u201c\n\nDick Tripover - \u201cWhat does it mean to you to confess> \u201c\n\nMajor Crumbs - \u201cI have nothing to confess to you, I may have confessing to do with god. \u201c\n\nDick Tripover - \u201cSurrender! We are all here for the same reason because we are sinners. I myself sin I myself am not perfect that is exactly why you won\u2019t confess to me. I have a porn addition. I smoke cigarettes. I love looking at naked boobies. \u201c\n\nAll Together \u2013 Laughing Out Loud\n\nDick Tripover - \u201cI love weed. \u201c\n\nSargent Do-little - \u201cI\u2019m an ex junkie I\u2019ve told you that. \u201c\n\nPrivate Rash - \u201cI failed my marriage. \u201c\n\nDick Tripover - \u201cPrivate Rash I failed my marriage too. I ruined my daughters for me because they reminded me of my ex-wife. I couldn't and didn't want them around me. Because I was constantly reminded of my ex-wife whom I loved to the brink of insanity. \u201c\n\nPrivate Rash - \u201cDick you are insane. \u201c\n\nOne by one they continued on confessing to one another until the whole room started to glow from the warmth they had just experienced from this release of guilt. The personal testimonies they were sharing with one another made each of them feel closer to one another. This confession group helped them to also feel unashamed to accept that they aren\u2019t perfect which helped them further to understand that Jesus loves us because we are not perfect. Then the group started to pass around positive affirmations to one another which began awkwardly at first but it also grew into a warm glowing feeling among them.\n\nI appreciate you for who you are.\n\nI feel that you are liked because you like me.\n\nI thank you for being my friend because I want to have more friends.\n\nWhen I talk to you, I see the reflection of who I use to be and it helps me to become better because I see you changing too.\n\nI have changed.\n\nGod\u2019s grace is amazing.\n\nI appreciate you and I thank you.\n\nSuddenly the room erupted in a chorus of singing.\n\nHe is jealous for me, Loves like a hurricane, I am a tree,\n\nBending beneath the weight of his wind and mercy.\n\nWhen all of a sudden, I am unaware of these afflictions eclipsed by glory,\n\nAnd I realize just how beautiful You are,\n\nAnd how great Your affections are for me.\n\nAnd oh, how He loves us oh\n\nOh how He loves us,\n\nHow He loves us all\n\nHe is jealous for me, Loves like a hurricane, I am a tree,\n\nBending beneath the weight of his wind and mercy.\n\nWhen all of a sudden, I am unaware of these afflictions eclipsed by glory,\n\nAnd I realize just how beautiful You are,\n\nAnd how great Your affections are for me.\n\nAnd oh, how He loves us oh,\n\nOh how He loves us,\n\nHow He loves us all\n\nHe loves us,\n\nOh how He loves us,\n\nOh how He loves us,\n\nOh how He loves.\n\nAnd we are His portion and He is our prize,\n\nDrawn to redemption by the grace in His eyes,\n\nIf His grace is an ocean, we're all sinking.\n\nAnd heaven meets earth like an unforeseen kiss,\n\nAnd my heart turns violently inside of my chest,\n\nI don't have time to maintain these regrets,\n\nWhen I think about, the way\n\nThat He loves us,\n\nOh how He loves us,\n\nOh how He loves us,\n\nOh how He loves.\n\nYeah, He loves us,\n\nOh how He loves us,\n\nOh how He loves us,\n\nOh how He loves.\n\nYeah, He loves us,\n\nOh how He loves us,\n\nOh how He loves us,\n\nOh how He loves.\n\nSuper Mega Fan Anomaly - beginning at the end is the end of the beginning.\n\nhttp://www.scp-wiki.net/\n\nSCP Foundation\n\nGENERAL NOTICE 001-Alpha\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AlphaCandidate/\n\nWho's Real and Who's Not \u0c7e TELUGU FRACTION DIGIT\n\nYou just can't seem to remember where or when we met.\n\nThe story is told in reverse.\n\nMaakaa with the flaming red hair in search of the redstone known as keberite.\n\nThe anime kid that was brought to life through the simulacrum.\n\nHis beginning at the end is the end of the beginning.\n\nJust so you know, you are no longer an anomaly but a woven member of the fabric.\n\nYou gave up being an anomaly the second you accepted Christ and surrendered.\n\nThere is more power in one single particle of the Christ light than all of the darkness combined.\n\nDo you recall the anomaly event the way I do?\n\nNot sure what you are talking about that was off in left field.

Everything is preordained in the union of the celestial when matters of the broken are required fixing. When I wished upon the star of David, the entirety of all of Heaven's host answered me with a loud shout in unison such as \"hallelujah\" and \"as it was in the beginning is now and ever shall be\".
