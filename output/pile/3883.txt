    "text": "The Red-eared Slider (RES) is a medium-to-large sized turtle capable of reaching straight carapace lengths of 7 to 9\" in males & 10 to 12\" in females (note: in rare cases larger red-ears have been found).\nMale RES are smaller than their female counterparts, reaching ~ 7 - 9\" adult SCL. Males have elongated front claws to aid in courtship and mating rituals & their tails are much longer than females.\n\nTHINK CUTE? THINK TWICE!\n\nMany times people believe and are told by the vendors that the hatchling will not grow. WRONG! They will grow into the size of this paper very fast. Those cute turtle lagoons usually sold along the turtle are what we call \u201cDeath Bowls\u201d. The images speak for them selves.\n\nDIET\n\nThroughout their lives, RES are omnivores progressing from predominant carnivore as juveniles to predominant herbivore as adults. Be careful not to overfeed your Slider. Recommended feeding only 2 to 3 times a week for adult turtles and every day or every other day for the rapidly growing hatchlings. Sliders will consume vegetables, greens such as mustard greens, turnip greens, dandelion, spinach, carrots, zucchini and any aquatic vegetation, i.e. duckweed, water lettuce, water hyacinth, etc. They will also consume insects, worms, snails and fish. Many of the commercially prepared turtle diets that exist on the market today are excellent Slider food. You must provide Calcium for proper shell growth. Powdered calcium can be sprinkled on foods. It is suggested that one use calcium supplemented with vitamin D3 if the animal is being maintained indoors and calcium without D3 if it is outdoors. Provision of a cuttlefish bone, which can be gnawed if desired, is also recommended.\n\nRECOMMENDED ENCLOSURE\n\nTEMPERATURE RANGE (\u00b0F)\nAir Temperature: mid 70's - 80's\nBasking Temperature: High 80's to low 90's\nWater Temperature: ~ 72 to 76 degrees for sub-adults\n& adults, 78 to 80 degrees for hatchlings & smaller juveniles.\nFor single adult male RES could do okay in a 75 gallon aquarium. Single large adult females need a minimum of a 125 gallon tank. This allows them decent room (quality of life) in addition to plenty of water to assist in good health and filtration. Basking areas can be made of anything that will support their weight and is non-abrasive. Smaller enclosures tend to resemble prison cells.\nWould you like to spend your whole life in the bathroom size prison cell?\nPredator safe outdoor pond is the BEST!\n\nTuesday, October 6, 2015\n\nIn the early fall wild box\nturtles will begin to search for a protected place to spend the winter.\nIt\u2019s crucial to assess your box turtle\u2019s health before you allow it to\nhibernate. There are many questions you need to ask and answer before\nyour box turtle can safely hibernate. The first is should you even\nhibernate the turtle? If it is healthy, then yes. Hibernation helps\nturtles maintain normal thyroid activity, synchronize their reproduction cycles, and complete their normal life expectancies.\n\nHere are do\u2019s and don\u2019ts for successful hibernation:\n\n\u2022 Do take the time to prepare a proper hibernation place for your outdoor box turtle. Don\u2019t leave it up to chance.\n\n\u2022 Do choose an area that does not flood or collect run-off water. Your turtles could drown.\n\n\u2022 Don\u2019t hibernate sick, light weight or young box turtles. Keep them\nindoors in a roomy, well heated tank and feed them all winter long.\n\n\u2022\nDo protect your hibernating box turtles from foraging wild animals like\nrats, mice or raccoons and from other pets that may break open their\nhibernation boxes or dens.\n\n\u2022 Do check on your hibernating turtles\nonce in awhile. You may find ill turtles above ground or the signs of\nwild animals foraging for food.\n\nFriday, May 23, 2014\n\nMay is a busy month for turtles. Turtles wake up from hibernation\nand it's time for mating, migrating, nesting, and babies. Therefore in\n2000, May 23 was designated World Turtle Day.\n\nSpring\nand early summer is a time of turtle nesting and babies. You can see\nturtles walking on the road or turtle hatchlings around local ponds and\ncreeks. However cute they look and no matter how much your child wants\nto pick them up and take them home it\u2019s not a good idea.\n\nTurtles\u2014sea, freshwater, or terrestrial\u2014are the favorite animals of many\npeople. These attractive creatures continue to beat incredible odds to\nsurvive in today\u2019s world of increasing pet and food trade, pollution and\nshrinking habitat.

You can see\nturtles walking on the road or turtle hatchlings around local ponds and\ncreeks. However cute they look and no matter how much your child wants\nto pick them up and take them home it\u2019s not a good idea.\n\nTurtles\u2014sea,\nfreshwater, or terrestrial\u2014are the favorite animals of many people.\nThese attractive creatures continue to beat incredible odds to survive\nin today\u2019s world of increasing pet and food trade, pollution and\nshrinking habitat. Here are some suggestions on how you can help those\nbeautiful and important little creatures, which have been part of our\necosystem for a long, long time:\n\n1. Give Turtles a Brake.\nFirst, be safe and don\u2019t have an accident; then if possible avoid\nhitting the turtle. If you can safely stop and you want to do so, move the turtle off the road in the direction in which it was going.\nIf the turtle is a large one, or a snapping turtle, use a stick to\nnudge him gently across the road without getting too close. Do not pick\nup a turtle by its tail, as it can cause dislocation of the turtle\u2019s\nspine.\n\n2. Protect Turtle habitat. Support\nyour local turtle conservation programs. Report any abuse, poaching (of\nsea turtles, her eggs or hatchlings for example), or any other of your\nconcerns to a local legal agency like Texas Parks & Wildlife\ndepartment. These activities are violations of U.S. state and federal laws.\n\n3. Don\u2019t take turtles out of the wild. A\ngame warden will fine you if you get caught. Turtles take up to 10\nyears before reaching sexual maturity to reproduce. Taking a turtle out\nof the wild will cause great harm to the future population of turtles. When the population is thinned beyond a certain point, adults are unlikely to find each other for mating. Many turtle species lays relatively few eggs and the hatchlings are very vulnerable during their first years to predation. This means not enough turtles can be produced for the population to survive and the population becomes reproductively dead.\n\n4. Enjoy Turtles in the Wild.\nNever keep wild turtles as pets or buy them from a pet store. The trade\nin reptiles as pets is responsible for tremendous animal suffering and\nserious damage to turtle populations. Learn to enjoy turtles by\nobserving them in their natural habitat, where they belong. If turtles\nlive in your yard, why not keep them happy by building a pond and by\nlandscaping with plants that provide protection and food? Edible plants\nfor turtles include tropical hibiscus, dandelion, geraniums, and Chinese\nlantern. (Make sure that your plants are free of pesticide and\nherbicide residue.) Piles of leaves, vines, and downed trees make\nperfect turtle hiding places.\n\n5. Don't release turtles back in wild.\nThink twice before buy turtle as a pet. Turtles can live 40, 60 even\nhundred years. They can grow large and need lots of space to roam or/and\nswim. This is the number one reason of turtles being released back in\nwild. Turtles kept in captivity for a while often lose the need for\nhunting since they have been fed and they will not be able to survive in\nthe wild. An even bigger problem can develop, that is releasing the\nturtle, even in its potentially native habitat, will affect biodiversity\nof the pond or lake you release it in. Introduction of parasites and\nillnesses can wipe out entire fish or other local fauna population. For\nhelp, contact your local Turtle Club, Herpetological Society, Wildlife\nrehabilitator or your local animal shelter.\n\n6. Get Turtles out of U.S. Live Animal Markets. Turtles are among the most popular offerings at live animal markets in the United States.\nThey suffer terrible abuse in filthy, neglectful conditions, and are\nslaughtered by being cut apart while conscious. The vast majority of\nmarket turtles are taken from the wild, contributing to declining U.S.\nturtle populations. Tell state wildlife agencies that you\u2019re concerned\nabout the increasing collection of wild turtles to supply animal markets\nin the United States and abroad (mostly in Asia).\n\n7.Say NO to turtle racing.Turtle\nracing is an event that is often held for the entertainment of young\nchildren at fairs, picnics, rodeos and socials across the U.S.\nusually without knowing what harm they are doing to the local turtle\npopulation as well as to the individual turtles. Turtles are found and\ncollected in the wild and the overwhelming majority is picked up off of\nthe roads. These \u201ccollectors\u201d often exceed their legal limit of turtles.\nTurtles are piled up in five gallon buckets or cardboard boxes for a\ntime ranging from several days to several weeks without food or water.\nAs a result the turtles are under enormous amount of stress and\nsometimes covered with urine and feces which could spread disease among\nthe turtles.\n\n8. Don\u2019t Mess with Texas.\nPollution makes its way into bodies of water and wild areas, poisoning\nturtles and destroying their habitats. Always properly dispose of any\nhazardous materials such as paint or oil. Garbage, such as plastic bags,\nkills many pond turtles and sea turtles that either ingest it or become\nentangled in it. Reduce the amount of garbage you produce, recycle, and\ndispose of it properly.\n\n9. Spread the Word.\nEducate others about the importance of protecting turtles from\ncommercial exploitation and abuse in your community and throughout the\nworld. Be a voice for turtles.\n\n10. Join and/or support turtle conservation and educational organizations. You can find and join local Turtle & Tortoise Club/society like DFW Turtle & Tortoise club www.dfwttc.org so you can connect with others with great knowledge about chelonians and help with local efforts to\nprotect turtles. Many other organizations like TSA - Turtle Survival\nAlliance and World Chelonian Trust www.chelonia.org have a great\nresources and extensive information about captive care and\nconservational issues.\n\nFollow us on Facebook\n\nContact\n\nurbanveggie@yahoo.com or join our club on yahoo (link below)(Please check you spam box for answers just in case, thanks)Thanks for your patience :-)When you email us please include your LOCATION and PICTURES of your turtles.
