Is it okay to use #define to define a negative number, as in:\n#define kGravity -9.8\n\nXCode is changing the 9.8 to the color of my numbers I have set (purple), but the - is being shown as the same color as the define statement (orange).\nIs this legal? Will it compile?\n\nA:\n\nDid you try it? It should work fine.\nHowever, I would encourage you to not use pre-processor macros, but instead use real constants.\nstatic const float kGravity = -9.8f;\n\nPreprocessor directives are a bit frowned upon, in general. Here's some more info on the subject: #define vs const in Objective-C\n\nA:\n\nIt is absolutely legal to define negative constants with #define. What you discovered is most likely a bug in Xcode's code coloring, which will probably be fixed in one of the future revisions.\n\n"
