Pryor raises two arguments on appeal. First, he says he should benefit\n\nfrom Section 403 of the First Step Act of 2018, which changed the sentencing\n\nscheme for a defendant\u2019s second \u00a7 924(c) conviction. Second, he requests remand\n\nto the district court for reconsideration of his career offender status in light of\n\nAmendment 798 to the Sentencing Guidelines. After careful review, we affirm\n\nPryor\u2019s convictions and sentence and deny his request for remand to the district\n\ncourt.\n\n                                           I.\n\n         Pryor pled guilty to all charges against him in October 2015. Before\n\nsentencing, Pryor\u2019s presentence investigation report (\u201cPSR\u201d) determined he was a\n\n\u201ccareer offender\u201d under the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines. The PSR based Pryor\u2019s\n\ncareer offender status on three prior \u201cviolent\u201d felony convictions: two Florida\n\nconvictions for burglary of a dwelling and one Florida conviction for resisting an\n\nofficer with violence.\n\n         The PSR also found Pryor was subject to two mandatory consecutive\n\nsentences for his two \u00a7 924(c) convictions under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) and (C).\n\n\n\n                                            2\n\f               Case: 16-10806    Date Filed: 08/05/2020   Page: 3 of 9\n\n\n\nThe first \u00a7 924(c) conviction prescribed a mandatory consecutive sentence of at\n\nleast 10 years under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(iii), and the second \u00a7 924(c) conviction\n\nmandated a 25-year consecutive sentence under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(C)(i).\n\n      Pryor objected to his career offender designation. He argued that Johnson v.\n\nUnited States, 576 U.S. ___, 135 S. Ct. 2551 (2015), which invalidated the residual\n\nclause of the Armed Career Criminal Act, also applied to the similar residual\n\nclause in the Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 career offender provision at U.S.S.G.\n\n\u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2). Pryor argued his previous burglary convictions no longer qualified\n\nas crimes of violence under \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2), and thus he could not be adjudicated a\n\ncareer offender. However, Pryor acknowledged that his claim was foreclosed by\n\nUnited States v. Matchett, 802 F.3d 1185 (11th Cir. 2015), which held that Johnson\n\ndid not invalidate the career offender guideline\u2019s residual clause. See id. at 1195\u2013\n\n96. Citing Matchett, the district court overruled Pryor\u2019s objection to career\n\noffender status.\n\n      Pryor was sentenced in January 2016. He received 180-month terms on both\n\nthe carjacking and assault charges and a 120-month term for the felon-in-\n\npossession charge, all running concurrently. He also received a mandatory\n\nconsecutive term of 120-months for the first \u00a7 924(c) charge of carrying a firearm\n\nduring a crime of violence, and another mandatory consecutive term of 300-\n\nmonths for the second \u00a7 924(c) charge. Pryor\u2019s total sentence was 600-months\n\n\n\n                                          3\n\f              Case: 16-10806     Date Filed: 08/05/2020   Page: 4 of 9\n\n\n\nincarceration. The government timely appealed this judgment, and Pryor cross-\n\nappealed. The government dismissed its cross-appeal in December 2018.\n\n      While Pryor\u2019s appeal was pending, Congress passed the First Step Act of\n\n2018, Pub. L. 115-391. As relevant here, the Act revised the \u00a7 924(c) sentencing\n\nscheme. It changed the language of \u00a7 924(c)(1)(C) to impose a consecutive\n\nmandatory 25-year sentence for a second \u00a7 924(c) conviction only if a prior\n\n\u00a7 924(c) conviction was already finalized. Pub. L. 115-391, \u00a7 403. In simple\n\nterms, the Act did away with the 25-year consecutive sentence requirement for\n\ndefendants charged with a first and second \u00a7 924(c) violation in the same\n\nprosecution. See id.\n\n                                         II.\n\n      We review de novo the interpretation of a criminal statute. United States v.\n\nHernandez, 906 F.3d 1367, 1370 (11th Cir. 2018). Likewise, we review de novo\n\nthe district court\u2019s determination of career offender status under the Sentencing\n\nGuidelines. United States v. Whitson, 597 F.3d 1218, 1220 (11th Cir. 2010) (per\n\ncuriam).\n\n                                        III.\n\n                                         A.\n\n      Pryor argues he should benefit from the First Step Act and be resentenced\n\nwithout a 25-year mandatory minimum sentence for his second \u00a7 924(c) violation.\n\n\n\n                                          4\n\f               Case: 16-10806     Date Filed: 08/05/2020   Page: 5 of 9\n\n\n\nThe government responds that the First Step Act does not apply to Pryor because\n\nhe was sentenced by the district court almost three years before the Act was passed\n\nand the Act is not retroactive.\n\n      At the time Pryor was sentenced in January 2016, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(C)\n\nprovided for a 25-year mandatory minimum consecutive sentence if a defendant\n\nhad \u201ca second or subsequent conviction under [\u00a7 924(c)].\u201d \u00a7 924(c)(1)(C) (2012).\n\nThis subsection imposed the mandatory minimum on a defendant who was\n\nconvicted of two \u00a7 924(c) violations in a single prosecution, as Pryor was. See\n\nDeal v. United States, 508 U.S. 129, 132, 113 S. Ct. 1993, 1996 (1993).\n\n      In December 2018, Congress enacted the First Step Act, Pub. L. No. 115-\n\n391. Section 403 of the Act is titled \u201cClarification of Section 924(c) of Title 18,\n\nUnited States Code.\u201d Section 403 amended 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(C) to impose\n\nthe 25-year minimum sentence only if \u201ca violation of this subsection [\u00a7 924(c)]\n\noccurs after a prior conviction under this subsection has become final.\u201d See\n\n\u00a7 403(a) (emphasis added); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(C). Under this new language,\n\nPryor\u2019s two simultaneous \u00a7 924(c) convictions would not warrant a 25-year\n\nmandatory minimum consecutive sentence.\n\n      Section 403(b) of the First Step Act explains that the Act applies to \u201cPending\n\nCases\u201d for \u201cany offense that was committed before the date of the Act, if a\n\nsentence for the offense has not been imposed as of such date of enactment.\u201d Pub.\n\n\n\n                                          5\n\f               Case: 16-10806     Date Filed: 08/05/2020   Page: 6 of 9\n\n\n\nL. No. 115-391, \u00a7 403(b). Pryor\u2019s crime was committed before the Act was passed\n\nin 2018. Pryor acknowledges that he was sentenced nearly three years before the\n\nAct was passed. Nevertheless, he says the First Step Act applies to his sentence.\n\nHe primarily reasons that his sentence has not been \u201cfinally imposed\u201d within the\n\nmeaning of Section 403(b), because his direct appeal is still pending and his\n\nsentence has not yet been affirmed. Br. of Appellant at 9\u201310. The government\n\nsays the First Step Act does not apply to Pryor. The government maintains that a\n\nsentence is \u201cimposed\u201d by the district court when it pronounces the defendant\u2019s\n\nterm of imprisonment and enters his judgment of conviction.\n\n      Our Court recently resolved this issue in United States v. Smith, ___ F.3d.\n\n___, 2020 WL 4355560 (11th Cir. July 30, 2020). We held that \u201ca sentence is\n\n\u2018imposed\u2019 for purposes of \u00a7 403(b) [of the First Step Act] when it is pronounced in\n\nthe district court.\u201d Id. at *12. Because Pryor\u2019s sentence was imposed by the\n\ndistrict court before the passage of the First Step Act, he cannot receive First Step\n\nAct relief. Therefore, we affirm his enhanced sentence under 18 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 924(c)(1)(C).\n\n                                          B.\n\n      Pryor also seeks a remand of his case for reconsideration of his career\n\noffender status in light of Amendment 798 to the Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 career\n\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\f               Case: 16-10806      Date Filed: 08/05/2020   Page: 7 of 9\n\n\n\noffender provisions. See U.S.S.G. App. C, amend. 798 (Aug. 1, 2016). We\n\nconclude that Pryor is not eligible for this relief.\n\n      Amendment 798 changed the career offender provisions of the Sentencing\n\nGuidelines by removing burglary of a dwelling from Guidelines \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2)\u2019s\n\nenumerated offenses and eliminating \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2)\u2019s residual clause defining a\n\n\u201ccrime of violence.\u201d See U.S.S.G. App. C, amend. 798. By eliminating the\n\nresidual clause of \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2), Amendment 798 responded to the Supreme\n\nCourt\u2019s ruling in Johnson, which held unconstitutional the Armed Career Criminal\n\nAct\u2019s identically worded residual clause. See U.S.S.G. App. C, amend. 798 (citing\n\nJohnson, 135 S. Ct. at 2563).\n\n      Under Amendment 798, Pryor would no longer be considered a career\n\noffender. His career offender status was based on at least two Florida burglary\n\nconvictions and one Florida conviction for resisting an officer with violence.\n\nWithout the burglary convictions as enumerated offenses and without the residual\n\nclause, Pryor would have only one felony conviction to support his career offender\n\nstatus. See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(a) (requiring \u201cat least two prior felony convictions\u201d\n\nfor career offender status).\n\n      However, Pryor cannot benefit from Amendment 798. This Court has held\n\nthat Amendment 798 does not apply retroactively to defendants sentenced before it\n\ntook effect. See United States v. Martin, 864 F.3d 1281, 1283 (11th Cir. 2017)\n\n\n\n                                            7\n\f               Case: 16-10806     Date Filed: 08/05/2020    Page: 8 of 9\n\n\n\n(per curiam). We are bound by this precedent unless it is overruled by this Court\n\nsitting en banc or by the Supreme Court. Smith v. GTE Corp., 236 F.3d 1292,\n\n1300 n.8 (11th Cir. 2001). Pryor was sentenced in January 2016, and the\n\nAmendment went into effect on August 1, 2016. As a result, Amendment 798 does\n\nnot change Pryor\u2019s career offender status.\n\n      Pryor asks us to follow the First Circuit\u2019s decision in United States v. Godin,\n\n522 F.3d 133 (1st Cir. 2008) (per curiam). Godin remanded a case for\n\nresentencing so the district court could consider the persuasive effect of a non-\n\nretroactive, newly enacted amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines. Id. at 134\u2013\n\n36. The district court in Godin did not consider this amendment at sentencing,\n\nbecause the amendment had not yet been proposed. See id. at 134.\n\n      Pryor\u2019s case stands in contrast to Godin. The district court in Pryor\u2019s case\n\nconsidered the proposed Amendment 798 and its persuasive effect on Pryor\u2019s\n\ncareer offender status. At sentencing, Pryor\u2019s attorney told the court, \u201c[T]he\n\nSentencing Commission just eliminated the residual clause from Career Offender,\n\nand that\u2019s going to go into effect on August 1st.\u201d Counsel explicitly asked the\n\ndistrict court for \u201ca variance . . . because [applying career offender status] conflicts\n\nwith the Sentencing Commission.\u201d The government conceded that \u201c[t]here is a\n\nbasis for the Court to consider a variance because of the actions of the Sentencing\n\nCommission.\u201d After considering these arguments, the district court sentenced\n\n\n\n                                           8\n\f               Case: 16-10806    Date Filed: 08/05/2020    Page: 9 of 9\n\n\n\nPryor as a career offender under the residual clause of Guidelines \u00a7 4B1.1. The\n\ndistrict court relied on this Court\u2019s decision in Matchett, which held the residual\n\nclause in the career offender guideline was not unconstitutionally vague. See 802\n\nF.3d at 1196; see also Beckles v. United States, 580 U.S. ___, 137 S. Ct. 886, 897\n\n(2017) (affirming Matchett\u2019s holding).\n\n      The sentencing court already considered Pryor\u2019s Amendment 798 arguments\n\nand chose to sentence him as a career offender. Godin does not therefore support\n\nremand in his case. Cf. United States v. Alexander, 553 F.3d 591, 593 (7th Cir.\n\n2009) (denying remand under Godin because the defendant had the chance to\n\nargue for a reduced sentence using a proposed guideline amendment, but he \u201cfailed\n\nto draw the sentencing judge\u2019s attention to the proposal\u201d). We must affirm Pryor\u2019s\n\ndesignation as a career offender and therefore decline to remand his case.\n\n      AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                          9\n\f"
