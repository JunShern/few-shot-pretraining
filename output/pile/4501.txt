    "text": "SCORCHED EARTH\n\nJason and the Scorchers\nby Alan Crandall (July 1998)\n\nIf you happened to turn on Late Night With Conan O'Brien a few months ago, you might have\nseen something very strange.\n\nHis musical guests: a long-haired, red-neck-trucker type swayed back and forth while hammering\naway at the biggest bass guitar seen since John Entwistle's heyday; a little troll of a man made funny\nfaces while whomping away on his drum kit; the guitar player, who seemed to have wandered in\nfrom some local heavy-metal bar, was blasting out power chords and fast licks like some kind of\nroots-rock Eddie Van Halen, while periodically spinning himself around, the guitar held\nperpendicular to his chest by centrifugal force; meanwhile, a skinny, gawky spaz in an outrageous\ncowboy suit and hat whirled around the stage, performed awkward/graceful \"dance\" steps, flailed\nhis arms like a madman, fanned the guitar player with his jacket, blew a harmonica solo and, while\ndoing all of the above, howled out a song that could only be descirbed as \"country,\" even if the\nband could only be called rock`n'roll.\n\nEven O'Brien seemed a little stunned. Who the fuck were these insane people? Ladies and gents,\nJason and the Scorchers.\n\nIn the 1960's, Gram Parson made the fateful re-discovery that country music was at the roots of\nrock`n'roll, as surely as blues or r&b. Actually he wasn't the only one The Beatles had covered\nBuck Owens, The Stones did Hank Snow (and later, via association with Parsons, would pen their\nown rocking country songs). John Fogerty remembered, too - thus \"a dinosaur Victoria/listening to\nBuck Owens\" in \"Lookin' Out My Back Door,\" and later the whole Blue Ridge Rangers album, a\nclassic. Parsons also reminded The Byrds of their country roots, thus sparking the Sweetheart of\nthe Rodeo album. But by and large, and largely due to the growing rigidity of popular radio, which\nrelegated country, rock, black music, and everything else, to their own little air slots (and if you\nwant to know what killed good music after the '60's, there's one of the main culprits right there),\ncountry music and rock`n'roll, by the late '60's, were becoming two separate entities.\n\nAnother reason for this is guilt by association - by the late '60's, rock music had become the sound\nof the counterculture; it symbolized everything it's audience believed in: an end to the war in\nVietnam, free love, smoking dope, and all things countercultural. Country music had come to\nsymbolize everything establishment - a listen to Merle Haggard's infamous \"Okie From Muskogee\"\nor \"The Fightin' Side Of Me\" is instructive. The fact that Haggard meant \"Okie\" as something from\na joke had no bearing on the fact that most listeners took him at face value, and loved, or hated\nhim, for it.\n\nToday, it's even more true. Leaving aside record freaks and music-lovers like myself, the rock\naudience is unremittingly hostile to country music - I once had an avowed Eagles and Grateful Dead\nfan practically foaming at the mouth for mentioning that both of the aforementioned are heavily\ninfluenced by country music a fact only the clueless or ignorant could possibly fail to perceive.\nTry pointing out to a Stones fan that \"Honky Tonk Woman\" is, in fact, a country song go ahead,\ntry it!\n\nBy the '80's, this kind of thinking was pretty firmly entrenched. Meanwhile, country music was\nundergoing a re-shaping, thanks to Urban Cowboy and other absurdities. The music, at least it's\nmost visible end, was continuing it's trend away from traditional sounds to a more pop-rock\norientation. What passed for country on the Billboard charts was mostly closer to The Eagles or\neven Billy Joel; \"lite\" rock with a little bit of \"twang\" for flavoring. The old-timers, and those who\nstuck to their guns, started to get the cold shoulder; by 1983, Johnny Cash found himself\nunceremoniously dumped from Columbia, his label of the past thirty years.\n\nSuch was the state when a young band began to tear up Nashville's tiny punk/underground scene.\nJason Ringenberg, hog-farmer from Illinois, had his eclectic taste - a love for classic country\nmusic in all it's forms, combined with a passion for rockabilly, classic 60's rock`n'roll, and the sheer\npower and drive of punk rock, found some like-minded mental cases - with Warner Hodges on guitar,\nPerry Baggs on drums, and Jeff Johnson on bass, he put it all together into something that was\ngenuinely new; a band that played pure country music, except they played it like The Ramones.\n\nThe term \"country-rock\" conjures up a mellow, pleasant, front-porch kind of sound The\nGrateful Dead, The Eagles, Linda Rondstadt this is not how Jason and the Scorchers sounded.\n\nWarner Hodges had grown up with country music (his parents were professional musicians, and\nhad even provided back-up for several big names, including Johnny Cash); but in his teens, he got\nturned on by Jimi Hendrix, and AC/DC. So, while quite capable of picking out pure Luther Perkins\nlicks (which he did, when he wanted to), he cranked his guitar up all the way and let rip, cramming\nthe songs with power chords and pure white-noise/blues guitar licks ala Angus Young. There was\nnothing fancy about the rhythm section: Baggs and Johnson just whomped the sucker as hard as\nthey could. As for Jason, he whooped, hollered, yelped and howled, using all the tricks he'd\nlearned off of rockabilly records to make the most of his limited but powerful voice, all delivered in\nan unmistakable southern drawl`n'twang. They sounded like one of Dave Dudley's big-rigs\nbarrelling down the highway at 200 mph. There was nothing genteel or reverent about them this\nwas hard, fast, LOUD music. The music, and their wild stage show, were designed to whip an\naudience into a frenzy. They did.\n\nAnd, it was real country music. Not the watered-down adult contemporary of then (and\nstill)-current Nashville. Jason had an innate understanding of the tradition of country music\nsongwriting: cheating, drinking, love lost and found, commitment, sin and salvation, old-fashioned\nvalues, a sense of history and sometimes, a sense of the macabre. Lines like \"I tried to fight through\nthat emptiness/I feel every time you undress\" (\"Broken Whiskey Glass\") come straight from George\nJones territory. \"Shot Down Again\" started off as almost a parody: Jason's girl just can't stop\ncheating on him, and worse than that, he can't get any; \"when I tried to kiss her/Jerry Falwell shot\ntear gas in my eyes,\" but then takes a sudden dark turn into the Rubber Room (\"Well I went to love\nmy little girl/She had a golden wedding band/I walked these midnight streets alone/Bloodstains on\nmy hands \"). \"If You've Got The Love (I've Got the Time)\" was trash-county so accurate, most\nthought it was a cover. Of course, they did play covers; country chestnuts by Hank Williams, Faron\nYoung, and Jimmie Rodgers, rockabilly from Carl Perkins, rock`n'roll from The Rolling Stones.\n\nIn the '90's, there's a host of bands who play a hard rock/country hybrid, in 1981, there was no\none. Jason and the Scorchers were something genuinely new and different (although the country\nsound would take hold on the West Coast around the same time, thanks to The Blasters, X, Rank\nand File, and later, The Beat Farmers and Long Ryders). In Nashville, The Scorchers were quickly\npopular, and controversial. Nashville didn't take kindly to having their chestnuts smashed by this\nbunch of lunatics, but, based on a plethora of Nashville news broadcasts that circulate on video, the\ngeneral reaction seems to have been one of bemusement.\n\nThey gained momentum fast. A week after their first gig (January 1982), they laid down Reckless\nCountry Soul in a three-hour session. The disc (long-impossible to find, but now reissued with\nouttakes by Mammoth) captured their sound brilliantly. Within a year, they had a major-label deal\nwith EMI. They shared stages with R.E.M. (with Michael Stipe appearing on their next EP), The Replacements, and legends like Carl Perkins. The\nFervor EP followed in `84. If anything, they were even more overpowering, leaving behind the\nspare, rootsy sound of Reckless Country Soul in favor of a full-throttle roar. \"Help! There's A\nFire\" from Reckless was here transformed from a country blues to a rockabilly romp with Buddy\nHolly-esque vocals from Jason. \"I Can't Help Myself,\" their latest country massacre, went from a\nfrantic buildup to a full firestorm, while \"Pray For Me Mama (I'm A Gypsy Now)\" (another remake\nfrom Reckless), and \"Harvest Moon\" offered further proof of Jason's gift for country songwriting.\nBest of all was \"Both Sides of the Line,\" a Yardbirds-like rave-up filled with ominous apocalyptic\nimagery (\"But if the mountains fall down and the seas around/Could crumble in my midst/I'd trade it\nall for a midnight call/And just one holy kiss\"). A roaring cover of Dylan's \"Absolutely Sweet\nMarie\" became a critic's fave.\n\nSoon they were assured Next Big Thing status, and EMI started giving them The Push. Lost and\nFound, their first full-length LP, wasn't quite the breakthrough for them it seemed a little low on\nfirst-rate new material. Still the onstage fave \"White Lies,\" the great hillbilly stomp called \"Blanket\nOf Sorrow,\" terrific covers of \"Lost Highway\" and \"I Really Don't Want To Know\" (done as a\nmean blues-rocker), a definitive \"Broken Whiskey Glass\" (another remake from Reckless) and the\nlovely \"Far Behind\" were nothing to be ashamed of.\n\nI saw them that summer at the packed Keystone in Palo Alto, CA. Onstage, they were incendiary.\nI have never seen a band so determined to put an audience on their knees. Loud, frantic, thrashing\nabout the stage like crazy men. Jason, who looked like Hector Heathcoat in a suit that would\nembarrassed Nudie, leaned into a young woman's face, close enough to have kissed her instead\nhe let out with a mighty cowboy yell, then flung himself off the stage, into the audience, and\nsomehow ended up running across tables (those that weren't already occupied by dancing fans)\nwhile blasting away on his harp. In good cowboy style, he never once lost his hat, either. To this\nday, it remains one of the three or four most exciting live rock`n'roll shows I've ever seen.\n\nIf I may digress for a moment: If there's one thing the rock audience, and rock performers, have\nforgotten, it's how to be crazy onstage. I remember a friend grimacing at the sight of Joe \"King\"\nCarrasco on Saturday Night Live, prancing around in his underwear with a crown on his head\n(\"That guy's an idiot!\"). We all know Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd would never stoop to such\nsilliness.\n\nIn the beginning, rock`n'roll musicians were all crazy. Elvis shook and gyrated and generally\nshocked (and excited) middle America. Little Richard pounded his piano, played with his feet,\nhowled like a madman and got away with being as fruity as you possibly could in the mid-50's;\nChuck Berry duck-walked and shook all over a stage, while Screamin' Jay Hawkins popped out of\na coffin; and Jerry Lee Lewis well he did all of these and more. In the 60's, there were still\nsome who remembered: James Brown, Mick Jagger, The Who, Hendrix, Iggy. But more and\nmore, we got the Eric Clapton syndrome - the rock musician as Serious Artist - back to the\naudience, in commune with his instrument, pulling genius out of some deep inner part of himself. It's\nremained a model ever since. End of digression.\n\nFor the next couple years, they toured hard and played the game while EMI publicity beat the\nbushes. However, EMI wasn't getting the hit they wanted. Still Standing, their `86 followup,\nsolidified their strengths they were, if anything, better than ever. Great songs like the \"Tumblin'\nDice\" knockoff \"Golden Ball and Chain\" (The Stones are also done tribute here by a cover of \"19th\nNervous Breakdown\"), the furious blues rock of \"Shotgun Blues,\" and the country boogie \"My\nHeart Still Stands With You\" were the highlights. It was on that tour that I saw them for the second\n(and so far, last) time. It was at a place called One Step Beyond, a cavernous club that actually\nbooked a surprisingly hip lineup of acts in the mid-'80's. That time, they played to perhaps 20\npeople, perhaps 12. I remember standing right up in front, turning around and noticing that the\ncrowd of us gathered around the stage constituted everyone in the club. The show was less frantic\nthan the first time, but they still came out full-throttle, taking requests (\"Polk Salad Annie\" - Tony\nJoe White's swamp-rock hit, also one of their B-sides) and surprises: Bobby Womack's \"It's All\nOver Now,\" a final, gentle \"Amazing Grace,\" and best of all, a murderous assault on \"Country\nRoads Take Me Home,\" taken at 11 on the volume and 90 mph - hilarious, and rockin'!\n\nAs the above may indicate, Still Standing didn't sell. EMI dumped them, and for a time they\nseemed to vanish from the face of the earth.\n\nThey broke the silence in 1989, when Thunder and Fire suddenly appeared. Y'know what it's like\nwhen you buy an album you can't wait to hear, get it home and feel disappointed, try and try to like\nand then realize it's just not that hot? It started off good even though \"When The Angels Cry\" is\nclearly aimed straight at AOR, pure MTV arena-rock, it's so impassioned that they get away with\nit. Despite some highlights (a typically Scorcherized cover of Phil Ochs' \"My Kingdom For A Car,\"\n\"Bible And A Gun\" co-written with Steve Earle, and Perry's blues-rock workout \"Six Feet\nUnderground\"), most of Thunder sounded generic and rather ordinary. Plain and simple, Jason and\ncompany hadn't come up with enough interesting songs. In the meantime, the band had switched\nlabels (to A&M), lost Jeff Johnson and added a second guitar player.\n\nAnd that was it. Except for a showcase gig in Los Angeles, there doesn't seem to have been much\nof a tour. The band broke up, blaming lack of success and personal problems (read: drugs, booze,\nnot getting along).\n\nNow if you'll excuse a little personal digression. As the years passed, I sort of filed Jason and the\nScorchers away. Occasionally I'd dig the albums out and groove on them again, and regret that\nthey hadn't stuck it out. Jason (now having dropped his last name) put out a solo album in 1992,\nOne Foot in the Honky Tonk. It flopped too. Not surprisingly, because it was very much a\nschizophrenic thing, mixing Scorchers-esque rockers that would have come across a lot stronger\nwith a band that really knew how to play them (\"Hard Luck Boy\"), a handful of hard country gems\n(\"One Foot in the Honky Tonk,\" \"I Washed My Hands in Muddy Water\") and a batch of pleasant\npop-country numbers that were brilliant compared to Garth Brooks or Alan Jackson, but pretty\nthin compared to the glories of his past.\n\nOne night in 1995, I was driving a friend back from an evening's drinking, and had a Scorchers\ntape in the car. So I put it on. He'd never heard of them, but liked them immediately. Then, just a\nweek or two later, he shows up with a copy of Rolling Stone: \"Hey, check it out: Jason and the\nScorchers have a new album!\" And there it was. Not a compilation, not a posthumous live\nalbum . an actual brand-new Jason and the Scorchers album!\n\nJeff Johnson had apparently cajoled the band members back together for an anniversary show in\nNashville. During rehearsals and the fated gig, they'd realized they had something, and decided to\ngive it another whirl.\n\nA Blazing Grace was a better album than one could have hoped for. Not perfect their cover of\nGeorge Jones' \"Why Baby Why\" rips, but there's a stiffness there that wasn't around in the early\ndays. But \"Cry By Night Operator,\" \"200 Proof Lovin'\" and, finally preserved for all time, \"Country\nRoads Take Me Home\" are prime Scorchers. The other tracks were all good if not brilliant.\n\nStill, The Scorchers kept a low profile, touring only in their good towns; the South, Midwest, and\nEurope (American roots music seems to always do well in Europe). Their next opus, Clear\nImpetuous Morning, appeared without much fanfare a couple years later. It starts off great with\n\"Self-Sabotage,\" a major Scorchers classic, then gets weird with \"Cappuccino Rosie,\" picks up for\na great take on Gram Parsons' \"Drugstore Truck Drivin' Man\" (about time, guys), moves into\ncountry territory with \"Going Nowhere\" (good, not great), and then falls apart in a mishmash of \"the\nanonymous hard-rock/heavy-metal guitar sound that defined AOR radio in the '80s\" (thanks,\nAll-Music Guide) which is not only uninteresting, but dated in the worst possible way.\nApparently, Jason and the Scorchers' idea of a mainstream rock song is about ten years out of date,\nor more. They finally save face with \"Jeremy's Glory,\" a Civil War epic, but it's a little late. In\ninterviews at the time, Jason went on about how they busted their nuts to make the best album they\ncould, but overall it's their least interesting release.\n\nWhich brings us to Midnight Roads and Stages Seen, a live album celebrating their history, and a\nclear bid for Bigger Time. Live albums are rarely among an artist's finest work (to be sure, there are\nexceptions). They're basically gifts to the fans (and as such, highly appreciated), a way to mark\ntime, and sometimes a way to close off a phase of one's career. One reason you don't hear many\nraves from critics about live albums is, quite frankly, they're not very interesting to write or talk\nabout. Live remakes of old songs; generally a pretty safe selection, usually a surprise or two thrown\nin for good measure and to help attract sales.\n\nThis one pretty much plays the game, too. The \"hits\" and crowd-pleasers are here, there's a new\nsong (\"This Town Isn't Keeping You Down,\" good but not great), and a surprise Warner\nHodges' parents join them for a rockin' \"Walkin' the Dog\" (Warner's mom coulda been a\ncontender she's got a great rockabilly-type voice -- and in fact has an album of her own in the\nhopper). Jason and the Scorchers are a great live band, but they need to be seen for full\nappreciation. That being said, there are moments here that easily live up to their rep:\n\"Self-Sabotage\" starts things off with a bang; \"Absolutely Sweet Marie\" improves on the\npoor-sounding live B-side version from `85; \"Golden Ball and Chain\" and \"Both Sides of the Line\"\nget estimable workouts, and \"Harvest Moon\" is an absolute motherfucker; the band swings into the\nlast verse as hard as they can. It's the kind of thing that's hard to put into words you know it\nwhen you hear it.\n\nMidnight Roads has led to their most aggressive attempt at winning over the public since Lost and\nFound. They're touring extensively (though still not on the West Coast, where they haven't played\nin close to ten years) and played their first New York gig in many years this past April. They've\nmade a major television appearance and are scheduled, as of this writing, to appear on The\nNashville Network in July. They seem to be grabbing for the brass ring again.\n\nThe question that seems to come up again and again, with Jason and the Scorchers and countless\nothers (The Replacements, Richard Thompson) is why haven't they made it? If they're so damn\ngood, how come they're not selling 50 million albums?\n\nIt's a stupid question, really. Especially in an e-zine that's focused on\nunderground/obscure/cult/otherwise left-of-center music and musicians; especially when it's\npossible for artists with such limited commercial potential as Tom Waits or Frank Zappa to build up\nlarge and hungry cult followings without ever having a Top 40 hit or going into heavy rotation on\nMTV - hell, even the no-hit Paul Westerberg rapidly sells out every time he performs in my town;\nand Elvis Costello (also missing any Top 40 winners) fills stadiums; especially when any time one of\nthese beloved cult artists does manage to break into the mainstream, they're immediately rejected\nby a big chunk of their following for \"selling out\" (and witness the fate of poor Soul Asylum, who\nlost their hip underground constituency by landing \"Runaway Train\" on the Hit Parade, then threw\noff their new fans with a pair of half-hearted, desultory followup albums, leaving them now banished\nto limbo wherever bands go when they're neither hip, respected, or popular).\n\nBut leaving aside all the facets of that discussion, in Jason and the Scorcher's case, it does matter.\nBecause \"making it\" has been their intent from Day One. And while countless followers --- The\nSupersuckers, Wilco, Uncle Tupelo, The Bottle Rockets, and, rarely mentioned but still true, Social\nDistortion (contemporaries of The Scorchers, but don't tell me their rocked-up covers of \"Ring Of\nFire\" and \"Makin' Believe\" aren't pages from The Scorchers' songbook) have managed to carve a\nnice niche for themselves, Jason and the Scorchers seem relegated forever to \"oh yeah, them\"\nstatus. Jason and the Scorchers always meant to be the Next Big Thing.\n\nCould be a lot of reasons, I suppose. In one sense, they're probably their own worst enemies: the\nuninspired riff-rockers that fill up most of Clear Impetuous Morning aren't likely to sway many\nalt.country fans. Their demented stage show gets them laughed at in this day of \"serious\" musicians\n(Ha! See more on this above). One look at Jason's nutty cowpoke duds on The Essential Jason\nand the Scorchers caused one of my alt.country-loving pals to write them off forever.\n\nStill, I hope it works for them, mainly for purely selfish reasons. I love `em despite their recent\nfailings, they're still one of my favorite bands, and I want them to go on being Jason and the\nScorchers, and making music, and hopefully, one day, fulfilling the potential of their early releases. I\ncan't imagine them ever actually cracking the Top 40, but then again stranger things have happened.\nIf not, I hope they're determined enough to keep going. Keep rolling on, Scorchers and\ndammit isn't it time you played the Bay Area again?\n\nDISCOGRAPHY\n\nReckless Country Soul (Praxis, 1982) has been reissued on Mammoth and is essential. Fervor\nand Lost and Found have been reissued by EMI as The Essential Jason and the Scorchers,\nVol. 1 and also as Both Sides Of the Line, though I've heard both of these are now out of print.\nStill Standing was intended for The Essential Jason and the Scorchers Vol. 2, which never\nappeared. Otherwise, it's out of print. So, to the best of my knowledge, is Thunder and Fire.\n\nA Blazing Grace, Clear Impetuous Morning and Midnight Roads and Stages Seen are all\navailable from Mammoth. So is a live video for Midnight Roads that includes material not found on\nthe album.\n\nThere are a large number of rarities, including great versions of Neil Young's \"Are You Ready For\nthe Country, \" \"Honky Tonk Blues, \" \"Polk Salad Annie,\" \"Route 66\" and an amazing take on the\nold Kenny Rogers atrocity \"Ruby, Don't Take Your Love To Town.\" Hopefully they'll collect all of\nthese one day.\n\nJason's 1992 solo album, One Foot in the Honky Tonk is also out of print."
