    "text": "Q:\n\nTranslate this quote from The Producers?\n\nIn the Broadway play The Producers (and subsequent movie), the character Max Bialystock recalls a quote from his dying mentor. He says it's in Yiddish, but more than one person has told me that, in fact, it's German. I don't speak either, so please bear with me.\nLinked here is the exact location in this video where he says the words. I will also attempt a transliteration, though it will certainly be inaccurate:\n\nAlle mensche musse machen, haden tugagatzen kashen pichen pippin\n  kachen.\n\nInitial research shows that it is not a high-minded quote, and coming from Mel Brooks, it's bound to be comedic in nature. No lyrics sites I found have the entire quote written out, they shorten it for some reason (probably all copying from one bad source).\n\nA:\n\nI'm pretty sure second half is babbling, as people have suggested.  The OP has given:\n\"...haden tugagatzen kashen pichen pippin kachen.\"\nI would transliterate it a bit differently:\n\"...heden to the gantzen kasha'n pischen pippik kachen.\"\n\"Heden\" isn't a word. \"Kasha\" (buckwheat groats) is the iconic food of poverty in Jewish culture, and it is here juxtaposed ungrammatically with the word for \"pissing\". This is also in close proximity to \"kachen\", which is probably supposed to be \"kacken\" (to defedcate) altered to rhyme with \"machen\".\nFinally, the \"pippik\" is the belly-button, and it is universally considered a funny word in Yiddish. One of its most picturesque applications is in the following couplet taken from Isaac Rosenfeld's Yiddish paroday of t.s. eliots' \"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\":\n\"Ich wer' (=werde) alt, ich wer' alt\nUn der pippik wert mir kalt.\"\n\n"
