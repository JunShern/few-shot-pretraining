    "text": "February 6, 2003\n\nSurvival of the Students\n\nYou\u2019ve seen those Worst Case Scenario Guides they have going around. They tell you how to jump out of a plane or escape from quicksand. But what good is that going to do the typical college student? However, there are situations when we all could have used a little guidance. So here\u2019s the daze take on Worst Case Scenario: Cornell.\n\nYour car is old, the hill is large\n\nFirst of all, whatever you do, don\u2019t go up Buffalo. Or Seneca. Unless you have to, and eventually, you probably will. If you\u2019re in an automatic, you probably have several different gears (under Drive it should say either 4, 3, 2, 1 or L1, L2). Put your car in a lower gear to get up the hill. If you\u2019re in a manual, shifting to a lower gear should still help.\n\nYour battery is dead\n\nA quick lesson on how to jump a car. You need two cars. This cannot be overstated. Get your friend or a stranger or whoever to park their car so that it forms the top of a T, with your car forming the vertical line, leaving enough room for you to walk in between the two. If you\u2019re on the street instead of a parking lot you can also put the second car parallel to yours. Open the hood of your car. Open the hood of the other car. Locate the battery on both. Always starting from the live car, attach the cables plus to plus and minus to minus. After you attach the last cable, turn on the dead car. The battery should jump. Take off the cables, check to make sure there are no foreign objects in there and close the hood. Drive the car around for at least a half an hour or until the battery rating is above 14.\n\nThe cornell curse strikes\n\nThere are approximately 19,000 students at Cornell (undergrad and grad). It\u2019s inevitable that the person you\u2019re talking about will be standing right behind you. What do you do? You have several options. You can pretend you knew the person was there the entire time: \u201cJohn\u2019s really a pretentious ass \u2014 aren\u2019t you, John?\u201d You can pretend that you\u2019re talking about someone else who has \u2014 get this \u2014 the exact same name: \u201cOh no, I meant the other Toshie Kelly Gomyo.\u201d You can attempt to negate the insult by attaching a qualifier to the end: \u201cYeah, she\u2019s a dog \u2014 if Grace Kelly is.\u201d If you\u2019re\n\nThis is the \"wpengine\" admin user that our staff uses to gain access to your admin area to provide support and troubleshooting.

As a second semester senior, I\u2019ve decided that I deserve to have the Spring Break of a sorority girl\u2019s (or drunkard\u2019s) dreams. As such, I have set my sights on Acapulco. After extensive research, I\u2019ve found not a single airline that will bursar it. So, how to get the cash? Well, I\u2019ve taken on a second job. I work at the Pita Pit 10 to 12 hours a week for Acapulco money. Don\u2019t get me wrong; I like my job. My co-workers are nice, I ring in people\u2019s orders and make sandwiches. It\u2019s not a bad way to make some change. There\u2019s nothing wrong with asking \u201cDo you want chips with that\u201d for a semester in the service of a debauched dream. But the thing I\u2019ve learned that I\u2019ll forever carry with me is this: sometimes, the customer is always wrong. The customer is always wrong when she, a 92-pound girl, asks me if she can have a third baba ganoush, a third hummus and a third falafel on her sandwich. And just a little lettuce. And no pita. He\u2019s always wrong when he calls me asking why his 222 chicken pitas haven\u2019t yet been delivered when he ordered over an hour ago. Has he ever made 222 chicken pitas? Does he know how long it takes to make 222 chicken pitas? Should he just smoke another bowl with his 221 buddies and relax? Finally, the customer is especially wrong when he or she puts in an appearance as The Drunk Customer. The Drunk Customer is a unique specimen. Both sexes look the same, for the most part. They are clothed in expensive outfits which must have looked good at the beginning of the night, but are now beginning to \u2014 for lack of a better word \u2014 wilt. Gelled hair has gone limp, and has chosen to part listlessly in the middle. Mascara has smeared above and underneath the eye. Beer has been spilt, usually on or near the crotch area of the pant. I will begin by describing my encounters with the male. Often staggering in with 48 of his closest friends, he begins his night at the Pita Pit aiming his beady, bloodshot eyes at my chest and smirkingly slurring out the words: \u201cWhaza BLT?\u201d Next, he proceeds to do one of three things: He invites everyone in the Pit to after-hours at his place. He asks the location of the bathroom. Unable to wait for a response, he rushes outside and pees in the snow. He asks the location of the bathroom. Unable to wait for a response, he rushes outside and pukes in the snow. Then, if he is able, he returns and orders a pita. Or two. Or FIVE. Oh yes, The Male Drunk Customer can eat. Let\u2019s turn now to the female. She pays with someone else\u2019s credit card \u2014 usually a close relative\u2019s \u2014 which happens to have her name on it. I know this because when I say \u201c$28.50, please,\u201d she says, \u201cOh, that\u2019ll break my father\u2019s bank.\u201d One can only hope that in a mere five weeks I too will be drunk enough to say something even stupider. Possibilities include: \u201cGreen things are better than blue things,\u201d \u201cWhy don\u2019t birds fly inside?\u201d and \u201cWhat are you doing later?\u201dArchived article by Maggie Frank\n\nThe Dartmouth Jinx? Like Bigfoot and Area 51, some say it exists and some say it doesn\u2019t. The icers themselves don\u2019t believe in it. It has nothing to do with Dartmouth, say the players and coaches, it\u2019s just a bad coincidence that the Red hasn\u2019t played high-caliber hockey against the Green. \u201cWe lost to them a lot of times, but why did we lose to Colgate?\u201d asked senior co-captain Doug Murray. \u201cWe didn\u2019t play a good game.\u201d \u201cWe haven\u2019t come out with a fire in our stomach and aggressiveness, and you go back in a lot of the notes I have, our effort, especially early on in the game, has been very disappointing,\u201d said head coach Mike Schafer \u201986. Other members of the team won\u2019t even discuss the jinx. \u201cI\u2019m not answering any questions about Dartmouth,\u201d stated senior co-captain Stephen B"
