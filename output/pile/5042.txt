Kat Broderick put together a couple of quotes of his on the matter. (Via)\n\nIn her Try it out Tuesdays-series, Tara Stiles suggests to just be kind to people one whole day long. Probably more difficult than it sounds?\n\nNaturally, not only left-handed females are underpaid: According to a study by Georgetown University, women need a PhD to earn as much as men with Bachelor degrees. According to the study, on average women earn 25% percent less than men. Source and more info. (Via.)\n\nHave you got globetrotter genes? Milk put together a list of things to know for people who are thinking about moving to L.A.\n\nAri of Advanced Style has asked a 99-year-old lady for her life advice. Tips include classics like \"Never loan, never borrow\" and fancier Upper East Side-y stuff like \"Don't frequent a restaurant where they don't crumb the table\".\n\nAug 21, 2011\n\nVeggie Love, a German blog edited by vegan Franziska Schmid, is still celebrating its first birthday with a wonderful blog parade: Everyday, different bloggers are portrayed who share their opinion on Veggie Love. Amongst the congratulants are also Susanne and myself (in English, just scroll down a tad bit). Remember, we developed the GCB tote bags together - and named one after Franziska! If you're interested in a sustainable lifestyle at all and can read some German, check out Franziska's posse.\n\nAug 20, 2011\n\nOne week ago today, 3000 people took to the streets in Berlin to protest against sexist discrimination. (Think Christopher Street Day for women's rights.) I was there - as were plenty of other Girls On Web Society members. If you like, please follow the jump for a collection of some of their posts.\n\nAug 18, 2011\n\nI just accidentally deleted a whole post on this Gazpacho soup I made recently (grrr!) - and that my cat Frido stepped into a couple of minutes after I took this photo. Because it's late and I'm tired I won't rewrite everything that just went into digital nirvana now, please apologize. Let me just say that this cold raw vegetable soup that I prepared with my KitchenAid Artisan Blender has made it onto my Favorite Things to Eat of All Time list instantly! And for someone who enjoys cooking, that's really something. The blender performed perfectly at all times, and as per usual, cleaning it was super easy. For more photos, please follow the jump...\n\nAug 14, 2011\n\nThese are the three core questions of this year's 21 Day Meditation Challenge. The idea is to meditate for ten minutes every day over three weeks to get to know yourself better. To that end, you will receive free MP3 files with guided meditation instructions each day. Registration is quick and easy. I've never partaken before, but past participants wrote rave reviews and are eagerly awaiting tomorrow's start of this year's challenge. So why not try out something new for a change? This sounds easy enough. ;)\n\nAug 11, 2011\n\nLike announced last week, a couple of days ago I prepared the veggie burger featured in 24 hours a day, the KitchenAid blender cookbook. Despite a long list of ingredients, its preparation was fairly inexpensive (given you have a couple of basics like olive oil etc. at home) and the result tasted great. For more pictures and a German Bericht of my first ever veggie burger, please follow the jump.\n\nAug 8, 2011\n\nComing Saturday, August 13, the Slutwalk Berlin will take place. What sounds a little strange is a demonstration for women's rights that has been taking place the world over. (I think the last I've heard of was staged in New Delhi.) Nadine Lantzsch is one of the local organizers and is still looking for helping hands.\n\nJohanna shows us one of her favorite buildings in Germany: The Vitrahaus in Weil am Rhein.\n\nThis Vegan Life is proud of Duke University and the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill for adding Jonathan Safran Foer's book Eating Animals to their reading lists. Way to go!\n\nAug 7, 2011\n\nNever heard of the Be Body Positive Day? Me neither, until Anna Guest-Jelley featured it on her blog recently.

In any case, it's never too late to start loving your body! Find out more about the initiative at the body positive.\n\nAug 5, 2011\n\nA couple of months back I saw someone walk around my Berlin neighbourhood wearing a tote bag saying There's a special place in hell for fashion bloggers. It made me smile although I do like me my fashion blog every once in a while and don't believe in hell at all. Well, now I found the same slogan stitched onto some customized jeans vest and thought I'd share. If you're still looking for your own perfect tote bag, check out the GCB ones. Only last week, Franziska Schmid (whom I haven't seen in way too long) unpacked hers and put her favorite every day items on display: Bloggerinnen It Bag!\n\nAug 4, 2011\n\nWith my KitchenAid Artisan Blender also came the German version of a KitchenAid Blender Cookbook. Along the lines of its English language counterpart \"24 hours a day\"the book is entitled \"Rund um die Uhr\". Quite obviously, the idea is to show that a blender is useful for the preparation of most any meal or drink - no matter what time of the day, whether it's breakfast, lunch, dinner, baby food or cocktails. For a German Einsch\u00e4tzung whether this cookbook is of any use at all (it is!) and whether it's also suitable for vegetarians like my humble self (it is!), please follow the jump!\n\nAug 1, 2011\n\nThis is one of a series of awesome photographies of dogs shaking off water. Carli Davidson, the photographer, is based in Portland, Oregon, has previously worked at the local zoo and has specialised in animal photography.
