Mandatory Credit: Kim Klement-USA TODAY Sports\n\nAs if the Tampa Bay Lightning defeating the in-state rival Florida Panthers by a score of 7-2 wasn\u2019t enough, the fans in Tampa got to witness something that they haven\u2019t seen in quite some time; a hat trick comprised of three completely different types of goals.\n\nStamkos\u2019 first goal of the night was a shorthanded one. At that particular moment in time, Richard Panik sat in the box for 2 minutes for High Sticking, Stamkos and St. Louis made their way down the ice, and Stamkos was able to fire off a shot that made its way between the pipes with assists from the captain Martin St. Louis and defenseman Victor Hedman.\n\nAbout halfway through the next period, Stamkos would strike again; this time at full strength. The assists on this goal came from assistant captain Matt Carle and left wing Ryan Malone.\n\nThe icing on the puck shaped cake came at 12:25 in the third period while Panthers center Jesse Winchester sat in the box for 2 minutes for Hooking, Stamkos was able to make his way down the ice and knock in another, bringing the Bolts up 7-2 with the assists from Sami Salo and Teddy Purcell.\n\nIn case you didn\u2019t have the privilege of seeing this live, or even on television, here is a piece by piece look at Steven Stamkos\u2019 hatty from Thursday night at the Tampa Bay Times Forum.\n\nNext, the Tampa Bay Lightning continue their 7-game home stand tonight against Evgeni Malkin and the Pittsburgh Penguins.\n\nBe sure to stay up-to-date with all the latest Lightning news and updates with Bolts By the Bay.
