    "text": "Cheesecake recipes are a dime a dozen on the keto diet. They\u2019re the perfect low carb, high fat food \u2013 being comprised primarily of delicious cream cheese \u2013 so they\u2019re a common go-to for a keto-friendly dessert. However, most of the cheesecake recipes I\u2019ve tried have seemed a little\u2026 off. They had a funky texture or you could taste the fake sugars in them. And let\u2019s not even get started on no-bake or jello cheesecakes\u2026 I am a cheesecake connoisseur over here, and if you\u2019re going to take the time to make a cheesecake, it needs to be a big and dense New York-style concoction.\n\nGrowing up, I was inundated with desserts in my family. My Gran-Gran, Meemaw, mom, and a veritable slew of aunts and great-aunts can cook almost anything. But the one thing that no one in my family had perfected was cheesecake. So a few years ago, when my Mom asked for one for her birthday, I set out to become the lone cheesecake cook.\n\nLet\u2019s just say we ate a lot of cheesecake in the week leading up to her birthday, and I hadn\u2019t really felt like making it since.\n\nBut I had totally perfected it.\n\nAnd so last week, when I began to think of what I could bake to take to our end-of-the-project bash at work and/or Easter with the family, my thoughts returned to that perfect, New York-style cheesecake. I dug up that original recipe and realized that I could alter it quite easily to fit low carb parameters. But would it taste the same, and would it have that same dense and creamy texture?\n\nSpoiler alert: it does.\n\nAllow me to go ahead and apologize for the pictures. I may have gotten a little\u2026 overzealous\u2026 with the whipped cream (as my cousin said, \u201cplaying Cheesecake Factory is my favorite game!\u201d). It was also dark and dreary and the lighting is meh. But whatever. Just hone in on that sweet, cold and creamy cake paired with those delectable, juicy and ripe red strawberries\u2026 and the mountains of whipped cream. But I digress.\n\nIngredients\n\nFor the crust,\n\n1/2c almond flour\n\n1/2c golden flaxmeal\n\n1/2c pecan pieces\n\n4T coconut oil\n\ncinnamon to taste\n\nSplenda or sweetener to taste\n\nFor the filling,\n\n4 8oz packages of cream cheese\n\n1c sour cream\n\n4 eggs\n\n1c Splenda, or equivalent sweetener of your choice\n\n3/4c heavy cream\n\n1/4c coconut flour\n\n1T vanilla extract\n\n3T sugarfree Torani syrup; this time I used French Vanilla (and next time I\u2019m totally going Salted Caramel)\n\nFirst things first, let\u2019s talk necessary kitchen equipment. For this cheesecake, you are going to need a springform pan. That\u2019s a pan that has a removable bottom, as pictured above. Think of the springform pan as more of a mold than a traditional cake pan. You cook the cheesecake in it, then remove it from around the cheesecake, hopefully without cracking the top. I like to lay a piece of parchment paper over the bottom part of the pan, then attach the ring around it so the paper peeks out around the sides. Then, when my cheesecake is done, I can transfer it easily to a serving plate while removing the side and bottom for easy cleanup.\n\nPreheat your oven to 400.\n\nCombine your pecan pieces, almond flour, flaxmeal, and coconut oil. Add sweetener and cinnamon to taste. If you add those to the crust, it flavors it like graham crackers, a nice nod to the more traditional cheesecake crust.\n\nYou may need to zap this concoction in the microwave if your coconut oil is solidified. The house I live in maintains a temperature roughly equivalent to hell, so I don\u2019t have to worry about that. Press the mixture firmly into the bottom of the springform pan. If you used parchment paper, you do not need to grease the bottom of the pan. If you didn\u2019t, butter that shit up.\n\nBake the crust until it turns a golden brown. Mine ranges from 5-8 minutes. I used to like to just use Caveman Keto\u2019s crust, but I decided to try to mix in some flaxmeal and I actually like this version better. It\u2019s more firm and less crumbly, which I prefer. It holds together better.\n\nOh, and yeah. While that is baking away, mix everything else together in your mixer. Or beat it with a mixer. Somehow incorporate all the ingredients into a flawless, creamy goodness. Then when the crust is done, grease up the sides of the springform pan and pour your mixture into it.\n\nSmooth the filling out as best you can. I like to tap the whole pan lightly on the counter to help it settle and to also help release air bubbles, which are a potential culprit of cracks. For some reason I did NOT tap this pan, and you can definitely tell in the end results. I wish I had pictures of the first cheesecake I made \u2013 it was gorgeous and crack-free. Ahh, you\u2019ll just have to take my word for it.\n\nSo let\u2019s talk some more about cracks. Cheesecakes are very sensitive, and if you don\u2019t bake them very very carefully, they can develop ugly cracks across the top. It\u2019s unattractive, and it\u2019s the goal of all cheesecake baking enthusiasts to produce a flawless cake. It\u2019s like, your status symbol, or something. The prime culprit for cracks is temperature fluctuations, and there are a few ways to combat this.\n\nNever bake your cheesecake hotter than 350. Low and slow is the way to go. In fact, since you just baked the crust at 400, leave the oven door open until it cools down. You don\u2019t want to stick it into a too-hot oven. Use a water bath. You can literally sit the springform pan in a pan of water. For these cheesecakes, I just placed a cake pan of water on the lower oven rack to steam and keep the oven moist. Don\u2019t over-beat the filling, because \u2013 as I mentioned before \u2013 too much air can cause cracking. I\u2019m not going to lie, I just let my KitchenAid run, so I like to let my filling sit in the springform pan for a good 10 minutes or so to settle some, before I tap it to let out even more air. Don\u2019t open the oven door while it\u2019s cooking. The sudden rush of cool air can cause cracks. Cut off the cheesecake at 50 minutes, and let it sit in the oven with the door shut for some time. Maybe an hour later, crack the oven door. Then a half hour after that, open it fully. And then remove the cheesecake, and run a knife along the edges of the pan to make sure that it\u2019s not stuck (although it shouldn\u2019t be if you greased it properly). The cheesecake shrinks as it cools, and if it\u2019s glommed onto the side of the pan, it will surely crack as it tries to pull away.\n\nSo again, bake your cheesecake at 350 for 50 minutes. If it doesn\u2019t look quite done, it\u2019s probably not \u2013 but it will continue to bake residually after you turn off the oven and begin the cooling-down process. It should be nicely browned by that point, though the center may look like it\u2019s not quite set. Trust me, after you get through with waiting for it to cool enough to handle safely, you\u2019ll have a beauty waiting on you.\n\nOr you might have something that looks like that. Yeah, so I didn\u2019t follow my own advice, and cheesecake numero dos \u2013 the one I shot for this blog \u2013 turned out kind of fugly. Ah, well. It was still delicious. You also have the luxury of disguising the ugliness by whipping up a fruit topping or covering it with a dark chocolate ganache. Since I served this one to my family at Easter, we just sliced it plain and topped it with strawberries.\n\nOh, and before I forget to tell you \u2013 stick this baby in the refrigerator and let it sit for several hours before you eat it. We had a slice of the first one after a few hours, and it was okay. But 12 hours later, it was a rockstar. For this second cake, I just popped it in the fridge overnight and allowed it to set up properly before Easter dinner. Although you\u2019ll want to chow down immediately, try to wait until it gets properly cold :) It\u2019s totally worth it!\n\nAnd let me tell you, even though Canadian Bacon and I are the only ketopians in the family, the cheesecake was a decisive hit. No one could tell that it was low carb. It didn\u2019t taste funny from the combo of Splenda and Torani. It was flavored throughout with a delicate vanilla, and paired wonderfully with the sweet berries and whipped cream. It was tall and thick and reminiscent of the pieces of plain cheesecake you get at The Cheesecake Factory. Forreals.\n\nMy Fitness Pal has changed the way you input recipes, so I can\u2019t post my typical ingredient log picture below. But at 8 servings, this cheesecake has 439 calories, 8g net carbs, 11g protein, and 38g fat per slice. It\u2019s very dense and creamy and filling. Hell, it\u2019s so low carb that my diabetic grandfather\u2019s bloodsugar crashed a couple of hours after eating a piece\u2026 seriously!\n\nIt\u2019s so good that my cats tried to eat it while I was taking photos of it.
