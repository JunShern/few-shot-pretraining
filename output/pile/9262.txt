On Thanet Canal, pretty houseboats compete for space with families of swans and ducks.\n\nBut on one weekend in September, people come from far and wide to see something else altogether \u2013 yarn!\n\nCelebrating creativity, colour and \u201call things woolly\u201d, Yarndale brings together producers, designers and textile artists in a festival dedicated to yarn in every imaginable form.\n\nMore than a kilometre of crocheted bunting decorates the ceiling inside Skipton Auction Mart, where exhibitors display their yarns in all the colours of the rainbow.\n\nBeautiful finished works create a collage of colour and texture. It\u2019s an Aladdin\u2019s cave of treasures for any crafter, and the possibilities are only limited by their imagination.\n\nElaine, it was almost overwhelming. I didn\u2019t know where to look first. The yarns were so beautiful and I was excited to see some projects I recognised from websites I follow. I loved the socks and would really like to try making a pair.\n\nI have some friends in Yorkshire who attend this event annually and also know of others who travel there especially for this event. It does sound lovely and your photos are the best I have seen of the lovely display of yarniness. Your creations would go well there! \ud83d\ude42\n\nThanks, CC. That\u2019s a great compliment considering the standard of work I saw. The festival is mostly exhibitors selling either their yarn, patterns and designs, or finished items. I didn\u2019t buy any but I was certainly tempted and inspired. Now I have a little. more knowledge, I would love to go again with a few ideas for what I would buy. How lucky are your friends.\n\nI had read about it online for a couple of years, and when we decided to go to England in September and then put Yorkshire on the itinerary I planned the whole five weeks so we were close by that weekend!\n\nMy mother would have LOVED this, Carol. She was always knitting and crocheting. In fact I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she actually visited this at one time or another \u2013 she often traveled the world looking for unique places like this xxxx\n\nIt\u2019s only been going for a few years Dianne, but there are probably other similar events which have been around a lot longer. She would have revelled in all the beautiful yarns. I\u2019ve never seen so many different ones."
