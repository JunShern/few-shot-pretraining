    "text": "10 Trap Songs That'll Get You Through Monday\n\nWhen 2 Chainz decided to name his upcoming album Pretty Girls Like Trap Music, he hadn\u2019t stumbled onto anything new and profound. But truth be told, a lot of people live for the grungy beats and carefree nature associated with the Southern-style of hip-hop. The more bass and slower the tempo, the better. In honor of April 7 release of Pretty Girls, we've compiled a list of 10 of our all-time favorite trap songs to get you hyped.\n\nTravis Scott \"Antidote\" Often confused for The Weeknd or ILoveMakonnen, Travis Scott dominated summer 2015 with the release of his hit, \u201cAntidote.\u201d Prior to the release of his debut album Rodeo, the up-and-coming rapper uploaded the single to his SoundCloud as a separate project thinking it would only be appreciated by his truest fans. But thanks to its stellar online reception, the Texas native decided to add the tune to Rodeo after all, and good thing he did \u2014 the single was certified double platinum.\n\nJidenna \"The Let Out\" We\u2019ll just come out and say it: Jidenna is the man. Not only is he quickly becoming one of the most respected hip-hop artists to date, but he seems to be the only one doing it while consistently rocking fancy suits. The Stanford graduate knows how to have fun and keep people dancing, and he does it all with an elaborate vocab and the freshest threads on the market. But don\u2019t let his wardrobe fool you \u2014 he\u2019ll get down and dance it out, too.\n\nWaka Flocka Flame \"No Hands\" When he isn\u2019t going \u201cHard In Da Paint,\u201d Waka Flocka is going H.A.M. on a bottle of Moscato. While there no actual research to support it, the Georgia native is probably solely responsible for the direct increase in sales of the wine thanks to his 2010 club banger, \u201cNo Hands.\u201d With a little help from Wale and Roscoe Dash, the Flockaveli hit reached Number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Though the Kel Mitchell doppelganger is known for his wilder, dreadlock-shaking ways, the the leisurely, late summer tune is a nice change of pace.\n\nKenrick Lamar \"Humble\" Just when fans thought they knew Kendrick Lamar as an artist, he returned with \u201cHumble\u201d and everyone lost their minds. Not only is the lead single off of the upcoming \u2014 still untitled \u2014 fourth album a demonstration of rhythmic capability, but also a hard glance at Lamar\u2019s lyrical superiority. Beyond that, what fans love most about the track is its depth and honesty, as the rapper not only finds the time to call out fake artists, but also fits in his praises for natural beauty and stretch marks in one fell swoop. Boom.\n\nMigos \"Bad and Boujee\" Although better lyrics could\u2019ve been written by a middle schooler with a rhyming dictionary, Migos\u2019 2016 \u201cBad and Boujee\u201d has still managed to flood every playlist and DJ set around. The inescapable track, featuring Lil Uzi Vert, might actually be one of the first songs to ever be made popular after the lyrics were frequently used in memes. For those who weren\u2019t previously aware of the \u201craindrop, drop top\u201d internet phenomenon, now you know.\n\nRead on for more essential trap songs from Rae Sremmurd, Desiigner, and T.I.\n\nRae Sremmurd \"Come Get Her\" Long before \u201cBlack Beatles\u201d and the Mannequin Challenge, Rae Sremmurd was still riding the high from the success of their debut album SremmLife. Brothers Swae Lee and Slim Jxmmy already had four other singles that had gone platinum and made it to the top of the Billboard charts, and the release of 2015\u2019s \u201cCome Get Her\u201d was no different. The Mississippi duo has put out hit after hit, and from the looks of it, isn\u2019t slowing down anytime soon.\n\nFuture \"I Thought It Was a Drought\" If there was an award dedicated to random lyrical insults, excessive partying, and autotune use, Future would be first choice for recipient. The unapologetic rapper\u2019s song off of 2015\u2019s DS2 features one of the most iconic choruses in all of trap music, with its sleepy beat carrying the descriptions of luxury, extravagant drug usage and infidelity casually along as though it\u2019s no big deal. While many wish they could party with Future, realistically they wouldn\u2019t be able to keep up with the Atlanta rapper\u2019s lifestyle.\n\nDesiigner \"Panda\" If the Grand Theft Auto franchise had an official theme song, it would be Desiigner\u2019s 2015 whirlwind hit, \u201cPanda.\u201d Sounding like a less sedated version of Future, the New York native found fame via the good old method: YouTube. Days after \u201cPanda\u201d was uploaded to the video sharing site and his SoundCloud account, he gained the attention of Kanye West, who immediately signed him to his GOOD Music label. The debut single went on to be featured on Kanye\u2019s most anticipated album, The Life of Pablo.\n\nIf you like this story, consider signing up for our email newsletters.\n\nSHOW ME HOW\n\nNewsletters\n\nSUCCESS!\n\nYou have successfully signed up for your selected newsletter(s) - please keep an eye on your mailbox, we're movin' in!\n\nT.I. \"What You Know\" Throwing it back a ways, no trap music playlist is complete without the King of Southern rap, Mr. T.I.P. \u201cWhat You Know,\u201d the 2006 lead single off of his fourth studio album King, not only reached Number 3 on the Billboard Top 100 chart, but was certified double platinum. After being featured on the soundtrack for the hit movie ATL, people couldn\u2019t listen to the song without feeling a little bit edgy and cool. After all, who else was \u201csitting pretty\u201d and trying making Louis Vuitton knapsacks a thing?\n\n2 Chainz \"It\u2019s A Vibe\" Normally upbeat and raunchy, Georgia boy 2 Chainz slowed it down for his collaboration with Ty Dolla Sign, Trey Songz, and Jhen\u00e9 Aiko on \u201cIt\u2019s a Vibe\" on 2017\u2019s Pretty Girls Like Trap Music. In preparation for the album\u2019s release, the wearer of multiple necklaces enlisted the help of pretty girls like Lauren London, Karrueche Tran, and Erykah Badu to create their own preferred trap music playlists that he featured on Spotify. Not only is he one of the tallest rappers in the game, but he\u2019s also one of the smartest \u2014 not many rappers have been invited to CNN to debate important matters, like the legalization of marijuana. However, until he\u2019s officially sworn in as governor, we\u2019ll just keep dancing to his music."
