    "text": "The Microsoft Translator webpage widget allows you to bring real-time, in-place translations to your web site. Try the new collaborative translation features that combine automatic translation technology with the power of your community.\nLanguage translation is extremely difficult, as the meaning of words and phrases often depends on the context and specialized knowledge of the domain area or culture. Sentence structures and grammatical rules vary significantly between two languages, which adds to the complexity of the translation challenge. Currently, it still requires human skills to translate sentences without errors. The quality of today's most advanced translation software is well below the accuracy and fluency of a professional translator, and many sentences are simply not understandable. Researchers are continuously working on improvements, but it may be many years before high quality translation can be consistently offered by a computer. For this reason, we display both the original text and its translation, anticipating that you will find it easier to understand the translation and to compare it with the original content if needed.\nText translation\n* Select your original and translation language from the \"Languages\" drop down box.\n* Type or paste your text in the \"Enter text or webpage URL\" box.\n* Click the \"Translate\" button.\nWeb page translation\n* Select your original and translation language from the \"Languages\" drop down box.\n* Enter the URL of a web page in the \"Enter text or webpage URL\" box.\n* Click the \"Translate\" button.\n* Once in the Bilingual Viewer, you can change viewing modes, target language, or URL by clicking on the controls in the menu bar."
