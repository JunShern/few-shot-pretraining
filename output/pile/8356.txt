Over the years, new results have been discovered, see [@CNS]. However, it has been hard to construct groups acting on $\\Bbb{P}^2_\\Bbb{C}$ which are neither virtually affine nor complex hyperbolic. In this article we use the irreducible representation $\\iota$ of $\\PSL(2,\\Bbb{C})$ into $\\PSL(3,\\Bbb{C})$ to produce such groups, more precisely, we show:\n\nLet $\\Gamma\\subset \\PSL(2,\\Bbb{C})$ be a discrete group of the first kind with non-empty discontinuity region in the Riemann sphere. Then the following claims are equivalent:\n\n1.  The group $\\Gamma$ is Fuchsian.\n\n2.  The group $\\iota\\Gamma$ is complex hyperbolic.\n\n3.  The group $\\iota\\Gamma$ is $\\Bbb{R}$-Fuchsian.\n\nBefore we present our next result we should recall the following definition, see [@lab] page 30. A group $G$ is called a [*compact surface group*]{}, if it is isomorphic to the fundamental group of a compact orientable topological surface $\\Sigma_g$ of genus $g \\geq 2$.\n\n\\[t:main2\\] Let $\\Sigma_g$ a compact orientable topological surface $\\Sigma_g$ of genus $g \\geq 2$ and $\\rho_0: \\Pi_{1}(\\Sigma_g)\\rightarrow \\PO^+(2,1)$ be a faithful discrete representation, where $\\PO^+(2,1)$ denotes the projectivization of identity component of $\\O(2,1)$. Then we can find a sequence of discrete faithful representations $\\rho_n:  \\Pi_{1}(\\Sigma_g)\\rightarrow \\PSL(3,\\Bbb{C})$ such that:\n\n1.  For each $n\\in \\Bbb{N}$ the group $\\rho_n(\\Pi_1(\\Sigma_g))=\\Gamma_n$ is a complex Kleinian group whose action on $\\Bbb{P}^2_{\\Bbb{C}}$ is irreducible.\n\n2.  For each $n\\in \\Bbb{N}$ the group $\\Gamma_n$ is not conjugate to a subgroup of $\\PU(2,1)$ or $\\PSL(3,\\Bbb{R})$.\n\n3.  The sequence of representations $(\\rho_n)$ converge algebraically to $\\Gamma_0$, [*i. e.*]{} $lim_n \\rho_n(\\gamma)=h$ exists as a projective transformation for all $\\gamma\\in \\Pi_1(\\Sigma_g)$ and $\\Gamma_0=\\{h:lim_n\\rho_n(\\gamma)=h, \\gamma\\in \\Pi_1(\\Sigma_g) \\}$ compare with the corresponding definition in [@JM].\n\n4.  The sequence $(\\Gamma_n)$ of compact surface groups converge geometrically to $\\Gamma_0$, [*i. e.*]{} if for every subsequence $(j_n)$ of $(n)$ we get $$\\Gamma_0=\\{g\\in \\PSL(3,\\Bbb{C}):g=lim_{j_n}\\rho_{j_n}(\\gamma_n), \\gamma_n\\in \\Pi_1(\\Sigma_g)\\},$$ compare with the corresponding definition in [@JM].\n\nThere are complex Kleinian groups acting on $\\Bbb{P}^2_{\\Bbb{C}}$ which are neither conjugate to complex hyperbolic groups nor virtually affine groups.\n\nThis paper is organized as follows: in Section \\[s:recall\\] we review some general facts and introduce the notation used throughout the text. In Section \\[s:gever\\] we describe some properties of the Veronese curve which are useful for our purposes. In Section \\[s:chvh\\] we characterize the complex hyperbolic subgroups that leave invariant a Veronese curve. In Section \\[s:riv\\] we depict those real hyperbolic subgroups leaving invariant a Veronese curve. Finally, in Section \\[s:rep\\] we show that every discrete compact surface group in $\\PO(2,1)^+$ admits a deformation in $\\PSL(3,\\Bbb{C})$ which is not conjugate to a complex hyperbolic subgroup and has non-empty Kulkarni region of discontinuity.\n\nPreliminaries {#s:recall}\n=============\n\nProjective geometry\n-------------------\n\nThe complex projective space $\\mathbb{P}^2_{\\mathbb {C}}$ is defined as $$\\mathbb{P}^{2}_{\\mathbb {C}}=(\\mathbb {C}^{3}\\setminus \\{0\\})/\\Bbb{C}^*,$$ where $\\Bbb{C}^*$ acts by the usual scalar multiplication. This is a compact connected complex $2$-dimensional manifold. If $[\\mbox{}]:\\mathbb{C}^{3}\\setminus\\{0\\}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{P}^{2}_{\\mathbb{C}}$ is the quotient map, then a non-empty set $H\\subset\\mathbb{P}^2_{\\mathbb{C}}$ is said to be a line if there is a $\\mathbb{C}$-linear subspace $\\widetilde{H}$ in $\\mathbb{C}^{3}$ of dimension $2$ such that $[\\widetilde{H}\\setminus \\{0\\}]=H$. If $p,q$ are distinct points then $\\overleftrightarrow{p,q}$ is the unique complex line passing through them. In this article, $e_1,e_2,e_{3}$ will denote the standard basis for $\\Bbb{C}^{3}$.\n\n Projective transformations \n----------------------------\n\nThe group of projective automorphisms of $\\mathbb{P}^{2}_{\\mathbb{C}}$ is defined as $$\\PSL(3, \\mathbb {C}) \\,:=\\, \\GL({3}, \\Bbb{C})/\\Bbb{C}^*,$$ where $\\Bbb{C}^*$ acts by the usual scalar multiplication. Then $\\PSL(3, \\mathbb{C})$ is a Lie group acting by biholomorphisms on $\\Bbb{P}^2_{\\Bbb{C}}$; its elements are called projective transformations. We denote by $[[\\mbox{  }]]: \\GL(3,\\mathbb{C})\\rightarrow \\PSL(3,\\mathbb{C})$ the quotient map. Given $ \\gamma\\in\\PSL(3, \\mathbb{C})$, we say that $\\widetilde\\gamma\\in\\GL(3,\\mathbb {C})$ is a [*lift*]{} of $ \\gamma$ if $[[\\widetilde\\gamma]]=\\gamma$.\\\n\nComplex hyperbolic groups\n-------------------------\n\nIn the rest of this paper, we will be interested in studying those subgroups of $\\PSL(3,\\Bbb{C})$ that preserve the unitary complex ball. We start by considering the following Hermitian matrix: $$H=\n\\left (\n\\begin{array}{lll}\n  &&1\\\\\n  &1&\\\\\n1&&\n\\end{array}\n\\right ).$$ We will set $$\\U(2,1)=\\{g\\in \\GL(3,\\Bbb{C}):g^*Hg^*=H\\}$$ $$\\O(2,1)=\\{g\\in \\GL(3,\\Bbb{R}):g^t Hg=H\\}$$\n\nand $\\langle,\\rangle:\\Bbb{C}^{3}\\rightarrow \\Bbb{C}$ the Hermitian form induced by $H$. Clearly, $\\langle,\\rangle$ has signature $(2,1)$ and $\\U(2,1)$ is the group that preserves $\\langle,\\rangle$, see [@goldman]. The projectivization $\\PU(2,1)$ preserves the unitary complex ball: $$\\Bbb{H}^2_\\Bbb{C}=\\{[w]\\in \\Bbb{P}^2_{\\Bbb{C}}\\mid \\langle w,w\\rangle <0\\}.$$ Given a subgroup $\\Gamma\\subset\\PU(2,1)$, we define the following notion of limit set, as in [@CG].\n\nLet $\\Gamma\\subset \\PU(2,1)$, then its Chen\u2013Greenberg limit set is $\\Lambda_{\\CG}(\\Gamma):= \\bigcup \\overline{\\Gamma x}\\cap \\partial \\Bbb{H}^2_\\Bbb{C}$ where the union on the right runs over all points $x\\in \\Bbb{H}^2_\\Bbb{C}$.\n\nAs in the Fuchsian groups case, $\\Lambda_{\\CG}(\\Gamma)$ has either 1, 2 or infinitely many points. A group is said to be non-elementary if $\\Lambda_{\\CG}(\\Gamma)$ has infinitely many points, and in that case it does not depend on the choice of orbit, [*i.e.*]{} $\\Lambda_{\\CG}(\\Gamma):= \\overline{\\Gamma x}\\cap \\partial \\Bbb{H}^2_\\Bbb{C}$ where $x\\in \\Bbb{H}^2_\\Bbb{C}$ is any point.\\\n\n Pseudo-projective transformations\n----------------------------------\n\nThe space of linear transformations from $\\Bbb{C}^{3}$ to $\\Bbb{C}^{3}$, denoted by $M(3,\\Bbb{C})$, is a complex linear space of dimension $9$, where $\\GL(3,\\Bbb{C})$ is an open dense set in $ M(3,\\Bbb{C})$. Then $\\PSL(3,\\Bbb{C})$ is an open dense set in $QP(3,\\Bbb{C})=(M(3,\\Bbb{C})\\setminus\\{0 \\})/\\Bbb{C}^*$ called in [@CS] the space of pseudo-projective maps. Let $\\widetilde{M}:\\mathbb{C}^{3}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{C}^{3}$ be a non-zero linear transformation. Let $Ker(\\widetilde M)$ be its kernel and $Ker([[\\widetilde M]])$ denote its projectivization. Then $\\widetilde{M}$ induces a well defined map $[[\\widetilde M]]:\\mathbb {P}^{2}_\\mathbb {C}\\setminus Ker([[\\widetilde M]]) \\rightarrow\\mathbb {P}^{2}_\\mathbb {C}$ by $$[[\\widetilde M]]([v])=[\\widetilde M(v)].$$ The following result provides a relation between convergence in $QP(3,\\Bbb{C})$ viewed as points in a projective space and the convergence viewed as functions.\n\n\\[See [@CS]\\] \\[p:completes\\] Let $(\\gamma_m)_{m\\in \\mathbb {N}}\\subset \\PSL(3,\\mathbb {C})$ be a sequence of distinct elements. Then:\n\n1.  There is a subsequence $(\\tau_m)_{m\\in \\mathbb {N}}\\subset(\\gamma_m)_{m\\in\\mathbb{N}}$ and a $\\tau_0\\in M(3,\\Bbb{C})\\setminus\\{0\\}$ such that $\\tau_m\\xymatrix{\\ar[r]_{m\\rightarrow\\infty}&}\\tau_0$ as points in $QP(3,\\Bbb{C})$.\n\n2.  If $(\\tau_m)_{m\\in \\mathbb {N}}$ is the sequence given by the previous part of this lemma, then $\\tau_m\\xymatrix{\\ar[r]_{m\\rightarrow\\infty}&}\\tau_0$, as functions, uniformly on compact sets of $\\mathbb{P}^n_\\mathbb{C}\\setminus Ker(\\tau_0)$. Moreover, the equicontinuity set of $\\{\\tau_m\\vert m\\in \\Bbb{N} \\}$ is $\\Bbb{P}^n\\setminus Ker(\\tau_0)$.\n\nKulkarni\u2019s limit set\n--------------------\n\nWhen we look at the action of a group acting on a general topological space, in general there is no natural notion of limit set. A nice starting point is Kulkarni\u2019s limit set.\n\n\\[d:lim\\] Let $\\Gamma\\subset\\PSL(n+1,\\mathbb{C})$ be a subgroup. We define\n\n1.  the set $\\Lambda(\\Gamma)$ to be the closure of the set of cluster points of $\\Gamma z$ as $z$ runs over $\\mathbb{P}^n_{\\mathbb{C}}$,\n\n2.  the set $L_2(\\Gamma)$ to be the closure of cluster points of $\\Gamma K$ as $K$ runs over all the compact sets in $\\mathbb{P}^n_{\\mathbb{C}}\\setminus \\Lambda(\\Gamma)$,\n\n3.  and *Kulkarni\u2019s limit set* of $\\Gamma$ to be $$\\Lambda_{\\Kul}(\\Gamma)=\\Lambda(\\Gamma)\\cup L_2(\\Gamma),$$\n\n4.  *Kulkarni\u2019s discontinuity region* of $\\Gamma$ to be $$\\Omega_{\\Kul}(\\Gamma)=\\mathbb{P}^n_{\\mathbb{C}}\\setminus\\Lambda_{\\Kul}(\\Gamma).$$\n\nKulkarni\u2019s limit set has the following properties. For a more detailed discussion of this in the two-dimensional setting, see [@CNS].\n\n\\[p:pkg\\] Let $\\Gamma\\subset \\PSL(3,\\Bbb{C})$ be a complex Kleinian group. Then:\n\n1.  The sets\\[i:pk2\\] $\\Lambda_{\\Kul}(\\Gamma),\\,\\Lambda(\\Gamma),\\,L_2(\\Gamma)$ are $\\Gamma$-invariant closed sets.\n\n2.  \\[i:pk3\\] The group $\\Gamma$ acts properly discontinuously on $\\Omega_{\\Kul}(\\Gamma)$.\n\n3.  \\[i:pk4\\] If $\\Gamma$ does not have any projective invariant subspaces, then $$\\Omega_{\\Kul}(\\Gamma)=Eq(\\Gamma).$$ Moreover, $\\Omega_{\\Kul}(\\Gamma)$ is complete Kobayashi hyperbolic and is the largest open set on which the group acts properly discontinuously.\n\n The Geometry of the Veronese Curve {#s:gever}\n===================================\n\nNow let us define the Veronese embedding. Set $$\\begin{array}{l}\n\\psi:\\Bbb{P}^1_\\Bbb{C}\\rightarrow \\Bbb{P}^2_\\Bbb{C}\\\\\n\\psi([z,w])=[z^2,2zw, w^2].\n\\end{array}$$\n\nLet us consider $\\iota: \\PSL(2,\\Bbb{C})\\rightarrow \\PSL(3,\\Bbb{C})$ given by $$\\iota\\left(\\frac{az+b}{cz+d}\\right )=\\left [\\left [\n\\begin{array}{lll}\na^2&ab&b^2\\\\\n2ac&ad+bc&2bd\\\\\nc^2&dc&d^2\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\right ]\\right ].$$ Trivially, $\\iota$ is well defined. Note that this map is induced by the canonical action of $\\SL(2,\\Bbb{C})$ on the space of homogeneous polynomials of degree two in two complex variables.\n\n\\[l:mor\\] The map $\\iota$ is an injective group morphism.\n\nLet $$A=\\left [\\left [\n\\begin{array}{ll}\na&b\\\\\nc&d\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\right ]\\right ],\\,B=\\left [\\left [\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n e&f\\\\\ng&h\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\right ]\\right ]\\in\\PSL(2,\\Bbb{C}).$$ Then\n\n$$\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\iota (AB)\n&=\\iota\\left [\\left [\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n ae+bg&af+bh\\\\\nce+dg&cf+dh\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\right ]\\right ]\\\\\n&=\\left [\\left [\n\\begin{array}{lll}\n (ae+bg)^2&(ae+bg)(af+bh)&( af+bh)^2\\\\\n2(ae+bg)(ce+dg)&(cf+dh)(ae+bg)+(af+bh)(ce+dg)&2(af+bh)(cf+dh)\\\\\n(ce+dg)^2&2(ce+dg)(cf+dh)&(cf+dh)^2\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\right ]\\right ]\\\\\n&=\\left [\\left [\n\\begin{array}{lll}\n a^2&ab&b^2\\\\\n2bc&ad+bc&2bd\\\\\nc^2&cd&d^2\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\right ]\\right ]\\left [\\left [\n\\begin{array}{lll}\n e^2&ef&f^2\\\\\n2eg&eh+fg&2fh\\\\\ng^2&gh&h^2\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\right ]\\right ]\\\\\n&=\\iota(A)\\iota(B).\n\\end{array}$$\n\nTherefore $\\iota$ is a group morphism. Now suppose $A=[[a_{ij}]]\\in \\PSL(2,\\Bbb{C})$ is such that $\\iota(A)=Id$. Then $$\\left [\\left [\n\\begin{array}{lll}\n a^2_{11}&a_{11}a_{12}&a^2_{12}\\\\\n2a_{12}a_{21}&a_{11}a_{22}+a_{12}a_{21} &2a_{12}a_{21}\\\\\na_{21}^2&a_{21}a_{22}&a_{22}^2\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\right ]\\right ]\n=\\left [\\left [\n\\begin{array}{lll}\n1&0&0\\\\\n0&1&0\\\\\n0&0&1\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\right ]\\right ]$$ and so we conclude $a_{12}=a_{21}=0$. Since $a_{11}a_{22}-a_{12}a_{21}=1$, we deduce $a_{11}^2=a_{22}^2=1$, [*i.e.*]{} $A=Id$, which concludes the proof.\n\nThe morphism $\\iota$ is type preserving. In particular, if $\\Gamma\\subset\\PSL(2,\\Bbb{C})$ is a discrete subgroup, we must have $\\iota(\\Gamma)$ is a discrete group such that each element is strongly loxodromic.\n\nHere, by type preserving, we mean that $\\iota$ carries elliptic elements into elliptic elements, and similarly for loxodromic and parabolic elements.\n\nConsider $$A=\n\\left [\\left [\n\\begin{array}{ll}\na&0\\\\\n0&a^{-1}\n\\end{array}\n\\right ]\\right ],\\,B=\n\\left [ \\left [\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n1&1\\\\\n0&1\n\\end{array}\n\\right ]\\right ]\\in\\PSL(2,\\Bbb{C}).$$ A straightforward calculation shows $$\\iota(A)=\n\\left [\\left [\n\\begin{array}{lll}\na^2&0&0\\\\\n0&1&0\\\\\n0&0&a^{-2}\n\\end{array}\n\\right ]\\right ],\\,\\iota(B)=\n\\left [ \\left [\n\\begin{array}{lll}\n1&1&1\\\\\n0&1&0\\\\\n0&0&1\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\right ]\\right ].$$ This shows that $\\iota$ is type preserving. Now let $$A_n=\n\\left [\\left [\n\\begin{array}{ll}\na_n&b_n\\\\\nc_n&d_n\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\right ]\\right ]\\in\\PSL(2,\\Bbb{C})$$ be a sequence such that $\\iota(A_n)\\xymatrix{\\ar[r]_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}&}Id$. Then\n\n$$\\left [\\left [\n\\begin{array}{lll}\na^2_n&a_nb_n&b^2_n\\\\\n2a_nc_n& a_nd_n+b_nc_n&2b_nd_n\\\\\nc_n^2&d_nc_n&d^2_n\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\right ] \\right ]\n\\xymatrix{\\ar[r]_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}&}Id.$$ Therefore the $(a^2_n),(d^2_n)$ are bounded and bounded away from $0$, $b_n^2\\xymatrix{\\ar[r]_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}&}0$, and $c_n^2\\xymatrix{\\ar[r]_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}&}0$, which is a contradiction.\n\nLet $g\\in\\PSL(3,\\Bbb{C}) $ be such that $g$ fixes four points in general position. Then $g=Id$.\n\nWe can assume that the four points in general position fixed by $g$ are $\\{e_1,e_2,e_3,p\\}$. Then $$g=\n\\left [\\left [\n\\begin{array}{lll}\na_1&0&0\\\\\n0&a_2&0\\\\\n0&0& a_3\n\\end{array}\n\\right ]\\right ].$$\n\nSince $p,e_1,e_2,e_3$ are in general position, we conclude $p=[b_1,b_2,b_3]$ where $b_1b_2b_3\\neq 0$. On the other hand, since $p$ is fixed we deduce $$[b_1,b_2,b_3]=[a_1b_1,a_2b_2,a_3b_3],$$ therefore there is an $r\\in\\Bbb{C}^*$ such that $b_i=ra_ib_i$. In consequence $a_1=a_2=a_3$, which concludes the proof.\n\nThe Veronese curve has four points in general position.\n\nA straightforward calculation shows that $[1,0,0], [0,0,1],[1,2,1],[1,2i,-1]$ are points on the Veronese curve. In order to conclude the proof, it is enough to observe $$\\left \\vert\n\\begin{array}{lll}\n1&1&1 \\\\\n0&2&2i\\\\\n0&1& -1\n\\end{array}\\right\\vert=-2-2i,\\,\\hbox{and}\\,\\left\\vert\n\\begin{array}{lll}\n0&1&1\\\\\n0&2&2i\\\\\n1&1&-1\n\\end{array}\\right\\vert=-2+2i.$$\n\nThe subgroup of $\\PSL(3,\\Bbb{C})$ leaving $\\psi(\\Bbb{P}_\\Bbb{C}^1)$ invariant is $\\iota(\\PSL(2,\\Bbb{C}))$.\n\nFirst, let us prove that $Ver=\\psi(\\Bbb{P}_\\Bbb{C}^1)$ is invariant under $\\iota(\\PSL(2,\\Bbb{C}))$. Let $A=[[a_{ij}]]\\in \\PSL(2,\\Bbb{C})$. Then $$\\iota\n\\left [\\left [ \n\\begin{array}{ll}\na_{11}&a_{12}\\\\\na_{21}&a_{22}\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\right ]\\right ]\n\\left [\n\\begin{array}{l}\nx\\\\\n2xy\\\\\ny^2\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\right ]=\n\\left [\n\\begin{array}{l}\n(a_{11}x+a_{12}y)^2 \\\\\n2(a_{21}x+a_{22}y)(a_{11}x+a_{12}y)\\\\\n(a_{21}x+a_{22}y)^2\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\right ],$$ and so $Ver$ is invariant under $\\iota \\PSL(2,\\Bbb{C})$ and the following diagram commutes. $$\\label{e:aut}\n\\xymatrix{\n\\Bbb{P}_\\Bbb{C}^1 \\ar[r]^\\gamma \\ar[d]^\\psi         & \\Bbb{P}_\\Bbb{C}^1 \\ar[d]^\\psi \\\\\nVer \\ar[r]^{\\iota \\gamma}  & Ver\n}$$ Now let $\\tau\\in\\PSL(3,\\Bbb{C})$ be an element which leaves $Ver$ invariant. Define $$\\begin{array}{l}\n\\widetilde{\\tau}:\\Bbb{P}_\\Bbb{C}^1\\rightarrow \\Bbb{P}_\\Bbb{C}^1 \\quad.\\\\\n \\widetilde{\\tau}(z)=\\psi^{-1}(\\tau(\\psi(z))).\n\\end{array}$$ Clearly $\\widetilde{\\tau}$ is well defined and biholomorphic, thus $\\widetilde{\\tau}\\in \\PSL(2,\\Bbb{C})$ and the following diagram commutes. $$\\xymatrix{\n\\Bbb{P}_\\Bbb{C}^1 \\ar[r]^{\\widetilde \\tau}\\ar[d]^\\psi         & \\Bbb{P}_\\Bbb{C}^1 \\ar[d]^\\psi \\\\\nVer \\ar[r]^{\\tau}  & Ver\n}$$ From diagram \\[e:aut\\], we conclude that $\\tau\\mid_{Ver}=\\iota\\widetilde\\tau\\mid_{Ver}$.

Thus the sets $$\\begin{array}{l}\n\\{(g,h,gh): g,h\\in Aut(BV)\\}\\\\\n\\{(g,g^{-1}): g\\in Aut(BV)\\}\n\\end{array}$$ are semi-algebraic sets.

Since $Aut(BV)$ is semi-algebraic, we deduce that it is a Lie group with a finite number of connected components (see [@semi]). On the other hand, since $Aut(BV)$ contains a discrete subgroup, we conclude $Aut(BV)$ has positive dimension.\\\nNow let us prove part (\\[l:2\\]). Let $x\\in \\Lambda(\\Gamma)$. Then there is a sequence $(\\gamma_n)\\subset \\Gamma$ of distinct elements such that $\\gamma_n\\xymatrix{\\ar[r]_{m\\rightarrow\\infty}&}x$ uniformly on compact sets of $\\widehat{\\Bbb{C}}\\setminus \\{x\\}$. From Lemma \\[l:pseudo\\] we know that $\\iota\\gamma_n\\xymatrix{\\ar[r]_{m\\rightarrow\\infty}&}\\psi(x)$ uniformly on compact sets of $\\Bbb{P}_\\Bbb{C}^2\\setminus T_{\\psi(x)}Ver$, thus $\\psi x\\in \\partial B$ and $T_{\\psi(x)}Ver$ is tangent to $\\partial(B)$ at $x$. This concludes the proof.\\\nNow let us prove part (\\[l:3\\]). Since $\\Gamma$ preserves the ball $B$, there is a Hermitian matrix $A=(a_{ij})$ with signature $(2,1)$ such that $B=\\{[x]\\in\\Bbb{P}^2_{\\Bbb{C}}:\\overline{x}^t Ax<0\\}$. Without loss of generality, we may assume that $[0,0,1]\\notin C=\\partial(B)\\cap Ver$. Thus for each $x\\in C$, there is a unique $z\\in \\Bbb{C}$ such that $x=[1,2z,z^2]=\\psi [1,z]$ and $(1,2\\bar z,\\bar{z}^2)^tA(1, 2z,z^2)=0$. A straightforward calculation shows that $(1,2\\bar z,\\bar{z}^2)^tA(1, 2z,z^2)=0$ is equivalent to $$\\label{e:cuadrica}\na_{11}+4Re(a_{12}z)+2Re(a_{13}z^2)+a_{33}\\vert z\\vert^4+4\\vert z\\vert^2 Re(a_{23}z)+4\\vert z \\vert^2a_{22}=0.$$ Taking $z=x+iy$ and $a_{ij}=b_{ij}+ic_{ij}$, Equation (\\[e:cuadrica\\]) can be written as $$\\begin{array}{l}\na_{11}+4(b_{12}x-c_{12}y)+2(b_{13}(x^2-y^2)-2c_{13}xy)+a_{33}(x^2+y^2)^2+\\\\\n+4(x^2+y^2)( b_{23}x-c_{23}y)+4(x^2+y^2)a_{22}=0,\n\\end{array}$$ which proves the assertion.\\\nLet us prove part (\\[l:4\\]). Since $\\iota^{-1}Aut(BV)$ is a Lie group with positive dimension containing a non-elementary discrete subgroup, we deduce that (see [@CS1]) $\\iota^{-1}Aut(BV)$ can be conjugated either to $\\PSL(2,\\Bbb{C})$ or a subgroup of $Mob(\\hat{\\Bbb{R}})$. On the other hand, we know that $\\PSL(2,\\Bbb{C})$ acts transitively on the Riemann sphere, but $\\iota^{-1}Aut(BV)$ leaves an algebraic curve invariant, plus a point, therefore $\\iota^{-1}Aut(BV)$ is conjugate to a subgroup of $Mob(\\hat{\\Bbb{R}})$, which concludes the proof.\\\nLet us prove part (\\[l:5\\]). We know that $C$ is $Aut(BV)$-invariant and by part (\\[l:3\\]) of the present lemma $\\psi^{-1}C$ is an algebraic curve. Thus by Montel\u2019s Lemma we conclude that $\\Lambda_{Gr}\\iota^{-1}Aut(BV)\\subset \\psi^{-1}C$, where $\\Lambda_{Gr}\\iota^{-1}Aut(BV)$ is the Greenberg limit set of $\\iota^{-1}Aut(BV)$, see [@CS1]. Finally by part (\\[l:3\\]), we know that $ \\iota^{-1}Aut(BV)$ is conjugate to a subgroup of $Mob(\\hat{\\Bbb{R}})$, therefore $ \\Lambda_{Gr}\\iota^{-1}Aut(BV)$ is a circle in the Riemann sphere and $\\Lambda_{Gr}\\iota^{-1}Aut(BV) = \\psi^{-1}C$.\\\nIn order to prove part (\\[l:6\\]), observe that after a projective change of coordinates we can assume that $\\psi^{-1}C=\\hat{\\Bbb{R}}$. Thus $C=\\psi  \\hat{\\Bbb{R}}=\\{[z^2,2zw,w^2]:z,w\\in \\Bbb{R}, \\vert a\\vert +\\vert b\\vert \\neq 0\\}$. The following claim concludes the proof.\\\nClaim. The sets $C$ and $\\partial \\Bbb{H}^1_{\\Bbb{R}}=\\{[x,y,z]\\in\\Bbb{P}^2_{\\Bbb{R}}:x^2+y^2=z^2\\}$ are projectively equivalent. Let $\\gamma\\in PSL(3,\\Bbb{R})$, be the projective transformation induced by: $$\\widetilde  \\gamma=\n \\begin{pmatrix}\n 1 & 0 & -1\\\\\n 0 & 1 &0\\\\\n 1 & 0 &1\n \\end{pmatrix}.$$ Given $[p]=[x^2,2xy, y^2]\\in C$, we get $\\gamma(p)=(x^2 - y^2, 2 xy, x^2 + y^2)$ and $$(x^2 - y^2)^2+ (2 xy)^2=( x^2 + y^2)^2.$$ Thus $\\gamma C\\subset \\partial \\Bbb{H}^1_{\\Bbb{R}}$. Since $C$ is a compact, connected and contains more than two points we conclude that $\\gamma$ is a projective equivalence between $C$ and $\\partial \\Bbb{H}^1_{\\Bbb{R}}$.\\\nNow we prove part (\\[l:7\\]). Let $x\\in B$. Then $x^{\\bot}$ is a complex line in $\\Bbb{P}_\\Bbb{C}^2\\setminus \\bar{B}$; by B\u00e9zout\u2019s theorem we know $Ver\\cap x^\\bot$ is non-empty, thus $Ver\\cap(\\Bbb{P}^2_\\Bbb{C}\\setminus\\bar{B})\\neq\\emptyset$.\\\nFinally, let us prove part (\\[l:8\\]). After conjugating by an element in $\\iota\\PSL(3,\\Bbb{C})$ we can assume that $[0,0,1]\\notin\\partial B$. Let $A=(a_{ij})$ be the Hermitian matrix introduced in part (\\[l:3\\]) of the present lemma. Clearly $a_{33}\\neq 0$. Now let $F:\\Bbb{R}^2\\rightarrow \\Bbb{R}$ be given by\n\n$$F(x,y)=a_{11}+4(b_{12}x-c_{12}y)+2(b_{13}(x^2-y^2)-2c_{13}xy)+a_{33}(x^2+y^2)^2\n+4(x^2+y^2) ( b_{23}x-c_{23}y+a_{22}).$$\n\nThus by part (\\[l:5\\]) of this lemma we know $\\psi^{-1}C=F^{-1}0$ is a circle. Moreover $$\\begin{array}{l}\n\\iota F^{-1}\\Bbb{R}^+=Ver\\cap\\Bbb{P}_\\Bbb{C}^2\\setminus \\bar{B}.\\\\\n\\iota F^{-1}\\Bbb{R}^-=Ver\\cap B.\\\\\n\\iota F^{-1}0=Ver\\cap\\partial B.\\\\\n\\end{array}$$ If $Ver\\cap B=\\emptyset$, then $F(x,y)\\geq 0$. A straightforward calculation shows $$\\bigtriangleup  F(x,y)=16(a_{33}(x^2+y^2)+a_{22}+2b_{23}x-2c_{23}y).$$ Thus $E=\\{(x,y)\\in \\Bbb{R}^2:\\bigtriangleup  F(x,y)=0\\}$ is an ellipse.\\\nClaim: We have $ \\psi^{-1}C\\cap Int(E)=\\emptyset$. On the contrary let us assume that there is an $x\\in  C\\cap Int(E)\\neq\\emptyset$. Then there is an open neighbourhood $U$ of $x$ contained in $Int(E)$. Thus $\\bigtriangleup  F(x,y) $ is negative on $U$, [*i.e.*]{} $F$ is super-harmonic on $U$. However, $F$ attains its minimum in $U$, which is a contradiction.\\\nFrom the previous claim we conclude $C$ is contained in the closure of $Ext(E)$, therefore $\\bigtriangleup  F(x,y)\\leq 0$ in $Int(\\psi^{-1}C)$. As a consequence, $F$ is subharmonic in $Int(\\psi^{-1}C)$. Let $c$ be the centre of $\\psi^{-1}C$ and $r$ its radius. Let $(r_n)$ be a strictly increasing sequence of positive numbers such that $r_n\\xymatrix{\\ar[r]_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}&}r$. Let $x_n\\in\\overline{B_{r_n}(c)}$ be such that $$F(x_n)=max\\{F(x):x\\in\\overline{B_{r_n}(c)}\\}.$$\n\nSince $F$ is subharmonic in $B_{r_n}(c)$ we conclude $x_n\\in \\partial B_{r_n}(c)$ and $(F(x_{n}))$ is a strictly increasing sequence of positive numbers. Since $Int(\\psi^{-1}C)\\cup \\psi^{-1}C$ is a compact set, we can assume $x_n\\xymatrix{\\ar[r]_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}&}x$, and clearly $x\\in \\psi^{-1}C$. On the other hand, since $F$ is continuous we conclude $F(x_n)\\rightarrow F(x)=0$, which is a contradiction.\n\n\\[l:conpo\\] There is a $\\gamma_0\\in \\PSL(3,\\Bbb{R})$ such that\n\n1.  \\[l:con1\\] $\\gamma_0\\iota \\PSL(2,\\Bbb{R})\\gamma^{-1}_0=\\PO^+(2,1)$, where $\\PO^+(2,1)$ is the principal connected component of $\\PO(2,1)$,\n\n2.  \\[l:con2\\] $\\gamma_0 Ver \\cap \\Bbb{H}^2_\\Bbb{C} $ is non-empty and $\\PO(2,1)^+$-invariant.\n\nLet us prove (\\[l:con1\\]).

Let $x\\in  Ver\\cap B$ and denote by $Aut^+(BV)$ the principal connected component of $Aut(BV)$ which contains the identity.

On the other hand, observe that $$\\begin{array}{l}\n\\iota H_x\\Pi(x)=\\Pi\\iota H_x(x)=\\Pi(x) \\;\\; \\hbox{and}\\\\\n\\iota H_y\\Pi(y)=\\Pi\\iota H_y(y)=\\Pi(y).\n\\end{array}$$ Therefore $$\\iota H_x\\cup\\iota H_y\\subset Isot(\\PO^+(2,1),\\Pi x).$$ Since $\\Pi(x)\\in \\Bbb{H}^2_{\\Bbb{R}}$, we deduce that $Isot (\\PO^+(2,1),\\Pi x)$ is a Lie group where each element is elliptic. Therefore $H=\\iota^{-1}Isot (\\PO^+(2,1),\\Pi x)\\gamma_0$ is a Lie subgroup of $\\PSL(2,\\Bbb{R})$ where each element is elliptic and $H_y\\cup  H_x\\subset H$. From the classification of Lie subgroups of $\\PSL(2,\\Bbb{C})$, we deduce that $H$ is conjugate to a subgroup of $Rot_\\infty$. Hence $H_y=H_x$ and so $x=y$.\n\n\\[t:rf\\] Let $\\Gamma\\subset \\PSL(2,\\Bbb{C})$ be a discrete group. Then $\\Gamma$ is conjugate to a subgroup $\\Sigma$ of $\\PSL(2,\\Bbb{R})$ such that $ \\Bbb{H}/\\Sigma$ is a compact Riemann surface if and only if $\\iota\\Gamma$ is conjugate to a discrete compact surface group of $\\PO^+(2,1)$.\n\nLet $\\Gamma\\subset \\PSL(2,\\Bbb{R})$ be a subgroup acting properly, discontinuously, freely, and with compact quotient on $\\Bbb{H}^+$. Let $R$ be a fundamental region for the action of $\\Gamma$ on $\\Bbb{H}^+$. We may assume without loss of generality that $\\psi(R)\\subset\\Bbb{H}^2_{\\Bbb{C}}$. Thus $\\Pi\\psi\\overline{R} $ is a compact subset of $\\Bbb{H}^2_\\Bbb{R}$ satisfying $\\iota\\Gamma\\Pi\\psi\\overline{R}=\\Bbb{H}^2_{\\Bbb{R}}$ which shows that $\\iota\\Gamma$ is a discrete compact surface group of $\\PO^+(2,1)$.\\\nNow let us assume that $\\iota\\Gamma$ is a discrete compact surface group of $\\PO^+(2,1)$. Then $\\Gamma\\subset\\PSL(2,\\Bbb{R})$. Thus $\\iota\\Gamma\\subset\\PO^+(2,1)$ and $\\Bbb{H}^2_{\\Bbb{R}}/\\iota\\Gamma$ is a compact surface, see [@tengren]. Now, consider the following commutative diagram\n\n$$\\xymatrix{\n  \\Bbb{H}_\\Bbb{R}^2 \\ar[r]^{\\Pi^{-1}} \\ar\n[d]^{q_1}    & Ver\\cap \\Bbb{H}^2_\\Bbb{C} \\ar[d]^{q_2} \\ar[r]^{\\psi^{-1}} & \\Bbb{H}^+\\ar[d]^{q_3}\\\\\n\\Bbb{H}^2_{\\Bbb{R}}/\\iota \n\\Gamma\n\\ar[r]^{\\widetilde {\\Pi}}   & \n(Ver\\cap \\Bbb{H}^2_\\Bbb{C})/ \\iota\\Gamma\\ar[r]^{\\widetilde \\psi} &\n\\Bbb{H}^+/\\Gamma\n}$$\n\nwhere $q_1,q_2,q_3$ are the quotient maps, $\\widetilde {\\Pi}(x)=q_2\\Pi^{-1}q_1^{-1}x$, and $\\widetilde\\psi(x)=q_3\\psi^{-1}q_2^{-1}(x)$. By Lemma \\[l:prv\\], we conclude that $\\Bbb{H}^2_{\\Bbb{R}}/\\iota\\Gamma,(Ver\\cap \\Bbb{H}^2_\\Bbb{C})/\\iota\\Gamma,\\Bbb{H}^+/\\Gamma$ are homeomorphic compact surfaces, which concludes the proof.\n\nProof of theorem \\[t:main2\\] {#proof-of-theorem-tmain2 .unnumbered}\n============================\n\nIf $\\Gamma\\subset\\PO^+(2,1)$ is a discrete compact surface group, then by Lemma \\[l:conpo\\] we can assume that there is a $\\Sigma\\subset\\PSL(2,\\Bbb{R})$ such that $\\iota\\Sigma=\\Gamma$. By Theorem \\[t:rf\\] we know that $\\Bbb{H}/\\Sigma$ is a compact Riemann surface. From the classic theory of quasi-conformal maps, see [@lipa1; @lipa2], it is known that there is a sequence of quasi-conformal maps $(q_n:\\widehat{\\Bbb{C}}\\rightarrow\\widehat{\\Bbb{C}})$ such that $q_n\\xymatrix{\\ar[r]_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}&}Id$ and $\\Sigma_n=q_n\\Sigma q_n^{-1}$ is a quasi-Fuchsian group, which can not be conjugated to a Fuchsian one. In consequence $\\Gamma_n=\\gamma_0\\iota\\Sigma_n\\gamma_0^{-1}$ is complex Kleinian and neither conjugate to a subgroup of $\\PU(2,1)$ nor $\\PSL(3,\\Bbb{R})$, which concludes the proof.\n\nNow the following result is trivial.\n\nThere are complex Kleinian groups acting on $\\Bbb{P}^2_{\\Bbb{C}}$ which are not conjugate to either a complex hyperbolic group or a virtually affine group.\n\nThe authors would like to thank J.
