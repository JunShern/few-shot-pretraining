    "text": "Ghibli Museum Videos: Explore the World of Studio Ghibli from Home\n\nGhibli Museum in Mitaka, Tokyo is one of the most popular tourist sites in Japan, attracting tourists and anime fans across the world.\n\nOne of notable features of Ghibli Museum is the photography restriction, which all visitors are strictly prohibited to take photos and videos inside the museum (you can take photos outside). This is in order to focus on the exhibits and keep the special memory inside the heart. Therefore, Ghibli Museum remains mysterious to those who have never been to the museum.\n\nSadly, Ghibli Museum has been closed due to the prevention of spreading Coronavirus since late February 2020, however, the museum recently launched its official YouTube channel and started sharing exclusive videos of museum diaries. These videos give us an amazing opportunity to enjoy the museum and glance the interior in detail. Yes, you can now take a virtual tour to Ghibli Museum from your home.\n\nCurrently, there are 4 videos uploaded on YouTube by the museum staff as of 11 May. The first video was posted on 14 April, introducing the entrance to the museum and the reception area. As you step into the building, you are greeted by colourful stained glass windows and the fresco painting on the ceiling with some Ghibli characters.\n\nThe second video features the museum\u2019s permanent exhibition \u201cWhere a Film is Born\u201d followed by the third video \u201cNight at the Museum\u201d, sharing the night sight of the museum which visitors usually don\u2019t get to see. The fourth video is \u201cCafe\u201d, introducing the popular Straw Hat Cafe which serves dishes and drinks inspired by Studio Ghibli movies.\n\nThe museum promises that there are more videos to come, so let\u2019s wait and see, and make a further exploration of the museum from home!\n\n\u3010Latest Update\u3011\nFifth and sixth videos were uploaded in mid May, featuring inside the ladies restroom and the main hall of the museum.\n\nThankfully, Studio Ghibli has been sharing with us several contents to enjoy at home since the Coronavirus outbreak started. For example, the popular souvenir at the museum, the Ghibli Museum, Mitaka Cookies are usually sold only at the museum shop, but they are now available to purchase online. (Donguri Republic Sora no Ue Online Shop: https://www.donguri-sora.com/products/detail.php?product_id=8544)\n\nAlso, Studio Ghibli offers free download of wallpapers for video chats. There are currently 20 different Ghibli movie themed background images available to download on the official website. (Studio Ghibli Official Website: http://www.ghibli.jp/info/013251/)\n\nMoreover, a producer and co-founder of Stidio Ghibli, Toshio Suzuki shows how to draw Totoro on a Youtube video. The video was shared by Nagoya City Board of Education as a part of the project to keep children active and smile while staying home during the Coronavirus pandemic. Toshio Suzuki is from Nagoya City and gives local kids some ideas how to spend a good time at home by lecturing how to draw Totoro step by step.\n\nWe have introduced more contents to enjoy at home previously, so please check them out if you are self-quarantine due to the Coronavirus and looking for thing to do at home!"
