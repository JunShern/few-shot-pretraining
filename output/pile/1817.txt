    "text": "Professional esports is expected to see continued revenue growth and investment, driven by a range of factors that have pushed the industry further into the mainstream, according to a new survey conducted by law firm Foley & Lardner LLP and The Esports Observer. But industry participants are also eyeing an array of concerns as they focus on protecting and legitimizing their brands at this critical juncture in the esports industry\u2019s development.\n\nThe 2018 Esports Survey was completed by 124 professionals, primarily from esports and traditional professional sports teams and leagues, as well as technology and media companies.\n\nWhat\u2019s Driving Growth?\n\nRespondents identified several factors that have had a significant impact on the growth of esports over the past year, including increased interest in streaming deals from major tech companies and TV networks (69%), the growing involvement of traditional professional sports teams, leagues and figures (68%) and the broadening of sponsorships beyond brands endemic to gaming (59%).\n\nThe traditional professional sports industry, eyeing ways to diversify revenue streams, is the group respondents most expect to increase their investment in esports over the next year (57%), followed by private equity and venture capital firms (39%) and media groups (38%). Meanwhile, respondents ranked advertising and sponsorships as the area they expect to drive the most revenue growth in esports over the next year, followed by media rights.\n\n\u201cRespondents\u2019 belief that advertising and sponsorships will drive growth is a positive development for esports as these revenue streams benefit participants across the industry, independent of the developers and publishers that largely dominate the broader gaming industry,\u201d said Michael Wall, of counsel and a member of Foley\u2019s Sports Industry Team. \u201cThis growth can be expected to accelerate as traditional sponsors become increasingly comfortable with evolving metrics for evaluating return on sponsorship investment.\u201d\n\nTobias Seck, business analyst at The Esports Observer, added that \u201cthe near-term growth anticipated from sponsorship deals might be explained by their relatively lower degree of complexity and duration compared to media rights deals, which \u2013 especially considering the impact of mobile streaming \u2013 are likely to contribute significantly to the industry\u2019s long-term growth.\u201d\n\nRisks Abound\n\nDespite the significant promise of esports, survey respondents are also cognizant of the risks facing the industry. Match fixing topped the list of threats to the legitimacy and growth of esports, with 78% of respondents calling it a serious or moderate risk. A substantial percentage said the same of the recent repeal of U.S. net neutrality regulations (71%), the lack of safeguards and protections for underage players (60%) and illegal gambling (57%).\n\n\u201cWhen you consider the amount of money in esports gambling, combined with the ability of one player to make or break a team\u2019s prospects for success, match fixing is really the elephant in the room,\u201d said Mary K. Braza, co-chair of Foley\u2019s Sports Industry Team. \u201cLooking ahead, match fixing has the potential to negatively impact the popularity of esports if fans get the impression that cheating is widespread or that results are illegitimate.\u201d\n\nA strong majority (69%) said their organizations are focused on staying up to date on legal issues concerning esports and complying with current laws and regulations. Respondents also identified a number of legal issues that they believe pose a substantial risk to the esports industry, including cybersecurity and malware attacks targeting gamers\u2019 and fans\u2019 data (65%), intellectual property rights and licensing issues (50%), cyberbullying within games (43%) and contracts that do not provide adequate protections for players (43%).\n\n\u201cSurvey respondents are keenly focused on legal compliance. This is not surprising as the commercial growth of esports requires greater sophistication across the landscape of potentially applicable laws,\u201d said Jon Israel, vice chair of Foley\u2019s Sports Industry Team. \u201cAt the same time, the unique aspects of the esports industry makes the panoply of legal considerations novel and complex, particularly in the absence of laws or regulations specific to esports.\u201d\n\nEsports Institutions \u2013 and What Else Might be Ahead\n\nAmid this risk and uncertainty, a substantial percentage of respondents feel there is a need for stronger esports institutions. They expressed the greatest support for players associations that represent the interests of professional esports players (77%), likely to bring greater credibility to esports and to protect players from exploitation. Another 57% agreed with the need for an organized lobbying group to spur development of esports and influence government regulations. Roughly two-thirds of respondents expect that each would be established within three years.\n\nThe creation of an overarching esports governing body was more controversial, with 47% indicating a need for such a body and 34% dissenting. Supporters indicated that such a governing body could boost legitimacy and mainstream appeal, while opponents argued that it would be impractical or even counterproductive, given the disparate and evolving nature of esports.\n\n\u201cThe survey responses indicate some recognition of a need \u2013 and overall desire \u2013 for the esports industry to band together,\u201d said Kevin Schulz, co-chair of Foley\u2019s Sports Industry Team. \u201cThere\u2019s also notable uncertainty about how that would look and acknowledgment of the practical issues with applying a uniform standard in a constantly changing and dynamic industry comprised of different games and developers.\u201d\n\nRespondents also identified other developments that will support the burgeoning esports industry. Over the next year, the overwhelming majority (88%) foresee the construction of more specialized esports facilities and 47% expect virtual reality esports to grow substantially.\n\nFor more information and to download the complete 2018 Esports Survey report, please click here.\n\nGet The Latest Business and Marketing Related Esports Insights Straight Into Your Inbox\n\nFoley & Lardner LLP looks beyond the law to focus on the constantly evolving demands facing our clients and their industries.
