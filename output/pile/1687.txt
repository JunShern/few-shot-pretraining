    "text": "IRAN & RUSSIA: AREN'T RIVALS\n\nAccording to IRNA, Deputy Minister of Petroleum and Managing Director of National Iranian Gas Company (NIGC) Hamid-Reza Araqi said the Islamic Republic of Iran intends to access European market through LNG but in this connection, it has no plan to compete with or replace Russia.\n\nIran is to raise daily gas output to one billion cubic meters, being capable of exporting 30 billion cubic meters of gas a day to Europe. Of course, it plans to raise the exports through LNG.\n\nRussia is now the biggest exporter of gas to the green continent and highest amount of European energy requirements are met through Russia. So, there are wide-scale discussions that Iran gas might replace that of Russia in Europe.\n\nTo this end, Iran has stressed that though intending to win considerable share in European energy market, Iran is not after being a substitute for Russia in gas market of the continent.\n\nMinistry of Petroleum quoted Araqi as saying that based on guidelines of the Supreme Leader of Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei, there should be exports in the Economy of Resilience and we should play our role in the world trade.\n\nAraqi said Iran has now a share of one percent in the world gas trade and it should rise to 10 percent. 'We are not going to replace Russia and we do not have any such goal. Iran has its own market and our neighbors need gas.'\n\nIran will in the long-run have engagement with many countries and it can access European market through LNG, said Araqi, adding that since world's hugest gas reserves are in Iran, the country has high capacity to meet gas requirements of its neighbors and such issues as price and the technical and political problems should be gradually solved.\n\nHe noted that Iran is the only country in the region which is capable of meeting neighbors' gas and on the other hand, they need the gas.\n\nHe stressed t hat gas production in Iran will rise to 1.260 billion cubic meters a day in the next four years from 600 million cubic meters a day now.\n\nIran's extractio of gas from South Pars reserves will be equal with that of Qatar next year and we can turn the gas into value-added, according to the expert.\n\nHe hoped for 60 million to 100 million cubic meters saving in household gas consumption in the winter season and the amount of gas will be turned into value-added.\n\nChronicle:\n\nPENNENERGY - The Trump administration accused Russia on Thursday of a concerted, ongoing operation to hack and spy on the U.S. energy grid and other critical infrastructure, and separately imposed sanctions on Russian officials for alleged high-tech interference in the 2016 American presidential election.\n\nIAEA - IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano commended efforts by Pakistan to increase nuclear safety and security as the country works to triple its nuclear power capacity. Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi commended the IAEA for the support provided to Pakistan in the use of peaceful nuclear applications. Pakistan \u201cwas ready to further strengthen its partnership with the IAEA and contribute towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals worldwide,\u201d the Prime Minister said.\n\nPLATTS - \"The increase in competition induced new practices in the market that resulted in imports returning to normal,\" Petrobras' Jorge Celestino said during a presentation of the company's 2017 financial results.\n\nPLATTS - The objective of this program is to increase its domestic refinery utilization rates to 90% from current levels of 10-20%, Kragha said speaking to Platts in Cape Town on the sidelines of the African Refiner Association conference."
