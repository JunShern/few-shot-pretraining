Appellants remained on the\n\nproperty and on October 1, 2014, appellees served a three-day notice to vacate the\n\npremises. When appellants failed to vacate, appellees filed a forcible entry and detainer\n\naction in the Mount Vernon Municipal Court.            Appellants filed counterclaims for\n\nretaliatory eviction, tortious interference with a business relationship, and fraud.\n\nBecause the amount of damages sought in the counterclaims exceeded the\n\njurisdictional limits of the municipal court, and after the forcible entry and detainer action\n\nwas resolved in the municipal court, the case was transferred to the Knox County\n\nCommon Pleas Court.\n\n       {\u00b64}   Following the transfer, appellees filed a motion to dismiss the complaint\n\npursuant to Civ. R. 12(B)(6). Appellants sought leave to amend the pleadings, which\n\fKnox County, Case No. 15CA6                                                             3\n\n\nthe trial court did not expressly overrule but implicitly overruled by granting appellees'\n\nCiv. R. 12(B)(6) motion to dismiss. The trial court dismissed the counterclaims on the\n\nbasis that retaliatory eviction is not actionable under R.C. 5321.02 for a commercial\n\nlease, appellants had not alleged a set of facts that appellees interfered with a business\n\nrelationship between them and a third party, and appellants failed to plead fraud with\n\nspecificity.\n\n       {\u00b65}     Appellants assign four errors on appeal:\n\n       {\u00b66}     \u201cI.     THE TRIAL COURT ERRED, ABUSED ITS DISCRETION AND\n\nMISCONSTRUED ITS APPLICATION OF OHIO RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE 15(A)\n\nBY IMPLICITLY DENYING APPELLANTS\u2019 MOTION FOR LEAVE TO AMEND\n\nAPPELLANTS\u2019 ANSWER AND COUNTERCLAIMS.\n\n       {\u00b67}     \u201cII.

R. 15(A) provides in pertinent part:\n\n                    A party may amend its pleading once as a matter of\n\n             course within twenty-eight days after serving it or, if the\n\n             pleading is one to which a responsive pleading is required\n\n             within twenty-eight days after service of a responsive\n\n             pleading or twenty-eight days after service of a motion under\n\n             Civ.R. 12(B), (E), or (F), whichever is earlier. In all other\n\n             cases, a party may amend its pleading only with the opposing\n\n             party's written consent or the court's leave. The court shall\n\n             freely give leave when justice so requires. Unless the court\n\n             orders otherwise, any required response to an amended\n\n             pleading must be made within the time remaining to respond\n\n             to the original pleading or within fourteen days after service of\n\n             the amended pleading, whichever is later.\n\n      {\u00b612} While Civ.R. 15(A) favors a liberal policy when the trial court is confronted\n\nwith a motion to amend a pleading, the role of this Court is to determine whether the\n\ntrial court's decision was an abuse of discretion, not whether it was the same decision\n\fKnox County, Case No. 15CA6                                                                5\n\nwe might have made. Wilmington Steel vs. Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company, 60\n\nOhio St.3d 120, 122, 573 N.E.2d 622 (1991). The term \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d connotes\n\nmore than an error or law or judgment; it implies that the court's attitude is\n\nunreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. Id.\n\n       {\u00b613} Appellants sought to amend their counterclaims on February 6, 2015, to\n\n\u201caddress issues raised in Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion to Dismiss and related pleadings.\u201d They\n\nfurther sought to add a cause of action for voluntary bailment and conversion.\n\n       {\u00b614} While appellants\u2019 motion states that the amended counterclaims are\n\nattached to the motion, the proposed amendment is not attached to the original motion\n\nin the file as transmitted to this Court for review. Appellants did append a file-stamped\n\ncopy of the amended counterclaims to their brief. However, appellants did not plead\n\nfraud with specificity in this amended document, and their cause of action for conversion\n\nand bailment was based on facts known to them at the time they filed their original\n\nanswer and counterclaims. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in overruling the\n\nmotion to amend the answer and counterclaims.\n\n       {\u00b615} The first and second assignments of error are overruled.\n\n                                                III.\n\n       {\u00b616} In their third assignment of error, appellants argue the court erred in\n\ndismissing their cause of action for tortious interference with a business relationship.\n\n       {\u00b617} To dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be\n\ngranted under Civ.R. 12(B)(6), it must be shown \u201cbeyond doubt that the plaintiff can\n\nprove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u201d York v.\n\nOhio State Hwy. Patrol, 60 Ohio St.3d 143, 144, 573 N.E.2d 1063 (1991). In applying\n\fKnox County, Case No. 15CA6                                                              6\n\n\nthis standard, all factual allegations in the complaint are taken as true and all\n\nreasonable inferences are made in favor of the nonmoving party. Appellate review of a\n\nCiv. R. 12(B)(6) dismissal is de novo. Hunt v. Marksman Prod. Div. of S/R Industries,\n\nInc., 101 Ohio App.3d 760, 656 N.E.2d 726 (1995).\n\n      {\u00b618} Civ. R. 12(B)(6) further sets forth what the trial court may consider in ruling\n\non a motion to dismiss:\n\n                    When a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim\n\n             upon which relief can be granted presents matters outside\n\n             the pleading and such matters are not excluded by the court,\n\n             the motion shall be treated as a motion for summary\n\n             judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 56. Provided\n\n             however, that the court shall consider only such matters\n\n             outside the pleadings as are specifically enumerated in Rule\n\n             56. All parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to\n\n             present all materials made pertinent to such a motion by\n\n             Rule 56.\n\n      {\u00b619} The elements of tortious interference with a business relationship are: (1)\n\nthe existence of a prospective business relationship; (2) the wrongdoer's knowledge\n\nthereof; (3) an intentional interference causing a breach or termination of the\n\nrelationship; and (4) damages resulting therefrom. Gen. Medicine, P.C. v. Morning View\n\nCare Ctr ., 5th Dist. Tuscarawas No. 2003AP12\u20130088, 2004\u2013Ohio\u20134669, \u00b6 48..\n\n      {\u00b620} Appellants\u2019 counterclaim alleged that appellees intentionally disrupted the\n\nrelationship between MSD and Unit 16, Inc. by entering into a \u201csecond lease\u201d with Unit\n\fKnox County, Case No. 15CA6                                                              7\n\n\n16, Inc. for the purpose of conducting the business known as Banana Joe\u2019s. The claim\n\nfurther alleged that appellees interfered with the business relationship between MSD\n\nand Unit 16 by locking MSD out of possession of the premises. The counterclaim\n\nalleged that appellees knowingly leased the premises to MSD for the specific purpose of\n\nMSD subleasing to Unit 16, for the operation of the business known as Banana Joe\u2019s.\n\nAppellants alleged that they had been damaged by appellees\u2019 actions.                These\n\nallegations, when taken as true and construing all inferences in favor of appellants, set\n\nforth a claim for tortious interference with a business relationship.\n\n       {\u00b621} In the trial court and before this Court, appellees rely on the findings of\n\nfact of the Mount Vernon Municipal Court and the evidence presented in that case to\n\nsupport their argument that appellants cannot demonstrate entitlement to relief for\n\ntortious interference with a business relationship. However, appellees\u2019 argument relies\n\non evidence outside the pleadings. In the instant case, the trial court did not convert the\n\nmotion to a motion for summary judgment and dispose of it in accordance with Civ. R.\n\n56, and thus could not consider matters outside of the pleadings. Appellees\u2019 argument\n\nis in the nature of a claim that the issues raised by appellants are res judicata; however,\n\nres judicata cannot be raised in a Civ. R. 12(B)(6) motion. See Wellman v. Wheeling &\n\nLake Erie Railway Co., 5th Dist. Stark No. 999CA00161, 2000 WL 93986 (December\n\n29, 1999). The court erred in granting appellees\u2019 Civ. R. 12(B)(6) motion as to the claim\n\nfor tortious interference with a business relationship.\n\n       {\u00b622} Appellants\u2019 third assignment of error is sustained.\n\fKnox County, Case No. 15CA6                                                                    8\n\n\n                                                  IV.\n\n       {\u00b623} In their fourth assignment of error, appellants argue that the court erred in\n\ndismissing their claim for fraud for lack of specificity.\n\n       {\u00b624} To prove fraud, a plaintiff must establish the following elements: (1) a\n\nrepresentation, or silence where there is a duty to disclose, (2) which is material to the\n\ntransaction, (3) made falsely, with knowledge of its falsity, or with such utter disregard\n\nas to its truth that knowledge may be inferred, (4) with the intent to mislead another into\n\nrelying on it, (5) justifiable reliance on the representation, and (6) resulting injury\n\nproximately caused by the reliance. E.g., Williams v. Aetna Financial Co., 83 Ohio St.3d\n\n464, 475, 700 N.E.2d 859 (1998).\n\n       {\u00b625} In addition, a plaintiff alleging fraud must plead with particularity the\n\ncircumstances constituting fraud. Civ. R. 9(B). The circumstances constituting fraud\n\ninclude the time, place, and content of the false representation; the fact misrepresented;\n\nthe identification of the individual giving the false representation; and the nature of what\n\nwas obtained or given as a consequence of the fraud. Aluminum Line Products Co. v.\n\nSmith Roofing Co., Inc, 109 Ohio App.3d 246, 259, 671 N.E.2d 1343 (1996).\n\n       {\u00b626} Appellants\u2019 claim for fraud does not set forth the facts constituting their\n\nfraud claim.     They did not set forth the time, place, or content of the false\n\nrepresentation, and generally allege that they were misled by appellees at the time they\n\nentered the lease. The claim does not set forth the fact misrepresented or the nature of\n\nwhat was obtained or given as a consequence of the fraud. The court did not err in\n\ndismissing the fraud claim for failure to plead with specificity as require by Civ. R. 9(B).\n\n       {\u00b627} The fourth assignment of error is overruled.\n\fKnox County, Case No. 15CA6                                                            9\n\n\n       {\u00b628} The judgment of the Knox County Common Pleas Court dismissing\n\nappellant\u2019s claim for tortious interference with a business relationship is reversed. The\n\njudgment is affirmed in all other respects. This cause is remanded to that court for\n\nfurther proceedings according to law. Costs are to be divided equally between the\n\nparties.\n\nBy: Baldwin, J.\n\nGwin, P.J. and\n\nDelaney, J. concur.\n\f"
