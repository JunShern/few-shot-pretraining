    "text": "Hi Drew, what are your regulations about a specific member who is getting a reputation for ripping off other members by non-payment on purchases? I don't want to start mudslinging any names but it seems to be something this one member in particular is doing out here in BC. I am aware it is buyer beware but if it is the same person over and over to other members of the forum?? Let me know when you can, thanks: Darryl\n\nHello Drew,\nI'm new here and I wanted to introduce myself, but it's impossible for me to post, it does not work. What should I do?\nExcuse me for my English, I use Google translator.\nKindest regards\nSerge\n\nThe new CAC site had a free \"forum listings\" section that I thought you might like to know about. Two photos and a video can be included with the listing. The CAC gets decent traffic and may generate some traffic for you. (I'm not an owner or anything, just a member.)"
