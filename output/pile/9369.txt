I wasn't sure if it would be suitable for handle material so I dried some and sent it in to be stabilized. The first batch was small just to see what would happen. The wood takes really to stabilizing with a significant weight gain. Plus no visible pores so it should polish up real good. To me it is a lot like quilted maple but cleaner coloring.\n\nI will put some in the store later today if things go as planned.\n\nI hope you know who knows that this was just intended as good natured teasing.\nIf I offended you, My Apologies.\n\nsachem allison\n\n10-27-2012, 02:03 PM\n\nmakes an excellent laxative\n\nCutty Sharp\n\n10-27-2012, 02:13 PM\n\nClever post!\n\nI have no idea who this 'you know who' is, but that's nice wood and might also look great in a wa-handle.

Got my piece and we've been playing with it--turn it one way, and it looks like there are grooves cut in the wood. The other way makes it look like there are ridges. Incredibly 3D."
