    "text": "Tax Reform Update\n\nThe Tax Reform Act of 2017 made meaningful change to the Federal tax code that has helped stimulate our country\u2019s economy. It also created some confusion and unknowns. But your Home Builders Association and other associations have been working hard with the IRS to get you some answers and create the best outcome for your businesses.\n\nIRS to Waive 2018 Withholding Penalties for Most Filers\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service has announced that it is waiving the tax penalty for many home builders and other small businesses that pay estimated quarterly taxes but whose 2018 federal income tax withholding and/or estimated tax payments fell short of their total tax liability for the year.\n\nTreasury Issues Final Rule on Pass Through Entities\nThe Treasury Department has issued final regulations for the 20% pass through entity deduction under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The final regulations concern the deduction for qualified business income under Section 199A of the Internal Revenue Code. This includes individuals, partnerships, S corporations, trusts, and estates engaged in domestic trades or businesses.\n\n(the following content sourced from the National Association of REALTORS)IRS Provides Clear Test on How 20% Deduction Applies to Rental Income, Exchanges\n\nThe IRS has issued final rules on the 20 percent business income deduction that was part of the 2017 Tax Reform Act. The new rule confirms that the deduction applies to your business income, as a real estate agent or broker, if you operate as a sole proprietor or owner of a partnership, S corporation, or limited liability company. It applies even if your income exceeds a threshold set in the law of $157,500 for single filers and $315,000 for joint filers. In addition, the new rule provides guidance on two other provisions: 1) whether any real estate rental income is eligible for the deduction, and 2) how the deduction applies to properties exchanged under Section 1031.\n\nEligibility of rental income\n\nRental property income also can qualify for the new deduction, as long as you can show that your rental operation is part of a trade or business. The IRS has released proposed guidelines that include a bright-line test for showing that rental income rises to the level of a trade or business. Under that safe harbor, you can claim the deduction if your rental activities-which include maintaining and repairing property, collecting rent, paying expenses, and conducting other typical landlord activities-total at least 250 hours a year. If your activity totals less than that, you can still try to take the deduction, but you will have to be prepared to show the IRS that your activity is part of a trade or business.\n\nEligibility of 1031 like-kind exchanges\n\nUnder earlier proposed regulations, if your income was above threshold levels set in the tax law\u2013$157,500 for single filers, $315,000, for joint filers\u2013and you had exchanged one property for another to defer taxes under Sec. 1031, the amount of the new deduction might be reduced because of the swap. NAR and other trade groups reached out to the IRS to change this treatment, and the IRS has made the change. Under the final rules, you can use the unadjusted basis of the depreciable portion of the property to claim at least a partial deduction."
