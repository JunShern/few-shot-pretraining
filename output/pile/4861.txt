Another thing worth noting is that I'm the only one pushing/commiting/accessing this repository. \nSSHing into my repository server trying to chown, chmod, copy, rename etc the repository, I keep getting the error Read-only file system.  Listing the owner of the repository by using ls -ld my-repo.git yields:\n\ndrwxrwsr-x 7 my_user users 248 Jul 20 14:56 my-repo.git/\n\nLooks proper, owned by me, right? I don't understand why this is happening. Any suggestions on how to solve this extremely annoying problem would be highly appreciated!\n\nA:\n\nyour disk broke and the OS remounted it as readonly to save it. see /var/log/messages and the output of \"mount\" to confirm. \n\n"
