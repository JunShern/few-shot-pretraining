    "text": "Complementary and Alternative Medicine\n\nThe terms \"complementary\" and \"alternative\" are sometimes used to refer to non-traditional methods of diagnosing, preventing, or treating cancer or its symptoms. Here you'll find general information to help you better understand what these terms mean and how to decide if using them is right for you. You'll also find a wealth of information on specific complementary and alternative treatments, grouped into the five categories below.\n\nYou may hear about alternative or complementary methods to prevent, diagnose, or treat cancer or its symptoms. Learn about what these terms mean and find information to help you think through the issues to make the most informed and safest decision possible.\n\nDietary supplements include things like vitamins, minerals, herbs, or products made from plants, animal parts, algae, seafood, or yeasts. The information here can help you learn more about dietary supplements so you can make a more informed decision about using them safely.\n\nYou may have just heard about a new or alternative form of cancer treatment. Before you put your time, your body, and your money on the line, learn more about what you are looking at so you can decide if it's worth it.\n\nIn your quest to be healthy, you may hear about something that you are told can reduce your risk of cancer -- a new way you haven't heard about before. It sounds like a good idea, and you may want to try it. Before you put your body and money on the line, find out more about it.\n\nEven though placebos are not active medicines, they seem to help some patients. The effects of placebos may occur because the patient believes in the substance, the treatment, or the doctor. Even if a person feels better after taking a placebo, it doesn't mean the person's illness or symptoms were not real.\n\nMore Information on Complementary and Alternative Medicine\n\nFor reliable information on specific complementary and alternative methods, please see the following websites:\n\nSelect A Hope Lodge\n\nPlease share your thoughts about your cancer.org website experience.
