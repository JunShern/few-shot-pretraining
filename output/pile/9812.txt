    "text": "Introductions\n\n\"Run-of-the-mill\" seems like a modestly accurate way to describe myself in terms of horror fandom. In certain respects I find that valuable, since ideally I can make an appeal to those like myself, to those who may be testing the waters, and hopefully to the hardcore horror fans as well. (And I sincerely encourage feedback, especially from the latter.) It wasn't until several years ago, the present time of this writing being December of '09 to give perspective, that the genre genuinely appealed to me and I owe all that to the film adaptation of Stephen King's 'IT'. After that, it was a slow and steady progression that grew into watching more Stephen King film adaptations, then into watching general horror films. In more recent years it's branched from solely films into different mediums, namely: comics (comic books, manga, graphic novels, webcomics, etc.), purely written literature, and different games.\n\nBut let's get to the point, shall we? The Darkley Niche is something I've constructed after the comic-in-progress that a friend and myself plan on self-publishing, an anthology of short horror stories much in the same vein as 'Tales from the Crypt' and similar titles. The series centers around a faceless persona we've affectionately dubbed Alan Darkley, the Niche's namesake, and a cast of storytellers whose tales fall within particular subgenres and sister genres of horror. This site is the drawing board, if you will, where everything posted is either a form of research or a roughing out of ideas. It's all relevant in some fashion. By exploring these different horror stories and their mediums a better understanding and influence of the genre, as well as inspiration, can be put into the comic. Even if you have no personal interest in the project, perhaps you can glean something from the reviews and the like. And if nothing else, the Niche will work to serve my own purposes.\n\nBe sure to browse over the column of banners below if you're looking for posts on a particular topic.

The Niche is my personal site, while the comic-in-progress is a partnered effort with Don, a lifelong friend of mine. We collaborate on the stories, but my partner's the writer in the outfit while I am the illustrator.

(Or Mystery Hack, rather, as the letter S has fallen off of its proper place on the sign.) But, as the children soon learn, the town of Gravity Falls, Oregon is far from normal and appears to be a hub of all manner of strangeness. It's loosely like 'Twin Peaks', but less soap opera melodrama and for kids. (This is especially apparent at a restaurant called The Club, where the interior resembles the \"Red Room.\")\n\nIn time for the season, 'Gravity Falls' released its latest episode \"Summerween,\" named after the fictitious holiday celebrated on June 22nd. The townsfolk of Gravity Falls apparently all loved Halloween so much that they invented it. (Definitely sounds better than Christmas in July in our book.) Essentially, Summerween keeps to the same traditions as Halloween does but with just a few discrepancies: watermelons are used instead of pumpkins to create jack o' melons, \"cheap ol' loser\" candy is prevalent (ex: Sand Pop!, Gummy Chairs, and Mr. Adequate-Bar), and, in direct relation to the candy, the Summerween Trickster. As Mystery Shack handyman Soos tells it to the Pines kids, the\nSummerween Trickster is a boogeyman who will get children discontent\nwith the off-brand candy or lacking in the Summerween spirit.\n\nbowl of cheap ol' loser candy\n\nThe legend of the Summerween Trickster has to be invoked, of course, so naturally a scenario shortly afterward begins to set itself up. Wendy, another Mystery Shack employee, along with a Donnie Darko-esque Robbie, the typical douche-bag boyfriend, come by the Shack to pick up her coat that evening. While there, she relates to Dipper details of a party happening later that night and that he ought to come. As it happens, Wendy is one of those slightly older cool kids and incidentally Dipper's crush. So when she inadvertently validates Robbie's point that trick-or-treating is for little kids, he decides to give it up.\n\n\"Twins in costumes! The people eat it up.\"\n\nThis proves problematic, as Mabel loves trick-or-treating and has fond memories of doing this together. To spare his sister's feelings, Dipper feigns sickness from eating some of the bad candy. But while in the middle of selling his white lie, there comes a visitor knocking at the Shack's door. Cue the ominous music, and here we are introduced to a trick-or-treating Summerween Trickster. However, exasperated with convincing his sister that he simply isn't up to it, Dipper rudely shuts the door on their visitor twice.\n\nYeahhh, you already know that this isn't going to go over well.\n\n\"Trick or treeeat...\"\n\n\"Dude, really? You're a little old for this, man.\"\n\nA third, more adamant knock bangs on their front door and this time Mabel answers, as Dipper refuses to. She politely excuses her brother's behavior, but the Summerween Trickster has been angered and will not be appeased until they have met his demand: retrieve five-hundred pieces of candy that night before the last jack o' melon goes out, or else he will be eaten (just like an unfortunate, random kid is only moments before). Now, even if this wasn't some sort of boogeyman, he's still an incredibly tall and creepily imposing guy. That alone should be adequate motivation. Even so, Dipper begrudgingly goes along with trick-or-treating as Mabel recruits Soos and her friends to help.\n\n\"I got a picture!\"\n\nMeanwhile, Stan Pines, the self-proclaimed \"Master of Fright,\" gleefully anticipates terrifying any trick-or-treaters who come over to the Mystery Shack. Between an 'Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark' melting face scare and a disembowelment with sausage link guts, this works pretty well for the most part. However, two among the group of costumed kids are underwhelmed with the antics, despite his best efforts. So here we come to a standstill between an unstoppable force and an immovable object: a cheapskate who scares children to avoid handing out treats vs. horror-desensitized kids who want their candy. Who will break first? That question will have to wait.\n\nElsewhere on the streets of Gravity Falls, the Pines twins and their gang of friends begin hitting up the houses. But it becomes plainly clear that people won't hand out enough candy unless Dipper dresses up in costume, which at this point he hasn't. And to give them a healthy little reminder, the Summerween Trickster promptly drops in \u2013 quite literally \u2013 to check on their progress, or rather lack thereof.\n\n\"Tick tock, children...\"\n\n*blows out jack o' melon's candle*\n\nDipper relents and dresses in a complimentary costume to his sister's, the literal peanut butter to her jelly. This goes off without a hitch \u2013 especially with the twin cuteness factor \u2013 and during the ensuing montage of trick-or-treating the circle of friends collect four-hundred and ninety-nine pieces of candy, just in the homestretch. But when Wendy and Robbie happen to spy Dipper he ditches both the costume and candy, making up an excuse as to why he's out. When the older kids have driven off, we see that Mabel has overheard everything and is hurt that Dipper would have otherwise ditched her.To make matters worse, the wheel barrel of their collected candy accidentally dumped itself into a ditch and washed the treats away in a creek. It's then that they notice all of the jack o' melons have gone out, save for one, and despite rescuing it they themselves wind up blowing it out with in sigh of relief. Oops. Cue the ominous music again, and the Summerween Trickster comes to collect.\n\n\"Knock, knock...\"\n\nYeah, even as a kid's television show, that scene is still kinda creepy. Approaching the children on the deserted street, the Summerween Trickster corners them into a local dump. When Dipper is unable to deliver on his demands, the Trickster stretches taller, his humped back tearing through his coat, and another pair of spindly arms branch out. The Pines boy futilely flings the last and only remaining piece of candy at the changing character, only to see it absorb into the boogeyman's mottled skin. Laughing, it pursues the children and begins to nab them in its clutches. Luckily, Soos comes to the rescue in a truck and dashes the Summerween Trickster into broken bits.Their luck doesn't last, though, as the Trickster begins reassembling itself into something more akin to a giant spider, with the exception of the smiley face mask. It leaps onto the moving truck, causing Soos to crash his vehicle into the local Summerween Superstore. Everyone is alright, but the immediate danger isn't over as the monster makes its way into the store and stalks about as they hide.\n\nBlocking the entrance, they devise an escape plan by dressing in the surrounding costumes to disguise themselves from the Trickster as store props. Progress is carefully made and eventually they do make it to the front of the Summerween Superstore. Soos, however, cannot resist the temptation of the touch-activated, talking skull candy bowls. Despite Dipper and Mabel's hushed pleas he goes ahead... And it doesn't work. As it turns out, there are no batteries inside. But in a stroke of comical genius, Soos goes out of his way to tear open a package of batteries, install them, and press again, which of course works this time and alerts the monster.\n\nPerhaps emboldened by the dire situation of their friend Soos, the children brandish costume weapons and attack the monstrous Summerween Trickster. Flecks of the boogeyman-thing glance off of its mottled skin, some in their mouths, and they notice it has a flavor like saltwater taffy. When it sees that they haven't pieced together the truth, the monster removes its mask and reveals that it is, itself, made entirely of \"loser\" candy. \"Did you ever stop and think about the candy at the bottom of the bag, that no one likes?\" it asks. Every year, all of the rejected candy would be discarded in the dump, where it accumulated, grew sentient, and now seeks revenge on the picky children of Gravity Falls.\n\n\"Look at my face. Look closely...\"\n\nNo one would eat him, he tells the children, \"So now, I'm going to eat you...\" But as the monstrous Summerween Trickster draws them closer within its clutches, it hesitates, gurgling out a cry of agony as its chest begins to painfully break outward. Then, Soos suddenly bursts through in a manner directly taken from Ridley Scott's 'Alien' films, even letting out a shrill, Xenomorph-esque squeal and flailing his arms before reverting to passively chewing. He offers some of the creature's candy innards, which catch the ear of the dying Summerween Trickster. Hearing that someone thinks it tastes good \u2013 all it ever really wanted \u2013 makes it happy, so resigns itself and passes.Shortly thereafter, the little kid who was eaten earlier on also bursts out of the Summerween Trickster's body.\n\n\"'Sup, Gorny?\"\n\n\"I've been twamatized!\"\n\nBack at the Mystery Shack, Stan Pines does finally prove himself to be the Master of Fright. When the two stubborn trick-or-treaters have tired of T.P.ing the place, they resolve to go inside and find out the old sheister. Little do they realize, though, that he's readying himself for a bath and walk in on him half naked. Fittingly enough, 'Psycho'-like music strikes up at the sight as they flee screaming into the night. Not only does he get his confidence back, he also lays claim to the bags of candy left behind. All in all, a good Summerween for Stan.Mabel, Dipper, and friends also return to the Mystery Shack, finding Gruncle Stan in his customary chair near the television, watching a late night, horror movie marathon special. Also there, to Dipper's surprise, is Wendy, who relates that the party wasn't so fun after all. Plus, Robbie had to go home early due to choking on the wrong end of a lollipop. (Yup, that boyfriend's a keeper alright.) Dipper is pleased to hear this, but Mabel can't help being disappointed that they have no candy, considering after all the hardship endured that night. Stan pulls out the two claimed bags of candy and generously hands them over to his grandnephew and niece.And so, the rest of Summerween night is spent gathered around the television, eating candy and watching schlocky horror movies. Not a bad way to end the night. Not bad at all.\n\nahh, holiday quality time with friends and family\n\nWe've been thoroughly enjoying Disney's 'Gravity Falls' and \"Summerween\" only reaffirms our faith in both its endearing animation and creative storytelling. Not to mention how this episode playfully nodded to a number of very adult horror movies in a kid-friendly way. When they're older, someday, they can appreciate that on another level as we can now. For parents who are hardcore horror fans, this is a good way to introduce their children to the genre without scaring the bejeezus out of them.This episode scores five out of five jack o' melons.\n\nSaturday, October 6, 2012\n\nWerewolves are a common staple in horror stories and choice in Halloween costumes, and for good reason: they're a classic. Between the mythology and romanticism, they've been engrained in Western culture well since the Middle Ages. And when a storyteller can put their own original spin on the tale that catches our interest, as we're sure it does with yours. So with that in mind we're sharing this music video, \"Du Riechst So Gut\" by industrial, Berlin metal band Rammstein. Even if you aren't versed in the German language, or necessarily a fan of the musical genre, horror fans can at least appreciate the narrative that is visually told, if nothing else. And given that there is a masquerade party held in this music video, it seemed rather appropriate in light of the season when costumes are customary.\n\nSunday, August 19, 2012\n\nAlright, so as our more avid followers can see, we haven't exactly been keeping the Darkley Niche as up-to-date as desired. So with that in mind, we've decided to start a Twitter account for more current, albeit shorter, posts. Follow along and hopefully you'll enjoy these snippets of our thoughts and comments on all things horror!\n\nWednesday, May 30, 2012\n\nKids might not eat their greens for a different reason all together,\nsince they won't want dessert after seeing these. Sculptor Scott Hove is a\nself-taught artist hailing from San Francisco, California, and has\ncreated these creepy confectionery creatures. Below are but a few\ndelectable, albeit deadly, morsels for your viewing pleasure. And while you can't actually eat the artwork (as these are made from polyurethane foam and acrylic gel), it certainly looks like it could eat you. Talk about a set of sweet teeth.\n\nSunday, May 20, 2012\n\nPrepping myself for this year's Detroit FanFare, which is coming up in late October. Given the season\nthat the convention falls in, Marceline the Vampire Queen from 'Adventure Time' felt\nappropriate. She was a little tricker, though, since I didn't have just\nthe right colors for her skin nor mouth, so those were done in\nwatercolor rather than marker. But the final effect was certainly worth\nthe effort.\n\nPurchase this original art for $25 USD, which comes\nin a plastic protector and includes no additional mailing costs. Contact\nme if interested.\n\nMade this sketch card specifically for Detroit Fanfare last year,\nwhich included Bruce Campbell himself as a special guest. Sadly, he\ncancelled his Sunday appearance, which is when I had the card finished\nand ticket purchased to see him. *sigh* Oh, well. Maybe our paths will cross down the road and then I'll get his autograph on this.\n\nThis\nparticular sketch card is not for sale, at least not for the\nconventional $25 USD. I'll be keeping this unless someone really makes\nit worth my while. If interested, make me an offer.\n\nSunday, May 13, 2012\n\nHave a happy Mother's Day, from all of us here at the Darkley Niche!\nFeeling inclined to watch some Mother's Day horror for the occasion?\nWell, look no further than our Seasonal Horror Calendar. Be sure to also browse down the calendar to September as well, for\nthose of you who have grandmothers (Grandparents Day) and stepmothers\n(Stepfamily Day). After all, it's Mother's Day for them too, you know.\n\nHere are a handful of horror film mothers that will make you all the more grateful for your own.\n\nSaturday, May 12, 2012\n\nOuch. *cringes* It's been just shy of a year since our last post, here on the Darkley Niche. Been kept busy dredging away at work like a blue collar zombie. Apologies all around, readers. Without further ado let's get the reagent, because we're about to bring this blog back to life!\n\nAlthough we've been absent for a considerable length of time from the blog scene, we've been keeping at it with watching and reading horror in both film and literature, respectively. And of course there's still oh so plenty on our to-do list. Here's an abridged rundown of what we've viewed in the more recent months during our hiatus. \u2013 We'll try to come back to these later on and write more in-depth reviews or commentaries. Consider this the first entree, so dig in.\n\n__________________________________________\n\nMOVIES\n\n'The Cabin in the Woods' (2012)\n\nWhen you think you've seen all that horror has to offer, 'The Cabin in the Woods' takes many of the tried and tired subgenres and then turns them on their ear, like your ol' Nanna did when she caught you swearing. I had some inkling of what the premise was, but had only guessed at the tip of the iceberg. This is one film that we can confidently feel safe to say you won't be able to predict. Also, kudos to the filmmaker's nods to 'The Evil Dead' movies and guest cameo, albeit brief, with Sigourney Weaver. This was a fun ride, and it was apparently so for those making it.\n\n'Creature from the Black Lagoon' (1954)\n\nWe've been meaning to see this Universal Studios classic for some time, but it wasn't until reading Gary Myers' \"Understudy\" in the 'Shadows Over Innsmouth' anthology that gave us just the right push. The creature itself, that is, the Gill-man, was an impressive costume, both in its appearance and functionality underwater. Not too many made during the fifties can make that claim. And we've been on a serious H.P. Lovecraft kick with all things Innsmouth, so this really hit the sweet spot. In certain respects, we would even favor this film over 'Dagon' (2001).\n\n'Mary Shelley's Frankenstein' (1994)\n\nSpeaking of creatures, here is another movie that features one of its own. This little gem took us by surprise, as we had heard very little about it. And while the names Kenneth Branagh ('Hamlet') and Robert De Niro ('Taxi Driver') don't instantly bring \"horror\" to mind, it was all pulled off rather well. And there was a rather impressive line-up of actors, ranging from Tom Hulce ('Amadeus') to Ian Holm ('From Hell'). Our only real complaint is that Helena Bonham Carter's ('Sweeney Todd' and 'The Corpse Bride') physical appearance as the Bride was rather disappointing.\n\n'The Thing' (2011)\n\nHaving been fans of John Carpenter's 'The Thing', we awaited this prequel with an equal measure of anticipation and trepidation. Admittedly, animatronics and movie make-up will almost always trump CGI in our book. But it wasn't too cumbersome with the latter, which was a relief. And speaking personally, I had to smile when seeing the inclusion of the alien spaceship deep in the Antarctic ice. That hails back to 'The Thing from Another World' (1952) and actually included a number of other bits that I recognized, which were also carried over. It adapted much of what made its two predecessors good movies.\n\n'The Woman in Black' (2012)\n\nWhen we come back to this film, we'll have to make an attempt at watching the 1989 adaptation, albeit both are based on Susan Hill's novel, much in the same way that both 'The Thing's and likewise 'The Thing from Another World' are with John W. Campbell's novella, \"Who Goes There?\" Surprisingly, it wasn't hard to watch Daniel Radcliffe without thinking Harry Potter. (If anything, Elijah Woods kept coming to mind.) While his performance was certainly noteworthy, hands down the best part of the film had to be the Eel Marsh House itself. If you've seen it yourself, you'll understand why.\n\n__________________________________________\n\nTELEVISION\n\nAMC's 'The Walking Dead' (2010-present)\n\n'The Walking Dead' has been a mixed bag for most, and while friends of ours have found plenty at fault with it, we still enjoy the series. Could certain changes have been made for the better? Sure. But as far as comic book adaptations goes, this sure beats the hell out of a lot of them. (Seriously. Look at 'Spider-Man's Green Goblin and ask how they go from the illustrated designs to a sorry, Power Ranger knock-off. With a little make up, Willem Dafoe's face would've been fine.) We're still working our way through season two, so it's always possible our opinion might change. We'll see.\n\nJohn Carpenter's \"Cigarette Burns\" (2005)\n\nEighth episode of 'Masters of Horror's second season, \"Cigarette Burns\" made us think of Robert W. Chambers' 'The King in Yellow' stories, in certain respects. Instead of a play, however, we have a rare film that drives its audience mad. It could also be said that \"Cigarette Burns\" resembles Carpenter's 'In The Mouth of Madness' (1995), which we loved due to its obvious Lovecraft overtones. Lastly, while Udo Kier makes an appearance his screen time is regrettably kept short. (Coincidentally, this episode happens to star Norman Reedus, who plays a regular on AMC's 'The Walking Dead'.)\n\n'Psych'(2006-present)\n\nSeason six of USA's 'Psych' has included some comical homages to horror films, specifically episodes \"This Episode Sucks\" and \"Hereeeee's Lassie\". If James Roday and Dule Hill in full costume as 'Interview with the Vampire's Lestat and Blacula isn't enough for fang fans, it also guest stars Corey Feldman ('The Lost Boys'). And while \"Hereeeee's Lassie\" is essentially a parody of Stanley Kubrick's 'The Shining', there are additional little Easter eggs slipped into the episode, like pregnant neighbor Rosemary ('Rosemary's Baby').\n\nStephen King's 'Bag of Bones' (2011)\n\nUgh... Firstly, we're definite fans of Stephen King stories, so make no mistake. 'IT' (1990) the mini-series still ranks among our top horror favorites. But 'Bag of Bones' was nothing if not predictable, as much as we wanted to like it. (SPOILER ALERT) It didn't take much foresight to predict Pierce Brosnan's character was related to the cursed men, for starters. And let's be honest folks, having an author protagonist is a tiresome trend that occurs pretty regularly in King's work. Yes, it was integral to the plot, but come on. Enough with the writer characters, King.\n\n'Adventure Time' (2010-present)\n\nCartoon Network's series 'Adventure Time' started with an outbreak of candy people zombies, so it was fun to see this idea brought back to life in 3x07a, \"From Bad to Worse.\" Together with the murder mystery in 3x06b, \"The Creeps,\" these two episodes comprised part of Cartoon Network's 2011 Halloween specials. \u2013 Speaking for myself, I particularly enjoyed these episodes as they're the closest I can get to watching horror films with my girlfriend.\n\n__________________________________________\n\nREADING\n\n'Shadows Over Innsmouth'\n\nPublished by Del Rey Books and editted by Stephen Jones, this anthology includes seventeen stories all inspired by H.P. Lovecraft's \"The Shadow Over Innsmouth,\" along with that as well. Some are hits, others are misses. But that's to be expected, really, and the hits really make this book worthwhile. \"The Big Fish,\" \"Daoine Domhain,\" and \"The Innsmouth Heritage,\" were among my personal favorites. Be assured that a detailed Darkley Niche review will be in the works.\n\n'Tales Out of Innsmouth'\n\nAs mentioned earlier in our two cents on 'Creature from the Black Lagoon', we've been indulging in Innsmouth-inspired stories. And while we haven't yet finished this anthology, shorts such as Gary Myers' \"Understudy\" have already made this read a worthwhile venture. Additionally, \"The Weird Shadow over Innsmouth,\" which begins the book, was made from fragments of early drafts and reworked into a cohesive narrative by John Glasby. It's offers an interesting insight, although the story itself is a little repetitive, as is to be expected.\n\n'The Whisperer and Other Stories' by Brian Lumley\n\nReferring back to the previous book, this particular anthology is the reason why we put a pause on 'Tales Out of Innsmouth'. If it was to take a vacation from Innsmouth, guess again. \"The Return of the Deep Ones,\" similar to most of those told in 'Shadows Over Innsmouth', spreads their tainted influence over to the shores of Britain. So far, so good. However, we may soon be swapping this for another of Lumley's anthologies, 'Return of the Deep Ones and Other Mythos Tales', and resume reading from there.\n\n__________________________________________\n\nThat's all for now, our Darkley Niche faithful, but we hope it is enough to rekindle the embers of those followers who have been patiently awaiting this long-overdue post \u2013 like Cthulhu in his deathless sleep. We'll aim to keep this weekly to biweekly, if able. A film or book review may well be in order, come next time we write again. Until then, dream darkly readers."
