Itching ears are everywhere. That is why gossip magazines are very popular. It gets the reader to be on top of the situation. \u201cAh, she is worse than I am.\u201d \u201cHe is no better than someone else I know, how can they be so bad?\u201d That feeling of superiority adds somehow to the self-confidence of the reader.\n\nKnowing that human weakness, it is the target of journalists to make the itch worsen that will surely make them scratch and scratch harder. With just the T.V. news, highlights will be said by the newscasters by asking questions to leave doubt in the hearer\u2019s mind. Did he, really? It makes the listener wait till the news is over\u2026just to find out it was just as hook. Try to listen from start to end, especially the gossip part.\n\nRecently, the issue with the Big Bad Blogger has proliferated the internet and enraged many of the Philippine bloggers. It was on print. It made the Philippine blogging network angry because the news item generalized the scope. It was not even proven whether the story is true or simply created. How about the Davao judge that shot the sheriff? Media got busted by critics for falsely accusing Judge Robillo with the Inquirer\u2019s error in its title and sub title that somehow have even reached media abroad, which has made the judge look terrible. Although Inquirer has managed to correct their mistakes, still, damage has been done. Plus, they only issued an erratum, not an apology.\n\nAnother one would be the Lopez Group on DBP Loans, where two writers from the same publication wrote about it, on the same day and using the same words, about certain loans that were said to be written off. According to Salvador Tirona, President of the Lopez Holdings, PR operatives who desperately want to muddle the current Senate investigation on the DBP scandal by diverting its focus, are behind said publicity. And weeks later, Oscar Lopez wrote The Lopez Group in Ordinary Times to explain their side. So all these three stories have a common denominator: wrong information by journalists that can somehow be said to be due to lack of research or one that is meant to stir chaos in the land.\n\nWhatever issues, if they are thrown by media, gets sensationalized and sadly, bears with them a negative impact on whoever is caught in between. Personally, I think this kind of blunder should take a halt as it will never do anyone, or anything any good. It\u2019s what will add up to the already chaotic environment we have. But then, you think journalists are the only ones doing this? How about false promotions to get more sales but deliver way below what is worth?\n\nA friendbooked a Cruise ship eat-all-you-can buffet at the price of P545/person. All that\u2019s in theirmind was the a once-in-a-lifetime experience of a dinner in a cruise ship. They booked online and waited for the day. Well, the ship\u2019s advertisements was quite appealing and who would not grab this privilege ?To their dismay, not onlywas the cruise ship old and rusty , all ofthem waited a long line just to get your food. The cruise ship offered only three main coursewhich were not enough for the people aboard the ship.\n\nIs it safe for me to say that even big food establishments attract customers with those delicious foodstuff plastered on their menus, with big posters hanged on their walls. The posters are so appealing that customers flock to buy it only to find that what they offer is much, much smaller that what appears on your.\n\nLet us all be fair in giving the public what is due to them. Honest, unbiased promotion or advertising that will not discredit others contribution to the well being of our society. We are in this together, media groups, journalists, writers, T.V. personalities, radio commentators and bloggers\u2026we all do what we love for the love of our fellowmen and for the transformation of our country. Positive change is what we should offer best."
