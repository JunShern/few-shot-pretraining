crowded in here.\" \"Everyone out, everyone out, come on!\" \"Not you, Scotty.\" \"Not you, Number 2.\" \"Not you, Frau.\" \"Not you, Goldmember.\" \"Not you guys back there.\" \"Not you henchman holding wrench.\" \"Not you henchman arbitrarily turning knobs making it seam like your doing something.\" \"This is uncomfortable!\" \"The tiny one can't take a hint.\" \"He doesn't understand, He's small.\" \"Hello Foxxy.\" \"Austin.\" \"We've comfirmed what Fat Bastard told you about Roboto is accurate.\" \"He was hired by Dr. Evil to contruct Preparation H.\" \"So Roboto had the technology to build Goldmember's tractorbeam.\" \"Which means Roboto will lead us to Goldmember.\" \"Which means Goldmember will lead us to my father.\" \" You speak Japanese?\" \" A little.\" \"Well you might be a cunning linguist, but I'm a master debator.\" \"I'm looking for my father.\" \"He was kidnapped.\" \"Please eat what?\" \"Wait.\" \"He said: \"Please eat some shitake mushrooms.\"\" \"Tell me.\" \"What do you know about...s...my father's where...about...s.\" \"You're ass is happy?\" \"No!\" \"He said: \"Your assignment is an unhappy one\".\" \"Nice potty-mouth, dirtbag.\" \"Yes.\" \"Quite off topic, thank you very much.\" \"Why don't I just speak in English?\" \"That would be a good idea, now wouldn't it?\" \"That way I wouldn't miss-read the subtitles   making you it seem like you're saying that are dirty.\" \"I'm sorry to hear about your father.\" \"But I can't help you.\" \"Please excuse me.\" \"I have another appointment.\" \"By the way...\" \"Mr. Roboto is lying to us.\" \"Tell me something I don't know.\" \"I open-mouth kissed a horse once.\" \" Say-what?\" \" That's something you don't know.\" \"My spider-senses tells me that my father is still in this building.\" \"You keep a look out.\" \"I'm gonna try to sneak in.\" \"Sha-zam!\" \"Come on, sugar.\" \"There is Goldmember and Roboto.\" \"Yesh.\" \"Very impressive put Preparation H into my stooping transporten.\" \"You need this to tone the tractorbeam.\" \"It's a gold key.\" \"Smarty pants.\" \"Let's spread out.\" \"Hands up, Goldmember!\" \"It's payback time.\" \"Sure you can kill me.\" \"But then, what happens to Austin Powers' fassia?\" \"Dad!\" \"Yesh!\" \"And now he's going to have an unfortunate smelting accident.\" \"Don't worry dad!\" \"I'm here to rescue you.\" \"May I point out, that last time around you fell into to an obvious trap.\" \"Now your're trying to save me instead of stopping Goldmember.\" \"Please, I'm not gonna let Goldmember get away!\" \"Austin, Goldmember is getting away.\" \"Hello, hello, aren't you gonna introduce us Austin?\" \"Foxxy, this is...\" \"Powers.\" \"Nigel Powers.\" \"Is that Eau de Fleuratia your wearing?\" \"Yes, it is.\" \"That's how a woman should smell.\" \"Especially one as beautiful as you.\" \"My my...even in the face of danger you live up to your reputation.\" \"Get on with it!\" \"I got an idea.\" \"Your spycar is a mini.\" \"It's not the size mate.\" \"It's how you use it.\" \"You know I would have found my way out, very well.\" \"What?\" \"I saved your life!\" \"Listen.\" \"Should have been doing your job!\" \"Oh, your welcome, mate.\" \"Shut up and turn around, please!\" \"Run!\" \"It's Godzilla!\" \"It looks like Godzilla.\" \"But due to International Copyright Laws...it's not.\" \"Still we should run, like it is Godzilla!\" \"Though it isn't.\" \"There is Goldmember.\" \"Greater-greater one-niner, this is Goldie-van.\" \"Over.\" \"10-4 there, Goldie-van this is Rubber-ducky, what's your ten-twenty?\" \"Over.\" \"I've got Preparation H in rear and smoke in the barrel of my backdoor...\" \"Viva las convoy.\" \"Over.\" \"Yee-haa.\" \"Copy that you son-of-a-bitch powder of monkeynuts.\" \"Open wide there Rubber-ducky, I'm entering your mouth now.\" \"Over.\" \"Great, Goldmember got away.\" \"Now what?\" \"I think it's obvious, we should take Dr. Evil's lair by force.\" \" You can be my backup, son.\" \" Backup?\" \"Well that's fairly condescending.\" \"Do you think Dr. Evil's is gonna expect an attack?\" \"We should infiltrate his lair.\" \"It's aint my first rodeo, cowboy.\" \"We need commandos, scuba...gadgets for god-sake.\" \"Well, I don't like to use gadgets.\" \"Outside the bedroom, I thank you...\" \"You know.\" \"I think being frozen, damaged your brain.\" \"Really?\" \"And how would you know?\" \"This is the most time we ever spent together, since...ever!\" \"What are you saying, son?\" \"What boy learned to drive a car with machineguns on it?\" \"Or had a helicopter you could fit in a nutsack?\" \"What about you Swedish nanny, Helga?\" \"Oh, yes, Helga!\" \"Let's say I didn't hire her for the cooking.\" \"She stayed on, until you were 24.\" \"We were mates you and I.\" \"I didn't need a friend.\" \"I needed a father.\" \"You know I have risked my life trying to save you.\" \"And you still don't give me any respect.\" \"Respect?\" \"Come on.\" \"If you got an issue, here's your tissue.\" \"That is not funny.\" \"Well, I suppose we better go our seperate ways then?\" \"Fine.\" \"Fine.\" \"So.\" \"I've been assigned to welcome you to the Ministry of Defense.\" \"I have a letter from my director personally thanking you for switching sides.\" \"I...can't wait to inform Austin of your defection.\" \"Oh.\" \"Hello Basil.\" \"Yes, Austin should be here any second.\" \"Yes, I'm in Austin's hotel room right now.\" \"Assasin!\" \"Try to kill me will ya?\" \"Oh.\" \"You wanna be friends, huh?\" \"Wait a tick.\" \"I'm not falling for that again!\" \"But, at least he didn't mention it.\" \"Yes, I realize he can't talk.\" \"Listen I think Dr. Evil treated him badly.\" \"And that's why he has decided to help us.\" \"Come back here, you little bugger.\" \"Oh, yes.\" \"I'm sure Austin and Mini-Me, will get along famously.\" \"I guarantee nothing will happen to Mini-Me in my watch.\" \"Come here you bugger, I got ya.\" \"Oh, I think he and Austin will be united   in their commitment to the mission of stopping Dr. Evil.\" \"Austin.\" \"There you are.\" \"I have come to tell you the good news.\" \"Mini-Me has...\" \" switched sides.\" \"Sorry about that, old chap.\" \"Welcome aboard.\" \"My mole-stake.\" \"What was that?\" \"Listen.\" \"Just get it out of you system.\" \" No I'm fine.\" \" I insist.\" \"We could work together

\"Okay, everyone prepare to dive.\" \"This spycar is also a submarine.\" \"Get me the World Organization.\" \"What is it, Dr. Evil?\" \"Gentlemen.\" \"In a matter of hours a meteor will crash into Earth causing a global flood.\" \"That is of course unless you pay me.\" \"1 billion-gezillion-fefillion...  million...yen.\" \"I think you're bluffing.\" \"Well perhaps you would like a demonstration?\" \"Number 2 the key, please.\" \"Sir, Dr. Evil is not bluffing.\" \"One of our satellites is falling out of orbit.\" \"Which one?\" \"It's the one that looks like a pair of...\"

\"What?\" \"Dr. Evil is not your son.\" \"I am.\" \"You both are.\" \"What?\" \"It was our first...family holiday together.\" \"Just as I was finishing a case.\" \"Your mother brought the two of you to Belgium.\" \"I stopped to have a tinkle.\" \"When the car...\" \"But, my parents died in a car accident.\" \"It was no accident.\" \"\u00cct was an assasination attempt.\" \"I though only Austin survived.\" \"I should have told you the truth earlier.\" \"But those Belgians, they made you so damn...evil.\" \"Of course they share border with Dutch.\" \"Very interesting story, Mr. Powers.\" \"Of

hate you!\" \"I hate you!\" \"I don't even know you, but I hate you too.\" \"And I especially hate you!\" \"You'll pay.\" \"You'll all pay!\" \"I'd like to point out that no one else in my gene pool

and be your backup.\" \"Ducky, what do we do?\" \"I'm not really a \"hands-on-evil-genius\".\" \"Think you were always the smart one.\" \"I could re-write the output capacity to the tractorbeam   from one of the conduit boxes up there.\" \"Come on, let's go.\" \"Yesh!\" \"The shooting begins.\" \"Let me shoot!\" \"You know, Dr. Evil.\" \"I used to think you were crazy.\" \"I know.\" \"But now I can
