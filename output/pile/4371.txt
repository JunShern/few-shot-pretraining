Many thanks to Triple R for having us on to talk about the Alcohol Cutdown Coach app, how it came about and how it can be utilized by people who want to cut down on their alcohol use.\n\nFor anybody interested in listening to the interview in full, here it is. We will look to upload a full transcript of the interview in due course as well.\n\nOne complaint that is rarely heard these days is that people have too much time. Although this may be true for a small minority, many of us feel the pressures of everyday life eating away at more and more of our day. Whether you\u2019re working, staying at home with the kids or otherwise, you may find like many others that once the working day is done you just have time to get the kids fed and bathed and in bed, ditto yourself, and barely have any time at all left over. And the little amount of time you do have is spent recovering from an exhausting day. You might also find that as soon as you get home you habitually try to unwind by pouring yourself a beer or a wine. This may help you to relax, but have you found that once you do that it\u2019s so much harder to do everything else? And once you\u2019re on the couch having a drink, how difficult is it to get back up again?\n\nWhat if you spent a few nights each week breaking out of the habit and spending some time playing with the kids, gardening outside, going for a run \u2013 whatever you choose! And while you\u2019re at it why not turn off the tv as well \u2013 you\u2019ll be amazed at how much extra time you can find. Not only this, but the spare time you do have will be made more productive because you\u2019re not feeling so sleepy from alcohol \u2013 so it\u2019s a double win. And as you increase your exercise and natural relaxation, the process becomes even more effective.\n\nDon\u2019t forget too, without alcohol your sleep can be more refreshing; perhaps you\u2019ll need less of it and be able to get up that little bit earlier, which reclaims even more time.\n\nBut don\u2019t take our word for it \u2013 download the Alcohol Cutdown Coach app, set a number of days per week that you want to test the theory out and go for it today!\n\n]]>http://alcoholcutdowncoach.com/reasons-you-should-download-the-alcohol-cutdown-coach-app-reason-3/feed/0Reasons you should download the Alcohol Cutdown Coach app. Reason # 2http://alcoholcutdowncoach.com/reasons-you-should-download-the-alcohol-cutdown-coach-app-reason-2/\nhttp://alcoholcutdowncoach.com/reasons-you-should-download-the-alcohol-cutdown-coach-app-reason-2/#respondWed, 22 Apr 2015 05:11:04 +0000http://alcoholcutdowncoach.com/?p=61Continue reading \u2192]]>Reason # 2: You are spending more money than you would like on alcohol.\n\nUnless you\u2019re growing a beer tree at your house, chances are if you drink alcohol, then that alcohol is costing you money. And because alcohol consumption can become such a habit for some, that money can really add up over time. So now you can see what people mean when they talk about peeing their money up against the wall!! Why not do a little experiement and write down how much you think you drink on average, on the days that you consume alcohol. Then have a think about what that is costing you each time and write that figure down. Now, bear in mind that every time you have an extra AFD (i.e. when you deliberately, and in conjunction with the Alcohol Cutdown Coach app, refrain from drinking any alcohol on a day that you otherwise might have opted to drink), that amount on average is roughly what you could be saving each time!!\n\nWhen you download the Alcohol Cutdown Coach app, don\u2019t forget to use the customise feature \u2013 that will let you input all the information we\u2019ve just mentioned above and the app will help you to keep track of the money you\u2019re saving. And of course if you have a particular goal in mind (i.e. saving enough money to pay for a holiday, or enough to finance a particular gift to yourself), that will give you all the more motivation to stick to your goals. And then you really will have something tangible to show for all your hard work!\n\n]]>http://alcoholcutdowncoach.com/reasons-you-should-download-the-alcohol-cutdown-coach-app-reason-2/feed/0Reasons you should download the Alcohol Cutdown Coach app. Reason #1http://alcoholcutdowncoach.com/reasons-you-should-download-the-alcohol-cutdown-coach-app/\nhttp://alcoholcutdowncoach.com/reasons-you-should-download-the-alcohol-cutdown-coach-app/#respondTue, 21 Apr 2015 02:59:31 +0000http://alcoholcutdowncoach.com/?p=58Continue reading \u2192]]>Hi there, beginning today we are going to make a series of posts about why it might be a great idea for you to cut down on your alcohol consumption and increase your Alcohol Free Days.\n\nOf course most of these also double as reasons why you should download the Alcohol Cutdown Coach app and start using it today\u2026. There are a multitude of reasons why this app could help you to change your life, so be sure to stay tuned to these posts!!!\n\nReason #1 : You are frequently hung over.\n\nMany of us know how it feels like to wake up with a terrible hangover. This awful feeling is often accompanied by confusion about the events of the night before, as well as guilt and remorse. And of course it\u2019s just so difficult to get much else done when you feel weak and debilitated. Did you stay out late on a Friday night and spend all day Saturday feeling sick? That\u2019s HALF YOUR WEEKEND GONE \u2013 what a waste!!\n\nHave you ever woken up in this state and said to yourself: \u201cNever again\u201d?! Perhaps you actually followed through on this for a time as well. But for how long did you stick to your promise? If you really want to reduce the amount of time that you are spending hung over (and simultaneously reap all of the other benefits associated with drinking less), it\u2019s important to have a plan, and to stick to it. And of course sticking to it means monitoring your progress as you go. Starting today, why not pick a number of AFDs that you want to achieve and use our app to help you achieve this \u2013 spending less time hung over could be one of the many resulting benefits!\n\nA new app released this month for iPhone and iPad assists users to track and increase the regularity of their Alcohol Free Days (AFDs) and to improve their health.\n\nApril, 2015 \u2013 available now in the App Store, Alcohol Cutdown Coach is designed for people looking to improve their lifestyle, bank balance and calorie intake by introducing or maintaining alcohol free days into their usual routine. It\u2019s a way to set alcohol free day goals for yourself and track them (with the help of reminders) in a fun and motivating way.\n\nUsers select a date range and nominate the number of AFDs that they wish to achieve. They then track their AFDs with daily reminders appearing on their device. Over time the app provides a graphical summary of how the user is performing. Users can also input their own drinking habits, allowing the app to provide further statistics such as calories and money saved.\n\n\u201cBoth my husband and myself were looking for a fun challenge to help us become more energised, lose weight and save money\u201d, says co-developer Vanessa. \u201cWe\u2019d tried abstaining over certain months, such as \u2018Feb Fast\u2019 and \u2018Dry July\u2019, which was great, but these didn\u2019t really modify our lifestyle choices long term. Likewise, setting a hard and fast rule such as \u201cno drinking from Monday to Friday\u201d is so rigid it gets difficult to maintain. We wanted a tool to help us to look at our long term habits, then set and track goals to improve them. Plus we wanted the flexibility to pick and choose which days to abstain and when we could have an occasional drink\u2026. This app is the result.\u201d\n\nAlcohol Cutdown Coach is currently available in most countries worldwide for iPhone and iPad. It costs $0.99 in the US and is priced accordingly in other regions. Age restrictions apply.
