    "text": "Steelheart has been nominated for another regional award, the 2016 Pacific Northwest Library Association Young Readers\u2019 Choice Award, the oldest children\u2019s choice award in the U.S. and Canada. It was established in 1940 by Seattle bookseller Harry Hartman, who believed every student should have an opportunity to select a book that gives him or her pleasure.\n\nNews organizations are reporting that Carter Blanchard (of the new Independence Day and Glimmer) has been tapped by Fox as the screenwriter for the Steelheart movie adaptation currently under development for Shawn Levy\u2019s 21 Laps. (Shawn Levy is the director/producer of Real Steel and Night at the Museum.) You can read one story at this link.\n\nIn this week\u2019s Writing Excuses episode, Q&A on Middles, with Marie Brennan, Marie joins us again to help us field your questions about middles. Here are your questions that we collected from social media:\n\nHow do you maintain interest without having something explode every other chapter?\n\nIn short fiction, how do you prevent try-fail cycles from bloating the story?\n\nHow do you prevent the introduction of POVs during the middle of the story from being jarring?\n\nHow do you keep subplots from turning into side quests?\n\nIn longer stories, how important are \u201cbreather\u201d chapters that ease the tension?\n\nDo you have methods for weaving plot and subplot threads together? Do you outline this, or keep it in your head?\n\nLast week, in Tor.com\u2019s continuing reread posts for Words of Radiance, Kaladin went out for drinks with the guys and met some decidedly problematic patriots. This week, in Chapter 47, Shallan continues her researches into Urithiru and Lightweaving, with dubious help from Pattern.\n\nMy assistant Adam has updated the Twitter post archive for July."
