    "text": "Per AppleInsider, Apple on Tuesday introduced AppleCare+ for iPhone, a new extended warranty service that combines traditional tech support, software support, and hardware support with the addition of the company\u2019s first accidental damage plan.\n\nLike the traditional $US69 version of AppleCare for iPhone that it replaces, the new US$99 AppleCare+ for iPhone extends an iPhone\u2019s repair coverage and technical support to two years from the original purchase date but also adds coverage for up to two incidents of accidental damage due to an owner\u2019s poor handling of the device.\n\nEach accidental damage incident is subject to a US$49 service fee and is available only for the iPhone and its original included accessories. In turn, Apple promises that the replacement equipment it provides to customers taking advantage of the \u201cmay be new or equivalent to new in both performance and reliability\u201d (meaning either a new iPhone or a certified refurbished one).\n\nAppleCare+ also bundles standard AppleCare features, such as software troubleshooting and telephone-based technical support, while also offering customers with repair needs the option for mail-in or carry-in repairs, and an express replacement service.\n\niPhones that exhibit defects in materials, workmanship or see their battery charge fall by 50 percent or more from original specification, remain eligible for a replacement from Apple at no cost under the new plan. Apple also notes that customers must purchased AppleCare+ together with their new iPhone, with the safest bet being to have both items appear on the same receipt (fine print).\n\nFor Apple, the new service marks the first time that company has offered accidental coverage for drops, spills, and other incidents caused by the owner. Previously, iPhone customers seeking full coverage of their device were left to seek out pricey third-party alternatives that sell for the same price or more.\n\nReplacement costs for an out-of-contract iPhone can cost hundreds to replace new or US$200 previously though Apple\u2019s Out-of-Warranty Service.\n\nYes. You can purchase a replacement iPhone from the Apple Online Store, an Apple Retail Store, or your carrier\u2019s store. Your price will depend on whether you qualify for a carrier subsidy. You can also purchase an unlocked iPhone from the Apple Online Store or Apple Retail Store and obtain a micro-SIM card directly from your supported GSM carrier.\n\nWhen I buy from the Apple Online Store, does my iPhone come ready to use?\n\nYes, if you have selected a mobile phone carrier. When your iPhone arrives, all you have to do is turn it on and follow the onscreen instructions to set it up. There\u2019s no need to call the carrier or visit a store to complete the activation. If you have selected an unlocked GSM phone, you will need to acquire a micro-SIM from the supported GSM carrier of your choice and activate it in order to use your iPhone.\u201d\n\nInformation in a footnote on both that page and the iPhone 4S tech specs page further suggests the iPhone 4S will be available unlocked:\n\nFor those who are not qualified customers, are not eligible for an early upgrade, are purchasing an unlocked iPhone (for supported GSM wireless service provider networks only), or wish to buy an iPhone as a gift, see your carrier, an Apple Retail Store Specialist, the Apple Online Store, or an Apple Authorized Reseller for pricing.\n\nNo official pricing info for unlocked iPhone 4S models is available yet, though the 8 GB iPhone 4, available for US$99 with a 2-year contract, costs $549 without a contract. Extrapolating from the iPhone 4\u2019s pricing suggests the following pricing scheme for unlocked models:\n\n\u2013 A \u201cSiri\u201d feature will allow you to give spoken commands (such as \u201cWhat will the weather be like today?\u201d to the device).\n\n\u2013 Siri will allow you to reply to texts while the device is in a pocket and will allow for a reply text with a Bluetooth headset.\n\n\u2013 Siri\u2019s interface is both onscreen as well as audio, the feature being hardware-dependent and running on the iPhone 4S only.\n\n\u2013 Siri will apparently read a text message to you and ask you questions as to how you\u2019d like to reply.\n\n\u2013 Siri can do dictations for emails too, the app placing a microphone next to the space bar in the keyboard. The app will start as a beta in the U.S., U.K., Australia, French and German with more languages and services coming.\n\n\u2013 The iPhone 4S apparently features an identical screen size to the current iPhone 4.\n\n\u2013 And now, your long-awaited pricing and capacities for the iPhone 4S: 16GB for US$199, 32GB for US$299 and 64 GB for US$399.\n\n\u2013 The iPhone 3G can now be purchased new for US$49.\n\n\u2013 Sprint has now been added to the list of iPhone wireless carriers along with AT&T and Verizon.\n\n\u2013 Pre-orders for the iPhone 4S begin Friday, October 7th.\n\n\u2013 The iPhone 4S will be released on Friday, October 14th.\n\n\u2013 The iPhone 4S will be available in 22 additional countries on October 28th and reach 70 countries by the end of 2011.\n\nPer iPhone-Ticker.de, Apple\u2019s iPhone 4S has recently appeared in the inventory list for Vodafone\u2019s German division.\n\nThe device was spotted in listings for various iPhone accessories on the mobile carrier\u2019s website. The listing includes both white and black models of the iPhone 4S in 16, 32, and 64 GB capacities. These sizes and colors match perfectly with one expectation for the next generation iPhone model.\n\nFortunately, we only have to wait about 24 hours to find out whether Apple is releasing either the iPhone 4S, the iPhone 5 or both.\n\nWith all of one day to go prior to its much-anticipated iPhone media announcement, an iTunes beta is telling more than it should about Apple\u2019s forthcoming product line.\n\nPer AppleInsider, references to the much-used \u201ciPhone 4S\u201d moniker could be found in the Info.plist file of the MobileDevices bundle that was included with the ninth beta of iTune 10.5 released on Friday.\n\nThe discovery can be seen as further evidence that Apple is gearing up to introduce iPhones next Tuesday, Oct. 4th that bundle an 8MP camera, 512MB of RAM, support for HSPA+ and the iPad 2\u2019s A5 processor and dual graphics, but do so in a the current CMDA iPhone 4 design.\n\nHowever, the new iPhone 4S is expected to be a dual-mode phone, meaning the same iPhone 4S can be used on either CDMA or GSM networks. Currently, Apple markets separate iPhone 4 models for CDMA and GSM networks.\n\nTalk of Apple taking a dual-route strategy this year by releasing both an iPhone 4S and a more advanced iPhone 5 began to cool off this week, with leaked parts and casings all pointing to a product dubbed iPhone 4S.\n\nIn addition, insider Ming-Chi Kuo reported that his industry checks turned up no sign of a redesigned iPhone 5 in the pipeline. Instead, he stated that Apple was manufacturing a model that looks largely the same as the current iPhone 4, only with an improved antenna design.\n\nDubbed \u201cN94,\u201d the new iPhone model will reportedly also use the same Gorilla glass for its back panel. Kuo also said it will be available in both black and white models at launch, and 60 percent of units assembled so far have been of the black variety.\n\nEchoing a report from earlier this month, he also said that Foxconn will be responsible for manufacturing 85 percent of Apple\u2019s fifth-generation iPhone units. The other 15 percent will reportedly be assembled by Pegatron.\n\nEach will run iOS 5, which is rumored to bundle new voice recognition technology in the form of a new application dubbed Assistant, which will allow users to speak to their iPhone and accomplish a number of tasks through natural language, like sending text messages, looking up information, or scheduling an appointment.\n\nThe functionality is believed to stem from Siri, a \u201cpersonal assistant\u201d application for the iPhone that Apple purchased in April of 2010.\n\nPer MacRumors, a picture showing iPhone 5 cases entered into the carrier\u2019s inventory system, more evidence has emerged that AT&T has begun stocking third-party iPhone 5 cases days before Apple is expected to unveil its next handset.\n\nAn alleged store employee at an AT&T retail store sent to MacRumors photos of newly arrived silicone sleeves for the as-yet-unannounced \u201ciPhone 5.\u201d The product appears to be a low-end generic case, as it carries no distinguishable brand, is simply labeled \u201ccell phone accessory\u201d and comes in oversized packaging.\n\nThe sleeve features a tapered design with the mute switch on the right side of the device, resembling purported iPhone 5 cases that have proliferated in China for months.\n\nHowever, the publication took care to note that the cases run against the \u201cgrowing feeling that Apple may not be releasing such a device\u201d because of recent evidence suggesting that Apple\u2019s design for its next iPhone may be \u201cnearly identical to the iPhone 4.\u201d\n\nEarlier on Thursday, a leaked photo allegedly of AT&T\u2019s inventory system surfaced, showing entries for iPhone 5 hard case, soft case and skin products from Case-Mate. The case maker had previously posted its case designs on its website, but took them down shortly after they went up.\n\nAnticipation for the next-generation iPhone reached a fever pitch after Apple sent out invitations to an event next Tuesday, Oct. 4, with the tagline \u201cLet\u2019s talk iPhone.\u201d The tagline has prompted renewed speculation that Apple will include voice recognition features on its fifth-generation smartphone. The next iPhone is widely believed to feature the A5 processor found in the iPad 2 and an 8-megapixel camera.\n\nThere has been some disagreement, however, about whether Apple will introduce a redesigned iPhone 4 in addition to a new model. It had been suggested that Apple was looking to release a cheaper iPhone 4S alongside the iPhone 5, but recent reports have poured cold water on the rumor.\n\nA series of purporting to be the structural case design for a revamped, cheaper new iPhone 4 indicate changes in its antenna design.\n\nThe images, published by MacRumors and iPatchiPods, appear to show a unibody frame without case seams on the top or either side of the top of the phone.\n\nExisting GSM iPhone 4 models sold by AT&T and other global carriers have a single seam on the top, while the Verizon CDMA model has two seams on either side of the top end.\n\nThe seams separate the external edge of the iPhone 4 into antenna segments; the GSM model has two antennas (one for mobile use and one for WiFi/Bluetooth/GPS, as shown below) while the CDMA model has three (dual mobile antennas required in the CDMA specification and a WiFi/Bluetooth/GPS segment).\n\nThe modified case also incorporates a SIM card, something that only the existing GSM version of the current iPhone 4 has or needs.\n\nIt\u2019s not yet known whether the anticipated new cheaper iPhone 4 (sometimes referred to as the \u201ciPhone 4S\u201d) will be dual band, allowing it to work on both major mobile network types. It is expected that the separate iPhone 5 model, bearing an original new design, will support both networks.\n\nThe primary feature of the new iPhone 4 phone design is expected to be its reduced cost, achieved through the use of streamlined components and a smaller 8GB of storage capacity.\n\nA similarly purported \u201ciPhone 5\u201d prototype case design appeared in January, similarly lacking seams on the top two sides, instead bearing a single seam on the top.\n\nThe report also portrays a bottom frame segment that appears to lack a defined Home button, suggesting that Apple may change the appearance and design of the Home button on the phones it releases later this fall.\n\nInterestingly enough, it\u2019s the upcoming cases that tend to provide the most interesting tidbits.\n\nPer UK web site MobileFun.co.uk, a leaked schematic claimed to be for a case for Apple\u2019s anticipated fifth-generation iPhone shows a larger area for the home button, a slightly larger screen, and the return of curved sides like on the iPhone 3GS.\n\nThe documents allegedly come from a Chinese case manufacturer and show a design with curved sides, similar to iPhone models released before the current iPhone 4.\n\nOn the front, the case appears to have a larger, oval-shaped opening for where the device\u2019s home button would go. That could lend support to rumors from earlier this year that Apple\u2019s next-iPhone would feature a multi-touch \u201cgesture area\u201d in place of the current home button.\n\nThat same report also predicted that Apple\u2019s next iPhone would have a slightly larger 3.7-inch edge-to-edge screen. The images that claim to show a so-called \u201ciPhone 5\u201d case also suggest that the device may have a larger screen.\n\nThe photos show the handset\u2019s volume buttons and SIM card slot in the same place, but also show placement of the vibrate switch on the opposite side.\n\nThe case also suggests the device will feature an unmoved LED camera flash, which would contradict purported fifth-generation iPhone parts (1, 2), which leaked in May and suggested the camera lens and flash would be moved further apart to improve picture quality. Separating the camera flash and lens can reduce the red-eye effect seen in photographs.\n\nThe alleged schematic would contradict other rumors that the next iPhone will have a design largely similar to the current iPhone 4, with one of the biggest changes being a new, higher-resolution 8-megapixel camera and the addition of the A5 processor. Some reports have characterized the device as an \u201ciPhone 4S,\u201d in references to the alleged minor changes.\n\nThough the next iPhone will arrive later than usual this year, reports from Apple\u2019s supply chain have been picking up, indicating that the company is preparing to begin mass production of the next-generation device. Last week, during the company\u2019s quarterly earnings conference call, Apple executives revealed that an unnamed major product transition is in the cards to take place by the end of September.\n\nStay tuned for additional details as they become available and let us know what\u2019s on your mind in the comments.\n\nThe time to the iPhone 5\u2019s release is apparently now two months and counting.\n\nPer Digitimes, Apple is rumored to have ordered 15 million iPhone 5 units from Taiwanese notebook manufacturer Pegatron Technology has received orders for 15 million units from Apple. The company has declined to comment on the report.\n\nPegatron produced somewhere in the region of four million iPhone 4s for Apple in the first quarter of 2011, though due to a slump in iPhone 4 sales this figure was well down on the 10 million it had prepared to manufacture.\n\nThe shipping date won\u2019t come as a surprise to industry-watchers: Apple traditionally holds a music-themed event in September and rumours that the next-generation iPhone would be announced then strengthened after no new iPhone was revealed during June\u2019s Worldwide Developer Conference.\n\nHowever, the reports do seem to contradict earlier information from Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty that suggested iPhone 5 production would not begin until mid- to late August.\n\nDigitimes reports that the iPhone 5 \u201cdoes not seem to have any major update from iPhone 4\u201d and refers to it as the iPhone 4S at one stage in the article.\n\nMeanwhile, the same outlet reports that production of touch sensors for the iPad 2 has reached five million a month."
