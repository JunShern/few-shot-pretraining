    "text": "Q:\n\nSAP UI5 embed manifest.json right\n\nI just wrote the description file for my UI5 application. \nNow I have these questions: \n\nWhere and how can I embed the manifest.json in my project correctly?\nHow can I test if it's working fine? (correctly embedded)\nIs the \"start_url\": \"\" similar to initialPage of the index.html?\n\nMany thanks for your guidance,\nChris\n\nA:\n\nUsually, the manifest.json file  (aka. \"Application Descriptor\") is put into the same folder as where the Component.js file is located. The component will look for the file name \"manifest.json\" in the same folder. If the descriptor is located somewhere else or has a different file name, assign the relative URL of the file to the manifestUrl in the component factory function like this, which is recommended to do so anyway because it ...\n\nloads the descriptor file before creating the component (same as manifestFirst) allowing us to preload dependencies and model data to improve the initial loading time.\nmakes specifying the name of the component redundant.  \n\nYou can either pass the name of the component or the URL of the descriptor file to load [the component] via the descriptor.\n\nTo see if the file is correctly embedded, run the app and see if e.g.\n\nthe rootView is loaded,\nmodels (for example ResourceModel for i18n) are set to the component instance,\ncustom resources assigned to sap.ui5/resources are loaded, etc. etc..\n\u2192 Make sure to include (or in case of manifestFirst/ manifestUrl, don't be tempted to remove) manifest declaration in the component metadata.\n\nThe \"start_url\" is purely advisory and meant for the web standard rather than for UI5. It's telling the browser where to look for the initial page when the user starts the web app.\n\nTo learn more about the descriptor file, take a look at the developer guide such as \"Descriptor for Applications\" or as a summary, here.\n\n"
