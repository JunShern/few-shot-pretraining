    "text": "EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW: GORELUST (CANADA).\n\nGORELUST from Rimouski, Quebec (Canada) was one of the most brutal bands around at that time (1995) and were regarded as one of the very best live act in the province, kicking everbody\u2019s ass everywhere they played. Then, quickly, to everyone\u2019s irony they disbanded right after their first album \u2018Reign of Lunacy\u2019 but after almost 18 years the same album will be re-issued via PRC MUSIC.\n\nDuring a time when so called \u2018Bigger\u2019 Old School Death Metal bands have failed to deliver the traditional tunes, this re-issue will please many OSDM fans for sure. Listening to \u2018Reign of Lunacy\u2019 is like injecting molten lava into your veins. It\u2019ll burn you down to ashes. Mark my fucking words!!! The record isn\u2019t trying to sound old school because it is old school.\n\nI caught up with Jean (Vocals) to talk about the past and the near future plans of GORELUST, the re-issue of Reign of Lunacy\u2019 and much more. Check:\n.\n\n.\n\nHello Jean, thank you for your time. How is GORELUST doing after all these years of silence?\n-Hi! Actually about a few weeks ago Gorelust was still in coma since 1996..:-) The band\nhas been awake for a few weeks now\u2026 And its doing very good! Everything is at an early stage\nright now but we have a strong desire to be heard again.\n\n.The band split up after its first Kick Ass FL \u2018Reign of Lunacy\u2019, what went wrong?\n-At the time we were very young and everyone was trying to make plans for the future.\nWe had a few really killers songs ready to be recorded but were missing another 5-6 tracks to\ncomplete a second album. I remember the writing process was so long and everyone in the band\nwas planning their own life. We began to lose hope for a possible future for the band\u2026 Actually\nnot every members was ready for the next step; more gigs or touring. You got to understand that\nwe were so young a the times\u2026 We were still living with our parents\u2026 Hahahaha..:-)\nWe played a lot of gigs but not real touring on a long duration. Ressources were also very limited\nat the times\u2026 No internet to comunicate and organized things for the band. We were located in a\nsmall city about 5-6 hours drive from the main city. So we were kind of sucessfull locally but to\nexpand our boundaries was kind of hard.I really would have like to go out with the band, to\nreach the next step. But it never happened. I decided to make different plans for my future and i\nleft the band in 1996. I moved to Montreal city to study sound enginneering. The band tried to\nreplaced me at first but it was just not the same and a few months after that the band call it quit.\n\n.\u2026and thankfully the band has reformed now. What took it 18 odd years to come out with such a noblethought and idea? It\u2019s great news for old fans who have known the band since its earlier days and for the newlisteners alike.\n\n-With internet now everything is so different. I\u2019ve always kept a close look on the Reign of Lunacy album. Always found different reviews and peoples talking about it over the world. I was reading about it and I was saying to myself that it would be amazing to do other album. In all honestly, I think that the newer material was even better than Reign of Lunacy. I really like the 1st album but with the new material the band had find their own style. It was just more brutal and more mature.The band was young and everyone were evolving musically.\nAbout a year ago I met with the drummer Francis Marmen. He was playing with another band in Montreal. I went there to see him and we had a few beers together talking about the past but also about a possible future for a second album. So we kept that in mind and a month ago we decided to actually doing it. To clarify thing, we are not reforming as a touring band. The goal is to make a second album. A kick-ass second album. Like we supposed to do back in 1996. Everyone has their own lives now and just the fact to do a follow-up album is actually an amazing thing for us. We\u2019ll see about others possible things after that. I really can\u2019t wait to do it!\n\nWho else from the original line-up can we find in this reformation?\n-For the moment we have myself Jean Beaulieu on vocals, Francis Marmen on drums\nand Pascal Chevrier on bass. Only the guitarist needs to be confirmed. There is the possibility to\nalso have the original guitarist onboard with us. We\u2019ll see. The goal was to have the most original\nmembers as possible and its looking very good! It will sound like Gorelust. This is the point of\ndoing it.\n\n.Can you recall the \u2018Reign of Lunacy\u2019 days? The same scene has grown bigger now. How was it backthen?\n-It was amazing. Death metal was still evolving and we were buying a lot of new albums\nand discovering new brutal music every weeks. The band was pretty succesfull in the Rimouski\n(our hometown) area and the shows were very special moments. We had the chance to play with a lot of big names bands and we have so great memories of that. We played also in a lot of different cities in the province of Quebec and a lot of peoples were coming to the shows. I will always remember the gigs we played with Deicide, Suffocation, Gorguts, Cannibal Corpse and a lof of others. The big mosh pits, everything was crazy.\nBrutal music was more of an underground thing and death metal fans were really into their\nmusic. They were proud of it actually. The scene today is not that different. What really changed\nthe scene was the coming of internet in our everyday lifes. It opened so many possibilities. Back\nin the days, I was answering every interviews by the mail, everything was slower. With internet,\ncommunication between bands, labels, distributors is so different now\u2026\n\n.The Reissue of your debut FL (a must have for all OSDM fans) is a great news indeed. How excitedis the band and how do you think the new listeners will take it?\n-To see the album reissued is a really cool thing for us. Copies of the original edition\nwere selling for 60-80 US $ so it was really limited to death metal collector\u2019s. Now new peoples\ncan discover it and hear what mid 90\u2019s death metal was about\u2026Everything was played by the\nband and not digitally enhanced. This is a raw and straight to the face underground death metal\nalbum. Back in the days that was the point of playing death metal. Brutal and technical music\nplayed by extreme music musicians. I hope that the reissue will bring new fans for the band. Yes,\nit is oldschool but the album did aged pretty well I think. Songs are made of lot of riffs and\ndifferent parts so peoples have to listen to it a few times before getting it. The production has a\ninteresting direct approach. Everything was recorded and mixed in 7 days. Old school way.\nEverything on analog tape. No protools or enhanced performances.\nWe really have to thank R\u00e9mi C\u00f4t\u00e9 who is the owner of PRC music who decided to re-release it.\nHe was also the man responsible for the original release of the album in 1995. On New World\nSymphony records. So he always believed in this brutal underground album and we can\u2019t thank\nhim enough for that. All our respect to him.\n\n.Talking about your upcoming new release, when can we expect it to come out? \u2013For now everything is at an early stage. It was decided just a few weeks ago. We are\nfinalizing the line-up and after that will begin the writting process. I would say near the end of\n2013. Maybe faster but we\u2019ll wait to see how things are going before announcing release date.\n\n.What can we expect in terms of sound and influence of the band in the new releases? Have youplanned to stick to the roots and old sound or there are surprises in coming?\n-This will be the 2nd Gorelust album and it will sound like Gorelust. This is the point of doing this.\nPeoples who loves the first album wants to hear a second album and we\u2019ll give them what they want! Brutal death metal music. The goal is to push the brutality and technicality.Everything\nneeds to be better, and we\u2019ll see to that. So we will stick to the roots but we also want to upgrade the product. We don\u2019t want to only use the name of the band, the music has to be the logical\nsequel of the Reign of Lunacy album.\n\n.What are your personal thoughts on Metal sub-genres especially on Metal core and Djent?\n-I\u2019ll be very honest with you on your next questions.:-)\nI actually don\u2019t know what Djent is and I don\u2019t listen to metal core at all. So I can\u2019t really give\nyou any personal thoughts on them. I\u2019m almost 36 years old right now and I\u2019ve listened to metal\nsince I was 6-7 but I\u2019m pretty picky about what I like or not. I also don\u2019t really care for the\ndifferent terms of the differents category of metal. For me great music is great music. It\u2019s all a\nmatter of tastes.What about the more extreme form of Metal like Goregrind,pornogrind etc?\n-Just like I said terms are not important for me. Too much category and its all get\nconfusing. I don\u2019t know why peoples want to categorize everything\u2026 \ud83d\ude42 I prefer to say brutal\nmusic. Death metal or black metal. But pornogrind\u2026.I can\u2019t say\u2026. \ud83d\ude42\n\n.Do you think Death Metal as a genre is still \u2018Underground\u2019?\n-Yes, completely. It will always be. Mainstream is what the the majority of the peoples\nare listening and death metal is definitely not that.\n\n.Well again I would like to thank you for your time. We at DSU and BRUTAL POKHARA wish theband all the best for \u2018Reign in Lunacy\u2019 and the upcoming releases. Any last shout outs?\n-Thanks a lot for this nice interview.I also want to say a big thank you to everyone who is\nreading this. Thanks for your support. Don\u2019t forget to \u201clikes\u201d the Gorelust offical facebook page\nor the group page and you\u2019ll hear from us. Any news on the new release will be post there. We\ncan\u2019t wait to give you the next Gorelust chapter. Stay brutal! Cheers from Canada."
