R. Crim P. 33. He asserts that the District Court made numerous errors\n\nby rejecting his motion premised on a claim of newly discovered evidence. We will\n\naffirm the District Court\u2019s judgment of conviction and sentence.\n\n       This opinion does not have any precedential value. Therefore our discussion of\n\nthe case is limited to covering only what is necessary to explain our decision to the\n\nparties.\n\n       In 2005, Munchak, a Commissioner for Lackawana County, Pennsylvania, joined\n\na fellow commissioner in demanding payments of monies from Highland Associates, an\n\narchitectural and engineering firm that was doing work for the County. The partners of\n\nHighland\u2014Don Kalina, Dom Provini, and Kevin Smith\u2014agreed to pay the demand of\n\n$30,000\u2014each contributing $10,000\u2014as well as two additional demands of the same\n\namount over the next six months.\n\n           The Government conducted an investigation and indicted Munchak and a fellow\n\nCommissioner on numerous charges arising from Highland\u2019s payments to the\n\nCommissioners. A jury convicted Munchak on June 21, 2011, of conspiracy to commit\n\ntheft or bribery concerning programs receiving federal funds (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371); two\n\ncounts of theft or bribery concerning programs receiving federal funds (18 U.S.C. \u00a7\n\n666(a)(1)(B)); conspiracy to commit extortion under color of right (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a));\n\ntwo counts of extortion under color of right (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a)); filing a false tax return\n\n                                             2\n\f(26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7206(1)); and, attempted income tax evasion (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7201). The\n\nDistrict Court sentenced Munchak to 84 months of imprisonment.1\n\n       In January 2014, Munchak filed a Rule 33 motion for new trial, on the basis of\n\nnewly discovered evidence that, he says, proves Smith, Provini and Kalina lied about the\n\namount the County owed Highland.2 At Munchak\u2019s trial, the partners were questioned\n\nabout why they paid the extortion rather than report it to the authorities. Smith said they\n\nfeared any such report would become \u201cour word against their word,\u201d putting their work\n\nwith the county in jeopardy. J.A. 97. He said that,\n\n                     [I]t was kind of an interesting time for the request to\n                     come, and I think at that time I think we were owed\n                     1.3 million dollars fees. We had probably 40 percent of\n                     the people in the Clarks Summit office were working\n                     on county contracts that were cancelable at any time.\n\nJ.A. 95. He went on to say that, with their large payroll and overhead, they felt\n\nparticularly vulnerable to negative cash flow consequences if the County began to slow\n\nits payments, or cancel the contract. After the third payment, Smith noted that they were\n\n\u201cheading down on some of these contracts, but we were still \u2013we had a lot of money out\n\nthere.\u201d J.A. 103.\n\n       Provini was also questioned about their decision to pay money to the\n\nCommissioners. He said:\n\n\n1\n We affirmed the conviction on appeal. United States v. Munchak, 527 Fed. App\u2019x. 191\n(3d Cir. 2013).\n2\n  The District Court convicted a co-defendant, Robert Cardaro, and we affirmed it. He\njoined Munchak in the filing of the Rule 33 motion and appeal of the District Court\u2019s\ndecision, but he withdrew his appeal.\n                                             3\n\f                     A. \u201cWe reviewed alternatives. I happen to have the\n                     financials on my desk. I pretty much knew what the\n                     oldest, which was 1.2 or 1.3 million dollars.\n                     Q. Who owed you 1.2 or 1.3 million dollars?\n                     A. The county. At that particular time we were out\n                     that money. So that was all our cash out.\n\nJ.A. 146. He went on to say:\n\n                     We looked at the amount of manpower we had on the\n                     project, what would we do with that manpower if the\n                     project was stopped or delayed or slowed. And then it\n                     became a problem of trying to place that many people\n                     on work that we really didn't have a contract in other\n                     areas.\n\nJ.A. 149.\n\n       Finally, Kalina said the following: \u201c[A]t that time we had a significant amount of\n\nlabor expended into the projects that we were working on. It was approximately 1.3\n\nmillion dollars, in that area, that the county owed us.\u201d J.A. 198. He said in another part\n\nof his testimony: \u201cWe had 1.3 million dollars of money that was due to us as we\n\nprogressed forward with the work.\u201d J.A. 214. He also testified: \u201cWe just [had] too\n\nmuch to lose. If we lose these contracts we can\u2019t afford it, we\u2019d be losing people, we\u2019d\n\nbe laying people off, and there\u2019s too many families involved.\u201d J.A. 199. He noted that,\n\nat the time of their last payment, \u201cWe did collect some money. Excuse me. Our\n\nreceivables was still rather high in November of \u201905.\u201d J.A. 208.\n\n       In his motion for new trial, Munchak focuses on one exchange between the\n\nprosecutor and Smith during trial.\n\n                     Q. When you say there were 1.3 million invoices\n                     outstanding, who were those invoices with?\n                     A. They were with the county.\n\n                                             4\n\fJ.A. 96. Munchak is convinced that this is an assertion by Smith that Highland had\n\nalready submitted invoices to the County at that time, in that amount. His motion is an\n\nattempt to proffer \u201cnew evidence\u201d that he says refutes this claim.\n\n       In support of his argument that Smith, Kalina and Provini lied about the amount of\n\nmoney the County owed Highland, Munchak produces a statement by Thomas Durkin,\n\nCounty Chief Financial Officer, attesting that there was no outstanding invoice from\n\nHighland in mid-May 2005 in the amount of $1.3 million.3 He also proffers a chart from\n\na trade journal reporting that Highland Associates had $23.8 million in revenue for 2005.\n\nThis, Munchak asserts, demonstrates an exaggerated or false claim by Smith, Provini and\n\nKalina that the loss of the County\u2019s contract would have produced dire consequences for\n\nthe firm.4\n\n       Motions for a new trial \u201care not favored and should \u2018be granted sparingly and only\n\nin exceptional cases.\u2019\u201d United States v. Silveus, 542 F.3d 993, 1005 (3d Cir. 2008)\n\n(quoting Gov\u2019t of the V.I v. Derricks, 810 F.2d 50, 55 (3d Cir. 1987)). We, first, conclude\n\nthat the District Court did not err by relying upon a five-factor test to assess the motion:\n\n3\n  \u201cAt no time during that period [August 20, 2004, through July 25, 2005] did the County\nowe $1.3 million to Highland Associates. . . . In mid-May 2005, only three invoices from\nHighland Associates to the County were unpaid, resulting in an outstanding balance of\n$95,807.32. Highland later submitted to the County a $64,511.97 invoice for the period\nending March 25, 2005, but Highland did not submit that invoice until October 2005.\u201d\nJ.A. 320.\n4\n  In a second statement, Durkin states: \u201cI do not know the total amount of receivables\nfrom the County Highland was carrying on their books in mid-May 2005. . . .\u201d He goes\non to say: \u201cHighland submitted invoices totaling $681,546.76 on May 27, 2005. The\nfollowing month, Highland submitted invoices totaling $536,544.11.\u201d J.A. 338.\n\n                                              5\n\f               (a) the evidence must be in fact, newly discovered, i.e.,\n               discovered since the trial; (b) facts must be alleged from\n               which the court may infer diligence on the part of the movant;\n               (c) the evidence relied on, must not be merely cumulative or\n               impeaching; (d) it must be material to the issues involved;\n               and (e) it must be such, and of such nature, as that, on a new\n               trial, the newly discovered evidence would probably produce\n               an acquittal.\n\nUnited States v. Cimera, 459 F.3d 452, 458 (3d Cir. 2006) (quoting United States v.\n\nIannelli, 528 F.2d 1290, 1292 (3d Cir. 1976)). Moreover, we conclude that the District\n\nCourt\u2019s analysis of the evidence presented by Munchak was well within its discretion.\n\n         Even if we ignore Munchak\u2019s dubious assertion of diligence regarding the\n\nevidence he proffers,5 he has a problem. The District Court correctly concluded that\n\nMunchak\u2019s motion does not expose false testimony. The evidence he proffers\u2014Durkin\u2019s\n\nstatement\u2014is completely undermined by the clarification Durkin gave to the Prosecution.\n\nAs Durkin\u2019s later statement makes evident, Highland was billing the County for large\n\nsums of money throughout that period of time. This is completely consistent with the\n\npartners\u2019 testimony that, due to the large amount of work they were doing for the County\n\nin that period of time, they feared the business consequences of reporting Munchak to the\n\nauthorities. We would have to ignore the larger context provided in Durkin\u2019s subsequent\n\nstatement to attach any significance to Munchak\u2019s evidence that on one particular date,\n\nHighland had not invoiced the County for precisely $1.3 million.\n\n         Likewise, a vague reference to 2005 revenues listed in one trade journal chart,\n\nlisting revenue numbers of unknown provenance, is insufficient to help his cause. Even\n\n5\n    We by no means imply that the record supports Munchak\u2019s diligence.\n\n                                              6\n\fif we assume that the number is accurate, Munchak does not give us anything beyond\n\nconclusory statements to enable us to understand how it discredits the partners\u2019\n\ntestimony. A revenue figure, without more, does not satisfy his burden to substantiate his\n\nargument that the partners gave false testimony. None of this, as Munchak claims:\n\n\u201cdramatically weaken[s] the partners\u2019 claim that they acceded to the demand for cash out\n\nof fear.\u201d Appellant Brief, p. 45.\n\n       Ultimately, Munchak was required not just to convince us that the witnesses\u2019\n\ntestimony is not credible, but rather to make the case that evidence of their false\n\ntestimony creates a reasonable probability of a different outcome at trial. 6 Since, as the\n\nDistrict Court correctly concluded, his \u201cnew evidence\u201d does not discredit the partners\u2019\n\ntestimony, it is impossible to conclude that it creates a reasonable likelihood (or, indeed,\n\nany rational chance) of a different outcome by the jury. This conclusion proves fatal to\n\nhis claim, no matter how it is framed.\n\n       Under a due process review, \u201ca conviction obtained by the knowing use of\n\nperjured testimony is fundamentally unfair, and must be set aside if there is any\n\nreasonable likelihood that the false testimony could have affected the judgment of the\n\njury.\u201d See United States v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97, 103 (1976). A new trial grounded in\n\nnewly discovered evidence requires the party to show the evidence is \u201cof such nature, as\n\nthat, on a new trial, the newly discovered evidence would probably produce an acquittal.\u201d\n\nUnited States v. Adams, 759 F.2d 1099, 1108 (3d Cir. 1985) (quoting Iannelli, 528 F.2d\n\n6\n Because of this, Munchak would have failed on this element even if the Larrison test\nhad been used. United States v. Massac, 867 F.2d 174, 178 (3d Cir. 1989).\n\n                                              7\n\fat 1292). A Brady violation occurs when material evidence favorable to the defense is\n\nsuppressed. Simmons v. Beard, 590 F.3d 223, 234 (3d Cir. 2009). \u201cEvidence is\n\n\u2018material\u2019 where \u2018there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed\n\nto the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting\n\nUnited States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 682 (1985)). Munchak fails to meet his\n\nevidentiary burden on any of these. Because of this, we conclude that the District Court\n\ndid not err by denying the motion.\n\n       For all of these reasons, we will affirm the order of the District Court.\n\n\n\n\n                                              8\n\f"
