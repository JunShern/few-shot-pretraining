    "text": "England manager Gareth Southgate has been told his job is safe even if his side lose all their group matches at next year\u2019s World Cup in Russia.\n\nSouthgate took the reins on a permanent basis 12 months ago on a four-year contract and oversaw a successful qualification for the 2018 showpiece event, where England will face Belgium, Tunisia and Panama in the group stage.\n\nFootball Association chief executive Martin Glenn said he would retain faith that England have the right man at the helm \u2014 \u201cfor the next few tournaments\u201d \u2014 regardless of results in Russia.\n\n\u201cGareth has a long-term contract. We\u2019ve got a long-term plan. You\u2019ve seen it, you\u2019ve seen some of the fruits of it,\u201d said Glenn, quoted in the English press on Monday.\n\n\u201cLong-term plans are hard to defend when the short-term results go against you.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not looking at Russia as a free pass. The World Cup\u2019s a really important staging post for our development, I think.\u201d\n\nEngland, who are 15th in the FIFA world rankings, failed to qualify for the knockout stages in Brazil in 2014.\n\n\u201cWe go out there wanting to win it but also being realistic,\u201d said Glenn. \u201cNo-one wants to have a bad World Cup but we\u2019re confident he\u2019s the right guy to take us through for the next few tournaments.\u201d\n\nEngland\u2019s future hopes have been buoyed by recent age-group successes, including Under-17 and Under-20 World Cup victories, and Glenn believes showing long-term vision is the way forward.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to do it in a way that\u2019s sustainable,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019re going to make sure that we\u2019re picking the kind of players that can do their best in Russia and continue to kick on in 2020 and 2022.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is making sure that players that have made it through to the first team by 21, 22, have had lots and lots of tournament experience. So those under-17 winners and under-20 winners will be coming through and they are serious competitions to win.\n\n\u201cWe know that worked for the Germans and we know that worked for the Spanish, so we\u2019re just repeating things they\u2019ve done with our own emphasis on it.\u201d"
