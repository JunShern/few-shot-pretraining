Then welcome to the first episode of our own Hearthstone Quiz! Each episode is going to feature 9 questions divided into 3 categories \u2013 Easy, Medium [\u2026]\n\nList of Episodes\n\nIntroduction\n\nHave you ever wanted to test your Hearthstone knowledge? Do you think you know everything about the cards, interactions and maybe even flavor texts? Then welcome to the first episode of our own Hearthstone Quiz!\n\nEach episode is going to feature 9 questions divided into 3 categories \u2013 Easy, Medium and Hard. It\u2019s not perfect, because question difficulty might be subjective, but we hope that everyone finds some challenges when doing the Quiz.\n\nWhen it comes to the scoring, you can calculate your own points if you want. It\u2019s not necessary, but if you want to see your score and compare it to other people, here is the deal. Easy questions are worth 2 points, Medium questions 3 points and Hard questions 4 points each! It means that in total, you can score up to 27 points. If the question has more than one part, you need to answer everything correctly to get points.\n\nWe\u2019ve also asked some of our pro players to answer the questions, so you can you can compare your answers with theirs. This episode features Hoarth and Kabi.\n\nLet\u2019s start with Hearthstone Quiz #1!\n\nDifficulty: Easy\n\nQuestion 1. What happens when you use crazed-alchemist crazed-alchemist doomsayer doomsayer\n\n[spoiler title=\u201dAnswer to Question 1\u2033]\n\nHoarth: It dies.\n\nKabi: Dies unless there is a passive buff aura that would give him an extra life as it gets swapped, like the old blood-imp.\n\nAnswer: Since you change the minion\u2019s health to 0, it instantly dies.[/spoiler]\n\nQuestion 2. When you Silence the ancient-of-war ancient-of-war druid-of-the-claw druid-of-the-claw\n\n[spoiler]\n\nHoarth: It becomes a 4/6, non taunted.\n\nKabi: Stays the same minus Taunt, as it is not a buff, but a card replacement.\n\nAnswer: When it comes to the Ancient of War, the +5 Attack or Health is considered a buff, thus it goes away when Silenced. With Druid of the Claw, both forms are different minions, not buffs. The Bear Form is a 4/6 minion with Taunt, so it stays a 4/6 and only the Taunt gets removed.[/spoiler]\n\nQuestion 3. If a minion that already attacked this turn is given Windfury (for example by windspeaker windspeaker enhance-o-mechano enhance-o-mechano\n\n[spoiler]\n\nHoarth: Yes.\n\nKabi: Yes.\n\nAnswer: Yes, it can. [/spoiler]\n\nDifficulty: Medium\n\nQuestion 4. Is there a minion that can attack more than 2 times per turn?\n\n[spoiler title=\u201dAnswer to Question 4\u2033]\n\nHoarth: Yes \u2013 V-07-TR-0N.\n\nKabi: Voltron.\n\nAnswer: When it comes to collectible minions, there is none. But if you meet the conditions on mimirons-head, at the start of your next turn you spawn v-07-tr-0n \u2013 a minion with Mega-Windfury. He is able to attack 4 times per turn. [/spoiler]\n\nQuestion 5. Does Spell Power (on Paladin\u2019s side) affect damage dealt by the eye-for-an-eye eye-for-an-eye\n\n[spoiler title=\u201dAnswer to Question 5\u2033]\n\nHoarth: No.\n\nKabi: Yes, damage Secrets are affected by Spell Power. For example, explosive-trap does 3 damage if you have a bloodmage-thalnos in play.\n\nAnswer: Since the Secrets are considered Spells, their damage is affected by the Spell Power. What\u2019s worth noting is that the Spell Power bonuses are counted when the Secret is procced, not when it\u2019s used.[/spoiler]\n\nQuestion 6. Under what conditions a minion with Stealth gets unstealthed \u2013 when it receives damage, deals damage or both?\n\n[spoiler title=\u201dAnswer to Question 6\u2033]\n\nHoarth: Deals damage.\n\nKabi: Minions do not get unstealthed when they take damage, they get unstealthed when they do damage.\n\nAnswer: Minions only lose Stealth once they deal damage to something: by attacking it, by being attacked and hitting it back (e.g. by ogre-brute missing the original target and attacking minion in Stealth) or by their effects. Popping a Divine Shield is also considered as dealing damage. So, for example, if you holy-nova enemy stranglethorn-tiger, it stays in Stealth. But if you Stealth your knife-juggler and play another minion, activating the card\u2019s ability, Knife Juggler gets out of Stealth because he has dealt damage with its effect.[/spoiler]\n\nDifficulty: Hard\n\nQuestion 7. Both you and your enemy are at 1 health with an empty board. You\u2019re out of cards in the deck and will take fatigue damage with next card draw. You drop knife-juggler knife-juggler novice-engineer novice-engineer\n\n[spoiler]\n\nHoarth: It is a tie.\n\nKabi: It\u2019s a draw, the juggle will resolve, but so will the Battlecry.\n\nAnswer: Both of the actions are triggered when you play a minion \u2013 Novice Engineer. It means that minion completely resolves only after both the juggle (dealing 1 damage to enemy) and card draw (taking fatigue damage). By the time the minion is resolved, you and your enemy are dead, so the game ends in a draw, meaning that no one wins it.[/spoiler]\n\nQuestion 8. When Warrior attacks a minion with a 1/1 gorehowl gorehowl\n\n[spoiler title=\u201dAnswer to Question 8\u2033]\n\nHoarth: It becomes a 0/1, and the Warrior can attack with it again only if he uses something like captain-greenskin.\n\nKabi: It becomes a 0/1, can\u2019t attack.\n\nAnswer: The weapon becomes 0/1, just as the Gorehowl effect states (attack gets reduced by 1). You can\u2019t attack with characters that have 0 attack (minions, Heroes), so the Warrior is unable to attack with it. Only if the weapon gets replaced or the attack gets buffed, the Warrior can attack again. It still, however, counts for the sake of effects that require you to have an equipped weapon \u2013 like southsea-deckhand\u2018s Charge. [/spoiler]\n\nQuestion 9. Priest steals enemy Warlock\u2019s minion with shadow-madness shadow-madness power-overwhelming power-overwhelming\n\n[spoiler]\n\nHoarth: It dies.\n\nKabi: Dies, it says \u201cat the end of the turn\u201d not \u201cyour turn\u201d.\n\nAnswer: Blizzard never confirmed whether it\u2019s a bug or intended behavior, but the minion actually doesn\u2019t die. \u201cEnd of turn\u201d in card\u2019s text means \u201cend of owner\u2019s turn\u201d in this context. Priest used Shadow Madness on a minion, then Power Overwhelming. \u201cEnd of the turn\u201d effects are resolved in the order which they were used. It means that Shadow Madness is resolved first, returning the minion to Warlock. Then, Power Overwhelming doesn\u2019t kill the minion, because the current owner is Warlock, and it\u2019s not the end of his turn yet. Warlock can still attack with the minion one time and only at the end of his turn the minion dies.\n\nEDIT\n\nAs it has been found out recently, the outcome depends on whether you are the dominant player or not. I\u2019ve never heard of this before, even though I\u2019ve been reading about the in-game interactions a lot, thus the confusion around the question. You can find out more by watching this video.[/spoiler]\n\nScoring\n\nOur pro team did pretty well in this episode. The only question that was tough for them was Question 9. But since the interaction might be bugged, making a mistake is understandable. The final score looks as follows:\n\nClosing\n\nThat\u2019s it for the first episode of Hearthstone Quiz. I encourage you to share your scores, questions and ideas in the comment section below \ud83d\ude42\n\nIf you have any ideas for questions we can use in future, hit me up at stonekeephs@gmail.com and if they aren\u2019t on my list already, I\u2019ll be sure to add them in future, giving you a credit for coming up with a question."
