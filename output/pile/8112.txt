    "text": "WASHINGTON - Political acrimony over President Donald Trump\u2019s controversial decision to fire FBI Director James Comey is playing into the hands of a longtime U.S. adversary, several current and former U.S. intelligence officials say.\n\n\u201cFrom a geopolitical standpoint, the real winner is Russia,\u201d said Luke Hartig, a former senior director at the National Security Council under former President Barack Obama.\n\n'Could Russia want anything more?'\n\nJeffrey Ringel, a recently retired 21-year veteran of the FBI now serving as director of The Soufan Group, echoed similar sentiments about how the current political dynamic is playing out.\n\n\u201cCould Russia want anything more?\u201d Ringel asked of Comey\u2019s sudden dismissal. \u201cRussia is probably very happy with the results of this action because this action is going to bog down the [FBI\u2019s] investigation.\u201d\n\nTrump said he fired Comey because \u201che wasn\u2019t doing a good job.\u201d\n\nA memo from the Justice Department criticized Comey\u2019s handling of the investigation of whether former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton mishandled classified material.\n\nDemocrats and some Republicans see the FBI\u2019s investigation into Russia\u2019s ties to the Trump campaign as the real reason Comey was fired.\n\nAdding fuel to the controversy was Wednesday\u2019s meeting between Trump and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, one day after Comey was fired. The White House did not let the media into the meeting for a customary photo opportunity. The only pictures of the meeting came from the Russian Foreign Ministry.\n\nBefore meeting with Trump, Lavrov, at the State Department, made light of Comey\u2019s departure, joking with American reporters who asked whether his dismissal cast a shadow over the foreign minister\u2019s visit.\n\n\"Was he fired?\" Lavrov coyly asked them at the first mention of Comey. \"You are kidding. You are kidding.\"\n\nDenied collusion allegations\n\nWhile continuing to deny that members of the Trump campaign colluded with Russia, White House officials maintained Wednesday that Comey\u2019s firing would have no impact on the FBI investigation.\n\nStill, there are those who worry that no matter how the investigation plays out, it could be advantage Russia.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to exploit whatever cultural fissures there are within a country,\u201d a U.S. official told VOA on condition of anonymity when asked about Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s evolving strategy for the U.S. and its allies.\n\n\u201cThe intensity is new. Some of the tools are new,\u201d the official added. The pattern, however, is not.\n\n\u201cHe will do anything to fracture traditional alliances that he sees as threatening to his power,\u201d the official said.\n\nAnd there are fears that every victory, no matter how slight, will only further embolden Putin and Russia.\n\nRussian-linked hackers\n\nAlready, the U.S. National Security Agency has accused Russian-linked hackers of trying to sow confusion in France during its recent presidential election.\n\nAnd NSA Director Adm. Michael Rogers noted Tuesday that the U.S. was seeing \u201csimilar things\u201d in Britain and Germany.\n\n\u201cThe first objective was to sow discord and dissension, which they certainly did,\u201d former U.S. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told a Senate panel Monday, when asked about Russian interference in the U.S. presidential elections.\n\n\u201cThey're going to continue to do it,\u201d Clapper added. \u201cAnd why not? It proved successful.\u201d"
