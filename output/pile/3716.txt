    "text": "Pic: Tim Ireland/PA Wire/Press Association Images\n\nHEALTH MINISTER JAMES Reilly has asked his department to examine research around electronic cigarettes because he is not convinced that they are a safe product.\n\nReilly said earlier today that e-cigarettes are not harmless and because they contain nicotine they can have addictive and cardio-vascular effects.\n\nE-cigarettes are battery-operated products that turn nicotine into a vapor inhaled by the user.\n\n\u201cI am not convinced of [their] safety,\u201d Reilly told the media earlier today. \u201cI don\u2019t like the idea that they are being promoted, particularly on flights. I don\u2019t like that.\u201d\n\nLast week, the British regulatory authority said it was to control the sale of such products by classifying them as medicines and making them available over-the-counter.\n\nThere are no regulations controlling the sale or advertising of e-cigarettes in Ireland. They are widely available in some shops and online but not in pharmacies following the advice of the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland.\n\nReilly added: \u201cThey might be safer than regular tobacco insofar as they don\u2019t have all the other toxins in them but they still, I believe, are not safe. But I want to be on evidence-based ground when I make any possible decision in relation to them.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the minister also said today that it was his intention to ensure that all hospitals in Ireland are smoke-free by the end of the year both inside buildings and on the grounds of the health facilities.\n\nAsked about the possibility of making the grounds of Leinster House smoke-free, Reilly said it was not his decision.\n\n\u201cLeinster House is something I can raise at the Cabinet but it is not within my gift to dictate that particular situation,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I would agree that Leinster House ought to go that way and show leadership.\u201d"
