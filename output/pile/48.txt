Ark. Code\nAnn. \u00a7 6-18-702(a).2 The district courts3 held that the statute's religious beliefs\n\n\n      1\n       The Honorable David R. Hansen stepped down as Chief Judge of the United\nStates Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit at the close of business on March 31,\n2003. He has been succeeded by the Honorable James B. Loken.\n      2\n       Ark. Code Ann. \u00a7 6-18-702 (2002), as in effect at the time of the district\ncourts\u2019 decisions, provided:\n\n      (a) Except as otherwise provided by law, no infant or child shall be\n      admitted to a public or private school or child care facility of this state\n      who has not been age appropriately immunized from poliomyelitis,\n      diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, red (rubeola) measles, rubella, and other\n      diseases as designated by the State Board of Health, as evidenced by a\n      certificate of a licensed physician or a public health department\n      acknowledging the immunization.\n      ....\n      (d)(2) The provisions of this section shall not apply if the parents or\n      legal guardian of that child object thereto on the grounds that\n\n                                         -4-\n\fexemption violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment because the\nexemption applied only to the \u201creligious tenets and practices of a recognized church\nor religious denomination.\u201d Ark. Code Ann. \u00a7 6-18-702(d)(2) (2000) (emphasis\nadded). The district courts then determined that the exemption was severable from\nthe remainder of the statute. Construing the statute without the exemption, the district\ncourts held that the underlying immunization requirement survived Due Process,\nEqual Protection, Free-Exercise, and Hybrid Rights challenges. On appeal, we do not\nreach the merits of the claims raised below because the Arkansas legislature rendered\nthese issues moot when it broadened the exemption to encompass philosophical as\nwell as religious objections. See Ark. Code Ann. \u00a7 6-18-702(d)(4)(A) (2003).\nInstead, we set forth the general history of these matters, explain the changes in\nArkansas law, and address the issue of mootness as discussed by the parties in their\nsupplemental, post-argument briefs.\n\n                                     I. Background\n\n       Because the issues in this case do not turn on the specific facts that differentiate\neach individual party, we forgo a detailed discussion of the individual parties and the\nspecific facts that gave rise to their actions. Instead, we describe the parties generally\n\n\n\n      immunization conflicts with the religious tenets and practices of a\n      recognized church or religious denomination of which the parent or\n      guardian is an adherent or member.\n\n(Emphasis added). The State Board of Health, in cooperation with the Board of\nEducation, on July 27, 2000, promulgated regulations that listed Hepatitis B as one\nof the designated diseases under Ark. Code Ann. \u00a7 6-18-702(a).\n      3\n      The Honorable Robert T. Dawson, United States District Judge for the\nWestern District of Arkansas (Case No. 02-3035), and the Honorable Susan Webber\nWright, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas (Case Nos.\n02-3094, 02-3104, and 02-3195).\n\n                                           -5-\n\fby their respective roles. The first group of parties consists of Arkansas\nschoolchildren who were excluded from school or threatened with exclusion from\nschool for failure to receive immunization treatments for Hepatitis B. This group also\nincludes the parents of the schoolchildren (collectively, the \u201cSchoolchildren\u201d). The\nsecond group consists of the Arkansas Departments of Health and Education and\nvarious officials from these two departments, including Fay W. Boozman, the\nDirector of the Arkansas Department of Health (collectively, the \u201cOfficials\u201d). The\nfinal group consists of various individual Arkansas school districts (collectively, the\n\u201cSchool Districts\u201d). In each case, the Schoolchildren brought suit against the School\nDistricts and/or the Officials.\n\n       The Schoolchildren in each case alleged that they held sincere religious beliefs\nthat prevented each child from being immunized for Hepatitis B. The Schoolchildren\ndid not belong to any recognized religion that had as one of its tenets opposition to\nimmunization for Hepatitis B. We, like the district courts, assume for the purposes\nof our analysis that the Schoolchildren held sincere religious beliefs against Hepatitis\nB vaccination.\n\n       In Case No. 02-3035 the Schoolchildren argued that the religious beliefs\nexemption violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment by permitting\nexemptions only for beliefs associated with a recognized religion. They also argued\nthat the underlying immunization requirement violated their Equal Protection and\nDue Process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. The district court accepted the\nSchoolchildren's arguments regarding the Establishment Clause challenge, but held\nthe religious beliefs exemption severable. The district court then rejected the\nSchoolchildren\u2019s Equal Protection and Due Process challenges to the underlying\nimmunization requirement, finding that the Supreme Court had repeatedly ruled such\nrequirements permissible. See Zucht v. King, 260 U.S. 174, 176-77 (1922); Jacobson\nv. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11, 27-29 (1905). Accordingly, the district court\npreserved the immunization requirement but severed the exemption.\n\n                                          -6-\n\f       Noting the hollow nature of the Schoolchildren's victory, the district court\nstated:\n\n      Our holding does not afford relief of any real value to the Plaintiff\n      because his daughter remains subject to receiving the required shots as\n      a condition of attending school within the state of Arkansas. This\n      decision will also be of understandable concern to those who previously\n      enjoyed the immunization exemption as adherents or members of a\n      recognized church or religious denomination. However, the recourse of\n      both groups is to communicate their concerns to the Arkansas\n      Legislature, for it is within the province of the legislature and not this\n      Court to enact a religious exemption provision that comes within\n      constitutional boundaries.\n\n       In Case No. 02-3104, the Schoolchildren brought suit against the Officials and\nSchool Districts. The district court adopted the analysis of the earlier opinion and,\nin addition, set forth a separate analysis to conclude that the religious beliefs\nexemption was unconstitutional and severable. The district court rejected the\nSchoolchildren's argument that the First Amendment\u2019s Free Exercise Clause\ndemanded a compelling interest analysis of the compulsory immunization\nrequirement. Instead, the district court found that the statute was a neutral statute of\ngeneral applicability that did not target religious beliefs. The district court also\nrejected the argument that other constitutional rights, such as, inter alia, a parent's\nright to control a child's education, reinforced the underlying Free Exercise Rights\nchallenge and mandated the application of compelling interest review under a Hybrid\nRights analysis. See, e.g., Employment Div., Oregon Dep\u2019t of Human Res. v. Smith,\n494 U.S. 872, 881 (1990) (discussing the application of compelling interest review\nin cases that involve alleged First Amendment violations in combination with other\nalleged constitutional violations). Finally, the district court rejected a Substantive\nDue Process challenge under the Fourteenth Amendment in which the Schoolchildren\nalleged that the right to refuse medical treatment was a fundamental liberty interest\nthat mandated compelling interest review of the compulsory immunization statute.\n\n                                          -7-\n\f       In Case No. 02-3094, the Schoolchildren brought suit against the Officials and\nthe School Districts and argued issues similar to those described above. In addition,\nthe Schoolchildren argued that because the compulsory immunization statute\nprovided individualized exemptions for secular purposes, such as medical exigencies,\na general religious exemption was necessary to avoid a Free Exercise violation. The\ndistrict court rejected these arguments.\n\n       Finally, Case No. 02-3195 involves a cross-appeal from two of the School\nDistricts, the Morningstar and Lake Hamilton School Districts. The Morningstar and\nLake Hamilton School Districts moved for dismissal arguing that they were involved\nin no justiciable case or controversy with the Schoolchildren. Pointing to the fact that\nthe relevant Arkansas statutes and rules provide for criminal sanctions against school\nofficials who fail to enforce the immunization requirements, the Morningstar and\nLake Hamilton School Districts characterized themselves as disinterested bystanders\ncaught in the crossfire between the Schoolchildren and the Officials. See Ark. Code\nAnn. \u00a7 6-18-702(c)(2)(B) (2000) (\u201cAny school official, parent, or guardian violating\nthe regulations shall be subject to the penalties imposed herein.\u201d); Id. \u00a7 6-18-702(e)\n(2000) (\u201cany person found guilty of violating the provisions of this section or the\nregulations promulgated by the State Board of Education or the division for the\nenforcement hereof shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.\u201d). The district court rejected\nthe motion to dismiss, finding that the Lake Hamilton and Morningstar School\nDistricts were proper parties to the litigation.\n\n       After obtaining jurisdiction, we entered a temporary stay to permit the non-\nimmunized Schoolchildren to attend school pending resolution of their appeals. After\noral arguments, we noted that the Schoolchildren had followed the district court\u2019s\nsuggestion and communicated their concerns to the Arkansas legislature. As a result,\nthe Arkansas legislature had amended the exemption portion of the statute to omit\nreference to \u201crecognized\u201d religions and to provide broader exemptions based on\n\n                                          -8-\n\f\u201creligious or philosophical beliefs.\u201d Id. \u00a7 6-18-702 (d)(4)(A) (2003).4 It appeared,\n\n      4\n          Ark. Code Ann. \u00a7 6-18-702 (d)(4) provides:\n\n      (A) The provisions of this section shall not apply if the parents or legal\n      guardian of that child object thereto on the grounds that immunization\n      conflicts with the religious or philosophical beliefs of the parent or\n      guardian.\n\n      (B) The parents or legal guardian of the child shall complete an annual\n      application process developed in the rules and regulations of the\n      Department of Health for medical, religious, and philosophical\n      exemptions.\n\n      (C) The rules and regulations developed by the Department of Health for\n      medical, religious, and philosophical exemptions shall include, but not\n      be limited to:\n\n           (i) A notarized statement requesting a religious, philosophical, or\n           medical exemption from the Department of Health by the parents or\n           legal guardian of the child regarding the objection;\n\n           (ii) Completion of an educational component developed by the\n           Department of Health that includes information on the risks and\n           benefits of vaccination;\n\n           (iii) An informed consent from the parents or guardian that shall\n           include a signed statement of refusal to vaccinate based on the\n           Department of Health\u2019s refusal-to-vaccinate form; and\n\n           (iv) A signed statement of understanding that:\n\n               (a) At the discretion of the Department of Health, the\n               unimmunized child or individual may be removed from day care\n               or school during an outbreak if the child or individual is not fully\n               vaccinated; and\n\n\n                                            -9-\n\fhowever, that the broadened exemption was not yet in force because the Arkansas\nDepartment of Health had not passed necessary implementing regulations and the\namended statute specifically prohibited the granting of exemptions prior to passage\nof the implementing regulations. See Id. \u00a7 6-18-702 (d)(4)(D). Accordingly, it was\nnot clear whether any Schoolchildren would be excluded from school in the absence\nof our temporary stay.\n\n        We directed the parties to submit supplemental briefs to address whether the\nanticipated availability of a broadened exemption mooted the underlying challenges\nto the immunization requirement. Subsequently, the Arkansas Department of Health\npassed the necessary implementing regulations.5 No claims under the newly amended\nexemption are before the court at this time, and no Schoolchildren claim to have been\n\n\n             (b) The child or individual shall not return to school until the\n             outbreak has been resolved and the Department of Health\n             approves the return to school.\n\n      (D) No exemptions may be granted under this subdivision (d)(4) until\n      the application process has been implemented by the Department of\n      Health and completed by the applicant.\n      5\n       Rules and Regulations Pertaining to Immunization Requirements, \u00a7 IV(A), (C)\nand (D), slip at 4-5, at http://www.healthyarkansas.com/rules_regs/immunization\n_requirements_2003.pdf (promulgated in part under the authority of Ark. Code Ann.\n\u00a7 6-18-702, signed by Governor Mike Huckabee on July 31, 2003). The relevant\nprovisions of the new exemption requirement require religious and philosophical\nobjectors to complete an annual application, sign a notorized statement claiming\nconflict with religious or philosophical beliefs, complete an educational component\nregarding the risks and benefits of vaccination, and sign a statement of informed\nconsent for the exclusion of a non-immunized child from school in the event of an\noutbreak.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fdenied the benefit of the new exemption under the amended statute and the new,\nimplementing regulations.\n\n                                    II. Analysis\n\n       We first address the basic question of any mootness analysis: whether the\nplaintiffs still hold a personal interest in the outcome of the action or whether\nchanged circumstances already provide the requested relief and eliminate the need for\ncourt action. Next we address exceptions to the mootness doctrine, namely, whether\nthe controversy of the present cases is one that is likely to recur but evades review\nand whether the Arkansas legislature\u2019s amendment of the statute is merely a voluntary\ncessation of challenged conduct that is insufficient to protect the Schoolchildren on\nan ongoing basis. Finally, we do not address the Schoolchildren\u2019s newly raised\nchallenges to certain procedural requirements of the new statute and regulations\nbecause such challenges are not ripe for review.\n\n                                   A. Mootness\n\n       \u201cUnder Article III of the Constitution, federal courts \u2018may adjudicate only\nactual, ongoing cases or controversies.\u2019\u201d National Right to Life Political Action\nComm. v. Connor, 323 F.3d 684, 689 (8th Cir. 2003) (quoting Lewis v. Continental\nBank Corp., 494 U.S. 472, 477 (1990)). Various doctrines, including the doctrine of\nmootness, provide the tools used to determine whether a plaintiff presents a\njusticiable case or controversy. Our court has stated:\n\n      The Supreme Court has repeatedly described the mootness doctrine as\n      \u201cthe doctrine of standing set in a time frame: The requisite personal\n      interest that must exist at the commencement of the litigation (standing)\n      must continue throughout its existence (mootness).\u201d Friends of the\n      Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., 538 U.S. 167, 189\n      (2000) (citations omitted). Thus, \u201c[w]e do not have jurisdiction over\n\n                                        -11-\n\f      cases in which \u2018due to the passage of time or a change in circumstances,\n      the issues presented . . . will no longer be \u2018live\u2019 or the parties will no\n      longer have a legally cognizable interest in the outcome of the\n      litigation.\u2019\u201d Van Bergen v. Minnesota, 59 F.3d 1541, 1546 (8th Cir.\n      1995) (quoting Arkansas AFL-CIO v. FCC, 11 F.3d 1430, 1435 (8th\n      Cir. 1993) (en banc)).\n\nNational Right to Life Political Action Comm., 323 F.3d at 691. The first question\nwe address, then, is whether the current litigation still presents to the Schoolchildren\nan opportunity for redress or whether the Schoolchildren have received the entirety\nof their requested relief from the Arkansas legislature and, therefore, no longer\npossess a personal interest in the litigation.\n\n        In each of the appealed cases, the Schoolchildren sought an exemption to allow\nthem to attend public school in Arkansas without receiving immunization against\nHepatitis B. Review of the amended immunization statute and its implementing\nregulations make clear that the statutory exemption now available to all the individual\nSchoolchildren provides precisely this relief. The Schoolchildren point to no other\nrelief that they requested in the lower courts. Instead, they argue that an exception\nto the mootness doctrine applies and that we must address the merits of their cases to\neliminate the risk that Arkansas might later repeal the newly enacted exemption\nprovision. Further, they argue that the new exemption provision itself is\nunconstitutional because it discriminates against religious objectors and imposes\nundue burdens through the exemption application process.6 These arguments,\nhowever, do not speak to the underlying issue of mootness. Looking, as we must, at\nthe relief requested and the scope of the relief made available by the Arkansas\n\n\n      6\n        The Schoolchildren also argued against mootness on the grounds that, at the\ntime of supplemental briefing, the implementing regulations were open for comment\nand, therefore, not yet effective. This argument, however, was transitory and became\nirrelevant on July 31, 2003 when the governor of Arkansas signed the implementing\nregulations.\n\n                                         -12-\n\flegislature, and finding no further relief that might be appropriate or available, it is\nclear that the Schoolchildren no longer present a live case or controversy. Their\nclaims are moot.\n\n                              B. Exceptions to Mootness\n\n       Notwithstanding this finding of mootness, we may still decide a case on its\nmerits if the controversy in the case is \u201ccapable of repetition yet evad[es] review.\u201d\nArkansas AFL-CIO v. F.C.C., 11 F.3d 1430, 1435 (8th Cir. 1993) (en banc). One\ncondition that must exist before this exception applies is \u201ca reasonable expectation\nthat the same complaining party will be subject to the same action again.\u201d Van\nBergen v. Minnesota, 59 F.3d 1541, 1547 (8th Cir. 1995). The Schoolchildren argue\nthat this exception applies because Arkansas voluntarily ceased the challenged action\nwhen it amended the immunization statute, and, therefore, might repeal the new\nexemption provision at any time if not prohibited from doing so by court order. In\nadvancing this argument, however, the Schoolchildren speculate as to a mere\ntheoretical possibility. A speculative possibility is not a basis for retaining\njurisdiction over a moot case. Id. (\u201cThe party need not show with certainty that the\nsituation will recur, but a mere physical or theoretical possibility is insufficient to\novercome the jurisdictional hurdle of mootness.\u201d).\n\n       Review of the facts makes clear the speculative nature of the Schoolchildren\u2019s\nargument. The Arkansas legislature promptly acted to provide a broadened\nexemption for philosophical and religious objectors as well as objectors who claimed\nmedical necessity. The legislature took this action even though the outstanding\ndistrict court decisions held the existing statute constitutional even without a religious\nexemption. The legislature took this action not only to protect the Schoolchildren,\nbut also to protect additional children not involved in this litigation who had received\nexemptions under the earlier, unconstitutional exemption provision. These additional\nchildren, like the Schoolchildren, would have been subject to exclusion from school\n\n                                          -13-\n\funder the district courts\u2019 decisions. Simply put, the legislature acted quickly for the\nbenefit of the Schoolchildren and other citizens of Arkansas to replace the stricken\nexemption provision with an exemption it believed would pass constitutional muster.\nIn providing relief for philosophical objectors as well as eliminating the requirement\nthat religious objectors belong to a \u201crecognized religion,\u201d the legislature provided\nrelief greater than that requested in the present litigation.\n\n       The Department of Health also acted quickly by passing regulations before the\nstart of a new school year. In sum, we find nothing to suggest a likelihood that\nArkansas might repeal its exemption or that Arkansas voluntarily ceased the\nchallenged behavior merely to thwart our jurisdiction. With no \u201creasonable\nexpectation\u201d that the Schoolchildren will again face forced immunization for\nHepatitis B without the possibility of exemption, the exception to the mootness\ndoctrine does not apply.\n\n       The Schoolchildren argue not only that the general mootness exception applies,\nbut also that, because the state voluntarily altered its own laws, the specialized\nexception for voluntary cessation applies. City of Mesquite v. Aladdin\u2019s Castle, Inc.,\n455 U.S. 283, 289 (1982) (\u201cIt is well settled that a defendant\u2019s voluntary cessation of\na challenged practice does not deprive a federal court of its power to determine the\nlegality of the practice.\u201d). This exception, however, is merely a specialized form of\nthe general exception discussed above and provides no basis for retaining jurisdiction\nin the present case. \u201c[T]he standard we have announced for determining whether a\ncase has been mooted by the defendant\u2019s voluntary conduct is stringent: \u2018a case\nmight become moot if subsequent events made it absolutely clear that the allegedly\nwrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.\u2019\u201d Young v. Hayes, 218\nF.3d 850, 852 (8th Cir. 2000) (quoting United States v. Concentrated Phosphate\nExport Ass\u2019n, 393 U.S. 199, 203 (1968)). As explained above, there is no basis on\nwhich to conclude that the challenged behavior\u2013mandatory immunization against\nHepatitis B without the availability of an exemption\u2013might reasonably be expected\nto recur.\n\n                                         -14-\n\f       Finally, we reject the Schoolchildren\u2019s new challenges to the procedural\nrequirements of the amended legislation and the accompanying implementing\nregulations. These requirements include an annual exemption application,\nsubmission of a notorized statement to request the exemption, completion of an\neducational component that \u201cincludes information on the risks and benefits of\nvaccination,\u201d submission of a signed informed consent statement regarding refusal\nto vaccinate, and submission of a signed statement authorizing the Department of\nHealth to exclude non-immunized children from school during the presence of an\noutbreak of a covered disease. See Ark.Code Ann. \u00a76-18-702(4)(A) (2003). The\nSchoolchildren conceded during the course of these proceedings that a state may\nexercise its police power to exclude non-immunized children from public schools\nduring an actual emergency, such as an outbreak. Further, none of the procedural\nrequirements of the amended statute and new regulations empowers Officials to\nassess the merits of the Schoolchildren\u2019s beliefs, and the requirements for religious\nobjectors mirror those for philosophical objectors. Finally, the basis of their\nchallenges to the educational components and application requirements are not\nentirely clear as these requirements apply equally to philosophical objectors as well\nas religious objectors.\n\n       We need not resolve these challenges, however, because any challenges to the\nprocedural requirements are not yet ripe. To the extent the Schoolchildren challenge\nthe educational component or other aspects of the application process under the new\nexemption, their claims are speculative and involve no concrete injury\u2013no\nSchoolchildren have applied for nor been denied exemption under the new statute.\nThe purpose of the ripeness doctrine is \u201cto prevent the courts, through avoidance of\npremature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements over\nadministrative policies, and also to protect the agencies from judicial interference\nuntil an administrative decision has been formalized and its effects felt in a concrete\nway by the challenging parties.\u201d Abbot Labs. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 148-49\n(1967). Were we to address the newly enacted exemption statute and regulations\nbefore first giving the Department of Health the opportunity to work with the\n\n                                         -15-\n\fSchoolchildren, we would inappropriately and prematurely entangle the court in an\nabstract disagreement.\n\n      In Case Nos. 02-3035, 02-3094, 02-3104, and 02-3195 we dismiss all pending\nclaims as moot and all newly raised challenges as unripe for review.\n                        ______________________________\n\n\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\f"
