    "text": "Wednesday, December 31, 2014\n\nAfter\npaying our monthly expenses I was able to make my monthly deposit into\nsavings. I also signed up for the\ncompany 401(k) plan at work since it was open enrollment time.\n\nSince\nI've been paying it down every month and all I owe now is for my box spring and\nmattress I went ahead and ordered my bed frame, headboard and side table from\neBay. I found a pretty light fixture to\nreplace the broken one in my bedroom on sale for 50% off at Home Depot\nonline. I put it on my PayPal account as\nwell. I worked enough overtime to cover my PayPal payment plus quite a bit\nextra and the light fixture.\n\nChristmas\nwas paid for from my fund that I saved up all throughout the year plus two gift\ncards I had. I was pretty happy with how\nmuch I was able to do with so little money this year. I was a little concerned about it but wonderful\nsales, coupons and creativity plus a great stash of sewing and craft supplies\nhelp out a lot.\n\nI ended\nthe month with quite a bit of money left in my checking account. Part of it I used to purchase a set of\nquilted organizers to keep my Christmas china in and a set of felt pads to put\nbetween the pieces. I put the rest\ntoward my PayPal account and made an extra payment.\n\nI received\na Christmas bonus from my employer this month.\nI was thrilled because it was totally unexpected. I decided to set it aside to use for a family\nvacation next year. We haven\u2019t had one\nof those in a very long time.\n\nLooking\nback at the year we just had I am amazed at all that I have accomplished\nwithout adding any substantial debt. In\nfact I was able to pay down debt, increase savings, fund Christmas, refurnish\nan entire house, pay all of our monthly bills, either early or on time, (I\nprefer early) and establish an emergency fun.\nThe best part is I didn\u2019t feel like I was sacrificing that much to\naccomplish my financial goals.\n\nWith\nnew goals set for 2015 I will continue my uber thrifty ways and see what more I\ncan accomplish in the coming year. I'm\nthrilled and excited to get started.\n\nTuesday, December 30, 2014\n\nWell,\nI didn\u2019t stay on budget and I have to admit I didn't really try too hard. There were so many great buys and we did A\nLOT of entertaining this month. I'm not\nunhappy with my final total but I do have a ton of ideas swirling around in my\nhead of ways to do better in 2015.\n\nMy\nnon food budget came in at $12.98 for a 16# bag of cat food on sale and a bag\nof cat litter. That was it. I didn't buy anything else.\n\nThis\nis what I bought for food this month:\n\nGroceries\n\n$$$\n\nSteak\n\n3.66\n\nMarkdown\n\nSteak\n\n3.88\n\nMarkdown\n\nSteak\n\n6.86\n\nMarkdown\n\nSteak\n\n7.00\n\nMarkdown\n\nGround\nBeef\n\n2.56\n\nMarkdown\n\nGround\nBeef\n\n2.46\n\nMarkdown\n\nGround\nBeef\n\n2.58\n\nMarkdown\n\nGround\nBeef\n\n2.42\n\nMarkdown\n\nWW\nFlour (2)\n\n2.10\n\nSale\n\nFrozen\nvegetables (6)\n\n4.74\n\nStore\nCoupon\n\nSoda -\n2 liter (3)\n\n2.00\n\nSale/Coupon\n\nOlives\n(3)\n\n2.67\n\nStore\nCoupon\n\nBacon\n\n6.98\n\nBologna\n\n0.98\n\nSale\n\nSmoked\nsausage\n\n4.68\n\nSale\n\nCheese\n(6)\n\n10.00\n\nStore\nCoupon\n\nCereal\n\n1.69\n\nCereal\n\n0.99\n\nSale/Coupon\n\nCereal\n\n1.16\n\nSale/Coupon\n\nChicken\n\n4.62\n\nSale\n\nCrackers\n(3)\n\n5.00\n\nStore\nCoupon\n\nCanned\nvegetables (4)\n\n1.00\n\nSale/Coupon\n\nStuffing\n(2)\n\n0.98\n\nStore\nCoupon\n\nMilk -\ngal.\n\n2.09\n\nNon-stick\nspray (2)\n\n0.98\n\nStore\nCoupon\n\nEggs -\ndoz.

How did you save money on groceries this\nmonth? Were you able to find some good\nsales and stock up on anything?\n\nMonday, December 29, 2014\n\nI\npeeled the label off of the empty pumpkin roll scented hand soap dispenser and\nused Goo Gone to get the adhesive cleaned off.\nI refilled it with soap and put it back on the kitchen sink to use\nrather than sending it off to the recycle bin.\n\nI rendered\nsome bacon fat and refilled my dripping jar that I keep in the refrigerator.\n\nOn\nChristmas Eve I made a huge salad by clearing out the crisper drawer and using\nup a huge variety of veggies I found in there.\nThere was enough salad to go with our dinner that night and again on Christmas.\n\nOn\nChristmas morning I collected any reusable gift bags, gift boxes, tissue paper,\nbubble wrap, and bows. I put them away\nfor next year.\n\nI used\nup three egg yolks left over after baking macaroons by making a lemon curd for\na cream pie for Christmas dessert. I had\na graham cracker crust in the pantry I had purchased at the dollar store a few\nmonths ago and also some leftover whipped topping in the freezer. I had originally planned to make a pumpkin\npie but the lemon really called to us.\nIt was delicious by the way.\n\nI made\na pint of Creamy Italian Salad Dressing and another one of 1000 Island.\n\nThe day\nafter Christmas I watched some tutorial videos for free on Youtube so I could\nlearn a few new crochet stitches. It\ninspired me to dig out my knitting bag which is filled with odds and ends of\nyarn left from finished projects. As a\nresult I started my first Christmas gift for 2015.\n\nI\nprinted six online grocery coupons.\n\nI\nshopped the weekly ads online and made up a new grocery list for January. I was excited to see several items from my\n\"Stock Up\" list were in the Albertson's ad.\n\nWe watched\nCastle on Hulu for free. I also watched The Blacklist after the girls went to bed.\n\nFriday, December 26, 2014\n\nThere\nare a few things I want to be sure and accomplish while the girls are off\nschool for the holidays. Some of these\ntasks they can do while I'm at work which is a huge help to me.\n\nWash coats, hats,\nscarves & gloves\n\nWash backpacks\nand lunch boxes\n\nWash bedding and\npillows\n\nFinish raking the\nleaves before the next snowstorm\n\nSend thank you\nnotes for gifts\n\nOrganize and put\naway the gift wrapping supplies\n\nOrganize and put\naway the Christmas decorations\n\nClean the oven\n\nStarting\nthe new year with everything clean and tidy will help me feel like I am truly\nmaking a fresh start in 2015.\n\nI\nordered a set of quilted china storage cases and some felt pads to place\nbetween each piece. I've always wanted a\nset of these and I figured no better time than the present. After pricing out what it would cost to make\nmy own felt pads it came out to be the same cost as the ones I purchased. I thought these things would be more\nexpensive than they were but I got everything I needed from Amazon for $36 with\nfree shipping. Now my Christmas china\nwill be safely stored away and much more easily accessible.\n\nI\nwill be making and using homemade greeting cards for all of us to send out our thank\nyous. I still have plenty of Christmas\nstamps and return address labels to use too.\n\nHow\nabout you? Do you have a list of things\nto get done before year end?\n\nTuesday, December 23, 2014\n\nI\ndidn't do a lot of decorating this year.\nOur lights weren't working so we didn't hang anything up outdoors and\nour box of Christmas wreaths is missing so we no longer have those to put up\neither. We were hoping they were\n\"accidentally misplaced\" and might reappear on our doorstep one day\nbut that didn't happen. So we move on.\n\nYou've\nall seen our Christmas tree and it is very pretty with the strands of still\nworking lights on it and all of our pretty ornaments on display. A lot of sentimental ones to remind us of\nloved ones and times past.\n\nMy\nmother made the glass block present for me several years ago.\n\nI've\nhad this Santa quite awhile now.\n\nThe\nmantle is my favorite. I had a lot of\nfun decorating it. Thanks to my next\ndoor neighbor's row of hedges I was able to bring in some fresh greenery. The pink Fenton bowl belonged to my\ngrandmother and the vintage bulbs came from my grandparents light strings. I just love them. The ornaments in the vase were the very first\nones I ever bought when I moved out on my own.\n\nI\npainted the Santa at a ceramics class I took quite some time ago. This year I decided to surround him with my\ngrandparent's elves. They had those in\ntheir home for as long as I can remember.\nThe kerosene lamp belonged to my great-grandmother.\n\nAnd\nour table.\n\nMy\ngrandmother's tablecloths have been getting quite a workout since\nThanksgiving. Because of the red chairs\nI decided to layer her lace cloth over her red one to break up the sea of red. I like the look. More greenery and a few tea lights for our\ntablescape."
