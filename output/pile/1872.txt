Mine would be one without\nthis documentary.\n\n------\nstefantalpalaru\nIt's propaganda about propaganda and it seems targeted at westerners. Too many\nsensitive subjects for Dear Leader's flock.\n\n------\nbediger4000\nThe definition of \"reality tee vee\" given: shows about \"talentless narcissists\nwho like to talk about themselves and go shopping\".\n\nThis is the kind of material that has endeared North Korea to propaganda\ncognoscenti everywhere.\n\n------\nericxb\nThe film was produced in New Zealand. Here is a link to a video report which\nincludes an interview with the producer:\n\n[http://ondemand.tv3.co.nz/Media-3-Season-1-Ep-16/tabid/59/ar...](http://ondemand.tv3.co.nz/Media-3-Season-1-Ep-16/tabid/59/articleID/8890/MCat/540/Default.aspx)\n\n------\ncalciphus\nLet's take a moment here and wonder a \"documentary team\" in a country with the\nkind of dictatorial control that North Korea has would have access to so much\nAmerican TV footage.\n\n\"Leaked\"? You mean \"released by the North Korean government\"?\n\n~~~\nChuckMcM\nIf you read the back story the translator believes exactly that, which is to\nsay that the DPRK created it for westerners. What is interesting is that the\nwebsite its on has completely bought into the message. They say things like\n\"And jesus, is it on the f&k*g money.\"\n\nThat suggests that it was targeted exactly to the sort of non-critical\nthinker/reader that the site \"superchief\" represents, and by all indications\nmanages to hit on all of the sensitive spots. That is the point of propaganda,\nand whether it is anti-Semitic white supremacist crap or DPRK crap it requires\nthat the person reading it check their assumptions at the door.\n\n"
