My friend didn't get any so I wanted to trade him one of mine. But when I tried it said that I didn't have enough stardust. It doesn't say how much more I need it just says I can't trade. How much stardust do I need to trade?\nThen later I traded with another friend and we tried to trade again but it said I can only do one special trade per day. Is there another way to trade pokemon so we can do it multiple times in one day?\n\nA:\n\nSpecial trades are unregistered, shiny or Legendary Pokemon.\nThe amount of stardust depends on your friendship level and what you are trading it can be between 100- 1,000,000 stardust.\nYou can find the exact value of the trade you want to do with a quick search.\nFor shiny Pokemon that is new:\n\nGood - 1,000,00\nGreat - 800,000\nUltra - 80,000\nBest - 40,000\n\nThe only time they have allowed multiply special trade in one day is if you are at a go fest.  \n\n"
