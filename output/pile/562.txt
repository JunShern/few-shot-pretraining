The Kind LED K5 series gives you complete control of the exact spectrum\nand quantity of light your plants are going to receive. By understanding how best to tune your Kind LED grow light you can maximise your results while\nusing the least amount of power possible.\n..\n\nThursday, August 06, 2015\n\nThe STASH awards have just been posted by High Times magazine. What does STASH stand for you ask? Significant Technological Achievements in Secretive Horticulture\nwhich is featured by High Times, it celebrates advances made by the cultivation community as well as tried-and-true products that have stood the test\nof time. These include lighting products, organic and hydroponic nutrients, new additives and practically anything else that helps increase yields\nor reduce hassles. ..\n\nFriday, May 22, 2015\n\nKind LED recently conducted a thorough examination of the major LED grow lighting companies\u2019 products. They did this in order to create a Kind LED Comparison\nby obtaining scientific data regarding the PPFD (Photosynthetic Photon Flux Density) readings and spectral output at a variety of heights, distances,\nand positions below the fixtures. ..\n\nFriday, April 24, 2015\n\nVertical farming applications for LED grow lighting are rare and impressive. In many places around the world, space is very limited, and those are precisely\nthe conditions in which food prices are highest. If a creative grower can take advantage of a vertical farming strategy, they can yield an incredible\namount of produce per square foot on that land, for which they are paying only by the horizontal area. .."
