    "text": "Google Trends for Websites\n\nIf you\u2019re a site owner, webmaster, SEO, or otherwise have an interest in website metrics, I think you\u2019re going to like Google Trends for Websites. It\u2019s almost as addictive to me as Google Maps is for, you know, normal people. \ud83d\ude42 You\u2019re probably familiar with regular Google Trends, which lets you see trends in how people search for difference phrases such as full moon or skiing vs. swimming. Here\u2019s the graph of how often people search for \u201cfull moon,\u201d for example:\n\nThose spikes correspond nicely to when full moons actually happen. Now you can do similar fun things with sites. Here\u2019s a simple example with my site, mattcutts.com:\n\nAs you can see, Trends will try to estimate the number of visitors to my site over time. (The product is free, but you have to sign in if you want to get estimated numbers \u2014 otherwise you see the graph but not the number estimates.) There\u2019s other good info too, though. See the graph below, for example:\n\nThis is saying that people who visited mattcutts.com also visited searchmarketingexpo.com and sphinn.com. You can \u201csurf\u201d related sites just by clicking around. You can also see what else people searched for. And you can even enter in two sites, separated by commas, to compare the estimated number of visitors between the sites:\n\nIt\u2019s a lot of fun, especially if website metrics is your cup of tea. You can read the official blog post or Barry Schwartz did a write-up as well. The comments are pointing out that some sites might not have much/any data. I think that that\u2019s mainly because there\u2019s a minimum threshold of traffic before Trends is willing to show statistics for a site \u2014 bear in mind that this is a launch on Google Labs. But you can still do some fun analysis with Trends for Websites, even though it\u2019s in Google Labs. And it is free, so give it a try.\n\nIs there any information on how the data is collected, Matt? Some site data I\u2019ve tried just seems extremely inconsistent with other traffic-estimator tools out there that I\u2019ve used. Still a great idea for Google to offer up this information, though. Very handy, even just from an estimation standpoint.\n\nSorry to change the subject (and not follow that webmasters url but I doubt there\u2019s any answer to this over there) but did Google do a pagerank update or something along those lines this past week? My inbound traffic from Google plummeted Tuesday and Wednesday and my site just lost like 2/3rd\u2019s of its overall traffic (yet I\u2019m still very well indexed.)\n\nI\u2019ve maintained a stable level for almost a full year and if this was a PR update, it literally just killed my site.\n\nNever thought to use it to track websites. I also check it out just to see the fluctuation of a niche, but this looks pretty effective too. Closely inline with what Alexa does, but with a different angle.\n\nnetmeg, if you sign in, the Y-axis of the traffic graph will have estimated numbers; otherwise it won\u2019t. I\u2019m not positive why they want people to sign in to get numbers \u2014 maybe to prevent abuse or scraping?\n\nCraig Graue and Greg, there\u2019s some info about that in the FAQ. They say:\n\nTrends for Websites combines information from a variety of sources, such as aggregated Google search data, aggregated opt-in anonymous Google Analytics data, opt-in consumer panel data, and other third-party market research. The data is aggregated over millions of users, powered by computer algorithms, and doesn\u2019t contain personally identifiable information. Additionally, Google Trends for Websites only shows results for sites that receive a significant amount of traffic, and enforces minimum thresholds for inclusion in the tool.\n\nGreg, you might also want to read why I personally am skeptical of data from the toolbar, especially as any kind of signal. As far as how this compares to other services like Compete/Quantcast/Alexa/Comscore/Hitwise/Nielsen/whatever, I think most people will try several services and eventually choose the service that they like the best. My personal opinion again, but I think it\u2019s good to have different companies all tackling metrics, because you get a better feel for the possible range of answers.\n\nGlad if it proves helpful, Tom Lynch. \ud83d\ude42\n\nPaul William Tenny, I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s been a PageRank update in the last couple months. Is it the site linked to from your comment?\n\nJojo, I asked about that myself. Personally, I\u2019d love to get as much data as possible, even data about various Google properties. My guess is that they were worried that people would take the traffic estimates as some sort of forward-looking guidance and possibly misinterpret it. Bear in mind that it is a Google Labs launch, so consider it an early-stage feature. I passed that feedback on though.\n\nMorris Rosenthal, I don\u2019t know how often they update the data. For my site it seemed to be things from the last month or so.\n\ndan horton seo, I thought you might like this. Now you\u2019ve got something you could blog about on a slow day. \ud83d\ude42\n\nLukas Stuber, is there an example site that blocks Google but where we\u2019re showing data? If so, let me know and I\u2019ll pass the example on.\n\nPaul William Tenny, I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s been a PageRank update in the last couple months. Is it the site linked to from your comment?\n\nIt is, and if it\u2019s not a PR update or something along those lines, then I\u2019m fairly stumped here. A friend of my site told me she saw sudden drop off in traffic for her site as well and there\u2019s nothing we share in common \u2014 I run Moveable Type on shared hosting, she\u2019s on Blogspot. I\u2019ve never seen a near 70% loss in traffic in a 48-hour period like this and the overwhelming source for it is/used to be Google.\n\nI saw nothing in the webmaster tools that would indicate that I\u2019ve been dropped from the index or penalized for any reason and a drop like this has never happened before so it\u2019s not just streaky traffic. But if it\u2019s not a PR update either, then I\u2019m sorry for distracting you from the topic of Trends (which I find very nifty, btw.) I just don\u2019t see how it could be anything else.\n\nHey matt !! I suppose this is confidential data !! If companies like: Compete, Hitwise, Quantcast, Comscore, Alexa, Nielsen. \u2026 etc as u had mentioned in your above comment gives data .. they also gives data for there company .. .. i.e \u2026 You can see alexa info for alexa.com .. But we cant see Google.com data on Google trends ..\nIs there something to block a site from Google Trends ? As I have some b2b clients with me and they will never like to share there data this way !!\n\nAnkit, I don\u2019t think any of those services (Compete, Quantcast, etc.) provide an opt-out for websites right now, so to make the product useful (even on Labs), I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s an explicit opt-out right now. If a site is not in Google or gets below a certain threshold of traffic then it won\u2019t be shown though.\n\n\u201cMy guess is that they were worried that people would take the traffic estimates as some sort of forward-looking guidance and possibly misinterpret it.\u201d\nSo, they should misinterpret the traffic estimates from yahoo.com or msn.com, but not from google.com or google.de? That is not an logical explanation. \ud83d\ude09\n\nFor that site that lost most of its Google refered traffic,\u2026 Try changing some anchor texts of the menu and/or add some new links in the left column or any other place that will show these links in all pages. Then wait for most pages to get indexed and see what happens.\n\n(in case she recently added a whole bunch of new links to the site, advice her to take them out and wait for it to get reindexed as well and see what happens.)\n\nHmm, the head of Google\u2019s web spam team links to a site on his personal Blog that is *taking money for selling links for PageRank*, I point the fact out and Matt deletes MY post *leaving the link there* ???????\n\nYou did exactly the same when I pointed out the fact the Google sponsors conferences where black hat tricks are taught.\n\nCome on Matt, pretending the Google left hand is not fighting the Google right hand doesn\u2019t make it so.\n\nPlease correct me if i am wrong, but doesn\u2019t Google Trends measure search volume only? Why would anyone use Google Trends this way other than to see how many times a URL has been typed in as a search query? The reason I bring this up is because it appears that since you have posted this there have been allot of web masters confusing \u201csearch volume\u201d and \u201cweb traffic\u201d.\n\nYea; I might have had some privacy concerns for some of my clients, but so far I can\u2019t get anything to actually show any traffic except for my fireworks site, and that\u2019s only for a short time every June/July.\n\nNice feature, but it needs work. It\u2019s wrong for all sites I checked (always like 75% less visitors than the site has according to analytics) or it doesn\u2019t have data which is in most cases because a site seems to need at least 5000 visitors per day before it shows any data.\n\nMost brick & morter sites don\u2019t have that many visitors. At least not in Brazil.\n\nI was skeptical, especially about the also visited feature which sound very big brother. But since there seems to be a high threshold of visits before a site is listed it does not invade privacy.\n\nOne thing that I cannot figure out is in the Also searched for column there are multiple bars for each search term. Is it comparing all the web sites for the most common search term from all user of all the web sites?\n\nA nice feature for sure, but as mentioned above it\u2019s significantly understating visitors vs analytics. I guess the trends team can\u2019t use analytics data 1 because of privacy and 2 because then the data sources wouldn\u2019t be consistent across the sites (as some won\u2019t have analytics on them). Handy toy though.\n\nI have to say, for those sites that do show data, it is GREAT. This makes it very easy to show the results of our SEO. Finally something that doesn\u2019t require people to login to analytics or other statistics software for which you have to first give an explanation of all the stuff that they\u00b4re showing.\n\nPlease don\u2019t make it work for small sites!. If I wanted to make my traffic stats public to the world I\u2019d publish them on my own site thank you very much. This needs an opt-out provision (without opting out of being indexed) quite badly. As someone put it in another thread on this subject \u201cDo No Evil\u201d? ha!\n\nGoogle trends looks like a nice tool, but unfortunately, when I type in my sites and my competitors\u2019 sites, the graph has no labels on the Y axis, so I can\u2019t really see the number of daily unique visitors. \ud83d\ude41\n\nMatt \u2013 catching up on your posts via RSS and wanted to mention something I haven\u2019t seen you post about\u2026 if you have, forgive me.\n\nHeard a story on NPR\u2019s Marketplace (evening edition) on June 24 re: Google will soon kick off Ad Planner, helping its advertisers by providing a marketing assessment/audience measurement and making unbiased recommendations as to where to best spend their ad dollars. Commentary came from reporter Media Week\u2019s Mike Shields; can you give us Google\u2019s comment?\nHere\u2019s a link to the story that ran:http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2008/06/24/online_ads/\n\nI have used Google trends more than google keyword/adword tool. I have been successful in SEO with Google insights and some other tools also.Geographic, year wise trends shows good reuslts with god traffic.One can select some 2 words phrases and few one word keyword to get permanent good traffic for your website."
