The literal meaning of the words \"Kirkkonummi\" and \"Kyrksl\u00e4tt\" in English is \"church heath\".\n\nThe municipality is located just outside the Helsinki Metropolitan Area, bordering the city of Espoo in the east. Other neighbouring municipalities are Vihti and Siuntio. The distance from the municipal centre to central Helsinki is some .

Over the recent years, Kirkkonummi has faced the highest population growth rate in the country, over 3% per annum.\n\nMajor population centres in Kirkkonummi include the municipal centre, Masala, Veikkola, Kantvik and the Upinniemi naval garrison area. In addition to these, there are dozens of smaller villages. Geographically, Kirkkonummi has two famous peninsulas, namely Porkkala and Upinniemi, the latter one of which houses a major Finnish naval base. Porkkala is also on one of the main bird migration routes in the Baltic Sea region. Additionally, Kirkkonummi has a large central plains area, through which a railway goes from Helsinki to Turku as well as extensive lake areas, much of which is relatively untouched wilderness.\n\nKirkkonummi has been populated from the Stone Age to the present day as evidenced by the very first Stone Age rock paintings found in Finland that are located by lake Vittr\u00e4sk in the central lake region of Kirkkonummi. Incidentally, these paintings were found by the famous Finnish composer Jean Sibelius himself. The southern half of the municipality was leased to the Soviet Union between 1945 and 1956 for use as a naval base as part of the peace settlement that ended the hostilities between the Soviet Union and Finland during World War II. Signs of this time include concrete bunkers, other fortifications and the remains of an airbase.\n\nOther places of interest located in Kirkkonummi include the medieval stone church in the municipal centre, the wooden church in the village of Haapaj\u00e4rvi as well as the Hvittr\u00e4sk manor designed by Finnish architects Eliel Saarinen, Herman Gesellius and Armas Lindgren.\n\nPolitics\nResults of the 2011 Finnish parliamentary election in Kirkkonummi:\n\nNational Coalition Party   30.7%\nSocial Democratic Party   16.8%\nTrue Finns   16.3%\nSwedish People's Party   14.3%\nGreen League   10.1%\nCentre Party   4.4%\nLeft Alliance   3.6%\nChristian Democrats   2.3%\n\nInternational relations\n\nTwin towns \u2014 Sister cities\nKirkkonummi is twinned with:\n\n  Sundbyberg, Sweden  \n  Paldiski, Estonia\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\n  Municipality of Kirkkonummi \u2013 official website\n\n \nCategory:Greater Helsinki\nCategory:Populated coastal places in Finland\nCategory:Populated places established in the 1330s"
