In fact, at the end of the 28 miles, I could have kept going while my companions were completely spent. This was the first time I had finished without being in pain in 4 years of bicycle racing.If that wasn\u2019t enough, after just two months use of PEOs, after a routine medical checkup, my doctor asked me in a very serious way what I had been doing differently? Because I have been runningslightlyhighonmycholesterolfor several years, I expected to be told that my cholesterol had become worse and that I needed to go on drugs to reduce it. Instead, he told me that my cholesterol had come down 40 points, with my good cholesterol being higher and my bad cholesterol being much lower. I told him the only thing different that I had been doing was supplementing with PEOs.Patrick S\u2022At 70 and after having a serious spinal injury one of my challenges is intensifying my physical workouts. I am intent on rebuilding lean muscle mass and endurance. Cramping and pain from lactic acid buildup during aggressive workouts plague everyone and especially people my age. Since consuming Parent Essential Oils before my workouts and again later in the day, I have seen dramatic results. My recovery is amazing even when I have gone way too far and past common sense. Hank H\u2022Since using these parent oils for the first time now I can tell that my mind is sharper. It\u2019s been about a week since I started taking them and have been able to notice the difference. Very encouraging. Sue C.\n\n\u2022I just wanted to provide some feedback on one patient that I implemented the use of PEOs for atopic dermatitis. He had been taking 6 grams of fish oil per day as he was on some bizarre, weight-lifting-crazy, low-fat diet where the only fat he took was fish oil. I stopped his fish oil (of course!) and started PEOs in combination with good skin care and some mild topical steroids\u2026. After fifteen doctors, seven years of severe, almost debilitating, eczema was gone in two months. An absolutely fabulous case!! Made my day!!Dr. Jonathan Carp, M.D.\u2022High blood pressure has been my problem for a long time. I have been on medication for this and my real desire is to not take this any longer. After just one week of using Parent Essential Oils my blood pressure is reading normal! This is the first time I have seen a \u2018supplement\u2019 have this kind of effect on me. I am very encouraged. Corene C.\u2022I knew that if you guys recommended these PEOs I would probably be pleased with the outcome. I was still surprised that I could tell a definite increase of quality energy after taking them even the first time. As a retired electrical engineer I analyze things quite well and I am excited about using the parent essential fatty acids long term. Marcie R.\u2022I did order two bottles of the Parent Essential Oils and started taking them on Tuesday. I immediately noticed that I experienced less effort to do physical exercise and had a quicker recovery afterwards on my very next morning workout. Since I am in my 70\u2019s I usually do not notice benefits so quickly when beginning to use a new supplement.Mel W.\n\nblog\n\nOxygen4Cells.com\n\nPEOs - The Smart Way toOxygenate Your Cells!\n\n\u2022I became a believer in PEOs when after taking 4 PEO soft gels before beginning a 28 mile cross-country bike race, I finished the race with no joint pain and no muscle cramps.
