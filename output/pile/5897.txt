    "text": "He said working on technique is for preseason and once he started playing, all that mattered was watching the ball.\n\nThat, I\u2019ve discovered, is a very traditional response, handed down from father to son.\n\nI had to stop myself from groaning out loud. \u201cHow short-sighted\u201d I wanted to reply. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s not alone and these days, coaches are reluctant to challenge technical issues in young players, preferring the students to figure it out themselves. Perhaps they fear intervention will only create more problems.\n\nNO PRE-SEASON?\n\nWhat if a player never has a pre-season as, like me, he plays continuously on both sides of the world, where the seasons overlap?\n\nJust once did I have a pre-season in Australia \u2013 and that I remember mostly for the agony of running the sand-hills at City Beach in Perth, rather than any working on technique.\n\nInstead I was chasing an endless summer by playing 12 months of the year in England as well as home. \u201cWhat is a pre-season?\u201d was my standard jibe at teammates.\n\nThat meant technical experimentation had to be done on the job \u2013 so the standard answer to not work on your game for six months of the year seems like a waste of time and opportunity to me.\n\nOften as a young batsman, you\u2019ll have days when you pick up a bat and it feels like it is a natural extension of your body and other days when it feels like you\u2019re hefting around a railway sleeper.\n\nDAYS WHEN THINGS WEREN\u2019T WORKING\n\nNumerous days in grade cricket and even opening the batting for Western Australia, my swing would feel so awkward I would be trying to adjust almost every ball. I might try picking the bat up higher in my swing, other times move my hands forward in my stance and even change the width of my stance. These were just a very few of many.\n\nIn fact what would really confuse me is, somehow I\u2019d last until the lunch break feeling like I couldn\u2019t hit one off the square and then come out after a 40 minute sit down and feel like I was Brian Lara \u2026 well not quite but you get the drift.\n\nWhat it taught me though was to keep trying to get better. I would often think to myself, and now sprout this to every kid possible, one step back to go two steps forward. Working with my dad who was my coach, I\u2019d try all sorts of technical changes and usually, after a while, something would click and it would all fall into place. It would be like hitting at a brick wall and then all of a sudden one thing works and the rest fall over like dominoes.\n\nPROBLEM SOLVING \u2013 DON\u2019T GET OUT THE SAME WAY\n\nOne of the great advantages of playing in four innings matches is the chance to problem solve as a batsman between the first and second innings. I disliked \u2026 no, I hated getting out the same way or to the same bowler in the second innings as I did in the first.\n\nAfter getting out I would sit down and figure out a way to combat the bowler who dismissed me first time around. It might not have just been a mental change but quite possibly a technical one.\n\nStuart Clark once dismissed me for a duck with a perfect ball that pitched on off stump line and nipped away but instead of just accepting he\u2019d bowled me a jaffa, I checked out the footage and saw my hands were not coming down straight in my swing pattern and caused everything \u2013 my hands and bat \u2013 to go towards mid on. So my bat actually was inside the line, hence the ball found my outside edge.\n\nSecond innings, my focus was trying to get my hands to go towards mid-off while playing with the inside half of my bat to counter the away movement. Yes I know this is a bit more than \u2018Batting 101\u2019 but I only started to understand my own batting by constantly tinkering \u2013 even to the extent of working out what doesn\u2019t work, to find out what does."
