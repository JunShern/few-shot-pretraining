Avoid being the next victim of a\ndisreputable mover by learning the tricks of these fraudulent companies and educating\nyourself on the smart way to choose a reputable mover in your area.\n\nThe Today Show recently featured a segment on \"How to Avoid Being Scammed by\nmovers.\" In order to avoid these scams, it's critical that you know how to\nspot them. Get to know the top scams that can be attempted by a mover as identified\nby The Today Show:\n\nThe Hostage\n\nBait and Switch\n\nTrumped Up Delivery Charges\n\nLate (or Never) Delivery\n\nReckless Abandonment\n\nNow that you are familiar with the nicknames of common moving scams, let's go into\ndetail about what each of these terms mean. The Today Show segment explained the\nway a disreputable mover gets away with these popular scams as follows:\n\nThe Hostage:\n\nA mover provides you with an estimate, only to add extras on once they have your\nbelongings in their possession. Basically, their estimate is not valid, and they\ncan tack on as many additional costs as they'd like - doubling or tripling the\ncost of your move. If you want your furniture back, you have to conceded\nand pay the additional cost.\n\nBait and Switch:\n\nA mover will provide you with an estimate for the cost of your move, and then switch\nthis arranged deal at the last minute. They sell you on a low price, but in the\nend, the cost of your move ends up being nothing close to what you agreed to.\n\nTrumped\nUp Delivery Charges:\n\nA mover will tack on additional charges based on unfounded reasons. Say the mover\ngave you an estimate based on weight. After your valuables are on their truck, they\nthen charge you extra claiming the cubic feet have exceeded the weight estimate\nof your goods. Since this is impossible to calculate, you're stuck paying the\nfees or forsaking your goods.\n\nOther common trumped up charges include saying packing was not included in your\nestimate, charging more because your goods weren't totally packed and ready for\nthe move and so on.\n\nLate (or Never)\nDelivery:\n\nThis scam may be the worst of the bunch. A mover will come and pack, load and promise\nto deliver your belongings \"on-time.\" Then, they call saying your goods\nare in the back of a truck behind two other peoples' belongings, so you can't receive\nyour furniture until theirs is delivered first.\n\nOr, if the mover has a licensing violation and their truck is impounded in transit\nby the Department of Transportation, all your valuables are stuck on board until\nthe truck is released. Either of these situations result in your goods being\ndelivered weeks late...or not at all.\n\nReckless Abandonment:\n\nThis happens often with a rogue mover. A fly by the night mover will take your money,\nload your belongings, then close up shop and flee, abandoning your shipment either\non the truck or in a private storage facility. This scam allows the mover to take\noff with your money and your belongings. If you are lucky enough to find where\nyour belongings ended up, expect to pay exorbitant amounts of money to retrieve\nthem from the storage locale.\n\nDon't Fall Into the Traps Set by a Disreputable Mover!\n\nSo, now that you know the common rip-offs and scams executed by a shady mover, how\ncan you avoid these common pitfalls many individuals and families fall into when\nmoving? Do not despair; not all movers are despicable. Having a successful, affordable\nrelocation performed by a professional mover does not have to be a pipe dream. Below\nare some tips for choosing a mover for a happy, successful relocation:\n\nCheck the Company's Address: A REAL mover will have a REAL address.\nOnce you get the address, make sure you Google it or drive to the location to verify\nits legitimacy.\n\nAsk for Recommendations from Friends, Family and Neighbors: One\nof the best ways to find a great mover? Word of mouth from people they have moved\nbefore.\n\nAsk your Real Estate Agent: Real estate agents help people move\nall the time. They are a great source for a reputable mover.\n\nGet Three Competitive In-Home Estimates: Get three estimates from\nthree different moving companies. If there is a significant disparity, this will\nhelp you to easily identify a fraud.\n\nChoose a mover who Bases Price off Weight, Not Cubic Feet: This\nwill help guarantee and lock in the estimate they provide you initially.\n\nCheck the mover's Complaint History: If a mover has more than eight\ncomplaints on a given complaint website (Better Business Bureau, etc.), then you\nmight want to rethink electing them as your mover.\n\nHow to Protect Yourself from a Mover's Scams\n\nThere are some simple steps you can take to prevent falling into scams with a mover,\nand certain things you should never do when moving. Heed this advice,\nand benefit from a happier (and cheaper) move:\n\nDon't Fall for a Front Company: Double check that the mover has\na real address, and is not just some rogue mover representing its website as an\nactual business.\n\nDo Not Give a Deposit: A mover that demands a deposit upfront likely\nhas an agenda other than securely moving your belongings - like taking your money\nand running. If a mover demands a deposit, move on to a different company.\n\nDo NOT Pay Cash: Paying cash is asking for trouble. When you pay\ncash, there is no evidence of a transaction. Therefore, if your things aren't moved,\nor even worse, you don't get them back, you have no evidence of ever having paid\nfor service.\n\nMake Sure the Truck is Branded: Real moving companies have real\nmoving trucks, complete with branding and logos. To make sure crooks do not drive\noff with your valuables, check the truck for a company logo.\n\nDo Not Sign a Partial Contract: You would never sign a loan agreement,\npre-nup or binding contract of other sorts with blanks; the same rule applies for\nmoving contracts. Make sure the contract is complete and all filled in before signing\nanything.\n\nDo Not Agree to a Skinny Contract: Make sure you sign a complete\nmoving contract, or one that is more than two pages. All of your goods should be\nlisted on the contract.\n\nBuy Extra Insurance: A reputable mover will offer additional types\nof moving insurance to ensure you can have the highest protection should something\nhappen to your valuables during the move. Allied Van Lines offers Full Valuation\nCoverage that totally protects your shipment should damage or loss occur.\n\nAsk About the Mover's Claims Policy:\nFind out more about how the company processes claims in the event you should need\nto file one. Should you file a claim, you want to make sure it is handled quickly\nand properly.\n\nYou Deserve a Great Relocation Experience with a Professional Mover\n\nEveryone should be entitled to a secure, sound relocation at a fair price.

The driver did not load. The driver was not available to load so the local agent's crew did the loading. The driver picked up everything from the warehouse.\n\nAllied Van Lines\n\nThe delay in the delivery of my goods, from the big spread that was given originally. I performed the majority but the agent's crew packed the fragile. I was told the driver making the delivery was going to be loading, but an intermediate group did that.\n\nAllied Van Lines\n\nAllied Van Lines\n\nAll segments of the move were made extremely easy by personnel. My contact with the company was excellent. She was on top of everything and kept in perfect communication with me. They were efficient and they were as good as they could be. The driver was excellent and he was also very efficient to where I wanted special care taken.\n\nAllied Van Lines\n\nAllied Van Lines\n\nThe conduct and professionalism of all of the crew. The local agent's crew was great. They even unpacked some things for me. They were very helpful . He fixed a crack in the track for the drawer & put it back together. They were very flexible.\n\nAllied Van Lines\n\nWe moved from a different state. The movers themselves, how accommodating they were, we've never done a big move, movers were terrific, long day for them who said do you want us to stay, nice people. The driver was the only one at both locations. We had to change up the time, that backed things up a bit, instead of meeting at 8 we met at noon. They were flexible in accommodating. Exchanged #'s."
