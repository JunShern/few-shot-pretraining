Read Peace Wall as an enormous divide between communities that signifies the safety now experienced in Belfast and how far these communities still must come.)\n\nIt is no exaggeration that Belfast was one of the most war torn areas of the late 20th Century. Local terrorist organizations sprang into action in response to escalating tensions between 1968-1971. The story here mirrors the story in Derry. But that city is a tiny hamlet compared to Belfast. Shove a million people into a rain cloud, some who bleed green and others for the queen, a football pitch\u2019s worth of British tanks and troops, with an insatiable eye-for-an-eye mentality. You have 70s-90s Belfast.\n\nThe violence was unparalleled. As Michael Rock (today\u2019s tour guide) puts it, \u201cIf someone was killed on a Catholic Street by 10 AM, someone in a Protestant neighborhood would be dead by 12.\u201d Everyone was a target. Walls were constructed to keep communities separate. Like any city aspiring to be the best, the walls had to be built higher and higher. You know, to deter the bricks, bottles, fireworks launched from landing in their backyards.\n\nIt is obvious when you are in a Protestant Unionist community in Northern Ireland. Its vivid. The awnings and shops are blue and red. The streets are adorned with red, white and blue streamers, the light posts hoist the Union Jack. A couple reasons. The Queen\u2019s jubliee (currently visiting Northern Ireland, Mr. McGuinness tomorrow). The marching season is amping up. Check out the pictures of the bonfire preparations!\n\nEach community has their murals. It seems the Catholic Nationalists made a concerted attempt to give their areas a face lift. The images are less violent. Their causes slightly more universal (read: Palestine). Their symbolism notably lacks gun wielding, masked gunmen. It seems like the Protestant Unionists are getting the message. Sandy Row\u2019s murals are almost completely devoid of the violent imagery. Instead they tell a tale of the community\u2019s working class heart. But in the Shankill neighborhoods, along the Peace Wall yours truly is elegantly signing above, imagery of fallen UDA assassins still exists and some memorials are down right aggressively militaristic. When photographing one of them, a few children in this beat-down neighborhood shouted out: Everyday I\u2019m UDA. They were holding beebee guns. They pointed them at the taxi as we toured their neighborhood. It is this sense of intimidation I will be trying to erase, in myself, as I walk through to Shankill tomorrow.\n\nAlso on the docket: A visit with Sean Montgomery and the Skegoneill-Glandore Community Center (where Protestant and Catholic communities meet) to see what connections can be made for the young when there is not an enormous Interface (Peace Wall) between them. And a walk to the Ardoyne part of the Catholic neighborhood, The Falls. There I will begin my relationship with the group recording and facilitating the Interface Diaries. Compelling and exciting to introduce to my students.\n\nNed, My name is Jill, and I am a former FFT fellow, and I am enjoying learning along with you. Ireland is a magical place! Last summer as part of my fellowship, I stayed along the Antrim Coast in Northern Ireland with a storyteller named Liz Weir at her hostel. If you have time, she might be a good person for you to meet with or talk to about your fellowship. Liz is a wealth of information, and she is very passionate about teaching young children about respecting the differences in their community. She might offer an interesting perspective on what you are learning about. She is a former librarian for Belfast, and has witnessed many of the \u201cTroubles\u201d firsthand. On Saturday evenings she hosts locals and travelers to a storytelling and music night in her barn (a truly memorable experience).\n\nHere is her website: http://www.lizweir.net and a little blurb about her in case you are interested:\nJust tell her that Jill sent you. \ud83d\ude09\n\nShe has presented The Gift of the Gab, a storytelling series for BBC Radio Ulster, and has written scripts for five television animations aimed at young children in Northern Ireland. The latter project was created by the Media Initiative for Children, a joint effort by the Early Years Organisation in Northern Ireland, and the Peace Initiatives Institute in Colorado. These adverts use mass media and classroom experience to teach young children the value of respecting \u2013 and including \u2013 others who are different. http://www.early-years.org/mifc/\n\nJill, Thanks so much for your interest and support. At the moment I don\u2019t imagine having a night to commit to Liz on the Antrim coast. Belfast is amazing. At times frustrating and confounding, but also beautiful and rapt with potential. Stay tuned. Email me at ndougherty at vghs dot org on my school account so we surely keep in touch! Love peace."
