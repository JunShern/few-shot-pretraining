As long as crunchyroll pulls through on region licensing on Akame Ga Kill (if they get it) and some of the others like tokyo esp/ tokyo ghoul; its all cool\n\nturns out Samurai jam was pretty crap tier.

They are scheduled to premiere it at noon EDT tomorrow.\n\nThe best CR could likely score for it at this point would be one of those \"Ex-US, no English language\" licenses."
