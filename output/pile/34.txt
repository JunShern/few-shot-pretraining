Would-be settlers on their way to New Mexico gouged deep ruts in the landscape \u2013 those swales can still be seen in MinorPark, within view of the new RedBridge. The BlueRiver was the first major obstacle on the trail, and in 1859 a 100-foot long covered bridge was built. Someone painted it red, Jackson said, and the name has survived to this day. The bridge was replaced with steel in 1914, and again in the 1930s.\n\nIn the year 2000, as traffic volumes and population grew in the area, city officials began to talk seriously about replacing the Depression-era bridge, starting a plan that came to fruition on Friday.\n\nWhile the bridge was open for traffic on Friday, there is still more to be done \u2013 including one of the key features of the bridge: lighted monument plaques that celebrate 10 influential historical figures that pioneered settlement in the RedBridge area. Still to be installed are a series of red LED lights that will light up at night to carry on the tradition of having a \u201cred\u201d bridge.\n\nThe old RedBridge, pictured below, will remain a part of the area\u2019s history, Klein said, as it will be incorporated into bike and walking trails.\n\n\u201cThe old bridge will remain for pedestrian use,\u201d Klein said.\n\nCouncilman John Sharp said it was important to remember the core focus of the entire project \u2013 to improve public safety. He said the bridge saves commuters two or three minutes when trains pass \u2013 and those minutes could be vital.\n\n\u201cTwo to three minutes may not mean much if you\u2019re just driving home from work, but if you\u2019re the one waiting for an ambulance to get to your home, if you\u2019re the one waiting for a fire truck to get to your home, if you\u2019re the one waiting for a police car to get to your home, those two to three minutes could mean the difference between life or death,\u201d Sharp said. \u201cThat\u2019s what this project is \u2013 a public safety enhancement.\u201d\n\nSharp said he couldn\u2019t wait for the lights and artwork to be installed.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a beautiful bridge now, but it\u2019s going to be a lot more beautiful,\u201d he said.\n\nThe bridge features several look-out points where pedestrians can stop and take in a scenic view of the [river] valley, Sharp said, and historical plaques will tell the pioneer history of the area.\n\n\u201cIt will be an educational destination,\u201d Sharp said. \u201cUnlike a lot of monuments, it will be one that will reflect the ethnic and gender diversity of the pioneers of this area.\u201d\n\nCouncilman Scott Taylor said the bridge was key to the future of South Kansas City, and that the associated pedestrian and bicycle paths could draw new people to the area.\n\n\u201cThis RedBridge is so important in our district that it can\u2019t be understated,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cIt\u2019s not only an improvement for commuters but for joggers and bikers. As we attract new families to Kansas City, this is one of the amenities that families are looking for.\u201d\n\nTaylor passed the microphone to his wife, former Councilwoman Cathy Jolly, who was a champion of the project during her time in office.\n\n\u201cCathy put her heart and soul into this bridge,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nJolly acknowledged that throughout the planning and design process, there were some residents who didn\u2019t like the direction it was going. They felt it destroyed the rural character of their neighborhoods. But many others were enthusiastic about the need for a new bridge, Jolly said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say this bridge was controversial,\u201d Jolly said.\n\nKlein agreed, and spoke of numerous public meetings about the issue, some of which were occasionally contentious.\n\n\u201cThis bridge has had more public input than any bridge in the city, trust me,\u201d Klein said.\n\nJolly said the fact that the bridge opened, however, speaks to the forces that pull the communities of South Kansas City together.\n\n\u201cIt took a lot of commitment and a lot of compromise to get to this point,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re a close community and we have a lot to celebrate.\u201d\n\nFriday, November 18, 2011\n\nFamilies seeking services can do so over the phone and at other area offices\n\nKansas City, Mo. \u2013 The Missouri Department of Social Services\u2019 South Jackson County Child Support Enforcement Office, located at 8800 Blue Ridge, is closed temporarily due to electrical problems identified by building inspectors with the Kansas City Fire Department.\n\n\u201cWe apologize in advance for any inconvenience this temporary closure may cause our clients. Impacted staff will relocate to other areas offices to ensure that we continue to offer child support services in Jackson County without interruption,\u201d said Seth Bundy, Missouri Department of Social Services spokesperson. \u201cMeanwhile, we appreciate the work of the Kansas City Fire Department to ensure that our employees and the families we serve are kept safe, and that a potentially dangerous situation was avoided,\u201d\n\nParents who would normally access child support services at the South Jackson County Office can do so by either visiting the next-nearest office, or calling the toll-free customer service center at 1-866-313-9960.\n\nOn the afternoon of Thursday, November 17, the Kansas City Fire Department determined that a water leak inside the office at 8800 Blue Ridge was causing an electrical short, which posed a risk of fire. This location will reopen after this issue has been permanently fixed, and the building is again inspected by fire department officials.\n\nThursday, November 17, 2011\n\nAlec Burks, Grandview High School alumnus, and National Basketball Association star for the Utah Jazz, will receive a proclamation on Tuesday, November 22, at 7:00 p.m. in the Grandview City Hall during the Board of Aldermen meeting, declaring Wednesday, November 23, as \u201cAlec Burks Day\u201d. The proclamation will be presented to Burks for his outstanding athletic accomplishments in basketball. Burkswas recently selected by the Utah Jazz in the first round (12th overall) of the National Basketball Association 2011 Draft, thus becoming the first Grandview High School athlete to ever play in the NBA.\n\nDuring his years at Grandview High School, he was named the 2009 Gatorade Player of the Year in the State of Missouri as a senior, while averaging 23.0 points, 6.8 rebounds, 3.0 assists and 1.6 steals per game. Burks scored 33 points and had 13 rebounds while leading Grandview to runner-up in the Missouri Class 5A state championships; He also named the Kansas City Star and Metro Sports Player of the Year as the top player in the Kansas City metro area; In addition, he earned First Team All-Suburban Six League honors.\n\nDuring his two seasons as a guard at the University of Colorado, Burks also broke numerous school records, including most points scored in a single season (779), most points scored by a sophomore (779), most points scored in a season by a guard (779), most free throws made in a season (249), most free throw attempts in a season (302) and first player with at least 500 points (779), 200 rebounds (247), 100 assists (112) in a single season.\n\nBurks earned honorable mention 2010 \u2013 2011 All-America honors from the Associated Press. He was awarded Andy Katz National Player of the Week for the week of February 21, 2011 to February 27, 2011. He was named to the Big XII Conference First Team and to the National Invitational Tournament All-Tournament Team. He was a Top-20 list finalist for the John R. Wooden Award. He was also part of the Lute Olson All-American Team, Big 12 Basketball Championships All-Tournament Team, and was named Big XII Conference 2009 \u2013 2010 Freshman of the Year.\n\nTuesday, November 15, 2011\n\nGrandview's beloved, unofficial mascot--Ebenezer the Donkey--is once again facing some challenges that his caretakers hope he can overcome with a little help from his friends.\n\nIf you have missed seeing the donkey trotting around his tree-covered lot on the west side of Grandview's Main Street this summer and fall, there is a reason.\n\n\"In May, Ebenezer started having issues with arthritis on the stifle joint and the howk joint,\" caretaker Shirley Phillips explained. To get up off the ground, the donkey had to be picked up using furniture straps over the course of several months.\n\nAn injection of an amino acid has helped Ebenezer once again get up on his own. However, the donkey needs to have the shot every two weeks for the rest of his life.\n\n\"We don't want to put him down because he's still really healthy besides the joints not working as well as they used to,\" Phillips said.\n\nFriends and fans of the donkey can help in several ways.\n\nA 2012 Ebenezer calendar is now on sale for $17 at May Milling, 606 Main Street, in downtown Grandview. The calendar features photos of the donkey showing his lively spirit, dressed in everything from his winter coat, to a variety of holiday-related hats each month. All proceeds will go toward Ebenezer's continued care.\n\n\"The 12 month calendar that has been put together is by George Gross, a professional photographer that is smitten with Ebenezer just like the rest of us,\" explained Joe Dimino, who administers the donkey's website. \"This is a must for all fans of Ebenezer.\"\n\nThose who wish to purchase the calendar online can do so as well. Visit www.ebenezerthedonkey.com and click on the Shutterfly link to purchase the calendar.\n\nEbenezer's new veterinarian has also agreed to accept donations for the donkey's medical care. The Koch-Stigge Veterinary Clinic can be reached at (816) 380-1990, or by mail at 28204 Southwest Outer Road, Harrisonville, MO 64701.\n\nFriday, November 11, 2011\n\nHillcrest Country Club was scheduled for sale at public auction today, but a last-minute bankruptcy filing gives the owners more time to restructure, according to attorneys. Photo by Paul Thompson\n\nThe Hillcrest Country Club came only a day away this week from being sold in a foreclosure auction. The auction had been scheduled for Friday, November 11 at 2 p.m., but a last minute filing on Thursday led to the auction\u2019s cancellation.\n\nAccording to the group\u2019s lawyer, Tim West of the Berkowitz Oliver law firm, Heartland Golf Development II, LLC filed for bankruptcy protection on Thursday to put off the sale.\n\n\u201cThe foreclosure sale scheduled originally for tomorrow at 2:00 pm at the Jackson County Courthouse is off because the entity that owns Hillcrest, Heartland Golf Development II, LLC, filed for bankruptcy protection today,\u201d said West in a phone message. \u201cSo that will obviously put the foreclosure sale off until they go through a restructuring process.\u201d\n\nFor further details as the story develops, please refer back to jcadvocate.com.\n\nWednesday, November 9, 2011\n\nNew animal exhibits and additional employees are in the KC Zoo\u2019s future.\n\nJackson and Clay County voters on Tuesday passed an 1/8th-cent retail sales tax to help fund improvements at the Kansas City Zoo. In Jackson County, the issue was approved by 70%.\n\nThe tax will mean an additional penny for every $8 in taxable purchases in both counties, and is expected to fund more than 100 new permanent jobs, in addition to construction jobs.\n\nThe funds will pay for a Penguin Exhibit, Predator Canyon/Tiger Exhibit, new Kid\u2019s Wet Play Zone, a Gorilla/Ape Exhibit, Orangutan Canopy, a Giraffe Tree Tops viewing area, a renovated sea lion cove and other projects. It will also expand the zoo\u2019s education program, fully sponsoring science educational field trips for local schools, and creating dedicated \u201cZoomobiles\u201d to bring programming to schools, libraries, community centers and other public places in each county.\n\nJackson County residents will also receive half-price admission to the Zoo, and four free Zoo days per year.\n\nSouth Kansas City residents who are worried about code violations in their neighborhoods can now do something about it other than calling 3-1-1.\n\nThe Volunteer Inspector Program (VIP) is a city program that empowers neighborhoods to hold accountable owners who do not keep their properties up to code. Essentially, the program trains volunteers to notice and document codes violations.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t be everywhere,\u201d said Carla Finch, of the city\u2019s Neighborhood and Community Services department. \u201cYou pretty much know and see what\u2019s going on in your neighborhood, so if you see violations you can let the city know.\u201d\n\nCurrently, residents can call the city\u2019s 3-1-1 service to report codes violations such as weeds, trash, peeling paint, and similar issues. But that can take up to 90 days, Finch said.\n\n\u201cThis is much faster than going through 3-1-1,\u201d Finch said, adding that most violations will be cleaned up in about 10 days after a citizen inspector reports them.\n\nThe way the program works is that neighbors \u2013 ideally a group, such as a homes association \u2013 can call Finch at 513-9039 to set up a training session. An employee of the city\u2019s Neighborhood and Community Services department will schedule a session and come out to train volunteer citizen inspectors.\n\nThe volunteers attend a short training class, where they are informed about how to properly document codes violations.\n\n\u201cWe ask that volunteers ensure they have the correct address, date, and violations documented on a 8.5 by 11 dry erase board or notebook,\u201d said Mike Schumacher, assistant to the director of the Neighborhood and Community Services department. \u201cThe citizen inspector photographs this document and then photographs the property.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s all they\u2019re to do, he said.\n\n\u201cThey are not to leave the sidewalk of the street, and are not authorized to walk around the subject property,\u201d Schumacher cautioned.\n\nThe citizen inspector would then submit those photos to the city, who will notify the property owner of the violation. After 10 days, the violations will be issued to a contractor for cleanup, and the city bills the property owner.\n\nThe citizen inspectors need to provide their own equipment, including cameras.\n\nOrrin Ellis, of the KC Neighborhood Advisory Council, said he\u2019s a big believer in the program.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to get every HOA involved in this,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cIt makes them more self-sufficient and self-reliant in taking care of their own neighborhoods.\u201d\n\nGary Kempf, president of the Terrace Lake Gardens Homes Association, said he hopes people in his area will want to get involved. He said people often don\u2019t like to tattle on their neighbors, but they\u2019re actually performing a service to the community when they do.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not being a busybody when you report codes violations,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact you\u2019re being a responsible citizen.\u201d\n\nApril Cushing, of the Ruskin neighborhoods, was trained in the program last year and said it\u2019s been a big help in getting codes violations cleaned up in a more timely manner.\n\n\u201cThese violations are usually in homes that are owned by absentee landlords,\u201d Cushing said. \u201cThey can drive down everyone else\u2019s property values and give a neighborhood a bad feel.\u201d\n\nFinch urged residents who are interested in setting up a training session to call her office at 513-9039 if they have more questions, or they can email her at carla.finch@kcmo.org.\n\nFriday, November 4, 2011\n\nA new playground at Grandview\u2019s Meadowmere Park has been plagued with delays and will not be finished by the end of October \u2013 a deadline imposed by the Board of Aldermen after an earlier May deadline was missed by the contractor. Now city staff are consulting with legal counsel to see what can be done to get the project finished.\n\nUpdate:The Board of Aldermen at its Nov. 1 work session decided against terminating a contract to build the park, saying it would delay the project even further. Kirk Decker, assistant city administrator, said the contractor believes the park can be completed in mid-December, weather permitting.\n\nCobra Contractors, of Overland Park, in Oct. 2010 was awarded an $896,000 contract for construction of the state-of-the-art playground, designed to resemble a magical forest kingdom. But bad weather slowed construction, which was supposed to be complete in May of this year.\n\n\u201cThe original completion date was May 20,\u201d said Tony Finlay, parks director, \u201cbut the contractor lost 113 days due to weather.\u201d\n\nThat created a domino effect, Finlay said, because Cobra wasn\u2019t ready for sub-contractors when they were scheduled, and at least one sub-contractor didn\u2019t show up for scheduled work.\n\n\u201cOf course we\u2019re extremely disappointed with that,\u201d Finlay said.\n\nThis summer, the Board of Aldermen gave the contractor an extension due to weather delays, asking that the park be finished on Oct. 28.\n\n\u201cProgress has been made since our last notice to the contractor, but it does not appear that the contractor will complete the project by Friday,\u201d said Cory Smith, city administrator. \u201cThe city is very disappointed in the slow progress.\u201d\n\nSmith said the city understands about weather-related construction delays, but that that recent weather has been ideal.\n\n\u201cThe weather has been great for construction over the past two months, and the city is not aware of any viable reasons for delays during that period,\u201d Smith said. \u201cDue to the lack of progress to date, the city cannot provide a completion date at the present time.\u201d\n\nAlderman Jim Crain, who serves as a liaison to the Board of Parks and Recreation, echoed feelings of disappointment and said the city wants to work with the contractor so it doesn\u2019t have to start from square one with a new contract. That could delay the project even further. At this point, he said, the city is exploring its legal options.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll just have to meet with our legal counsel and see where we go from there,\u201d Crain said. Finlay agreed.\n\n\u201cOnce we\u2019re done reviewing our legal options we\u2019ll have a statement,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re doing everything we can to get this done.\u201d\n\nCobra checked out with good references when the city awarded the contract. The contractor has done work for the city before on some public works projects.\n\nSmith said he is hopeful action can occur soon.\n\n\u201cThe city is committed to completing the project and providing a quality project as expeditiously and effectively as possible, given the delays and the current status,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe will try to get everything but landscaping done this fall, before winter, if at all possible.\u201d\n\nCrain said it was possible city workers could complete some of the work.\n\nSmith said it is preferable to complete the project without resorting to litigation, but that option is on the table.\n\n\u201cWith the help of its attorney, the city is exploring ways to bring the project to a conclusion and reviewing the contract for legal options,\u201d Smith said.\n\nThe Board of Aldermen discussed this issue at its November 1st work session.\n\nOn Tuesday, November 8th, residents of Clay and Jackson counties will decide whether to approve an 1/8th-cent retail sales tax to help fund new attractions and improvements at the Kansas City Zoo.\n\nThe funds would help pay for a new Penguin Exhibit, new Predator Canyon/Tiger Exhibit, new Kid\u2019s Wet Play Zone, a Gorilla/Ape Exhibit, Orangutan Canopy, a Giraffe Tree Tops viewing area, a renovated sea lion cove and other projects.\n\nIt would also expand the zoo\u2019s education program, fully sponsoring science educational field trips for local schools, and creating dedicated \u201cZoomobiles\u201d to bring programming to schools, libraries, community centers and other public places in each county.\n\nJackson County residents would also receive half-price admission to the Zoo, and four free Zoo days per year.\n\nIf approved, the tax is expected to fund more than 100 new permanent jobs, in addition to construction jobs.\n\nThe tax would mean an additional penny for every $8 in taxable purchases in Jackson County.\n\nPolls will be open from 6am to 7pm Tuesday.
