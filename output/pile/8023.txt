    "text": "Once again we have serious conflict between Israel and Hamas. Hamas fires rockets, Israel fires back. Repeat daily.\n\nIsrael seems to be getting hammered by the U.S. media this time around \u2013 at least from what I have seen on NBC. Formerly very pro-Israel, NBC now seems to be covering the story from the Hamas side; giving heavy play to the destruction and loss of so-called innocent life in Gaza while devoting little airtime to the Israeli point-of-view.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I oppose America\u2019s blind, no-questions-asked support of Israel. It\u2019s a ridiculous policy that has fostered hate against America around the world and has served as a foundation for Israeli bad behavior like building illegal settlements, illegal land appropriation and the flagrant mistreatment of Palestinians.\n\nBut what Palestinians and their supporters around the world need to understand is that their problems are completely and concisely rooted in their staunch determination to destroy Israel and their refusal to recognize Israel\u2019s right to exist. This one thing represents the impediment to peace.\n\nI doubt America\u2019s relationships with Canada or Mexico would be so friendly if they were sworn to our destruction and murder.\n\nSo, America\u2019s blind support of Israel is not even the issue at hand. The issue is Israel\u2019s right to exist and to defend itself against those who seek to destroy it. Hamas has insidiously woven its weaponry and military through the neighborhoods, schools, hospitals and markets of its own people. Of course Israel\u2019s attacks to destroy Hamas\u2019s military capability and weaponry will result in civilian casualties. That was Hamas\u2019s plan from the start along with its plan to use those casualties as propaganda to weaken support for Israel.\n\nBut Israel is not the aggressor here. Israel has been under siege for weeks and has exercised great patience and discipline in its responses to Hamas. The time for patience, however, is ending and Israel must do what it must do \u2013 what we all know it must do.\n\nNBC News and the world media need to stop buying into the Hamas propaganda that Israel is killing innocents. Those so-called innocents are all sworn to annihilate Israel. Those so-called innocents elected Hamas as their leadership and, in doing so, endorsed Hamas\u2019s methods. They are no more innocent than the Germans who elected Hitler and then stood by while he committed the worst genocide in history.\n\nIf the Palestinians truly care for the innocent women and children who are in harm\u2019s way, they have the power to remove Hamas from leadership and denounce the destruction of Israel. If they do that, I am quite confident that Israel will be the first ones to the peace table.\n\n\u201cCall out the National Guard.\u201d \u201cLock down the border.\u201d \u201cNot in our town.\u201d These are just a few of the friendly and heartwarming welcome phrases uttered by the loving Americans in Murrieta, CA this week in protest of illegal immigrants being brought to the border patrol facility located there. The buses carrying the immigrants were turned away by the angry mob; another proud American moment destined to be inducted into the American Hypocrisy Hall of Fame. It will look terrific right next to the Cliven Bundy statue. \u201cWhere is the AHHoF,\u201d you ask? It\u2019s located in Washington, D.C. right at the intersection of Constitution Ave. and Independence Ave.\n\nWell, actually Constitution and Independence don\u2019t intersect in Washington; and they don\u2019t seem to intersect in Murrieta either. Except for a handful of Native Americans in Murrieta, everyone there is either an immigrant or descended from immigrants. It\u2019s an interesting human quirk that we feel entitled to the things we need while simultaneously oppressing others with the same needs. It was ok for my ancestors to flee poverty and oppression in search of a better life in America, but it\u2019s not ok for today\u2019s oppressed to do the same.\n\nAmerican\u2019s have been historically schizophrenic about immigration. On one hand, we love to hold ourselves out as the great beacon of hope; erecting statues and enshrining poems that solicit the world to send us its tired, poor and homeless. On the other hand, when said tired, poor and homeless take us up on our offer, we work zealously to repel them and treat them badly while doing so. At best it\u2019s false advertising; at worst it\u2019s just plain inhumane.\n\nThe good folk in Murrieta are quick to point out that this is not about immigration, but rather illegal immigration. But, the nuances and legalities of American immigration policy may not weigh strongly on the mind of a Honduran mother whose survival instinct is to flee with her children \u2013 just as mothers have done since the dawn of humankind. And if respecting the law was the message of the Murrieta mob, they might consider the laws they violated while refusing to let those buses pass.\n\nIt\u2019s true, America\u2019s immigration policy is a shameful patchwork of conflicting, politically-motivated, discriminatory laws and rules that place bigotry, greed and fear above human compassion. Consider that, in South Florida, a Cuban refugee and a Haitian refugee both arrive near the shoreline on the same raft. The police are waiting on the beach to repel them. The two refugee\u2019s jump off the raft and swim in to shore, trying desperately to dodge the police officers. Through sheer determination, both get past the police and then collapse on the beach \u2013 exhausted. The Cuban is welcomed and released into the country. The Haitian is deported. How is that fair?\n\nI understand the anger of the ignorant mob in Murrieta, but I don\u2019t understand why they are directing their anger at these poor, tired, homeless people; you know, the ones mentioned in the poem by Emma Lazarus on the Statue of Liberty. America has invited these people to come. It is disingenuous and un-American to treat them like invaders. If the people of Murrieta don\u2019t want them, then perhaps the people of Murrieta should make a journey of their own. They could start by hopping on some buses to the Statue of Liberty to take down the damn poem that is causing all the problems. They could even put up a new plaque of their own. It could read: NO TRESPASSING. WE HATE YOU. STAY THE HELL OUT!\n\nOr, they could travel to Washington DC and direct their anger at the Congress whose politics and petty differences are responsible for an immigration system that mistreats immigrants and places undue hardship on border communities and states. One thing is certain: We\u2019re not going to solve the immigration issue by hating immigrants.\n\nSo, the kids are out of school and getting restless and the hot weather has got you looking for something to do that\u2019s cool. It may be time to grab a cool drink, a tub of popcorn and settle in for a great movie! Here\u2019s a list of the best Movies of 2014\u2026so far.\n\nIn HBO\u2019s new series, Silicon Valley, quirky billionaire Peter Gregory (played by the late Christopher Evan Welch) tries to convince college students to drop out of school with a promise of $100,000 to pursue their own ideas. The show is a comedy, but Gregory\u2019s message is painfully close to reality. College students are graduating in greater numbers than ever, with higher debt than ever and with fewer job options than ever. They are going to college seeking the American Dream and are instead graduating into an economic mess.\n\nCollege is a given for the wealthy in America but, for the poor and working class, obtaining a college education is a struggle. There was a time when college was worth the sacrifice because it was a ticket out of poverty; it meant being able to get a better job and live a better life. Going to college became one of the great pillars of the American Dream and, for working class families, it was a symbol of success and achievement. Generations of parents worked hard and sacrificed in order to see their children have that better life.\n\nYes, college is still worth the sacrifice; it\u2019s just that nowadays, it takes a lot more sacrificing. Decades ago, politicians began to see college education as a means to get votes among the working class. In campaign after campaign they promised tuition assistance, grants and low-cost loans \u2013 popular items that helped seduce votes from parents who wanted better futures for their children. Before then, banks had never viewed college education as a cash cow because the rich didn\u2019t need to borrow to send their kids to school. But, as the ranks of poor and working class students swelled over the years, the banking industry began to see opportunities. Using well-funded lobbyists, the banking industry pushed Congress for reductions in government funding and increases in private, government-backed student loans. For the banks, it was a win-win scenario; they made money on interest and were exposed to little risk. The lobbying didn\u2019t stop there however. During the 1980\u2019s and 1990\u2019s the banking industry pressured Congress to pass legislation preventing student loans from being discharged in personal bankruptcies.\n\nThe banking industry however, is not alone in this student loan shakedown. Colleges themselves are complicit too. During the last 40 years, the message that college is required for success has been steadily hammered into the American consciousness while, during that same time, the average cost of college tuition has risen by 1,120% according to Bloomberg News. CNN Money says that the average college graduate today is about $30,000 in debt. The impact of this enormous debt will have far-reaching consequences as graduates begin their adult lives and careers. Even with the better job that a college degree may deliver, most graduates will find it financially daunting to get married, buy a home, buy cars, have children, and save for retirement which, ironically, are many of the key attributes associated with achieving the American Dream.\n\nAdditionally, the U.S. birthrate has been declining for decades and, with so much student loan debt, millions of graduates are expected to put off starting families for years while they struggle to pay bills; a trend that will have a devastating impact on the Social Security system since fewer and fewer people will be paying into it.\n\nWinning the lottery aside, the only financial relief for many graduates may come from inheriting their parents\u2019 estates when they depart. But, not so fast; banks have set their sights on these too. In recent years, the banking industry has ramped up one of its newer money-making schemes: \u201creverse mortgages.\u201d A reverse mortgage allows retirees to borrow the equity out of their homes and use it to pay bills. In exchange, the bank owns the home when they die. Yes, the banks are now offering to lend your parents their own equity so, when they are gone, their home won\u2019t go to the kids, it will have already been signed over to the bank.\n\nSo what is a student to do in this depressing and bleak landscape? If you\u2019re determined to go to college and pursue the American Dream, here\u2019s a few real-world tips that may help you avoid the student loan swindle:\n\nChoose a school that gives the most education bang for the buck. Yes, big name schools can be more fun, but if your goal is to have fun, go to Disney World. If you want an education, pick a school that will provide you with an education that doesn\u2019t cost an arm and a leg. In many areas of study, your local community college can deliver the same education as a big box school at half the price! And, if you\u2019re worried about prestige, don\u2019t be. Most employers want legit degrees but seldom care what school they are from.\n\nConsider a regionally accredited online school. They\u2019re not for everyone and require extra discipline however, if you have the discipline to do it, attending online is far more flexible and will allow you the time to work and earn money to help keep student loans at a minimum.\n\nLive at home if possible. Avoiding the cost of housing will help keep your borrowing down.\n\nWork. Get some kind of job and put as much money toward your tuition as you can. Every dollar you pay up front will probably save you two dollars or more in student loan payments later. Plus, the experience you get from working a job will be invaluable no matter what your career field is.\n\nPick a major that is employable. You can be idealistic and major in \u201caboriginal interpretations of celestial bodies,\u201d but that may not get you hired at most companies. Choose a major that will get you in the door at the biggest number of companies and chase your ideals as a minor \u2013 or better still \u2013 as a post graduate once you\u2019re already employed.\n\nAvoid other debt. Banks are not your friends! Throw those credit card offers in the trash and don\u2019t make any major purchases \u2013 like a car. You are already making a major purchase \u2013 college!\n\nLook for scholarships and grants \u2013 but don\u2019t be afraid to beg also! Ask friends and relatives, but be creative too. Go to Wal-Mart and buy 12 cheap 8\u201d x 10\u201d picture frames. Insert your picture with a strip across the bottom that reads \u201cThis establishment is proudly helping \u2013your name here- with college tuition.\u201d Now, go around to all the mom and pop businesses in your area and ask if they will gift $100 to help you pay for school. You\u2019ll be surprised at how many may agree. Give them your portrait and let them display it where customers can see it. If they are suspicious, have them make the check payable directly to the school. Businesses love supporting good causes \u2013 especially when they get promotional value out of it. It\u2019s a win-win! Stay in touch with them as your education continues. Show them your grades. They are likely to make an additional gift each year if you keep them up-to-date on your success."
