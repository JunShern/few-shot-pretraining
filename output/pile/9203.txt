The\nstatute authorizes the President to secure expedited delivery of materials\nprocured for the military forces of the United States. It also contains a\nprovision added in 1973 that would enable one House of Congress to disap\u00ad\nprove contracts of more than twenty-five million dollars. We conclude that\nthe unconstitutional legislative veto is severable from the statute\u2019s grant of\nauthority to the President to obtain expedited delivery of military contracts.\nWe further conclude that the better view, under the unsettled authority, is\nthat the portion of the statute added by the 1973 amendment constitutes the\nprovision that must be severed from the statute.\n\n                                                 I.\n\n\n   Section 18(a) of the Selective Service Act of 1948 provides:\n\n           Whenever the President after consultation with and receiv\u00ad\n         ing advice from the National Security Resources Board\n         determines that it is in the interest of the national security for\n         the Government to obtain prompt delivery of any articles or\n         materials the procurement of which has been authorized by\n         the Congress exclusively for the use of the armed forces of\n\n                                                49\n\f        the United States, or for the use o f the Atomic Energy Com\u00ad\n        mission, he is authorized, through the head o f any Government\n        agency, to place with any person operating a plant, mine, or\n        other facility capable of producing such articles or materials\n        an order for such quantity of such articles or materials as the\n        President deems appropriate, except that no order which re\u00ad\n        quires payments thereunder in excess of $25,000,000 shall be\n        placed with any person unless the Committees on Armed Ser\u00ad\n        vices of the Senate and the House of Representatives have\n        been notified in writing of such proposed order and 60 days\n        of continuous session of Congress have expired following the\n        date on which such notice was transmitted to such Commit\u00ad\n        tees and neither House of Congress has adopted, within such\n        60-day period, a resolution disapproving such order.\n\n50 U.S.C. app. \u00a7 468(a). Section 18(b) of the Act directs contractors to give\nprecedence to orders placed pursuant to the statute. 50 U.S.C. app. \u00a7 468(a).\nThe statute did not contain a legislative veto as originally enacted. Congress\nadded the clause in section 18(a) that begins \u201cexcept that no order\u201d in 1973.\nSee Department of Defense Appropriation Authorization Act, 1974, Pub. L.\nNo. 93-155, \u00a7 807(d)(1), 87 Stat. 605, 616 (1973).\n\n                                      II.\n\n   The provision authorizing one House of Congress to disapprove an order\nof more than twenty-five million dollars is unconstitutional. Immigration\nand N aturalization Service v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919 (1983). Chadha states\nthat congressional \u201caction that ha[s] the purpose and effect of altering the\nlegal rights, duties, and relations of persons . . . outside the Legislative\nBranch,\u201d id. at 952, must comply with the constitutional requirements of\npassage by both Houses of Congress and presentment to the President for\napproval or veto. U.S. Const, art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 7. The resolution of disapproval\nauthorized by the 1973 addition to section 18(a) authorizes one House of\nCongress to limit the President\u2019s legal powers. The congressional disap\u00ad\nproval mechanism, therefore, may not constitutionally be employed.\n\n\n                                     III.\n\n                                      A.\n   The next question is whether the legislative veto may be severed from the\nremaining provisions of the statute that grant the President authority to order\narticles and materials on an expedited basis. The Supreme Court has de\u00ad\ncided the severability of a legislative veto provision on two occasions. See\n\n                                      50\n\fAlaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock, 480 U.S. 678 (1987); Chadha, 462 U.S. at\n931-35. Both cases employ the standard test for severability questions:\n\u201cUnless it is evident that the Legislature would not have enacted those pro\u00ad\nvisions which are within its power, independently of that which is not, the\ninvalid part may be dropped if what is left is fully operative as a law.\u201d\nAlaska Airlines, 480 U.S. at 684; Chadha, 462 U.S. at 931-32.1 Writing\nwith specific reference to legislative vetoes, the Court in Alaska Airlines\nemphasized that \u201c [t]he more relevant inquiry in evaluating severability is\nwhether the statute will function in a manner consistent with the intent of\nCongress.\u201d 480 U.S. at 685. Additionally, unconstitutional provisions are\npresumed to be severable from the remainder of a statute. See Regan v.\nTime, Inc., 468 U.S. 641, 653 (1984) (plurality opinion). Finally, unconsti\u00ad\ntutional provisions are further presumed to be severable if they are contained\nin a statute that includes a severability clause. See, e.g., Alaska Airlines,\n480 U.S. at 686; Chadha, 462 U.S. at 932. The absence of such a clause,\nhowever, does not give rise to a presumption against severability. See Alaska\nAirlines, 480 U.S. at 686.2\n    The grant of authority to the President in section 18(a) would remain\nfully operative as a law if the congressional disapproval language is excised.\nThe language authorizing the President to order materials needed for na\u00ad\ntional security was part of the statute as originally enacted in 1948. It was\nfully operational in its original form. The congressional disapproval mecha\u00ad\nnism was added by Congress in 1973 to provide congressional review o f a\nPresidential decision to place orders over $25,000,000. As the Court ex\u00ad\nplained in Alaska Airlines, provisions of this sort are by their \u201cvery nature . . .\nseparate from the operation of the substantive provisions of a statute,\u201d and do\nnot affect the capacity of the balance of the legislation to function indepen\u00ad\ndently. 480 U.S. at 684-85.\n    Next, the law that results when the legislative veto provision is severed is\nnot one that Congress would not have enacted. See Alaska Airlines, 480\nU.S. at 685 (severance improper where it would produce a statute that Con\u00ad\ngress would not have accepted). O f course, \u201cthe absence of the veto necessarily\nalters the balance of powers between the Legislative and Executive Branches\nof the Federal Government,\u201d Alaska Airlines 480 U.S. at 685, but that is not\nenough to preclude severance. Rather, the appropriate inquiry is whether the\ndelegation to the President of the power to enter into these military contracts is\n\u201cso controversial or so broad that Congress would have been unwilling to make\nthe delegation without a strong oversight mechanism.\u201d Id.\n    There is no reason to believe that Congress would have refused to grant\nthis power. Congress made such a grant in 1948, and added the legislative\nveto provision only in 1973. In this case, then, the proper question is whether\nin 1973 Congress would have repealed the 1948 law if it had known that the\n\n 1 This is the C ourt\u2019s longstanding test for severability. See Champlin Refining Co. v. Corporation\nComm 'n, 286 U.S 2 1 0 ,2 3 4 (1932).\n 2 Neither the 1948 act nor the 1973 amendments include a severability clause.\n\n                                                51\n\flegislative veto provision was impermissible. We are aware of no indication\nthat Congress would have taken such a step, and the legislative history of\nthe 1973 amendment strongly suggests that it would have done no such\nthing. Congress added the legislative veto to the statute in 1973 as one of a\ngroup o f amendments to four statutes giving the President emergency pow\u00ad\ners in an attempt to \u201creassert congressional control over backdoor financing\nof defense contractors.\u201d 119 Cong. Rec. 30,873 (1973) (statement of Sen.\nProxmire). The initial Senate version of the 1973 amendment would have\nprovided that no order over twenty-million dollars could be placed \u201cexcept\nwith the prior approval of the Congress.\u201d Id. at 30,872. The Conference\nCommittee changed this and the other three provisions because \u201c[w]hile the\nHouse conferees were sympathetic to the purposes of the amendment, they\nwere concerned that the language was unduly restrictive and could result in\ndelays on important weapons programs.\u201d H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 588, 93d\nCong., 1st Sess. 44 (1973) (explaining amendment to 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2307). In\nshort, Congress wanted a legislative veto, but not at the price of destroying\nthe President\u2019s authority to act in an emergency. Refusal to sever the legislative\nveto would produce the harsh result Congress was careful to avoid. Accord\u00ad\ningly, the legislative veto may be severed from the remainder of the statute.\n                                                   1.\n   Because of the way in which this statute is phrased, we must determine\nthe proper way in which to sever the unconstitutional provision. The 1973\nam endment reads:\n          except that no order which requires payments thereunder in\n          excess of $25,000,000 shall be placed with any person unless\n          the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House\n          o f Representatives have been notified in writing of such pro\u00ad\n          posed order and 60 days of continuous session of Congress\n          have expired following the date on which such notice was\n          transmitted to such Committees and neither House of Con\u00ad\n          gress has adopted, within such 60-day period, a resolution\n          disapproving such order.\n50 U.S.C. app. \u00a7 468(a). If the entire provision were severed, the statute\nwould return to the form it had when first enacted. The language also\npermits another line of severance. If only the disapproval mechanism \u2014\ni.e., the words \u201cand neither House of Congress has adopted, within such 60-\nday period, a resolution disapproving such order\u201d \u2014 were removed, the\nprovision would in effect be transformed into a report-and-wait requirement.3\n  3 T here is at least one other alternative: severance of the words \"and 60 days of continuous session of\nC ongress have expired following the date on which such notice was transmitted to such Com mittees\nand neither House o f Congress has adopted, within such 60-day period, a resolution disapproving such\norder.\u201d Severance o f this clause would elim inate the sixty-day delay period and the disapproval require\u00ad\nm ent but would preserve the reporting requirement. The C ourt\u2019s decisions, however, lend no support to\nthis choice.\n\n                                                  52\n\f   In order to decide this question, we must identify the portion of the statute\nthat constitutes the unconstitutional legislative veto. Neither Alaska Airlines\nnor Chadha addressed this as a separate issue, although each case in some\nsense decided it, because each case described the statute that would remain\nafter severance. The Court\u2019s unexplained decisions in the two cases point in\nopposite directions: Alaska Airlines supports severance of the entire provi\u00ad\nsion added in 1973, but Chadha supports the line of severance that would\nleave a report-and-wait requirement. While the existing authorities thus do\nnot provide a certain answer, we believe the better view to be that the entire\nclause added in 1973 constitutes the legislative veto that must be severed\nfrom the valid remainder of the statute.\n   Severance o f the entire provision is supported by textual analysis and by\nAlaska Airlines. First, the legislative veto is most naturally read as a single\nrequirement; it is only an accident of phrasing that makes it possible to\nproduce a report-and-wait procedure by deleting certain words. The require\u00ad\nment of a report to Congress is integral to the operation of the legislative\nveto itself. It gives each House of Congress the notice and information\nneeded to exercise its veto power, and provides a time-table for the one-\nhouse veto procedure. Without these, the legislative veto could not function,\nbut they have no independent importance. There is therefore no reason to\ngive the notification rule any independent status. Nothing in the legislative\nhistory demonstrates any perception of separate requirements for reporting,\nwaiting, and disapproval. Instead, Congress seemingly viewed the entire\nclause as indivisible, with the reporting requirement and the sixty-day delay\nperiod operating only to facilitate the exercise of the disapproval power.\nThe 1973 amendment therefore would not operate in the manner that Con\u00ad\ngress intended if only the disapproval mechanism is removed from the statute.\n   Alaska A irlines , in which the Supreme Court most recently considered\nquestions of severability in depth, reinforces this conclusion. The statute at\nissue in that case authorizes the Secretary of Labor to issue regulations for\nthe administration of an airline employee protection program. 49 U.S.C.\napp. \u00a7 1552(0(1)- The statute further provides:\n\n         The Secretary shall not issue any rule or regulation as a final\n       rule or regulation under this section until 30 legislative days\n       after it has been submitted to the Committee on Commerce,\n       Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee\n       on Public Works and Transportation of the House of Repre\u00ad\n       sentatives. Any rule or regulation issued by the Secretary\n       under this section as a final rule or regulation shall be submit\u00ad\n       ted to the Congress and shall become effective 60 legislative\n       days after the date of such submission, unless during that 60-\n       day period either House adopts a resolution stating that that\n       House disapproves such rules or regulations, except that such\n       rules or regulations may become effective on the date, during\n                                      53\n\f          such 60-day period, that a resolution has been adopted by both\n          Houses stating that the Congress approves o f them.\n\n49 U.S.C. app. \u00a7 1552(f)(3). The Court characterized the entire second\nsentence o f this subsection as the \u201clegislative-veto provision which gave rise\nto this litigation,\u201d 480 U.S. at 682, and severed that provision from the rest\nof the statute. Likewise, the legislative veto provision added to the Selective\nService Act in 1973 has the same three components: a report requirement, a\nwait requirement, and a disapproval mechanism. According to the opinion\nin A laska A irlines, those provisions together constitute the legislative veto\nand should be treated as a unit for purposes of severance.\n    W hile we take some guidance from Alaska Airlines, we do not suggest\nthat the case is dispositive. For one thing, the disputed question in that case\nwas whether the regulatory authority the statute gives to the Secretary of\nTransportation survived the invalidation of the legislative veto. Once the\nCourt determined that the legislative veto could be severed from the grant of\nauthority to issue regulations, the Court did not have to decide what the\n\u201clegislative veto\u201d was. Also, the statute at issue in Alaska Airlines already\ncontains a report-and-wait requirement (the first sentence of 49 U.S.C. app.\n\u00a7 1552(0(3)) distinct from the provision the Court severed (the second sen\u00ad\ntence of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1552(0(3)). Thus, severance did not eliminate all\nstatutorily-mandated congressional oversight, a point the Court made in its\nopinion. See 480 U.S. at 689 (\u201cshould Congress object to the regulations\nissued, it retains a mechanism for the expression o f its disapproval that re\u00ad\nduces any disruption of congressional oversight caused by severance of the\nveto provision\u201d). By contrast, severance of the entire provision added to\nsection 18(a) of the Selective Service Act in 1973 would eliminate any statu\u00ad\ntory oversight procedure.\n   Severance of the disapproval mechanism alone is supported by other\nstrands o f the C ourt\u2019s severability analysis and by the Court\u2019 opinion in\nChadha. Severance of the last clause of the 1973 amendment instead of the\nwhole 1973 amendment results in legislation that Congress might have en\u00ad\nacted. If the purpose of the 1973 amendment was to facilitate congressional\noversight, preservation of a report-and-wait requirement would further this\ngoal, albeit less successfully than the legislative veto Congress drafted.4\nChadha lends some support to this line of severance. In Chadha, the Court\u2019s\nmode of severance removed the congressional disapproval mechanism while\n\n\n\n  4 It also m ight be argued that this line o f severance is most faithful to the Court\u2019s command to \u201crefrain\nfrom invalidating more of the statute than is necessary.\u201d Alaska Airlines, 480 U.S. at 684. We doubt,\nhowever, that the C ourt\u2019s point is to save as many words as possible. Rather, the goal is to preserve\n\u201cunobjectionable provisions separable from those found to be unconstitutional.\u201d Id. at 684 (quoting\nRegan v. Time, Inc., 468 U.S. at 652) (em phasis added). That rule cannot be applied until we have\ndecided w hether the words that would produce a report-and-wait procedure constitute a separate \u201cpro\u00ad\nvision.\"\n                                                    54\n\fleaving a report-and-wait requirement.5 Application of this technique to sec\u00ad\ntion 18(a) of the Selective Service Act would eliminate the congressional\ndisapproval mechanism but preserve the rest of the section, thus effectively\ncreating a report-and-wait requirement.\n    Chadha , however, can be distinguished from the situation we confront\nhere. The history of the Immigration and Nationality Act indicates that\nCongress sought to confer substantial power on the Attorney General but\nalso to retain some active role in the deportation process, whether or not that\nrole involved the specific legislative veto in force at the time of Chadha.6\nThe Court concluded on the basis of this history that the legislative veto was\nseverable because Congress would not have simply returned to the private-\nbill system had it known the one-house veto to be impermissible. 462 U.S.\nat 934. The history also supported the conclusion that Congress was deter\u00ad\nmined to retain an active role, and thus accorded with the Court\u2019s decision\nto sever the legislative veto so as to produce a report-and-wait mechanism.\nThere is no similar evidence concerning the 1973 amendment to the Selec^\ntive Service Act. Congress had not tinkered with the relative powers of the\ntwo branches and gave no indication that it had any strong separate interest\nin being involved in the decision if the legislative veto was unavailable.\nUnder these circumstances, to change the legislative veto into a report-and-\nwait mechanism would represent a rewriting of the statute based on nothing\nmore than speculation as to Congress\u2019s probable preferences. The C ourt\u2019s\napproach in Alaska Airlines avoids these difficulties.\n    To the extent the two cases are in tension, Alaska Airlines is authoritative,\nboth because it is more recent and because it deals with severability in\ngreater detail and therefore is more likely to represent the Court\u2019s consid\u00ad\nered judgment on the matter. The outcome in Alaska Airlines may represent\na judgment (or at least an intuition) by the Court that the severance of entire\nlegislative-veto mechanisms is less likely to produce statutes that Congress\nwould never have written than is the speculative process of removing the portion\nof a single mechanism that seems to contain the legislative veto in isolation.\n\n\n  5 The legislative veto appeared in section 244(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. A.\n\u00a7 1254(c) (1970), which has since been amended, see 8 U S C. \u00a7 1254(c) Section 244(c)(1) of the Act\nrequired the Attorney General to report to Congress when he suspends the deportation o f an alien. 8\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1254(c)(1) (1970). Section 244(c)(2) of the Act provided.\n      [T]f during the session of the Congress at which a case is reported, or prior to the close of the\n      session o f the Congress next following the session at which a case is reported, either the\n      Senate or the House o f Representatives passes a resolution stating in substance that it does\n      not favor the suspension of such deportation, the Attorney General shall thereupon deport\n      such alien or authorize the alien\u2019s voluntary departure at his own expense under the order of\n      deportation in the manner provided by law. If, within the time above specified, neither the\n      Senate nor the House of Representatives shall pass such a resolution, the Attorney General\n      shall cancel deportation proceedings.\n8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(c)(2) (1970). Thus, the first subsection contained a report requirement, and the second\nsubsection contained both a wait requirement and a disapproval mechanism In Chadha the Court ex\u00ad\ncised the disapproval mechanism but retained the wait requirement contained in the sam e subsection,\nobserving that \u201c [wjithout the one-House veto, \u00a7 244 resembles the \u2018report and w ait\u2019 provision approved\nby the Court in Sibbach v. Wilson <6 Co., 312 U.S. 1 (1941).\u201d 462 U.S. at 935 n.9.\n\n                                                 55\n\f                                        CONCLUSION\n\n   In sum, the one-House veto clause added to section 18(a) of the Selective\nService Act in 1973 is unconstitutional. The legislative veto is severable\nfrom the remainder of the section 18(a). Under the best understanding of\nthe Supreme Court\u2019s approach to severability, the 1973 amendment should\nbe severed in its entirety, thus returning the statute to the form it had when\noriginally adopted in 1948. As a matter of comity, however, you may wish to\ninform Congress of a contract of more than twenty-five million dollars. More\u00ad\nover, depending on the urgency of the situation, you may wish to allow Congress\ntime to decide if it wants to take legislative action concerning a contract.\n\n                                                            JOHN C.

In 1940, Congress authorized the Attorney General to\nsuspend deportations but provided that Congress could overrule a suspension by a concurrent resolution.\nId. at 933-34.
