PuTTY also supports some terminal control sequences not supported by the real xterm: notably the Linux console sequences that reconfigure the colour palette, and the title bar control sequences used by DECterm (which are different from the xterm ones; PuTTY supports both).\n\nBy default, PuTTY announces its terminal type to the server as xterm. If you have a problem with this, you can reconfigure it to say something else; vt220 might help if you have trouble.\n\nDepending on the protocol used for the current session, there may be a submenu of \u2018special commands\u2019. These are protocol-specific tokens, such as a \u2018break\u2019 signal, that can be sent down a connection in addition to normal data. Their precise effect is usually up to the server. Currently only Telnet and SSH have special commands.\n\nThe following special commands are available in Telnet:\n\n* Are You There\n* Break\n* Synch\n* Erase Character\n\nPuTTY can also be configured to send this when the Backspace key is pressed; see section 4.16.3.\n* Erase Line\n* Go Ahead\n* No Operation"
