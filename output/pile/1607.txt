Everything was great until I needed to stop VM and reboot my PC. After that I started my VM again, went to address where YouTrack is based and it took me to \"setUp\" page immediately. What might be the reason for that? Am I loading it incorrectly? Why did it reset and began everything from the start?\nThank you for help.\n\nA:\n\nWhat OS do you use? How do you Start Tomcat?\nMost likely after restart Tomcat is running from the system service or different user account and therefore is using the blank database (since database is specific to the user account).\nYou need to ensure that Tomcat is always running from the same user account and there are read/write permissions for the directory where YouTrack stores its data.\n\n"
