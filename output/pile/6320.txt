Suppose that they have no common factors. Is it true that their Jacobian\n$$J(f,g)=\\begin{bmatrix}\\partial_x f & \\partial_y f\\\\\\partial_x g & \\partial_y g\\end{bmatrix}$$ is invertible at $(0,0)$?\nTypical example would be $f(x,y)=x$ and $g(x,y)=y$.\nA one-dimensional analogue seems to be that if two polynomials have no common factors, they are linearly independent as functions.\n\nA:\n\nNo, that's not true. You can take $f=y-x^2$ and $g=y$, then \n$$\nJ(f,g)=\\left[\\begin{matrix} -2x & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{matrix}\\right]\n$$\nwhich is not invertible at $(0,0)$. The reason is that  the parabola cut out by $f$ and the line cut out by $g$ intersect doubly at the origin, so the resulting point is not a smooth point. \n\n"
