    "text": "I often like the idea of minimalism. Those beautiful Japanese apartments where the few items that are owned are on display in just the right spot. Those amazing eco-homes where everything has a purpose and is responsibly sourced.\n\nBut, then, there are times it makes me shudder. I look at homes like the one in this video and they just look so soulless that I can\u2019t understand how anyone can bear to live there.\n\nSure, he\u2019s happy, and that\u2019s all that counts. I\u2019m not criticising his choices, I\u2019m just saying there is no way I would ever aspire to owning two pieces of underwear and living somewhere with no personality whatsoever.\n\nInspired by this video by Gayle Goddard, I have been thinking a lot about what she said about including \u2018time to reset\u2019 at the end of a task. This involves making sure that the last few minutes of the time you\u2019ve allocated to a task are given to tidying up after it.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re going to do some arts and crafts for half an hour, the last five minutes should be given over to cleaning up and putting things back where they belong.\n\nTo naturally neat people, this is probably just common sense. But for people like me, who gave up trying to have any order in her home for far too long, it feels a bit like a revelation.\n\nOften, it seems pointless (oh hi, overwhelm again!), and yet, if we don\u2019t, things get worse, not better. Progress is not just halted, it\u2019s reversed.\n\nFLYLady. I tried to follow her programme a few years ago but, getting her emails through the day to remind me to do a new task, I found it impossible. It seemed to be designed for people who had nothing to do but wait for her mails and it just didn\u2019t suit someone with other things to do (like work, go out, see friends etc.)\n\nHowever, there is some useful stuff in this video about how and where to start a decluttering journey. It\u2019s common sense in many ways, but those of us with hoarded houses have to admit that we lack a certain amount of common sense in these areas!! Enjoy."
