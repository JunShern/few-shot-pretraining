In particular, there are a bunch of white male authors it is possible to just about forget you haven\u2019t read if you\u2019ve dated the type of dudes you meet at an n+1 party. Certain books are so central to this type of dude that getting through a relationship \u2014 or even a few dates\u2014constitutes the same level of knowledge of these authors that one might get from actually reading them, and gives you just as much right to hard-earned lifelong knowledge about their books, knowledge that need not ever be fact-checked by actually reading the books themselves (unless, for some reason, you really want to). Presented below, 20 authors on whose work I have involuntarily ended up with a strong opinion due to my unfortunate heterosexuality.\n\n1. Philip Roth: I\u2019ve never read any of Philip Roth\u2019s books, but I have dated enough men who have that I can carry on a decent small-talk conversation about why I don\u2019t like them. (If you would like to achieve this without dating men, you could just read a description of one of Roth\u2019s books, in particular the one in which a man is transformed into a boob). Roth and I live in the same neighborhood, and a friend of mine once ran into him in the local pharmacy, where he was buying hemorrhoid cream or Cialis or something equally embarrassing, and glared at my friend for noticing him. Telling this story, I always imagine Roth holding a box that just says BAD DICK CREAM.\n\nI\u2019m sure the thing I say where I call him \u2018the manic pixie dream girl of American literature\u2019 is probably wrong, but I\u2019m not gonna stop saying it.\n\n2. Kurt Vonnegut: Honestly, I feel pretty guilty that I\u2019ve never finished a Kurt Vonnegut novel, and I\u2019m sure the thing I say where I call him \u201cthe manic pixie dream girl of American literature\u201d is probably wrong, but I\u2019m not gonna stop saying it. Even if it isn\u2019t an accurate description of Vonnegut himself, I stand by it absolutely, and in perpetuity, as a description of every single dude with a tattered copy of Breakfast of Champions on his nightstand.\n\n3. Tom Robbins: On the other hand, I feel pretty guilty that I have ever read any Tom Robbins books.\n\n4. Arthur Miller: I\u2019m sorry about your dad.\n\n5. Jonathan Franzen: Anyone who really, sincerely loves Franzen\u2019s writing has also probably really, sincerely told someone that \u201clearn to code\u201d was the solution to all their problems. The Corrections also contributed to the obsession with the literal and figurative \u201cbig book,\u201d in which the size and weight of a novel directly equals its importance, a concept applied almost exclusively to novels by men.\n\n6. Jonathan Safran Foer: I think the general opinion is that the most Jonathan Jonathan, the Ur-Jonathan, is Franzen, but bear with me here, because it\u2019s actually Foer. Foer is the most successful of the Jonathans, in financial terms, and his personal life is a like a movie about the Brooklyn book world created by the Sex and the City writers\u2019 room. The only thing I know about his recent prose is that scene about the doorknob, which made me unable to have sex for a week after I read a review that excerpted it, which I guess is technically an example of \u201cimpactful\u201d writing.\n\n7. J.D. Salinger: I\u2019ve never read Salinger because I suspect that his books are at least 30% descriptions of ways in which women can be small, but I have read the best thing he ever (inadvertently) produced, which is this tweet. A lot of wonderful people love Salinger, but so do a lot of people whose job seems to be staging their meals on Instagram.\n\n8. Chuck Palahniuk: Fight clubs aren\u2019t real, you aren\u2019t in one. (The less flippant thing I have to say is that the horror of the human body is a deeply important and nearly inexhaustible topic for literature, but it is close to impossible to find a white, male, famous writer whose writing on this subject is anything but a thinly disguised demonstration of violent misogyny, and maybe you should read Angela Carter or Carmen Maria Machado instead.)\n\n9. Charles Bukowski: Alcoholism is a disease, not a personality.\n\n10. John Updike: I\u2019m sure that short story was very sad but also you have never had to have a job.\n\n11. Bret Easton Ellis: I don\u2019t like cocaine which is great because it means I have mostly avoided the people who want to sincerely talk about Bret Easton Ellis. A favorite of dudes hoping their sociopathy will be mistaken for genius; a more obvious favorite of dudes who quit their MFA a year in to go to a second-tier business school. A super-favorite of a guy who doesn\u2019t mention his real estate license is how he actually makes money until you\u2019ve known him for a couple months.\n\n12. Ayn Rand: I\u2019m sorry about your start-up.\n\nOne of the greatest things about getting older is that nobody has tried to talk to me about Jack Kerouac in at least five years.\n\n13. Jack Kerouac: One of the greatest things about getting older is that nobody has tried to talk to me about Jack Kerouac in at least five years.\n\n14. Thomas Pynchon: I\u2019m sorry about your unfinished novel. (I actually love Pynchon and this burn is very self-directed).\n\n15. Norman Mailer: The favorite author of every guy who loves to talk about bar fights but has never been in one.\n\n16. Tom Wolfe: The favorite author of every man with an unfinished novel and a \u201cwriting outfit.\u201d\n\n17. Martin Amis: The favorite author of every dude who hates women but loves telling people about the year* he lived* in London. (*three months) (*studied abroad)\n\n18. Donald Barthelme: Barthelme is a beautiful, strange, important writer beloved by dudes who will interrupt two out of every three sentences you say to them.\n\n19. David Foster Wallace: A list like this wouldn\u2019t be complete without DFW, but at the same time his inclusion feels disingenuous, because when it comes to Wallace, I am the literary bro cornering you at a party to ask if you\u2019ve read him and why not. I love DFW\u2019s work in the same over-personal obsessive way this list is meant to mock. Wallace is also an author whose body of work defies the kind of easy summary that can be gleaned from listening to a dude talk at a party about his favorite writer, or applied independent of actual engagement with the writing. I came to his work on my own without the suggestion of any dude, and I\u2019ve probably rhapsodised obnoxiously about his work to most everyone I\u2019ve dated since then. Furthermore, the circumstances of his death render pretty much all of jokes I could make here distasteful. In a better world, DFW would still be alive and we\u2019d all gleefully roast dudes who suddenly start wearing a sweaty bandana to their undergraduate creative writing classes for no reason. The problem with dudes who love DFW, though \u2014 not all of them, certainly, but too many of them \u2014 is that they miss the lesson in his work that\u2019s most useful to the type of person \u2014 like these dudes, and like myself \u2014 who tends toward hero-worship of authors they admire. The things that dudes who aggressively love DFW tend to imitate in DFW\u2019s life and work are the very things that are meant to be openly foolish, interrogative rather than proud, at once offering levity and intense self-skewering criticism. That this enormous vulnerability has been either utterly elided or turned toxic by any of his most fervent fans doesn\u2019t come close to being the greatest tragedy regarding the author, but it\u2019s still immensely regrettable. In unpopular opinions, however, I still think \u201cBig Red Son\u201d is the best essay he ever wrote about America, and I wish he had lived long enough to revise a Large Adult Son joke into it.\n\n20. Ernest Hemingway: The only truly feminist thing I have ever done is never finishing a Hemingway novel."
