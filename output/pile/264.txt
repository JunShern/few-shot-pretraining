How this can be possible? How come tomcat can understand \"grails\" terminology and semantics?\nAm I missing anything over here?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA:\n\nEverything the app needs is in the WAR file that you deploy, including the Grails JARs.  Tomcat merely hosts the app.  It doesn't need to know Grails terminology and semantics.  By the time Tomcat knows about it, it's already been translated into the things it knows: HTTP, HTML, etc.\n\n"
