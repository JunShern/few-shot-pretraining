The relative light output of different particle interactions in CaWO$_4$ is quantified by Quenching Factors (QFs). These are essential for an active background discrimination and the identification of a possible signal induced by weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). We present the first precise measurements of the QFs of O, Ca and W at mK temperatures by irradiating a cryogenic detector with a fast neutron beam. A clear energy dependence of the QFs and a variation between different CaWO$_4$ single crystals were observed for the first time. For typical CRESST detectors the QFs in the region-of-interest (10-40keV) are $QF_O^{ROI}=(11.2{\\pm}0.5)$%, $QF_{Ca}^{ROI}=(5.94{\\pm}0.49)$% and $QF_W^{ROI}=(1.72{\\pm}0.21)$%. The latest CRESST data (run32) is reanalyzed using these fundamentally new results on light quenching in CaWO$_4$ having moderate influence on the WIMP analysis. Their relevance for future CRESST runs and for the clarification of previously published results of direct Dark Matter experiments is emphasized.'\nauthor:\n- 'R. Strauss'\n- 'G. Angloher'\n- 'A.

Well motivated WIMP candidates with masses $m_\\chi$ between a few GeV/$c^2$ and a few TeV/$c^2$ might be detectable via nuclear recoils of few keV in terrestrial experiments [@Lewin:1995rx]. While the DAMA/LIBRA [@Bernabei:2010mq], and recently the CoGeNT [@Aalseth:2010vx], CRESST [@Angloher:2012vn], and the CDMS(Si) [@PhysRevLett.111.251301] experiments observed excess signals that might be interpreted as induced by DM particles with $m_\\chi{\\sim10}$GeV/$c^2$ at WIMP-nucleon cross-sections of ${\\sim}10^{-4}$pb, this scenario is ruled out by the LUX [@Akerib:2013tjd] and XENON100 [@Aprile:2012nq] experiments, and almost excluded by the CDMS(Ge) [@Ahmed:2009zw; @Ahmed:2010wy] and EDELWEISS [@Armengaud:2011cy; @Armengaud:2012pfa] experiments. It is strongly disfavoured by accelerator constraints [@ATLAS:2012ky; @Chatrchyan:2012me] and in mild tension with an extended analysis [@PhysRevD.85.021301] of published CRESST data [@Angloher2009270].\\\nThe CRESST experiment [@Angloher:2012vn] employs scintillating CaWO$_4$ crystals [@edison; @PhysRevB.75.184308] as a multi-element target material. The key feature of a CRESST detector module is the simultaneous measurement of the recoil energy $E_r$ by a particle interaction in the crystal (operated as cryogenic calorimeter at mK temperatures [@Probst:1995fk]) and the corresponding scintillation-light energy $E_l$ by a separate cryogenic light absorber. Since the relative light yield $LY{=}E_l/E_r$ is reduced for highly ionizing particles compared to electron recoils (commonly referred to as quenching) nuclear-recoil events can be discriminated from e$^-$/$\\gamma$ and $\\alpha$ backgrounds. The phenomenological Birks model [@birks1964theory] predicts this quenching effect to be stronger the higher the mass number $A$ of the recoiling ion, which allows to distinguish, in general, between O ($A{\\approx}16$), Ca ($A{\\approx}40$) and W ($A{\\approx}184$) recoils. The expected WIMP-recoil spectrum - assuming coherent scattering - is completely dominated by W-scatters for $m_\\chi\\,\\gtrsim 20$GeV/c$^2$. However, the light targets O and Ca make CRESST detectors particularly sensitive to low-mass WIMPs of $1$GeV$\\,\\lesssim\\, m_\\chi\\,\\lesssim$20GeV. Furthermore, the knowledge of the recoil composition of O, Ca and W allows a test of the assumed $A^2$-dependence of the spin-independent WIMP-nucleon cross-section [@Jungman:1995df]. In addition, background neutrons, which are mainly visible as O-scatters (from kinematics [@scholl_paper]), can be discriminated statistically.\\\nThe mean LY of e$^-$/$\\gamma$ events ($LY_{\\gamma}$) is energy dependent and phenomenologically parametrized as ${LY_{\\gamma}(E_r){=}(p_0+p_1E_r)(1-p_2\\exp(-E_r/p_3)}$ [@strauss_PhD]. By convention, $LY_{\\gamma}$(122keV) is normalized to unity. The parameters $p_{0}$, $p_1$, $p_2$ and $p_3$ are derived from a maximum-likelihood (ML) fit for every detector module individually. For the module used in this work the fit yields: $p_0\\,{=}\\,1.07$, $p_1\\,{=}\\,{-}1.40\\cdot 10^{-5}$keV$^{-1}$, $p_2\\,{=}\\,6.94\\cdot 10^{-2}$ and $p_3\\,{=}\\,147$keV (errors are negligible for the following analysis). The exponential decrease towards lower recoil energies (quantified by $p_2$ and $p_3$) accounts for the scintillator non-proportionality [@Lang:2009uh]. The Quenching Factor (QF) of a nucleus $x$ - in general energy dependent - is defined as $QF_x(E_r)=LY_x(E_r)/LY_{\\gamma,corr}(E_r)$ where $LY_x$ is the mean LY of a nuclear recoil x. For normalization, the LY of e$^{-}$/$\\gamma$ events corrected for the scintillator non-proportionality (which is not observed for nuclear recoils) is used by convention: $LY_{\\gamma,corr}=p_0+p_1E_r$. For typical CRESST detector modules, the uncertainties in energy and LY are well described by gaussians [@Angloher:2012vn] consistent with photon-counting statistics in the energy range considered in this work.\\\nSince the resolution of light-detectors operated in the CRESST setup at present is not sufficient to disentangle O, Ca and W recoils unambiguously, dedicated experiments to measure the QFs of CaWO$_4$ are necessary. Earlier attempts yield inconclusive results, in particular for the value of $QF_W$ [@Jagemann:2006sx; @Ninkovic:2006xy; @Bavykina:2007ze].\\\nAt the accelerator of the Maier-Leibnitz-Laboratorium (MLL) in Garching a dedicated neutron-scattering facility for precision measurements of QFs at mK temperatures was set up (see FIG.\\[fig:setupMLL\\]). A pulsed $^{11}$B beam of ${\\sim}65$MeV in bunches of 2-3ns (FWHM) produces monoenergetic neutrons of ${\\sim}11$MeV via the nuclear reaction p($^{11}$B,n)$^{11}$C in a pressurized H$_2$ target [@Jagemann2005245]. These neutrons are irradiated onto a CRESST-like detector module consisting of a ${\\sim}$10g cylindrical CaWO$_4$ single crystal (20mm in diameter, 5mm in height) and a separated Si light absorber (20mm in diameter, 500$\\mu$m thick) [@Strauss:2012fk]. Both are operated as cryogenic detectors in a dilution refrigerator at ${\\sim}20\\,$mK [@Lanfranchi20091405]. Undergoing elastic (single) nuclear scattering in CaWO$_4$ the neutrons are tagged at a fixed scattering angle $\\Theta$ in an array of 40 liquid-scintillator (EJ301) detectors which allow fast timing (${\\sim}2$ns) and n/$\\gamma$ discrimination. Depending upon which of the three nuclei is hit a distinct amount of energy is deposited by the neutron in the crystal. Triple-coincidences between (1) a $^{11}$B pulse on the H$_2$ target, (2) a neutron pulse in a liquid-scintillator detector and (3) a nuclear-recoil event in the CaWO$_4$ crystal can be extracted from the data set. A neutron time-of-flight (TOF) measurement between neutron production and detection combined with a precise phononic measurement of the energy deposition in the crystal (resolution ${\\sim}1$keV (FWHM)) allows an identification of the recoiling nucleus. To derive the individual QF the corresponding scintillation-light output is measured simultaneously by the light detector. Since the onset uncertainty of cryodetector pulses is large (${\\sim}5\\,\\mu$s) compared to typical neutron TOFs (${\\sim}$50ns) an offline coincidence analysis has to be performed [@strauss_PhD].\\\n\n![Schematic experimental setup of the neutron-scattering facility. Neutrons produced by the accelerator are scattered off a CRESST-like detector module (operated at 20mK) and tagged in liquid-scintillator neutron detectors at a fixed scattering angle $\\Theta$.[]{data-label=\"fig:setupMLL\"}](facility.pdf){width=\"38.00000%\"}\n\nThe experiment was optimized for the measurement of $QF_W$ [@strauss_PhD; @strauss_ltd15]. To enhance the number of W-scatters a scattering angle of ${\\Theta\\,{=}\\,80^\\circ}$ was chosen due to scattering kinematics [@Jagemann:2006sx]. For this specific angle, the expected recoil energy of triple-coincident events is ${\\sim}\\,100$keV for W, ${\\sim}\\,450$keV for Ca, and ${\\sim}\\,1.1$MeV for O . In ${\\sim}\\,3$ weeks of beam time a total of ${\\sim}\\,10^8$ cryodetector pulses were recorded. FIG.\\[fig:timing\\] shows the time difference $\\Delta t$ between neutron events with the correct TOF identified in one of the liquid-scintillator detectors and the closest W-recoil (in time) in the CaWO$_4$ crystal ($E_r=100{\\pm}20$keV). A gaussian peak of triple-coincidences on W (dashed red line) at $\\Delta t\\,{\\approx}\\,0.016$ms and a width of $\\sigma_t\\,{\\approx}\\,4.8\\,\\mu$s (onset resolution of the cryodetector) is observed above a background due to accidental coincidences uniformly distributed in time (shaded area).

The accidental coincidences have a LY-distribution equal to that which is modelled by a probability-density function (background-pdf) [@strauss_PhD]. A simultaneous maximum-likelihood (ML) fit is performed including (1) the timing distribution which fixes the S/B ratio and the number of identified W-events, and (2) the LY distribution described by a gaussian (W-events) and the background-pdf. The final results are $LY_W\\,{=}\\,0.0208\\,{\\pm}\\,0.0024$ and $QF_W\\,{=}\\,(1.96\\,{\\pm}\\,0.22)$%, correspondingly (errors are dominated by statistics).

[]{data-label=\"fig:LY\"}](LY_final.eps){width=\"48.00000%\"}\n\nFor the measurement of $QF_{Ca}$ and $QF_O$ no coincidence signals are necessary, instead, an analysis of the nuclear-recoil data alone is sufficient. Commonly CRESST data is displayed in the energy-LY plane [@Angloher:2012vn] giving rise to nearly horizontal bands which correspond to different types of particle interactions ($LY\\,{\\approx}\\,1$ for electron and $LY\\,{\\lesssim}\\,0.2$ for nuclear recoils). The nuclear-recoil bands of the data recorded during ${\\sim}1$ week of beam time (${\\sim}\\,5\\cdot 10^5$ pulses) are shown in FIG.\\[fig:energyDependence\\] bottom (grey dots). From kinematics using ${\\sim}11$MeV neutrons as probes the O-recoil band extends up to ${\\sim}2.4$MeV while the Ca- and W-bands extend up to ${\\sim}1.05$MeV and ${\\sim}240$keV, respectively [@Jagemann2005245]. Despite the strong overlap of the 3 nuclear-recoil bands the contributions of O and Ca fitted by two gaussians can be disentangled at $E_r\\,{\\gtrsim}\\,350$keV (see FIG.\\[fig:energyDependence\\] top) due to high statistics and a good light-detector resolution. In FIG.\\[fig:qf\\_results\\] the results for $QF_O$ and $QF_{Ca}$ (red error bars) derived by these independent one-dimensional (1-dim) fits are shown for selected recoil-energy slices of 20keV in width. All parameters in the fit are left free except for the LY-resolutions which are fixed by a ML fit of the electron-recoil band [@strauss_PhD]. While $QF_O$ clearly rises towards lower recoil energies, this effect is less pronounced for $QF_{Ca}$.\\\n\n![ Top/Middle: LY histograms of two energy slices at 350 and 40keV (of 20keV in width) fitted by gaussians.

Instead, a correlated ML fit was performed based on the following assumptions: (1) for the mean LY of O- and Ca-scatters the phenomenological parametrization $LY_x(E_r)\\,{=}\\,LY_x^\\infty\\left(1+f_x\\cdot \\exp{(-E_r/\\lambda_x)}\\right)$ is proposed with the free parameters $LY_x^\\infty$ (LY at $E_r\\,{=}\\,\\infty$), $f_x$ (fraction of energy-dependent component) and $\\lambda_x$ (exponential decay with energy), and (2) the mean LY of W-scatters is approximated to be constant in the relevant energy range (up to $\\sim$240keV) at the value precisely measured with the triple-coincidence technique ($LY_W\\,{=}\\,0.0208\\,{\\pm}\\,0.0024$). These assumptions are supported by the result of the 1-dim fits (see FIG.\\[fig:qf\\_results\\]), by Birks\u2019 model [@birks1964theory], and by a recent work [@sabine_phD] which predict the strength of the energy-dependence to decrease with $A$. The nuclear-recoil bands are cut into energy intervals of 10keV (20keV to 1MeV), of 20keV (1MeV to 1.4MeV) and 50keV (above 1.4MeV) and fitted with up to 3 gaussians depending on the recoil energy (e.g., shown in FIG.\\[fig:energyDependence\\] middle for $E_r{=}40$keV). Except for the assumptions mentioned above and the LY-resolution all parameters are left free in the fit. The fit converges over the entire energy range (20-1800keV). In TABLE\\[tab:energydependence\\] the results for $LY_x^\\infty$, $f_x$ and $\\lambda_x$ are presented which correspond, e.g. at 40keV, to $QF_O{=}(12.6{\\pm}0.5)$%, $QF_{Ca}{=}(6.73{\\pm}0.43)$% (here, the errors are dominated by systematics) and $QF_W{=}(1.96{\\pm}0.22)$% at $1\\sigma$ C.L. The 1-$\\sigma$ acceptance bounds of O, Ca and W recoils as obtained in the correlated ML fit are shown in FIG.\\[fig:energyDependence\\] bottom. The final results for $QF_O$, $QF_{Ca}$ and $QF_W$ are presented in and are found to be in perfect agreement with the outcome of the 1-dim fits (red error bars). These are the first experimental results which clearly show a rise of the QFs of O (Ca) of ${\\sim}28$% (${\\sim}6$%) towards the ROI (10-40keV) compared to that at a recoil energy of 500keV.\\\n\n  --------- --------------------- ------------------- ----------------\n  nucleus       $LY_x^\\infty$            $f_x$          $\\lambda_x$\n  O          $0.07908\\pm0.00002$   $0.7088\\pm0.0008$   $567.1\\pm0.9$\n  Ca         $0.05949\\pm0.00078$   $0.1887\\pm0.0022$   $801.3\\pm18.8$\n  --------- --------------------- ------------------- ----------------\n\n  : \\[tab:energydependence\\]Results for the free parameters $LY_x^\\infty$, $f_x$ and $\\lambda_x$ of the ML analysis.

[]{data-label=\"fig:qf_results\"}](bands_v7.eps){width=\"48.00000%\"}\n\nIn previous works, the QFs of CaWO$_4$ were assumed to be constant over the entire energy range [@Angloher:2012vn]. A statistical analysis shows that this simple model is clearly disfavoured. Employing a likelihood-ratio test in combination with Monte-Carlo simulations gives a p-value of $p<10^{-5}$ for the data presented here to be consistent with constant QFs. Furthermore, the derived energy spectra of the individual recoiling nuclei agree with the expectation from incident 11MeV neutrons while the constant QF approach provides non-physical results.\\\nIn the present paper, using the 8 detector modules operated in the last CRESST measurement campaign (run32) an additional aspect was investigated: the variation of the quenching behaviour among *different* CaWO$_4$ crystals [@strauss_PhD]. Nuclear recoils acquired during neutron-calibration campaigns of CRESST run32 are completely dominated by O-scatters at $E_r\\gtrsim 150$keV (from kinematics) [@Angloher:2012vn]. Despite low statistics (a factor of ${\\sim}100$ less compared to the measurement presented here) in the available data, the mean LY of O-events can be determined by a gaussian fit with a precision of $\\mathcal{O}$(1%) for every module. In this way, the mean QF of O between 150 and 200keV was determined individually for the 8 detector modules operated in run32 ($\\overline{QF_O^\\ast}$) and for the reference detector operated at the neutron-scattering facility ($\\overline{QF_O}$). Different values of $\\overline{QF_O^\\ast}$ are observed for the CRESST detector crystals (variation by ${\\sim}11$%) and for the reference crystal (${\\sim}12$% higher than the mean of $\\overline{QF_O^\\ast}$). This variation appears to be correlated with the crystal\u2019s optical quality. The QF - which is a relative quantity - is found to be lower if a crystal has a smaller defect density and thus a higher absolute light output, i.e., the LY of nuclear recoils is less affected by an increased defect density. This is in agreement with the prediction described in a recent work [@sabine_phD]. In the present paper, a simple model to account for this variation is proposed: For every detector module which is to be calibrated a scaling factor $\\epsilon$ is introduced, $\\epsilon\\,{=}\\,\\overline{QF_O^\\ast}/\\overline{QF_O}$. Then, within this model the QFs of the nucleus $x$ can be calculated for every module by $QF_{x}^\\ast(E_r)\\,{=}\\,\\epsilon\\cdot QF_{x}(E_r)$ where $QF_{x}$ is the value precisely measured within this work. The nuclear-recoil behaviour of CRESST modules is well described by energy-dependent QFs. In the QFs, averaged over the ROI (10-40keV), and the scaling factor $\\epsilon$ are listed for two selected detector modules (Rita and Daisy, with the lowest and highest absolute light output, respectively) and the mean of all 8 detector modules of run32 (\u00d8), $QF_O^{ROI}\\,{=}\\,(11.2{\\pm}0.5)$%, $QF_{Ca}^{ROI}\\,{=}\\,(5.94{\\pm}0.49)$% and $QF_W^{ROI}\\,{=}\\,(1.72{\\pm}0.21)$%.\\\n\n  ------- ------------------- -------------------------- ----------------------------- --------------------------\n              $\\epsilon$       $QF_O^\\mathrm{ROI}$\\[%\\]   $QF_{Ca}^\\mathrm{ROI}$\\[%\\]   $QF_W^\\mathrm{ROI}$\\[%\\]\n  Rita     $0.844{\\pm}0.006$        $10.8{\\pm}0.5$              $5.70{\\pm}0.44$             $1.65{\\pm}0.19$\n  Daisy    $0.939{\\pm}0.021$        $12.0{\\pm}0.7$              $6.33{\\pm}0.58$             $1.84{\\pm}0.24$\n  \u00d8        $0.880{\\pm}0.011$        $11.2{\\pm}0.5$              $5.94{\\pm}0.49$             $1.72{\\pm}0.21$\n  ------- ------------------- -------------------------- ----------------------------- --------------------------\n\n  : \\[tab:CRESST\\] QF results averaged over the ROI (10-40keV) and adjusted by the scaling factor $\\epsilon$ for the modules Rita and Daisy, and the mean (\u00d8) of all run32 detectors ($1\\sigma$ errors).\n\nWe now turn to the effect of energy-dependent quenching since constant QFs as assumed in earlier CRESST publications do not sufficiently describe the behaviour of the nuclear-recoil bands. The value of $QF_O$ in the ROI was underestimated by ${\\sim}8$% while the room-temperature measurements overestimated the values of $QF_{Ca}$ and $QF_W$ by ${\\sim}7$% and ${\\sim}130$%, respectively [@Angloher:2012vn]. Therefore, the parameter space of accepted nuclear recoils is larger than assumed in earlier publications (by ${\\sim}46$%) requiring a re-analysis of the published CRESST data.\\\nDuring the latest measuring campaign (run32) a statistically significant signal ($4.2\\sigma$) above known backgrounds was observed. If interpreted as induced by DM particles two WIMP solutions were found [@Angloher:2012vn], e.g. at a mass of $m_\\chi=11.6\\,$GeV/c$^2$ with a WIMP-nucleon cross section of $\\sigma_\\chi=3.7\\cdot10^{-5}$pb. The dedicated ML analysis was repeated using the new QF values ($\\O$ in TABLE\\[tab:CRESST\\]) yielding $m_\\chi=12.0$GeV/c$^2$ and $\\sigma_\\chi=3.2\\cdot10^{-5}$pb at 3.9$\\sigma$. Beside this moderate change of the WIMP parameters also the background composition ($e^-$, $\\gamma$, neutrons, $\\alpha$\u2019s and $^{206}$Pb) is influenced. This is mainly due to the significantly lower value of $QF_W$ which increases the leakage of $^{206}$Pb recoils into the ROI (by ${\\sim}$18%). The other WIMP solution is influenced similarly: $m_\\chi$ changes from 25.3 to 25.5GeV/c$^2$, $\\sigma_\\chi$ from $1.6\\cdot10^{-6}$ to $1.5\\cdot10^{-6}$pb and the significance drops slightly from 4.7 to 4.3$\\sigma$.\\\nIn conclusion, the first precise measurement of $QF_W$ at mK temperatures and under conditions comparable to that of the CRESST experiment was obtained at the neutron-scattering facility in Garching by an extensive triple-coincidence technique. Furthermore, the QFs of all three nuclei in CaWO$_4$ were precisely determined by a dedicated maximum-likelihood analysis over the entire energy range (${\\sim}20{-}1800$keV). The observed energy dependence of the QFs, which is more pronounced for lighter nuclei, has significant influence on the determination of the ROI for DM search with CRESST. The observed variation of the QFs between different CaWO$_4$ crystals is related to the optical quality and can be adapted to every individual crystal by the simple model proposed above. The updated values of the QFs are highly relevant to disentangle the recoil composition (O, Ca and W) of a possible DM signal and, therefore, to determine the WIMP parameters. Since the separation between the O and W recoil bands is higher by ${\\sim}46$% compared to earlier assumptions, background neutrons which are mainly visible as O-scatters [@scholl_paper] can be discriminated more efficiently from possible WIMP-induced events. A reanalysis of the run32 data shows a moderate influence of the new QF values on the WIMP parameters.\\\nThe results obtained here are of importance for the current CRESST run (run33) and upcoming measuring campaigns. Providing a highly improved background level run33 has the potential to clarify the origin of the observed excess signal and to set competitive limits for the spin-independent WIMP-nucleon cross section in the near future. For the planned multi-material DM experiment EURECA (European Underground Rare Event Calorimeter Array) [@Kraus:2011zz] the neutron-scattering facility will be an important tool to investigate the light quenching of alternative target materials in the future.\\\nThis research was supported by the DFG cluster of excellence: \u201cOrigin and Structure of the Universe\u201d, the DFG \u201cTransregio 27: Neutrinos and Beyond\u201d, the \u201cHelmholtz Alliance for Astroparticle Phyiscs\u201d, the \u201cMaier-Leibnitz-Laboratorium\u201d (Garching) and by the BMBF: Project 05A11WOC EURECA-XENON.\n"
