Hints please.\n\nA:\n\nStarting from $a-b=3$, which is odd, this implies the positive primes cannot be  both odd. So one of them is $2$, the other is an odd prime. As $a-b>0$, it's $b$ which is equal to $2$, so $a=3+b=5$, and $a^2+b^2=29$.\n\nA:\n\nPure obfuscation.\nNothing about roots or algebra or the sum of $a^2 + b^2$ are relevant.  That $-1$ is a root simply means $a(-1)^2 + b(-1)-3 = 0$ or in other words $a - b =3$ or $a = b+3$.  \nWhat does matter is that $a,b$ are positive primes and all primes except $2$ are odd. If they were both odd primes then $a -b$ would be an even number.  So one of them is even so one of them is $2$.  So the other is $2+3 = 5$.\nSo $a^2 + b^2 = 29$.\n\n"
