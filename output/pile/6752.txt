    "text": "Flying with Car Seats (+the best travel car seats and boosters)\n\nCar seats. They really are the bane of every traveling family\u2019s existence.\n\nThey\u2019re bulky, heavy, and just plain awkward to move around. They may not even get that much use, yet you really can\u2019t go without them.\n\nIf you\u2019re trying to figure out your own \u201cflying with small kids and car seats\u201d conundrum, just know that you\u2019re definitely not the first, or last, parent to stress over it.\n\nI\u2019ve talked with lots of traveling parents over the years, and over and over again, car seats remain one of the top pain points when it comes to flying with kids. And if you\u2019re a family that likes to travel light? Well, you can just forget it!\n\nBut wait: you do have options when flying with car seats.\n\nSo what can you do? Are you stuck lugging the bulky car seats everywhere you go?\n\nMaybe. But not necessarily.\n\nRead on for our top tips for flying with car seats, plus the best travel car seat and booster options for travel:\n\nDisclaimer: This post contains affiliate links, which may reward us with a small commission if you click them. Thanks for supporting the blog in this way!\n\nThe Best Travel Car Seats for Babies\n\nWhen it comes to babies and car seats, having something versatile makes all the difference. The best options are those that are part of a \u201ctravel system\u201d, meaning they can adapt to a stroller, yet taken out for car rides.\n\nAt this stage, theCosco Scenera Next is the best option for little ones building their frequent flyer miles. This lightweight car seat weighs only X pounds, and is affordable enough that it\u2019s a no-brainer travel investment. It\u2019s so light, we\u2019ve even strapped this car seat to our luggage at times using straps like these, eliminating the need to carry it through the airport separately.\n\nFor a longer-term option that can grow with your child, try the Cosco Finale 2-in-1. Equally as affordable, it works for children 30-65 lbs and 32-49 inches tall with the harness, and children 40-100 lbs and 43-52 inches tall with a seatbelt as a high-back booster.\n\nIs it safe to check a car seat?\n\nWell, it depends on who you ask.\n\nFor us personally, we almost always check our car seats. I hate carrying them through the airport when flying with them, and since you can check it for free on nearly every airline, it\u2019s one less thing to worry about lugging through the airport.\n\nBut on the other hand, I know there are plenty of people who will never check their car seats because of the way they\u2019re handled. For them, it\u2019s not worth the damage the car seat might sustain.\n\nSo I say, to each their own. But no matter which way you decide to go, I recommend getting a quality storage baglike this one to protect your car seat clean and scratch-free.\n\nCan I bring a car seat on the airplane?\n\nAbsolutely! So long as you\u2019ve purchased a seat for your child and the car seat is FAA approved (it should have a sticker on the side stating this), then you can absolutely bring a car seat on the plane. The only caveat is that airlines will have restrictions on the size (it must fit in the seat, after all), so be sure to check ahead with your airline.\n\nHonestly though, we haven\u2019t found bringing the car seat onto the airplane to be worth the trouble, even for a long-haul overseas flight.\n\nManeuvering a big car seat onto a tiny airplane is no fun, and our daughter never sat much better in it than she would right on the seat.\n\nBut for those who have antsy kids that are impossible to keep still, or for special needs kids needing a little extra support, bring the car seat on the plane can be a good option for a sane flight.\n\nBut how do you get your car seat through the airport?\n\nAs I mentioned above, we almost always check our car seat so we don\u2019t have to carry it through the airport. But there are some wonderful products out there to make your life easier if you must!\n\nThe Britax Car Seat Travel Cart is one such piece of travel gear that parents swear by. You can even strap your kid in the seat and roll them along too!\n\nThe Best Travel Booster Seats\n\nOnce your child is old enough for a backless booster (generally around 4 years old), this is where your options really open up. Both the Hiccapop Uberboost Inflatable Booster and Bubble Bum are good options if you plan to spend a lot of time in the car, but are wanting something ultra-portable, as they\u2019re touting as the most comfortable of the travel booster seats for kids.\n\nBut if you\u2019re only needing a booster for a quick, occasional taxi or Uber ride, the MiFold really wins for its compactness. It works by adjusting the car\u2019s seat belt to fit the child, rather than the other way around. It\u2019s downfall though is that it doesn\u2019t have a lot of cushion, so it\u2019s really not ideal for long car rides. And keep in mind, the MiFold is not approved for use in Europe.\n\nWhat about renting car seats? Good or bad idea?\n\nPersonally, we just don\u2019t do it. I\u2019ve heard too many horror stories about rental car seats being dirty, damaged, or just plain not available upon arrival. Plus, I like having a seat I know my girls will be comfortable in. After all, at least checking a car seat is free!\n\nBut can\u2019t I just go without this once? Are car seats really required?\n\nAh, I know, it sure is tempting. And it\u2019s true that in many countries, riding without a car seat is quite common. In some parts of southeast Asia, for example, you might even have a hard time finding a taxi with proper seat belts!\n\nI\u2019ll admit, there have been times where in a pinch we\u2019ve hopped in an Uber without them. It\u2019s not something I\u2019m exactly proud of, and it\u2019s a risk that shouldn\u2019t be taken lightly. Especially when there are so many alternative options out there.\n\nSo if car seats are needed only for a short while, look into booking a family-friendly transfer service. It\u2019s quite easy noawadays to find a company that can offer car seats, some even for free, when booking in advance. There are even some companies, like Family Transfers in Europe, dedicated solely to helping families with this problem!\n\nAnd in many major cities, you can get by just fine solely using public transportation. It\u2019s how we were able to avoid bringing carseats on our latest trip to Europe.\n\nOne thing is certain: flying with car seats is no fun. But if nothing else, find hope in knowing the days of traveling with car seats won\u2019t last forever!\n\nWhat do you do about car seats when you travel? Take them with? Avoid them at all costs? Let me know in the comments below!\n\nComments\n\nas still relatively new to traveling with my own kids, your blog was one of the first \u2013 and best! \u2013 I started following. Thanks for all your great advice.\n\nAs an airline pilot though, I have one hard rule I follow: My kids will NOT fly in a loop belt, acting as a living air bag in case of a take-off or landing mishap. I would probably crush them to death \u2013 one can simply not imagine the forces acting when an aircraft brakes.\nYes, I know, aborted take-offs don\u2019t happen too often. But you still do buckle up yourself, just in case, right?\n\nI know it costs valuable travel money buying a seat for an infant.
