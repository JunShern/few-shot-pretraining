    "text": "Q:\n\nListView+Viewpager Android\n\nI am confused on implementing a design. I have a list of items which I want to show in a ListView. Now what I want to achieve is that the listview would show first 4 items and to view the next set of items, I want to enable view pager instead of vertical scrolling i.e the next set of 4 items should appear on the next page of the view pager.\nSorry, I just want to get a clear picture.\nHow can I achieve this? Thanks.\nEDIT*\nSomething like so if I have a list of 8 items.\n\nA:\n\nLook use a list view. Just show your first fours item as interviewees.\nAnd  then the fifth item of list View will be View Pager. And pass all   the remaining data list after first four elements  to this view Pager Adapter which will show the rest of elements in horizontal scrolling of view Pager. But do not use List View and view pager in a same hierarchy.  This will cause you problem in scrolling and touch events. You can use different views for different items in List View. Better to switch to Recycler View instead of List View. Just have fifth element view a viewPager.\nI hope this will solve your problem. Let me know  if you have any problem in achieving this.\n<*EDIT>\nHey I did some workaround with ViewPager and RecyclerView as you said. Look at the screen Shots below. I hope you want to achieve as same. For Any issue drop a comment. I will try to help you out once I get time. You can find  the source code at https://github.com/MacSimmy/SpannableRecyclerViewExample which is my Github profile.\n\nenter image description here\n\n"
