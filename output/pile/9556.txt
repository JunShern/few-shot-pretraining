    "text": "Monthly Archives: November 2011\n\nNext Wednesday, the identity of the Rubber Man will be revealed, but as a certified American Horror Story addict, I have pondered and watched and re-watched every episode, and I feel quite confident in saying, I know who the Rubber Man is.\n\nThis is the ultimate spoiler, right up there with \u201cWho shot J.R.\u201d and \u201cWho killed Laura Palmer\u201c, so I\u2019m stacking the page with some images from the show . . . This is your last chance to bail out before I let you know who the Rubber Man is.\n\nThe Rubber Man is Satan, he is The Devil Himself.\n\nThe truth of this hit me last night, in a twitter conversation with the high priestess of AHS fandom, Kelsey Y. With over three million viewers each episode, certainly a ton of people are already thinking this (and a google search confirms it) but I can take pride in knowing I got to the conclusion all on my own (with a little help from my friend.)\n\nFirst a few assumptions:\n\nFrom all I can tell, every detail has meaning in this show, there are no red herrings, no attempts to confuse the viewer with false clues, so if it\u2019s in the show, we can make use of it. (One of my favorite details so far \u2013 Tate making mention of the genius of Kurt Cobain. I love Nirvana, but it seemed a little strange that a teen of today would reference a band that peaked 20 years ago. Makes perfect sense a few episodes later when you find out he was killed in the aftermath of his rampage back in 1994.)\n\nThe idea that every detail matters is an important assumption.\n\nGhosts don\u2019t impregnate. This is more of a gut feeling, but while I can imagine a ghost killing, it takes human life to make human life seems a pretty good assumption. It\u2019s a hunch, the theory of Rubber Man as Satan in the living flesh doesn\u2019t depend on it, but this narrowed things down for me and helped me arrive at my conclusion.\n\nBut first, let\u2019s shoot down the two most popular theories:\n\nKnowing that the Rubber Man\u2019s identity was going to be revealed in the next episode, the topic of \u201cWho is the Rubber Man?\u201d blew up all across the Internet over the last week, but I made a conscious decision to avoid all the forums and discussions because I wanted to figure this out for myself. After it hit me and I felt confident I knew who Rubber Man was, I finally felt free to see what other people were saying and I found out that the two most popular suspects for Rubber Man are Tate and Constance, with a healthy dose of people saying it\u2019s a character we\u2019ve yet to meet (*cough* Satan *cough*) but let\u2019s look at the two characters we can identify:\n\nWhy not Tate?\n\nOn Halloween, when Tate was messing with Violet and wearing the suit, his body looked totally different than the bigger and more buffed up Rubber Man we see in ever other scene. Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk have a beautiful sense of detail throughout this series, and this is no mistake.\n\nAgain, there\u2019s also that gut feeling that a ghost can\u2019t get a woman pregnant.\n\nConstance?\n\nShe certainly loves that baby as if she were the baby\u2019s momma, but is she the baby daddy? This is actually a popular theory, and for the craziest show on television, we can\u2019t rule this out completely \u2013 could Constance be a shemale? A hermaphrodite?\n\nWay too much of a stretch, even for this show. She\u2019s given birth to three, let\u2019s call them \u201cspecial\u201d children and then her golden boy, Tate. Hermaphrodites are sterile, and even if she were to have gone Chaz Bono after the births, she\u2019s still shooting blanks.\n\nAlso, Jessica Lange\u2019s no \u201ca\u201d cup, and Rubber Man has no boobs.\n\nHere\u2019s the kicker, though \u2013 call it cheating, but I didn\u2019t find out this detail until after I came to the conclusion, but there\u2019s an actor named Riley Schmidt playing Rubber Man. If Rubber Man was one of the existing characters, they\u2019d just put that actor or actress in a suit for the Rubber Man scenes. There has to be a reason someone else is playing Rubber Man, you have to assume that Riley Schmidt will be showing his face next episdoe, so you can rule out ANY character that we\u2019ve already seen on the show.\n\nWhy Satan?\n\nAll that talk of hooves \u2013 the nurse faints at the sight of the ultrasound, next episode, Vivian tracks her down, the lady mentions \u201chooves\u201d and we find out she was so devistated by what she\u2019s seen, she abandoned her career in nursing to join the church as a nun. I don\u2019t think any details in this show are meaningless, but if that didn\u2019t say enough, in the next episode on an ob/gyn visit, Vivian underscored it by asking about hooves again . . .\n\n(Update: on a tip from Chris, who runs the biggest Tate Langdon group on Facebook, just watched episode 6, \u201cPiggy Piggy\u201d again, not only does the nun mention hooves, she says flat out the baby is the unclean one, the beast. I\u2019d also forgotten the scene from that episode where Leah (former Bully, basement victim) asks Violet, \u201cDo you believe in the devil?\u201d . . . \u201cNo\u201d . . . \u201cI do. I\u2019ve looked him in the eye.\u201d and she goes on to talk about Revelations, a pregnant woman, the beast and the Red Dragon.)\n\nThen there\u2019s also the way Rubber Man tossed the gay man across the room before killing both him and his partner. That was far beyond human strength. Again, this show is all about the details, and this detail cannot be ignored.\n\nIt\u2019s just three clues, but three clues too strong to ignore.\n\nOne of the most awesome things about this show is the way it pays homage to so many great horror movies of the past, it\u2019s fun for the fans of horror, it\u2019s also pretty cool to see Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk showing themselves as true fans of the genre.\n\n(Side thought \u2013 What\u2019s the difference between a rip off and a homage? A rip off is an inferior work that steals because the writers don\u2019t have any original thoughts of their own. An homage is a wink and a nod to the readers and viewers, an homage is a tribute paid to a great work from a work that is also great itself.)\n\nWe\u2019ve seen so many American Horror Story homages to great horror movies of the past \u2013 The Shining, Re-Animator, The Changeling (the original one), The Strangers . . . prepare yourself next week for the father of Rosemary\u2019s Baby to be unveiled.\n\nIf intrade had a prediction market on it, I\u2019d be sinking a nice chunk of change on it, but looks like we\u2019ll just have to wait and see if I\u2019m right. It\u2019ll be fun to see and I welcome your ridicule if I was wrong.\n\nBarack Obama is the king of corporate cash. He had two years of Democrat control of Congress to do something and things only got worse \u2013 much, much worse. He may talk a good game, paying a lot of lip service to reigning in the excesses of Wall Street, but Barack Obama is the all-time, undisputed king of corporate cash, both in raking it in and in letting the fat cats make it.\n\nThat\u2019s the reality of the HOPE that most of OWS voted for and nothing is going to CHANGE if we make the same choice in 2012.\n\nAnd while Cuba is crawling out from the rock of the stone age Communist economy it\u2019s held itself under since the 50s, oh the irony of the Occupy Movement here in the U.S. being taken over by Anarchists and Socialists so completely ignorant of history that they still believe, no matter how many times it\u2019s failed and condemned millions to misery, destitution and starvation, that something such as a Marxist worker\u2019s paradise can actually exist on this Earth.\n\nThe funny thing about these people flying their American flags upside-down and proudly holding up the red flag sporting the Commie pop icon Che Guevara \u2013 Cuba already knows it\u2019s system has failed and they\u2019re making the changes to leave the third world poverty of collectivism and join the first world prosperity which Capitalism brings, and yet even as reality is dawning on the new Castro in Cuba, at the very same time, up rise the Occupiers in America, wanting to bring that same brand of Cuban \u201ceqaulity\u201d right here, an equality where everyone is equal in misery and poverty."
