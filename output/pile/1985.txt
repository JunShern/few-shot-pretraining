    "text": "Many of the tasks these \"standing armies\" perform - including manning the police station front desk to help distressed crime victims - could be handed to civilian staff instead, he argued.\n\nHe refused to speculate how many officers could be lost, adding that more work needs to be done on what the basic minimum would be. But the figure is likely to run into thousands.\n\nRural forces are likely to lose the greatest number of officers, Sir Ronnie's 124-page review on the future of policing in England and Wales suggests.\n\nHe wants the Government to rip up a funding formula which has protected the budget given to counties with less crime - the key factor in setting budgets.\n\nThe mostly rural forces would see their budgets slashed, with the money being transferred direct to the Labour heartlands.\n\nLast night, police reacted with fury to the plan to reduce officer numbers in favour of civilian staff. Other tasks police will be expected to give up include taking witness statements.\n\nPolice Federation chairman Jan Berry said: \"You de-skill the police service and it produces a totally different police service - one that is only going to be dealing with confrontational situations, like a paramilitary force.\n\n\"That's not the police service which traditionally this country has had and we have got to be very careful before we fall into that type of police service.\"\n\nIan Johnston, president of the Police Superintendents Association, said: \"We've gone through three or four different 'civilianisation' programmes and, quite frankly, some forces are saying we can't civilianise anything else.\n\n\"If we are not very careful, we will have people specialising in delivering all different bits of policing and we might not actually have the numbers of uniformed officers we need in times of incidents or national disasters.\"\n\nThe Conservatives said the dividing line between them and the Labour government - which endorsed Sir Ronnie's report yesterday - is now clear.\n\n\"But the Conservatives will cut red tape in order to put more officers on our streets.\"\n\nSir Ronnie's report, which was leaked in draft form to the Daily Mail earlier this week, promised a bonfire of red tape, as well as new technology such as cameras attached to officers' uniforms and hand-held computers.\n\nIf levels of red tape were stripped back, it could release up to seven million hours of police time every year - the equivalent of 3,500 officers, Sir Ronnie said.\n\nIn the draft, he said six million hours were being wasted on needless bureaucracy. But the most controversial part of the report is the proposal to cut police numbers, which will alarm law-abiding members of the public who believe they rarely see an officer on the street.\n\nSir Ronnie's report said: \"There is widespread recognition amongst the leadership of the service that maintaining police numbers at their current level is not sustainable over the course of the next three years.\n\n\"I am persuaded that we would not be making the most effective use of the resources dedicated to the police if police officer numbers were sustained at their current level.\"\n\nThe former Royal Ulster Constabulary chief later added: \"I don't think that throwing numbers at the police is the answer.\"\n\nWhile Sir Ronnie refused to be drawn on numbers, past estimates have indicated the absolute minimum number of officers needed is between 130,000 and 135,000.\n\nHe said: \"The number of officers we need is a careful balance between the risks we face, and ensuring that we don't simply have officers forming large standing armies for the majority of the time, deployed only if there is a major incident of some kind.\"\n\nOther proposals include a simplification to the way 80 per cent of crimes are recorded. Serious crimes would continue to be recorded in great detail, but less serious offences would be noted down in a \"much more concise way\", said Sir Ronnie.\n\nThere were several changes to the leaked draft, the Tories said. It did not include leaked references to \"top down management\", \"declining public confidence\" or over-centralised government being \"part of the problem\".\n\nA graph was changed to present a more positive picture of the public's perceptions of crime.\n\nHome Secretary Jacqui Smith said: \"We are determined to cut unnecessary red tape and free up police officers to focus on protecting their communities and dealing with the issues that matter most to communities.\n\n\"I have formally asked Sir Ronnie to report back to me in six months on how we and the police are reducing bureaucracy.\n\n\"For our part, in addition to the measures outlined to day, the Government will be publishing a Green Paper in the spring to further improve policing for the future.\""
