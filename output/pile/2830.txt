In particular, 89% of such incidents occurred on college campuses in 2014, and 74% in 2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cForty-four years ago today, the Israeli police shot six Palestinian citizens of Israel dead as they were protesting against the Israeli government\u2019s expropriation of thousands of acres of Palestinian land in the Galilee. Since then, March 30 has been known as Land Day and is an important date in the Palestinian political calendar.\u201d\n\n\u201cI phoned my mother to ask: \u2018What were we doing during curfew times in the Intifada?\u2019 My mother laughed, and replied: \u2018We baked. A lot.\u2019 Indeed, I remember our house in Ramallah being full of the aromas of all the different cakes.\u201d\n\n\u201cPalestinians are holding their breath as they wait to see if the Palestinian Authority\u2019s desperate attempts to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) to the city of Bethlehem is working.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday unveiled his long-awaited \u2018peace deal\u2019 for the Israel-Palestine conflict, Sen. Bernie Sanders condemned the proposal as \u2018unacceptable\u2019 and called for an end to Israel\u2019s decades-long occupation of Palestinian territories.\u201d\n\n\u201cALEX ODEH WAS born in 1944 in British Mandate Palestine to a Christian family in the West Bank village of Jifna, near Ramallah, just four years before the founding of Israel. He immigrated in 1972 to the United States, where he became a spokesperson for the Arab American community, challenging negative portrayals of Middle Easterners and Muslims, which were back then at least as commonplace as they are today.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn 1919, Arthur James Balfour, the foreign secretary, wrote that in Palestine, the British government did not \u2018propose even to go through the form of consulting the wishes of the present inhabitants of the country\u2019.\u201d"
