However, if my Oracle encoding is set to AL32UTF8, I should be able to store any unicode character in a VARCHAR2, right?  Is there any way to force SSIS to map an Oracle VARCHAR2 to a DT_WSTR? Should there be?\nI looked up a few other questions on this, but nothing seems to address it.\nI have a data source that has many columns as DT_WSTR, and I want each to go into a VARCHAR2 column without having to convert every column.\n\nA:\n\nLooks like I need to be careful to specify my column length in CHAR. For example, Instead of VARCHAR2(255), I need to ensure it is VARCHAR2(255 CHAR).  If I do this, SSIS sees it as DT_WSTR.\n\n"
