But, a moderator was already aware as they commented so is flagging it just making work for others, or is this correct action?\nI have done some looking around on the Metas but can't find an answer to this I don't think?\nWhat are the review queues, and how do they work?\nHow does the new user question review process work?\n\nA:\n\nIf you don't want to flag it, you can always upvote the previous reviewer's comment and then click on \"I'm done\".\n\n"
