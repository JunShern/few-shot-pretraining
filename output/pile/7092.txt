    "text": "See also: [G Kustatscher *et\u00a0al*](https://doi.org/10.15252/msb.20177548) (August 2017)\n\nSince the earliest explorations in post\u2010genomics, one truth seems universal---genes in proximity in a genome tend to be co\u2010expressed (Hurst *et\u00a0al*, [2004](#msb177961-bib-0003){ref-type=\"ref\"}), at least when considering mRNA levels. Why is this? An appealing explanation is that functionally related genes whose protein products are needed at the same time, evolve to be close in the genome enabling coordinated regulation. A recent paper by Kustatscher *et\u00a0al* ([2017](#msb177961-bib-0004){ref-type=\"ref\"}) puts a final nail in the coffin for this hypothesis, at least as an explanation for most mRNA\u2010level co\u2010expression in humans. They show only for a few rare gene pairs is co\u2010expression at the mRNA level translated into protein\u2010level co\u2010expression. For most genes, RNA\u2010level co\u2010expression is dampened at the protein level (Fig\u00a0[1](#msb177961-fig-0001){ref-type=\"fig\"}). This, however, they suggest, does not mean that the close gene coupling and co\u2010expression is not without utility or consequence.\n\n![Genes interacting at 3D level are co\u2010expressed at the mRNA level but not at the protein level\\\nThe figure illustrates an example of patches of genes that are spatially proximal in the 3D structure of the human genome (Hi\u2010C data), are co\u2010regulated at the mRNA level but are not co\u2010regulated at the protein level (Kustatscher *et\u00a0al*, [2017](#msb177961-bib-0004){ref-type=\"ref\"}).](MSB-13-943-g001){#msb177961-fig-0001}\n\nGenes in a bidirectional orientation and in very close proximity (\\<\u00a01\u00a0kb) account for an unexpectedly high proportion (\\~10%) of gene pairs in our genome (Trinklein *et\u00a0al*, [2004](#msb177961-bib-0009){ref-type=\"ref\"}). Such genes tend to be co\u2010expressed at the RNA level and seen together as a pair in the mouse genome (Trinklein *et\u00a0al*, [2004](#msb177961-bib-0009){ref-type=\"ref\"}). It could be supposed that the co\u2010expression of the two genes in such a pair enables protein\u2010level coordination. To test this idea, Kustatscher *et\u00a0al* ([2017](#msb177961-bib-0004){ref-type=\"ref\"}) examined housekeeping genes expressed in human lymphoblastoid cell lines and, unusually, examined both RNA\u2010 and protein\u2010level co\u2010expression. Looking at 167 such very close bidirectional gene pairs, they found 31 showing strong co\u2010expression at the RNA level. Of these, only three gene pairs showed sustained co\u2010expression at the protein level. Generally, those buffered at the protein level do not share common functions, while those retaining co\u2010expression do (Kustatscher *et\u00a0al*, [2017](#msb177961-bib-0004){ref-type=\"ref\"}). The same RNA\u2010level co\u2010expression and protein\u2010level attenuation are seen for genes in close proximity not in bidirectional orientation. These results suggest that the protein\u2010level functional co\u2010operation model for gene order evolution explains some, but not very much, of the observed genome organization, concurring what prior evidence in yeast.\n\nThen why are so many genes so tightly coupled in bidirectional orientation (Trinklein *et\u00a0al*, [2004](#msb177961-bib-0009){ref-type=\"ref\"}) and why are so many neighbouring genes co\u2010expressed to some degree? An attractive null model to explain neighbour co\u2010expression proposes that open chromatin affects blocks of genes and enables their expression (Raj *et\u00a0al*, [2006](#msb177961-bib-0007){ref-type=\"ref\"}). Kustatscher *et\u00a0al* ([2017](#msb177961-bib-0004){ref-type=\"ref\"}) add to this null model showing that genes that are co\u2010expressed at the mRNA level tend to reside in the same or interacting genome \"compartments\", identified in Hi\u2010C data as showing long\u2010range interactions. Importantly, this is true for neighbour genes and genes not in the immediate 1D vicinity but that nonetheless are interacting in 3D space. While this co\u2010expression does not translate to the protein level, the authors sensibly suggest that there is no reason to suspect any active buffering. Post\u2010transcriptional effects such as different miRNA regulation, different ribosome occupancy and different protein half\u2010lives are probably enough to explain why an initial signal of mRNA\u2010level co\u2010expression disappears at the protein level. Quantitative modelling of the expected collapse of co\u2010expression, from RNA into protein level, for random gene pairs would help clarify whether the attenuation is any more than would be expected. One enigma is why genes that interact in 3D are functionally more similar than expected by chance (Thevenin *et\u00a0al*, [2014](#msb177961-bib-0008){ref-type=\"ref\"}) but apparently not co\u2010expressed at the protein level.\n\nWhile this RNA co\u2010expression of co\u2010compartment genes does not translate to the protein level (Fig\u00a0[1](#msb177961-fig-0001){ref-type=\"fig\"}), Kustatscher *et\u00a0al* ([2017](#msb177961-bib-0004){ref-type=\"ref\"}) also report that genes whose protein products are co\u2010expressed do not correlate with spatial organization of the DNA. For these functionally related proteins, the authors suggest that post\u2010transcriptional adaptations may well be required to preserve co\u2010expression (e.g. selection for similar protein half\u2010life). It is indeed striking that unlinked genes whose proteins are part of the same protein complex have stronger correlations at the protein level than at the RNA level (Kustatscher *et\u00a0al*, [2017](#msb177961-bib-0004){ref-type=\"ref\"}).\n\nSo perhaps co\u2010expression is mostly just a product of chromatin dynamics and, with very few exceptions, there is nothing to write home about. Kustatscher *et\u00a0al* ([2017](#msb177961-bib-0004){ref-type=\"ref\"}), however, argue that there is most likely more to it than this. Indeed, if gene expression parameters are modulated at a chromatin level or by local interactions, gene order might well evolve in response to such effects, assuming selection to be strong enough. In this context, a key further property of genomes is the observed clustering of housekeeping/essential genes (Lercher *et\u00a0al*, [2002](#msb177961-bib-0005){ref-type=\"ref\"}; Pal & Hurst, [2003](#msb177961-bib-0006){ref-type=\"ref\"}). Co\u2010expression of essential genes is not so important but since essential genes are, by definition, dose\u2010sensitive, it is important to ensure that their dose never sinks to low levels by chance. Indeed, as expected, essential genes have low noise in expression and so rarely risk the calamitous fate of accidentally being depleted (Batada & Hurst, [2007](#msb177961-bib-0001){ref-type=\"ref\"}).\n\nIn this context, it was suggested that genomic organization on both a cluster (Batada & Hurst, [2007](#msb177961-bib-0001){ref-type=\"ref\"}) and gene\u2010pair (Wang *et\u00a0al*, [2011](#msb177961-bib-0010){ref-type=\"ref\"}) level might be part of the solution to the problem of noise control for dose\u2010sensitive genes. Keep chromatin permanently open and transcription is always possible. Allow genes to maintain each others' open chromatin status and expression level fluctuations can be smoothed. The effect can be most profound for genes in bidirectional orientation and genomically very close: one gene primes the neighbour (and vice versa) and in so doing stabilizes expression levels (low noise) (Wang *et\u00a0al*, [2011](#msb177961-bib-0010){ref-type=\"ref\"}). Toy models of this mutual interdependence predict that RNA co\u2010expression is an epiphenomenon of gene pair dynamics of low noise genes (Wang *et\u00a0al*, [2011](#msb177961-bib-0010){ref-type=\"ref\"}).\n\nPreliminary data supported this showing that essential gene clusters are indeed low noise clusters (Batada & Hurst, [2007](#msb177961-bib-0001){ref-type=\"ref\"}), that transgenes inserted into such low noise clusters adopt a low noise level (Chen & Zhang, [2016](#msb177961-bib-0002){ref-type=\"ref\"}), that genes in bidirectional orientation have especially low noise (Wang *et\u00a0al*, [2011](#msb177961-bib-0010){ref-type=\"ref\"}) and that essential genes are especially likely to be found in bidirectional orientation (Wang *et\u00a0al*, [2011](#msb177961-bib-0010){ref-type=\"ref\"}). Kustatscher *et\u00a0al* ([2017](#msb177961-bib-0004){ref-type=\"ref\"}) importantly show that, indeed, for highly gene dense regions gene clustering is associated with reduced noise at both RNA and protein levels, as this model predicts. Gene density is here potentially important as gene--gene non\u2010independence is to a first approximation dependent on between\u2010gene distance profile (Wang *et\u00a0al*, [2011](#msb177961-bib-0010){ref-type=\"ref\"}).\n\nThus, there seem to be three viable models to account for pervasive co\u2010expression of neighbouring genes at the mRNA level. First, for a very limited number of neighbouring gene pairs co\u2010expression *per se* is an important part of their biology, these pairs being especially highly co\u2010expressed, functionally related and, at least in yeasts, preserved as a pair over evolutionary time. Second, many other signals of co\u2010expression are better considered a happenstance of chromatin dynamics. But, third, some co\u2010expression appears to viably be explained as an epiphenomenon of selection for low noise of dose\u2010sensitive genes, by adoption of the dynamics of DNA that enable co\u2010expression. What is unclear is how common this adoption is and whether, for example, it can explain why gene density varies around a genome. Are housekeeping clusters high\u2010density clusters to enable this sort of noise control by enabling non\u2010independence in expression? Or might we instead be looking at a mutation bias? For reasons still unclear, essential gene clusters in yeast have unusually low recombination rates (Pal & Hurst, [2003](#msb177961-bib-0006){ref-type=\"ref\"}). Could a relationship between recombination and sequence gain/loss dynamics explain such a trend?\n"
