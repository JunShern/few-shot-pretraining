    "text": "Q:\n\nMaking bootstrap navbar sticky only when navbar-collapse show\n\nI want to make my navbar into a fixed position only if the collapsed menu is shown. It seems I can only make it permanently fixed regardless of the collapse function trigger, which is not what I want. \nThis is what I have\n<nav class=\"navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-light bg-white align-items-stretch\">\n  <a href=\"{{ url('/') }}\" class=\"navbar-brand\">\n    <img class=\"navbar-logo img-fluid\" src=\"{{ asset('img/generic.png') }}\">\n  </a>\n  <button class=\"navbar-toggler collapsed\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-target=\"#navbar_collapse\" aria-expanded=\"false\">\n    <span class=\"navbar-toggler-icon \"></span>\n  </button>\n  <div class=\"navbar-collapse collapse align-items-stretch bg-white\" id=\"navbar_collapse\">\n  <!--collapse menu code-->\n  </div>\n</nav>\n\nand in my css file to specify the navbar only on device version\n    @media (max-width: 992px) {\n        .navbar-fix  {\n            position: fixed;\n            top: 0;\n            right: 0;\n            left: 0;\n            z-index: 10;\n        }\n    }\n\nand my script\n\n$( document ).ready(function() {\n    $('.navbar').click(function(){\n        $('.navbar.navbar-fixed').removeClass('navbar-fixed');\n        $(this).addClass('navbar-fixed');\n        console.log( \"nav fix\" );\n    });\n});\n\nWhich doesn't load it back to relative position when the collapse is hidden. And how can I specify so it's only fixed when I click on the toggler?\n\nA:\n\nIt's a little difficult to discern exactly what you are asking, but I'll give it a shot.\nSo, when you say... \n\nI want to make my navbar into a fixed position only if the collapsed menu is shown. It seems I can only make it permanently fixed regardless of the collapse function trigger.\n\nIt seems as though you are having difficulty changing the navbar position attribute at the lg(992px) breakpoint. Without more content on the page, it's difficult to determine what's actually happening upon hitting the breakpoint. So, I inserted your snippet into my IDE, added some filler text and played around with Chrome's dev tools to see what was happening.\nLet's breakdown the components at work here... \nFor navbar, the class \"navbar-expand-lg\" is saying to expand/show the navbar when the screen is 992px or more. So the collapsed version will display only when the size is less that 992px. \nNow, your css snippet has a media query for the lg breakpoint(992px). Therefore, the styles inside @media codeblock will apply when the screen is 992px or less. Since the position attribute is being set to \"fixed\" inside this @media query, the navbar is being set to fixed when the screen is 992px or less.\nPutting it all together, you \n\nwant to make my navbar into a fixed position only if the collapsed menu is shown.\n\nYour collapsed menu is shown when screen size is less than 992px. Your @media query is setting the navbar to fixed when the screen size is less than 992px. What may fix your issue is setting the navbar position attribute specifically for when the screen is bigger than 992px. \nIf I didn't answer the right question, or if you were trying to remove the navbar completely except when collapsed is showing, look into the display setting to remove it at the lg breakpoint. \nHope this helps!\n\n"
