    "text": "Power consumption of mobile battery operated devices such as mobile communication terminals is expected to increase as the demand for enhanced functionality increases.\nFor example, there is a demand for communication terminals that are capable of communicating in a plurality of different communication systems, including second generation systems such as GSM/GPRS and third generation systems such as WCDMA/EGPRS/HSDPA as well as WLAN systems of the 802.11 family. Moreover, increased power consumption is due also to other hardware parts of a typical communication terminal, especially the applications processor and the main display. In addition, advanced features exploiting the hardware functionality contribute to this increase, e.g. 3D games, video players, etc.\nSuch terminals will consume much more energy in comparison with earlier terminals, these earlier terminals having only limited functionality and, e.g., being capable of communicating in only a single communication system.\nWith the current progress in battery capacity unable to keep pace with the increasing demands posed by such feature-rich mobile devices, new ways to control and sensibly reduce the power consumption of terminals are needed. Hardware solutions typically involve implementation of circuitry having inherently low power consumption. Such hardware solutions may involve the use of specific materials as well as reducing the number of components to a minimum. Needless to say, hardware solutions are not very flexible and they provide a very limited amount of functionality.\nSoftware solutions, on the other hand, typically offer an advantage over purely hardware-based solutions in that software can keep track of the context of the monitored device and thus make it possible for a software developer to make more sensible decisions as to when and where to optimize power. However, it is only through complex setup of expensive external digital measuring equipment and configuration of dedicated and specialized software that this is feasible in the prior art. That is, visibility of the energy and power consumption of an application in the prior art is possible only through the use of external equipment. A developer need to perform more or less complex configuration procedures to set up the equipment in order to find out where to optimize the operation of a device.\nA drawback related to prior art methods and devices is hence that an application developer, when developing a software application for execution in a mobile communication device, has a very limited capability of optimizing the software application in terms of its effect on the power consumption by the device. In fact, an application developer typically has no way of finding out how battery lifetime is effected by a software application being developed."
