    "text": "Rick Paulas | Longreads | August 2016 | 12 minutes (2,986 words)\n\nThe storytelling show Mortified was created in 2002 by Dave Nadelberg, and the show has a clever angle: Performers share \u201ctheir most mortifying childhood artifacts,\u201d along with a running behind-the-scenes commentary from their younger selves. It\u2019s show-and-tell meets #tbt, and the results are hilarious. The show\u2019s so beloved by performers and audiences that there are now nearly a dozen Mortified shows performed each month throughout various \u201cchapters\u201d around the world: eight in the U.S., eight abroad. Tickets range between $10 and $20-plus.\n\nThey also don\u2019t pay performers, at least not in money. Mortified, like The Moth, Upright Citizens Brigade, and even TED Talks, is one of the hundreds of live events around the world that have sprouted up during an era in which experiential entertainment, or the IRL economy, were supposed to grow more cherished (and more lucrative) as entertainment products became digitized and commoditized. There\u2019s just one problem: Live events exist in the same way many independent publishers exist\u2014on a shoestring budget in which the performer is usually the last to be paid.\n\nAt Mortified, \u201ceveryone who participates is compensated on some level, and that depends on the circumstance,\u201d said Nadelberg. \u201cWe\u2019re making sure we\u2019re giving participants things that are enough value, usually at least $30, maybe $60 or $70. It\u2019s hard to value that. There are so many different factors.\u201d\n\nThe show will give performers comped tickets, drink tickets for the bar, free entry for life, gift bags, food in the green room. (If an ancillary project has money built into the budget\u2014like their movie, TV show, book, or if they\u2019re doing a corporate-sponsored show\u2014they\u2019ll pay performers from that chunk.) They\u2019ll occasionally pay for a hotel if someone\u2019s coming in from out of town, at the very least give them a couch to crash on. They also spend time directly working with storytellers, a not insignificant expense. \u201cOne of the main things [performers] are getting is a producer who\u2019s sitting down and workshopping their piece with them,\u201d said Nadelberg. \u201cSometimes ten hours with each participant, maybe even longer.\u201d\n\nBut, here\u2019s the rub. The show is at a point in terms of scope and popularity where some performers aren\u2019t happy about their lack of compensation. While Nadelberg said he \u201cchecks in\u201d regularly with performers about compensation, as I was investigating this piece, more than one performer countered with some queasy feelings about leaving shows with bare pockets. (These same performers wished to remain anonymous, for fear of pissing off the gatekeepers and not being invited back.)\n\nDrink tickets? Great, but they don\u2019t drink. Swag? Who needs more crap in the closet. Most of the venues where most of the Mortified plays have a bar, so they should be dealing with larger pools of cash. And while producers do refine the story with a performer before they get onstage, shows often reuse the same performers over and over without further workshopping; so, whatever \u201cvalue\u201d from that initial editing session quickly diminishes with each performance. It doesn\u2019t help that performers tend to be in multiple shows over the same weekend. \u201cThey get 300 people every weekend, at $15 a pop, we perform two shows, and they can\u2019t give us any of it?\u201d asked one performer. \u201cI get it, they\u2019re not making tons of money. But at the end of the day, people are paying at the door. Should the producer get all of the money?\u201d asked another.\n\nDoes the producer even make any money? Laurenne Sala is one of the creators of Taboo Tales, which hosts a Los Angeles-based storytelling show four times a year that specializes in particularly harrowing stories (the show has also expanded to New York City). \u201cThe more we talk about how fucked up we are,\u201d reads the show\u2019s motto, \u201cthe more normal we all feel.\u201d Each show is different, but on average, they have seven storytellers and a host. Tickets cost $15 and shows sell out a venue of about 100 seats. They don\u2019t pay.\n\n\u201cWe would love to pay our performers,\u201d said Sala. \u201cThey work hard. It actually pains me not to give them money.\u201d\n\nSala, who\u2019s a friend of mine, walks me through the money. Let\u2019s say the venue has 100 seats, after comps for industry and friends of performers, the paying customer total goes down to 80 or so. Money coming in from an average show is close to $1,000. And where does that money go? The venue is the biggest chunk, which costs $500 to rent. Taboo Tales also utilizes the service of a videographer, a photographer, and a tech person, each costing around $100 a piece. Their programs cost $50, another $50 goes to prizes they give to audience members.\n\nCarry the one, and you\u2019re left with roughly zero in \u201cprofit.\u201d\n\nSometimes they make a little dough, though. They\u2019ll get extra donations, walk away with an extra few hundred. And where does that go? There\u2019s the website, the podcast, advertising, graphic design cost, the use of software for collaborating on story notes. And, oh yeah, the legwork that goes into contacting performers, wrangling venue logistics, editing/workshopping stories, spreading the word through social media. \u201cWe start working on it a month and a half before the show, and don\u2019t get paid anything,\u201d said Sala. \u201cNot a drop.\u201d Whatever money\u2019s left after goes back into the kitty for future endeavors.\n\n(One big hindrance for Taboo Tales is that their venue doesn\u2019t have a bar on the premises. Venues that sell alcohol can\u2014at least, should\u2014make enough from those sales to cover their own expenses without forcing a hefty rental fee. Good venues\u2014that is, those interested in helping cultivate a \u201cscene\u201d or \u201cnight\u201d\u2014will also provide the show with what they deem a fair split of door ticket sales; 70 percent is great. Not only does that give producers the ability to pay performers, but it feels more like a partnership. \u201cIf a venue will go in on [ticket sales] with me, we both have the incentive to advertise,\u201d said one artist.)\n\nTaboo Tales, then, is a show that doesn\u2019t pay because it doesn\u2019t have the money, as indie as it comes. It\u2019s how most storytelling shows, or comedy festivals, or stand-up nights, or indie publishers begin: a few friends trying to do something fun for the sake of doing it. But every now and then, a show gets lucky and becomes a great enough success to justify expansion. And then, it\u2019s time to deal with the slippery awkwardness of introducing compensation into the equation.\n\nLive events exist in the same way many independent publishers exist\u2014on a shoestring budget in which the performer is usually the last to be paid.\n\n***\n\nThe Moth, the national nonprofit storytelling organization, is the behemoth of the enterprise. They have monthly shows throughout every major American city, a regular-scheduled \u201ctraveling\u201d Mainstage show, a weekly radio show on PRX, and a weekly podcast that is downloaded 30 million times a year. When it comes to pay for the live shows, they have a unique formula: They don\u2019t pay for participation in their regular StorySLAM shows. In fact, because of how they choose their lineup\u201420 names drawn from a hat before the show\u2014performers actually have to pay $10 to get in. After ten StorySLAMs are held, the ten \u2018winners\u2019 then graduate to GrandSLAM shows . On the surface, this seems sketchy. One alternative would be for just the winners to pay if they\u2019re chosen, but that\u2019s a lot less money, and it doesn\u2019t feel right either.\n\n\u201cPeople in the community have told us they don\u2019t think [pay at StorySLAM events] is a good idea, that there\u2019s a spirit of fun that would be taken away,\u201d said Catherine Burns, artistic director of The Moth. \u201cInstead, what we try to do if someone\u2019s coming to the SLAMs a lot is try to get them on the Mainstage.\u201d\n\nWhen they book a Mainstage performance\u2014a best-of curated event with \u201cbooked\u201d storytellers, often with hours of editing and workshopping, tickets costing between $25 to $50 depending on the venue\u2014performers will get $200 if they\u2019re local, $500 if they have to travel. \u201cWe don\u2019t pay much, but we pay promptly,\u201d said Burns. \u201cThat was always the case, even when we didn\u2019t have a pot to piss in.\u201d They also work with someone at the show to help edit and refine their story, the process taking anywhere between \u201cfive, 10, 17 hours\u201d to get everything just right.\n\nThere\u2019s extra value in that. Performers have been \u201cdiscovered\u201d through The Moth, some receiving book deals, others getting invites to be on television. At the very least, it\u2019s a calling card that will get a performer booked onto any other storytelling show in their town. There is, certainly, a chance that a performer taking The Moth stage will be seen by the right person at the right time, and quickly find their way into the slipstream of performance economy. It\u2019s not the sole reason to perform shows for free, but it\u2019s one of them.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a little triangle we like to use,\u201d said Adam Kurtz, a pedal steel musician in Nashville who spent years in L.A. \u201cMoney, the hang, the music. You need two of those to take the gig. If there\u2019s no money, but the music\u2019s really cool, and the hang is really good, you do it. If the money\u2019s really good, and the music\u2019s really good, but the dudes suck, well\u2026\u201d\n\nMarian Call is a folk singer/songwriter based in Juneau, Alaska. When I ask her for her personal mental calculus, she makes a point to highlight that the only rule is there are no clear rules. \u201cIt\u2019s tempting to put down hard and fast rules of when to and when not to,\u201d said Call. \u201cBut it really limits you and makes it difficult.\u201d When playing for cheap/free, Call promotes transparency about finances throughout her set. \u201cTraining my audience to voluntarily pitch in when there\u2019s no ticket price has made it sustainable for me,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you can pay, the jar\u2019s over there. If you can\u2019t pay, tell people you love the show. Every dollar you can\u2019t pay, do a Facebook post.\u201d\n\nThis tactic isn\u2019t always viable for certain live performers; the third act in a four-person comedy show can\u2019t take a few minutes to pass around a personal donation hat if they ever want to be invited back. More importantly, certain venues or scenes need free or cheap labor to exist. Without it, they\u2019d disappear entirely. In those cases, Call advocates playing for free, but still being extremely mindful when doing so.\n\nUnfortunately, less noble enterprises are allowed to exploit these murky rules and those aforementioned success stories of \u201cbeing discovered\u201d by selling performers on the false concept of \u201cexposure.\u201d\n\n\u2018There\u2019s a little triangle we like to use,\u2019 said Adam Kurtz, a pedal steel musician in Nashville who spent years in L.A. \u2018Money, the hang, the music. You need two of those to take the gig.\u2019\n\n***\n\nThe world of showbiz is full of detestable human beings, but the most parasitic among them run something called a \u201cbringer\u201d show. In the music world, it\u2019s often called \u201cpay to play.\u201d They allow performers on their stage, as long as they bring (x) audience members with them. Sometimes this tactic manifests itself by having patrons give the performer\u2019s name at the box office, where the official tally sheet lives. Other times, they sell performers advance tickets, turning them into a middleman hawker of sorts; whatever they don\u2019t sell is on them. Once (x) is met, the performer gets a small percentage of sales, but, usually, that never happens. Kegs will be changed, bottles will clink into the recycle bin, and the \u201cbringer\u201d show runners will take home all that sweet, sweet money.\n\nNow and then, a performer may ask why they\u2019d ever agree to this deal. The response might return to this promise of \u201cexposure\u201d by appearing onstage. Maybe they don\u2019t say that dirty word anymore, and maybe it\u2019s that \u201cthe industry is going to be there.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you hear \u2018pay-to-play,\u2019 you are being scammed by the venue,\u201d said Kurtz. \u201cYou\u2019re not getting what you think you\u2019re getting. They are trying to take money from you, you will not get exposure.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth pointing out the inherent contradiction in \u201cbringer\u201d or \u201cpay-to-play\u201d shows: The performers are bringing their own audience. (Sure, they can tell their grandkids they played The Viper Room on a famed Sunset Strip stage, but maybe leave out the playing-in-front-of-20-friends part.) More to the point: Someone is trying to get a performer to accept lower than they\u2019re worth by claiming to know how \u201cexposure\u201d works.\n\nThey don\u2019t. No one does.\n\nIt\u2019s not that \u201cexposure\u201d doesn\u2019t exist. It does, sort of, but it\u2019s more along the lines of \u201cnetworking.\u201d Performers get exposed to other performers, friendships form out of common likes and dislikes. Later, when these people are in positions of power, they\u2019ll call the numbers they have, the same relationships that drive any industry. When those people are in the positions to make decisions, they\u2019ll do the same thing, the web will expand, the cycle will continue. So, the only true exposure worth touting is one that cultivates relationships with other performers.\n\nThe Upright Citizens Brigade\u2014two theaters in N.Y., another two in L.A.\u2014is a venue that trades on this exposure/networking currency. Despite constant sellouts\u2014tickets are free, $5, or $10\u2014they also do not pay performers. While there was a noted kerfuffle about this back in 2013, most performers don\u2019t feel taken advantage of. Rather, they feel the combination of (a) lessons learned onstage; (b) the ability to perform with top-quality improvisers; (c) performing in front of adoring, forgiving, hip, and \u201cindustry\u201d-filled audiences far surpasses whatever small chunk of their show\u2019s near-menial earnings they\u2019d get.\n\n(Another aspect helping the value of \u201cUCB exposure\u201d is that it operates in two cities where this mythical \u201cexposure\u201d might actually exist. Playing in front of an audience in New York or Los Angeles is a whole lot different than performing in Salt Lake City, Seattle, even San Francisco. \u201cYou\u2019re more likely to have a literary agent in New York, or some sort of film agent in L.A,\u201d said Burns. \u201cIt\u2019s just inevitable that that\u2019s true.\u201d)\n\nBut while the UCB may be \u201cdoing it right,\u201d their success created copycats. \u201cWhen the [comedy] boom started again, the scene in L.A. was mostly non-pay venues,\u201d said Sam Varela, producer and founder of Naked Comedy, an independent comedy production company. \u201cMaybe [producers] went to the UCB, or one of the many other venues that charged for tickets and didn\u2019t pay performers, saw how it works, and was like, I can do this. It gives everybody else an out saying, well, we\u2019re also not going to pay you. It\u2019s just a bad precedent to set.\u201d This is a problem. While the UCB has become a bonafide factory\u2014you can\u2019t turn on a new comedy show without seeing someone that worked at one of their theaters\u2014they\u2019re the exception. \u201cMy experience with exposure is just being at the right place at the right time and knowing the right people,\u201d said Varela. \u201cThere\u2019s not a specific way to \u2018win,\u2019 or complete the level. It\u2019s a marathon thing.\u201d\n\nThe idea that some magical tastemaker is in the audience waiting to \u201cdiscover\u201d any performer is a myth, proliferated by those profiting from exploiting free labor. (This also occurs when it comes to writing for certain publications, say The Huffington Post, which try to get some folks to write for zero dollars and \u201cthe unique platform and reach our site provides\u201d. That\u2019s code for \u201cexposure,\u201d a shameful act by a company rumored to be valued at nearly $1 billion.) There will be those willing to exploit free labor as long as there\u2019s labor that is exploitable. And live performance has an ever-refreshing pool of talent from which to draw from.\n\n\u201cThe sad reality is that there are so many performers, they don\u2019t have to pay us,\u201d said Dave Ross, an L.A.-based comedian who produces the weekly show Good Heroin; they pay performers by splitting up a donation bucket after the show. \u201cIt\u2019s a supply and demand issue. A performer says \u2018no\u2019 to a show, and they say, \u2018okay, wish we would\u2019ve had you, but this guy will do it for free.\u2019\u201d As long as there are success stories, and those trying to be the next, there will be claims that the code can be cracked.\n\nRoss tells a story about the time he agreed to do a television show for a small amount of money because he knew that it\u2019d reach a large audience. It was a decision he was comfortable with, until the producer told him how much \u201cexposure\u201d he\u2019d be getting. \u201cI was like, I know that, that\u2019s why I\u2019m doing it for this little money,\u201d said Ross. \u201cBut don\u2019t say it. And don\u2019t think it. Let me make up my mind about what it\u2019s worth for me.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s the disconnect. Even if exposure does exist\u2014again, it sort of does\u2014it\u2019s not something that can be calculated.\n\n\u201cExposure is bullshit,\u201d said Ross. \u201cIt\u2019s unfair, abusive, and takes advantage of the fact that it\u2019s really, really hard to make it.\u201d\n\nSo, what\u2019s the solution? The venue, show, festival isn\u2019t going to change until their hands are forced. Things have been working fine for them, so why would they? And while a boycott/strike by performers may have worked in the past\u2014and could potentially work in a tight-knit community in a small town\u2014any big city has too great of a refresh rate for one to be truly effective. Potential scabs are on every bus into town, supply completely crushes demand in this industry.\n\nThe only real solution, maybe, is for change to come from the remaining party in the live performance transaction: Those paying at the door.\n\n***\n\nRick Paulas has written plenty of things, some of them serious, many of them not.
