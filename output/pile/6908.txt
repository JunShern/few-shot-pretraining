    "text": "Holidays in Paris, France\n\nBook Flight+Hotel\n\nParis has an incomparable mesmerising quality. The City of Love is probably one of the world\u2019s most visited cities and is known to bring out the romance in the most cynical. Going by foot is the best way to explore the city\u2019s districts, streets, sidewalks and great parks.\n\nParis has all but exhausted the superlatives that can reasonably be applied to any city. Notre Dame and the Eiffel Tower - at sunrise, at sunset, at night - have been described countless times, as have the Seine and the subtle (and not-so-subtle) differences between the Left and Right Banks. It is busy with thousands of tourists, but the city has managed to keep its real authenticity. Whether you are there for business, fashion or love, you will definitely be swept away.\n\nRadisson Blu Disneyland\u00ae Paris \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nLess than 10 minutes from the theme parks and on the grounds of Golf Disneyland\u00ae, the Radisson Blu Hotel at Disneyland\u00ae Paris combines an ideal location with welcoming features to make any Disney vacation even more memorable. The hotel provides free round-trip shuttle service to the theme parks, located only 7 minutes away, and features 250 contemporary rooms and suites with Free high-speed, wireless Internet. Relax after a day at the parks with 2 on-site restaurants, a spa and fitness center, and 27 meeting rooms with state-of-the-art technology.\n\nHotel Califormia is just steps away from the famous Champs Elysees, in the heart of a fashionable area offering a wealth of elegant boutiques, cinemas and theatres. The hotel's classic Art Deco architecture is filled with light and opens on a bucolic central patio offering tranquility and relaxation. It is an ideal place to stay whether you are visiting Paris on vacation or for business.\n\nThe only five star hotel on the Champs Elysees with exceptional accommodations and intuitive service, ideal for blending work and play. The hotel features stylish event space and is just minutes from some of the city's most elegant boutiques and popular attractions including Christian Dior, Louis Vuitton and Valentino; Arc de Triomphe, Louvre Museum and the Eiffel Tower."
