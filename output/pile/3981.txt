Well anyway, after a long time away, with a lot of healing, and soul searching DH and I have decided it is time to start our FET. I just got home from my new RE (DH and I moved from NH to NY in September!) and after a hysteroscopy showed that my uterus is as the nurses called it \"perfect\". The nurse then asked me if I ever had a hysterosalpingogram (HSG) test done. I told her that I had when I had my lap done when I was diagnosed with stage 4 endo, and they told me that my right tube was completely closed, and that my left one was 90% closed. She then told me that on the ultrasound it looked like my left tube was a little inflamed and she wanted me to have a HSG done while I was there. She said that if it was bad that I would need to have my tubes removed before I could start my FET. So there I sat...waiting...thinking why did I get myself into this mess again...There is noway I could have surgery....I can't take that much time off of work...blah blah blah...so the RE came in and did the HSG and he told me that everything looked just fine. I said what?? He showed me on the screen how the dye went into both tubes perfectly, and that both of them were wide open with no problems!!! I was in SHOCK!! He told me there was no need for surgery, and that I have the go ahead to start my FET with next months cycle day 1!!!\n\nI am so excited, but also a little confused because I never had an FET before. I would love to have advice and support from you amazing wonderful woman. Please join me, and we can get through this together!!\n\nHere we go again!!!\n\nMuch love always,Franny\n\nLast edited by turtle0619 on Wed May 02, 2012 1:26 pm, edited 1 time in total.\n\nFranny -- Remember you? Are you kidding... I think of you all the time! I'm so happy you got such good news and are moving on to this FET. I think you've got fantastic odds with that perfect uterus of yours. I am excited for you and look forward to stalking the heck out of you! Much love to you my friend.\n\nP.S. Remember Katie99? She's also doing a donor embie cycle as we speak! You should PM her.\n\nHi Franny!!! I'm with Lou - do we remember you?? Well thats a silly question girl, I've wondered what you were up to for awhile now! I'm thrilled to hear that have a great new RE and open tubes but mostly that you're feeling up to taking on another cycle, ahem, a successful cycle! Lou is right I'm waiting for AF as we speak ( well type, lol) I have to say that you've been missed greatly and I'm pushing for this to be it for you honey! Much love Franny & Lou - xoxo\n\nAHHH Franny!! How I have missed you!! I stalk these boards frequently as to catch up on some old names/friends and I was so delighted to see you start a new thread!!! First I am SOOO happy to hear that you feel emotionally/mentally/and physically ready to start up again and I know that you and your DH are in such a great place!!! Great mental attitude all the way!!!\n\nSo-regarding FET's....I LOVED doing it so much better than a fresh cycle because it is less morning monitoring, NO bloating from the stims, and less stress on the body. They can also manipulate the first part of your cycle to get your lining thick enough and estrogen high enough before starting the PIO shots.\n\nI know I never responded to your last FB email but I wanted to let you know that I got pregnant naturally on our Aruba vacation after my chemical pregnancy. It almost doesn't sound real when I say it out loud but we saw the hb on Saturday and go back Wednesday to hopefully hear the hb!! I'm in shock since we were literally getting the paperwork together to start our FET in January and we were blessed with this miracle!\n\nI can't wait to be your BIGGEST cheerleader and your old fans are going to come out of the woodworks for you hun!\n\nFranny - welcome back! Come join us on the main thread -- lots of new people (thank goodness, most of the 'regular's are moved forward...) but I'm still here as well as some other \"oldies but goodies\" and the new people are nice too.\n\nFranny - Welcome back!!! I'm so excited to see your screen name pop up on a thread!! I always think of you when I go to visit my family in upstate NY since we talked about how much we loved Saratoga before (and you actually knew what the Teepee was near my parents' town and NO ONE ever knows that LOL.) Anyways, I'm wishing you and DH lots of good luck on this FET cycle and I'll be cheering you on!\n\nFranny - Welcome back!!! I'm so excited to see your screen name pop up on a thread!!

Anyways, I'm wishing you and DH lots of good luck on this FET cycle and I'll be cheering you on!\n\nOk i'm seriously already in tears! Happy tears. I'm so sorry I've been away from here for so long. I hope you all understand. It was just so hard to be left behind. I needed space, and I needed to get a clear head and put IVF on hold for a little bit. I am so sorry for not being as supportive as I should have been for all of my dear friends who's dreams have come true!\n\nlou Oh I missed you too!! I think about you all the time too. I'm so happy for you. It must be unreal to have your lil girl in your arms. How is mommyhood? Are you back to work? Thank you for always being here for me. I'm sorry I went MIA. xoxo\n\nkatie I didn't know you were doing another FET!!!! OMG sweetie I am sending you sooooo much good sticky vibes! Are they from the same batch at the last 2 cycles?? did you poas? When is your beta? how many did you transfer?? Give me the details girl!! Oh I drove by your exit on the thruway when I went down to NYC for NYE and I almost called you, but it was pretty late. I would love to meet Ryan some day. Now that we live in the same state we need to plan a much needed visit.\n\nclaud OMG OMG!!! I totally can't believe it!! wow!! I am thrilled for you. That is amazing. you know I adore you, and you don't know how much it has meant to me that you have always checked up on my on fb. It really does mean a lot to me. You are an amazing woman, and I am so lucky to have you as a friend. Looks like your going to have to go another summer with no shows!! If I go to any down in NJ we need to meet up for lunch though!!\n\nleoria Oh hun I am heart broken that you are still stuck in level one of this horrible game with me. You have always given me so much strength to continue on in this journey. This has got to happen for us!! It has too. I don't know if i'm ready to join in on such a large cycle group, but I'll poke in and always cheer you on!!\n\nAmanda we were posting at the same time!! Your daughter is beautiful! I'm so happy for you. Barry and I moved back to new york in September. There were just way too many sad memories in NH, and we both were offered really good jobs here that we just took it as a sign and moved. We went to Howe caverns in the fall, and then took a drive down to cobleskill and oneonta, and I know it's not exactly by your home town I did think of you while we were driving around that day. I hope everything is going well.\n\nI can't believe everyone is already trying for #2 or is already pregnant with #2!!\n\nThank you all so much for thinking of me. It means so much. I wasn't sure if I was going to come back and post again because of all of the sad memories, but if it wasn't for the support from all of you gals it would've been a million times harder.\n\nI'm so excited to defrost these lil embies, and see what happens. xoxoxo\n\nWe all understand the need to take a break from the forums for a bit. I've had to do it a few times also. IVF isnt for the faint of heart, luckily us multiple cycle girls all poke in and read when we can and as soon as you see a familar name, boy you're just sucked right back in again. I'm thrilled to see you getting back on the roller coaster - because dammit, this time is it! I'll be right along with you - well that is if AF ever shows up, grrr why when you're waiting for it does it always decide to be late? FETs are sooo much easier, less appts, 2 u/s, and need I even mention that the crazy amount of stim meds we used to need isnt even a thought with a FET. Yiippee for that alone, right? No these are from a different batch, different clinic and crazy as it sounds I'll have to fly across country for this FET. When I had my Aug & Oct attempts my RE wasnt at all happy with the embryo quality and after the heartbreak of 2 more BFNs I couldnt just say \"thats it then\". We felt that our \"last chance\" was stunted from the get go when they thawed and werent good. So the search began and we did find a clinic without a 2-3 year waiting list - but the catch is they're on the other side of the country. So we adopted a batch that is remarkably similar to both of us, but unfortunately there are just 3 and they're slow frozen at 3 day. The RE did say that this batch has a good history, but my nerves are shot already, lol. I've got my unopened pack of BCPs just sitting and waiting and as soon as AF arrives I should get my schedule - eeek then I'll really be nervous, lol. I love how we'll get to hold each other's hand for this nerve wracking process - and its going to work for both of us! I insist on it, lol. Do you have a schedule yet? You've got a lot of cheerleaders Franny!! - xoxo\n\nKatie, I am also just waiting for AF...although I know I have a few more weeks. I didn't get a schedule..I just had all my meds ordered today, and was told to call with cycle day 1. Like I said I have no idea what to really expect, but way less meds and injections, and way less SnS's makes me a lot happier. This new clinic I am at is all about meditation and acupuncture. They have a healing arts center attached to it, and they must pump some kind of sedative in the vents because I was really calm and relaxed (for the most part) during my procedures, and I'm always a nervous nelly!\n\nI don't think it's strange to go across the country to get your babies at all!!! I got mine, and then moved my whole life to be closer to them so who am I to judge? hahaI think it's amazing that you want to give Ryan a sibling, and I know this is our time!!! You have no idea how happy I am to be able to talk about this with you again.\n\nWell I can only go by my last schedule, but from what I remember is was something like 2-3 weeks on BCPs then start estrace ( maybe 10-15 days of that?) then PIO starts 5 days before a blast transfer ( 3 days if its a 3d transfer) and baby aspirin and doxy and medrol until FET. Of course this new clinic prefers estrogen via injection so that'll be new for me, but on the plus side they'd rather I use crinone 2x day instead of PIO. With my old clinic I had to do both and as much as I hate those lumps I'm a bit concerned that last time my P4 levels were so low. Ahhh, we didnt even start yet and the questions and anxieties begin already, lol. Missed you girl..\n\nFranny it is so wonderful hearing from you. Of course we remember you!!! I have often wondered how you were doing. You have been such an inspiration for many of us...especially me and I have missed your positive attitude so much. I am so happy to hear that you are back with us and this will work for you If there is anything I have noticed on this board is that sooner or later it does work for all of us. Best of luck to you sweety. I have to wait a few months since my baby was born via c section but I plan to join in around July.\n\nahhhhh, FRANNY!!!!! I am so happy you are back. Obviously you touched alot of people and anyone who cycled with you would remember you! I still hang on these boards occasionally, just to check on past cycle sisters and I have become a silent stalker to some of the girls who's journey keep me coming back, waiting for a happy ending (leorira, I am talking about you girl). Congrats on adopting your embies, I will now start stalking you! It is your time girl!\n\nKatie99,\n\nI am so glad you are trying again for a sib for Ryan! Interesting you gotta fly, but it will be well worth it!\n\nAre you doing Lupron with your FET or just taking estrace and they will monitor your natural surge?? I did Lupron with Mady and it worked well for me because it took so long for my darn lining to get thick so I literally was on estrogen for a month until I started the PIO shots!! I love the idea of a clinic that encourages mediation and acupuncture!! Relaxed during a proceedure?!?!? That sounds so foreign to me\n\nHow many embies do you have and how many are you transferring? Are they 3d or 5d embies?\n\nI can't tell you how excited I am for you Katie99!!!! Um...yes to a get together in New York or New Jersey!!! My best friend from college lives in Clifton Park and I try and visit her at least once a year and we meet up at Woodbury Commons once or twice a year so it's definitely possible!!!\n\nRhonda-so good to hear from you hon!!! How are your beautiful girls?!?!\n\nAFM-Tomorrow we go to see the heart beat so I'm nervous, excited, anxious, and everything you can imagine!!"
