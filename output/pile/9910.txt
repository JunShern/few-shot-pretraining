    "text": "We left on a Wednesday. The papers were signed and the day would soon be here. I was going to lose my family. Mom and Dad were getting a divorce and we were on our way to Grandma\u2019s. I was 17.\n\nI packed up my car and I was the last one to leave that day. I will always remember watching dad stand on the porch with tears in his eyes looking at his oldest son and he only had one question.\n\n\u201cPromise you will come see me Jason?\u201d Dad asked.\n\nBefore I drove away, I made a choice, I looked at my father with a smile on my face as I held back the tears not to let him see his boy crying. I said to him, \u201cOf course dad. I promise I\u2019ll come back and see you.\u201d\n\nAfter that all was left were the tail lights in his vision and the man who raised me for 17 years left behind, alone on the porch, crying as he waved goodbye. Little did I know those would be the last words I ever spoke to my father. I couldn\u2019t imagine he would be gone so quickly.\n\nDo I really need to struggle the way my parents did or still do? Am I worthy of anything more than what I have been given? Can I really make the changes in my life I desire? How can I ever move past the negative voices in my life, in my own head? Am I forever doomed to this life of misery as another cog in the machine?\n\nI read all the books from Brene Brown, Steven Pressfield, John Eldridge, Dan Miller, Jon Acuff, and Dave Ramsey searching for these answers. It wasn't until I hit rock bottom that I found them. On a cold fall night caged up like a lion when John asked me one question....\n\nHere lies the key to your future.\n\nThat night I began the journey to answer these 5 questions. A journey of personal transformation that has led me to the life I live today as a Speaker, Coach, Author, and most importantly Husband and Father. The Confident Father's Guidebook has lead me there Listen as you discover and uncover the questions in your life that will lead to your transformation and enjoy the gift of these 5 steps that will allow you to rediscover who and what matters most in your life.\n\nThere are only two days that matter most in the life of a man. 1.

This book is the road to finding your own path to reaching that level in life if day number three has yet to come upon you. That is my gift to you.\n\nChapter 2: Father Daughter Conversations\n\nI can't raise a daughter. I need time alone to figure this father thing out. Will she ever talk to me and tell me how she feels?
