    "text": "Posting settings question.. PHOTO ADDED IN COMMENT\n\nToday at a 1st birthday party I played around taking some pictures in Manual because the lighting wasn't working in Auto and I thought since it wasn't a session (so to speak) then was as good a time as any to play around.\n\nSo, now in order to post for CC I know you all ask for settings, once you take the picture how do you find out what your settings were? I can't remember what I used and I think I changed it a few times since I was experimenting. Help!\n\nCute little girl. That paper thing in front is distracting, that is where my attention goes. It would have been nice to see your whole subject. Your SS was good, you were able to avoid getting any blur that way. And for having such a high ISO its not noisy.\n\nI do think it's a nice picture, with a little edit tweaking it a keeper! cute kiddo <3\n\nThe ISO is a\u00c2 high, about 800 and above you start getting grainy. So in the future I would lower that.I am not sure how the lighting was, I change my WB usually rather then up the ISO in a floursant light type situation but to each his own, some do the opposite.\n\n1/200 is pretty close, I usually set mine to 1/250 with toddlers.\n\nThe fstop depends on if you were shooting with a kit lens etc. I usually go lower but most kit lens don't go much lower. The lower the number the more light you let in, which is how you get bokeh ( blurry background)\n\nI did use a flash because her mom put her right in front of a window that had the sun blaring right in. The black stuff is beadboard and some of that glare may have been from the other 10 people in front of the little girl snapping pictures lol. (You know how family gets with 1 year olds!)\u00c2\n\nThe paper thing was a decoration and I kind of just snapped whatever I could to practice with the Manual mode. I've been playing around with it more often.\n\nIt seemed that if I lowered the ISO it got really dark, but maybe it was the lighting. Not only was there a window with direct light right behind her, there was virtually no other lighting in the place (very awful building for pictures). \u00c2\n\n\u00c2\n\nBut, I'm bringing this little girl in for her very own personal (only me shooting) smash cake session in a couple weeks (for practice and for better pictures for mama!)\n\nThere is a way to blur out the paper puffball with a kit lens, and keep the little girl in view...unfortunately you were working in some less than camera friendly conditions. What did you meter off of? And does your camera have flash fill, dialing down the power of the flash may have helped a little, but kudos for playing around in Manual...PP is right....it does get easier the more you use it. Maybe you can clone the darker part of beadboard over the glary flashed part, maybe you can turn this into an edit contest."
