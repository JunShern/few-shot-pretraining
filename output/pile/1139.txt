The videographers of Duckball home video have put together a well-rounded, 68-minute program describing the Society for Creative Anachronism and the Pennsic War. This video is a definite \"must-have\" for the SCAdian library. It is the largest and most complete documentary ever released of the Pennsic war, containing the woods, field, castle, and belted champions battles, several tournaments, music by Jack-In-The-Green and others, peerage ceremonies, opening and closing ceremonies, courts, the fools parade, classes, archery, artisans, shopping, and interviews with some of the early founders of Pennsic and the SCA, along with younger members who have since gone on to become peers and royalty. It is not only a wonderful document of this historic event, but also an ideal introduction to the SCA, useful at demos, meetings, or just showing people what you do for a hobby.\n\nOriginally shot on Super-VHS and Hi-8 video, this program was digitally remastered and duplicated on a high-quality, hi-fi DVD. It is a SCA documentary of the highest order!\n\nThis special edition also includes a 48-minute bonus feature of \"lost\" footage. This footage is edited to concentrate subject matters, so that all the music is together, all the fighting is together, all the courts are together, and so forth.\n\nThere is also an informative \"where-are-they-now\" insert included updating the stories of some of the gentles who were interviewed, many of whom have since become knights, laurels, kings, and queens! It also tells the story behind the making of this video.\n\nPeople also appearing include:\nKing David and Queen Tanguistl\nKing Randal and Queen Katherine\nKing of Calontir\nKing of The Outlands\nMistress Morgana\nAndrixos\nDawid Zyugury\nMaster Alan\nKing Inman\nSir Alexander Caithness of Wick\nFulk the Wyvern\nEdward Dragonslayer\nErvald the Optimistic"
