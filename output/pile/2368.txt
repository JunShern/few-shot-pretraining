The three earnest young men burdened with plastic bags came to the office bearing food. Pretzels with seeds. A snack bar. An energy bar. Tortilla chips.Never mind the caloric sin. We're talking serious evil here. Or so the government says.\nUnless you are an avid reader of the Federal Register and perused the tiny print of almost undecipherable bureaucratese on pages 51,539 through 51,544, you might have missed it -- but the government has returned to normal.The Drug Enforcement Administration, under the direction of Asa Hutchinson, the former GOP congressman from Arkansas, has announced rules to ban certain brands of a wide variety of foods -- \"beer, cheese, coffee, corn chips, energy drink, flour, ice cream, snack bars, salad oil, soda and veggie burgers\" -- if they contain trace amounts of THC.THC, as those who came to the age of majority in the 1960s know well, is tetrahydrocannabinols. As DEA succinctly explains: \"That's the hallucinogenic substance in marijuana that causes the psychoactive effect or high.\"The THC found in certain brands of the above-mentioned food comes from hempseeds and hempseed oil, popular with some so-called \"natural food\" manufacturers because they are high in protein and serve as a fatty acid supplement -- \"good fats\" that doctors like. But DEA says such foods are now controlled substances illegal for everyone. Makers of foods with hempseeds or oil, with $5 million in annual sales, argue that the amount of THC is so infinitesimal that inhumanly high consumption of them would be required to get high. They liken it to getting a buzz from eating the opiate-containing poppy seeds on bagels or the alcohol in orange juice.But the Controlled Substances Act says that any consumption of THC is forbidden. And any food that contains it is no longer to be sold, distributed or eaten.Says the DEA: \"If you wish to err on the side of caution, you may freely dispose of the product. As stated in the rules that DEA published on Oct. 9, 2001, anyone who has purchased a food or beverage product that contains THC has 120 days (until Feb. 6, 2002) to dispose of the product without penalty under federal law.\"After Feb. 6, it will be illegal to sell or import any hemp-containing foods.The DEA, in its wisdom, notes that bird seed with cannabis seeds, clothing such as hats, shirt and shoes, cosmetics, lotion, paper, rope, twine and, yes, shampoo and soap, which also can contain hemp, are not illegal. \"Based on the information currently available, DEA believes that [such products] do not cause THC to enter the human body and are therefore legal.\"Confronted with the thought that the government's investing time, money and energy in such a campaign during a time of war is, possibly, ridiculous, Hutchinson says, \"Many Americans do not know that hemp and marijuana are both parts of the same plant and that hemp cannot be produced without producing marijuana.\"Not surprisingly, supporters of food with hempseed oil have gone to court, beseeching the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to block the DEA rule. DEA says it is permitted to issue the ban on THC-laced products without a formal rule-making procedure although the public may comment until Dec. 10. \"It's like the judge announcing the verdict before the trial,\" complained John Young, a lawyer for the hemp-food lawsuit, to the National Law Journal.Groups which are applauding the DEA's action, such as the conservative Family Research Council, say food with hempseeds sends a pro-drug message to children and is camouflage for a campaign to legalize marijuana.The other day, confronted by a man in Florida who said the government was not responding to his needs, President Bush muttered, \"I can't stand bureaucracy.\"Bush remembered the cameras were rolling and said that he appreciated \"the hard-working people who care enough to work for the government. But what I don't like is systems that get so cumbersome that those who are trying to help you don't get the product out.\"In the course of writing this, I have munched on the 120-calorie corn chips, the 220-calorie pretzels and devoured the 170-calorie snack bar. In truth, I feel nothing but my waistband.And a curious desire to watch \"Monty Python's Flying Circus.\"Note: The drug war blunders on: The DEA is cracking down on hempseed oil in tortilla chips.

You said a lot in your comment. It is a sad state of affairs how it is going in the USA. I find peace going out and throwing the ball for the dog. At night looking at the stars and how in order everything seems up there. Peace is something that no one can take from you. Corrie Ten Boom was a Christian lady who hide the Jews and she was at peace in all she did even though her life was seriously jeopardised. I pray that our Nation might be Blessed but I don't think we have been good enough to deserve a Blessing speaking on a spiritual level. I hope no one minds. Why should we as a Nation not suffer like other people have? Why do some of our leaders think we are better then any other Nation or Country? I just don't know. Today an army helicopter flew over and what a strange feeling since we haven't seen many planes even though they practice out here doing maneuvers. They haven't since 9-11. There's an old expression. Pride cometh before a fall. I wonder if we are headed for a big fall.\nPS: Good to have you back safe and sound.\n[ Post Comment ]\nComment #14 posted by dddd on December 09, 2001 at 20:51:57 PT\nback to reality\n...I spent the weekend camping at Joshua Tree National Monument.It's a very special place in the high desert of Southern California.It was quite cold ,especially at night,(elevation 5000 ft),,,but it's so beautiful,that the cold doesnt matter.At night,the galactic shine of the stars is quite astoundingly awesome.You can see galaxies with the naked eye....seeing it,is enough to make even the bitterest of hardcore atheiests think twice about questioning the reality of God....and,speakin' of God,,,,,the four hour drive from LA to get out there,is mostly along the same 4 and 6 lane freeway that leads to Palm Springs.It is lined with billboards and perpetually clogged with traffic.....I am to the point of sheer disgust,in seeing the masses of brainwashed sheeple with flags in their cars,and \"God bless America\",,United we stand\" bumper stickers,,, but what really enraged me,,was to see that uncle sam has been buying up billboard space to convey his bullshit of false unity....huge billboards with \"United we stand,and \"God bless America\",line the freeway .....think about it..\"God bless America\",,,is that asking God to bless America,,or telling him to do so? ..Perhaps if God refuses to bless America,Bush,and Ashcroft will consider him a terrorist,and bomb him,,and seize his assets???....furthermore,,,why should God bless America?I cant think of too many things that the Amerika,as represented by its' government,has done that it would deserve to be \"blessed\" for..?In fact,,it would be a blessing,if God would topple the beastly republicrat Evil Empire,,but that wont happen.. ...The Amerikan government of today,is starting to look alot like a Charles Manson,,it has persuaded millions of innocent people rally behind its' murder and mayhem,under a created illusion that somehow god is walking around in a red white and blue robe,waving a flag. ..\n...OK,,,to finally say a few things about the article....The absurdity of prohibition is really disturbing to begin with,,,but it really goes over the edge with the grotesque ban on hemp products.It's almost like they are seeing how far they can go,or what they can get away with,,,and it's becoming increasingly clear,,that they can get away with dam near anything nowdays.....after all,,the hemp ban issue appears somewhat insignificant,when compared to the brutal gang-rape of the Constitution.......and,,like I keep saying,,the only way they are able to pull all this shit off,,is because they control the press.......... And speakin' of the press,,,notice,,the latest silly ploy,is the false issue concerning;\"The Liberal biased media\"...What a pile of crap!...what a roose,,,what a masterful decoy,to further fake out the flocks.....dddd\n[ Post Comment ]\nComment #13 posted by FoM on December 09, 2001 at 20:33:13 PT\nNews Brief from The Associated Press\nTopless Women Draw Attention to Issues\nDecember 9, 2001, 10:00 AM\nBy AP Staff\nA group of women bared their chests in downtown Eugene to protest the effects of pesticides on their children and fight for legal hemp production.\nThe four women, who called themselves Mother Bares, said Saturday they were also protesting against multinational conglomerates and U.S. military action in Afghanistan.\n\"This is the mother energy that's coming out right now,\" said protester Eileen Erdelt.\nPolice Sgt.

Many Americans think that hemp and marijuana are the same exact thing and that it is possible to get high from a hemp plant.That is why all of the pro-hemp articles have to state every single time towards the beginning \"The hemp plant is from the same family as the marijuana plant, but does not contain enough of the active ingredient THC to get a person high.\"\n[ Post Comment ]\nComment #11 posted by boppy on December 09, 2001 at 08:22:49 PT\nI should proof read more closely...\nI meant to say \"those who fought desegregation...\" Sheesh! My apologies!\n[ Post Comment ]\nComment #10 posted by boppy on December 09, 2001 at 08:15:46 PT\nIt all reminds me of a time...\nThe DEA's attitude and the sheep who agree with them reminds me of the groups of people who fought segregation in the late 50's and early 60's. Their positions were absolutely indefensible and rooted simply in hate. That's exactly what we are encountering here. Blind, ignorant hate. In 1937 when Henry Anslinger who was head of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics contended that cannabis caused users to commit violence and other aggressive crimes and maintained that it provoked black men to molest white women, what were those opinions based on? Facts or hate? The FBN offered no proof of these claims. Did he sound like he was well informed or just perpetuating rascism and class war? The DEA is not to far removed from the attitudes of 1937.\n[ Post Comment ]\nComment #9 posted by The GCW on December 09, 2001 at 05:38:16 PT\nWould Jefferson, Kill these people responsible?\nThomas Jefferson is quoted: \"Hemp is of first necessity to the wealth and protection of the country.\"\nBush mutters.\n[ Post Comment ]\nComment #8 posted by E_Johnson on December 09, 2001 at 00:00:31 PT\nWe are a population in captivity\nThat song resonates with me now.

The Republican leadership clearly has a very bad disconnect from the American public on drug policy, the Bush administration is clearly controlled by the tiny minority of Drug Free pressure group extremists left in America.By 2004, after two more years of the leadership of this Drug Free Triumvirate, I expect that the DEA will have almost no public respect left in America, and the Democrats will be free to run whole hog with that in the election.And then Washington will be a different place for the DEA than it has been in the last several decades.If the people in this agency cannot realize that they are on a mission of self-destruction with this hemp food ban, then God bless them and let them continue on their foolish prideful path.\n[ Post Comment ]\nComment #1 posted by E_Johnson on December 08, 2001 at 12:43:29 PT\nAgit prop theater by Mullah Ashcroft\nIf I had hired an agit-prop theater company to perform an absurdist drama on all of the potentially ridiculous consequences of marijuana prohibition, I could not have found any revolutionary agit-prop troupe in the WORLD that could have put together a more absurd and shocking performance this the one starring the DEA, directed by Mullah Ashcroft and his sidekick, Osama Bin Hutchinson.Their revolutionary performance of \"Why the Schedule I status of marijuana is absurd\" is breaking new ground in educatiing ordinary citizens about the Controlled Subsatcnes Acr and the power it has to intrude into human dignity and defeat the everyday instincts of basic morality and ethics in this country.\n[ Post Comment ]\nPost Comment"
