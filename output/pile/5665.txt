Ray, Press Council of India\n\n\u201cUltimately, the superintendence of elections rests with the EC and it should look into \u2018paid news\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u2014Rajdeep Sardesai, Editors Guild\n\n***\n\nIt was April last year and the general elections had just been announced when marketing whiz kids in the media saw a golden opportunity springing up. Poll campaigns had begun to roll out and they ran the whole gamut, from asking politicians to pay a premium for favourable reports to flattering interviews on TV to running down opponents who refused to oblige. In essence, media marketers worked overtime to milk netas and political parties, raking in the moolah even at a time when the general economy was reeling under a severe recession.\n\nAdvertisement opens in new window\n\nWhile it is generally believed that the malaise of publishing news in return for money had kicked in way back in General Elections 2004, it was the scale of the phenomenon of paid news in 2009 that made many wake up and take notice. This has now forced statutory bodies like the Press Council of India (PCI) and the Election Commission of India to take note and try to set in place \u201cguidelines\u201d to rein in the practice. Chief election commissioner Navin Chawla says that \u201cthe EC proposes to convene a meeting of recognised national political parties shortly to discuss the issue\u201d. The PCI has called for a meeting with editors of leading national dailies on January 12. The Editors Guild will also be seeking an appointment with the Election Commission to discuss the issue.\n\nThere will be many questions on the agenda when the EC and the PCI hold discussions on the \u2018paid news\u2019 syndrome. Sale of editorial space is lucrative business even though it compromises on objectivity. How, then, is one to ensure that the news in the day\u2019s papers is not paid for. More importantly, how can editors and managements be persuaded to keep a distinction between news, advertising and marketing supplements?\n\nAdvertisement opens in new window\n\nBut for things to even get off the ground, the body entrusted with the mandate of watching over the media has to have some teeth. It is widely agreed that the Press Council has very little powers, apart from issuing strictures against publications. In effect, its writ has no legal standing even if it identifies an unhealthy trend in the media.\n\nJustice G.N. Ray, who heads the council, had even earlier expressed concern at the malaise of paid news. \u201cThe rot has set in in the system and, unfortunately, language papers emulated the leading papers, which had started the paid-news trend...this reached a peak during the recent elections. But the Press Council is trying to assert itself,\u201d he says. Now the council is in consultations with the Election Commission and will be examining the issue. The Press Council is, however, still in the process of collecting and examining \u201cpaid news items\u201d, for which it has set up a committee.\n\nMeanwhile, what is the Election Commission doing? In its note to the PCI on December 16, it has acknowledged that it received \u201cinformal\u201d complaints from politicians but also admitted that some of its proposed recommendations have not been acted upon by the government of India. The commission cites an instance in which a \u201cnational daily\u201d, on being asked to furnish details of a surrogate advertisement, refused to oblige. \u201cOn the face of it, such advertisements give an impression of a genuine news report covering the election campaign of a particular candidate. But when such reports repeatedly appear in a newspaper, more or less on a regular basis, the matter does give rise to doubts about whether it was honest coverage,\u201d the note from the commission said. Incidentally, a bjp delegation met the CEC recently and submitted a memorandum asking the commission to probe the Ashok Chavan/Maharashtra elections imbroglio, which sparked off the whole paid-news imbroglio.\n\nAdvertisement opens in new window\n\nAgain, while the rules governing the Representation of People\u2019s Act (RPA), 1951, clearly state that no person shall print or cause to be printed any election pamphlet or poster unless a declaration as to the identity of the publisher thereof, signed by him and attested by two persons to whom he is personally known, is delivered by him to the printer in duplicate and handed to the chief electoral officer or the district magistrate\u2014the note states that rarely are copies of posters etc furnished to the district magistrate. Quite clearly, it is the EC that needs to be reminded of its own responsibility at the time of elections, because its writ runs supreme.\n\nInterestingly, the commission has directed the PCI to determine what is paid news, so that the expenditure on such news becomes accountable. Sources in the EC admitted that they did not wish to be seen as overstepping their limits. \u201cOur role only comes into play once the election dates are announced and the model code of conduct kicks in,\u201d a senior official in the commission told Outlook.\n\nAdvertisement opens in new window\n\nBut as was noted during the assembly elections in Andhra Pradesh, politicians complained bitterly that the Election Commission did not give adequate importance to the issue. CEC Navin Chawla admitted to receiving complaints from political parties. \u201cThe phenomena of \u2018paid news\u2019 is one of increasing concern for the Election Commission, especially during the run-up to elections. We are awaiting the proceedings of the Press Council of India\u2019s recent meeting in this regard. The Editors Guild is coming to see us on this subject shortly. If readers lose faith in the printed word, especially at election time, then an important pillar of democracy will stand compromised,\u201d Chawla says.\n\nBut Paranjoy Guha Thakurta, member of the two-man inquiry committee set up by the Press Council to examine paid news, asks, \u201cHow does one prove that a monetary transaction has taken place? All such transactions are clandestine and one can only go by circumstantial evidence.\u201d The council has invited editors of leading publications on January 11 to put in place a mechanism of check and balances. Rajdeep Sardesai, president of the Editors Guild, says, \u201cUltimately, the superintendence of the elections rests with the Election Commission and it should look into \u2018paid news\u2019.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement opens in new window\n\nIronically, the EC had recommended a crucial change in the RPA, which could have gone some way to ensure that advertisements and news are distinct from each other. \u201cIn the case of advertisements/election matter for or against any political party or candidate in the print media during the election period, the name and address of the publisher should be given along with the material/advertisement,\u201d the Commission had suggested. Till date, the government has not responded.\n\nSo, will the current exercise in reining in paid news pay any dividends? Most in the industry feel that unless changes are made in the RPA and organisations like the PCI are given powers, there will be no significant change. Perhaps newspapers and TV channels may become more careful in selling editorial space. But business, many say, will go on.\n\nPost a Comment\n\nI don't know why such a hue and cry NOW only, and about \"paid news\" only. Another one of the many ways to corrupt the press is to give them very expensive , genuine advertisements: e.g., on the inaguration of a railway station in some remote area (say, in the North East), by some cOnGRESS person. The full page ad will appear in some national newspaper, in its Delhi edition, on the morning of the same day as the scheduled inauguration. \"All are welcome\" to attend the inauguration.\n\nWhen our MPs and MLAs are paid for their vote even on nationally important issues, what more hell is going to happen if news are paid for? For sure our freedom has been vandalised by feudal family interests who are perpetually in power. Corruption is tolerated at all levels and the system allows the corrupt to continue in power even trial based on prima facie evidence goes on endlessly in courts. See the present scenario despite food prices sky rocketing, the voters can hardly do anything democratically to force our legislatures (many of them having vast business interests) to arrest it. Congress need not fear till next general elections and by that time will come out with another great 'waiver' thamasha. Till such time we get the right to call back our worthless reps and we limit their service to two terms, this tragedy will continue.\n\nIt has been a well acknowledged fact of selection of 'KHAS' reporters and correspondents to help out and report flattering news of the contesting candidate as seen in all recent elections of the country. Ask Mr. Vinod Mehta any candidate on 'moral oath' whether he be it a winner or a loser did not go for the press on such counts? T. Vinod\n\nThe media lacks objectivity in the first place.It usually favours one political party or other in pursuance of its own political agenda.So,when the media prostitutes itself in this fashion it is no big deal if it does such things for money.\n\n>There are limitations to what governmental bodies can do to exclude paid news from the news-space.\n\nThere are umpteen numbers of ways government can do to control the wayward media & its excesses. Question is whether govrnments have any intention to do so. Absolutely no. Media on the other hand serves as an impotant adjunct to government misdeeds.\n\nFor example never before overall governance standards fell to such appalling low as it is now during the current regime & its vegitating head who seems have taken a hands off policy in all matters of governmance. This old gentleman with his antedeluvial economic sense & with no faith in welfare state, only becomes hyperactive only in when matters which serve the interest of money bags & a superpower. 90% percent of his cabinetis packed with representatives of special interest groups - some mining, some aviation, some energy, some real estate, some telecom, some sugar & the list is endless.It was alwyas so, but has never been so blatant , all pervasive & so corruptive.\n\nBy diverting & refocussing on perepherial issues such sexual escapades of politicians or a particular criminal police officer , media takes off the heat off politicians from common man, the beast of burden which is reeling under the pressure of 30% increase in prices of essentials.You will not hear or see a whip of mention in media about this unprecedented engineered price rise of essentials .\n\nSo media & degenerating politicians are in cahoots. Thinking that government at all wants to control media is simplistic.\n\nWhat is the point discussing about smaller language print/tv channels? Just look at so called national dailies/tv channels specially English language? There are enough media took interview of Priyanka Vadra just before the general election talking about her father\u2019s killer? What was that? I am sure everybody know it is method of publicity to garner sympathy vote? What about CNNIBN? Their whole profiling of politicians?\nWhy gun down smaller mediums? What about VM himself? Sometimes it is paid by Indian politicians and some other times by some global vested interest parties!\n\nThere are limitations to what governmental bodies can do to exclude paid news from the news-space. There are all kinds of ways to avoid being caught. It is up to the press itself to monitor and regulate itself. It is also up to an intelligent readership to shun corrupt outlets. The power of money is overwhelming. Look what it has done to the U.S. Congress!"
