    "text": "Peo\u00adple get the chance to record the song that means most to them in a heart\u00adwarm\u00ading new show\n\nThe 60s were in their in\u00adfancy when Ge\u00adorge \u2018Joey\u2019 Spruce led his band off-stage at The Cav\u00adern Club in Liver\u00adpool and ex\u00adchanged a few words with the ner\u00advous singer pre\u00adpar\u00ading to go on. \u2018We\u2019d done a few songs I\u2019d writ\u00adten my\u00adself, and he said how good they were. I said, \u201cHave you writ\u00adten any your\u00adself?\u201d And he said, \u201cWe have, but they\u2019re not that good,\u201d\u2019 re\u00adcalls Joey, laugh\u00ading.\n\nLit\u00adtle won\u00adder, given that the young man was Paul McCart\u00adney. Yes, that Paul McCart\u00adney. \u2018I mean, those songs then went on to be\u00adcome some of the most fa\u00admous in the world,\u2019 says Joey, now 75. \u2018But at the time none of us had any idea.\u2019\n\nThe Bea\u00adtles be\u00adcame le\u00adgends of course, Joey\u2019s band less so. Earl Pre\u00adston And The TTs are still fondly re\u00admem\u00adbered by a cer\u00adtain gen\u00ader\u00ada\u00adtion in their na\u00adtive Liver\u00adpool, but world\u00adwide fame eluded them. Joey and the sur\u00adviv\u00ading mem\u00adbers of his band got an un\u00adex\u00adpected chance to re\u00adlive their glory days, how\u00adever, when they were asked to take part in a new TV show that sees un\u00adlikely singers cut their very own record in a record\u00ading stu\u00addio.\n\nThis Is My Song, a heart\u00adwarm\u00ading two-parter, gives mem\u00adbers of the pub\u00adlic a chance to make a record that is spe\u00adcial to them, for what\u00adever rea\u00adson. All sorts of sto\u00adries \u2013 some tear\u00adjerk\u00aders \u2013 are told in the process. One of the most up\u00adlift\u00ading ones comes from Charles Michael Duke, 23. He was born with cys\u00adtic fi\u00adbro\u00adsis, and had just had a dou\u00adble lung trans\u00adplant af\u00adter three years on the wait\u00ading list. See\u00ading him sing Ella Hen\u00adder\u00adson\u2019s Yours, backed by a full choir, will have you reach\u00ading for the tis\u00adsues.\n\nThen there\u2019s Matt Bond, 26, who plays bass gui\u00adtar in the in\u00addie band Blue River. He takes the lead spot as a singer for the first time with a ren\u00addi\u00adtion of Bas\u00adket Case by Green Day. And what\u2019s his mo\u00adti\u00adva\u00adtion? He has a pro\u00adnounced stam\u00admer when speak\u00ading \u2013 but not when singing, and he wanted to raise aware\u00adness of the prob\u00adlem.\n\nFor Joey Spruce though, the ap\u00adpear\u00adance was a trip down mem\u00adory lane. \u2018I hadn\u2019t been in a record\u00ading stu\u00addio for years \u2013 and never one like this,\u2019 he says. \u2018At first the other lads were a bit Charles in the vo\u00adcal booth, record\u00ading his spe\u00adcial track funny about do\u00ading it, but I said to them, \u201cWhen are we, at our age, likely to be in\u00advited on TV again?\u201d\u2019\n\nJoey was pretty ner\u00advous though. He\u2019s been through the mill health-wise re\u00adcently, fight\u00ading prostate cancer, and hadn\u2019t sung for five years un\u00adtil tak\u00ading part in this pro\u00adject. \u2018My con\u00adfi\u00addence took a real hit be\u00adcause of my ill\u00adness,\u2019 he ad\u00admits. \u2018I was a bag of nerves, but I\u2019m glad I did it. It was fan\u00adtas\u00adtic to be back with the guys, with that mic in front of me. And to have an ac\u00adtual copy of the record we cut too. It\u2019s a lovely thing to have.\u2019\n\nThe show is touch\u00ading , with the sur\u00adviv\u00ading band mem\u00adbers lay\u00ading down in\u00adstru\u00admen\u00adtal tracks and vo\u00adcals for Will You Still Love Me To\u00admor\u00adrow. All their wives are al\u00adlowed into the stu\u00addio for the fi\u00adnal per\u00adfor\u00admance \u2013 and the tears flow all round. \u2018It was magic,\u2019 says Joey. \u2018What a thing for the grand\u00adchil\u00addren to watch.\u2019\n\nJoey (cen\u00adtre) record\u00ading vo\u00adcals, with three of his band\u00admates from Earl Pre\u00adston And The TTs. Right: the band in 1963"
