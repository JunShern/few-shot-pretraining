Senerth, Muller Brazil, LLP, Dresher, PA, for Petitioner.\n\nLinda Sara Renzi, U.S. Department of Justice, Washington, DC, for Respondent.\n\n                       DECISION ON ATTORNEY\u2019S FEES AND COSTS1\n\n        On April 6, 2018, Victoria Ditsche filed a petition for compensation under the\nNational Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7300aa-10, et seq.,2 (the\n\u201cVaccine Act\u201d). Petitioner alleges that she suffered a Shoulder Injury Related to Vaccine\nAdministration as a result of an influenza vaccine administered on November 23, 2016.\n(Petition at 1). On October 18, 2019, a decision was issued awarding compensation to\nPetitioner based on the Respondent\u2019s proffer. (ECF No. 41).\n\n\n\n1  Because this unpublished Decision contains a reasoned explanation for the action in this case, I am\nrequired to post it on the United States Court of Federal Claims' website in accordance with the E-\nGovernment Act of 2002. 44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3501 note (2012) (Federal Management and Promotion of Electronic\nGovernment Services). This means the Decision will be available to anyone with access to the\ninternet. In accordance with Vaccine Rule 18(b), Petitioner has 14 days to identify and move to redact\nmedical or other information, the disclosure of which would constitute an unwarranted invasion of privacy.\nIf, upon review, I agree that the identified material fits within this definition, I will redact such material from\npublic access.\n\n2\n National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-660, 100 Stat. 3755. Hereinafter, for\nease of citation, all \u201c\u00a7\u201d references to the Vaccine Act will be to the pertinent subparagraph of 42 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 300aa (2012).\n\f       Petitioner has now filed a motion for attorney\u2019s fees and costs, dated January 29,\n2020 (ECF No. 46), requesting a total award of $12,679.59 (representing $12,078.90 in\nfees and $600.69 in costs). In accordance with General Order #9 counsel for Petitioner\nrepresents that Petitioner incurred no out-of-pocket expenses. (Id. at 2). Respondent\nreacted to the motion on January 30, 2020 indicating that he is satisfied that the statutory\nrequirements for an award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs are met in this case and defers to\nthe Court\u2019s discretion to determine the amount to be awarded. (ECF No. 47). Petitioner\ndid not file a reply.\n\n       I have reviewed the billing records submitted with Petitioner\u2019s request. In my\nexperience, the request appears reasonable, and I find no cause to reduce the requested\nhours or rates.\n\n                                        ANALYSIS\n\n        The Vaccine Act permits an award of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs. \u00a7\n15(e). Counsel must submit fee requests that include contemporaneous and specific\nbilling records indicating the service performed, the number of hours expended on the\nservice, and the name of the person performing the service. See Savin v. Sec\u2019y of Health\n& Human Servs., 85 Fed. Cl. 313, 316-18 (2008). Counsel should not include in their fee\nrequests hours that are \u201cexcessive, redundant, or otherwise unnecessary.\u201d Saxton v.\nSec\u2019y of Health & Human Servs., 3 F.3d 1517, 1521 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (quoting Hensley v.\nEckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 434 (1983)). It is \u201cwell within the special master\u2019s discretion to\nreduce the hours to a number that, in [her] experience and judgment, [is] reasonable for\nthe work done.\u201d Id. at 1522. Furthermore, the special master may reduce a fee request\nsua sponte, apart from objections raised by respondent and without providing a petitioner\nnotice and opportunity to respond. See Sabella v. Sec\u2019y of Health & Human Servs., 86\nFed. Cl. 201, 209 (2009). A special master need not engage in a line-by-line analysis of\npetitioner\u2019s fee application when reducing fees. Broekelschen v. Sec\u2019y of Health &\nHuman Servs., 102 Fed. Cl. 719, 729 (2011).\n\n       The petitioner \u201cbears the burden of establishing the hours expended, the rates\ncharged, and the expenses incurred.\u201d Wasson v. Sec\u2019y of Health & Human Servs., 24 Cl.\nCt. at 482, 484 (1991). The Petitioner \u201cshould present adequate proof [of the attorney\u2019s\nfees and costs sought] at the time of the submission.\u201d Id. at 484 n.1. Petitioner\u2019s counsel\n\u201cshould make a good faith effort to exclude from a fee request hours that are excessive,\nredundant, or otherwise unnecessary, just as a lawyer in private practice ethically is\nobligated to exclude such hours from his fee submission.\u201d Hensley, 461 U.S., at 434.\n\n                                             2\n\f                                       ATTORNEY FEES\n\n               A. Hourly Rates\n\n       Petitioner requests the following rates of compensation for the work of his\nattorneys Max Muller; $300.00 per hour for 2017, $317 per hour for 2018 and Amy\nSenerth; $225.00 per hour for work performed in 2017, $233.00 per hour for work\nperformed in 2018, and $250.00 for work performed in 2019. (ECF No. 46 at 1). Petitioner\nalso requests rates ranging from $125.00 per hour to $165.00 per hour for paralegal work,\ndepending on the individual paralegal and the year of the work. (Id). The rates requested\nare consistent with what Muller Brazil attorneys and paralegals have been awarded for\ntheir work in the Vaccine Program. Accordingly, no adjustment to the requested rates is\nnecessary.\n\n      For time billed in 2020, Ms. Senerth is requesting the increased rate of $275.00\nper hour. Based on my experience I find the requested increase for time billed in 2020 to\nbe reasonable and award it herein.\n\n                                      ATTORNEY COSTS\n\n       Petitioner requests $600.69 in overall costs. (ECF No. 46 at 1). This amount is\ncomprised of obtaining medical records and the Court\u2019s filing fee. I have reviewed all of\nthe requested costs and find the overall amount to be reasonable and shall award it in\nfull.\n\n                                         CONCLUSION\n\n       The Vaccine Act permits an award of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs. \u00a7\n15(e). Accordingly, I hereby GRANT Petitioner\u2019s Motion for attorney\u2019s fees and costs. I\naward a total of $12,679.59 (representing $12,078.90 in fees and $600.69 in costs) as a\nlump sum in the form of a check jointly payable to Petitioner and Petitioner\u2019s counsel. In\nthe absence of a timely-filed motion for review (see Appendix B to the Rules of the Court),\nthe Clerk shall enter judgment in accordance with this decision.3\n\n\n\n\n3 Pursuant to Vaccine Rule 11(a), the parties may expedite entry of judgment by filing a joint notice\nrenouncing their right to seek review.\n                                                 3\n\fIT IS SO ORDERED.\n\n                        s/Brian H. Corcoran\n                        Brian H. Corcoran\n                        Chief Special Master\n\n\n\n\n                    4\n\f"
