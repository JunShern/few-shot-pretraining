Now I am wanting to add some extra features into it and have it as a paid app. Now I am wondering if I have to create a whole new program or will changing the existing package name and export key suffice? Thanks\n\nA:\n\nGoogle Play does not allow you to change a free app to a paid app. The reasons behind it are beyond me. You have to upload a new app with a new package name onto Google Play. In eclipse right click on the project and select \"Android Tools -> Rename Application Package\". You don't have to create a new keystore to export the app, you can use the same you used for the previous one.\n\n"
