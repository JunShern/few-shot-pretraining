    "text": "HEADPHONES ARE getting smarter. Outfitted with fancy electronics, such as sensors and digital-signal processors, some are ready to respond to touch gestures or adapt their sound exactly to your liking. Others\u20143-D printed to quickly create one-off models tailored to your body\u2014are challenging long-held notions about form.\n\nThis evolution is perhaps to be expected. As more music moves onto the smartphone, headphones are leveraging that touch-screen interface and processing power. Parrot\u2019s Zik 2.0 headphones, for example, can pull off all manner of psychoacoustic wizardry, but the accompanying app is what makes controlling the Zik\u2019s dizzying number of settings possible.\n\nWhile standard headphones have a fixed sound profile that never changes once they leave the factory, models like the Zik 2.0, Alpine and ROAM Ropes allow you to adjust the EQ\u2014the balance of highs, mids and lows\u2014and save that setting directly to the headphones themselves. (Although some existing smartphone apps also let you adjust EQ, they only work with music stored on the device; if you use Spotify or another streaming service, the settings are lost.)\n\nAs yet, there\u2019s only a small selection of this smarter breed of headphones; the idea is still in its infancy. But once you try one, it\u2019s hard to get excited about less adept models again. Here, a look at four of the most capable that are on the market now\u2014or coming soon.\n\nAlpine Headphones\n\nWith their chrome trim, cushy headband and ear cups as plush as a La-Z-Boy, the Alpines are the equivalent of the thumping sound system you\u2019d find in a pimped-out car. This pair has its own digital amplifiers on board, and the center of the headband is outfitted with a bass transducer (powered by a dedicated amp) that\u2019s designed to vibrate the ear cups and the headband itself to maximize low-frequency punch. Audiophiles may scoff, but there\u2019s no denying that these provide a more visceral, physical experience when listening to hip-hop, electronic dance music and other bass-heavy genres. A free companion app (for iOS only) lets you tweak those lows\u2014and other frequencies\u2014as you see fit. $300, alpineheadphones.com"
