She said on Wednesday that the campaign is seeking guidance from federal regulators on how to update the old reports.\n\nOn Thursday she added: \u201cAs Senator Cruz has said before, he used his personal savings to help fund his Senate campaign - it has been widely reported in the past. He did so by liquidating his savings, selling stocks and borrowing against an equity account.\n\n\u201cThese transactions have been reported in one way or another on his many public financial disclosures and the Senate campaign\u2019s FEC reports. While the details of these transactions have been entirely transparent for years, it has come to our attention that one of these transactions may inadvertently not have been listed exactly the way the FEC requires.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cWe are going to contact the FEC to determine if that\u2019s the case, and, if necessary, we\u2019ll be happy to update the reports from the 2012 election cycle.\u201d\n\nCruz learned he should have disclosed the loans as part of his fundraising from a New York Times reporter, who published a story on the matter late on Wednesday. The Times described the loans as totaling as much as $1m from Goldman and Citibank and said they were paid down in late 2012. Frazier did not dispute those details.\n\nFrazier said Cruz has made no secret of the loans, pointing to their disclosure later in separate personal financial reports required of all federal elected officials.\n\nYet Cruz has never mentioned the loans on the 2016 campaign trail. Instead, he has said that he and his wife liquidated \u201cour entire net worth\u201d to finance his underdog Senate bid."
