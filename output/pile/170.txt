    "text": "O'Brien made these claims in the TranceFormation of America (1995) and Access Denied: For Reasons of National Security (2004) which she co-authored with Mark Phillips.[6] O'Brien is one of many people publicly claiming to have survived government-sponsored mind control programs.\n\nO'Brien claims to have been abused since she was a toddler. Forced to partake in satanic sadomasochistic child pornography movies produced for Gerald Ford, she was eventually sold to the CIA, which was looking for traumatized children for their mind-control program ... U.S. Presidents Ford, [and many other world leaders] all sexually brutalized her. She recounts in graphic detail how the elder George Bush raped her thirteen year old daughter and how she was forced to have oral sex with Illuminati witch Hillary Clinton ... While being sodomized, whipped, bound and raped, O'Brien overheard the globalist elite planning a military coup in the United States and conspiring to usher in the satanic New World Order. (Gardell, 97-98)\n\nOn websites, O'Brien claims she was rescued in 1988, which suggests that her daughter Kelly was no more than eight years old when last abused. Phillips stated in a Granada Forum lecture in 1996 that Kelly was in fact institutionalized when she was eight and has been raised in a mental institution.\n\nAlthough he has since distanced himself from studies in mind control, licensed psychologist Corydon Hammond seems to confirm as credible accounts similar to O'Brien's in a speech he delivered on June 25, 1992 at at the Fourth Annual Eastern Regional Conference on Abuse and Multiple Personality entitled \"Hypnosis in MPD: Ritual Abuse\" [7]. His critics now refer to it as \"The Greenbaum Speech.\" Hammond states:\n\nI've treated and been involved with cases who are part of this original mind-control project as well as having their programming on military reservations in many cases. We find a lot of connections with the CIA.\n\nMy best guess is that the purpose of it is that they want an army of Manchurian Candidates, tens of thousands of mental robots who will do prostitution, do child pornography, smuggle drugs, engage in international arms smuggling, do snuff films, all sorts of very lucrative things and do their bidding and eventually the megalomaniacs at the top believe they'll create a Satanic Order that will rule the world.\"[8]\n\nThese and other assertions and observations made in the speech show that Corydon Hammond agrees with O'Brien's contention that governmental mind control programs continue to function. Critics of recovered memories such as the False Memory Syndrome Foundation are quick to add that recovered memories are not accepted without question by mental health professionals. O'Brien has stated that her knowledge of her purported abuse was gained at least partially through accessing recovered memories.[6]\n\nWithin the subculture of conspiracy believers, O'Brien has her critics. Writing in his book, Cyberculture Counterconspiracy: A Steamshovel Web Reader, author Kenn Thomas states that conspiracy author Martin Cannon considers both O'Brien and Phillips to be \"frauds\" who are using real details of Project Monarch to \"embellish a dog and pony show\", presumably for financial gain.[1]Mattias Gardell notes that O'Brien's claims are almost entirely unsupported by any evidence outside her testimony or the similarly unverified testimony of others.[9]"
