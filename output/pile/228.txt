I want to add more vertical space between my xticlabels and x axis. \nI have tried to set the x bar with \nset xtics offset 0,graph 0.05\n\nmy gnuplot output:\n\nThe data and gnuplot script still same with my previous question here.\n\nA:\n\nYou can do the following:\nFirst add a little bit of bmargin by \nset bmargin 3\n\nSince you need to add vertical space between your xticlabels and x-axis, you need to adjust the Y-offset, which can be done by the following\nset xtics offset 0,-1,0\n\nYou can play around with the values to suite your need.\n\n"
