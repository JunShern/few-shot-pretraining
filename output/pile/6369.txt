This paper is also an update of our previous papers [@Jang:2017ieg; @Bailey:2015tba; @Bailey:2015frw].\n\nInput parameters: $\\Vcb$ and $\\xi_0$ {#sec:Vcb}\n====================================\n\nIn Table \\[tab:Vcb\\], we present updated results for both exclusive $\\Vcb$ and inclusive $\\Vcb$. Recently, HFLAV reported them in Ref.\u00a0[@Amhis:2016xyh]. The results for exclusive $\\Vcb$ are obtained using lattice QCD results for the semileptonic form factors of Refs. [@Bailey2014:PhysRevD.89.114504; @Lattice:2015rga; @Detmold:2015aaa]. Here, we use the combined results (ex-combined) for exclusive $\\Vcb$ and the results of the $1S$ scheme for inclusive $\\Vcb$ to evaluate $\\epsK$. For more details on $\\Vcb$ and the related caveats, refer to Ref.\u00a0[@Bailey:2018feb].\n\nThe absorptive part of long distance effects on $\\epsK$ is parametrized into $\\xi_0$. $$\\begin{aligned}\n  \\xi_0  &= \\frac{\\Im A_0}{\\Re A_0}, \\qquad\n  \\xi_2 = \\frac{\\Im A_2}{\\Re A_2}, \\qquad\n  \\Re \\left(\\frac{\\eps'}{\\eps} \\right) =\n  \\frac{\\omega}{\\sqrt{2} |\\eps_K|} (\\xi_2 - \\xi_0) \\,.\n  \\label{eq:e'/e:xi0}\\end{aligned}$$ There are two independent methods to determine $\\xi_0$ in lattice QCD: one is the indirect method and the other is the direct method. In the indirect method, one can determine $\\xi_0$ using Eq.\u00a0 with lattice QCD input $\\xi_2$ and with experimental results for $\\eps'/\\eps$, $\\epsK$, and $\\omega$. In the direct method, one can determine $\\xi_0$ directly using lattice QCD results for $\\Im A_0$ combined with experimental results for $\\Re A_0$. In Table \\[tab:xi0+d0\\](), we summarize results for $\\xi_0$ calculated by RBC-UKQCD using the indirect and direct methods. Here, we use the results of the indirect method for $\\xi_0$ to evaluate $\\epsK$.\n\nIn Ref.\u00a0[@Bai:2015nea], RBC-UKQCD also reported the S-wave scattering phase shift for the $I=0$ channel: $\\delta_0 =\n23.8(49)(12)$, which is different from those of the dispersion relations [@Colangelo:2001df; @GarciaMartin:2011cn] by $\\approx 3\n\\sigma$. In Ref.\u00a0[@Wang:2018Latt], they have accumulated higher statistics to obtain $\\delta_0 = 19.1(25)(12)$, which is about $5\\sigma$ different from those of the dispersion analyses. They introduce a $\\sigma$ operator and make all possible combinations with the $\\sigma$ and $\\pi-\\pi$ operators. Then, RBC-UKQCD has obtained $\\delta_0 = 32.8(12)(30)$ which is consistent with those of the dispersion relations. These results are presented in Table \\[tab:xi0+d0\\]() and Figure \\[tab:xi0+d0\\]().\n\nInput parameters: Wolfenstein parameters, $\\BK$, $\\xi_\\text{LD}$, and others\n============================================================================\n\nIn Table \\[tab:input-WP-eta\\](), we summarize the Wolfenstein parameters on the market. The CKMfitter and UTfit collaboration provide the Wolfenstein parameters determined by the global unitarity triangle (UT) fit. Unfortunately, $\\epsK$, $\\BK$, and $\\Vcb$ are used as inputs to the global UT fit, which leads to unwanted correlation with $\\epsK$. We want to avoid this correlation, and so take another input set from the angle-only fit (AOF) suggested in Ref.\u00a0[@Bevan2013:npps241.89]. The AOF does not use $\\epsK$, $\\BK$, and $\\Vcb$ as input to determine the UT apex $(\\bar{\\rho}, \\bar{\\eta})$. Here the $\\lambda$ parameter is determined from $\\Vus$ which is obtained from the $K_{\\ell 2}$ and $K_{\\ell 3}$ decays using lattice QCD results for the form factors and decay constants. The $A$ parameter is determined from $\\Vcb$.\n\nIn the FLAG review [@Aoki:2016frl], they present lattice QCD results for $\\BK$ with $N_f=2$, $N_f=2+1$, and $N_f= 2+1+1$. Here, we use the results for $\\BK$ with $N_f=2+1$, which is obtained by taking a global average over the four data points from BMW 11 [@Durr:2011ap], Laiho 11 [@Laiho:2011np], RBC-UKQCD 14 [@Blum:2014tka], and SWME 15 [@Jang:2015sla]. In Table \\[tab:input-BK-other\\](), we present the FLAG 17 result for $\\BK$ with $N_f = 2+1$, which is used to evaluate $\\epsK$.\n\nThe dispersive long distance (LD) effect is defined as $$\\begin{aligned}\n  \\xi_\\text{LD} &=  \\frac{m^\\prime_\\text{LD}}{\\sqrt{2} \\Delta M_K} \\,,\n  \\qquad\n  m^\\prime_\\text{LD}\n  = -\\Im \\left[ \\mathcal{P}\\sum_{C}\n    \\frac{\\mate{\\wbar{K}^0}{H_\\text{w}}{C} \\mate{C}{H_\\text{w}}{K^0}}\n         {m_{K^0}-E_{C}}  \\right]\n  \\label{eq:xi-LD}\\end{aligned}$$ If the CPT invariance is well respected, the overall contribution of the $\\xi_\\text{LD}$ to $\\epsK$ is about $\\pm 2\\%$.\n\nLattice QCD tools to calculate $\\xi_\\text{LD}$ are well established in Refs.\u00a0[@Christ2012:PhysRevD.88.014508; @Bai:2014cva; @Christ:2015pwa]. In addition, there have been a number of attempts to calculate $\\xi_\\text{LD}$ on the lattice [@Christ:2015phf; @Bai:2016gzv]. In them, RBC-UKQCD used a pion mass of 329 MeV and a kaon mass of 591 MeV, and so the energy of the 2 pion and 3 pion states are heavier than the kaon mass. Hence, the sign of the denominator in Eq.\u00a0\\[eq:xi-LD\\] is opposite to that of the physical contribution. Therefore, this work belongs to the category of exploratory study rather than to that of precision measurement.\n\nIn Ref.\u00a0[@Buras2010:PhysLettB.688.309], they use chiral perturbation theory to estimate the size of $\\xi_\\text{LD}$ and claim that $$\\begin{aligned}\n  \\xi_\\text{LD} &= -0.4(3) \\times \\frac{\\xi_0}{ \\sqrt{2} }\n  \\label{eq:xiLD:bgi}\\end{aligned}$$ where we use the indirect results for $\\xi_0$ and its error. Here, we call this method the BGI estimate for $\\xi_\\text{LD}$. In Refs.\u00a0[@Christ2012:PhysRevD.88.014508; @Christ:2014qwa], RBC-UKQCD provides another estimate for $\\xi_\\text{LD}$: $$\\begin{aligned}\n  \\xi_\\text{LD} &= (0 \\pm 1.6)\\%.\n  \\label{eq:xiLD:rbc}\\end{aligned}$$ Here, we call this method the RBC-UKQCD estimate for $\\xi_\\text{LD}$.\n\nIn Table \\[tab:input-WP-eta\\](), we present higher order QCD corrections: $\\eta_{ij}$ with $i,j = t,c$. In Table \\[tab:input-BK-other\\](), we present other input parameters needed to evaluate $\\epsK$. Since Lattice 2017, three parameters: $m_t(m_t)$, $m_{K^{0}}$, $F_K$ have been updated. The $m_t(m_t)$ parameter is the scale-invariant (SI) top quark mass renormalized in the $\\MSb$ scheme. The pole mass of top quarks comes from Ref.\u00a0[@Patrignani:2016xqp]: $  M_t = 173.5 \\pm 1.1 \\GeV$. We convert the top quark pole mass into the SI top quark mass using the four-loop perturbation formula. For more details, refer to Ref.\u00a0[@Bailey:2018feb].\n\nResults for $\\epsK$\n===================\n\nIn Fig.\u00a0\\[fig:epsK:cmp:rbc\\], we present results for $|\\epsK|$ evaluated directly from the standard model (SM) with lattice QCD inputs given in the previous sections. In Fig.\u00a0\\[fig:epsK:cmp:rbc\\](), the blue curve represents the theoretical evaluation of $|\\epsK|$ using the FLAG-2017 $\\BK$, AOF for Wolfenstein parameters, and exclusive $\\Vcb$, and the RBC-UKQCD estimate for $\\xi_\\text{LD}$. The red curve in Fig.\u00a0\\[fig:epsK:cmp:rbc\\] represents the experimental value of $|\\epsK|$. In Fig.\u00a0\\[fig:epsK:cmp:rbc\\](), the blue curve represents the same as in Fig.\u00a0\\[fig:epsK:cmp:rbc\\]() except for using the inclusive $\\Vcb$.\n\nOur results for $|\\epsK|$ are summarized in Table \\[tab:epsK\\]. Here, the superscript ${}^\\text{SM}$ means that it is obtained directly from the standard model, the subscript ${}_\\text{excl}$ (${}_\\text{incl}$) means that it is obtained using exclusive (inclusive) $\\Vcb$, and the superscript ${}^\\text{Exp}$ represents the experimental value. Results in Table \\[tab:epsK\\]() are obtained using the RBC-UKQCD estimate for $\\xi_\\text{LD}$ and those in Table \\[tab:epsK\\]() are obtained using the BGI estimate for $\\xi_\\text{LD}$. In Table \\[tab:epsK\\](), we find that the theoretical evaluation of $|\\epsK|$ with lattice QCD inputs (with exclusive $\\Vcb$) $|\\epsK|^\\text{SM}_\\text{excl}$ has $4.2\\sigma$ tension with the experimental result $|\\epsK|^\\text{Exp}$, while there is no tension with inclusive $\\Vcb$ (heavy quark expansion with QCD sum rules).\n\nIn Fig.\u00a0\\[fig:depsK:sum:rbc:his\\](), we plot the $\\Delta \\epsK \\equiv |\\epsK|^\\text{Exp} -\n|\\epsK|^\\text{SM}_\\text{excl}$ in units of $\\sigma$ (the total error) as a function of time starting from 2012. In 2012, $\\Delta \\epsK$ was $2.5\\sigma$, but now it is $4.2\\sigma$. In Fig.\u00a0\\[fig:depsK:sum:rbc:his\\](), we plot the history of the average $\\Delta \\epsK$ and the error $\\sigma_{\\Delta \\epsK}$. We find that the average has increased with some fluctuations by 27% during the period of 2012-2018, and its error has decreased monotonically by 25% in the same period.\n\nIn Table \\[tab:err-bud+his-DepsK\\](), we present the error budget for $|\\epsK|^\\text{SM}_\\text{excl}$. Here, we find that the largest error comes from $\\Vcb$. Hence, it is essential to reduce the error in $\\Vcb$ significantly.\n\nIn Table \\[tab:err-bud+his-DepsK\\](), we present how the values of $\\Delta\\epsK$ have changed from 2015 [@Bailey:2015tba] to 2018 [@Bailey:2018feb]. Here, we find that the positive shift of $\\Delta \\epsK$ is about the same for the inclusive and exclusive $\\Vcb$. This reflects the changes in other parameters since 2015.\n\nWe thank Shoji Hashimoto and Takashi Kaneko for helpful discussion on $\\Vcb$.
