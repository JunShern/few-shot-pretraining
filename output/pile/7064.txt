    "text": "22C:21 Computer Science II: Data Structures\n\nThis is the second in the sequence of core undergraduate computer science\ncourses and is required for all computer science majors and minors.\nIt builds on the first course, Computer Science I: Fundamentals (22C:16) and\nand is concerned mainly with the design and implementation of data structures,\nalgorithms for accessing and manipulating data structures,\nand the application and uses of data structures.\nJava is the programming language of choice for this course,\nbut the last programming project will contain pieces that you will have\nto complete in C.\n\n8/13: The first discussion sections will meet on Thursday,\n8/30 in the Computer Lab in 301, MLH.\nSection A01 will meet during 12:30-1:20 pm and Sections A02 and A03 will\nmeet simultaneously during 3:30-4:20 pm.\n\n8/29: To get ready for the first lab meeting (Thursday, 8/30) read\nthe Lab 1 Document and the links therein, make sure you\nhave an account on a CS machine and make sure you have a HawkID and password\nto access ICON. You will use an ICON dropbox for submitting your quiz; here are\ninstructions.\n\n9/11: To get ready for Lab 3 (Thursday, 9/11) read\nthe Lab 3 Document and the links therein,\nread CRS.java (solution to Lab 3 problem), and\nread Lab 3 powerpoint. Download CRS.java into\nan Eclipse project called CRS. Quiz 3 asks you to add some methods to the CRS class.\n\n10/3: Our TA Fang Yang has changed her office hours, so as to be\nable to meet more students. Her new office hours are:\n\nWednesday, 2:00-3:30PM\nThursday, 10:00-11:30AM\n\n10/6: There is no Homework 6. This should give you more time to\nfocus on Project 1."
