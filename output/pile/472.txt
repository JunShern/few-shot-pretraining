    "text": "~ Wallace's Attempt at Humanities\n\nCategory Archives: EDUCATION MATTERS\n\n\u201cNo border, no wall, no USA at all\u201d\u2026.Colleges and Universities are adjusting their academic campuses to seemingly hate machines.\n\nMany think our American community is now separated beyond repair. The political party\u2019s hold disdain and malice for each other. Additionally, television journalism, printed media journalist, who used to fight fake or miss-guided news, now simply pretends it doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nGraduating from college in 1960, national politics was deeply divided, yet there was the nonideological party system used as the route to a peculiarly American kind of consensus politics. It seemed to work.\n\nClinton Rossiter, then a Cornell historian, referenced this in his Parties and Politicsin America: \u201cthe parties have been the peacemakers of the American community\u2026the unwitting but forceful suppressors of the \u2018civil-war potential\u2019 we carry always in the bowels of our diverse nation. Blessed are the peace makers, I am tempted to conclude.\u201d\n\nTelevision was certainly around, without color, but we did not suffer an electronic media bent on celebrating daily false news, creating crisis hourly.\n\nRecently, FNC (Fox News Channel) had a median viewer age of 68, compared to MSNBC\u2019s of 63, and CNN\u2019s 59. Changing demographics always rule \u2013 demanding obvious shifts. Joe Concha, The Hill\u2019s trustworthy journalist, writes on media, consistently expressing disenchantment on how the cable propaganda seems never-ending. Their professional obligations to the American public for fact based reporting borders on empty. For me, it border on repulsive.\n\n\u201cCatch me on #Kimmel TONIGHT @JimmyKimmelLive@JimmyKimmel#ABC\u201d, Bret Baier excitedly tweets. How absolutely sad! If one network attempts a balanced, yet controversial news report, their competitors morph into Chesapeake crabs. You know: the crab who manages to climb out of the basket causes other crabs to pull him back down. That\u2019s what crabs do. It is also what cable news networks do. To the sophisticated news view, it becomes a repulsive dynamic.\n\nAll three networks had their strategies: Fox came available in the late 1990\u2019s as a needed conservative antidote \u2013 simply offering a choice, and keeping the others honest. CNN came to Richmond in 1980 symbolizing balanced coverage. MSNBC appeared in an almost schizophrenic state where there was little consistency \u2013 just flopping around from ideology to ideology.\n\nToday\u2019s treacherous business is simply blocking reports that are unsuitable for the ideology of said cable channel: the Rep. Keith Ellison (house member and vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee) alleged relationship abuse charges; Antifa\u2019 s physical attack on a NBC reporter, and camera man \u2013 then unreported by NBC News; the heart-breaking return of human remains from North Korea as a result of the Trump \u2013 North Korea agreement \u2013totally unreported except for FNC; non coverage of FISA court applications; even Trump\u2019s positive economic accomplishments. Conclusion the news seems \u201cfixed\u2019.\n\nFNC (Fox News) finds its brand unsettling. Dropping talents like fly\u2019s for the last several years \u2013 some no doubt for behavior transgressions \u2013 does not denote stability. Others suspect the network\u2019s repositioning to an ideological center-left, which will join the others. FoxNews Sunday has been particularly provoking. Once commandeered by the wonderful Tony Snow \u2013 then Brit Hume, FNC finds itself in the lap of snarly, interruptive, Chris Wallace \u2013 the balance disappears.\n\nYes, Fox & Friends IS averaging 1/5 million against the unwatchable Joe Scarborough. Unbelievably, Juan Williams shows up a half dozen times daily \u2013 one would think his jaded history at the Washington Post would have kept him off the set entirely. Google it if you must.\n\nCNN\u2019s current status is hard, sad, bewildering to its veteran viewers. The once-crown jewel of Cable News Network does not even get the ratings of HGTV. CNN reporter, Jim Acosta, with his recent melt downs at both the Trump rally in Florida, and his remarkable bad behavior at the White House brings disgust. This network is saturated Hate Trump 24 hours daily.\n\nThis was the network of the wonderful Kathleen Sullivan; John Holliman, Bernard Shaw, and Peter Arnett, who transmitted for CNN from a Baghdad hotel as the first bombs dropped in Operation Desert Storm, Jan. 20, 1991. Alas, the network of Robert Novak, Nick Charles, Stuart Varney, Sharyl Attkisson, Mona Charen\u2026..what happened?\n\nMSNBC has long been the problem child and dumping ground for NBC News demotions. For example, once near- greats like Willie Geist, Chris Jansing, Chris Matthews (can one believe Matthews use to sub for Rush Limbaugh?); Brian Williams, Joe Scarborough, and Mika; Joy Ann Reid, who seems apologetic on a monthly basis for some earlier writings\u2026..and a seemingly successful Rachael Maddow.\n\nSaturday, August 12, 2017, delivers deep sadness. Once one experiences life in Charlottesville, the place takes up a special place in one\u2019s education and life. I find her recent defilement unacceptable. Professor Larry Sabato has tweeted the University of Virginia is closed.\n\nAttending the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences there \u2013 living on the corner of Madison and University Ave, diagonally across from the majestic Rotunda \u2013 was truly idyllic. Sitting in a classroom under Dr. Merrill D. Peterson (The Jeffersonian Image in the American Mind) was no minor academic challenge. Still, The anger on last weekend\u2019s tragedy remains inconsolable.\n\nThis charming university town is where young people come to learn, develop, grow-up, and become whole. Now, its tradition and purpose has been violated \u2013 thanks to ignorant \u201cracist goons\u201d on both sides (wacko alt-rightist and Black Lives Matter). These unhinged, ugly outsiders purposefully traveled there to bring civil unrest.\n\nWith all due respect to the easy surface issues, honest diligence requires deeper consideration. Some leadership there perpetuated growing conflict by giving way to the obscenity of political correctness over the R.E. Lee statue, easily ignoring solid civil rights history.\n\nIt was their Democratic party, who, by and large, maintained white supremacy, severe segregation in the first half of Virginia\u2019s 20th century \u2013 not the Republicans. Virginians, under Republican Ted Dalton, Radford, Va. made certain it was unacceptable back in 1953. We should never forget that Republicans in Congress salvaged the Civil Rights legislation for the then Democratic president, Lyndon B. Johnson. Where have the editorialists been on that subject?\n\nMaybe it is time for Charlottesville\u2019s leadership and others go back and crack a few solid history books. There is a lot more to all this.\n\nThen there is the local political leadership. With apparent University support \u2013 taking over Charlottesville\u2019s political structure, with a group of self-assured, self-centered politicians bringing mockery and depriving Mr. Jefferson\u2019s village of balanced government. By advocating a poisonous political correctness; they engineered a new definition of simple subversion. Realizing or not, this leadership dismissed the traditional culture of community.\n\nMayor Michael Signer, oozing with condescension and total self-righteousness, exhibited himself for our entire nation to view, evaluate. Signer came to Charlottesville political service from the UVA classroom. Appearing first with Governor McAuliffe in a press conference, then on the ever-inviting CNN, Signer displayed an insufferable moral preening \u2013 playing a totally adopted heroic role vs. the irredeemable, with whom he is surrounded. One\u2019s reaction: nothing more than UGH \u2013 stick-finger-down-the-throat time.\n\nAdditionally, the mayor went so far as to blame the president after Trump\u2019s very clear, solid statement about \u201call sides responsible\u201d. It wasn\u2019t good enough for him, nor the mainstream media. Surprise! No question we can count on Signer to be one of the Republican/Trump-hating extremist. Irony upon all ironies \u2013 David Duke stands with Michael Signer in their criticism of President Trump. These two stoke the \u201coutrage machine\u201d hand-in-hand.\n\nThe deaths of Charlottesville native, Heather Heyer, a young paralegal from Greene County, and the Virginia State Policemen: Trooper-Pilot Berke M.M. Bates, Quinton, Va.; Lt. H. Jay Cullen, Midlothian, Va., was nothing short of obscene, and one must ask \u2013 for what?\n\nNow, Emancipation Park will carry its own history as a place where terrorism prevailed despite all the lofty intentions. The Richmond Times Dispatch clearly reported that both sides were militarized in some fashion. They both arrived to war \u2013alt. rights vs. counter protesters.\n\nI cannot help but envision Robert E. Lee saddled up , looking down at the mob below\u2026.quietly saying: hey, I\u2019ll leave quietlyso you can pursue your lives. He would be heartbroken \u2013 simply riding away to separate himself from the academic riff raff.\n\nAs a Richmonder, it is required to end with a cautionary note: our Mayor Levar Stoney had better look out for his \u201cfire bell in the night.\u201d It is headed in his direction\u2026the recent meeting at the Virginia Historical Society was ever so propitious.\n\nCharlottesville, mon amour \u2013 you deserved so much better from all sides \u2013 from all of us.\n\nDr. Lewis H. Drew, retired Dean of Students \u2013 Hampden-Sydney College (H-SC), wrote a little book in 2016: Thoughts on the Inherent Connection among Education, Character Development, Leadership and the Formation of Good People.\n\nEarlier, German philosopher, George Wilhelm Hegel, wrote: Education is \u201cthe art of making man ethical.\u201d If he was correct in the 19th century, would he be correct today? For me the above citations act as simple grace \u2013 in other words\u2026.don\u2019t allow the culture rob you of your soul \u2013 with hand-picked moral equivalencies. To be any kind of educator, one must stand one\u2019s ground.\n\nYale professor allows student to skip exams due to shock over presidential-election results, November 9, 2016.\n\nHere in Richmond, VA, we see Virginia Commonwealth University students abandoning their studies\u2026to protest the 2016 Presidential election results \u2013 dismissing their academic, learning responsibilities \u2013 and attempting to massively block I\u201395\u2026.a nearby interstate through the city.\n\nA testimony: \u201cWhen I moved into my office at Darden a woman came around and asked me if I would place a \u2018Safe Place\u2019 hanging sign on the door-handle outside my office. \u2018Why?\u2019 I inquired. It tells students that if they\u2019re feeling threatened they can find safety in your office, was the reply. \u2018I don\u2019t think I\u2019m in a position to offer blanket sanctuary for everyone on campus,\u2019 I replied. Especially, people I don\u2019t know, or have never met. The woman walked away in a huff. I never saw her again\u201d.\n\nAnd this\u2026they KANT be serious! PC students demand white philosophers including Plato and Descartes be dropped from the University of London syllabus. Such seminal figures including Bertrand Russell should be largely dropped from the curriculum simply because they are white. The School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS)\u2026demanded that examples should be from Africa and Asia.\n\nOther headlines: Wayne State University cuts Math \u2013 wants \u201cDiversity\u201d Requirements for General Education Curriculum\u2026..The University of Wisconsin-Madison is now requiring all men to take gender identity class to \u201cmake sure\u201d they are really men\u2026\u2026George Washington University, a 25,000-student private university, located in Foggy Bottom neighborhood of Washington, D.C. \u2013 eliminated its American-history requirement for undergraduate history majors \u2013 making it theoretically possible to graduate from GW with a history degree without ever having had to take a college-level course in U.S. history\u2026.\n\nOften an ill-defined integrity means staying with the ship, no matter what, even if it was veering in unscheduled directions that bring disaster of all its loyal passengers. Loyalty to a cause can be impressively touching \u2013 like deep friendship \u2013 but oh, so perverse \u2013 as the above items illuminate.\n\nSo what about the enshrined status of Hampden-Sydney College (\u201cSydney\u201d) after her recent years of reported clumsy leadership struggle? Alumni keep up \u2013 occasionally bombarded by the college\u2019s despair with the Longwood University squabble; the apparent old nemesis \u2013 drugs and Honor Code violations (joining many Universities and Colleges) among some of her students. In years past, aberrant behaviors are addressed with strong Honor Code discipline, ridding the campus of those who attempted reward by dishonest means; we\u2019ve learned to eschew such academic miseries.\n\nH-SC, nationally ranked, is lead by energetic John Lawrence Stimpert, her 25th president; and M. Peebles Harrison, new Board chairman. Working together, they have geared up for a professional examination, focusing on both Board governance, and Admissions\u2026with a deep degree of seriousness.\n\nRemembering a challenging memorandum written by former H-SC board member, Bill Crutchfield, a good start is to address the decision to remain with single gender education. If the college is to remain single gender, it should aggressively leverage that unique differentiator. First steps need to be clear articulation of how a single-gender education truly benefits a specific sub-set of young men.\n\nDeveloping a very powerful case for all-male education easily communicated to laypersons, such as potential students and their parents, is paramount. As Crutchfield explained in 2013, On the other hand, if the college cannot develop a strong case for single-gender education that can be communicated to lay persons, we should seriously consider becoming coeducational.\n\nDean Drew\u2019s little book inspires. He quotes H-SC\u2019s Walter Blair Professor of Latin, the late Dr. Graves H. Thompson: the four years a man spends at college should be like a hill in a plain. As he ascends the hill, he is able more and more to see back over the road that humanity has trod \u2013 the great things that have been thought, and said, and done, and believed, and created.\n\nWoody Allen said that 80% of celebrity is showing up; Saying and doing the courageous thing makes it 100%. Both Stimpert and Harrison seem to get that.\n\nWhile the plural form of \u201cmedium\u201d is \u201cmedia\u201d, the term has regrettably become more than a regular noun. Instead, it has morphed into a dreaded anathema for serious news consumers, academicians; they\u2019re use to absorbing information in earnest \u2013 both right and left.\n\nOstensibly, \u201cmedia\u201d stood for the main means of accurate mass communication (especially television, radio, newspapers, and the Internet); collectively, it was regarded as positive. Historically, readers anticipated reliability, truth, and its fundamental role as the Fourth Estate. Now, many see it as vastly untrustworthy, agenda oriented, deceiving \u2013 finally, a sad hoot.\n\nGrowing up in the 1940\u2019s, radio became a trustworthy source for media news. It was clearly reported in the TheMurrow Boys, a group of CBS broadcast journalists, writers\u2026.closely associated with Edward R. Murrow, during and after World War II \u2013 into the fifties.\n\nHighly respected were William L. Shirer (The Rise & Fall of the Third Reich); Charles (Bonnie Prince) Collingwood; the beautiful laconic- like voice of Winston Burdett, in Rome; and the challenging Howard K. Smith. State-side if you wanted a leftist broadcaster: Elmer Davis, Edward P. Morgan, Robert Trout, and Eric Sevareid were reliable. For the conservatives: Fulton Lewis, Jr.; Morgan Beatty, Westbrook Pegler, George Sokolsky, and Gabriel Heater. Lewis\u2019 influence was huge \u2013 right into the sixties. WLEE\u2019s Harvey Hudson brought Fulton Lewis, Jr. to the Westwood Club on numerous occasions. Finally, for news amusement: Drew Pearson and Walter Winchell.\n\nNow \u201cmedia\u201d thrives with writers, columnists, recovering lawyers, political specialists\u2026. those degreed from left wing journalism schools \u2013 immersing themselves as singularly redemptive for a troubled America. Their reporting reflects what images they determine should be promoted \u2013 nailing the imperfect, broken America they view \u2013 naturally inherited from racists, less talented generations.\n\nOh, did I mention, they write from a perspective that carries condescension, well-put contempt, directed to those who view issues differently \u2013 always uniformly dismissed. For those who live in Realville, this contemporary journalistic group can be unrelenting in their elitism \u2013 reveling disdainfully our current political system. My reaction: it reminds one of trying to teach fishes of the sea\u2026.about fire.\n\nDo media reflect a high support for current leftist causes: big government; abortion on demand; politically correct victimology; massive debt; a foreign policy (leading from behind); reverse racism; energized sympathy for the Democrat over Republican? As Sen. Marco Rubio said, \u201cThe Democrats have the ultimate super PAC \u2013 it\u2019s called mainstream media.\u201d\n\nFurther inquiry escalates: are these ideological views promoted by a designed media conspiracy \u2013 planned by a diabolic group of extreme leftist? I\u2019m taking a \u201chall pass\u201d on that one \u2013 here\u2019s why.\n\nPeeved, as this writer remains, we are provided with a latch key into some reasons provided in Left Turn: How Liberal Media Bias Distorts the American Mind, by Tim Groseclose\u2026which does entice.\n\nKelly Riddell of the Washington Times cited this a half year ago. \u201cThere\u2019s something in the DNA of liberals that makes them want to go into jobs like the arts, journalism, and academia more so than conservatives.\u201d Groseclose concludes: \u201cEven if you\u2019re just trying to maximize profits by offering an alternative point of view, it\u2019s hard to find conservative reporters\u201d, particularly those debuting from journalism schools.\n\nSo it\u2019s natural the media is more liberal. For profits sake, Dr. David D\u2019Alessio, communications science professor at the University of Connecticut at Stamford, admits to press bias. He goes on to explain it is best for business to even it out \u2013 to the middle \u2013 because that\u2019s where the greatest market is for making money.\n\nD\u2019Alessio continues: \u2026their job is about making money. \u201cIf you look at where people\u2019s opinions are, they are in the middle, so that\u2019s where reporting should go because that\u2019s where the eyeballs go.\u201d The cultural choice of presentation is another subject entirely. Front pages which use to aspire to Herald Tribune quality\u2026now seem to choose the allure of Police Gazette \u2013purposefully.\n\nSadly, trust in the news media is being eroded by perceptions of bias. Just 6 percent of people say they have a lot of confidence in the media \u2013 putting the news industry about equal to Congress \u2013 and well below the public\u2019s view of other institutions. The American public wants news that is up to date, accurate, concise, and clearly honest. They know that they are not getting it.\n\nHOFFMAN\u2026Dropping in again on William Hoffman, author, is an inspirational struggle, probably soulful in nature. Men in Trees and Men on the Water, wrote Maria Spalding Hadlow in her master\u2019s thesis at James Madison University.\n\nThe lure of Trees (mountains) \u2013 the Water (rivers and bay) became the invitation for Hoffman\u2019s\u2019 carefully constructed literature. It is striking how Hadlow\u2019s scholarship harks back to friend, Don Gehring\u2019s observation: \u201cThere\u2019s a whole bunch of us \u2026.in us.\u201d\n\nHenry William Hoffman, born in Charleston, West Virginia, went to Charleston public schools. Serving in World War II (both Normandy and the Battle of the Bulge), he returned home on a hospital ship. Enrolling at Hampden-Sydney College, he received his degree in 1949; Hoffman would spend a post-graduate year at Washington & Lee University with Tom Wolf. His honorary doctorate there followed later.\nHoffman\u2019s character-development included deprivation of place \u2013 grasping justifications \u2013 unexpected virtues of simple resilience \u2013 desperately searching for an elusive integrity.\n\nAs a 1950\u2019s Hampden-Sydney College student, I witnessed the \u201cearly Hoffman\u201d in that special place \u2013 cool, understated, wise-for-his-time, war-scarred young novelist, journeying to where his creativity would beach. We shared our membership installation to O D K Honorary Fraternity.\n\nIn our retirement move to Westham Green condos, I carefully examined our new book shelves; the novels were lined up chronologically \u2013 13 novels, four books of short stories. Recalling his awards: 1992 John Dos Passos Prize For Literature; O. Henry Prize, 1996; the Dashiell Hammett Award for his Tidewater Blood (1998), brought rekindled admiration.\n\nStudents affectionately called him \u201cshaky\u201d with his occasional World War II shell- shock spasms. All took deep pride in having a novelist-in-residence. His stories reminded us that there\u2019s a little bit of ostrich in all of us \u2013 never to abate.\n\nDaniel M. Hawks, Assistant Curator for Jamestown-Yorktown Foundation, recalled his Hoffman Creative Writing Class: one morning each student in the class was required to read the opening paragraph of the \u201cpiece\u201d he had been assigned to write. One of the men near the front of the class (whose name I cannot remember) began by saying, \u201cThe air was filled with excitement\u201d. Hoffman immediately jumped out of his chair pointed his arms into the air as if he had a hunting rifle and yelled \u201cBang, bang, bang! I just killed excitement!\u201d\n\nMuch later a wonderful reunion of two old friends, Tom Wolf and William Hoffman, at Washington & Lee University, was recorded. They discussed a year in Virginia letters \u2013 their year \u2013 in Lexington, now six decades ago.\nTaking creative writing classes, Hoffman and Wolf helped launch W & L\u2019s prestigious literary magazine: Shenandoah. Fascinating exchanges between these old friends brought published intricate insights. Each of them remembered the title, plot, even character names of the first story the other published.\n\nTom Wolf observed that fictional characters had their ways. \u201cI think clothes often are a give-away of who a person thinks they are\u2026a kind of a little window that opens.\u201d Hoffman laughingly agreed.\nRichmonder, Elizabeth Seydel Morgan, publisher of poetry, directed this awareness to Hoffman readers. \u201cThere they were, two Virginia gentlemen talking about the writing life, double-breasted suits, and their halcyon days at Washington & Lee.\u201d\n\nMaria Hadlow\u2019s concluding interview brought Hoffman\u2019s assorted thoughts together: \u201cI was brought up as sort of privileged character. My mother and father were poor, so we moved in with my grandmother\u2026.We went to Florida in the winter. I was sent to private schools and summer camps\u2026my father lost his house and business \u2013 everything and his marriage broke up. So I\u2019ve got these two things. I\u2019ve got the side that had the money and the privileges; I\u2019ve got the side that didn\u2019t have anything\u2026.so I see it from both sides\u2026.\u201d\n\nHe wrote from multiple hearts \u2013 multiple places \u2013 innumerable spiritual susceptibilities, with deep agonies of an eternal soul. Robert Merritt once described him as a writer with eye for detail, simplicity of dialogue, allowing us in on not only a South as it was, but also a South as it is. This was evident in my Hoffman favorite: A Place For My Head (1960).\n\nDr. John L. Brinkley, H-SC historian and classics professor, reminded us: Professor Hoffman could be blunt with his students, but the intent was always pure.\n\nMonths ago, at Wesleyan University, \u201cthe student government voted to CUT funding for the 150-year-old campus newspaper after it (courageously) published a conservative op/ed.\u201d This latest campus cultural affliction was reported by Washington Post\u2019s columnist, Catherine Rampell.\n\nSo, let me get this straight, this Wesleyan defunding followed Williams College\u2019s earlier stunning scheme: addressing their atmosphere of free-speech intolerance \u2013 by extracting some concession \u2013 creating an \u201cUncomfortable Learning Speaker Series.\u201d Three cheers\u2026bring out the Tote Bags and stale nabs!\n\nWilliams\u2019 new policy was responding with an antidote to their super-intolerant, fantasizing left-leaning student body. Williams College \u2013 a $63,290.00 tuition annual bargain \u2013 wistfully, but briskly caved by disinviting one of their earliest speaker choices, Suzanne Venker, conservative writer, thinker.\n\nSeemingly, this falls in the vein of Groucho Marx\u2019s Horse Feathers (1932) \u2013 his role as president of brainless Huxley College \u2013 (whatever it is, I\u2019m against it). For me, this prompts back to Tonight\u2019s Jack Paar, and his \u2013 I kid you not.\n\nAll this ideological idiocy brings us to The New Criterion, November issue. Subject: Unfree Speech at university campuses across America. It should frighten all reasonably serious Americans \u2013 left or right \u2013 who\u2019d deem these policies both dangerous and disastrous.\n\nArthur C. Brooks (NYT), in a recent piece, cites a published paper in the Behavioral and Brain Sciences journal, detailing a shocking level of political (left) groupthink in academia. One of its authors, Philip E. Tetlock (University of Pennsylvania), summed it up: in researching \u201cpolitical charged topics form an ideologically incestuous community is downright delusional\u201d. Yeats\u2019 fire remains unlit.\n\nWhat now exists on college and university campuses is a slew of carefully directed grievance cultures, mixed with insistency on acute victimology. One can easily inquire of former Secretary of State Condi Rice; Ayaan Hirsi; Charles Murray; Christine Lagarde, first woman to head the IMF; columnist George Will on what they cumulatively experienced after receiving commencement-speaking invitations \u2013 a disinvite. This perfectly reflects an ingrained hostility to free speech and thought.\n\nThen there is the Michelle Obama example: At five Topeka, Kansas high schools, students learned they could invite six people to the commencement for students from five high schools, which was meant to honor the seniors and the 60th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education. Students petitioned\u2026.asking the school board to change the event. Getting their demands met, the graduations were broken up; Ms. Obama\u2019s speech was moved to an additional venue \u2013 something called \u201cSenior Recognition Day.\u201d\n\nCriterion further reports results from the William F. Buckley Program at Yale. The survey (McLaughlin & Associates) covers 800 students of various colleges.\n\nAlarming is the word: *Students favor their schools having speech codes to regulate both students and faculty\u202651% to 31%; *Require professors to employ \u201ctrigger warnings\u201d for students who may be sensitive to material that might be discomforting; *One third of the students polled could not identify the First Amendment as part of the United States Constitution dealing with free speech; *35% said the First Amendment does not protect \u201chate speech\u201d; *30% of self-identified Liberal Students say the First Amendment is outdated, needing revision or elimination.\n\nUnfortunately, at all cost, solid dissension (opposition) must be devalued \u2013 even eliminated. Current issues such as climate change; abortion; race relations (Black Live Matter); feminism; even sex, are not open for debate.\n\nCheerlessly, campus intellect-pursuit has fallen from a rich experience of dining\u2026.to simply eating. Meanwhile, it will lead to leftist ideology ruling over serious critical thought \u2013 without anyone realizing the difference. Proper scholarship is based on tolerance, openness and modesty.\n\n\u201cEducation is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of fire.\u201d Soon, there will be days where such snark and contempt will drench campuses \u2013 where process and machinery will rule, smothering critical thought \u2013 without interruption.\n\nOn a positive note, I met Hampden-Sydney College in the 13th grade, totally by blind dumb luck, immediately encountering serious liberal arts challenges.\n\nJohn McCandell, Vice Chancellor of Sewanee, the University of the South, was recently quoted: \u201cThe sense that there is a crisis among small liberal arts colleges for financial reasons doesn\u2019t seem borne out by the evidence.\u201d Continuing: \u201cAll of us are going to have to continue to take a good close look at how we allocate precious financial aid dollars, lest we see serious socio-economic effects.\u201d It\u2019s a good beginning.\n\nAs a red-white-blue-garnet-gray Hampden-Sydney product, I deeply feel \u2013 for the health of our culture, and nation \u2013 smaller liberal arts colleges must not only thrive, but discover ways to accommodate academically deserving students (note the word, deserving), who need financial assistance.\n\nWhile the small liberal arts model seems \u201cthe most expensive model there is,\u201d it can and does function as the jewel of higher education. It simply preserves/protects a solid, refined learning experience.\n\nFor me, \u201cSydney\u201d has been analogous to experiencing a life-long best friend. That\u2019s special\u2026but having this best friend almost your entire life is a rare blessing \u2013 something deeply held. And if that friend\u2019s industry or business model begins to get wobbly, attention must be paid. Internal examination, if required, needs to begin yesterday.\n\nThankfully, it\u2019s unnecessary for me to remind the quintessential professional Anita H. Garland, Dean of Admissions at Hampden-Sydney College that many applicants, who are attracted to the small, nurturing, residential liberal arts environment, are now showing up from different socio-economic backgrounds. Following defining demographic changes in student populations, it\u2019s neither surprising, nor shocking, this day has arrived. The student world is a changin.\n\nChoosing anonymity, a talented H-SC alumnus (in the higher education field), spoke about the \u201cH-SC man\u201d \u2013 as a liberally educated gentleman, well grounded, with his almost spiritual description: \u201cone of servant leadership.\u201d\n\nAs lines between gender-roles thin further, with educated gentlemanliness swamped into perceived anachronism, are those brands proceeding to the cultural dumpster? Answer: no \u2013 despite the crushing heavy-handedness of a growing coarseness in American culture. We simply owe it to western traditions.\n\nShould veteran alumni be part of redefining the enticement of the school? Should the college create a renewed bent on Christian faith \u2013 particularly in the current climate? Promoting the campus location as a safety alternative to urban campus up evil would appeal. Sure, it\u2019s possible an H-SC curriculum could benefit from tweaking. Many even consider including a newly cultivated \u201cHampden-Sydney man\u201d\u2026.and \u2018woman\u2019.\n\nSmall college creativity abounds: Wilson College \u2013 slowly went co-ed, and cut the tuition 17%, launching the nation\u2019s first debt buy-back program; Sewanee adopted a tuition cut of 10%, locking the price in for the entire 4 years; Mary Baldwin College (soon to be University) buffets the core residential liberal arts program by launching health science programs as a separate college, and creating a graduate education program of its own. Baldwin has been creative for years; Hampden-Sydney could consider a non-residential, but authentic off-campus College location on the outskirts of Roanoke, or Richmond \u2013 building a first two year program \u2013 feeding into a completed campus experience\u2026possibly creating classes in cyber security, health management, even political communication.\n\nFinally, for me, it looks like recruiting more and more students who need heavy financial aid is not a good idea. Realizing our current administration desires this, we\u2019d better be \u201cdamn sure\u201d, as Dr. Ned Crawley often roared. Betting most institutions have a clear \u201ctipping point\u201d for its discount rate, one wonders what it is for Hampden-Sydney.\n\nThe economy and culture of America are testing all small private colleges, small universities. Future environments require heavily engaged, talented administrators, in this exacting academic age. Their success, survival, or demise, will result with the pathologies created inside them.\n\nBook it, Danno.\n\nRaymond B. Wallace, Jr. acknowledges UNIVERSITY BUSINESS for some of the material contained herein. Wallace\u2019s new book ESSEX MEMORIES & BEYOND was recently nominated in the non-fiction category for the 18th annual Library of Virginia Literary Award, 2015.\n\nThe much ballyhooed film, SELMA, is taking a hit which could and should have been avoided. The experience of my Advance Placement teaching days make this conclusion easy \u2013 sadly reluctant.\n\nUtilizing an important instrument, in my case teaching A.P. United States History, and accurately assessing the role of a white, politically Democratic president in the 1964 Civil Rights movement, is essential \u2013 particularly for young minorities. These students must have some solid foundation to comprehend this troubled racial world of today.\n\nThe film missed the mark. It strayed and betrayed itself into a reverse racism platform, complying with current minority cultural demands. What a lost opportunity! Only in America: Glen Beck, national radio-talk conservative, and Michael Paul Williams, Richmond Times Dispatch\u2019s predictable leftist columnist, stood hand-in-hand on the matter of SELMA. Both saw it as richly inspiring and a critical must-see \u2013 accompanied by others who believe it a personal spiritual requirement \u2013 to be in love, with loving this film.\n\nFor those of us who were clearly around \u2013 remembering well the black and white TV coverage of Montgomery fire hoses \u2013 a couple years prior to the disaster on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, AL, I am absolutely baffled by the propensity to present spurious history regarding President Lyndon Banes Johnson\u2019s role. Johnson\u2019s pivotal and a supportive action for the protestors was very clear \u2013 backed up by released tapes of these discussions. Sadly, the film\u2019s director chose to bring her audience a depiction both warped, and inaccurate \u2013 in an overtly dishonest presentation.\n\nJoylessly, I find myself in agreement with New York Times columnist, Maureen Dowd\u2019s description of the SELMA\u2019s message as: \u201cartful falsehood.\u201d\n\nMaking it worse, Richmond VA\u2019s leadership sponsored 10,000 Richmond high school students to see Selma, without any apparent teaching-moment follow up; they bought into a blemished version. One would think corporate leadership would know better!\n\nFor both Glen Beck and, Michael Paul Williams, it makes little difference if the film presents bogus history regarding LBJ\u2019s role in the event. Artistic license often purposefully distorts the truth; it clearly does in Selma\u2019s case. The natural and protracted excuse enveloping those of us appalled and saddened with this production, is\u2026.that it\u2019s simply a movie \u2013 and, hey, that\u2019s really OK after all.\n\nIf the presentation was contrived through ignorance (it wasn\u2019t), or distorted with an \u201cemotional history\u201d, triumphanting over truth, the disgrace expands. Sadly this show borders on unforgivable because it was directed to vulnerable minds \u2013 totally bereft of a frame of reference or any comparative background. Because a white President Johnson was portrayed in a version the current minority culture demands, the consideration of truth seems non-existent.\n\nThe heart breaking question rings loudly: what are we doing to ourselves? Americans: African-American and whites, must do better.\n\nI really speculate those 10,000 Richmond middle and high school students, under the local RVA\u2019s sponsorship to free-see the film; will not be taught accurate history about their President \u2013 in 1960\u2019s American history. Their impression will slowly morph into \u201cknowledge\u201d; it will be serving a dreaded and pleasing, growing ignorance and separatism further along racial lines.\n\nHistories tease; the discipline shakes, shifts, taking new forms \u2013 almost as predictably as the Earth\u2019s crust \u2013 with nagging regularity. Embossed announcements, they are not. Deciphering, what should be learned, and in my case, what should\u2019ve been taught in Henrico\u2019s Mills Godwin U.S. History class rooms, becomes a paramount objective. Obduracy has no place.\n\nWhile the RTD editorial analyzed a recently published history \u2013 Edward E. Baptist\u2019s The Half Has Never Been Told \u2013 other books, unabashedly scream for classroom usage: Ross Douthat\u2019s Bad Religion; and James E. Ryan\u2019s Five Miles Away, A World Apart (a Richmond analysis between two high schools \u2013 Douglas Freeman and an urbanized Thomas Jefferson).\n\nAdding to personal challenge is my celebrated membership in that first 1956 graduating class at Douglas Freeman H.S. \u2013 inducing an unwarranted, but inexact discomfort. Now, what to teach.\n\n*Douthat\u2019s Bad Religion measured significant chronology of cultural changes from the Eisenhower years to George W. Bush\u2019s election. It offended almost everyone who is bone-deep with religion. The text criticized an amazing variety of American religious pathologies \u2013 fair, but blunt in analysis. Douthat\u2019s work brings light to the A.P. block: Religion In America. It was a time when Americans began believing in anything by labeling it spiritual. And yes, such spiritual gymnastics affected history.\n\n*Ryan\u2019s Five Miles Away sparked local, social analysis. Using two local high schools as archetypes, examining the cultures of student bodies ( TJ \u2013 82% minority; DSF \u2013 73% white ), the text has a clear theme: central city vs. the suburbs. Ryan labels \u201cNixon compromise\u201d as a new separateness \u2013 the issue of desegregating students was transformed into one of \u201cdesegregating dollars.\u201d The new maxim: \u201curban schools should be helped in ways that do not threaten the physical, financial, or political independence of suburban schools.\u201d Student discourse would jump for the \u201cteaching moment\u201d with that thesis? You bet.\n\n*The Half Has Never Been Told finds the application of Nixonian terminology, \u201cthe big enchilada\u201d, spot on. Its conclusion requires rethinking, reteaching on how wretched Americanized slavery emerged into nationalized status \u2013 with energized complicity of American business.\n\nFor instance: As early as the 1820\u2019s, slave owners commanded the biggest pool of collateral in the United States \u2013 two million slaves worth more than $1 billion. It\u2019s 20% of all the wealth owned by all U.S. citizens \u2013 irrespective of sectional background and culture. From 1824 to 1832, the Philadelphia-based Bank of the United States, the banker of the Federal Government, multiplied the amount of its loans to Mississippi Valley slave owners 16 times over \u2013 a massive investment.\n\nBaptist assures by 1832, at least one-third of the entire bank\u2019s capital had been allocated to planters, slave traders, merchants, and local banks in the \u201cslave frontier\u201d of southwestern states. The depth of the bank\u2019s commitment, in turn, gave EUROPEAN INVESTORS confidence to lavishly inject their own currency in American slaves. Slavery in the American South emerged into a worldwide investment.\n\nDuring the ante-bellum period, lists of participating American corporations intrigued: Lehman Brothers; Aetna, Inc.; JPMorgan Chase; New York Life; Wachovia Corporation (now owned by Wells Fargo); N M Rothschild & Sons Bank in London; Norfolk Southern; USA Today even found that their own parent company, E.W. Scripps and Gannett, has had links to the slave trade.\n\nHistory instructs The Civil War cost America about 640,000 lives; it would finally bring an end to the lucrative partnerships between the cruel machine of Southern slavery and the Northern roaring engines of slave capitalism.\n\nIn the movie, Wall Street (1987), Gordon Gekko fabricated that greed is good\u2026greed is right\u2026greed works\u2026and greed clarifies. It conveyed a contemptuous conclusion, wrecking American humanity for over two centuries, in unfathomable ways. Mr. Might-Have-Been ponders.\n\nRaymond B. Wallace, Jr. recently published his book, ESSEX MEMORIES& BEYOND. He can be contacted: rbwallace01@verizon.net.\n\nNormally, when Henrico teachers, mostly retired by now, consider Dr. William C. Bosher, they simply understand he lacked the bureaucratic odor. He simply avoided the malady\u2026he did not speak nor share inanities of bureaucratic vocabulary. No fabrications in his leadership.\n\nWilliam (Bill) Cleveland Bosher, Jr. was in recent years Distinguished Professor Public Policy and Education at Virginia Commonwealth University. He came through the ranks, starting in Henrico County, VA where he taught and later became superintendent. Making my career change to the classroom in 1984, I was simply fortunate to work under him\u2026.he would later become dean of the VCU School of Education.\n\nMost importantly, he headed off silly far-fetched nationally educational trends, one after another, keeping the system straight and narrow. He would use imagery of English literature, mesmerizing both student and teacher. He could be forcefully blunt: \u201cOBE (Outcome Based Education) in Virginia is dead.\u201d We were so grateful.\n\nAs a middle aged new-comer from the real corporate world, I early understood Dr. Bosher valued and understood his richest asset: the teacher \u2013 how fortunate for us."
