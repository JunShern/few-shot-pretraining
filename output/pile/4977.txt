    "text": "ASKING: $200 shipped\n\nI'm selling my beloved M1060. I ordered these directly from Monoprice last August, and since then they've time and time again survived the headphone gauntlet as I kept buying and trying other headphones. I ended up liking these over the E-MU Teak, the HD650, and the HE4XX, all of which I had bought, tried to love, but ended up deciding that I loved the M1060 more.Mine are modded with the following:At one point last year, I bought and tried the Audeze Vegan pads, but after many weeks of listening, I had to admit to myself that the original pads with my felt mod sounded noticeably better.I stand by that my particular M1060 sounds great. It is a warm, laid back headphone with superb technicalities. My pair has never exhibited ringing; its transient response and instrument separation continue to impress me to this day; and I've yet to hear better bass performance from a headphone or IEM.Condition: superb working condition, cosmetic blemishes due to pad swapping. Also the wood where the hinges are have cracked many months ago (see picture album), but this does not in the slightest affect the use or integrity of the headphones."
