In the case of the trauma designation process, the state turned to the American College of Surgeons to provide verification surveys for all levels of trauma centers. In 2006, concerned with the high cost of ACS survey services, the Texas trauma community \u2013 with strong support from the 22 trauma regional advisory councils (RACs) \u2013 launched the Texas EMS, Trauma and Acute Care Foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. TETAF provides operational support and helps fill the gap when federal, state and local governments and private entities cannot provide services on a statewide basis. TETAF was granted authority by the Texas Department of State Health Services in 2008 to provide verification surveys for Level III and Level IV designated trauma facilities, and in 2009 the first TETAF staff was hired to begin fully implementing TETAF\u2019s mission.\nTETAF has recently released a new document providing information and answering questions about the TETAF survey process to help hospitals and Trauma Program Managers. Click here to access this helpful FAQ document.\n\nPartnering with the Texas Department of State Health Services, TETAF staff provides technical assistance resources in program development as well as coordination of survey services to ensure a successful Stroke Support Facility (Level III) designation process.\n\nPartnering with the Texas Department of State Health Services, TETAF staff provides technical assistance resources in trauma program development as well as coordination of survey services to ensure a successful designation process."
