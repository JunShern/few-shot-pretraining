Had I started the job a year or two earlier, I might have found that covering things like how to be a manager, corporate strategy, risk management, governance, and corporate social responsibility was worthy but possibly sometimes a little dull. Now I found that my beat was everything that had gone terribly wrong and was going to have to go very right to get us all back to prosperity. Since then, I've had the pleasure of publishing some of the world's best minds on every aspect of leadership.\nPreviously I was a senior editor of Forbes magazine, and before that I was for many years the managing editor of American Heritage and the editor of the quarterly Invention & Technology. I've emceed the annual induction ceremony at the National Inventors Hall of Fame, done the play-by-play over the P.A. system on a cruise ship as it passed through the Panama Canal, and written on the history of bourbon whiskey and the making of Steinway pianos, among many, many other things. I prepared for all that by majoring in music in college and writing a senior thesis on the music of Hector Berlioz.\nFollow me on Twitter here.\n\nNames You Need to Know in 2011: FiveFingers\n\nHere\u2019s something you need to know about: Could we be seeing the beginning of the end of the modern running shoe? A growing legion of runners and recreational joggers\u2014I am one\u2014backed by a rising number of physiologists, believe that running shoes do more harm than good for millions of people. With their inflexibility, cushioning, and raised heels, they almost force you to crash down on your heel and send the impact of all your weight in every step straight into your knees and hips. That\u2019s not how our bodies were designed to work, and it does terrible harm. (This post is part of an ongoing effort to crowd-source a repeating feature in Forbes magazine entitled Names You Need to Know. We are looking for the people, places, products and ideas that will have significant impact in the near future. Join the ongoing conversation here. )\n\nMillions of years of evolution gave us a much springier way of running, which begins with our coming down on the front of our foot, a little like when you run in place. You necessarily run that way when you run barefoot, because hitting with your heel would be unbearably painful. But who is going to run barefoot in the modern world?\n\nEnter FiveFingers, a line of shoes by the Italian company Vibram that are really gloves for the feet, with minimal protection and a finger for each toe. They look like the feet part of a gorilla costume, and they feel almost like being barefoot. They have grown a cult of devotees over the past few years, and they\u2019re starting to go mainstream. You see them on more and more runners, and the stores that sell them can\u2019t keep them in stock. The running shoe industry has begun trying to figure out how to either beat them or join them, and they and other new minimalist shoes are the subject of a long article in the November 2010 issue of Runner\u2019s World.\n\nI\u2019m a believer. I became one after seeing the wacky-looking things on someone, asking about them, learning more online, and deciding to spend the $85 to try out a pair of FiveFingers KSOs (a model that covers the top of the foot and \u201cKeeps Stuff Out\u201d). I feel freer, faster, lighter on my feet, and my knees and hips don\u2019t hurt anywhere near the way they used to. Pronation and plantar fascitis seem to disappear when you start using your feet the way they were designed to be used.\n\nYou have to adapt to barefoot or FiveFingers running very carefully and slowly. Much of the impact that used to shoot into your knees and hips now gets absorbed by your calf muscles. Those muscles will get very sore at first and then very strong. You have to wake up muscles all over your feet that you haven\u2019t been using. You have to toughen the bottoms of your feet. You can get blisters\u2014I wear five-fingered socks to prevent that. But I\u2019m loving running more than in many years. I feel throughout my body that I\u2019m doing something right that I always used to do wrong. If my experience and that of thousands of others is any guide, the FiveFingers phenomenon can only grow and spread. The age of the modern running shoe that began in the 1970s with Phil Knight and Nike could just possibly begin to enter its twilight.\n\nDo you agree with me that FiveFingers is a name to know in 2011? Please comment and let me know. I\u2019ve written this as part of Forbes\u2019s new \u201cNames You Need to Know in 2011\u2033 project. Find out about the project and how you can contribute to it here.\n\nPost Your Comment\n\nPost Your Reply\n\nForbes writers have the ability to call out member comments they find particularly interesting. Called-out comments are highlighted across the Forbes network. You'll be notified if your comment is called out.\n\nI hadn\u2019t seen that. Thanks. I see the government banned the shoes because they \u201cdetract from a military appearance,\u201d not because of any perceived physiological shortcoming in them. I guess the Army prefers guerrilla warfare to gorilla warfare.\n\nMy name is Michael Renwick. I am the PR Director for www.fiftysense.com. We are an information based site dedicated to educating through common sense ideas for active baby boomers. Our panel of testers, all over the age of 50, have been putting different fivefingers models to the test for over two years now. For a group with sore knees, less padding in their feet and an aversion toward new things\u2013they love them. http://fiftysense.com/reviews/vibram.shtml I thought a first-hand account from testers themselves might be useful. Let me know if fiftysense.com can be of any further use to you.\n\nI\u2019m a college student in Denver Colorado developing a complimentary product for this new emerging market. I bought my first pair of VFF\u2019s in 2009 at a mountaineering and outdoor store in Glennwood Springs, CO and couldn\u2019t believe the fit! (Prior to this I was a staunch shoe and sock wearer and never would consider walking anywhere bare footed.) Nor could I stop laughing for the first week every time I looked down at my feet. I am barely a novice climber and only run for enjoyment or out of necessity, so my perspective is a little different than most of the perspectives I\u2019ve found during my research thus far. I did not follow the suggestions by the company with regards to allowing myself to gradually work into wearing the shoes and I didn\u2019t experience much post exercise soreness or discomfort. However I didn\u2019t over exert my feet either. I certainly would not try running competitively in these shoes, especially right off the bat but over time I think they will provide an edge for all who wear them. I don\u2019t know about making the current shoe designs a thing of the past, but I am confident that these types of shoes will continue to grow in popularity.\n\nI am a non-runner. I will occasionally jog for a minute or two at a time during a warm up or cool down at the gym\u2026 However, I wear my VFFs to Zumba class at least 3-4 times per week (along with injinjii toe socks). All my life, I have had issues with blisters. I have never found a sneaker that was comfortable for walking all day or exercising. Every day at a theme park (and I live 2.5 hours from Disney World \u2013 so theme parks are just destined to be part of my son\u2019s growing-up years!) resulted in at least 4 or 5 blisters on each foot.\n\nI got my VFF KomodoSports a year or two ago. I was wary of spending $100 on a pair of shoes, considering that I\u2019ve never owned a truly comfortable pair of shoes. Moreover, I have high arches and always had a tendency to get cramps in my arches, and the beginnings of arthritis in my toes, which would have me removing my shoes and massaging my toes after about 20 minutes of a Zumba class. From the very first day of wearing my Vibrams, I have never had discomfort in my feet, and I have had at least a dozen theme park days with zero blisters.\n\nI intend to be a lifelong, faithful customer of Vibram FiveFingers. Who knows, maybe I\u2019ll even become a runner like my husband and son\u2026 or perhaps at least less of a non-runner!\n\nI don\u2019t like to be an apostate, but I just discovered Terra Plana\u2019s Vivobarefoot Evo II shoe. It looks more like an ordinary shoe, without articulated toes, but it\u2019s loose around its nice big toe box and holds your foot by the heel and ankle. The result, for me, is even greater comfort and an even fuller feeling of freedom than the Fivefingers. And you can wear it anywhere without drawing as much attention.\n\nI\u2019ve also, incidentally, found that I was making the balls of my feet hurt a little by being too protective of my heels, barely touching them to the ground when I ran. I\u2019ve learned to run almost flat-footed, bringing down the front of the foot slightly before the rest, but all of it down firmly.\n\nThe crazy appearance and getting to chit-chat with perfect strangers is half the fun ;-)\n\nFor me, having the separated toes is a large part of the comfort, though just wearing the injinjii socks with regular sneakers gives me some improvement compared to regular socks. I just have crazy feet that love these crazy shoes. The FedEx guy will be here with a new pair today and the UPS guy will bring another pair on Friday!\n\nAnother thing, I love about the VFFs is how well they hold up in the wash (as they\u2019re machine washable), how quickly they dry (I clip them on a hanger to dry) and how clean they get. I\u2019ve worn my to mow the lawn and had them clean and dry for fitness classes the next day!"
