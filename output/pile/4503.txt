This will prevent Fody from injecting equality checking code. The FodyWeavers.xml file could now look as follows:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?>\n<Weavers>\n  <PropertyChanged CheckForEquality='false'/>\n</Weavers>\n\nAs noted in the comments there is also the possibility to do this per property via the DoNotCheckEquality attribute e.g.\n[ImplementPropertyChanged]\npublic class Person \n{\n    [DoNotCheckEquality]\n    public string Name { get; set; }\n}\n\nSee wiki/Attributes\n\n"
