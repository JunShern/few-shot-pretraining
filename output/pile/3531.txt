    "text": "Q:\n\nPython print hyperlinked text to Spyder Console\n\nI'm using the WinPython distribution on Windows 7, which comes with the Spyder IDE (and I hope this will work the same on Anaconda).  I would like to know how to print hyperlinked text to the console output.\nI assume it's possible, because when I get an error in my code, I get the traceback that shows me where it crashed, and those links are clickable, and will then open the line of the function where it raised the error.  See below:\n(I can't post the image without 10 rep, that's lame, I'm new to the site)  See here: http://i.stack.imgur.com/oJ3Aw.png\nHowever, I don't want to just open a file within the IDE, what I want to do is have a link to the folder location where my code just saved some plot images to disk, and when I click on the link, have it open the folder within windows explorer.  Bonus points if there is a platform independent way of doing this, but a windows only solution would be sufficient for me.\nI have some previously existing Matlab code that would do this for me, but I can't determine if there is a Python equivalent:\nsave_path = pwd;\nfprintf('Plots saved to: <a href=\"matlab: web(''%s'',''-browser'');\">%s</a>\\n',save_path,save_path);\n\nA:\n\nIt has been deprecated.\nI find a reference here:\nhttps://github.com/pydata/pandas/pull/7499#issue-36016539\n\n"
