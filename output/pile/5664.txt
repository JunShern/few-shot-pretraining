I agree with Obama for what he's done for gay rights, but not the economy and jobs. I have been on Atripla since 2010 and thankfully Ryan White grant has enabled me to get my meds free of charge. So here's my question...exactly how does the Supreme Court's upholding of the Obama healthcare law affect those of us with HIV and who are on Ryan White? I also have insurance, but it hardly would make a dent in the cost of my HIV medication without Ryan White...theres a lot of bullshit and spin comng out of the mouths of politicians. So how does the healthcare law affect people like me who have HIV, and are on meds?\n\nAs fate would have it, I am due to go down to my clinic today for an appointment and some pills, so I am planning to ask about this directly today. I am also on RW and ADAP. I am wondering how this might change things up through my IDP.\n\nI imagine others will have some feedback for you, but I'll try to post what I'm told later today or tomorrow.\n\nRW/ADAP was renewed up until 2014, after that things may/probably will change\n\nthe American Academy of HIV Medicine explains it well on their site\n\nQuote\n\nStarting in 2014 thousands of Ryan White patients who previously received care and treatment through the Ryan White program will begin to receive coverage through other programs created under the ACA. A majority will become part of the new Medicaid expansion; another portion are likely to gain coverage through the State Insurance Exchanges and the new state Pre-Existing Condition Plans (PCIPs).\n\nBecause Ryan White is a \u201cpayer of last resort\u201d program, those patients who will have access to the new programs must use them first.However, since the states will have significant flexibility in establishing the new programs, it is possible that some former Ryan White patients may end up with insufficient benefits, inadequate access to medications, or possibly even less than adequate access to care. They may also see new or increased co-pays, deductibles, or other cost-sharing. It is possible that the Ryan White Program may be able to aid in supplementing some of these areas.\n\nRyan White providers and clinics will likely help transitioning into these new systems, and ensuring inclusion in the new networks of care. Providers need to pay attention to the requirements and opportunities in their state to be included in the billing networks, referral networks, and care networks for their state\u2019s Exchanges and state Medicaid program.\n\nMost of the provisions of the ACA do not take effect until 2014, and their overall effects of ACA implementation will not become clear until sometime after that. The Ryan White Program as a whole will likely see many changes. Some of these may include the types of patients accessing services, to what services are provided, how those services wrap around the new systems. However, it seems as though there will ultimately be a significant need for the Ryan White safety net after 2014.\n\nThe Ryan White Program was reauthorized in 2009 through September 30, 2013. One positive change in the 2009 reauthorization was the removal of the \u201csunset\u201d provision that had existed under previous reauthorizations.\n\nMy pharmacy bill is just over $3600 each month which is 3X my SSDI income. It is paid by Medicare Part D, and other insurances. The other insurances are Medi-Cal and ADAP.\n\nA few years ago the Medi-Cal budget was cut so hard our ASO had to terminate Nurse visits. The ASO was also hit with the loss of RWCA Title I funding and struggle to serve a growing list of clients. In addition, Medi-Cal cut alternative medical practices, dental, vision and chiropractic. Our ASO had to close it's Russian River office and their main office which was once thriving with program, support services and staff, now looks like ghost town parade. I have been self case managed for about 5 years. That was Sonoma, they didn't put up much of a fight for their funding.\n\nIn San Francisco, which remains a Title I EMA, 6 million was taken from the budget. Mayor Ed Lee has replaced the Title I funds for AIDS services in San Francisco for 2 years.\n\nBeing already more than 133% below the poverty level, a 1/2 price reduction in the cost of medications are still not affordable. I will be really old in 2020 and wonder, who is going to pay for my medications then? Have the best dayMichael\n\nIn San Francisco, which remains a Title I EMA, 6 million was taken from the budget.

While I'm very happy for all the people the health care law will impact in a positive way Im aware that for some of us on medicare who still face the same problems shouldn't count on much more happening for a long time in regards to any new reforms in heath care , its a great start but we sure have a long way to go before we feel the relief . No pun intended but we must stay positive .\n\nIts a sobering thought isn't it .

He walked neighborhoods, knocked on doors, stopped people on the street and spoke at every opportunity to find out what the American people want and need. Access to healthcare for all! The President has my vote and I am just looking at the possible details and how they concern me. Have the best dayMichael\n\nI am not sure how any of this will work out. My new case workers is so green behind the ears she actually believes we have laws that protect people. lol....Anyway, she told me they are under great pressure to get people off RWhite and onto the high risk pool for the state. I looked it up and you can not get a straight answer from their own web site. It will be anywhere from 199 to 600 per month for limited coverage and a one million dollar cap. There will be co-pays for everything.\n\nShe informed me that under the risk pool that R.White would pay the premiums and co-pays and still save money over the old method. This made no sense to me, how can they save money by paying the premiums and co-pays. They also will allow a total income of 32 thousand gross and remain in the pool.\n\nUnder R White I am currently allowed two doctor visits per year and they pay for my meds.\n\nI am going to give it one more try possibly with someone who is older and has more experience in the system but this may prove difficult as the case workers tend to hang around for a year or two at the max and then you get the nice letter saying they have moved up in the organization and I would be getting a new case worker.\n\nShe informed me that under the risk pool that R.White would pay the premiums and co-pays and still save money over the old method. This made no sense to me, how can they save money by paying the premiums and co-pays.\n\nRight now, RW often pays the premium and co-pays for people who are financially eligible for ADAP. Since many HAART regimens cost around $2500 to $3000 per month, covering someone's insurance premium and co-pays is a lot less expensive than having to purchase the meds outright.\n\nI am going to give it one more try possibly with someone who is older and has more experience in the system but this may prove difficult as the case workers tend to hang around for a year or two at the max and then you get the nice letter saying they have moved up in the organization and I would be getting a new case worker.\n\nyou may not get many answers right now. AHA won't be going into full effect, especially in regards to RW, until the RW act comes up for renewal in 2014. By then many things will have changed as some states will have created high risk pool, expanded their medicaid programs and created health care exchanges; while other states won't have any of that and won't be accepting any federal funds.\n\nif you re-read the large quote I posted from the American Academy of HIV Medicine website, and realize that it was just this last week the Supreme Court finally upheld the AHA so that it can now aggressively move forward, you'll understand that many of the details you're looking to find are probably just now starting to be worked out for a hopeful transition in 2014. I hope you can find out more about your situation; but in the middle of an transition from RW to AHA there may not be many answers for you quite yet.\n\nLogged\n\nleatherman (aka mIkIE)\n\nAll the stars are flashing high above the seaand the party is on fire around you and meWe're gonna burn this disco down before the morning comes- Pet Shop Boys chart from 1992-2015Isentress/Prezcobix\n\nBC/BS offers 3 plans Basic, Enhanced, and Premium. I can not afford any of them today. I called the toll free number for a quote from an Agent. She said: Nothing is in the works now because the election is close and Obamacare will be replaced with whatever Mitt Romney has planned.\n\nThe advantage to being on Medicare/Medi-Cal for prescription coverage, over the person who already has private insurance is... The Medi/Medi client can change coverage any time of the year, while the private insurance client can only change vendors at the beginning of the year.\n\nThe Formulary, plan pricing, premiums and deductibles will be available to the Sales Staff on October 1st for the year 2013.

I have found a scale w/ 1-10 member families, where a 1 person family has to make $903.00 per month (last year). That same 1 person family may not have over $3000 in property but... I can not find a maximum income amount to qualify in the documents I have filed. Have the best dayMichael\n\nOnce I got medicare A, B in 2000, medical told me, that you are on your own, I only got that when I didn't have any health Ins. after my Cobra & Obra run out, due to having a per-exstsing condition...Full-Blown-AIDS\n\nMy guess ( If I wanted to move back to Nor-Cal) I would still get ADAP, but NOT medical, and I would probably have to sign all of my medicare over to an HMO, County Hospital, or something else to get Health care, like Labs, and Doctors Visits, I had Kaiser Permanente back then with co-pays for these such things....\n\nIf things go really south & downhill for me, I can always use the VA\n\ndunno, I feeling very home-sick for Nor-Cal, and kinda done with ABQ, I don't wanna die here, as I'm not a real native of New Mexico, Nor-Cal is my home and I miss my family\n\nLogged\n\n\"it's so nice to be insane, cause no-one ask you to explain\" Helen Reddy cc 1974\n\nToday, I was at the Pharmacy picking up my monthly refills. The Pharmacist meets me once each month for less than 5 minutes and always remembers my name. Not bad in a city of 722,000 people... She does not know how much will be paid by whom in 2014 but will contact all of the client/patients when they do know. Not much more can be done until October 1, 2013. Have the best dayMichael"
