I'd like to be able to call  \nWebConfigurationManager.AppSettings[\"ApiKey\"]\n\nwithin the Web.config file, or something similar.\n\nA:\n\nI think the short answer to your question is no.  The config files cannot include C# code like you are trying to add out of the box.  \nI did find another post that asks a question very similar to this. Its from a few years back, but there is a lot of feedback in it that looks like it may apply here.  Rather than trying to summarize the top answer, I will just add a link. Variables within app.config/web.config\n\n"
