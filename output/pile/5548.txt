I\u2019m going to try to make a Top Metal list too, but no promises.\n\nAt 30 entries, this is the longest Top Drone list I\u2019ve made. But I\u2019ve been eschewing reviews lately and focusing on AGB Radio and A Thick Mist, so I figure 30 is acceptable if you count how many records I\u2019ve directly recommended over the past year.\n\nI seem to continually expand my definition of what a Drone Record is, which means there\u2019s probably a few on here that are stretching the confines of that label, but I still did my best to try to keep it as Drone as possible.\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of reoccurring themes in here. Namely, lots of voices/singing (11 have vocals present at least somewhere on the record) and lots of organs & harmoniums. Neither of those are all that surprising, though. But there\u2019s two solo records from drummers, so that\u2019s kinda cool. There\u2019s also two heavily inspired by traditional Indian music, also kinda cool.\n\nI had fun with this one. I changed a few things up this year. First, I decided to exclude any artist that\u2019s been on any previous list. This meant no Sa\u00e5ad, Roly Porter, Andrew Weathers, Sarah Davachi, Mamiffer, Ian William Craig, Danny Paul Grody, Jefre Cantu-Ledesma, etc. (Seriously though go listen to the new Sa\u00e5ad and Mamiffer records.) No one likes to see the same people on such a niche list over and over again, so this was a good way to keep things new and exciting.\n\nThe other thing I decided to do was not rank this in the traditional way. Instead, I put the records in positions 7-30 into four groups of six, and the records within each group aren\u2019t ranked. So that means the records in group 7-12 aren\u2019t ranked, aside from me liking them more than the previous 13-30 drone records. I did this except for the top 6, which are ranked traditionally. I hope it\u2019s not too confusing.\n\nAs usual, I try to keep the Big Droners off this list because anyone who\u2019s a fan of drone probably already knows that Eluvium and Tim Hecker put out records this year and while their music is A+ Amazing, they don\u2019t really need a little DIY blog to help them out.\n\nThanks for reading. Thanks for listening. Thanks for making incredible music."
