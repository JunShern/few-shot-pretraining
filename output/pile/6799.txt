Introduction {#sec1}\n===============\n\nSeveral anatomical access points and methods to gain central venous access have been described. The axillary, cephalic, and subclavian veins, as well as the internal and external jugular veins, have all been used to insert pacemaker or defibrillator leads.\n\nThe axillary vein has become an emerging technique for the placement of pacing and defibrillation leads for several reasons. Unlike the cephalic vein, the main advantage of the axillary vein is that it is almost always large enough to accommodate multiple pacing leads. When compared to the subclavian vein, the properly-accessed axillary vein affords a less angulated course ([Fig.\u00a01](#fig1){ref-type=\"fig\"}). This potentially decreases mechanical stress (subclavian crushing syndrome) on the implanted leads or catheters, hence resulting in a lower incidence of mechanical lead failure or vein occlusion \\[[@bib1],[@bib2]\\]. Compelling evidence has implicated the infraclavicular musculotendinous complex in mechanical lead failure and occlusion of subclavian catheters \\[[@bib3],[@bib4]\\].Fig.\u00a01Fluoroscopic comparison of the course of the leads with ultrasound-guided axillary vein puncture (left image), and subclavian puncture (right image). The angulation and potential mechanical stress on the leads are significantly marked with the subclavian access (white arrow).Fig.\u00a01\n\nAdditionally, subclavian access portends the risk of inadvertently accessing the non-compressible subclavian artery and the potential for increased mechanical stress on the lead or indwelling catheter from crossing the subclavius muscle and the clavipectoral fascia. Finally, unlike the jugular system, the use of the axillary system does not require tunneling of the leads over or under the clavicle.\n\nTechniques for accessing the axillary system with the use of fluoroscopic (either with or without venography) or ultrasounds (US) imaging have also been used \\[[@bib5],[@bib6]\\]. The landmark (fluoroscopy) approach is associated with a significant risk of arterial puncture, pneumothorax or failed access \\[[@bib7]\\]. In addition, the current trend is to implant under antithrombotic therapy (ATT), because the perioperative bridging of anticoagulation is associated with a higher risk of thromboembolic events \\[[@bib9]\\]. A previous study reported a greater use of pressure dressings with ultrasound-guided axillary vein puncture (UGAVP) \\[[@bib10]\\]. This may suggest a higher risk of bleeding in comparison with the cephalic approach. It is to note that cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) with triple leads placement by UGAVP, and upgrade procedures (i.e. in the presence of preexisting leads) have not been described.^[4,11]{.smallcaps}^\n\nWe aimed to assess the incidence of complications using UGAVP in patients under ATT, including CRT and upgrade procedures. The learning curve of UGAVP use for routine practice will also be assessed in this study.\n\n2. Methods {#sec2}\n==========\n\n2.1. Patients selection {#sec2.1}\n-----------------------\n\nProspectively, all consecutive patients eligible for cardiac devices implantation (i.e. pacemaker, defibrillator, CRT or upgrading) in whom an UGAVP was performed were included in this study, at two centers: Princess Grace Hospital in Monaco between September 2014 and September 2015, and Mohammed VI university hospital in Marrakech Morocco between October 2016 and April 2018. All the patients gave their written consent for the procedure.\n\n2.2. Ultrasound-guided venous puncture {#sec2.2}\n--------------------------------------\n\nTo access the vein with sonography, the patient was placed in the supine position, without Trendelenburg, and the patient was prepared in the usual sterile manner ([Fig.\u00a02](#fig2){ref-type=\"fig\"}).Fig.\u00a02Patient installation in the catheter laboratory with position of the probe during puncture.Fig.\u00a02\n\nA surface vascular US probe was inserted into a sterile plastic sleeve and used to image the axillary vasculature. Real-time US imaging of the spatial relationship of the artery and vein, and of the course of the access needle visually guided the venous puncture. A local anesthesia by lidocaine hydrochloride 2%, under US visualization was made along the course of the puncture needle.\n\nUsing an out-of-plane technique, the vein was centered in the middle of the screen with the probe held with the left hand perpendicular to the skin ([Fig.\u00a02](#fig2){ref-type=\"fig\"}, [Fig.\u00a03](#fig3){ref-type=\"fig\"}). An 18-gauge, 7-cm length Cook bevel-tipped needle was introduced and advanced with the right hand below the US probe towards its center while watching for tissue movement on the US screen and maintaining negative pressure on the plunger. Once the needle is seen to enter the vein and blood flashes into the syringe, the syringe was removed and a guidewire was placed into the lumen. From this point, a sheath and dilator may be placed in the usual fashion.Fig.\u00a03Ultrasound image of a left axillary vasculature.Fig.\u00a03\n\nNo time limit was set. No internal jugular access was used. Puncture time was defined as time between US visualization of the axillary vein to the insertion of the guidewire in the superior vena cava.\n\nAll procedures were performed by a single operator, experienced with UGVP for femoral access, and fluoroscopy-guided axillary vein puncture \\[[@bib12]\\].\n\nA learning curve defined as UGAVP time evolution was established. Procedure time, but also complications were systematically studied: hematoma, pneumothorax, hemothorax.\n\n2.3. Management of antithrombotic therapy {#sec2.3}\n-----------------------------------------\n\nATT (Aspirin, Clopidogrel, Ticagrelor, Dabigatran, Rivaroxaban, Apixaban, low weight molecular heparin and Vitamin K Antagonists \\[VKA\\]) were continued until and after the procedure. In VKA patients, International normalized ratio (INR) target was 2--3 the day of the procedure. The implantation was postponed if the INR was greater than 4.\n\n2.4. Follow-up {#sec2.4}\n--------------\n\nAll patients were monitored in the hospital at least two nights after the implantation. After hospital discharge, patients were followed in our outpatient clinic at 1, 6, and 12 months.\n\nAxillary access points checks were performed at the end of the procedure, the following day after dressing removal and before discharge. Vascular access complications, including hematomas, were categorized as major if they resulted in prolongation of hospitalization, repeat hospitalization, blood transfusion, or surgical intervention; or minor (hematoma without hospital stay lengthening).\n\n2.5. Statistical analysis {#sec2.5}\n-------------------------\n\nThe statistical analysis was made with GraphPad Prism 5 (San Diego, CA, USA). Numerical variables are expressed as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD.\n\n3. Results {#sec3}\n==========\n\n3.1. Patients population {#sec3.1}\n------------------------\n\nPatients characteristics are summarized in [Table\u00a01](#tbl1){ref-type=\"table\"}. 200/457 (43.76%) patients were included: 164 (82%) patients received a pacemaker and 36 patients (18%) received an ICD. The study population was composed by 54 (27%) patients with CRT. Among them, 26 patients (13%) underwent a triple insertion of new leads implanted in the axillary vein. 180 (90%) patients were under ATT ([Table\u00a01](#tbl1){ref-type=\"table\"}).Table\u00a01Baseline characteristics and procedural data.Table\u00a01Number of patients200Age (y)77.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010 \\[44--94\\]Male, n (%)116 (58)Body Mass Index (kg/m^2^), n (%)\\<25: 58 (29)\\\n\\>25: 148 (74)Type of procedure (devices), n (%)VVI: 44 (22)\u00a0PM 36 (18)\u00a0ICD 8 (4)CRT/CRT-D: 54 (27)\u00a0CRT-D: 24 (12)\u00a0Upgrade:6 (3)\u00a03C: 10 (5)\u00a0BiV: 8 (4)\u00a0CRT-P: 30 (15)\u00a0Upgrade: 8 (4)\u00a03C: 16 (8)\u00a0BiV: 6 (3)DDD: 100 (50)\u00a0PM: 98 (49)\u00a0ICD: 2 (1)VDD: 2 (1)\u00a0ICD: 1 (1)ICD/PM:\u00a0PM: 164 (82)\u00a0ICD: 36 (18)Side of implantation, n (%)Left: 174 (87)\\\nRight: 26 (13)Major vascular complications, n (%)0 (0)Minor vascular complications, n (%)1 (0.5)Procedure time (min)75.13\u00a0\u00b1\u00a044.3 \\[25--205\\]Fluoroscopy time (min)8.46\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.71 \\[0.5--50\\]Antithrombotic therapy, n (%)No ATT 20 (10)/ATT 180 (90)Anticoagulation 104 (52)\u00a0VKA 48 (24)\u00a0DOAC 46 (23)\u00a0Apixaban 14 (7)\u00a0Dabigatran 4 (2)\u00a0Rivaroxaban 28 (14)\u00a0LWMH 10 (5)Antiplatelet therapy 82 (41)\u00a0Single APT 74 (37)\u00a0Aspirin 62 (31)\u00a0Clopidogrel 4 (2)\u00a0Prasugrel 2 (1)\u00a0Ticagrelor 2 (1)\u00a0Dual APT 8 (4)Anticoagulant\u00a0+\u00a0APT 10 (5)Dual ATT 18 (9)[^1]\n\n3.2.

Axillary vein visualization was obtained in 95% of the cases ([Table\u00a02](#tbl2){ref-type=\"table\"}).

Mean puncture time per guidewire was 2.52\u00a0min. Mean puncture duration evolution over the time is illustrated in [Fig.\u00a04](#fig4){ref-type=\"fig\"}. The learning curve associated with this technique was estimated to 15 patients, corresponding to the beginning of puncture time plateau ([Fig.\u00a04](#fig4){ref-type=\"fig\"}).Fig.\u00a04Ultrasound-guided axillary vein puncture learning curve for devices.Fig.\u00a04\n\n3.3. Complications {#sec3.3}\n------------------\n\nThere was only one minor complication (hematoma: it was the 5th case with failure of UGAVP and conversion to a blind subclavian vein puncture), after a mean follow-up of 45\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010 months. This patient (with prosthetic mitral valve) was excluded from analysis because the complication occurred with a subclavian puncture.\n\n4. Discussion {#sec4}\n=============\n\nThe present study supports a wide and safe use of UGAVP for cardiac devices implantation (pacemakers, ICDs and CRT), especially in patients under ATT. UGAVP resulted in low incidence of complications. This is a fast and short-learning curve technique.\n\nThe \"blind\" or fluoroscopy-guided axillary vein puncture often implies a collapse of the vein in patients in a fasting state, while US allow direct visualization and can be of a precious help by predicting inter-individual anatomical variations.\n\n4.1. Prior experience with ultrasound guidance ([Table\u00a03](#tbl3){ref-type=\"table\"}) {#sec4.1}\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNash et *al* first described the use of two-dimensional US for pacemaker lead implantation in 70 patients in 1998 \\[[@bib8]\\]. The authors found that the use of US for placement of pacemaker leads was a safe technique but needed a significant \"learning curve\" in that nearly all of the unsuccessful cases were in the first half of the series. No major complications were reported. Orihashi et *al* described their experience in 18 patients and found a 90% success rate within two attempts using longitudinal imaging within the pacer pocket and a freehand technique \\[[@bib13]\\]. The authors observed the ease of compressibility of the vein by the needle, and the utility of short jabbing motions to image the needle tip and facilitate venipuncture. Finally, Jones et *al* demonstrated in 60 patients that the learning curve for US access was short, and that US guidance led to a reduction in lead placement time (8\u00a0min versus 12\u00a0min) and fluoroscopy time compared with the cephalic approach even after inclusion of training. Nevertheless, there was a significant greater use of pressure dressings in comparison with the cephalic approach \\[[@bib7]\\]. In comparison to the subclavian puncture, the absence of pneumothorax can be explained by the extra-thoracic course of the puncture ([Fig.\u00a01](#fig1){ref-type=\"fig\"}).\n\nIn the present study, no complications were observed with UGAVP. Our series also reported a higher number of leads implanted in comparison with previous studies (139 leads in total), confirming the possibility to implant multiple leads with this technique (including ICD leads), but also the potential benefit in case of upgrade procedures.\n\n4.2. Anatomic variations and role of ultrasounds {#sec4.2}\n------------------------------------------------\n\nIn 2003, Galloway and Bodenham published their experience in using US guidance to define the axillary system \\[[@bib14]\\]. The authors examined 50 patients with US. Their data showed that the Trendelenburg position only afforded a 1\u00a0mm (12--13\u00a0mm) increase in the diameter of the axillary vein and that the arm position did not cause significant differences in the vessel size or US visibility. In this study, it was observed that as the axillary vein coursed laterally, its diameter decreased (from 12.2\u00a0mm to 8.5\u00a0mm), its depth increased (from 19.5\u00a0mm to 32.2\u00a0mm), and its proximity to the axillary artery decreased (from 3.4\u00a0mm to 8.9\u00a0mm). Anatomic variations of the axillary vein and its tributaries were noted in 27.5% with duplicated axillary vein in 5% \\[[@bib15]\\]. Additionally, the variations in branching pattern of the axillary artery were found in 62.5% \\[[@bib16]\\]. Furthermore, the rib cage to vein distance is variable (0.2--2.2\u00a0cm) \\[[@bib11]\\].\n\nIn cases the BMI\u00a0\\>\u00a025\u00a0kg/m^2^, there was a significant difference in depth, and a trend to significant differences in diameter. However, age-specific differences in depth and diameter were not observed \\[[@bib17]\\]. These anatomical variations are clinically significant and can increase the risk of vascular complications and pneumothorax with a blind technique. The use of US allows the operator to appreciate anatomic variations in arterial, venous and rib cage spatial relationships, as well as of the vessels themselves. Such imaging provides visualization of the access needle tip course and trajectory.\n\nIt has been well recognized that the use of real-time US guidance during central line insertion is one of the patient's safety practices with the greatest strength of supporting evidence \\[[@bib18],[@bib19]\\].\n\nA randomized controlled trial reported a higher first-attempt success rate and fewer needle passes with real-time US guided puncture compared with the anatomic landmark approach \\[[@bib20]\\].\n\n4.3. No perioperative bridging for anticoagulation {#sec4.3}\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n**In our department which is a reference center for atrial fibrillation ablation, ATT is routinely maintained, especially in patients with atrial fibrillation. This may explain that 90% of patients were on anti-thrombotic therapy which is unusually high compared to routine practice.** This practice is supported by data from large series, demonstrating that periprocedural continuation of anticoagulation not only confers protection against thromboembolic events but is also safe, as evidenced by the overall low rates of bleeding complications \\[[@bib5],[@bib6]\\]. In contrast with previous studies, despite the fact that implantations were performed with uninterrupted ATT, no major bleeding complications were observed, as opposed to previous studies \\[[@bib7]\\].\n\n4.4. UGAVP for ICD, CRT and upgrade procedures {#sec4.4}\n----------------------------------------------\n\nIn previous studies concerning UGVAP, ICD, CRT and upgrade procedures were excluded \\[[@bib4]\\]. In contrast, UGVAP was successfully performed for ICD (18 patients), CRT implantation (24 patients) and upgrade procedures (8 patients) in our study. Recent studies using the fluoroscopy-guided axillary vein puncture included some CRT devices, but this technique was not extended to the three leads, while it was possible in our series (11 patients) \\[[@bib21]\\].\n\n4.5. Limitations {#sec4.5}\n----------------\n\nThis study is bicentric and not randomized. The lack of a control group is a significant limitation of the study but this does not seem to diminish the quality of this study whose main objective was to verify the feasibility and safety of UGVAP in patients under ATT.\n\nNo vascular complication was reported in the present study with UGAVP, but the analysis involved a limited number of patients (n\u00a0=\u00a0200). There have been no randomized trials between the US-guided technique and either the cephalic approach, traditional landmark axillary technique, or fluoroscopic and venogram-guided techniques for pacemaker or ICD placement. However, the limited published literature concerning axillary access with US, including lead placement, has demonstrated a consistent reduction in time to access, number of attempts, and complications. US guidance has plausible benefits in reducing the risk of lead crush, pneumothorax, and hematoma, and may have particular utility in patients with preexisting leads. With advances in US imaging technology, increasing emphasis on patient safety, and trainees who are more familiar with US-guided access, the use of US in device implantation is likely to expand.\n\nThe additional cost associated with this technique has been approximated to 18.85\u20ac/procedure (cost of the sterile plastic sleeve). This cost may be added to the initial cost of a dedicated vascular probe, if not present in the catheter laboratory/operating room.\n\n5. Conclusion {#sec5}\n=============\n\nThe present study, as well as the recent literature, support wide use of UGAVP in patients under antithrombotic therapy undergoing cardiac devices implantation including ICD and CRT. The short learning curve should encourage every cardiologist to adopt this technique.\n\nAuthor's contribution section {#sec6}\n=============================\n\nDr Mohammed El Jamili and Dr Sok-Sithikun Bun have equally participated in the preparation of this manuscript.\n\nMohammed El Jamili[:]{.ul} Concept/Design; Data analysis/interpretation; Drafting article; Critical revision of article; Approval of article; Data collection.\n\nSok-Sithikun Bun[:]{.ul} Concept/design; Data analysis/interpretation; Drafting article; Critical revision of article; Approval of article; Data collection.\n\nDecebal Gabriel Latcu[:]{.ul} Critical revision of article; Approval of article.\n\nTahar Delassi[:]{.ul} Data collection.\n\nMustapha Elhattaoui[:]{.ul} Critical revision of article; Approval of article.\n\nNadir Saoudi[:]{.ul} Critical revision of article; Approval of article.\n\nDeclaration of competing interest\n=================================\n\nNone.\n\nPeer review under responsibility of Indian Heart Rhythm Society.\n\n[^1]: APT: antiplatelet therapy; ATT: antithrombotic therapy; BiV: biventricular; DOAC: direct oral anticoagulant; LWMH: low weight molecular heparin; PM: pacemaker; VKA: vitamin K antagonist; 3C: three chambers.\n\n[^2]: GW: guidewires; N/A: non-available; PM: pacemakers; SVC: superior vena cava.\n"
