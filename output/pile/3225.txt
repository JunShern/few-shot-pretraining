    "text": "MBA Program\n\nMBA Program - FAQ\n\nIs UCM accredited by AACSB International?\n\nYes. Choosing an AACSB-accredited institution should be important to you. Here's why. Accreditation by AACSB International indicates the business school's programs, faculty and funding are regularly reviewed and that processes are in place to continually evaluate and make improvements to the academic programs. It represents a standard of quality.\n\nThere are but 13 institutions in Missouri that are AACSB-accredited in Business. UCM is also accredited in Accounting.\n\nFor domestic applicants it is $30. For international applicants it is $75.\n\nCan I submit a GRE score in place of the GMAT?\nYes. Students can take the GRE instead of the GMAT. A predicted GMAT score, based upon GRE Verbal and Quantitative scores, can be used in place of a GMAT score in meeting requirements.\n\nDo I need to take prerequisite courses?\nYou might. We want to make sure you have the background necessary to be successful in the MBA program. Students who obtained a non-business, undergraduate degree need to complete twelve hours of prerequisites. If your undergraduate degree is in business, you may have already taken the four, three-hour courses:\n\nACCT 2101, Principles of Financial Accounting\n\nFIN 2801, Business Statistics I\n\nFIN 3801, Business Statistics II\n\nFIN 3850, Principles of Finance\n\nIn addition to the twelve hours of undergraduate credit listed above, candidates need to be familiar with Microsoft Office, especially Excel.\n\nDo the prerequisite courses have to be taken at UCM?\n\nNo. Equivalent courses from other regionally-accredited colleges and universities are accepted. You can check course equivalencies for the prerequisites. Courses may also be accepted based upon a review by the MBA Program Director in consultation with faculty. After acceptance to the program, please contact the MBA Program Director and submit a syllabus of the course to be reviewed.\n\nAre the prerequisite courses required for admission to the MBA program.\n\nNo. You may be admitted to the MBA program and then take needed preprequisites; however, you will not be allowed to take any of the six, core courses without completing the prerequisites. Rare exceptions are made in consultation with the MBA Program Director and course instructors. Other courses may require the prerequisites, as well.\n\nHow long does it take to complete the MBA?\nIt can take as little as 16 months!\nFull-time students who have all the prerequisites are able to complete the graduate course requirements in three, full semesters and a summer term: fall, spring, summer and fall.\n\nDo I have to be a full-time student?\nNo. You can take less than nine hours a semester, but you should plan to take at least six hours per term each of three semesters to complete the core course sequence.\n\nCan I start the MBA in the spring semester?\nYes. The core-course prerequisites do force a fall-spring-fall sequence; however, if you need to take prerequisite courses and/or do not wish to be a full-time student, spring is a great time to begin.\n\nWhat will be the tuition for one year?\nThe MBA at UCM is an outstanding value, especially for an AACSB-accredited institution. For information about graduate tuition and fees, please use our graduate cost calculator.\n\nAre the MBA classes offered during the day?\nAll the MBA core and most concentration required classes are offered at night, from 6-8:45 p.m. on the main campus in Warrensburg. The elective courses (three or six credit hours) may be offered during the day, at night or online.\n\nDo you offer an online MBA?\nAt this time, UCM does not. Most of the courses are delivered face-to-face in Warrensburg. One course may be offered online, depending upon the semester. BLAW 5700 is a hybrid course offered in the summer.\n\nWhat is Warrensburg like?\n\nThe 'Burg is a great college town approaching a population of 20,000 with Whiteman Air Force Base just down the road. There are plenty of things to do in Warrensburg, but when your entertainment and shopping preferences extend beyond those offered here, the Kansas City area is an easy 45 to 60 minute drive."
