The process of straightening your teeth might seem daunting, but with advances in dentistry and technology, it has become easier and remains worthwhile.\n\nHere are some reasons to straighten your teeth:\n\nBoost self-esteem - Getting your teeth straightened means no more having to hide crooked teeth. With a mouthful of straight, pearly whites, you\u2019ll want to show off that smile, and you\u2019ll feel new and revitalized.\n\nHealthier teeth - Having crooked teeth causes trouble chewing and increases the likelihood of tooth decay and gum disease. Straight teeth are easier to clean, are less likely to get chipped, and are more likely to lead to long-term overall oral health.\n\nWhat is Invisalign?\n\nOne popular method for straightening teeth is Invisalign, a treatment that involves the use of removable clear aligners. Unlike traditional metal braces, Invisalign aligners aren't attached to your teeth and don\u2019t dramatically alter your appearance.\n\nInvisalign aligners are made of a proprietary material that gently shifts your teeth into place. The clear aligners, which you exchange for a new set every week, fit snugly over your teeth. The aligners work best for teens and adults. Dr. Bello develops a customized monitoring plan to oversee your progress.\n\nWhat can Invisalign aligners fix?\n\nDr. Bello recommends Invisalign for teens and adults who are self-conscious about the appearance of traditional braces. Also, Invisalign aligners are more convenient, as they're typically less painful and inconvenient. She offers Invisalign for conditions such as:\n\nOverbite\n\nUnderbite\n\nOverly crowded teeth\n\nOverly spaced teeth\n\nTeeth shifting\n\nWhat are the benefits of Invisalign?\n\nInvisalign offers several benefits that make it a more attractive option than regular braces for many teens and adults. Some of those benefits include:\n\nClear material - Often, people can\u2019t even tell you are wearing braces\n\nRemovable aligners - You can take them out and eat what you want and brush and floss like normal, something you can\u2019t do with regular braces.\n\nMore time in between checkups - With Invisalign, you only need checkups every six weeks, as opposed to every four-weeks with traditional braces. Fewer appointments save you time and money."
