    "text": "Those Angeleno academics over at UCLA (along with a few others) were smug enough to suggest on Twitter that some tracking algorithm to come from the halls of Westwood in 2009, could have sped up the hunt for Osama.\n\nHey look, not bad for a class project! But as it also turns out, the final locale they predicted he was in, Parachinar, was nearly 500 kilometers away from Abbotabad. Not so close!\n\nIn the end, they zeroed in on a Pakistani border town called Parachinar which has, among other things, access to medical care. Then they predicted the exact building he would be in by making assumptions as to the characteristics of the building itself, such as high enough ceilings to accommodate bin Laden's 6'4\" frame, a fence, privacy, and electricity.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is I'm not gonna start crapping my pants and smearing it all over this post until some professor says they predicted his locale within a kilometer and pegged the probability at 99%. (I hold out hope that one of the Anteater-loving professors at my alma mater UC Irvine has done this and is too timid to point it out. Mostly just so I can smear shit all over this post.)
