Craven, III, Durham, North Carolina, for Appellant.\nRudolf A. Renfer, Jr., Assistant United States Attorney,\nMichelle T. Fuseyamore, Raleigh, North Carolina; David T.\nHuband, BUREAU OF PRISONS, Butner, North Carolina, for Appellee.\n\n\nUnpublished opinions are not binding precedent in this circuit.\n\n\n\n\n                                2\n\fPER CURIAM:\n\n                  In each of these consolidated appeals, Kevin Sean Polk\n\nappeals the district court\u2019s April 7, 2008 order continuing his\n\ncivil commitment to the custody of the Attorney General under 18\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 4246 (2006).          In Appeal No. 08-6527, Polk\u2019s counsel has\n\nfiled a brief pursuant to Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738\n\n(1967), raising one issue but stating that, in his view, there\n\nare     no    meritorious     grounds      for    appeal.      Counsel   questions\n\nwhether the district court erred in concluding that Polk posed a\n\nsubstantial risk of danger to others as a result of his mental\n\ndisorder.          Polk has filed a pro se supplemental informal brief\n\nin each appeal. \u2217         We affirm.\n\n                  After a hearing, the district court found by clear and\n\nconvincing evidence that Polk \u201ccontinues to suffer from a mental\n\ndisease or defect as a result of which his release would create\n\na substantial risk of bodily injury to another person or serious\n\ndamage to property of another.\u201d                   (J.A. at 33).       Our thorough\n\nreview of the record leads us to conclude that the district\n\ncourt       did    not   clearly   err    in     finding    that   continued   civil\n\ncommitment was warranted.                See United States v. Robinson, 404\n\nF.3d 850, 856 (4th Cir. 2005) (providing standards).\n\n\n        \u2217\n       We have reviewed carefully the issues raised in the pro se\nsupplemental informal briefs and find them to be without merit.\n\n\n\n                                            3\n\f           Accordingly,     we    affirm       the    order    of    the    district\n\ncourt.   We deny counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and dispense with\n\noral   argument   because      the     facts    and    legal    contentions        are\n\nadequately   presented    in     the    materials      before       the    court   and\n\nargument would not aid the decisional process.\n\n                                                                            AFFIRMED\n\n\n\n\n                                         4\n\f"
