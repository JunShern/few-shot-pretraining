All my basses are set for tapers so Id like to try out some different tapers before I change the set up. Thanks.\n\nI just got a set of fender taper wounds. UH DUH! on me - I wanted half rounds and didn't even realize i didn't know what taper wounds were. Yes, i thought they were smoother than roundwounds yet not quite flatwounds. Oh well - I put them on my fretless acoustic and they sound great.\n\nWhat's the advantage to these strings now that I know, after years and years of playing, what they are?"
