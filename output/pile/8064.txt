There is no doubt that he is an outstanding athlete. That\u2019s why the NY Jets wanted him. His particular skill set and athletic ability open up possibilities on the field including the wildcat formation.\n\nHow unusual is it that the other sports mania in recent times just recently occurred in NYC when Jeremy Lin emerged as something of a cult hero after catapulting to stardom as the New York Knicks point guard. Linsanity swept the city like few events before it. What do Tebow and Lin have in common? They both have openly discussed their evangelical faith.\n\nPersonally, I don\u2019t get it. What is the big deal that he bows down after a touchdown pass and gives thanks? I\u2019ve seen players pray on the sideline. There are prayer gatherings after a game to give thanks. It must be that Tebow speaks openly about his faith. Perhaps some people are afraid of it. Their sons and daughters might seek to be like Tebow. I can think of worse role models for young people to emulate.\n\nCritics have pointed out that God does not take sides in football games and to inject God\u2019s name as a form of thanks after throwing a touchdown pass minimizes what God really stands for \u2013 it is with the poor; with the down and out; it is with those seeking forgiveness.\n\nHowever, I did some research and found this quote from Psalm 121 (\u2018The Lord is Thy Keeper\u2019) of The Holy Bible: King James Version:\n\n\u201cI will lift up mine eyes unto the hills,\n\nfrom whence cometh my help.\n\nMy help cometh from the LORD,\n\nwhich made heaven and earth\u201d.\n\nWhen viewed in this context I have to believe Tebow is being a good Christian. Now I\u2019m not Christian, and I teach ethics but it is without a religious slant other than to say much of religious thought comes from the biblical passage: \"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.\" By extension, The Golden Rule calls on us to treat others the way we want to be treated \u2013 with respect, compassion, kindness, fairness, honesty, and so on.\n\nI tell my students that it does not matter what are your religious beliefs. But, believe in something; believe that it matters what you do and say while on this Earth; know that your actions have consequences and how you treat others triggers those consequences; and embrace the notion that we should strive to leave this Earth a better place than when we arrived.\n\nTebow demonstrated great character at the news conference this past Monday that introduced him to NY media. When asked about his role on the Jets given Mark Sanchez is the starting quarterback, Tebow said: \"However I can help the team, however I can make a difference, however they can use me, I'll be open to it and work as hard as I can every time I step on the field. I will give my whole heart and soul to being the best Jet I can possibly be in trying to help this team win football games.\"\n\nOne thing even Tebow\u2019s most ardent critics can\u2019t fault him for is his charity work. In addition to his missionary work with orphanages in the Philippines, he regularly brings sick children to his games through his foundation. Tebow brought Joey Norris, a young boy with cancer, to the playoff game against the New England Patriots, and where the Broncos suffered what he called a devastating loss.\n\n\u201cI was extremely disappointed,\u201d Tebow said. \u201cBut I still have a kid who is fighting for his life, and I have a choice to make. I can choose to sulk and feel pity after this loss and this disappointment. I can choose to try to go invest in him and try to encourage him and make him smile and be a part of his life. That really changes your perspective as a young man and as an athlete. For me to try to invest in him, he helped me more than I helped him on that night.\u201d\n\nThere is an old expression: \"The true measure of a man is how he treats someone who can do him absolutely no good.\" When applied to Tebow we can see how he fits the mold of a good role model for youngsters striving to be...well, the next Tim Tebow.\n\nThis is getting ridiculous people.
