Ideally, they also have superior products and services that\nsupport that purpose. But noble purpose and brilliant products won\u2019t get you\nfar if you don\u2019t have the right people to deliver them.\n\nIn other words, our who matters even more than our what and our why.\n\nThat makes selecting talent the most important task of\ntoday\u2019s leader. It\u2019s also the most difficult. So many managers don\u2019t understand\nhow to use the hiring process not just to fill a position, but also to truly\nadd value that enriches and complements the company\u2019s culture.\n\nI have worked at Chick-fil-A\u2019s corporate headquarters for\nmore than 30 years. I\u2019ve spent most of that time as Vice President of Corporate\nTalent, and my decades of experience and devoted personal study have led me to\nbelieve that hiring is an art, not a science. While that may seem daunting at\nfirst, especially to those of us who crave facts and precision, it\u2019s actually great\nnews. Hiring as an art abandons robotic coldness in favor of human intuition.\nWhen we combine our instincts with finely honed processes such as behavioral\nbased interviewing, we can achieve game-changing results.\n\nIn my new book It\u2019s My Pleasure: The Impact\nof Extraordinary Talent and Compelling Culture, I share secrets\nbehind the exceptionally effective business model Truett Cathy pioneered when\nhe founded Chick-fil-A in 1946. Truett\u2019s entrepreneurial philosophy was way ahead\nof the curve. Over the years, he emphasized to me time and time again that our\nbusiness was not about numbers, growth, or even chicken. To Truett, Chick-fil-A\nwas always about people.\n\nIn the midst of a fluid labor market in which individuals\nmove from company to company with expected regularity, Chick-fil-A\u2019s corporate\nstaff retention rate has remained at 95-97% for almost 50 years. I believe that success can be traced\nback in part to how we hire. Here are six guideposts to smart, soulful hiring,\nshaped by Truett\u2019s people-first ideology:\n\n1.Think\nhard about the role and carefully craft its description. How can you use\nthe new hire to address current weaknesses that may be slowing your staff down?\nTry also to think about the future instead of just the present.\n\n2.Expand\nyour search. In It's My Pleasure, I call it \u201ccasting a wide net.\u201d Different perspectives and experience from\nother industries can bring invaluable new energy to your team.\n\n3.Practice\nbehavioral based interviewing. Behavioral based questions push candidates\nto draw on how they\u2019ve responded to situations in the past. Instead,\ninterviewers often ask questions that can only be answered hypothetically,\nwhich is not the best way to learn how someone will actually act.\n\n4.Check\nreferences. Too many managers do not follow up with references thoroughly. This\ncalls for more than just verifying employment: Take the time to ask about past\nperformance, which we know is the best indicator of future performance.\n\n5.Talk the\ncandidate out of the job. Once you have decided to offer a candidate the\nposition, try to talk them out of accepting. This may sound counter-intuitive,\nbut it is an excellent way to gauge the individual\u2019s level of passion and\ndetermination for both the role and your company.\n\n6.Make a\ncommitment to the new hire. Once the job has been accepted, do all you can\nto ensure the new employee\u2019s success. They are your investment: Use the time\nand resources necessary to help them grow into the position.\n\nIn It's My Pleasure, I explore each of these suggestions in greater detail, along with other proven\nhiring techniques. While there are no one-dimensional solutions to the\nchallenge of recruiting and sustaining extraordinary talent, we can hold on to\none simple truth: When we put people at the center of our strategies, we gain\nso much more than added sales. One person at a time, we build a thriving,\ncompelling culture that extends far beyond business hours to impact the lives\nof everyone who comes into contact with it.\n\nThat is Truett Cathy\u2019s legacy, and one that is well worth\ntrying to emulate.\n\nAbout Dee Ann Turner\n\nDee Ann Turner is Vice President,\nCorporate Talent, for Chick-fil-A, where she began her career more than 30\nyears ago. Her first book, It\u2019s My\nPleasure: The Impact of Extraordinary Talent and a Compelling Culture,\nreveals never-before-shared secrets behind building and maintaining\nChick-fil-A\u2019s revolutionary business model.

Listen for what\u2019s important, even if you think\nyou already know.\n\nIf you feel compelled to respond while you are listening, try asking\nquestions that help the other person unfold their story. Avoid saying things\nlike: \u201cWell, you need to\u2026\u201d, or \u201cWhat if you just\u2026\u201d, or \u201cIt sounds like the\nproblem is\u2026\u201d. Instead, try asking questions that look for more information,\nlike: \u201cWhat\u2019s the most important thing to you in this?\u201d, or \u201cHow has this\naffected you?\u201d.\n\nWhether with a colleague, a partner or a stranger, it\u2019s obvious\nthat listening is useful in communication. But often in the stress of a\ndifficult conversation or conflict we don\u2019t really listen. Even when we think we are listening,\nwe are often caught up in getting ready to, or making, a suggestion.\n\nListening\nand making suggestions are two different actions. Each of these actions leads\nus in a different direction and tends to provoke different outcomes in\nconflict.\n\nI have found that the principle: \u201cWhen listening, avoid making\nsuggestions\u201d, often initially strikes people as odd. They say, \u201cIf I have a\ngood idea, why shouldn\u2019t I say it?\u201d, or, \u201cJust because I have a suggestion, it\ndoesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not listening.\u201d\n\nThere are\ntimes when it is important for us to offer our ideas, but there are many more\ntimes when the act of making a suggestion too early in the conversation can blind\nus to other options and get in the way of really hearing the information that the other person\nis trying to give us.\n\nIt can be very tempting to make suggestions when time is short\nor we feel uncomfortable in the pressure of a conversation. The urge to say\nwhat you think the problem is or which action the other person should choose\ncan be strong. However, what I have seen over and over, is that once people\ndecide to stop making suggestions for a while\u2014to stop telling other people what\nto do\u2014they are often shocked by how little they had really been listening. They\nare often equally surprised and delighted by how radically relationships can\nimprove and how beneficial the outcomes in conflicts can be when they listen\nfirst and look for solutions later.\n\nHere\u2019s two reasons why differentiating between the action of\nlistening and the action of making suggestions matters:\n\n1. Your\nstory is not their story.\n\nMaking suggestions is about your point of view. Listening is\nabout the other person\u2019s point of view. One of the most basic things that\npeople need in a conflict is to be heard. When we move from the action of\nlistening to the action of making a suggestion, we\u2019re changing the focus of the\nconversation from their point of view to our own point of view. If this change\nin focus happens too early in the dialogue, people often feel their story\nhasn\u2019t been heard. It then becomes more difficult for them to listen to the\nrest of the stories in the conflict.\n\n2. Solutions\nthat don\u2019t meet the needs of both sides usually fail.\n\nWhether we like it or not, in a conflict we need the other\nperson\u2019s story to be able to understand what is important and what kind of\nsolution might be possible and effective.\n\nListening is about allowing the landscape that you are both\ntraversing to become more visible, which makes it more possible to find a\npathway through it. Listening is a form of map-building.\n\nOffering a suggestion, on the other hand, is an attempt to find\na solution. It is a proposed pathway. But, if we don\u2019t have a good map of the\nlandscape, we can\u2019t know which path will get us where we want to go.\n\nOften it\u2019s tempting to try to find solutions as soon as\npossible, because conflict can be uncomfortable. But, if we do jump into a\nsolution too early, before we really know what\u2019s happening and what\u2019s important\nto people, then we are much less likely to find a solution that meets the needs\nof the situation\u2013 one that works and will last.\n\nSo, the challenge: in the next difficult conversation you\nencounter, stop making suggestions for a while and see what happens. Develop an\ninvestigatory mindset and find out what really matters in the situation. Build\ndetailed maps with people, even when you disagree, to see where you are and\nwhere you both want to go. Once you have this common ground, ideas and\nsuggestions from both sides can be more easily heard and become useful in\nhelping to find an effective pathway through the conflict.\n\nDana\nCaspersen is\nthe author of Changing the Conversation: The 17Principles of Conflict Resolution (Penguin, 2015), and works internationally as a conflict specialist,\npublic dialogue designer, speaker and award-winning performing artist.

One young woman shared her\ndistress when one of her best friends at work unfriended her on Facebook. The newly minted manager asked her friend,\n\u201cWhy the unfriend?\u201d She replied, \u201cYou\nare the boss now, and I don\u2019t want you creeping on my Facebook.\u201d It is not\nuncommon for there to be a bit of a cold spell while the relationship with a\npeer goes through redefinition.\n\nAt first glance, how\nyour peers see you and what your manager thinks about you are unrelated, but being\noverly concerned with your manager\u2019s estimation of you may inhibit your ability\nto effectively lead your peers and the development of your own leadership\nperspective.\n\nIf you find yourself\npre-occupied or even worried about what your boss thinks of you, give yourself\na break. One of the reasons you made it to management is because you cared and your\nboss saw something in you that she did not see in your peers or others. That something is usually a comfort level\nwith building a relationship with authority figures or appearing to be more\nmature than your peers. Perhaps you have heard your manager say things like,\n\u201cYou are different from other Millennials\u201d or \u201cYou are a throwback.\u201d The term\nthrowback refers to someone who appears to be from a generation older than\none\u2019s own. It could be flattering, but be aware, it could also set you up to be\nperceived as someone you are not. It is a good thing to want your boss to be\npleased with you. However, the danger comes when you become more concerned with\nthe approval of your boss than being your own person or exercising your own\nvoice. The slang behavioral diagnosis for those who\nquickly adapt what they think, say, and do in an effort to please their manager\nis brown nose\u2014the kiss of death for building\ncredibility with peers and exerting one\u2019s own voice.\n\nThe first\nstep to overcoming the desire to please your boss is to accept there will come\na day when you disappoint him or her\u2014not necessarily because you have done\nsomething wrong, but because you did something different from what they would\ndo. It is inevitable! Even the best of mentor/mentoree relationships end in\nconflict. It is a right of passage that eventually results in reconciliation\nand mutual respect. As an example, my mentor primarily consulted nonprofit\norganizations, and when I started working with major corporations, he was\ndisappointed. It hurt me to let him down, but I had to pursue my own path even\nthough it was emotionally difficult. Before he died, he affirmed me for having\nthe desire to help all kinds of organizations with generational diversity and valued\nmy work.\n\nThe\ntension you may experience with your manager is often the result of leading\nfrom your own perspective. Not unlike what you experience with peers, your\npersonal growth triggers a redefinition of the relationship with your boss.\nWhen you understand the relational dynamic that is taking place, there is no\nneed to be defensive, make excuses, or villainize. No need to fret. It is a\nsign of a new phase of your leadership development. One of the first stages of\nleadership development is to develop your own perspective.\n\nWhich\nleads to the second step of overcoming the need to please your boss\u2014develop\nyour own leadership perspective. What do you believe to be true? What are you\nconvinced of? What are you willing to stand for? How would you want to be\nmanaged? The young professionals in research my coauthor Joel Schwarzbart and I\nhave conducted talk about feeling torn between the way they wanted to manage\nand the way they thought their boss wanted them to manage. It was like having\ntheir boss on one shoulder and their preferred \u201cme\u201d on the other. The dialogue in\ntheir heads between the two created a migraine. The bipolarization also led to\ninconsistency in leader behavior.\n\nHaving a\nperspective can be quite powerful. A perspective can be as simple as, \u201cEveryone\ndeserves a second chance.\u201d Such a perspective has probably salvaged many a\ncareer. It is not true in every situation, but helpful in most. Not having your\nown perspective sets you up for being perceived as inauthentic and a mini-me of\nyour boss. Inauthenticity is the kiss of death for a young manager. Your peers\nwill not respect you, and ultimately your boss will be disappointed anyway.\n\nThe third\nstep is to understand that when a peer says you have changed for the worse or a\nmanager says you are not ready for the next level, it may be a function of them\nnot wanting their relationship with you to change. That is not a bad thing. You\nhave to keep it in perspective. It is not our enemies who hold us back from achieving\nour full potential\u2014it is usually those who care about us the most. When you\ngrow, advance, and seek new opportunities, it threatens relationships. If you\nget that, it will save you sleepless nights, the need to defend yourself, and self-doubt.\nEmbrace all kinds of feedback\u2014the good, the bad, and the ugly\u2014just have your\nown perspective."
