    "text": "Refried beans, soup, risotto, cheese and cornbread \u2014 those items may seem like innocuous vegetarian foods, but a lot of restaurants integrate animal fat or meat-based broths into them. (And, in case you didn\u2019t know, many cheeses, including Parmesan, contain rennet, which is cultivated from calf stomach.) If you\u2019re a vegetarian, how do you know what you\u2019re really eating?\n\nFor instance, Husk Restaurant\u2019s cornbread is made with bacon fat \u2014 that\u2019s why it tastes so good \u2014 but the menus at its locations in Greenville, South Carolina, and Nashville read as if it might be vegetarian (those dishes don\u2019t contain bacon crumbles), but at its sites in Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, explicitly list bacon on the menu.\n\ngrandriver via Getty Images\n\nCracker Barrel\u2019s corn muffins contain bacon drippings, but it isn\u2019t mentioned on the menu. On the other hand, Roscoe\u2019s House of Chicken and Waffles and Dirty Bird\u2019s cornbreads are free of animal fat. But how is a consumer really supposed to know?\n\nRecently, restaurant transparency has become more common, especially at fast-casual chains. In May 2018, the Food and Drug Administration created a rule stating that restaurants that are part of a chain with 20 or more fixed locations must disclose calories for \u201cstandard menu items listed on menus and menu boards.\u201d Some restaurants have taken the measure further by making allergen matrices and vegetarian/vegan info available to the public through their websites.\n\nMoe\u2019s Southwest Grill does one of the best jobs of fast-casual Mexican chains in offering a section for special diets \u2014 vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, nutrient-dense and keto. Its customizable vegetarian section mentions that the chain works with a nutritionist, and its cheeses and sour cream are animal rennet-free. Also, it cooks meat and veggies on separate grills. Moe\u2019s chief marketing officer, Verchele Wiggins Roberts, told HuffPost the company introduced the special menus late last year.\n\n\u201cWe noticed through web analytics that the Nutrition Calculator was one of the most visited pages on our website, so that tipped us off that there was an opportunity to better show our guests how to use our menu to better fit their lifestyle,\u201d she said. Like Chipotle, it offers organic tofu and more than 20 other vegetarian-friendly items. \u201cAt Moe\u2019s, it\u2019s really important for us to be transparent about our ingredients because we want to educate our fans on the ease of dining at Moe\u2019s, no matter what your lifestyle.\u201d\n\nOther Mexican chains are (mostly) doing a good job of catering to vegetarians. Chuy\u2019s refried beans don\u2019t contain pork fat (but some of their cheeses do contain rennet); Qdoba\u2019s website could be more detailed with vegetarian info, but a representative told HuffPost that its cheeses contain no rennet, the tortilla soup is made with vegetable broth and the refried beans do not have pork fat.\n\nMistakes have led to better transparency.\n\nThis level of transparency hasn\u2019t always existed, though. In 2011, Chipotle came under fire when a customer discovered the pinto beans he had been consuming for years had bacon in them; the secret ingredient wasn\u2019t stated on in-store menus. The outrage encouraged Chipotle to transform the beans into a vegetarian dish beginning in 2013.\n\nThunderdome Restaurant Group, based in Cincinnati, manages more than 30 restaurant locations nationwide, which includes concepts Bakersfield (tacos), The Eagle (fried chicken), Currito (fast-casual burritos) and Krueger\u2019s Tavern. In 2015, a few months after it opened in Cincinnati, Krueger\u2019s offered a polenta cake side (braised fennel and olives, tomato sauce, Parmigiano-Reggiano) but left out the fact the sauce contained bacon.\n\nPaul Grossmann via Getty Images Many cornbreads are made with bacon fat or lard. (Even your store-bought mixes aren't safe: Jiffy contains hydrogenated lard.)\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened. It might have been an oversight,\u201d Joe Lanni, Thunderdome co-founder, told HuffPost. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty sensitive to all that kind of stuff.\u201d (The item remains on the menu and now mentions the bacon.)\n\nEvery day, Lanni fields ingredient-based questions from customers, and he and the staff consider customers\u2019 special diets when developing recipes. \u201cThis is something we\u2019re thinking about: How are we going to list it on the menu, and how are we going to make sure people know? ... People want to know what\u2019s in [their food]. It\u2019s just a reality of doing business today. People are asking for it, and you need to arm your staff with that information. Otherwise, you\u2019re not doing a great job for your guests.\u201d\n\nNot all restaurants fall under the legislation that requires transparency.\n\nNew York City chainlet Xi\u2019an Famous Foods believes in transparency. On its website, the restaurant elucidates dishes that are vegetarian and vegan. This is because in 2017, NYC Health passed legislation that requires chains with 15 or more locations to display nutritional info (Xi\u2019an wavers between 14 and 15 locations).\n\nHowever, right now no legislation exists that would force restaurants to exhibit vegetarian info. \u201cI think restaurant owners have the same amount of obligation to inform guests just as if my grandmother is cooking and telling us what\u2019s in what dish she serves to family,\u201d said Jason Wang, Xi\u2019an\u2019s founder and CEO. \u201cI am not opposed to legislation that requires everyone to disclose info, but I just believe it should be fair and required for all.\u201d\n\nOnly a few of Xi\u2019an\u2019s dishes are vegetarian. Its spicy and sour spinach dumplings \u2014 stuffed with ground spinach and vermicelli noodles \u2014 sounds like it\u2019s vegetarian, but Wang said the sour and spicy dumpling broth is simmered in the same water that its lamb dumplings are cooked in. Wang said adding the meat ingredient to the menu description would make it \u201cverbose,\u201d and he hoped Xi\u2019an\u2019s diners would already be familiar with what\u2019s in the soup.\n\nHe thinks one reason restaurants have become more limpid with ingredients is because of competition. \u201cFor example, if a burger has less calories and less fat and less sodium than a competitor\u2019s and tastes just as good or better, it\u2019s a competitive edge,\u201d he said.\n\nIf non-chains want to comply with providing nutritional info, it generates an obstacle that small businesses might not be able to afford. \u201cThink of the ethnic food establishments,\u201d Wang said. \u201cWill they have enough expertise to follow all of the regulations there are now? What we will see is a decline of these establishments, and that\u2019s a shame.\u201d\n\nHow does a diner avoid accidentally ordering an item made with an animal product?\n\nAsking the wait staff questions about the menu seems like the ideal approach, but Wang said it\u2019s more complicated than that. \u201cIn this labor market, to have very dedicated servers that know enough about the food is an unspoken challenge that plagues most operators,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe simple answer is, have better-trained staff,\u201d Wang added. \u201cThe realistic situation is that there\u2019s just difficulties to that, due to qualified labor shortages. A lot of [mistakes] that make it to the news, I believe are due to lack of qualified labor in the economy. Automation helps, such as presenting ingredients\u2019 information to people using technology.\u201d"
