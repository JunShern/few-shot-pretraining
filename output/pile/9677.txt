When you read this passage in the Bible it seems quite daunting. What a paragon of a woman, but we have to realize this passage was about King Lemuel's mother advising him of what to look for in his search for a wife. She wanted him to find a woman who esteemed him greatly, (to put it in Jane Austen vernacular), and for him to esteem her in return.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-QczyJti2Jmo/XOVfESQAT7I/AAAAAAAAEGk/v-Nkz4YN2BMrv_rVah0yM-3l0PndmooRwCLcBGAs/s1600/Prov%2B31%2BWoman.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"800\" data-original-width=\"800\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-QczyJti2Jmo/XOVfESQAT7I/AAAAAAAAEGk/v-Nkz4YN2BMrv_rVah0yM-3l0PndmooRwCLcBGAs/s640/Prov%2B31%2BWoman.png\" width=\"640\" /></a></div>Even though the intent of these verses were to instruct a son, all Scripture is given for the edification and instruction to man (as in human kind). I've read, and agreed with, that God allowed these verses to be included in the Bible for two different reasons.<br /><br />TO INSTRUCT MEN in general on what to look for in a godly wife.<br /><br />TO INSTRUCT WOMEN on how to be a more Biblically-minded woman.<br /><br />Both are important to the Body of Christ - his church. So... here I go, diving into a Bible study that will help me esteem my husband more while at the same time, bring me closer in my walk with God.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NgPbIaeLv0c/W4XehbXT76I/AAAAAAAADu8/cPLObZ1Q7mEJ2hrrgp8fuk-UZ5oqbzkzgCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Always%2BWith%2BLove.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"100\" data-original-width=\"265\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NgPbIaeLv0c/W4XehbXT76I/AAAAAAAADu8/cPLObZ1Q7mEJ2hrrgp8fuk-UZ5oqbzkzgCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Always%2BWith%2BLove.png\" /></a></div><br />Sue Barrhttp://www.blogger.com/profile/06347249118943488564noreply@blogger.com0tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8317810105915057272.post-34014873465140297792019-05-17T12:55:00.002-04:002019-05-17T12:55:54.238-04:00First Page Friday ~ CAROLINE<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vmVMm6MVP60/XN7mdnn06EI/AAAAAAAAEGQ/AIGLSUdM3jUFkxeBJxpqdXJemMagA8GuQCLcBGAs/s1600/FPF%2B-%2BBlog.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"200\" data-original-width=\"800\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vmVMm6MVP60/XN7mdnn06EI/AAAAAAAAEGQ/AIGLSUdM3jUFkxeBJxpqdXJemMagA8GuQCLcBGAs/s1600/FPF%2B-%2BBlog.png\" /></a></div><br />I'm thrilled to share with you <a href=\"https://www.books2read.com/u/mVZBqP\" target=\"_blank\"><b><i><span style=\"color: #3d85c6; font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;\">CAROLINE</span></i></b></a>. She was my first Jane Austen Fan Fiction and the whole premise of the book began with one simple question.<br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif; font-size: large;\"><i><b>Whatever happened to Caroline Bingley after both her brother AND Mr. Darcy became engaged to the Bennet sisters?</b></i></span></div><br />The concept of what she felt and how she dealt with this crushing blow to her long held dreams galvanized me into who Caroline was when no one was around. And I delighted in presenting her with a man who saw beneath her calculating facade and actually liked her for who she was and what she could become.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><b>Blurb</b>:</span><br /><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"background-color: white; color: #333333;\">Caroline Bingley, beyond frustrated with her brother, Charles and Mr. Darcy both proposing to the Bennet sisters, dreads their upcoming nuptials. For three years her sole focus has been on attaining a marriage proposal from one Fitzwilliam Darcy of Pemberley, only to be foiled by a country miss with \u2018fine eyes\u2019. Adrift and not sure of her place in life, she meets the mysterious and devastatingly handsome Lord Nathan, who equally vexes and intrigues her.</span><br style=\"background-color: white; color: #333333;\" /><br style=\"background-color: white; color: #333333;\" /><span style=\"background-color: white; color: #333333;\">Lord Nathan Kerr, third in line to a Dukedom, had a well-earned reputation as a Rake. He cast all that and his noble title aside to become Mr. Darcy\u2019s vicar in Kympton, finding contentment in leading his small flock and doing the Lord\u2019s work. His plan for a quiet, country life is thrown into upheaval when he meets the fiery Miss Bingley. Can he reconcile his rising desire for the spoiled miss with how a vicar\u2019s wife \u2018should\u2019 behave?</span></span><br /><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><b>First Page:</b></span><br /><br /><div class=\"CH\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"><span style=\"font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;\"><i><span style=\"font-size: large;\">One</span><o:p></o:p></i></span></span></div><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"line-height: 150%; mso-pagination: none; text-indent: .3in;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"><span style=\"font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;\"><i>Caroline Bingley descended the grand staircase and proceeded toward the breakfast room, barely acknowledging the footman who efficiently pulled a chair away from the table for her.

Now, before you raise your suffragette bra in the air as a rallying cry, I'm not here to say women belong only in the kitchen and has no place in the boardroom. Women should go/do what makes them feel fulfilled.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-e6ercTcjq6k/XNv0GVZn_PI/AAAAAAAAEGE/2RaV3esn1lYaWIjNxNPKKU829nNb941MACLcBGAs/s1600/1950%2527s%2BFamily%2BDinner.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"319\" data-original-width=\"614\" height=\"331\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-e6ercTcjq6k/XNv0GVZn_PI/AAAAAAAAEGE/2RaV3esn1lYaWIjNxNPKKU829nNb941MACLcBGAs/s640/1950%2527s%2BFamily%2BDinner.jpg\" width=\"640\" /></a></div>The list below was taken from a 1950's Home Economics textbook intended for High School girls in preparation for married life. Apparently Snopes has discredited this claim, but I've read this in a few places and watched some YouTube programs (circa 1950's) which spout the same ideals. So... I think it's quite authentic.<br /><br />Here is the list:<br /><ol style=\"background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box; color: #4f6d67; font-family: &quot;Crimson Text&quot;; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 26px; padding: 0px;\"><li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; line-height: 2 !important; margin-left: 21px;\">Have dinner ready: Plan ahead, even the night before, to have a delicious meal \u2014 on time. This is a way of letting him know that you have been thinking about him, and are concerned about his needs. Most men are hungry when they come home and the prospects of a good meal are part of the warm welcome needed.</li><li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; line-height: 2 !important; margin-left: 21px;\">Prepare yourself: Take 15 minutes to rest so you will be refreshed when he arrives. Touch up your makeup, put a ribbon in your hair and be fresh looking. He has just been with a lot of work-weary people. Be a little gay and a little more interesting. His boring day may need a lift.</li><li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; line-height: 2 !important; margin-left: 21px;\">Clear away the clutter. Make one last trip through the main part of the house just before your husband arrives, gathering up school books, toys, paper, etc. Then run a dust cloth over the tables. Your husband will feel he has reached a haven of rest and order, and it will give you a lift, too.</li><li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; line-height: 2 !important; margin-left: 21px;\">Prepare the children: Take a few minutes to wash the children\u2019s hands and faces if they are small, comb their hair, and if necessary, change their clothes. They are little treasures and he would like to see them playing the part.</li><li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; line-height: 2 !important; margin-left: 21px;\">Minimize the noise: At the time of his arrival, eliminate all noise of washer, dryer, dishwasher or vacuum. Try to encourage the children to be quiet. Be happy to see him. Greet him with a warm smile and be glad to see him.</li><li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; line-height: 2 !important; margin-left: 21px;\">Some Don\u2019ts: Don\u2019t greet him with problems or complaints. Don\u2019t complain if he\u2019s late for dinner. Count this as minor compared with what he might have gone through that day.</li><li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; line-height: 2 !important; margin-left: 21px;\">Make him comfortable: Have him lean back in a comfortable chair or suggest he lie down in the bedroom. Have a cool or warm drink ready for him. Arrange his pillow and offer to take off his shoes. Speak in a low, soft, soothing and pleasant voice. Allow him to relax and unwind.</li><li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; line-height: 2 !important; margin-left: 21px;\">Listen to him: You may have a dozen things to tell him, but the moment of his arrival is not the time. Let him talk first.</li><li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; line-height: 2 !important; margin-left: 21px;\">Make the evening his: Never complain if he does not take you out to dinner or to other places of entertainment; instead, try to understand his world of strain and pressure, his need to be home and relax.</li><li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; line-height: 2 !important; margin-left: 21px;\">The goal: Try to make your home a place of peace and order where your husband can relax.</li></ol><div><span style=\"color: #4f6d67;\">No. 6 was my bug-a-boo early in our marriage.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"color: #4f6d67;\"><br /></span></div><div><span style=\"color: #4f6d67;\">My husband was with the Air Force, now retired and flying commercial aircraft.&nbsp; When the boys were little and he'd call home, I'd launch into a diatribe of what they'd done, how tired I was, etc., etc.. His frustration levels grew along with mine because, as a guy, he wanted to 'fix' my problems and couldn't. He was not physically there. He finally asked me to NOT tell him my issues. Not that he didn't care, but that he couldn't help. I learned early to bite my tongue and take care of things and keep things pleasant. He didn't need to worry about the family back home. Keep in mind, when in the military he was gone for weeks/months at a time.</span></div><div><span style=\"color: #4f6d67;\"><br /></span></div><div><span style=\"color: #4f6d67;\">Even now, with commercial aviation, he's away / out of country for days. When he arrives home, I greet him at the door with a smile and kiss (not because of the list above but because I want him to know I'm glad he's finally home). I DO offer him a drink. Sometimes it's just a coffee as he's flown all night and it's 0600 in the morning, and sometimes it's a nice cool glass of wine, and we enjoy it on the front porch together.</span></div><div><span style=\"color: #4f6d67;\"><br /></span></div><div><span style=\"color: #4f6d67;\">Do I HAVE to do all this?

Short answer: Yes</span></div><div><span style=\"color: #4f6d67;\"><br /></span></div><div><span style=\"color: #4f6d67;\">I truly want my husband to know that I treasure him. He is my best friend, lover and loved one. He was with me before we had children and he is by my side now that they are married and gone.

Choosing to follow Christ is one of them. I struggle daily with choices. Television programs are one of them. While I enjoy the creativity and inherent intelligence writers have, I find the content leaves a LOT to be desired. My family's favourite show, ending an eleven year run this month, is riddled with sexual content. When my husband asked why I didn't want to watch the program anymore, I said as much. He was surprised, until I sat with him and pointed out how every scene (rarely no exception) had implied or direct sexual innuendo. He truly had never thought about that. He just enjoyed the comedy.<br /><br />This is how the enemy sneaks behind our borders. It's fun. It's comedy. What harm is there in watching a show on TV. The sad truth is you become inured to the oily tentacles of sin. Who cares that everybody in that show is having sex outside of marriage, or all they are looking for is to 'hook up' with someone (for sex)? It's only a show, for crying out loud.<br /><br />We are to be set apart. We are to be the standard bearers for God. We are to shun all appearance of evil. We are to make hard choices.

A man of fortune, property, and good social standing, he is blissfully married to his wife, Elizabeth, and has a young son. With so much to live for, he is deeply shaken by a near fatal riding accident. Darcy miraculously escaped without injury, but soon he is visited by an otherworldly being, an Angel of Death, Graham. Graham compels Darcy to act as his guide for his sojourn in the world of mortals, and makes it clear that refusing would have dire consequences.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"background: white; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none;\"><br /></div><div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"background: white; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none;\"><span lang=\"EN\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">Darcy almost immediately begins to question Graham's true motives for choosing to stay at Pemberley. Can he trust Graham's assurance that no harm will come to his wife and child? Why does Graham insist on spending time with Elizabeth? How can Darcy possibly protect his family from an angel who has power over life and death? <o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"background: white; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none;\"><br /></div><div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"background: white; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none;\"><span lang=\"EN\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">In this romantic fantasy, the beloved couple from Jane Austen's <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">Pride and Prejudice</i> are forced to deal with both human and unearthly challenges.

Although considered by most a laconic sort, Darcy had discovered as a child that talking to horses benefitted both parties; the sound of his voice calmed the horses, and he was more comfortable talking with them than with people. He leaned forward in the saddle as he spoke, his mind focused upon his discourse. In listing to Regal the virtues of the notable equine specimens scheduled for delivery from the neighboring estate, he reaffirmed in his own mind that he had chosen well.</i></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none;\"><i style=\"font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;\">A cutting gust interrupted his thoughts with a pervasive discomfort, prompting him to raise the collar of his greatcoat and affirming his choice to take this particular route; the narrow, winding trail was a faster route to Pemberley than the road.</i></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none;\"><i style=\"font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;\">Because of circumstances beyond his control, he had been spending precious little time with his wife and child of late. His steward, Mr. Hughes, had resigned his position several weeks earlier, announcing his intention of marrying and relocating with his new wife in Scotland. Until he found the right person for that crucial post, he was forced to deal with a multitude of tasks his steward would customarily have handled.</i></blockquote><div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none;\"><span lang=\"EN\"><o:p><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">Oh dear, the next few paragraphs will place our dear Mr. Darcy in dire circumstances...</span></o:p></span></div><div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none;\"><span lang=\"EN\"><o:p><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">Congratulations Kelly.

With one sweeping glance Georgiana noted Lord George next to a radiant Kitty, and, on the couch across from them sat Mary, quiet as always.

In her mind\u2019s eye she pictured Lord George thundering down the lane on a white horse, snatching Kitty up and demanding she marry him.

Her breath hitched at the thought of Maxwell Kerr holding her in such a daring way. Maybe even closer than he had during their dance. Close enough for a kiss.

One of his tenants had become increasingly difficult, almost to the point where Max considered embarking on a trip to Yorkshire to deal with him personally. However, Mr. Mason was a very competent steward and he\u2019d had given him the latitude to deal with it as he saw fit, hoping they wouldn\u2019t be forced to evict a tenant whose family had been with the Kerr family for generations.</blockquote><div class=\"MsoNormal\"><o:p></o:p></div><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">At times like this, so far removed from Adborough Hall, he felt like he was losing control of his dukedom. But, there was no way to get around the fact he was required to be in the House of Lords, especially now with all the unrest in northern England. Important bills must be passed to ease the tensions, and that required him to remain in London and exert his considerable pressure on those who waffled in their votes. </blockquote><div class=\"MsoNormal\"><o:p></o:p></div><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">The letter completed, sanded and sealed, Max turned his attention to George\u2019s missive. He read the first few lines, then leaned back in his chair, letter still in his hand and smiled. George had proposed to Miss Catherine Bennet of Longbourn and she\u2019d accepted. Max continued reading and chuckled when George revealed that although he had a Special License, Catherine managed to convince him to wait for the banns to be read.</blockquote><div class=\"MsoNormal\"><o:p></o:p></div><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Good for Catherine, he thought. She had a will of steel, evidenced at Nathan\u2019s wedding last year when it was revealed that Viscount Stanhope had threatened her and she had protected George. Max wasn\u2019t sure of all the complete details, but George admitted he\u2019d been a spy for the Crown for over five years and because of Catherine\u2019s bravery, many lives of British agents in France had been safeguarded.</blockquote><div class=\"MsoNormal\"><o:p></o:p></div><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">How shocked everyone had been to discover Stanhope had been a traitor to England, and also, how fortuitous that the Honorable Colonel Fitzwilliam was in attendance to speak with the magistrate and keep the whole affair low key until after the wedding.</blockquote><div class=\"MsoNormal\"><o:p></o:p></div><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Fortunately for him, Nathan\u2019s wedding held far more pleasant recollections than vile stories of Viscount Stanhope and his treachery. His best memory, the one he brought to mind on an almost a daily basis, was his too brief of a dance with Miss Georgiana Darcy. Although not formally out in society, she\u2019d been allowed to partake in a few sets at Nathan\u2019s wedding ball because it had been held at Pemberley. For a half hour they\u2019d been able to converse without people leaning in to hear what they had to say. Or more specifically, what he had to say.</blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Their set had concluded far too soon for his liking and he\u2019d returned her safely to a watchful brother. This year she would make her curtsy and he planned to court her. Not in a brash manner like most of young bucks carried away not only by a pretty face but a handsome dowry. She was far too refined for a direct approach. No, he planned to woo her gently and like a lustrous pearl, coax her out of the shell of shyness. He\u2019d waited a long time for this. A few months would not matter.</blockquote><div class=\"MsoNormal\"><o:p></o:p></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NgPbIaeLv0c/W4XehbXT76I/AAAAAAAADu8/cPLObZ1Q7mEJ2hrrgp8fuk-UZ5oqbzkzgCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Always%2BWith%2BLove.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"100\" data-original-width=\"265\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NgPbIaeLv0c/W4XehbXT76I/AAAAAAAADu8/cPLObZ1Q7mEJ2hrrgp8fuk-UZ5oqbzkzgCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Always%2BWith%2BLove.png\" /></a></div><br />Sue Barrhttp://www.blogger.com/profile/06347249118943488564noreply@blogger.com0tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8317810105915057272.post-24133329267342639732019-04-26T05:00:00.000-04:002019-04-26T05:00:07.566-04:00First Page Friday - Guest - Diane CHARTRAND<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-u9kc7ZUhM5Q/XJjhs6Kd2HI/AAAAAAAAEBw/MNmFgoh3m8gix-aIhyQRIbsF0GA1v4F6wCLcBGAs/s1600/FPF%2BDC%2BBlog.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"200\" data-original-width=\"800\" height=\"160\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-u9kc7ZUhM5Q/XJjhs6Kd2HI/AAAAAAAAEBw/MNmFgoh3m8gix-aIhyQRIbsF0GA1v4F6wCLcBGAs/s640/FPF%2BDC%2BBlog.png\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><br />Welcome Diane Chartrand to First Page Friday.

I will not be showing these as chapters as sometimes I might not post the full chapter, only a portion.<br /><br />Without further ado - Georgiana ~ Part One<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-rzTbZWfrxCs/XMCIyxGUkVI/AAAAAAAAED8/VQX8YVAw5es2gj9COx2932y13WpyG5YXACLcBGAs/s1600/Georgiana%2B-%2Bserialized.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"265\" data-original-width=\"805\" height=\"209\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-rzTbZWfrxCs/XMCIyxGUkVI/AAAAAAAAED8/VQX8YVAw5es2gj9COx2932y13WpyG5YXACLcBGAs/s640/Georgiana%2B-%2Bserialized.png\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; text-indent: 0in;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">The carriage with its three occupants bumped along the narrow road. At the sound of glass against glass Georgiana Darcy spared her maid, who clutched a basket of preserves on her lap, a glance. The trail, although rough in some places due to the spring storm which had trundled through Derbyshire last week, had dried out enough so that Georgiana could visit some long-term tenants before departing for London. The thought of leaving Pemberley and all that was familiar, in order to prepare for her first Season, caused her stomach to clench. She knew the fear and shyness was irrational, but the thought of meeting so many new people almost made her sick.</span></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; text-indent: 0in;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">\"Are you quite all right, Miss Darcy?\"</span></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; text-indent: 0in;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">The polite inquiry came from Lord Nathan, better known as Mr. Kerr to the parishioners of Kympton parish. His curly dark hair, broad shoulders and ready smile caused many a young lady to wish he belonged to her but he had no eyes other than for his wife, the former Miss Caroline Bingley.</span></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; text-indent: 0in;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">\u201cI am well, Lord Nathan, thank you.\u201d</span></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; text-indent: 0in;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">As attractive as Lord Nathan was, he didn\u2019t make her heart race. No, that pesky organ only galloped along like a new colt around the vicar\u2019s brother, Maxwell Kerr, the fifth Duke of Adborough. Try as she might, no amount of internal scolding changed how she felt around him.</span></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; text-indent: 0in;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">They hit another bump and her maid straightened her straw bonnet.</span></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; text-indent: 0in;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">\u201cOnly one more mile, Anna,\u201d Georgiana said with a smile.</span></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; text-indent: 0in;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">She returned her gaze to the passing scenery. The rolling grounds of Pemberley\u2019s estate. In a few short weeks all this would become a memory. If all went as planned, she\u2019d make her debut, meet a suitable gentleman, fall in love and get married.</span></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; text-indent: 0in;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">Her stomach clenched again.</span></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; text-indent: 0in;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">I have nothing to be afraid of. No one knows about my mistake.</i></span></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; text-indent: 0in;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">How she longed to capture the carefree girl she\u2019d been before that fateful summer four years ago. Elizabeth, her sister-by-love, cautioned her to move on and forgive herself as she\u2019d been only five and ten at the time, but no one seemed to understand that she\u2019d been more than prepared to become a wife and mother regardless of her age. They all believed her to be a silly girl who\u2019d become caught up in the moment. He\u2019d been a familiar face in a sea of new ones and his ultimate betrayal of her affection cut deep.</span></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; text-indent: 0in;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">She bit back a small sigh and raised her chin, thankful she no longer held a tendr\u00e9 for&nbsp;<i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">him</i>. That notion had been ruthlessly squashed when she overheard a conversation between him and&nbsp;her brother immediately following their discovery. He informed Fitzwilliam, in a condescending manner, that he\u2019d pursued her solely for monetary gain as no man wanted such a dull flower for a wife. The utter contempt in his tone made her cringe and hang her head in shame.</span></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; text-indent: 0in;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">\u201cYou seem rather melancholy, Miss Darcy.\u201d Lord Nathan broke into her thoughts. \u201cAre you sure you are up to visiting the Sprague family today?\u201d</span></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; text-indent: 0in;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">\u201cI am well, truly.\u201d She smiled to reassure him. \u201cI have been contemplating Pemberley and how much I shall miss it.\u201d</span></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; text-indent: 0in;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">\u201cAh.\u201d The quiet assessment in Lord Nathan\u2019s eyes told her he doubted the veracity of her statement but wisely kept his counsel. \u201cI see we have arrived.\u201d</span></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; text-indent: 0in;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">The carriage slowed to a stop in front of a small cottage. Lazy smoke drifted from the chimney and pretty rosebushes lined the walk leading to the front door, which opened as soon as they alighted from the carriage.</span></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; text-indent: 0in;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">\u201cMiss Darcy, Mr. Kerr. What an unexpected surprise.\u201d A rosy faced woman hurried from the cottage and gave them each a small curtsy.</span></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; text-indent: 0in;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">\u201cI brought a few things from Pemberley. Mrs. Reynolds heard how Johnny was feeling poorly and she knows how much he likes peach preserves. There is also some venison and a few cakes.\u201d</span></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; text-indent: 0in;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">\u201cOh, bless her heart, he most certainly does love her preserves.\u201d Mrs. Sprague hurried forward and took the basket from Anna, then turned toward the cottage. \u201cWhere are my manners? Come in and I\u2019ll make tea.\u201d</span></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; text-indent: 0in;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">The cottage, though small, was as neat as a pin. Mrs. Sprague took pride in her home and the time spent in her company passed quickly. The physician had been to see Johnny and although still was weak from the fever\u2019s lingering effect, he\u2019d rallied enough to sit by the fire and enjoy his tea with them all. About to take their leave, Mrs. Sprague pressed a small token into Georgiana\u2019s hand.</span></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; text-indent: 0in;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp;</span>\u201cMy Henry carved this when he heard you were going to London.\u201d Georgiana looked down at the exquisite cross. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep you in our prayers, Miss Darcy, that God will guide your steps to a good man worthy of your regard.\u201d</span></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; text-indent: 0in;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">\u201cThank you, Mrs. Sprague.\u201d Unbidden tears sprang into her eyes. \u201cI shall treasure this, always.\u201d</span></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; text-indent: 0in;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">\u201cYou just remember to seek the Lord with all your heart and He will guide your path. That verse has kept me and Henry all these years and I like to think the Almighty knows what He\u2019s about.\u201d</span></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; text-indent: 0in;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">\u201cThat He does, Mrs. Sprague,\u201d Lord Nathan said. \u201cYour prayers are always much appreciated. Good day.\u201d He tipped his hat in respect and Mrs. Sprague gave them both a polite curtsy.</span></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; text-indent: 0in;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">\u201cGood day, Mrs. Sprague.\u201d Georgiana joined Lord Nathan at the carriage. After handing her up, he climbed in and sat across from her and Sarah.</span></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; text-indent: 0in;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">\u201cThat was a thoughtful gift.\u201d</span></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; text-indent: 0in;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">\u201cOh, yes.\u201d She opened her hand and studied the cross again. \u201cMr. Sprague is a talented carver.\u201d</span></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; text-indent: 0in;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">The carriage started off with a jolt and Anna squeaked in surprise. The sound was so unexpected, Georgiana began to giggle. The more she tried to stop, the harder she laughed. Soon Lord Nathan smiled broadly and chuckled. Anna, her face red with embarrassment, apologized profusely for having cried out.</span></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; text-indent: 0in;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">\u201cOh, Anna, you sounded like a little field mouse. That was such fun.\u201d She wiped tears of laughter from the corner of her eyes. \u201cI have not laughed that hard in such a long time.\u201d</span></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; text-indent: 0in;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">\u201cI\u2019m glad to be of service, Miss Darcy.\u201d</span></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; text-indent: 0in;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">Her prim response set off more peals of laughter from Georgiana and this time, even Anna joined in. All Lord Nathan did was shake his head.</span></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; text-indent: 0in;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">\u201cI am sorry, Lord Nathan. You must think us extremely silly.\u201d</span></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; text-indent: 0in;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">\u201cNot at all,\u201d he gallantly replied. \u201cIt has been a long time since I heard you laugh, Miss Darcy. This past year has been good for you. Having Elizabeth\u2019s sister keep you company this past winter brought out the fun-loving girl I and my brother\u2019s all remember from our youth.\u201d</span></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; text-indent: 0in;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">\u201cTrue, Mary was surprisingly lively and we both shared a love of music. I recall when we first met she rarely smiled. How I wish she would come to London with me for my debut.\u201d</span></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; text-indent: 0in;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">\u201cYou know she is not one for fancy parties and large crowds.\u201d</span></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; text-indent: 0in;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">\u201cI do know that, but she offers a most sardonic narration of the guests and what makes the commentary so funny is that she does not mean to be satirical. She is only giving an honest opinion and it is so refreshing.\u201d Georgiana leaned forward. \u201cShe told me during one of our morning visits in London,\u201d she choked back a giggle, \u201cthat Lady Fitzherbert\u2019s hat looked like a peacock had nested upon her head. I had to leave the room before I laughed out loud, but it was true!\u201d</span></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; text-indent: 0in;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">\u201cPoor Lady Fitzherbert.\u201d Lord Nathan smiled in remembrance. \u201cI am afraid her milliner informed her peacock feathers were all the rage and, well, she became quite enthusiastic about the whole ensemble.\u201d</span></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; text-indent: 0in;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">\u201cFortunately, everybody loves Lady Fitzherbert. This fashion faux pas will be overlooked because she gives so much of herself to those who need help.\u201d The carriage slowed to a stop and Lord Nathan alighted. He turned and gave both women a polite nod. \u201cTell your brother I shall be over in a few days to discuss the new vicar for Kympton.\u201d</span></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; text-indent: 0in;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">\u201cI will. Give my regards to Caroline.\u201d</span></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; text-indent: 0in;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">\u201cI shall. She misses your company.\u201d</span></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; text-indent: 0in;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">For three months, during Fitz and Lizzy\u2019s wedding trip, Caroline resided at Pemberley. Lord Nathan, her betrothed at the time, became a frequent visitor and Georgiana had watched their love deepen and grow. She hoped \u2013 no, she prayed \u2013 to find a love like that.</span></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; text-indent: 0in;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">At one time she thought his brother the Duke might make an offer. He\u2019d shown an uncommon interest in her each time he visited Pemberley. And, at Lord Nathan and Caroline\u2019s pre-wedding ball they\u2019d danced and it was as though she\u2019d come home. The music was secondary to the feel of his strong arm around her waist, his lean fingers holding her hand. Even though she\u2019d worn silk gloves, her skin burned as though he\u2019d physically touched her with fire.</span></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; text-indent: 0in;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">After the dizzying euphoria of the dance he\u2019d bowed politely and returned her to her brother\u2019s side. The next morning she discovered he\u2019d left for London and she hadn\u2019t seen him since.</span></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; text-indent: 0in;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">She\u2019d held onto a tenuous hope of him visiting again, but as weeks turned into months the harsh reality of his disinterest set in. She had no choice but to make a concerted effort to seek a husband from another quarter. And for that very reason, her curtsy and debut loomed before her like an executioner\u2019s block. She did not do well with strangers. Her thoughts and tongue didn\u2019t stay in harmony when she became nervous. It was as though she played Mozart with her left hand and Beethoven with her right. Discordant and confusing.</span></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; text-indent: 0in;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">Aunt Lucinda, the Countess of Matlock, would have an apoplectic fit if she knew where her niece\u2019s thoughts were headed. She anticipated Georgiana making a brilliant marriage, as did the whole Matlock/Darcy family. The invisible bonds of duty and family honor continued to spiral around Georgiana\u2019s future and at times she felt as though they choked the very life out of her.</span></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; text-indent: 0in;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">Her attention was drawn to the graveled drive leading up to Kympton Parish courtyard. A horse and ride thundered down the lane and pulled to stop beside their carriage. He dismounted in haste and approached Lord Nathan.</span></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; text-indent: 0in;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">\u201cSir, I am looking for Lord Nathan Kerr.\u201d </span></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; text-indent: 0in;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">\u201cI am Lord Nathan Kerr.\u201d Nathan met the man who handed him a sealed letter. \u201cThank you. See my housekeeper for payment.\u201d</span></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; text-indent: 0in;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">\u201cNot required, my lord.

(did I say old?) friend. Suzan and I go WAY back. Most of our joint memories revolve around high school, but we both attended the same church in our small town so I have an inkling we knew each other as wee little girls in Sunday School. Suzan was a year older than me, and when you're at an age where you insist on everyone knowing you are eight and a HALF, one year is a big difference. However, by the time I was in Grade Nine and she in Grade Ten, a solid friendship had begun.<br /><br />Through the magic of Facebook, (which <span style=\"font-family: &quot;georgia&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;\"><i>can </i></span>be used for good), we re-connected. In fact, it was Suzan who introduced me to #JAFF. I had read some fan fiction years before, (Pamela Aiden's Fitzwilliam Darcy - Gentleman trilogy), but never knew there was a whole genre revolving specifically around Jane Austen's characters. I felt like I'd come home when I began to peek around A Happy Assembly.<br /><br />Today, Suzan is sharing from her latest novel, <span style=\"font-family: &quot;georgia&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;\"><i>The Mist of Her Memory</i></span><br /><br /><b>Book Blurb:</b><br /><span style=\"font-family: inherit; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-family: inherit; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Sequestered in her Aunt and Uncle Gardiner\u2019s London home, Elizabeth Bennet is recovering from an incident that stole her memories. She still suffers strange, angry voices in her head and recalls events people tell her never happened\u2014even those who love her don\u2019t believe her. Elizabeth can barely stand it!</span><br /><span style=\"font-family: inherit; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-family: inherit; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Mr. Darcy\u2019s longs for any hint of his beloved\u2019s well-being, yet he lacks the information he so desperately seeks because he has been forbidden contact with Elizabeth.

She had seen a cloak of sorts hanging in the back entrance as she wandered up and down stairs whilst her aunt made calls in the mornings. On those days, they did not walk in the park, and her aunt refused to allow Elizabeth to take her walks on her own. Could they not understand how valuable her exercise and time outside of the stale air of the house were to her? She would be perfectly safe\u2014she had never fallen faint on her own.</span></span></blockquote><br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 36pt; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><span style=\"font-family: &quot;georgia&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;\">But as much as she tried to stay out of the servants\u2019 way on the days when she ambled about the house for exercise, her presence here had been reported at some point.

The drab, homespun servant\u2019s cape made her skin itch whenever she imagined wearing it, yet the pathetic garment was a symbol of hope\u2014if she dared fetch it.

Someone needed to make an offer.</span></span></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; text-indent: 0in;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"><span style=\"font-family: &quot;georgia&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;\">If anyone were to catalog all her attributes, they\u2019d wonder how she\u2019d gone so long without one single proposal. Without one single kiss. She didn\u2019t count the quick peck the cobbler\u2019s son gave her behind the church when she was fourteen.

Indeed, knowing the lady's true feelings for him, he makes every effort to see that they do not.

From the outset, he had dreaded this journey. Indeed, if it were up to him, he would not have come within fifty miles of Hunsford for as long as he lived. But despite the accusations leveled at him in that very village, Darcy was a man who knew his duty, so when Lady Catherine had requested\u2014nay, demanded\u2014his assistance, he had come. Even so, he kept his visit as brief as possible, arriving yesterday morning and working late into the night. He spoke to no one, save his aunt\u2019s steward, going so far as to take meals in his chambers. And not his usual chambers, either. No, he had made a point of requesting a different apartment. Never again would he step foot in the room where he had dared to dream of a life spent happily with Miss Elizabeth Bennet. The room where he had poured out his soul in that ill-conceived letter\u2026</i></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in; mso-pagination: none;\"><i style=\"font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 0.2in;\">Releasing a rough sigh, Darcy pressed his forehead to the cold glass.

After leaving Rosings, he had gone straight to London to set things right with Bingley, and then there was Wickham to contend with. That endeavor had proven a bit more challenging, but at least it had kept Darcy from dwelling on his disappointed hopes. By mid-summer he was back at Pemberley, and though he made every effort to throw himself into the management of his estate, even the brandy he had taken to consuming on a nightly basis did little to dull his memories. For no matter what he did, Elizabeth Bennet haunted his dreams, both sleeping and awake. Sometimes she would appear to him the way he wished to remember her\u2014her smile radiant, her expression bright with humor.

I, myself, have pondered often how Darcy behaved in the months between Hunsford and the fateful meeting with Miss Elizabeth Bennet. Some of my favourite stories revolve around his quest to become a more 'gentlemanlike' person. I enjoyed this story very much and hope you do as well.<br /><br />You can find out more about Jennifer and her book on her <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/JAltmanAuthor/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook Page</a>.

Today, Rianna is sharing from her Pride and Prejudice variation novel:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mybook.to/ThroughaDifferentLens\" style=\"font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;\" target=\"_blank\">Through a Different Lens</a><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">. I don't know about you, but I love reading stories of Darcy and Elizabeth. There's something about an enemy to friend trope that takes hold of your imagination. Regardless of how many stories I read, I never tire of them. Without further ado, here is more details about Riana's book.</span><br /><br /><b>Book Blurb:</b><br /><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"background: white; color: #333333;\">A tale of second glances and second chances</span><span style=\"color: #333333;\"><br /><br /><span style=\"background: white;\">Elizabeth Bennet has disliked the aloof and arrogant Mr. Darcy since he insulted her at a village dance several months before. But an unexpected conversation with a startling turn of phrase suddenly causes her to reassess everything she thought she knew about the infuriating and humourless gentleman.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style=\"background: white;\">Elizabeth knows something of people who think differently. Her young cousin in London has always been different from his siblings and peers, and Lizzy sees something of this boy\u2019s unusual traits in the stern gentleman from Derbyshire whose presence has plagued her for so long. She approaches him in friendship and the two begin a tentative association. But is Lizzy's new understanding of Mr. Darcy accurate? Or was she right the first time? And will the unwelcome appearance of a nemesis from the past destroy any hopes they might have of happiness?</span><br /><br /><span style=\"background: white;\">Warning: This variation of Jane Austen's classic Pride and Prejudice depicts our hero as having a neurological difference. If you need your hero to be perfect, this might not be the book for you. But if you like adorable children, annoying birds, and wonderful dogs, and are open to a character who struggles to make his way in a world he does not quite comprehend, with a heroine who can see the man behind his challenges, and who celebrates his strengths while supporting his weaknesses, then read on! You, too, can learn what wonders can be found when we see the familiar through a different lens.</span></span></span><br /><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"color: #333333;\"><span style=\"background: white;\"><br /></span></span></span><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"color: #333333;\"><span style=\"background: white;\"><b>First Page:</b></span></span></span><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-family: &quot;georgia&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif; font-size: large;\"><span style=\"color: #333333;\"><span style=\"background: white;\"><i>Chapter One</i></span></span></span></div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-family: &quot;georgia&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif; font-size: large;\"><span style=\"color: #333333;\"><span style=\"background: white;\"><i>Ill Qualified to Recommend Himself</i></span></span></span></div><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><span style=\"color: #333333;\"><span style=\"background: white;\"><i><span style=\"font-family: &quot;georgia&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;\">It was an evening much like many others over the past few weeks. The small party were gathered in the salon after an uncomfortable dinner, to amuse, delight, and take advice from the doyenne of the house. The meal had seemed endless, with one overly fine dish superseding another, testimony more to the expense of a fine French chef than to the consideration due to the palates of the assembled guests. Likewise, the conversation, more of a series of interrogatory demands by the lady of the house than an exchange of light and pleasant thoughts to lend enjoyment to the meal. Now, the last of the dishes cleared away and the company retired to the salon, Elizabeth sat perched upon the uncomfortable sofa, seeking something amusing to say that would astound those gathered around. Beside her sat her dear Charlotte, whom she was visiting, and nearby, Charlotte's husband, Mr. Collins, who held the living at Hunsford, adjacent to the grand manor house of Rosings. Also in the room were the mistress of the house herself, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, domineering and fierce of temperament, her sickly daughter Anne, who seemed more intimidated than truly ill, Anne's companion Mrs. Jenkins, and Charlotte's timid sister Maria, who hardly spoke a word.</span></i></span></span></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><span style=\"color: #333333;\"><span style=\"background: white;\"><i><span style=\"font-family: &quot;georgia&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;\">In all of these particulars, the scene had been repeated many times since Elizabeth first arrived at Hunsford for a prolonged visit with her friend; recently, however, two more members had joined their party, one adding to its pleasure, the other to its awkwardness.</span></i></span></span></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><span style=\"background: white;\"><i><span style=\"font-family: &quot;georgia&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;\"><span style=\"color: #333333;\">The increased pleasure was due entirely to the newly formed </span><span style=\"color: #333333;\">acquaintance</span><span style=\"color: #333333;\">&nbsp;with Lady Catherine's nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, on a short leave from the army to visit his aunt and cousin and help tend to affairs of her estate. The colonel and Elizabeth had quickly formed a comfortable and easy friendship, for the gentleman was intelligent, quick-witted, and extremely good company. Elizabeth had taken an immediate liking to him and was pleased when he sought her companionship, either in the salon or whilst walking through the park.</span></span></i></span></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><span style=\"background: white;\"><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: &quot;georgia&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;\"><i>His friend, however, was a far less of a source of pleasure. Silent, stiff and brooding, the colonel's constant shadow was none other than Mr. Darcy, whom Elizabeth had come to know and rather dislike several months ago at her home in Hertfordshire, near the village of Meryton.</i></span></span></blockquote><span style=\"background: white;\"><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: inherit;\">There you have it, dear reader. Mr. Darcy is still looked upon unfavorable by Miss Elizabeth Bennet. (Sigh) He really was quite the dunderhead, wasn't he? I'm hoping Ms. Everly will take us on a wild ride with enough twists and turns to satisfy our angst ridden desires.</span></span><br /><span style=\"background: white;\"><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: inherit;\"><br /></span></span><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"background: white;\"><b style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><span style=\"background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-size: initial; color: #333333;\"><a href=\"https://rianaeverly.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color: #333333;\"><span style=\"background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-size: initial;\"><a href=\"https://rianaeverly.com/blog/\" target=\"_blank\">Blog</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;</span></span><span style=\"color: #333333;\"><span style=\"background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-size: initial;\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/RianaEverly/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;</span></span><span style=\"color: #333333;\"><span style=\"background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-size: initial;\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/RianaEverly\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;</span></span><span style=\"color: #333333;\"><span style=\"background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-size: initial;\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Riana-Everly/e/B076C6HY27\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a></span></span></b></span></div><span style=\"background: white;\"><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: inherit;\"><br /></span></span><span style=\"background: white;\"><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: inherit;\">Learn more about Riana by clinking on the links shown above.

While Jane had acquiesced to Mr. Collins\u2019s request with forbearance, Elizabeth had no idea that her sister truly meant to accept him, and was shocked when Mrs. Bennet fluttered into the drawing room less than an hour later, rejoicing over their good fortune.

Locate missing socialite Harrison Grant. To complicate matters, her estranged husband lands on her doorstep. He's also on the hunt for Harrison, albeit for a completely different reason. Harry is the prime suspect in the grisly murder of a call girl in L.A.<br /><br />Agent Jake Steele, aka Tank, is deep undercover as a P.I., and sometimes there's collateral damage in his line of work. His marriage to Shelby is one of them. With her life in danger, he lets her think he left for another woman. When this case is over, he means to win back the heart and trust of Shelby, the only woman he's ever loved.<br /><br />However, there's another person who has their eye on Shelby and will stop at nothing to possess her.<br /><br />From an attempted kidnapping to an explosion with deadly consequences, this is not your average missing person's case.<br /><br /><b><span style=\"font-size: large;\">First Page:</span></b><br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"line-height: normal; text-indent: 0in;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"><span style=\"font-family: &quot;georgia&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;\"><i>A hint of rain lingered in the air without breaking the stifling heat.

It's just not what we do. I think it's because we say 'I love you' every day. The only exception being when he's away on a trip, and even then he usually FaceTime's me, or sends a text.<br /><br />With hubby having served in the military and being away (anywhere from three weeks to months at at time, AND losing many, many friends during that time) we make sure to always say I love you. You truly do not know from one minute to the next if you will still walk this earth.<br /><br />The biggest tragedy we faced was in 1985 when two Hercules crashed mid-air. We lost ten friends in a split second. The part that sent shivers running up and down my spine was the fact hubby was invited to join them. It was a three plane formation (rare for Herc's), but he'd just returned from a search and rescue mission and was bagged. All he wanted to do was go home and catch some zzzzz's. Other friends and family were not so lucky.<br /><br />This is why every day is Valentine's day in our house and why I urge you to always hug someone you love. You just don't know...<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-DIupFlFVFEk/XGbHZU7jfII/AAAAAAAAD9c/-JymmZ1RF4Q79z0nIT53pAifdI0M2WkcQCLcBGAs/s1600/Valentine.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"800\" data-original-width=\"800\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-DIupFlFVFEk/XGbHZU7jfII/AAAAAAAAD9c/-JymmZ1RF4Q79z0nIT53pAifdI0M2WkcQCLcBGAs/s640/Valentine.png\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NgPbIaeLv0c/W4XehbXT76I/AAAAAAAADu8/cPLObZ1Q7mEJ2hrrgp8fuk-UZ5oqbzkzgCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Always%2BWith%2BLove.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"100\" data-original-width=\"265\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NgPbIaeLv0c/W4XehbXT76I/AAAAAAAADu8/cPLObZ1Q7mEJ2hrrgp8fuk-UZ5oqbzkzgCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Always%2BWith%2BLove.png\" /></a></div>P.S.: Hug someone you love today....Sue Barrhttp://www.blogger.com/profile/06347249118943488564noreply@blogger.com0tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8317810105915057272.post-32864563267530376432019-02-09T05:00:00.000-05:002019-05-05T12:47:30.645-04:00WEEKEND WRITING WARRIORS #69<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vJ4jS8JPBrY/WqVAJzFXvjI/AAAAAAAADaA/q0BqnY24_ZEme-A-zSEgoUBqZGd0WvFVgCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/wewriwa2.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"210\" data-original-width=\"676\" height=\"196\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vJ4jS8JPBrY/WqVAJzFXvjI/AAAAAAAADaA/q0BqnY24_ZEme-A-zSEgoUBqZGd0WvFVgCPcBGAYYCw/s640/wewriwa2.png\" width=\"640\" /></a></div>What a week!

Hand in hand with grace walks mercy. Mercy means you do not get the punishment you deserve. God is abundant in grace and mercy and we can read all about it in the Bible. I'm going to share one verse and also a video of Matt Redman singing his song, \"Your Grace Finds Me\".<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><span style=\"font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;\"><i>Therefore, since we have been made righteous by faith, we have peace with God through Lord Y'Shua Messiah also through Whom we have had access by faith into this <b>grace</b> in which we stand and boast in hope of the glory of God.</i></span></blockquote><div style=\"text-align: right;\">Romans 5: 1-2<br /><br /></div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mqd8MoiCbcI\" width=\"560\"></iframe><br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NgPbIaeLv0c/W4XehbXT76I/AAAAAAAADu8/cPLObZ1Q7mEJ2hrrgp8fuk-UZ5oqbzkzgCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Always%2BWith%2BLove.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"100\" data-original-width=\"265\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NgPbIaeLv0c/W4XehbXT76I/AAAAAAAADu8/cPLObZ1Q7mEJ2hrrgp8fuk-UZ5oqbzkzgCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Always%2BWith%2BLove.png\" /></a></div><br /></div>Sue Barrhttp://www.blogger.com/profile/06347249118943488564noreply@blogger.com0tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8317810105915057272.post-17444059867051876842019-02-04T11:36:00.000-05:002019-05-05T12:05:01.038-04:00I Won An Award!I received the loveliest surprise this morning in my e-mail. I won the Jane Austen Reader's Bi-Monthly award for my book <span style=\"font-family: &quot;georgia&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;\"><i>CAROLINE</i></span>.<br /><br />I was quite worried about my entry because most Janeites absolutely HATE Caroline Bingley and have a hard time reconciling their minds around her having a change of character and heart. Thank you to Charlotte Bream and her team for choosing my book.<br /><br />Here is the review, link to the blog site added on the bottom if you wish to verify and/or check out this blog for other books and recommendations.<br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-family: &quot;georgia&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif; font-size: large;\"><b>Editorial Review</b></span></div><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><i style=\"font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;\">A poignant tale of Caroline Bingley's struggle to overcome Mr. Darcy's rebuttal of her affections, and his eventual wedlock to Miss Elizabeth Bennet unfolds. With a hard lesson learned for the young lady with a scissor sharp tongue, Caroline is forced to consider her future. A bleak picture emerges, and while she must at all costs be present at Darcy's wedding, she did not foresee Pemberley as the prime venue for the wedding breakfast. With stoicism Caroline strives to impress on the Misses Elizabeth and Jane Bennet, she no longer bears hard feelings toward either of them. All the while she remains embittered in belief her life is in tatters and her heart shredded by Darcy. Quite oblivious to another gentleman who views her as Darcy never has, Caroline is soon faced with a dilemma. Totally unaware the thrill of the chase excites her admirer she finds him exhilarating company. He is what he is at heart while somewhat reformed in character. To her chagrin he becomes her salvation and mentor in may respects. Soon a Caroline she never new existed emerges from the dark shadow of all she had despised about herself. Hence envy, heartache, gratitude and love, is blended with the skill of excellent prose and solid pot. And within the pictorial splendour of the Pemberley Estate is where a happy ever after for Caroline is realized. Therefore, the Jane Austen Award is hereby bestowed to Sue Barr for Caroline: a P&amp;P Continuation.</i></blockquote><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4TEewqRMveM/XFho-Ic_utI/AAAAAAAAD8o/d0C-MRx0J0A0z_IK0NzpM6BV8m2fT2CLwCLcBGAs/s1600/JaneAustenAward.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"342\" data-original-width=\"277\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4TEewqRMveM/XFho-Ic_utI/AAAAAAAAD8o/d0C-MRx0J0A0z_IK0NzpM6BV8m2fT2CLwCLcBGAs/s320/JaneAustenAward.png\" width=\"259\" /></a></div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://janeaustenreadersaward.blogspot.com/2019/02/latest-jane-austen-awardregency-award.html\" target=\"_blank\">Jane Austen Reader's Award Blog</a></div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><br /></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NgPbIaeLv0c/W4XehbXT76I/AAAAAAAADu8/cPLObZ1Q7mEJ2hrrgp8fuk-UZ5oqbzkzgCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Always%2BWith%2BLove.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"100\" data-original-width=\"265\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NgPbIaeLv0c/W4XehbXT76I/AAAAAAAADu8/cPLObZ1Q7mEJ2hrrgp8fuk-UZ5oqbzkzgCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Always%2BWith%2BLove.png\" /></a></div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><br /></div>Sue Barrhttp://www.blogger.com/profile/06347249118943488564noreply@blogger.com0tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8317810105915057272.post-83803379729643192482019-02-02T05:00:00.000-05:002019-05-05T12:47:03.043-04:00WEEKEND WRITING WARRIORS #68<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vJ4jS8JPBrY/WqVAJzFXvjI/AAAAAAAADaA/q0BqnY24_ZEme-A-zSEgoUBqZGd0WvFVgCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/wewriwa2.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"210\" data-original-width=\"676\" height=\"196\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vJ4jS8JPBrY/WqVAJzFXvjI/AAAAAAAADaA/q0BqnY24_ZEme-A-zSEgoUBqZGd0WvFVgCPcBGAYYCw/s640/wewriwa2.png\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><br />Hello fellow Warriors. I'm back. My health is a bit dodgy, but I'm still kickin' and causing dear hubby tons of grief. Surgery looms in my future, date yet to be determined. Other than that, this past week saw me refresh my memory banks about where I was in my two stories (Georgiana and Mary). This led to the inevitable editing I do whenever I read my prose. I've never figured out how to shut the internal editor off, and I'm coming to the conclusion that a HUGE portion of Georgiana is going to drift onto the cutting floor. I can't seem to get past the last scene and that means - Cut the little darlings. *Ouch*<br /><br />As I struggled with Georgiana, this lovely scene popped into my head and it doesn't suit sweet Miss Darcy. This snippet, from my future <span style=\"font-family: &quot;georgia&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;\"><i><b>ONLY A ROGUE WILL DO</b></i></span>, is here for your perusal.<br /><br />It's so fresh, I haven't transferred it from the notebook I keep by my bed.<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><span style=\"font-family: &quot;georgia&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;\"><i>He plucked the dance card from her fingers and before she could protest, opened the tiny booklet and began to read the names she'd scribbled down before entering the ball room.</i></span></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><span style=\"font-family: &quot;georgia&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;\"><i>\"Hmmm... Baron Bootstrap... Lord Runamuk...\" he murmured, his lips tilting into a grin. \"I see Sir Trapdoor didn't make his dance, poor soul, do you believe he... fell through something?\"</i></span></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><span style=\"font-family: &quot;georgia&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;\"><i>\"Sometimes I think I absolutely hate you.\"&nbsp;</i></span><i style=\"font-family: georgia, &quot;times new roman&quot;, serif;\">She snatched the card out of his hand and tucked it into her reticule. Before she could turn and escape his all knowing gaze and self-important gloating, he touched her arm and stayed her movement.</i></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><span style=\"font-family: &quot;georgia&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;\"><i>\"Forgive me, I have no right to make fun of how you deal with this. May I please see the card again.\"</i></span></blockquote><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><span style=\"font-family: &quot;georgia&quot; , &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;\"><i>She almost shook off his hand, but something in his eyes - compassion, perhaps? - had her reach into her bag and hand him the card. He promptly borrowed a pen from Miss ______, standing nearby, and wrote his name next to the supper set.</i></span></blockquote>I like these two already.<br /><br />To view the work of other authors participating in this weekly writing exercise, please click <a href=\"http://www.wewriwa.com/\" target=\"_blank\">HERE</a>.
