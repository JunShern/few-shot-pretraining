Please Pass It On!\n\nThis is part of my dad's collection of rare music-related objects. From my dad's old blog: \"They were made in 1859 by Barbedienne in Paris. They have been authenticated by two Liszt experts who were able to match elements like distinctive webbing and a small mole on the fourth finger of the right hand which were known features of Liszt hands. As far as we know they are one of a kind as the Liszt museum in Budapest has only a plaster cast of a single hand made very late in the life of the composer. We have yet to find similar examples. We bought them from a very elderly pianist in Manhattan (name withheld) who claimed the hands were originally owned by Arthur Friedheim though she refused to say how they came to her family--only that her mother and Friedman had been \"very close\".\n\nJust back from 2 Liszt Museums. One in Bayreuth and one in Weimar, Germany. Both very interesting. I believe both museums had a single hand cast in plaster. I remember holding my hand up to the one in the case for comparison. Did not see bronze casts though. We we allowed to play a Liszt grand in Bayreuth.\n\n_________________________\n\"Music gives a soul to the universe, wings to the mind, flight to the imagination, and life to everything.\"\n\nRostosky\n3000 Post Club Member\nRegistered: 04/30/11\nPosts: 3339\nLoc: Lost in cyberspace.in the UK.\n\nWow what a stunning find, If they are totally authentic, then it appears that so far anyways you do have a \"one off\" and as such could litterally ask what ever you want for them, at the absolute minimum, you can get the Piano of your dreams from these hands..And how fitting would that be?Liszts hands provide First class top notch Piano (He would be totally proud of this)And Liszts hands get to be in museum where they belong for the public to see.\n\nThis is a staggeringly important find, I am green with envy.\n\n_________________________\n\nRise like lions after slumber,in unvanquishable number.

I defer to mrs Rossy and her Archeological training, she is now comparing the plaster cast with the bronze for interest!\n\nWhatever you do, do not polish them!\n\n_________________________\n\nRise like lions after slumber,in unvanquishable number.
