    "text": "Background\n==========\n\nPapaya mosaic virus (PapMV) is a member of the large family of *Flexiviridae* in the genus *Potexvirus*. The virus has a flexuous rod shape of 500\u2009nm in length and 13\u2009nm in diameter \\[[@B1]\\]. The CP, made mostly of alpha helices \\[[@B2]\\], is composed of 215 amino acids and has an estimated molecular weight of 23\u2009kDa \\[[@B3]\\]. We showed previously that non-infectious nanoparticles made of recombinant PapMV CP are similar in shape and appearance to wild-type virus purified from plants \\[[@B3]\\]. PapMV nanoparticles were used previously as a vaccine platform technology to improve the immunogenicity of a peptide antigen fused to the nanoparticle structure \\[[@B4]-[@B8]\\]. The PapMV vaccine platform can induce a long-lasting memory response to an antigen fused on its surface \\[[@B4]\\]. Previous studies showed the capacity of PapMV nanoparticles to trigger a CTL response, in both *in vitro* and *in vivo* models, when the CTL epitope was fused to the C-terminus of the CP \\[[@B6],[@B7],[@B9]\\]. Although PapMV tolerates insertion of several peptides to its C-terminus \\[[@B4]-[@B7],[@B10]\\], a recent study revealed that N-terminal fusion of some peptides is also tolerated \\[[@B8]\\]. Depending on the nature of the amino acid sequence, some peptides can interfere with the CP assembly or with nanoparticle stability, which can affect their ability to stimulate an humoral response. A modification of the fusion site on the CP can help to resolve this issue. In this study, we compared the efficacy of nanoparticles harbouring fusion of a CTL epitope at either the N- or the C-terminus to trigger a cellular immune response.\n\nThe crystalline and highly ordered structure of the nanoparticles is critical to triggering an efficient humoral response, as also reported by many other groups \\[[@B11]-[@B13]\\]. However, it is still unknown if assembly into the highly ordered nanoparticle structure, made of several hundreds of PapMV CP, is more efficient than assembly of a smaller disc-like structure (aggregate of 20 subunits) in triggering the CTL response. Since the mechanisms of induction of humoral and CTL immune responses rely on different immune cells and mechanisms, we also evaluated the importance of highly ordered assembly of recombinant PapMV CP into nanoparticles in triggering a CTL response by comparing the immunogenicity of nanoparticles and discs.\n\nResults and discussion\n======================\n\nEngineering of PapMV nanoparticles fused to the influenza CTL epitope\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn this study, we used the CTL epitope NP~147-155~, a 9-mer H-2Kd epitope specific for Balb/C mice derived from influenza virus to search for the optimal position for fusion of this epitope to the vaccine platform. The CTL epitope was flanked by 5 native residues of influenza NP protein at both the N- and C-termini to favour natural processing of the peptide, and was fused genetically to either the N- (before F13) or C-terminus of PapMV CP \\[Figure\u2009[1](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}A\\]. Following expression in *E. coli*, recombinant PapMV particles harbouring the peptide on their surface (named PapMV NP-12 and PapMV NP-C) were affinity purified on a Ni^2+^ column via the 6xHis tag located at the C-terminus \\[Figure\u2009[1](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}B\\]. Purified proteins were subjected to ultracentrifugation to pellet the nanoparticles. The lower molecular weight forms, composed of discs (20 subunits of CP) remained in the supernatant. As shown by dynamic light scattering (DLS), two structures were obtained with this purification protocol: (1) typical long rod-shaped structures of approximately 90\u2009nm in length for PapMV NP-12 and PapMV NP-C \\[Figure\u2009[1](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}C--D\\], and (2) smaller discs of approximately 20\u2009nm in length for PapMV NP-12 and PapMV NP-C \\[Figure\u2009[1](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}D\\]. The DLS method provides a global view of the size of the particles in solution that fits our qualitative observations by electron microscopy, and revealed the difference in size between discs (black line) and nanoparticles (dotted line) for both constructs (Figure\u2009[1](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}D). It also shows that structures formed by NP-12 and NP-C constructs are similar in size, confirming observations by transmission electron microscopy showing that PapMV NP-12 and NP-C nanoparticles are similar in length, structure and appearance \\[Figure\u2009[1](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}C\\].\n\n![**Recombinant PapMV CP proteins.**(**A**) Amino acid sequences of the N- or C-terminus of the PapMV CP to which fusions were made.

(**B**) Bacterial lysate of the culture before induction with IPTG (first lane), after induction with IPTG (second lane) and after purification with nickel beads (third lane) of PapMV NP-12 (lanes 1--3) and PapMV NP-C (lanes 4--6).

(**D**) Size of nanoparticles and discs recorded by dynamic light scattering (DLS).](1477-3155-11-10-1){#F1}\n\nWe previously reported that residue F13 of PapMV CP is critical for the interaction between the PapMV CP subunits when assembling into nanoparticles \\[[@B14]\\]. We showed that this hydrophobic residue fits snugly inside the hydrophobic pocket of the neighbouring CP \\[[@B2]\\]. Interestingly, insertion of the NP~147-155~ epitope just before F13 in the N-terminal fusions clearly does not interfere with the interaction between PapMV CP monomers that is crucial for self-assembly of nanoparticles.\n\nPapMV NP-12 nanoparticles are better inducers of the CTL response\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo evaluate the potential of PapMV nanoparticles to induce a CD8+ mediated cellular response, we immunised 6- to 8-week-old Balb/C mice three times at 2-week intervals by the intraperitoneal route with 100\u2009\u03bcg of PapMV (without fusion), NP-12 or NP-C nanoparticles. Two weeks after the second boost, spleens were harvested and ELISPOT assays using the NP~147-155~ peptide were performed to quantify the level of IFN-\u03b3 secreted by CD8+ cells \\[Figure\u2009[2](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}\\]. Secretion of IFN-\u03b3 is proportional to the level of precursors of CD8+ cytotoxic lymphocytes specific to the fused CTL epitope in vaccinated mice. The result showed that, compared to all the other treatments, mice immunized with PapMV NP-12 nanoparticles secrete significantly more IFN-\u03b3 \\[Figure\u2009[2](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}\\].\n\n![**ELISPOT assays of mice immunized with different forms of nanoparticles.**Mice, 5 per group, were immunized three times by the intraperitoneal route with 100\u2009\u03bcg of recombinant PapMV NP-12, PapMV NP-C and PapMV nanoparticles or discs. Two weeks after the second boost, spleens were extracted and ELISPOT assays performed. The precursor frequency of specific T cells was determined by subtracting the background spots in media alone from the number of spots seen in wells reactivated with NP~147-155~peptide. \\*\\*\\* p\u2009\u2264\u20090.001 compared to all groups.](1477-3155-11-10-2){#F2}\n\nFusion of a peptide to the PapMV vaccine platform could affect its stability, and potentially the ability to mount an immune response to the fused epitope \\[[@B8]\\]. As temperature can affect protein stability, we thus measured the influence of temperature on the aggregation of recombinant nanoparticles using DLS. Upon heating, proteins initiate partial denaturation through exposure of their hydrophobic residues to the solvent. This conformational change triggers formation of aggregates that can be measured easily by DLS. We found that PapMV NP-C nanoparticles initiated aggregation at 25\u00b0C while PapMV (without fusion) and NP-12 nanoparticles were more stable and initiated aggregation at 37\u00b0C or higher \\[Figure\u2009[3](#F3){ref-type=\"fig\"}A\\]. Therefore, the higher stability of NP-12 nanoparticles at 37\u00b0C or higher appears to correlate with an optimal CTL response in mice.\n\n![**Aggregation of PapMV nanoparticles and discs at different temperatures. A**) Aggregation state of recombinant nanoparticles or discs of PapMV NP-12, PapMV NP-C and PapMV (0.1\u2009mg/ml) was measured by DLS at increasing temperature (speed of heating: 1\u00b0C/min.). The increase in diameter induced by heat is caused by the aggregation of nanoparticles. **B**) Using the same conditions as in (**A**), the aggregation of recombinant nanoparticles of PapMV NP-12, PapMV NP-C and PapMV either treated or not with glutaraldehyde was measured by DLS.](1477-3155-11-10-3){#F3}\n\nBased on this observation, it was anticipated that stabilization of NP-C nanoparticles by chemical cross-linking should improve their immunogenicity. Therefore, we compared the capacity of NP-C and NP-12 nanoparticles either cross-linked with glutaraldehyde or not to induce a CTL response. The cross-linked nanoparticles were very stable even at temperatures exceeding 37\u00b0C \\[Figure\u2009[3](#F3){ref-type=\"fig\"}B\\]. Mice (5 per group) were immunized three times at 2-week intervals with 100\u2009\u03bcg of PapMV NP-C and NP-12 nanoparticles that were either cross-linked with glutaraldehyde or not. Surprisingly, cross-linking NP-C did not lead to an improved CTL response in mice \\[Figure\u2009[4](#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}\\]. The quantity of IFN-\u03b3 secreted by specific splenocytes remained similar to the response obtained with untreated nanoparticles. However, cross-linking of NP-12 nanoparticles did affect the efficacy CTL response induction as compared to native NP-12 \\[Figure\u2009[4](#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}\\]. We hypothesize that the cross-link made the nanoparticles too rigid, which consequently decreased their susceptibility to the proteases responsible for releasing the CTL epitope. To test this hypothesis, we resolved trypsin digests of cross-linked NP-12 and NP-C nanoparticles by SDS-PAGE (Figure\u2009[5](#F5){ref-type=\"fig\"}). NP-12 and NP-C nanoparticles were only partially susceptible to the digest and lost 3\u2009kDa on the gel as compared to non-digested nanoparticles. Cross-linked NP-C and NP-12 appeared resistant to digestion. The PapMV CP subunits of the cross-linked nanoparticles remained tightly attached to each other, leading to a very large molecular weight multimer that can barely enter the acrylamide gel. This experiment highlighted the likely difficulty of digesting cross-linked nanoparticles by host proteases involved in the excision of CTL epitopes for loading onto the MHC class 1 complex---an essential step in triggering a CTL response. In brief, nanoparticles must be sufficiently stable at animal body temperature (37\u00b0C) but flexible enough to allow their digestion by cellular proteases for loading onto MHC class 1 molecules. Therefore, an optimal balance between these two properties is crucial to triggering the CTL response efficiently.\n\n![**ELISPOT assays of immunized mice.**Mice, 5 per group, were immunized three times by the intraperitoneal route with 100\u2009\u03bcg of recombinant PapMV NP-12, PapMV NP-C and PapMV nanoparticles that were either untreated or cross-linked with glutaraldehyde.

PapMV NP-12 discs and nanoparticles were used to immunize (3 immunizations) mice (5 per group) with 100\u2009\u03bcg of protein. We measured the production of IFN-\u03bc after stimulation of splenocytes harvested from immunized mice 2\u2009weeks after the second boost using the NP~147-155~ peptide. The level of IFN-\u03b3 secreted by splenocytes specific to PapMV NP-12 nanoparticles was significantly higher than that specific to PapMV NP-12 discs \\[Figure\u2009[2](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}\\], suggesting that assembly into a highly ordered structure, i.e. nanoparticles, is critical to triggering the CTL response efficiently. We also noted that NP-12 discs appeared less stable than nanoparticles, and initiated aggregation at 34\u00b0C as compared to 37\u00b0C for nanoparticles \\[Figure\u2009[3](#F3){ref-type=\"fig\"}\\]. Discs have the same diameter but are shorter than nanoparticles (30\u2009nm vs 90\u2009nm) and also less stable. These differences in size and stability could account for the observed differences in immunogenicity. Another difference between discs and nanoparticles is the RNA that they contain. Discs are associated with only very small amounts of RNA but nanoparticles contains ssRNA of bacterial origin \\[[@B3]\\]. It is possible that the ssRNA found in nanoparticles plays a role in the efficacy of the measured immune response. It is known that ssRNA of bacterial origin, as found in PapMV nanoparticles, can be recognized as pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by several nucleic acid sensors like RIG-I, MDA-5, TLR7 or TLR8 that are at the interface between the innate and the adaptive immune response \\[[@B15]-[@B17]\\]. We are currently investigating if these sensors play a role in the CTL response.\n\nOur results are consistent with findings obtained with peptide fusions made at the N-terminus of the CP of potato virus X (PVX)---another member of the potexvirus family. It was shown that production of recombinant PVX virus particles *in planta* can elicit either an humoral \\[[@B18]\\] or a CTL immune response \\[[@B19]\\]. The use of the N-terminus for fusion of peptides on this type of vaccine platform can, however, be problematic if the recombinant virus particles are produced in planta because the fusion may interfere with long-distance transport of the virus throughout the plants and thus affect yield \\[[@B20]\\]. This is one of the main reasons why we chose to produce our nanoparticles in a bacterial expression system that does not depend on the replication or cell-to-cell transport of the virus.\n\nIt is well accepted that the N-terminus of PapMV and potexvirus CP is exposed at the surface of the virus particle \\[[@B2],[@B8],[@B21],[@B22]\\]. The recently published 3D structure of PapMV CP revealed that the N-terminus is involved in the interaction between two CP subunits in the virus particle \\[[@B2]\\], and that the 12\u2009N-terminal residues upstream of F13 are directly exposed on the surface \\[[@B14]\\]. The availability of the CTL epitope located at this position, as compared to the C-terminus, probably facilitates its cleavage by host proteases and favours loading of the MHC class I pocket in the immune cells \\[[@B6],[@B9]\\].\n\nConclusions\n===========\n\nThe results of this study improve our understanding of the PapMV vaccine platform and highlight the importance of nanoparticle stability in triggering a CTL response. We can now beneficiate of two different points of fusion for a CTL epitope on the PapMV CP. The fusion at the N-terminus was clearly superior for the NP~147-155~ peptide but it does not mean that this will be the case for another CTL epitope. The amino acid sequence of the CTL epitope and its influence on the structure on the PapMV CP can have a major impact on its stability and their immunogenicity. Those results are increasing the versatility of the vaccine platform and provide more options for production of stable constructs. Because it is well established that the trigger of a CTL response to conserved epitopes is a valuable approach in the design of prophylactic or therapeutic vaccines to chronic diseases \\[[@B23]-[@B27]\\], we believe that the PapMV vaccine platform will be a very useful tool.\n\nMethods\n=======\n\nEthics statement\n----------------\n\nAll the work with animals adhered to the Institution-approved ethics protocol of the \"Comit\u00e9 de Protection des Animaux\" -- CHUQ (CPA-CHUQ). The approval of this project is listed under the authorization number 2010148--1.\n\nCloning and production of PapMV NP constructs\n---------------------------------------------\n\nThe PapMV CP construct (CP\u0394N5) used for this study has been described previously (Tremblay et al., 2006). To generate the PapMV NP constructs, PapMV CP\u0394N5 was used to introduce the following oligonucleotides by PCR at position 12 at the C-terminus of the coat protein \\[Table\u2009[1](#T1){ref-type=\"table\"}\\]. The linear vector harbouring the NP~147-155~ coding region fused to the PapMV was digested with BsiWI and ligated using T4 DNA ligase (New England BioLabs). The resulting PapMV NP clones harbour a fusion of the nucleoprotein epitope from Influenza virus at position 12 or at their C-terminus followed by a 6xHis tag for the purification process. We retained five amino acids on either side of the H-2Kd CTL epitope to ensure efficient processing. The integrity of the PapMV NP clones was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Expression and purification of PapMV particles fused to the NP~147-155~ peptide was performed as described previously \\[[@B5]\\]. Levels of expression for each recombinant nanoparticle were determined by SDS-PAGE. LPS contamination was always less than 50 endotoxin units (EU)/mg of protein. The size and structure of the nanoparticles were confirmed by observation on a TEM (JEOL-1010, Tokyo, Japan).\n\n###### \n\nForward and reverse oligonucleotides used to produce PapMV CP recombinant proteins\n\n  ***Name***   ***Oligonucleotide sequence***\n  ------------ -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  **NP-12**    \n  Forward      5^\u2032^-AGCT***CGTACG***CGTGCGCTGGTTCGTACCGGTATGGACTTCCCCGCCATCACCCAGGAAC-3^\u2032^\n  Reverse      5^\u2032^-TCGA***CGTACG***CTGGTAGGTCGCGTCGTTCAGGTTGGCTATGTTGGGTGTGGATGCC-3^\u2032^\n  **NP-C**     \n  Forward      5^\u2032^-ACGT***CGTACG***CGTGCGCTGGTTCGTACCGGTATGGACACGCGTCACCATCACCATCAC-3^\u2032^\n  Reverse      5^\u2032^-TCGA***CGTACG***CTGGTAGGTCGCGTCGTTCAGGTTACTAGTTTCGGGGGG-3^\u2032^\n\nDynamic light scattering\n------------------------\n\nThe size of nanoparticles and discs was determined using a ZetaSizer Nano ZS (Malvern, Worcestershire, United Kingdom) at a temperature of 4\u00b0C and at a concentration of 0.1\u2009mg/ml in PBS 1x for nanoparticles and at a concentration of 0.25\u2009mg/ml in Tris--HCl 10\u2009mM for discs. The thermal stability of PapMV nanoparticles was measured under the same experimental conditions at temperatures from 24\u00b0C to 40\u00b0C.\n\nChemical cross-linking with glutaraldehyde\n------------------------------------------\n\nCross-linking was performed using 0.1% glutaraldehyde in 10\u2009mM Tris, 50\u2009mM NaCl pH\u20097.5 in a final volume of 50\u2009\u03bcl. The optimal concentration of protein for cross-linking was 150\u2009ng/ml. After addition of glutaraldehyde, the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30\u2009minutes in the dark. The reaction was stopped with 15\u2009\u03bcl of loading dye and heated for 10\u2009minutes at 95\u00b0C before separating the proteins by 8% SDS-PAGE. The cross-linked proteins used to immunize mice were stored at 4\u00b0C until immunization without adding loading dye.\n\nSDS-PAGE and trypsin digest\n---------------------------\n\nPrior to SDS-PAGE, samples were mixed with one-third of the final volume of loading buffer containing 5% SDS, 30% glycerol and 0.01% bromophenol blue and heated for 10\u2009minutes at 95\u00b0C. For the trypsin digest, we incubated 10\u2009\u03bcg of proteins at 37\u00b0C in a volume of 50\u2009\u03bcl for 120\u2009minutes in 100\u2009mM Tris--HCl pH\u20098.5 with 0.2\u2009\u03bcg trypsin (Roche, 1418475). The reaction was stopped by adding 10\u2009\u03bcl of loading dye. Samples were heated for 10\u2009minutes at 95\u00b0C prior to loading on SDS-PAGE \\[[@B3]\\].\n\nImmunization\n------------\n\nFive 6- to 8-week-old Balb/C mice (Charles River, Wilmington, MA) were immunized by the intraperitoneal route with: (i) 100\u2009\u03bcg of PapMV NP-12 nanoparticles; (ii) 100\u2009\u03bcg of PapMV NP-C nanoparticles; (iii) 100\u2009\u03bcg of PapMV CP nanoparticles; (iv) 100\u2009\u03bcg of PapMV NP-12 discs, and (v) 100\u2009\u03bcg of PapMV NP-C discs. Primary immunization was followed by two booster doses given at 2-week intervals. Blood samples were obtained before each injection and 2\u2009weeks after the last one and stored at -20\u00b0C until analysis.\n\nELISPOT\n-------\n\nTwo weeks after the last boost, mice were sacrificed and spleens were recovered for ELISPOT assay performed as described previously \\[[@B25]\\]. The precursor frequency of specific T cells was determined by subtracting the background spots in media alone from the number of spots seen in wells reactivated with NP~147-155~ peptide. Data were analyzed with a parametric or a non-parametric ANOVA test when the variances differed significantly and with a Tukey or a Dunn post-test to compare difference among groups of mice. Values of \\*p\u2009\\<\u20090.05, \\*\\*p\u2009\\<\u20090.01 and \\*\\*\\*p\u2009\\<\u20090.001 were considered statistically significant.
