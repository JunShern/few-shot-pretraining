No wonder kids from FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) and their robots were chosen to lead the iconic Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade and invited to the White House Science Fair on multiple occasions and earned investment money for their invention from ABC\u2019s hit TV show, Shark Tank.\n\nWhy robotics?\n\n\u201cRobotics is the 21st-century sport for the mind,\u201d says Kamen. \u201cIf we want kids to study STEM, we need to show them that these fields are just as accessible, fun and rewarding as playing sports. And it\u2019s the one sport where everyone can turn pro.\u201d\n\nApparently, the need to push this idea is self-evident in the U.S. Data from the Program for International Student Assessment, which shows how U.S. students stack up against those in 65 top industrial countries:\n\n31st in math.\n\n23rd in science.\n\nBut take a look at students involved with FIRST. Kids ages 6-18 take on robotics challenges and invention programs while they increase their problem-solving abilities and leadership skills.\nPresident Obama celebrated students at the recent White House Science Fair for their innovative ideas. One of the participants, Parker Owen, was honored for his invention, the Cycle-Leg \u2014 an inexpensive prosthetic made from a single recycled bicycle.\n\n\u201cFor all of the problems in the world, FIRST to me is a solution. They are shaping and encouraging the next generation to be contributors rather than consumers,\u201d Owen says.\n\nU.S. companies are also relying on the organization to fuel the workforce pipeline with innovative problem-solvers \u2014 more than 3,500 corporate sponsors include Boeing, Google, Qualcomm and United Technologies.\n\nHere\u2019s the biggest proof point: FIRST offers more than $20 million in scholarships. So it\u2019s no surprise that its alumni accounted for almost 10 percent of the entering freshmen class in 2013 at the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).\n\n\u201cFIRST isn\u2019t just a robotics program, it\u2019s a life-changing experience,\u201d says Emily Stern, who is studying mechanical engineering at MIT."
