If an error is thrown anywhere inside of a try block, it will exit at the line of the error (skip the rest of the code) and run what is in the catch block.  If there is no error in the try block, the code in the catch block will never run.\n\nWith PHP  (though I don't have php anywhere handy to check so this may need to be corrected by someone, and it's been about 10 years since I've programmed with it)\n<?php \n    header(\"Content-Type: text/plain\");\n    print time() * 1000;\n?>\n\n"
