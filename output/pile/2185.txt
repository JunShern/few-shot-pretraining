    "text": "We were literally talking about this yesterday waiting for a mechanic forever. xD\nThe current system needs work. As mentioned, the waiting time is too long, nobody wants to be sitting around for half an hour for a mechanic to show up.\nI definitely appreciate that not everything needs to be instant, but to make this problem worse, it tells us how many mechanics are online - but what people don't know is that not all of them are allowed/trained to go out. This just makes it seem like the 10+ mechanics online are just ignoring us.\nHaving a shop item would solve this. Do I think this is always going to be needed? No. But I certainly think for now, and for a long time it's been needed.\n\nAs a friendly pointer, might I suggest you take these reports a little more seriously. You have broken a rule and your attitude suggests to me that you do not care.\nThanks to all involved, I see no reason to respond further.\n\nYou weren't gone that long... so, I won't comment on that.\nYou could've just DM'd me one more time to let me know you couldn't come back but instead kept me waiting for a while.\nDon't really know what to say. I'd be happy with just a 'verbal' warning but up to staff.\n\nPlayer(s) being reported: Theo Smalls (ID 13)\nDate of interaction reported: 07/NOV/2019\nUnix time stamp from HUD: 1573153936\nYour characters name: Kai DeVito\nOther player(s) involved: N/A\nSpecific rule(s) broken:\n8. Non-Roleplay (NRP)\nActions that are unrealistic or promote poor quality roleplay are considered as non-roleplay.\nExamples of actions that are considered as non-roleplay:\n\u2022 Cop Baiting - Provoking a reaction from emergency services without a realistic reason.\n\u2022 Mercy Killing - Asking to be killed by a friend (Killing a friend falls under deathmatching).\n\u2022 Unrealistic stunt jumping or the use of an expensive vehicle to ram into other vehicles.\n\u2022 Spawning a scripted work vehicle and using it for crimes or submerging any vehicle in water.\n\u2022 Swimming in water for an unrealistic amount of time or without a destination during a chase.\nPlayers who disconnect during roleplay must reconnect and inform other parties in order to resume roleplay. If you are unable to reconnect it may be excused after providing proof.\nIn a situation where a player gets away from an incident where they're being chased/pursued, they must wait 15 minutes before they can logout. Players should not instigate roleplay situations if they do not have time to play it through.\nPlayers who ignore answering roleplay commands directed at them, e.g. /do.\nIn a situation where a player\u2019s game crashes or the player is kicked from the server, they should be allowed to have the same advantages as they have had before their leave.\nHow did the player break the rule(s)?\nThe player timed out from in game, and initially made no attempt to alert me to him crashing. The player had earlier tried to add me on Discord to provide a video of whether the door was open on his screen or not. I gave him some time to let me know, however he did not and so I PM'd him after there was also no response in the ECRP General Chat.\nHe responded saying that his game had crashed, however he seemingly made no attempt to come back, and then stopped responded altogether, ignoring my messages. I waited a full 35-40 minutes as he had previously said he would return and nothing came of it.\nEvidence of rule breach:\nMy video contains staff chat, I shall DM whoever is handling this.\n\nMy suggestion, in my opinion, makes this whole system much much better.\nIt allows people to leave messages without having to know the owner.\nAs mentioned in OP - its better to not necessarily declare the owner too easily.\n\nCurrently, if you're trying to get in touch or leave a message for an owner of a house, its impossible if you dont know who it is.\nHaving a way you can leave a message where they are alerted in chat (similar to ticket system maybe) would be extremely beneficial to the server, property owners, buyers as well as friends. You'd get this notification as you enter your home, that way there is no metagaming and may encourage people to check their home and mail more often.\nThis would certainly help with people trying to purchase houses or any other needs of contact.\nTheres an argument for further information, however I dont think there should be names, phone numbers or emails so that owners can remain anonymous.\n\nPersonally, I prefer the way name changes are now. I do not believe it should return to the in game option it had before, as this often promotes a careless attitude towards changing names.\nI can agree that there are plenty of reasons to change it, but unfortunately if its really worth it, then using credits is worth it.\nIf you live in a country that does not have the ability to perform international transactions, that's unfortunate. It's a shame but that should not restrict the progression of the server or these types of decisions. This new system, in my opinion, improves the server and should remain. I am not totally familiar with the options you may have, but you could attempt to get someone to gift you credits.\nEither way, -1.\n\nPlayer(s) being reported: ID 31\nDate of interaction reported: 08/SEP/2019\nUnix time stamp from HUD: 1567944831\nYour characters name: Kai DeVito\nOther player(s) involved: ID 2, 91 and 110 - I think they are all 'victims'. Police later showed up after one of them shot at 31 to defend themselves.\nSpecific rule(s) broken:\n14. Deathmatch (DM)\nDeathmatching is the act of attacking a player or their property without a proper roleplay reason.\nExamples of valid reasons to attack another player:\n\u2022 If they attempt to arrest or hurt you, an ally, or damage your property.\n\u2022 If they report you to the police for a serious crime.\n\u2022 If they are not in compliance with demands, attempt to escape, or call other players for help in a situation where they are required to display fear under fear roleplay rules.\nA player cannot kill their victim if the victim is in compliance with the demands.\nA player must allow their victim enough time to comply with the demands.\nIf a player informs you that your VOIP isn\u2019t working, you must either fix your VOIP using appropriate commands or use text to deliver your demand(s).\nVehicles cannot be used to attack another player more than once including a failed attempt.\nAttacking another player with no engagement in roleplay is not allowed.\nKilling a player that has obeyed all orders and demands during a roleplay situation is allowed, with roleplay, only within 3 hours of:\ufeff\nSevere hostile or criminal action is taken against you, e.g. someone is robbing you at gunpoint. (Excluding police aiming a gun at you.)\nSomeone is attempting to take your life.\ufeff\nSomeone is attempting to take the life of your close friend or ally, or if you have witnessed it happen.\nYou must explain your reason to kill to the player IC and have OOC evidence proving your reason.\nHow did the player break the rule(s)?\nPlayer repeatedly used his vehicle to ram the players involved. He made multiple attempts to ram, drive away and drive back.\nEvidence of rule breach:\nI will need to provide this to Staff as it includes staff chat and so on. Apologies in advance for background noise (Netflix on 2nd monitor). There's also a slight break in the video as the first part is Shadowplay of last few minutes, then continued on live recording.\n\nBudget is flexible and purely dependant on the property you are selling.\nI am most likely only interested in a house, not an apartment. Preferably with at least one garage.\nFeel free to contact me by phone too at: #3724977\n\nAs said above, you can't set multiple people with the same one.\nWhilst I could see the argument for allowing multiple people with the names, I also see this problematic in terms of immersion when you get confused between people just based on their names, even though in character you would recognise them by more than just a hovering name"
