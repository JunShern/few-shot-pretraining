This book contains many real life examples derived from the author's experience as a Linux system and network administrator, trainer and consultant. They hope these examples will help you to get a better understanding of the Linux system and that you feel encouraged to try out things on your own.\n\nI have C programming tutorials in Linux videos. You will need to have GCC and GDB in your system, and all is done in console or terminal. I think this is better way to learn C in Linux. The link is: http://www.youtube.com/user/TheShellWave\n\nThe best book I've found for the C++11 Standard Library isThe C++ Standard Library - A Tutorial and Reference, 2nd Edition by Nicolai M. Josuttis. (The first edition covers the library prior to C++11.) Mr. Josuttis has also written Object-Oriented Programming in C++ and co-authored C++ Templates: The Complete Guide with David Vandevoorde.\n\nNote that some features of the C++11 Standard Library have not yet been implemented in gcc :-( and must be obtained from one or another of the c libraries.\n\nI like Mr. Josuttis' Object-Oriented Programming in C++ because, in contrast with many other C++ books I have tried to learn from, it is a treatise on pure C++, not a book about C with use of the << and >> methods and a few chapters in the back about classes and methods.\n\nNew Link! I have C programming tutorials in Linux videos. You will need to have GCC and GDB in your system, and all is done in console or terminal. I think this is better way to learn C in Linux. The link is: http://www.youtube.com/user/IOVideoWave\n\nMoved my C Programming in Linux Tutorials to another channel. You will need to have GCC and GDB in your system, and all is done in console or terminal. I think this is better way to learn C in Linux. My YouTube channel name is ShellWaveX"
