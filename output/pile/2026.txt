I'm hoping to find a way to do this without having to individually spline every Model once at a time.\nSo I have the following df:\nmydf<- data.frame(c(\"a\",\"a\",\"b\",\"b\",\"c\",\"c\"),c(\"e\",\"e\",\"e\",\"e\",\"e\",\"e\")\n                 ,as.numeric(c(1,2,3,10,20,30)),\n                 as.numeric(c(5,10,20,20,15,10)))\n\nGive some names:\ncolnames(mydf)<-c(\"Model\", \"Class\",\"Seconds\", \"Speed\")\n\nWhich creates:\n> mydf\n  Model Class Seconds Speed\n1     a     e       1     5\n2     a     e       2    10\n3     b     e       3    20\n4     b     e      10    20\n5     c     e      20    15\n6     c     e      30    10\n\nSo I want a spline on the Seconds and Speed columns for each Model. So for example if I used spline on Model \"a\", it you only spline those elements on \"a\" as the model.\nLike:\nspline(x=mydf[1:2,3], y=mydf[1:2,4])\n$x\n[1] 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0\n\n$y\n[1]  5  6  7  8  9 10\n\nThis works but when you have a hundreds of models...\nI want to spline \"a\" only using \"a\" and then it moves to \"b\" and splines only \"b\" etc. Ideally it would output as a new dataframe but at this point I'd just like to not get an error.\nI tried ddply in plyr but getting errors. I'm hoping to avoid using loops or functions with loops but if that's the only option then...\nThanks and please let me know if I can improve the question.\n\nA:\n\nWhat about this:\nddply(mydf, .(Model), summarise, Spline = spline(x = Seconds, y = Speed), \n      Var = c(\"Seconds\", \"Speed\"))\n  Model                        Spline     Var\n1     a  1.0, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 2.0 Seconds\n2     a             5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10   Speed\n3     b 3.0, 4.4, 5.8, 7.2, 8.6, 10.0 Seconds\n4     b        20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20   Speed\n5     c        20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30 Seconds\n6     c        15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10   Speed\n\n"
