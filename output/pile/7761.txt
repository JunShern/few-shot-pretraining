But usually 3rd party themes don't get upgraded at all, which means you can modify theme templates. Because the templates are sort-of too complex to be extended by a child theme, it is ok to edit them directly. PretaShop doesn't have child-parent theme system. Just edit the templates directly.\nIf you would like your changes to be portable accross themes, then you should probably make a module. Inside the module use special functions to add .js and .css files to header:\nmymodule.php\n\n...\n\npublic function install()\n{\n   ...\n   $this->registerHook('displayHeader');\n   ...\n}\n\npublic function hookDispayHeader()\n{\n   $this->context->controller->addJS($this->_path.'js/script.js');\n   $this->context->controller->addCSS($this->_path.'css/style.css');\n}\n\nIf you need a quick way to add, just edit theme's global.css and global.js\nYou may also add the stysheet and script to autload folder:\nthemes/theme1/css/autoload/ and \nthemes/theme1/js/autoload/. Files inside these folder will be loaded for all pages.\n\n"
