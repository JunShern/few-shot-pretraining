Bryant.\n\n               APPEALS from the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas\n\nKLATT, J.\n       {\u00b6 1} In these consolidated appeals, defendants-appellants William M. Bryant,\nKenneth Bryant, and Kyle L. Klinkner each appeal from judgment entries of conviction\nand sentence entered by the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas. For the following\nreasons, we affirm those judgments.\nI. Factual and Procedural Background\n       {\u00b6 2} A Franklin County Grand Jury indicted all three appellants with one count\nof felonious assault, in violation of R.C. 2903.11. The charges arose out of a fight involving\nthe three men and Kenneth's former employer, Victor Tantarelli, Sr. Appellants entered\nnot guilty pleas and proceeded to a trial. Appellants waived their rights to a jury trial and\nall three appellants were tried together to the same judge.\n       {\u00b6 3} Victor Tantarelli, Sr. (\"Vic Sr.\") owns a body shop in Columbus, Ohio, and\nemployed Kenneth as an auto technician in 2011. In December 2011, Kenneth stopped\nworking for Vic Sr. and apparently left repair work on a number of cars unfinished.\nAccording to Vic Sr.'s policy, however, he does not pay employees for their time until they\ncomplete their work on the assigned cars. Because Kenneth left his work unfinished, he\nhad not been paid for some of the time he had worked.\n       {\u00b6 4} On January 6, 2012, Kenneth returned to the body shop to pick up his tools.\nHe brought with him his dad, William, and Kyle Klinkner. William and Kyle were both\nauto technicians at Kenneth's new place of employment. Kyle drove the three men to the\nbody shop because he had a big truck that could hold Kenneth's tool box, which weighed\nalmost 1,000 pounds. The men went in the body shop, got the tool box, and brought it\nout to Kyle's truck. Kenneth also handed his keys to the body shop to Vic Sr.'s son, Vic Jr.\nThe three men went back to the truck and remained there for 10 to 15 minutes.\n\fNos. 13AP-469, 13AP-521 and 13AP-595                                                   3\n\n       {\u00b6 5} At that point, the three men got out of the truck and walked back inside the\nbody shop. Kenneth went inside the office where Vic Sr. was eating lunch and William\nand Kyle stood outside the office door. Kenneth asked Vic Sr. if he planned to pay him for\nthe work Kenneth did on the unfinished jobs. Vic Sr. told him that he would not pay him\nbecause Kenneth quit before the cars were finished. The men began yelling at each other\nand Vic Sr. came out from behind the desk where he was sitting and approached Kenneth.\nHere, the respective versions of events begin to diverge.\n       {\u00b6 6} According to Vic Sr. and another employee of the body shop, when Vic Sr.\napproached Kenneth, Kenneth punched him twice in the chest. He then pulled Vic Sr.\ndown to the ground and pinned Vic Sr.'s arms close to his body. While Kenneth held Vic\nSr. down on the ground, William punched him a few times and Kyle kicked him a number\nof times. Employees of the body shop soon came out and broke up the fight, after which\nWilliam, Kenneth, and Kyle left the scene. Vic Sr. sustained serious physical injuries as a\nresult of the fight.\n       {\u00b6 7} Appellants each presented slightly different versions of events. They each\ntestified that they went over to the body shop to get Kenneth's tools. Kenneth testified,\nhowever, that he decided to ask Vic Sr. for some money that day because some repair\nshops will pay an auto technician for time spent working on a car even if the technician\nquits before completing the work. When Vic Sr. told Kenneth he would not pay him,\nKenneth swore at him and began walking out of the office. According to Kenneth, Vic Sr.\nwas yelling as Vic Sr. approached him. Vic Sr. pushed him and Kenneth grabbed at Vic Sr.\nso he would not fall down. The two men became entangled and fell to the floor. Kenneth\ndenied punching Vic Sr. or pinning his arms while they were on the ground. He thought\nthey were only on the ground for a few seconds until he was able to release himself from\nVic Sr. and leave the scene. He did not observe William or Kyle hit Vic Sr.\n       {\u00b6 8} Kyle testified that he was standing near the office when he heard Kenneth\nand Vic Sr. yelling at each other. He then saw Vic Sr. grab at Kenneth's shirt. He did not\nsee Kenneth punch Vic Sr. Kyle thought that Kenneth lost his footing and grabbed at Vic\nSr. to stop his fall. The two men stumbled around and fell down. Kyle stated he did see\nKenneth holding Vic Sr.'s arms. Kyle and William began to go toward the fight but as they\n\fNos. 13AP-469, 13AP-521 and 13AP-595                                                  4\n\ndid, they saw Vic Jr. and another man coming to break up the fight. Kyle denied kicking\nVic Sr. but testified that William punched Vic Sr. and may have kicked him once.\n      {\u00b6 9} William testified that all three of the men went inside the body shop so that\nKenneth could get his last paycheck. Kenneth went into the office while William and Kyle\nstood nearby. Kenneth asked Vic Sr. for his check but Vic Sr. told him that he would not\npay him because the work was not finished. The two men began to escalate their voices\nand then William saw Kenneth start to leave the office. Vic Sr. came at Kenneth and\npushed him as if he wanted him out of the office. Vic Sr. also grabbed Kenneth and the\ntwo came \"flying out\" of the office and then fell down. (Tr. 996.) William did not see\nKenneth punch Vic Sr. before they fell to the ground. According to William, Kenneth had\nVic Sr. on the ground in a bear hug while Vic Sr. yelled for help. William saw Vic Sr.\nstrangling Kenneth and also trying to kick him. William became scared for his son's life,\nso he approached the two men and kicked and hit Vic Sr. to free Kenneth from the\naltercation. Shortly thereafter, the other men came to the scene of the fight and broke it\nup.\n      {\u00b6 10} The trial judge found all three appellants guilty of felonious assault. The\njudge found the appellants' version of events not credible and concluded that they went to\nthe body shop to either get money from Victor Sr. or to beat him up. The trial court\nsentenced them accordingly.\nII. The Appeals\n      {\u00b6 11} All three appellants appeal their convictions.\n      {\u00b6 12} William Bryant assigns the following errors:\n             [1.] Given the nature of the case, the evidence presented by\n             the State, and the defenses asserted by Defendant-Appellant,\n             the failure of the trial court to conduct a hearing to evaluate\n             the nature and extent of plea negotiations was error.\n\n             [2.] The judgment of the trial court is not supported by\n             sufficient, credible evidence.\n\n             [3.] The judgment of the trial court is against the manifest\n             weight of the evidence.\n\n      {\u00b6 13} Kyle L.

COOPER, THE CASE MUST\n            BE REMANDED TO THE TRIAL COURT FOR A HEARING\n            TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE ACCUSED WAS\n            PROPERLY ADVISED BY HIS ATTORNEY CONSISTENT\n            WITH THE SIXTH AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS TO\n            THE CONSTITUTION.\n\n            [5.] WHEN TRIAL COUNSEL COMMITS CONSTITU-\n            TIONAL VIOLATIONS REPRESENTING THE ACCUSED\n            DURING THE PRE-TRIAL AND TRIAL STAGES, THE CASE\n            MUST BE REVERSED AND REMANDED FOR A NEW\n            TRIAL BECAUSE OF INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF\n            COUNSEL, CONTRA THE SIXTH AND FOURTEENTH\n            AMENDMENTS TO THE CONSTITUTION.\n\n      {\u00b6 14} Finally, Kenneth Bryant assigns the following errors:\n            [1.] APPELLANT KENNETH BRYANT WAS DEPRIVED OF\n            DUE PROCESS WHEN THE STATE AMENDED THE\n            INDICTMENT.\n\fNos. 13AP-469, 13AP-521 and 13AP-595                                                       6\n\n              [2.] APPELLANT KENNETH BRYANT WAS DEPRIVED OF\n              THE EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL WHEN HIS\n              ATTORNEYS FAILED TO MOVE FOR JUDGMENT OF\n              ACQUITTAL AFTER THE STATE'S OPENING STATEMENT.\n\n              [3.] APPELLANT KENNETH BRYANT'S CONVICTION\n              DEPRIVED HIM OF DUE PROCESS BECAUSE IT WAS\n              BASED ON INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE OR WAS AGAINST\n              THE MANIFEST WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE.\n\n              [4.] WHEN THERE IS NO INDICATION OF THE STATUS\n              OF PLEA NEGOTIATIONS, UNDER LAFLER V. COOPER,\n              APPELLANT KENNETH BRYANT'S CASE MUST BE\n              REMANDED FOR A HEARING TO DETERMINE\n              WHETHER HE WAS PROPERLY ADVISED OF THE PLEA\n              OFFER.\n\n       {\u00b6 15} We will address the assignments of error out of order and, where\nappropriate, together.\n       A. Kyle's Individual Assignments of Error\n              1. Severance\n       {\u00b6 16} Kyle argues in his second assignment of error that the trial court erred by\nnot severing his trial from his co-defendants. We disagree.\n       {\u00b6 17} Before addressing the merits of Kyle's claim, we note that he never asked\nthe trial court to sever his trial from his co-defendants. That failure forfeits error on\nappeal absent plain error. State v. Lott, 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 164 (1990). Under Crim.R.\n52(B), plain errors affecting substantial rights may be noticed by an appellate court even\nthough they were not brought to the attention of the trial court. To constitute plain error,\nthere must be: (1) an error, i.e., a deviation from a legal rule, (2) that is plain or obvious,\nand (3) that affected substantial rights, i.e., affected the outcome of the trial. State v.\nBarnes, 94 Ohio St.3d 21, 27 (2002). Even if an error satisfies these prongs, appellate\ncourts are not required to correct the error. Appellate courts retain discretion to correct\nplain errors. Id.; State v. Litreal, 170 Ohio App.3d 670, 2006-Ohio-5416, \u00b6 12 (10th\nDist.). Courts are to notice plain error under Crim.R. 52(B) \" 'with the utmost caution,\nunder exceptional circumstances and only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice.' \"\nBarnes, quoting State v. Long, 53 Ohio St.2d 91 (1978), paragraph three of syllabus.\n\fNos. 13AP-469, 13AP-521 and 13AP-595                                                     7\n\n       {\u00b6 18} Crim.R. 8(D) provides that co-defendants may be tried together for a non-\ncapital offense as long as they are alleged to have participated in the same act or\ntransaction or in the same course of criminal conduct. State v. Walters, 10th Dist. No.\n06AP-693, 2007-Ohio-5554, \u00b6 21. As a general rule, the law favors joinder of trials\nbecause, among other reasons, it conserves judicial resources and reduces the possibility\nof incongruous results before different juries. Id.; State v. Miller, 10th Dist. No. 11AP-\n899, 2013-Ohio-1242, \u00b6 50. Nevertheless, a defendant may move for severance from a co-\ndefendant's trial pursuant to Crim.R. 14 upon a showing of prejudice. Lott at 163. The\ndefendant has the burden to affirmatively demonstrate prejudice. State v. Payne, 10th\nDist. No. 02AP-723, 2003-Ohio-4891, \u00b6 23.\n       {\u00b6 19} Appellants' indictment alleged that they participated in the same act.\nTherefore, under Crim.R. (8), it was appropriate for them to be tried together. Kyle\nargues, however, that his trial should have been severed because of the antagonistic\ndefenses which arose between himself and his co-defendants. Antagonistic defenses can\nprejudice co-defendants to warrant severance. Walters at \u00b6 23-24. Defenses are mutually\nantagonistic where each defendant attempts to exculpate himself and inculpate his co-\ndefendants. Walters. To merit severance, the defenses must be antagonistic to the point\nof being irreconcilable and mutually exclusive. Miller at \u00b6 52, citing Walters.\n       {\u00b6 20} We reject Kyle's claim that his defense was mutually antagonistic with that\nof the Bryants' defenses. Kyle's defense at trial was that he did not kick or hit Vic Sr.\nAlternatively, William's defense at trial was that he acted in defense of his son and\nKenneth argued that the state failed to meet its burden of proof to prove that he assaulted\nVic Sr. These defenses did not attempt to exculpate one person while inculpating another.\nIn fact, neither William nor Kenneth testified that Kyle ever hit Vic Sr. or otherwise placed\nblame on Kyle.     Simply put, there is nothing antagonistic about the defenses these\nappellants presented at trial. Accordingly, the trial court did not err, let alone commit\nplain error, by not severing Kyle's trial from that of his co-defendants. We overrule Kyle's\nsecond assignment of error.\n\fNos. 13AP-469, 13AP-521 and 13AP-595                                                       8\n\n               2. Jury Waiver\n       {\u00b6 21} Kyle argues in his third assignment of error that we should remand this case\nfor the trial court to determine whether he knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to a\njury trial. We disagree.\n       {\u00b6 22} At the start of his trial, Kyle signed a document in which he \"voluntarily\nwaive[d] and relinquish[ed] my right to a trial by jury and elect[ed] to be tried by a judge.\"\nUpon receiving the document, the trial court asked Kyle whether he could read and write\nEnglish, whether his trial counsel explained the document to him and if he understood the\ndocument, and whether he understood the right to a jury trial that he sought to waive.\nLastly, the trial court asked him if this was his \"free and voluntary act.\" (Tr. 4-6.) Kyle\nreplied affirmatively to each question and the trial court accepted his waiver and had it\nfiled in the record.\n       {\u00b6 23} The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, made applicable to\nthe states through the Fourteenth Amendment, guarantees an accused the right to trial by\njury. State v. Lomax, 114 Ohio St.3d 350, 2007-Ohio-4277, \u00b6 6, citing Duncan v.\nLouisiana, 391 U.S. 145 (1968). Likewise, Ohio Constitution, Article I, Section 5, states\nthat the \"right of trial by jury shall be inviolate.\" However, Crim.R. 23(A) allows a\ndefendant to waive his right to a trial by jury in serious offense cases provided that the\nwaiver is made knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily, and in writing. Additionally,\npursuant to R.C. 2945.05, for a waiver of jury trial to be valid, it must be in writing, signed\nby the defendant, filed, made part of the record, and made in open court. Lomax at \u00b6 9;\nState v. Sanders, 188 Ohio App.3d 452, 2010-Ohio-3433, \u00b6 11 (10th Dist.). A written\nwaiver is presumptively voluntary, knowing, and intelligent. Lomax at \u00b6 10.\n       {\u00b6 24} Kyle concedes that the trial court complied with Crim.R. 23(A) and R.C.\n2945.05. Further, he does not argue that his waiver was not voluntary. Instead, he argues\nthat in light of the antagonistic defenses that developed between him and his co-\ndefendants, this court should remand the matter for the trial court to further question\nhim about the voluntary and intelligent nature of his waiver. We disagree. Kyle has not\nalleged or demonstrated any error below and, in fact, concedes that the trial court\nsatisfied its obligations before accepting his waiver. Accordingly, we overrule Kyle's third\nassignment of error.\n\fNos. 13AP-469, 13AP-521 and 13AP-595                                                      9\n\n               3. Motion for New Trial\n       {\u00b6 25} Kyle also seeks this court to stay these proceedings and to remand his case\nfor the trial court to rule on a pending motion for new trial. We already denied Kyle's first\nrequest for the same relief and he presents nothing new to justify a different decision.\nState v. Klinkner, 10th Dist. No. 13AP-469, Sept. 24, 2013 (journal entry). Therefore, we\ndeny this relief.\n               4. Conclusion\n       {\u00b6 26} We overrule Kyle's first, second, and third assignments of error.\n       B. Kenneth's Individual Assignment of Error\n               1. The State's \"amendment\" of his Indictment\n       {\u00b6 27} The grand jury indicted Kenneth with a single count of felonious assault in\nviolation of R.C. 2903.11(A). Kenneth argues in his first assignment of error that the state\n\"constructively amended\" that indictment during his trial. Specifically, Kenneth points\nout that he was originally charged as a principal offender but then identified as an aider\nand abettor during trial. We reject this argument.\n       {\u00b6 28} The state did not need to amend the indictment to proceed under an aiding\nand abetting theory against Kenneth.        Pursuant to R.C. 2923.03(F), \"[a] charge of\ncomplicity may be stated in terms of this section, or in terms of the principal offense.\"\nThus, a defendant charged with an offense may be convicted of that offense upon proof\nthat he was complicit in its commission, even though the indictment is \"stated * * * in\nterms of the principal offense\" and does not mention complicity. State v. Herring, 94\nOhio St.3d 246, 251 (2002). R.C. 2923.03(F) adequately notifies defendants that the jury\nmay be instructed on complicity, even when the charge is drawn in terms of the principal\noffense. See State v. Keenan, 81 Ohio St.3d 133, 151 (1998).\n       {\u00b6 29} Kenneth's reliance on State v. Killings, 1st Dist. No. C-970167 (May 29,\n1998), in support of this assignment of error is misplaced, as it is factually distinguishable\nfrom the present matter. In that case, the defendant was charged as a principal offender\nfor one count of rape. However, the trial court instructed the jury on complicity for a\nseparate rape (of the same victim) committed by another individual for which Killings was\nnot charged with nor provided an opportunity to defend. The jury found Killings guilty of\none count of rape, but the appellate court concluded that because of the complicity\n\fNos. 13AP-469, 13AP-521 and 13AP-595                                                    10\n\ninstruction, they could not determine what act the jury actually found him guilty of: rape,\nor that of aiding and abetting a separate rape. Thus, the court concluded that the\ncomplicity instruction was error.\n       {\u00b6 30} Here, there are no uncharged acts that Kenneth faced at trial such as in\nKillings. All three appellants faced the same charges that arose from the same conduct.\nAccordingly, Kenneth's reliance on Killings is unpersuasive.\n       {\u00b6 31} The state did not amend Kenneth's indictment. The indictment charged\nhim with a count of felonious assault and, pursuant to R.C. 2923.03(F), that indictment\nput Kenneth on notice that he also could be found complicit in the commission of that\noffense. Accordingly, we overrule Kenneth's first assignment of error.\n       C. The Sufficiency and Manifest Weight of the Evidence\n       {\u00b6 32} Kenneth's third assignment of error and William's second and third\nassignments of error each contend that their convictions were not supported by sufficient\nevidence and were against the manifest weight of the evidence. We disagree.\n       {\u00b6 33} Sufficiency of the evidence is a legal standard that tests whether the\nevidence introduced at trial is legally adequate to support a verdict. State v. Thompkins,\n78 Ohio St.3d 380, 386 (1997). Whether the evidence is legally sufficient to support a\nverdict is a question of law. Id.\n       {\u00b6 34} In determining whether the evidence is legally sufficient to support a\nconviction, \" '[t]he relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most\nfavorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential\nelements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.' \" State v. Robinson, 124 Ohio\nSt.3d 76, 2009-Ohio-5937, \u00b6 34, quoting State v. Jenks, 61 Ohio St.3d 259 (1991),\nparagraph two of the syllabus. A verdict will not be disturbed unless, after viewing the\nevidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, it is apparent that reasonable\nminds could not reach the conclusion reached by the trier of fact. State v. Treesh, 90 Ohio\nSt.3d 460, 484 (2001).\n       {\u00b6 35} In this inquiry, appellate courts do not assess whether the state's evidence is\nto be believed, but whether, if believed, the evidence admitted at trial supports the\nconviction. State v. Yarbrough, 95 Ohio St.3d 227, 2002-Ohio-2126, \u00b6 79-80 (evaluation\nof witness credibility not proper on review for sufficiency of evidence); State v. Bankston,\n\fNos. 13AP-469, 13AP-521 and 13AP-595                                                      11\n\n10th Dist. No. 08AP-668, 2009-Ohio-754, \u00b6 4 (noting that \"in a sufficiency of the evidence\nreview, an appellate court does not engage in a determination of witness credibility;\nrather, it essentially assumes the state's witnesses testified truthfully and determines if\nthat testimony satisfies each element of the crime.\").\n         {\u00b6 36} The weight of the evidence concerns the inclination of the greater amount of\ncredible evidence offered to support one side of the issue rather than the other.\nThompkins at 387. (Although there may be sufficient evidence to support a judgment, a\ncourt may nevertheless conclude that a judgment is against the manifest weight of the\nevidence. Id.)\n         {\u00b6 37} When presented with a challenge to the manifest weight of the evidence, an\nappellate court may not merely substitute its view for that of the trier of fact, but must\nreview the entire record, weigh the evidence and all reasonable inferences, consider the\ncredibility of witnesses and determine whether in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the\ntrier of fact clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the\nconviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered. Id. at 387. An appellate court\nshould reserve reversal of a conviction as being against the manifest weight of the\nevidence for only the most \" 'exceptional case in which the evidence weighs heavily against\nthe conviction.' \" Id., quoting State v. Martin, 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 175 (1st Dist.1983);\nState v. Strider-Williams, 10th Dist. No. 10AP-334, 2010-Ohio-6179, \u00b6 12.\n         {\u00b6 38} In addressing a manifest weight of the evidence argument, we are able to\nconsider the credibility of the witnesses. State v. Cattledge, 10th Dist. No. 10AP-105,\n2010-Ohio-4953, \u00b6 6.       However, in conducting our review, we are guided by the\npresumption that the jury, or the trial court in a bench trial, \" 'is best able to view the\nwitnesses and observe their demeanor, gestures and voice inflections, and use these\nobservations in weighing the credibility of the proffered testimony.' \" Id., quoting Seasons\nCoal Co., Inc. v. Cleveland, 10 Ohio St.3d 77, 80 (1984). Accordingly, we afford great\ndeference to the trier of fact's determination of witness credibility. State v. Redman, 10th\nDist. No. 10AP-654, 2011-Ohio-1894, \u00b6 26, citing State v. Jennings, 10th Dist. No. 09AP-\n70, 2009-Ohio-6840, \u00b6 55.        See also State v. DeHass, 10 Ohio St.2d 230 (1967),\nparagraph one of the syllabus (credibility determinations are primarily for the trier of\nfact).\n\fNos. 13AP-469, 13AP-521 and 13AP-595                                                    12\n\n              1. The Elements of the Convictions\n       {\u00b6 39} In order to find appellants guilty of felonious assault, the state had to prove\nthat they knowingly caused serious physical harm to another. R.C. 2903.11(A).\n              2. Appellants' Sufficiency Arguments\n       {\u00b6 40} Kenneth argues that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he was\ncomplicit or aided and abetted the others in the attack on Victor Sr. We disagree.\n       {\u00b6 41} It is not clear whether the trial court found Kenneth guilty as a principal\noffender or as an aider and abetter. Even if the trial court found him guilty of aiding and\nabetting, rather than as a principal offender, that conviction would be supported by\nsufficient evidence.\n       {\u00b6 42} R.C. 2923.03(A)(2) prohibits someone from aiding or abetting another in\ncommitting an offense. To support a conviction for complicity by aiding and abetting\npursuant to R.C. 2923.03(A)(2), the evidence must show that the defendant supported,\nassisted, encouraged, cooperated with, advised, or incited the principal in the commission\nof the crime, and that the defendant shared the criminal intent of the principal. State v.\nJohnson, 93 Ohio St.3d 240 (2001), syllabus. Such criminal intent can be inferred from\nthe presence, companionship, and conduct of the defendant before and after the offense is\ncommitted. Id. at 245. It may also be inferred from the circumstances surrounding the\ncrime. Columbus v. Bishop, 10th Dist. No. 08AP-300, 2008-Ohio-6964, \u00b6 41.\n       {\u00b6 43} Here, testimony from Vic Sr. and the other employee who saw the entire\nfight indicated that Kenneth punched Vic Sr. twice, pulled him to the ground, held him\ndown, and pinned his arms, allowing William and Kyle to hit Vic Sr. when Vic. Sr. could\nnot defend himself. Bishop at \u00b6 45 (act of holding down was sufficient, by itself, to convict\nas an aider and abetter). Viewing this evidence in the most favorable light to the state, as\nwe must, the evidence is sufficient evidence for a reasonable trier of fact to conclude that\nKenneth, at a minimum, assisted, supported, or cooperated in the assault of Vic Sr.\n       {\u00b6 44} William argues that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he knowingly\ncaused Vic Sr. serious physical harm. We disagree.\n       {\u00b6 45} R.C. 2901.22(B) provides that \"[a] person acts knowingly, regardless of his\npurpose, when he is aware that his conduct will probably cause a certain result or will\nprobably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when he is\n\fNos. 13AP-469, 13AP-521 and 13AP-595                                                    13\n\naware that such circumstances probably exist.\" State v. Ranson, 10th Dist. No. 01AP-\n1049, 2002-Ohio-2398, \u00b6 17. \" 'Knowingly' does not require the offender to have the\nspecific intent to cause a certain result. That is the definition of 'purposely.' Instead,\nwhether a person acts knowingly can only be determined, absent a defendant's admission,\nfrom all the surrounding facts and circumstances, including the doing of the act itself.\"\n(Footnote omitted.) State v. Huff, 145 Ohio App.3d 555, 563 (1st Dist.2001). \" 'The test\nfor whether a defendant acted knowingly is a subjective one, but it is decided on objective\ncriteria. * * * However, if a given result is probable, a person will be held to have acted\nknowingly to achieve it because one is charged by the law with knowledge of the\nreasonable and probable consequences of his own acts.' \" State v. Thomas, 10th Dist. No.\n02AP-778, 2003-Ohio-2199, \u00b6 75, quoting State v. McDaniel, 2d Dist. No. 16221 (May 1,\n1998).\n         {\u00b6 46} William admitted that he kicked Vic Sr. and hit him with his hand at least\ntwice. While he claims that he did so in defense of his son, such a defense presumes an\nintentional and purposeful use of force. See State v. Hubbard, 10th Dist. No. 11AP-945,\n2013-Ohio-2735, \u00b6 54. William's testimony alone is sufficient for a reasonable fact finder\nto conclude that William acted knowingly.\n               3. Appellants' Manifest Weight of the Evidence Arguments\n         {\u00b6 47} In arguing that their convictions were against the manifest weight of the\nevidence, Kenneth claims that Vic Sr.'s testimony was not credible. He notes several\npurported inconsistencies in Vic Sr.'s testimony.\n         {\u00b6 48} A defendant is not entitled to a reversal on manifest weight grounds merely\nbecause inconsistent evidence was offered at trial. State v. Campbell, 10th Dist. No. 07AP-\n1001, 2008-Ohio-4831, \u00b6 23. The trier of fact is in the best position to take into account\nthe inconsistencies in the evidence, as well as the demeanor and manner of the witnesses,\nand to determine which witnesses are more credible. State v. DeJoy, 10th Dist. No. 10AP-\n919, 2011-Ohio-2745, \u00b6 27. While appellant points to certain portions of Vic Sr.'s\ntestimony that were inconsistent with his prior descriptions of the events, these\ninconsistencies do not render the conviction against the manifest weight of the evidence.\nThe judge was aware of these inconsistencies and chose to believe Vic Sr.'s testimony\ndescribing the fight. This is within the province of the trier of fact. State v. Conkel, 10th\n\fNos. 13AP-469, 13AP-521 and 13AP-595                                                      14\n\nDist. No. 08AP-845, 2009-Ohio-2852, \u00b6 17-18; State v. Thompson, 10th Dist. No. 08AP-\n22, 2008-Ohio-4551, \u00b6 20-21. Additionally, we note that another employee who saw the\nfight provided testimony that was largely consistent with Vic Sr.'s testimony.\n       {\u00b6 49} Next, William argues that his conviction is against the manifest weight of\nthe evidence because he established that he acted in defense of his son. We disagree.\n       {\u00b6 50} Defense of family, being a variation of self-defense, is an affirmative defense\nthat the defendant has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence. R.C.\n2901.05(A); State v. Seals, 2d Dist. No. 04CA0063, 2005-Ohio-4837, \u00b6 34, citing State v.\nMartin, 21 Ohio St.3d 91 (1986). Ohio has long recognized a privilege to defend the\nmembers of one's family. Sharp v. State, 19 Ohio 379 (1850). If a person in good faith\nand upon reasonable grounds believes that his wife and family are in imminent danger of\ndeath or serious bodily harm, that person is entitled to use such reasonably necessary\nforce, even to the taking of life, to defend his wife and family as he would be entitled to use\nin defense of himself. State v. Williford, 49 Ohio St.3d 247 (1990). However, a person\nwho intervenes to help another stands in the shoes of the person whom he is aiding. If\nthat person is at fault, and therefore not entitled to use force in self-defense, the\nintervenor is not justified in using force in that person's defense. See State v. Wenger, 58\nOhio St.2d 336, 338-39 (1979).\n       {\u00b6 51} The state's version of events refutes Williams' claim that he acted in defense\nof his son.     The state's witnesses described a scene where Kenneth began the\nconfrontation by punching Vic Sr. twice in the chest. Moreover, Kenneth was holding Vic\nSr. down with his arms pinned against him while William and Kyle assaulted him. A\nconviction is not against the manifest weight of the evidence because the trier of fact\nbelieved the state's version of events over the appellant's version. State v. Webb, 10th\nDist. No. 10AP-189, 2010-Ohio-5208, \u00b6 16; Strider-Williams at \u00b6 13. The judge, as the\ntrier of fact, was free to disbelieve William's version of events and believe the state's\nversion of events. That decision was within the province of the trial judge. State v.\nWilliams, 10th Dist. No. 08AP-719, 2009-Ohio-3237, \u00b6 18-19 (jury's decision to reject\nclaim of self-defense and believe prosecution's version of events not against manifest\nweight of the evidence); Webb at \u00b6 17. Given the conflicting testimony regarding how this\nfight started and what occurred during the fight, this is not the exceptional case in which\n\fNos. 13AP-469, 13AP-521 and 13AP-595                                                     15\n\nthe evidence weighs heavily against the conviction. Seals at \u00b6 47-48 (trial court did not\nlose its way in rejecting claim of self-defense).\n       {\u00b6 52} Given the conflicting testimony presented, we cannot say that the trial court\nclearly lost its way and created a manifest miscarriage of justice. The judge simply\nbelieved the version of events presented by the state's witnesses and disbelieved\nappellants' version of events. This was within the province of the judge as the trier of fact.\nAccordingly, appellants' convictions are not against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n       {\u00b6 53} Appellants' convictions for felonious assault are supported by sufficient\nevidence and are not against the manifest weight of the evidence.           Accordingly, we\noverrule Kenneth's third assignment of error and William's second and third assignments\nof error.\n       D. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n       {\u00b6 54} Each appellant raises certain claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. To\nestablish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, appellant must show that counsel's\nperformance was deficient and that counsel's deficient performance prejudiced him.\nState v. Jackson, 107 Ohio St.3d 53, 2005-Ohio-5981, \u00b6 133, citing Strickland v.\nWashington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984). The failure to make either showing defeats a\nclaim of ineffective assistance of counsel. State v. Bradley, 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 143 (1989),\nquoting Strickland at 697. (\"[T]here is no reason for a court deciding an ineffective\nassistance claim to approach the inquiry in the same order or even to address both\ncomponents of the inquiry if the defendant makes an insufficient showing on one.\").\n       {\u00b6 55} In order to show counsel's performance was deficient, the appellant must\nprove that counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonable\nrepresentation. Jackson at \u00b6 133. The appellant must overcome the strong presumption\nthat defense counsel's conduct falls within a wide range of reasonable professional\nassistance. Strickland at 689. To show prejudice, the appellant must establish that there\nis a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the\nproceeding would have been different. State v. Hale, 119 Ohio St.3d 118, 2008-Ohio-\n3426, \u00b6 204.\n\fNos. 13AP-469, 13AP-521 and 13AP-595                                                     16\n\n              1. Plea Negotiations and Lafler v. Cooper\n       {\u00b6 56} In William's first assignment of error and in Kyle and Kenneth's fourth\nassignments of error, all three appellants attempt to raise ineffective assistance of counsel\nclaims under Lafler v. Cooper, __ U.S. __, 132 S.Ct. 1376 (2012). In that case, and the\nrelated case of Missouri v. Frye, __ U.S. __, 132 S.Ct. 1399 (2012), the United States\nSupreme Court held that the Sixth Amendment's right to effective assistance of counsel\nextends to the plea bargaining process. Lafler at 1384.\n       {\u00b6 57} In their assignments of error, however, appellants do not allege that their\ntrial counsel acted deficiently in the plea bargaining process. Instead, they seek a remand\nof this matter for the trial court to hold a hearing to determine whether the state offered a\nplea bargain that trial counsel did not communicate to them. Because appellants fail to\nallege, let alone demonstrate, error, we have no reason to remand the matter.\n              2. Appellants' Claims of Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n       {\u00b6 58} Kenneth and Kyle, in their second and fifth assignments of error,\nrespectively, assert other claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.\n       {\u00b6 59} Kenneth specifically argues that his trial counsel was ineffective for not\nmoving for a judgment of acquittal after the state's opening argument.            Kenneth is\nmistaken. Trial counsel did move for a judgment of acquittal after the state's opening\nargument, which the trial court denied. (Tr. 27.)\n       {\u00b6 60} Kyle asserts a number of instances of alleged ineffective conduct by his\ncounsel. First, he argues that trial counsel deficiently failed to file a motion to sever his\ntrial from his co-defendants. We have already concluded that appellants did not have\nantagonistic defenses.     Therefore, a motion to sever would have been meritless.\nTherefore, trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to file a motion to sever. State v.\nKelley, 179 Ohio App.3d 666, 2008-Ohio-6598, \u00b6 76 (7th Dist.); State v. Simms, 10th Dist.\nNo. 10AP-1063, 2012-Ohio-2321, \u00b6 49.\n       {\u00b6 61} Second, Kyle appears to argue that counsel was ineffective for allowing him\nto waive his right to a jury trial. The record demonstrates, as noted above, that Kyle's\nchoice to waive his right to a jury trial was voluntary and that the trial court fulfilled its\nobligation to ensure that his choice was voluntary. This defeats any claim of alleged\n\fNos. 13AP-469, 13AP-521 and 13AP-595                                                    17\n\nineffective assistance of counsel with respect to the jury waiver. State v. Webb, 10th Dist.\nNo. 10AP-289, 2010-Ohio-6122, \u00b6 70-72.\n       {\u00b6 62} Third, Kyle argues that trial counsel acted deficiently by not interviewing a\nwitness and not securing his presence at trial. Even assuming this was deficient conduct,\nKyle cannot demonstrate that he was prejudiced. He speculates without any evidentiary\nsupport that this witness's testimony would have been important. It is pure speculation to\nconclude that the result of his trial would have been different had the additional witness\ntestified. Williams at \u00b6 35, citing State v. Thorne, 5th Dist. No. 2003CA00388, 2004-\nOhio-7055, \u00b6 70 (failure to show prejudice without affidavit describing testimony of\nwitnesses not called); State v. Stalnaker, 5th Dist. No. 21731, 2004-Ohio-1236, \u00b6 9. This\ntype of vague speculation is insufficient to establish ineffective assistance of counsel.\nState v. Wiley, 10th Dist. No. 03AP-340, 2004-Ohio-1008, \u00b6 30.\n       {\u00b6 63} Lastly, Kyle argues that trial counsel deficiently questioned Vic. Sr. during\nhis cross-examination by not asking him about allegedly inconsistent statements he made\nin a pre-trial deposition. We disagree. The scope of cross-examination clearly falls within\nthe ambit of trial strategy, and debatable trial tactics do not establish ineffective\nassistance of counsel. State v. Hoffner, 102 Ohio St.3d 358, 2004-Ohio-3430, \u00b6 45, citing\nState v. Campbell, 90 Ohio St.3d 320, 339 (2000).\n       {\u00b6 64} Each of the appellants has failed to demonstrate ineffective assistance of\ncounsel.
