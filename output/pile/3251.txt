She finds it challenging to take care of him with the limited number of customers that now find her attractive. Debu, a not-so-successful lyricist, is dumped by his boyfriend, and is out on streets. These characters, in need of money and love, bump into each other, after which their lives take a similar direction. Their relationships, born out of mutual needs, change their perceptions about each other, which in turn brings a change in them -- finally, a sunny day after days of merciless downpour.\n\nProduction\nThere are many sequences in this movie which are shot in the rain, during the Bombay monsoons, with  Kiran Deohans of Jodha Akbar fame taking charge as the cinematographer. The music score is by Sandesh Shandilya, except the title song, which was done by Gulzar. The screenplay was written by Deepti Naval in three months.\n\nCritical reception\nThis art film premiered at the market section of 2009 Cannes Film Festival, and got a positive response.\n\nThis movie is Manisha Koirala's comeback movie, in a very sensitive role, said to be inspired by a real story.\n\nThe film was screened at the 2010 edition of Chicago South Asian Film Festival. Gapers Block gave a moderate rating, calling the plot unoriginal, comparing it to an \"elongated episode of Will & Grace\". The representation of Debu, who is semi-closeted, was also criticised, for its stereotyped gay characteristics. while ImagineIndia was of the opinion that,\"...characters do not appear stereotypical, but a modern, sensitive and realistic portrait of people struggling to find happiness, with the ebbs and tides of human relationships\" The film was screened in the competition section of ImagineIndia film festival (2010).\n\nThe movie was slated to release commercially on 8 March 2012 in India but was postponed.\nIt has been released on Netflix in September 2019.\n A review in The Citizen called the film \"niche\" while praising the performances of three principal characters stating, \"But the cream and the cake go to the three actors\".\n\nAccolades\n2009-Best Feature Film -The Indian Film Festival of Houston\n2010-Best Screenplay - The New York Indian Film Festival (MIAAC)\n2010-Best Actor - Rajit Kapoor at ImagineIndia film festival (2010)\n\n Official Selection\n Special Screening venue Cannes Film Festival, 2009\n The Indian Film Festival of Houston, 2009\n Chicago South Asian Film Festival, 2010 (Opening film)\n The New York Indian Film Festival (MIAAC), 2010\n ImagineIndia Film Festival, Spain 2010\n Seattle South Asian Film Festival, 2011 (Opening film)\n India International Film Festival, Tampa Bay, USA, 2012\n First Annual Washington DC South Asian Film Festival, 2012\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nOfficial website\nFacebook page\n\nCategory:2009 direct-to-video films\nCategory:2000s Hindi-language films\nCategory:Gay-related_films\nCategory:Indian films\nCategory:Indian LGBT-related films\nCategory:Directorial debut films\nCategory:Indian direct-to-video films"
