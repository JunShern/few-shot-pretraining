    "text": "Introduction {#s1}\n============\n\nArticular cartilage is a highly specialised connective tissue in joints. Its main function is to provide a smooth, lubricated surface for articulation and to take up and distribute high loads. Its remarkable dimensional stability and mechanical properties are due to the composition of its extracellular matrix. The load-bearing function is based on the high osmotic pressure created by negatively charged glycosaminoglycans, which are predominantly aggrecan molecules. In addition, the fibrillar collagen network, mainly composed of type II collagen, provides the tissue with its tensile resistance. As the only cell type in articular cartilage, chondrocytes are entirely responsible for maintaining the metabolic balance of matrix proteins. Accordingly, it has been shown that mechanical forces affect chondrocyte metabolic activity (for a review, see [@pone.0036964-Grodzinsky1]). More precisely, *ex vivo* and *in vitro* models of chondrocyte mechanobiology have generally shown that static compression inhibits the expression of cartilage matrix proteins whereas dynamic compression regimens enhance them [@pone.0036964-Buschmann1]--[@pone.0036964-Jones1].\n\nIn this context, mechanotransduction is the molecular process by which cells convert mechanical force into biochemical signalling. Little is currently known regarding the sequence of biochemical events that are involved in mechanotransduction and that eventually result in the modulation of the chondrocyte phenotype. It is therefore necessary to assess the signalling and regulatory pathways activated during mechanical signal transduction in chondrocytes. In this study, we employed microarray analysis to investigate the overall changes in chondrocyte gene expression in response to dynamic compression. We used a cell model system consisting of isolated mouse chondrocytes embedded within an agarose hydrogel. We have previously used these constructs to develop experimental procedures to analyse the effects of compression at the mRNA level (using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction experiments) and to determine the phosphorylation state of signalling molecules (using Western blotting) [@pone.0036964-Bougault1], [@pone.0036964-Bougault2]. Here, our study was designed to identify candidate genes involved in the early response of chondrocytes to compression.\n\n![Chondrocytes embedded in agarose gel maintain a well-differentiated phenotype.\\\nExpression of extracellular matrix proteins, integrins and the Sox9 transcription factor were analysed on Western blots of chondrocytes cultured in 3D for 3 days (d3) or 6 days (d6). The presence or absence patterns of proteins at day 6 are representative of 3 independent experiments. A: Type II (Col II) and type IX (Col IX) collagens accumulate and become cross-linked by day 6. Procollagen II forms (pro) and mature collagen II chains \\[\u03b11(II)\\] are present. Beta (\u03b2) indicates cross-linked \u03b11(II) dimers. Collagen IX chains \\[\u03b11(IX)\\] are present. Asterisks (\\*) indicate cross-linked collagens. B: Type I collagen (Col I) and \u03b111 integrin (Itg\u03b111) are not or only faintly detected, whereas the chondrocyte-specific \u03b110 integrin (Itg\u03b110) is present at day 6. Passaged chondrocytes cultured in monolayer were used as positive controls (Ctrl) for Col I and \u03b111 integrin immunorevelations. Procollagen I (pro) and mature collagen I chains \u03b11(I) and \u03b12(I) are indicated. C: Sox9 chondrogenic transcription factor increases with the duration of culture.](pone.0036964.g001){#pone-0036964-g001}\n\nTaken together, the results presented here indicate that the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the transforming growth factor (TGF)- \u03b2 pathways are involved in the early response of chondrocytes to dynamic compression. The microarray analysis revealed that only 20 transcripts were modulated more than 2-fold. At a fold modulation threshold of 1.4, an extended list of candidate genes included 325 candidate mechanosensitive genes, of which 85% were down-regulated. This global down-regulation may indicate a general control mechanism for a rapid response to dynamic compression. Many of the observed modulated genes are known to be mechanosensitive in other biological contexts. In addition, modulation of genes or transcripts involved in various aspects of cellular physiology was observed. Our integrated analysis provides new molecular insight into how chondrocytes respond to mechanical forces.\n\n![Experimental design and dynamic compression profile.\\\nChondrocytes cultured in agarose for 6 days underwent dynamic compression using the FX-4000C Flexercell Compression Plus System (Flexcell International). Chondrocyte-agarose constructs underwent cyclical compression ranging from 20 kPa to 40 kPa at a frequency of 0.5 Hz for 5, 15 or 30 min. Signalling proteins were analysed by Western blot at each of the three time points. DNA microarray analysis was performed to compare 30 min-compression constructs to uncompressed constructs.](pone.0036964.g002){#pone-0036964-g002}\n\nResults {#s2}\n=======\n\nMaintenance of the chondrocyte phenotype and cartilage-characteristic matrix deposition in an agarose hydrogel {#s2a}\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo investigate the early effects of dynamic compression on gene expression of fully differentiated chondrocytes, we used a previously described cell model system [@pone.0036964-Bougault1], [@pone.0036964-Bougault2]. Briefly, mouse chondrocytes were embedded in agarose just after their isolation from cartilage and these chondrocyte-agarose constructs were cultured for 6 days to allow extracellular matrix deposition. Under these conditions, chondrocytes are viable and their proliferation was confirmed by an increase in DNA content (about 1.5 fold, data not shown). Furthermore, they maintain their round morphology and type II collagen and aggrecan accumulate at the cell periphery [@pone.0036964-Bougault1], [@pone.0036964-Bougault2]. Western blotting was used to obtain more detailed information on the matrix proteins and integrin receptors present in the chondrocyte-agarose constructs just before application of dynamic compression ([Figure 1](#pone-0036964-g001){ref-type=\"fig\"}).\n\n![Smad2, but not Smad1/5/8 or FAK, is activated by compression in chondrocyte-agarose constructs.\\\nChondrocytes cultured in agarose for 6 days underwent dynamic compression (+) or were not compressed (\u2212) for the indicated times and the phosphorylation levels of FAK, Smad2 and Smad1/5/8 were analysed on Western blots. (A) Representative blots. (B) For FAK phosphorylation, densitometric analysis was performed on three (5 and 15 min) or two (30 min) independent experiments. For SMAD phosphorylation, densitometric analysis was performed on four (5 and 15 min) or three (30 min) independent experiments. For each protein, the ratio of the phospho-protein to the total protein was calculated and the value obtained for mechanically-induced phosphorylation was normalised to uncompressed controls. Bars represent the compression-induced phosphorylation modulation (mean +/\u2212 SD), with up-regulation in red and down-regulation in green (\\*\\* p\\<0.01).](pone.0036964.g003){#pone-0036964-g003}\n\nAs expected, after 3 days of culture, chondrocytes synthesised type II collagen, but mainly in the procollagen form ([Figure 1](#pone-0036964-g001){ref-type=\"fig\"} Panel A). Fibrillar collagens such as type II collagen are synthesised as precursor forms that must be cleaved to produce the mature triple helical collagens capable of packing into fibrils (for a review, see [@pone.0036964-Canty1]). After 6 days of culture, mature-form type II collagen was the predominant form and showed interchain covalent cross-links ([Figure 1](#pone-0036964-g001){ref-type=\"fig\"} Panel A). All the enzymes necessary for the post-translational maturation of collagen were therefore active in the 3D scaffolds. In addition, we investigated type IX collagen, which is a minor non-fibrillar collagen present in hyaline cartilage. Western blot analysis confirmed the presence of covalent cross-links between collagen molecules in the chondrocyte-agarose constructs after 6 days of culture ([Figure 1](#pone-0036964-g001){ref-type=\"fig\"} Panel A). To demonstrate the absence of critical proteins that could cause the chondrocytes to transduce mechanical signals in a non-characteristic way, we looked for type I collagen, the classical marker of fibroblasts and dedifferentiated chondrocytes. No type I collagen was detected in Western blots on the chondrocyte-agarose constructs, but it was detected in the positive controls, i.e. extracts of mouse chondrocytes cultured in monolayer ([Figure 1](#pone-0036964-g001){ref-type=\"fig\"} Panel B). Therefore, before the compression experiments, chondrocytes synthesise mature and cross-linked extracellular matrix components that are part of the typical collagen network in cartilage.\n\n![Identification of major candidate mechanosensitive genes.\\\nGene expression levels of compressed samples were compared to uncompressed controls. (A) DNA microarray analysis was performed on four independent pairs of uncompressed/compressed experiments. Expression level differences were sorted to identify highly responsive genes (fold change \\>2), resulting in a list of 20 transcripts. Bars represent the fold change in gene expression upon compression, i.e. up-regulation (red) or down-regulation (green) (p\\<0.01). Exact modulation factors and associated p-values are detailed in [Table 1](#pone-0036964-t001){ref-type=\"table\"}. (B) Real-time PCR analysis on three independent experiments confirmed DNA microarray results for eight selected genes. Bars represent the compression-induced gene expression modulation (mean +/\u2212 SD), either up-regulation (red) or down-regulation (green) (\\* p\\<0.05, \\*\\* p\\<0.01).](pone.0036964.g004){#pone-0036964-g004}\n\nIntegrin transmembrane receptors connect the extracellular matrix to the intracellular cytoskeletal network and are expected to play an important role in cellular responses to mechanical forces. The main collagen-binding integrin on chondrocytes in cartilage is \u03b110\u03b21 integrin, whereas \u03b111\u03b21 integrin is more characteristic of mesenchymal tissues. Thus, \u03b110 and \u03b111 are good markers for evaluating the status of the chondrocyte phenotype [@pone.0036964-Gouttenoire1]. Integrins, probably along with other surface proteins, were removed from the cell surface after enzymatic isolation of chondrocytes from cartilage ([Figure 1](#pone-0036964-g001){ref-type=\"fig\"} Panel B). \u03b110 was re-expressed at the end of the culture period in agarose, whereas \u03b111 could only be faintly detected. We also monitored another differentiation marker: Sox9, a transcription factor required for cartilage formation ([Figure 1](#pone-0036964-g001){ref-type=\"fig\"} Panel C). In mouse chondrocytes, high levels of Sox9 protein correlate with type II collagen synthesis and a well-differentiated phenotype, whereas dedifferentiated as well as hypertrophic chondrocytes lack Sox9 [@pone.0036964-Lefebvre1]. Thus, after a 6 day culture period, robust Sox9 expression together with \u03b110 integrin expression further confirmed that chondrocytes were highly differentiated.\n\n10.1371/journal.pone.0036964.t001\n\n###### Results from DNA microarray analysis: gene expression levels in compressed samples were compared to uncompressed control samples (fold change \\>2 and p-value \\>0.01).\n\n![](pone.0036964.t001){#pone-0036964-t001-1}\n\n  RNA ID       PROTEIN ID                                     GENE NAME                                      FOLD CHANGE   ADJUSTED P-VALUE\n  ----------- ------------ -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------- ------------------\n                                                        **UP-REGULATED GENES**                                            \n  NM_010234      Q6PCX9                            Proto-oncogene protein c-fos;Fos                             9.27            2E-04\n  NM_007913      Q9WVQ1                          Early growth response protein 1;Egr1                           3.90            1E-04\n  NM_010444      Q9DBG7                  Nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 1;Nr4a1                    2.84            4E-04\n  NM_010499      P17950                      Immediate early response gene 2 protein;Ier2                       2.63            2E-05\n  NM_010118      Q9JLB2                          Early growth response protein 2;Egr2                           2.60            6E-03\n  NM_007570      Q04211                                   Protein BTG2;Btg2                                     2.28            5E-04\n  NM_010591      Q6SJQ0                             Transcription factor AP-1;Jun                               2.27            1E-02\n  NM_008036      P46935                                   Protein fosB;Fosb                                     2.16            4E-03\n  NM_008416      Q61136                            Transcription factor jun-B;Junb                              2.00            8E-04\n                                                       **DOWN-REGULATED GENES**                                           \n  NM_175284      Q149J3                               Frizzled homolog 10;Fzd10                                 0.28            7E-07\n  NM_030696      Q8BL66                         Monocarboxylate transporter 4;Slc16a3                           0.31            2E-05\n  NM_027864      Q61468                Polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 14;Galnt14                 0.36            3E-05\n  NM_026358      Q8VI64                           Ovary-specific acidic protein;Osap                            0.38            8E-06\n  NM_138741      Q9D994                        Serum deprivation-response protein;Sdpr                          0.40            2E-03\n  AJ293625      Q9D8T7\\*         SRA stem-loop-interacting RNA-binding protein (mitochondrial);Slirp            0.41            4E-06\n  AK020134                  Metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (non-coding RNA);Malat1      0.41            1E-03\n  AK032986       Q8BQ86                         WD repeat-containing protein 60;Wdr60                           0.46            7E-03\n  NM_023190      Q11011             Apoptotic chromatin condensation inducer in the nucleus;Acin1               0.47            3E-04\n  NM_018857      Q70KY4                             Mesothelin, cleaved form;Msln                               0.48            7E-05\n  NM_146112      Q6Y7W8            PERQ amino acid-rich with GYF domain-containing protein 2;Gigyf2             0.50            3E-03\n\nIn conclusion, the chondrocytes in our agarose model system were well-differentiated and did synthesise mature, cross-linked extracellular matrix components as well as integrins, before we applied dynamic compression.\n\n![Analysis of the candidate mechanosensitive gene list.\\\nGene expression levels of compressed samples were compared to uncompressed controls.

We therefore investigated MAPK activation in the chondrocyte-agarose constructs to select the appropriate duration of dynamic compression for the characterisation of mechanotransduction events. Chondrocyte-agarose constructs underwent dynamic compression for 5, 15 or 30 min ([Figure 2](#pone-0036964-g002){ref-type=\"fig\"}) and Western blots were used to examine phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2 and p38. ERK1/2 phosphorylation was observed primarily after 15 min of compression (average 2-fold increase when compared to uncompressed samples) but high variability in the phosphorylation rates impaired the statistical significance of the results ([Data S1](#pone.0036964.s001){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). Following 5 min of compression, p38 phosphorylation stimulation was low but highly reproducible (p\\<0.05). After 15 min, this activation seemed stronger (3-fold induction), but again, the response was highly variable ([Data S1](#pone.0036964.s001){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}).\n\n10.1371/journal.pone.0036964.t002\n\n###### Primers used for real-time PCR analysis (reference gene: *Rpl13a*).\n\n![](pone.0036964.t002){#pone-0036964-t002-2}\n\n  GENE NAME    PRIMER SEQUENCE  \n  ----------- ----------------- ----------------------------\n  *Rpl13a*            S             atccctccaccctatgacaa\n                     AS             gccccaggtaagcaaactt\n  *Fos*               S            gggacagcctttcctactacc\n                     AS             gatctgcgcaaaagtcctgt\n  *Egr1*              S             ccctatgagcacctgaccac\n                     AS             tcgtttggctgggataactc\n  *Nr4a1*             S              ctgtccgctctggtcctc\n                     AS             aatgcgattctgcagctctt\n  *Ier2*              S            ttgaatctcagggtcgaactc\n                     AS             ggtagtgaaacggccttgaa\n  *Btg2*              S             gcgagcagagactcaaggtt\n                     AS            ccagtggtgtttgtaatgatcg\n  *Jun*               S             agggacccatggaagttttt\n                     AS          tttttctaggagttgtcagattcaaa\n  *Fzd10*             S             tgctgcctgtgcataaactt\n                     AS             cccccaggaaagctctttag\n  *Galnt14*           S             tactatgcagctcggccttt\n                     AS             caggttcagcctgttctcaa\n\nFocal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase whose phosphorylation is generally detected within minutes after application of mechanical strain in a variety of cell types, including chondrocytes [@pone.0036964-Lee1].

Mechanical stimulation promoted Smad2 phosphorylation, mainly after 5 and 15 min of dynamic compression, whereas there were no differences in the phosphorylation levels of Smad1/5/8 between compressed and uncompressed samples ([Figure 3](#pone-0036964-g003){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Results from four independent experiments revealed the relatively high intensity (2.5-fold induction) and the great reproducibility (p\\<0.01) of this early event of Smad2 activation ([Figure 3](#pone-0036964-g003){ref-type=\"fig\"}).\n\nFinally, the time-dependent activation of the MAPK and canonical TGF-\u03b2/Smad pathways demonstrated that the compression regimen we applied to our chondrocyte-agarose model system was sufficient to trigger a cellular response at the molecular level. These pathways, independently or in synergy, may induce changes in the expression of genes that are important in the early responses of chondrocytes to mechanical signals.\n\nConfirmation of the mechanosensitive character of members of the AP-1 transcription factor family and *Egr1* {#s2c}\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNext, we undertook a microarray analysis to detect gene expression modulation in response to 30 min of dynamic compression. Observed gene expression regulation was thus putatively downstream the activation of the MAPK and TGF-\u03b2/Smad pathways observed after only 15 min of compression. An extensive microarray analysis was performed on four independent pairs of compressed and uncompressed experiments. We focused on highly responsive genes: a 2-fold change threshold for up- and down-regulation was applied (p\\<0.01). Of the 20 transcripts with a difference of 2-fold or more, 9 transcripts corresponded to up-regulated genes and 11 to down-regulated genes ([Table 1](#pone-0036964-t001){ref-type=\"table\"} and [Figure 4](#pone-0036964-g004){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Interestingly, 8 of the up-regulated genes were known transcription factors. The most responsive gene was *Fos*, with a compression-induced over-expression of about 9-fold (p\\<0.001) and *Egr1* showed a compression-induced up-regulation of about 4-fold (p\\<0.001). Furthermore, the concomitant stimulation of *Jun, Junb* and *Fosb*, which are all genes coding for members of the AP-1 transcription factor family, and *Egr1* has also been reported to occur as an early event in diverse models of compression for skeletal cells [@pone.0036964-Fitzgerald1]--[@pone.0036964-Papachristou1].\n\nIdentification of new candidate mechanosensitive genes {#s2d}\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn addition to those mentioned above, genes showing a difference of 2-fold or more with a p-value of less than 0.01 are listed in [Table 1](#pone-0036964-t001){ref-type=\"table\"} ([Figure 4](#pone-0036964-g004){ref-type=\"fig\"}, Panel A). Regarding the up-regulated transcription factor-encoding genes, *Egr2* and *Btg2* are members of the early growth response gene family and *Nr4a1* encodes a nuclear receptor. The last up-regulated gene in the list was *Ier2*, another early gene inducible by growth factors. Therefore, all up-regulated genes in this list are already known as \"immediate early genes\".\n\nThe list of the down-regulated genes appeared more diversified. *Slc16a3*, *Galnt14*, *Osap* and *Slirp* code for proteins involved in cell metabolism, *Acin1* and *Msln* are genes related to cell death, *Sdpr/Cavin-2* encodes a caveolar protein, *Malat1* corresponds to a non-coding RNA and *Fzd10* and *Gigyf2* encode signalling molecules. No information is available in databanks on the predicted protein encoded by *Wdr60*.\n\nTo validate the expression profiles obtained by microarray analysis, real-time PCR was used to compare the mRNA expression levels in compressed and control chondrocytes. We examined eight genes and confirmed the same gene expression modulation pattern as the microarray analysis ([Figure 4](#pone-0036964-g004){ref-type=\"fig\"}, panel B). These observations indicated that our experimental procedure reliably identified putative mechanosensitive genes.\n\nIn addition, the microarray analysis revealed many other candidate mechanosensitive genes when the fold change threshold was lowered from 2 to 1.4 (p\\<0.01, [Data S2](#pone.0036964.s002){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). This extended dataset included 325 genes, with 48 up-regulated (i.e. 15%) and 277 down-regulated genes (i.e. 85%). The early response of chondrocytes to compression is thus generally characterised by down-regulation of gene expression ([Figure 5](#pone-0036964-g005){ref-type=\"fig\"} Panel A).\n\nThe presence of numerous transcription factors on the short list of highly responsive genes suggests that our cell model system was suitable for exploring the early events of mechanotransduction. We sought to further confirm this hypothesis by using the extended dataset of mechanosensitive genes. Hence, we analysed this extended list using PANTHER classification system to cluster candidate genes into relevant categories regarding signal transduction. From the extended dataset, 212 coding transcripts were eligible for functional annotation, of which 41 were up-regulated and 171 were down-regulated proteins ([Data S3](#pone.0036964.s003){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). Transcription factors were the most over-represented class of proteins (36 proteins, p\\<0.001) and when pooled with DNA-, RNA- and nucleic acid-binding proteins (63 proteins), they represented 30% of the modulated proteins detected here ([Figure 5](#pone-0036964-g005){ref-type=\"fig\"} Panel B). In addition, 20 proteins belonged to the protein class grouping kinases, phosphatases and kinase regulators, and 25 proteins belonged to the protein class grouping receptors and receptor-binding proteins ([Figure 5](#pone-0036964-g005){ref-type=\"fig\"} Panel B and [Data S4](#pone.0036964.s004){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). Since these data strongly suggest that chondrocytes are involved in signal transduction mechanisms, the dataset of the 212 functionally annotated proteins was further analysed using the PANTHER and Pathway Express systems to identify over-represented signalling pathways. Several signalling pathways, such as Wnt, TGF-\u03b2, or MAPK pathways, were prominent, although statistical support was modest (data not shown). Altogether, our results demonstrate the relevance of the extended list of modulated genes for identifying new actors or targets involved in chondrocyte mechanotransduction.\n\nDiscussion {#s3}\n==========\n\nValidation of the chondrocyte-agarose construct as a model for identifying the mechanosensitive response typical of chondrocytes {#s3a}\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe aim of this study was to explore the molecular-level response of chondrocytes to dynamic compression using a model system we previously developed [@pone.0036964-Bougault1], [@pone.0036964-Bougault2]. Because sensing and response to external mechanical stimuli by cells is controlled by cell-matrix interactions, we carefully examined --- before performing the compression experiments --- the extracellular matrix proteins and cellular receptors synthesised by chondrocytes in agarose. Western blot analysis extended our previous immunohistochemistry studies [@pone.0036964-Bougault1], [@pone.0036964-Bougault2] and confirmed that chondrocytes produced a cartilage-characteristic matrix during the pre-culture period. Regarding type II and type IX collagen production, the presence of cross-links in the newly formed matrix indicated that these chondrocytes were able to synthesise enzymes necessary for proper maturation and stabilisation of collagen molecules and their packing into collagen fibrils. In addition, in our model system, chondrocytes expressed the collagen-binding integrin \u03b110 [@pone.0036964-Camper1]. Therefore, the chondrocyte-agarose model system used in this study made it possible to examine the molecular events underlying mechanotransduction, which probably occur during typical chondrocyte-cartilage matrix interactions.\n\nSince chondrocyte response to mechanical stimulation is affected if chondrocytes dedifferentiate prior to compression [@pone.0036964-Wiseman1], [@pone.0036964-Das1], we also carefully examined the chondrocyte phenotype in our model system. Western blot analysis of type I, II and IX collagens, \u03b110 and \u03b111 integrins and Sox9 extends our previous studies [@pone.0036964-Bougault1], [@pone.0036964-Bougault2] and confirmed that chondrocytes maintain a well-differentiated phenotype in our model system. Agarose hydrogel cultures have already been used to enhance chondrocytes in other models [@pone.0036964-Benya1], [@pone.0036964-Aydelotte1]; the challenge here was to use freshly isolated mouse cells and to obtain a complete differentiated phenotype after one week of culture.\n\nSuitability of our model system for studying the early events of mechanotransduction {#s3b}\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the chondrocyte-agarose constructs, the levels of phospho-FAK were not significantly different in compressed compared to uncompressed cells, contradicting numerous published results showing a rapid activation of FAK following various mechanical stimuli. One possible explanation is that, in contrast to our chondrocyte-agarose constructs, cells where not embedded in a 3D environment. It is well known that cells in 3D systems form matrix adhesions that are not the same as their 2D counterparts [@pone.0036964-Wozniak1].\n\nWe detected transient activation of ERK1/2 and p38 in response to mechanical stress, as expected from previous studies [@pone.0036964-Fanning1]--[@pone.0036964-Hung1]. We also found that *Fos* and *Jun* family members and *Egr-1* gene expressions were activated after 30 min of compression, shortly after the primary activation of the MAPK pathway. These results are very consistent since *Fos*, *Jun* and *Egr-1* are downstream targets of the MAPK pathway activated by compression in chondrocytes [@pone.0036964-DeCroos2], [@pone.0036964-Papachristou2]. In addition to *Fos*, *Fosb*, *Jun* and *Junb*, the *Atf3* gene was also stimulated 1.47-fold by compression ([Data S2](#pone.0036964.s002){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). This modulation is in good agreement with the modulation observed for AP-1 genes since Atf3, a transcription factor known to be induced in stress responses, forms heteromers with Jun members for its transcriptional activities [@pone.0036964-Hai1].\n\nOverall, the microarray analysis revealed that very few gene expression levels were modulated more than 2-fold, suggesting that dynamic compression triggered modest regulatory events. All the up-regulated genes in this list are already known as \"immediate early genes\". Examination of the very early events of dynamic compression reduces the risk of interpreting the result of feedback signalling. The presence of numerous transcription factors among the 20 most responsive genes was consistent with a high frequency of genes with a \\>1.4-fold change in expression that code for proteins linked to signal transduction and gene expression regulation. These results further demonstrate that our model system is useful for studying mechanotransduction early events.\n\nCharacteristic TGF-\u03b2 signalling is activated by dynamic compression {#s3c}\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOnly a few studies have reported activation of TGF-\u03b2/Smad signalling as an early event in cellular mechanotransduction. Osteoblasts and the Saos-2 osteoblastic cell line respond to mechanical stimulation by increasing the activation of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor substrates, Smad1/5 [@pone.0036964-Mitsui1]--[@pone.0036964-Kido1]. Likewise, Smad2/3 phosphorylation increases when umbilical cord progenitor cells are stretched [@pone.0036964-Turner1]. Regarding chondrocytes, only one immunohistochemistry study has shown Smad2/3 activation in specific regions of bovine articular cartilage subjected to 5 min of shear stress [@pone.0036964-Neu1]. In our study, a Western blot analysis showed that Smad2, but not Smad1/5/8, was activated by dynamic compression, thus confirming that activation of TGF-\u03b2/Smad signalling represents an early response of chondrocytes to mechanical loading.\n\nChondrocytes cultured in agarose gel secrete TGF-\u03b2 [@pone.0036964-Tschan1] and this protein is secreted by various cells --- including chondrocytes --- as part of a latent complex that associates with matrix proteins such as fibrillin, proteoglycans, and fibronectin [@pone.0036964-Chaudhry1]--[@pone.0036964-Hyytiainen1]. One component of the latent complex, the latency-associated protein, interacts directly with integrins, especially \u03b1v\u03b25. Myofibroblasts cultured on stiff matrices can exert tension on the latent complex through integrins, causing conformational changes and the release of sequestered TGF-\u03b2 in an active form [@pone.0036964-Wells1]. Although we did not measure the release of active TGF-\u03b2, it is possible that dynamic compression on chondrocyte-agarose constructs causes the mechanically driven release of soluble TGF-\u03b2 which then binds to its receptor and subsequently triggers signalling as exemplified by Smad2 phosphorylation.\n\nRegardless of the exact mechanism of TGF-\u03b2 activation in our cell model system, the microarray analysis confirmed the involvement of TGF-\u03b2 signalling in the chondrocyte response to dynamic compression. For instance, *Htra1*, a gene coding for a serine protease that inhibits TGF-\u03b2 signalling [@pone.0036964-Oka1] and *Arkadia/Rnf111*, a gene coding for an ubiquitin ligase involved in Smad2/3 regulation [@pone.0036964-Mavrakis1], were down-regulated under dynamic compression (1.47-fold and 1.66-fold, respectively, [Data S2](#pone.0036964.s002){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). Moreover, *Cyr61* was up-regulated by 1.64-fold. *Cyr61* is an important regulator of chondrogenesis and a member of the CCN family that includes connective tissue growth factor (Ctgf) [@pone.0036964-Wong1]. *Cyr61*, like *Ctgf*, is up-regulated in fibroblasts cultured under mechanical stress within a 3D collagen gel [@pone.0036964-Schild1]. Because *Cyr61* expression is activated as an early response to TGF-\u03b2 [@pone.0036964-Brunner1], it is possible that the observed *Cyr61* up-regulation results, at least in part, from the activation of TGF-\u03b2 signalling triggered by dynamic compression. Clearly, the interplay between growth factors, growth factor signalling and mechanotransduction is highly complex.\n\nDynamic compression induces a general down-regulation of gene expression in chondrocytes {#s3d}\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe microarray analysis revealed that around 85% of the 325 mechanosensitive identified genes were down-regulated. One possible explanation for the observed trend towards a reduction in RNA levels is an increase in mRNA decay. Interestingly, two genes coding for major proteins involved in RNA degradation, *Btg2* and *Zfp36*, were one of the relatively few genes up-regulated following dynamic compression (2.28-fold and 1.76-fold, respectively, [Data S2](#pone.0036964.s002){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). Btg2, a member of the Btg/Tob family of proteins, is a general activator of mRNA decay [@pone.0036964-Mauxion1], and Zfp36 binds to unstable mRNA and promotes their degradation [@pone.0036964-Clement1]. Zfp36 has been proposed as an inducible attenuator of growth factor signalling, by promoting degradation of rapidly induced genes and thus restricting the cell\\'s responsiveness to stimulation [@pone.0036964-Amit1]. Btg/Tob factors are thought to facilitate the rapid switch to a new gene expression program by speeding up the degradation of previously made mRNAs [@pone.0036964-Mauxion1]. For example, Btg2 activates BMP signalling [@pone.0036964-Park1]. Down-regulation of gene expression may therefore represent a general mechanism in the early response of chondrocytes to mechanical stress.\n\nDynamic compression affects various aspects of chondrocyte physiology {#s3e}\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIndependently of the general down-regulation observed in gene expression, careful examination of the extended list of modulated genes indicates that some of them have already been identified as mechanosensitive genes involved in different aspects of cellular physiology like in cartilage, e.g. *Biglycan (Bgn)*, an extracellular matrix protein [@pone.0036964-Wang1], *Mmp9*, a matrix metalloprotease [@pone.0036964-Kisiday1], *Cyr61*, a regulator of chondrogenesis from the CCN family [@pone.0036964-Schild1], *Cited2*, a transcription co-regulator playing a key role in shear-induced regulation of MMPs in chondrocytes [@pone.0036964-Yokota1], or in other tissues, e.g. *Thrombomodulin (Thbd)*, a gene coding for an anticoagulant factor [@pone.0036964-Rossi1], *Lmo4*, a fluid flow-responsive transcription factor [@pone.0036964-Ni1], *Ptgs1/Cox1*, a cyclooxygenase involved in the production of prostaglandin E2 [@pone.0036964-Wang2], or *Ahnak*, a protein involved in Ca^2+^ signalling pathways and regulated exocytosis [@pone.0036964-Kessler1], [@pone.0036964-Borgonovo1]. The regulation of these genes reflects diverse cellular responses to mechanical stimulation.\n\nInterestingly, a subset of modulated genes, including *Pcm1* [@pone.0036964-Keryer1], *Nek1* [@pone.0036964-Shalom1], *Smo* [@pone.0036964-Chen2], *Cdk5rap2* [@pone.0036964-Barrera1], *Spop* [@pone.0036964-Chen3], *Dync2h1* [@pone.0036964-Ocbina1], *Syne1/Nesprin1* [@pone.0036964-Dawe1], *Topors* [@pone.0036964-Chakarova1] and Wnt signalling molecules [@pone.0036964-Lancaster1] such as *Fzd10, Sfrp1, Rspo3/Cristin1*, are linked to ciliary function ([Data S2](#pone.0036964.s002){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). The primary cilium has long been hypothesised to function as an antenna for chondrocytes to sense the biomechanical environment, as in renal cells [@pone.0036964-Nauli1], [@pone.0036964-Praetorius1]. Using the same chondrocyte-agarose constructs as those used here, Wann *et al.* have just provided the first direct experimental evidence that the primary cilium mediates mechanotransduction through control of calcium signalling in compressed chondrocytes [@pone.0036964-Wann1]. Previously, using bovine chondrocyte-agarose constructs and confocal microscopy, McGlashan *et al.* showed that the application of cyclic compression affects cilia length in a time-dependent manner [@pone.0036964-McGlashan1]. In addition, mechanical forces have been reported to play a role in primary cilia assembly/disassembly *in vitro* in other cell types [@pone.0036964-Iomini1], [@pone.0036964-Resnick1]. These observations are correlated with *in vivo* studies, where the presence or absence of cilia is linked to the intensity of shear stress in blood vessels [@pone.0036964-VanderHeiden1]. Therefore, the mechanosensitivity observed here for the subset of cilium-related genes may represent an early signal triggered by chondrocytes to adapt the length and/or function of the primary cilium in response to mechanical loading.\n\nNevertheless, part of the RNA transcriptome corresponds to RNAs that do not code for proteins, referred to as non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) [@pone.0036964-vanBakel1]. Microarray screening identified two down-regulated long ncRNAs in compressed chondrocytes: *Xist* and *Malat1* (1.57-fold and 1.42-fold, respectively, [Data S2](#pone.0036964.s002){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}), which are two of the three large non-coding transcripts present in mammalian nuclei [@pone.0036964-Hutchinson1]. Furthermore, *Dicer1*, a gene coding for an endoribonuclease that processes pre-miRNAs into siRNAs [@pone.0036964-Kim1], was down-regulated by 1.81-fold upon compression. In particular, recent studies have shown that miRNA can control expression of alternative splicing regulators [@pone.0036964-Kalsotra1] and *Malat1* can control the activity of some miRNAs [@pone.0036964-Tripathi1]. This is particularly interesting because alternative splicing events have been recorded in bone following mechanical loading [@pone.0036964-MantilaRoosa1]. These findings suggest that modulation of ncRNA expression is part of the molecular response to mechanical stress. Moreover, it is possible that these ncRNAs participate in the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing in response to compression.\n\nConcluding remarks {#s3f}\n------------------\n\nThe aim of this study was to perform an integrated analysis of mechanotransduction in chondrocytes at the gene and protein level. The originality of our analysis was to investigate early molecular events triggered by dynamic compression. Our study reveals that, in addition to the well-known involvement of the MAPK-signalling pathway in the chondrocyte mechanotransduction response, TGF-\u03b2 signalling may also play a prominent role. In addition, our microarray analysis results provide new molecular insight into how chondrocytes sense dynamic compression. The candidate mechanosensitive genes identified here can serve as starting points for future investigations of mechanotransduction in chondrocytes.\n\nThe availability of genetically modified mice offers an opportunity to study the impact of gene modification in chondrocyte mechanotransduction using the cell model system presented here. Ultimately, identifying candidate mechanosensitive genes can provide important information not only for the molecular understanding of mechanotransduction in chondrocytes, but also for cartilage engineering. For example, agarose (or agarose-alginate) hydrogels constitute clinically potential scaffolds for autologous chondrocyte implantation [@pone.0036964-Barlic1] and mechanical conditioning can be used to stimulate *in vitro* chondrocyte biosynthesis in 3D scaffolds before implantation. Therefore, mechanosensitive targets can help optimise mechanical conditioning for cartilage reconstruction.\n\nMaterials and Methods {#s4}\n=====================\n\nEthics statement {#s4a}\n----------------\n\nMouse care and treatment were conducted in accordance with institutional guidelines in compliance with national and international laws and policies. This study was specifically approved by our local ethics committee (Authorization n\u00b069387416 given by the French Prefecture du Department du Rhone).\n\nAntibodies {#s4b}\n----------\n\nFor type I and type II collagens, polyclonal rabbit antibodies against mature collagens were used (Novotec; references 20151 and 20251, respectively; used at 1\u22362000 and 1\u22365000, respectively). Monoclonal antibody (mAb) against collagen IX (23-5D1; 1\u22366000) was a gift from Bjorn Olsen (Boston, MA). Polyclonal antibodies against \u03b110 (1\u22362000) and \u03b111 (1\u22364000) integrins were from Cartela AB (a gift from Evy Lundgren-Akerlund, Lund, Sweden). Antibodies against Phospho-Smad1/5/8 (\\#9511), Phospho-Smad2 (\\#3101), Phospho-ERK1/2 (\\#9101), Phospho-p38 (\\#9251), Smad2/3 (\\#3102), ERK1/2 (\\#9102), p38 (\\#9212) and anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (all 1\u22361000).

Anti-Sox9 polyclonal antibody (AB5535, 1\u22362000) and anti-FAK monoclonal antibody (clone 4.47, 1\u22365000) were purchased from Millipore. Polyclonal rabbit antibodies against phosphoY397-FAK (1\u22361000) were obtained from Biosource-Invitrogen. Anti-actin monoclonal antibodies (A5060, 1\u2236800) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

Like articular cartilage, rib cartilage is a hyaline-type cartilage. Immediately after enzymatic isolation, cells were embedded in 2% agarose gels at a density of 2\u00d710^6^ cells/mL as described [@pone.0036964-Bougault2]. Chondrocyte-agarose gels were punched to form cylindrical constructs of 13 mm in diameter and 3 mm in thickness. They were then cultured in the wells of Biopress\u2122 compression plates (Flexcell international) for 6 days in 5% CO~2~ at 37\u00b0C. The Dulbecco\\'s modified Eagle\\'s medium/Ham\\'s F-12 culture medium was changed daily as previously detailed [@pone.0036964-Bougault2]. Serum was progressively substituted with insulin-transferrin-selenium and cultures were gradually supplemented with ascorbic acid (up to 20 \u00b5g/mL). Used as positive controls of dedifferentiation, other mouse chondrocytes were cultured in monolayer for one week, passaged once and cultured for another week.\n\nDNA content {#s4d}\n-----------\n\nDNA quantification was performed using the Hoechst 33258 (Fluka) DNA stain. The calibration curve was obtained using a DNA standard solution (Invitrogen).\n\nApplication of dynamic compression {#s4e}\n----------------------------------\n\nChondrocyte-agarose constructs were subjected to compression using a previously characterised model system [@pone.0036964-Bougault2], [@pone.0036964-Bougault1]. The FX-4000C Flexercell Compression Plus System (Flexcell International) was used to apply dynamic compressive strain to agarose gels. Compressed constructs were subjected to cyclical compression ranging from 20 kPa to 40 kPa in a square waveform at a frequency of 0.5 Hz ([Figure 2](#pone-0036964-g002){ref-type=\"fig\"}) for 5, 15 or 30 min. Control constructs were uncompressed.\n\nProtein extraction and analysis by Western blotting {#s4f}\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nProtein extraction from the agarose gels was performed with special care to avoid any modification in the phosphorylation state of proteins [@pone.0036964-Bougault2]. For Western blotting, proteins were separated on 10% or 4--12% polyacrylamide gradient mini-gels and transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore). The membranes were probed with the appropriate primary antibodies, washed and incubated with HRP- or alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG. After multiple washes, bound antibodies were detected on x-ray films using a Bio-Rad Immun-star or WesternC chemiluminescent substrate. The membranes probed with antibodies to collagens or integrins were sequentially re-probed after stripping (Re-Blot Plus Strong, Chemicon). A final re-probing with anti-actin antibodies served as a loading control. The membranes probed with antibodies to phospho-proteins were stripped and re-probed with antibodies that recognise all forms of the protein in question. Phosphorylation levels were quantified by densitometry using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). For each protein, the ratio of phospho-protein band intensity to the total protein band intensity was calculated and mechanically-induced phosphorylation was normalised to uncompressed controls.\n\nDNA microarray analysis {#s4g}\n-----------------------\n\nTotal RNA was extracted from chondrocyte-agarose constructs as previously described [@pone.0036964-Bougault2]. To ensure a sufficient quantity of RNA, extractions from six similar constructs were pooled. To ensure quality of RNA in each sample, integrity and purity were assessed using a capillary electrophoresis system (Agilent Bioanalyser, Agilent Technologies). DNA microarray analysis was performed on four independent experiments to compare gene expression levels between compressed (30 min compression) and uncompressed (control) constructs.\n\nHybridisation was carried out following the Two-Colour Microarray-Based Expression Analysis protocol (Agilent Technologies) and 500 ng or 1 \u00b5g of purified total RNA were used for linear amplification. The resulting labelled cRNA from a compressed sample was co-hybridised with the labelled cRNA of the corresponding control sample to the Agilent Mouse Genome CGH Microarray 44 K probe set (Agilent Technologies). Each co-hybridization was performed several times starting from different total RNA preparations and using a dye swap. Each microarray contained 44,000 sequences spanning the whole mouse genome and control probes. The microarrays were scanned using an Innoscan 700 Microarray Scanner (Innopsys) at 532 nm (for detection of the Cy3 dye) and 635 nm (Cy5 dye). The resulting image was analysed using Mapix v3.1 software. The signal intensity of each spot was acquired and non-exploitable spots were filtered out.\n\nThe statistical analysis and normalisation steps were done using the Limma (Linear Models for Microarray Data) package [@pone.0036964-Smyth1] in the statistical language R [@pone.0036964-Ihaka1]. The \"global Loess\" function was applied to the data to correct for bias. Normalised data were then averaged between direct and swapped comparisons to calculate values of differential expression and expression level. A classification of statistically significant modulations was obtained using a moderated Student\\'s *t*-test with a Bayesian false-discovery rate approach [@pone.0036964-Lnnstedt1]. Analysis of genes associated with cell function was carried out using the PANTHER (Protein ANalysis THrough Evolutionary Relationships) classification system (<http://www.pantherdb.org>) and Pathway-Express (<http://vortex.cs.wayne.edu/Projects.html>) profiling system to identify protein categories or biological pathways which may be associated with modulated gene expression (with M\\>0.5 and p\\<0.01).\n\nConfirmation of modulation in gene expression by real-time PCR {#s4h}\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nReal-time PCR analysis was performed on three independent experiments as previously described [@pone.0036964-Bougault2]. Levels of gene expression were determined by using the comparative Ct method with *RPL13a* gene as the endogenous control. Primer pairs used in this study are described in [Table 2](#pone-0036964-t002){ref-type=\"table\"}. Dissociation curves were conducted at the end of each run to verify the absence of DNA contamination. Student\\'s *t*-test (paired, two-tailed) was used for statistical analysis.\n\nSupporting Information {#s5}\n======================\n\n###### \n\nERK1/2 and p38 transient compression-induced activation in chondrocyte-agarose constructs.
