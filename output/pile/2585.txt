The introduction of the first section of new signalling is a really exciting step for the Tube, and for everyone who uses these lines.\u201d\n\nTrain frequency in central London will increase from 28 to 32 per hour, effective from 2021. Overall project completion is expected in 2023.\n\nThales Ground Transportation Systems vice-president Shaun Jones said: \u201cThe successful introduction of this section is a significant step on the journey to upgrade the signalling system of this highly complex railway.\n\n\u201cThis further demonstrates the capabilities of Thales technology, leading to a reliable railway that enables capacity improvements for people travelling throughout London.\u201d\n\nThe signalling upgrade works are part of a larger modernisation programme for the four Tube lines. The programme includes the introduction of S-stock Tube trains.\n\nIn total, the four lines carry 1.3 million customers daily."
