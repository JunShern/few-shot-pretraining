A. HENTY\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration: IT DID NOT TAKE LONG TO TRANSFER THE SACKS INTO THE BOAT\n_Page 339_]\n\n\n\n\nPREFACE TO THE ORIGINAL EDITION\n\n\nThe mysterious loss of a large portion of the treasure of the Incas has\nnever been completely cleared up. By torturing the natives to whom the\nsecret had been entrusted, the Spaniards made two or three discoveries,\nbut there can be little doubt that these finds were only a small\nproportion of the total amount of the missing hoards, although for\nyears after their occupation of the country the Spaniards spared no\npains and hesitated at no cruelty to bring to light the hidden wealth.\nThe story of the boat which put to sea laden with treasure is\nhistorical, and it was generally supposed that she was lost in a storm\nthat took place soon after she sailed. It was also morally certain that\nthe Peruvians who left the country when the Spaniards became masters\ncarried off with them a very large amount of treasure into that part of\nSouth America lying east of Peru. Legends are current that they founded\na great city there, and that their descendants occupy it at the present\ntime. But the forests are so thick, and the Indian tribes so hostile,\nthat the country has never yet been explored, and it may be reserved\nfor some future traveller, possessing the determination of my two\nheroes, to clear up the mystery of this city as they penetrated that of\nthe lost treasure-ship. It need hardly be said that the state of\nconfusion, misrule, and incessant civil wars which I have described as\nprevailing in Peru presents a true picture of the country at the period\nin which this story is laid.\n\nG.

The room was\nalmost empty, and as they occupied arm-chairs in one corner of it, they\nwere able to talk freely without fear of being overheard. One of them\nwas a man of sixty, the other some five or six and twenty.\n\n\"I must do something,\" the younger man said, \"for I have been kicking\nmy heels about London since my ship was paid off two years ago. At\nfirst, of course, it didn't matter, for I have enough to live upon; but\nrecently I have been fool enough to fall in love with a girl whose\nparents would never dream of allowing her to marry a half-pay\nlieutenant of the navy with no chance in the world of getting employed\nagain, for I have no interest whatever.\"\n\n\"It is an awkward case certainly, Prendergast,\" the other said; \"and\nupon my word, though I sympathize with you, I cannot blame Fortescue.\nHe is not what you might call a genial man, but there is no doubt that\nhe was a splendid lawyer and a wonderful worker. For ten years he\nearned more than any man at the bar. I know that he was twice offered\nthe solicitor-generalship, but as he was making two or three times the\nofficial salary, he would not take it. I believe he would have gone on\nworking till now had he not suddenly come in for a very fine estate,\nowing to the death, in the course of two or three years, of four men\nwho stood between him and it. Besides, I fancy he got hints that in the\ngeneral opinion of the bar he had had a wonderfully good innings, and\nit was about time that younger men had a share in it. What his savings\nwere I do not know, but they must be very large. His three sons are all\nat the bar, and are rising men, so there was no occasion for him to go\non piling up money for them. But, as I say, he has always had the\nreputation of being a hard man, and it is practically certain that he\nwould never allow his daughter to marry a man whom he would regard as\nnext door to a pauper. Now, what are you thinking of doing?\"\n\n\"Well, sir, Miss Fortescue has agreed to wait for me for two years, and\nof course I am eager to do something, but the question is what? I can\nsail a ship, but even could I get the command of a merchantman, it\nwould not improve my position in the eyes of the parents of the lady in\nquestion. Now, you have been knocking about all over the world, I do\nwish you would give me your advice. Where is there money to be got? I\nam equally ready to go to the North Pole or the Equator, to enter the\nservice of an Indian prince, or to start in search of a treasure hidden\nby the old bucaneers.\"\n\n\"You talk Spanish, don't you?\"\n\n\"Yes; all my service has been in the Mediterranean. We were two years\noff the coast of Spain, and in and out of its ports, and as time hung\nheavily on our hands, I got up the language partly to amuse myself and\npartly to be able to talk fluently with my partners at a ball.\"\n\nThe elder man did not speak for a minute or two.\n\n\"You have not thought of South America?\" he said at last.\n\n\"No, Mr. Barnett; I don't know that I have ever thought of one place\nmore than another.\"\n\nThe other was again silent.\n\n\"I don't think you could do better anywhere,\" he said slowly. \"It is a\nland with great possibilities; at any rate it is a land where you could\nbe understood, and of course it would be folly to go anywhere without a\nknowledge of the language. I was, as you know, five years out there,\nand came home when the war broke out between Chili and the Spaniards. I\nhave been more in Peru than in Chili, and as Peru was still in the\nhands of the Spanish, it would have been impossible for me to go there\nagain as long as the war lasted. Knocking about as I did, I heard a\ngreat deal from the natives (I mean the Indians). I gathered from them\na number of their traditions, and I am convinced that they know of any\nnumber of gold mines that were formerly worked, but were blocked up\nwhen the Spaniards invaded the country, and have been kept secret ever\nsince.\n\n\"The natives have never spoken on the subject at all to the Spaniards.\nIf they had, they would have been flogged until they revealed all they\nknew--that is to say, they would have been flogged to death, for no\ntortures will wring from an Indian anything he knows about gold. They\nlook upon that metal as the source of all the misfortunes that have\nfallen upon their race. With an Englishman whom they knew and trusted,\nand who, as they also knew, had no wish whatever to discover gold\nmines, they were a little less reticent. I never asked them any\nquestions on a subject in which I had not a shadow of interest, but I\ncertainly had some curiosity, not of a pecuniary kind, because the\nmatter had always been a riddle as to the hiding-place of the Incas'\ntreasures. And from what I learned I should say it is absolutely\ncertain that a great portion of these escaped the search of their\nSpanish tyrants.\n\n\"Whether the men who were employed in the work all died without\nrevealing the secret, or whether it had been trusted to a chosen few, I\nknow not; but the natives believe that there are still a few among them\nto whom the secret has been passed down from father to son. Anyhow, all\nhad heard vague traditions. Some said that part of the treasure was\ncarried hundreds of miles inland and given over to a tribe of fierce\nsavages, in a country into which no European can enter. Another\ntradition is that a portion of it was carried off by sea in a great\ncanoe, which was never heard of again and was believed to have been\nlost. I am not for a moment supposing, Prendergast, that if you went\nout there you would have the most remote chance of discovering what the\nSpaniards, ever since they landed there, have been in vain trying to\nfind, and I certainly should not think of recommending a mad-brained\nadventure, but undoubtedly there are many rich gold mines yet to be\nfound. There are openings for trade, too; and I can give you\nintroductions to merchants both in Chili and Peru. It is not a thing I\nshould recommend to everyone, far from it; but if you want to combine\nadventure with a chance, however small, of making money, I don't know\nthat you can do better than go to South America. You are fitted for no\ncalling here; your income, counting your half-pay, would suffice to\nkeep you out there, and a couple of years of such a life would do you\nno harm.\"\n\n\"It is just what I should like,\" the young man said enthusiastically;\n\"though I don't know how I should set to work if I did find a mine.\"\n\n\"You would have to bring home specimens, with particulars of the width\nof the lode. Of course you would crush pieces up and wash them\nyourself, or get your Indian to wash them; that would give you an\napproximate idea of the percentage of gold. If it were rich, I could\nintroduce you to men who would advance money for working it, giving you\na share of the profits. They would send out a mining expert with you.\nHe would verify your report, and then you would take up the concession.\nI don't know whether there have been any changes in the regulations,\nbut there is no difficulty in learning how to proceed from one or other\nof the men to whom I will give you introductions. The thing would not\nbe worth thinking of were it not that the man who always went with me\nas guide and muleteer is an Indian, and has, I am convinced, a\nknowledge of some of these places. He was with me all the time I was\nout there. I saved his life when a puma sprang upon him, and he more\nthan once hinted that he could make me a rich man, but I had no\ninclination that way, my income being sufficient for all my wants.\nStill, on the chance that he is alive--and he was about thirty when he\nwas with me fifteen years ago, so it is probable that he is still to\nthe fore--I will give you a letter to him telling him that you are a\ndear friend of mine, and that I trust to him to do any service he can\nfor you just as he would have done for myself. Had it not been for that\nI should never have mentioned the matter to you. These old mines are\nthe dream of every Peruvian. They have been searching for them ever\nsince the conquest of the country, and as they have failed, it is\nabsurd to think that an Englishman would have the slightest chance of\nlighting upon a mine, still less of finding any of the Incas'\ntreasures. But with the Indian's aid it is just possible that you may\nfind something, though I should advise you most strongly not to build\nin any way upon the chance. I consider that you cannot possibly win\nMiss Fortescue; that being so, two years of knocking about will not\nmake your position worse, and by the time you come back, you may have\nceased to struggle against fate. It will afford you a remote--but\ndistinctly remote--opportunity of bettering your position, will give\nyou something else to think about besides that young lady's charms, and\nyou may even come to recognize that life is, after all, possible\nwithout her. You may shake your head, lad; but you know children cry\nfor the moon sometimes, yet afterwards come to understand that it would\nnot be a desirable plaything.\"\n\n\"Well, at any rate, Mr. Barnett, I am extremely obliged for your\nsuggestion and for your offer of introductions. It is just the life\nthat I should enjoy thoroughly. As you say, the chance that anything\nwill come of it is extremely small, but at least there is a\npossibility, and I take it as a drowning man catches at a straw.\"\n\n\"By the way, you mustn't think only of gold; silver is, after all, the\nchief source of the riches of Peru, and there are numbers of\nextraordinarily rich mines. It is calculated that three hundred\nmillions have been produced since the first occupation by the\nSpaniards. Quicksilver is also very abundant; copper and lead are found\ntoo, but there is not much to be done with them at present, owing to\nthe cost of carriage. There is good shooting in the mountains on the\neastern side of the Andes, and you will find plenty of sport there.\"\n\nThey talked over the matter for some time before they separated, and\nHarry Prendergast became quite excited over it. On his return to his\nrooms he was astonished to find the candles alight and a strong smell\nof tobacco pervading the place. A lad of about sixteen leapt from the\neasy-chair in which he had been sitting, with his feet on another.\n\n\"Hullo, Harry, I didn't expect you back so soon! The maid said you were\ndining out, and I suppose that generally means one o'clock before you\nare back.\"\n\n\"Well, what brings you here, Bert? I thought I had got you off my hands\nfor a year at least.\"\n\n\"I thought so, myself,\" the lad said coolly; \"but circumstances have\nbeen too strong for me. We were running down the Channel the night\nbefore last, when a craft that was beating up ran smack into us. I\ndon't know that it was his fault more than ours; the night was dark,\nand it was very thick, and we did not see each other until she was\nwithin a length of us. Luck was against us; if she had been a few\nseconds quicker we should have caught her broadside, but as it was she\nrammed us, knocking a hole in our side as big as a house, and we had\njust time to jump on board her. Our old craft went down two minutes\nafter the skipper, who was of course the last man, left her. The other\nfellow had stove his bow in. Luckily we were only about a couple of\nmiles off Dungeness, and though she leaked like a sieve, we were able\nto run her into the bay, where she settled down in two and a half\nfathoms of water. As soon as it was light we landed and tramped to\nDover. A hoy was starting for the river that evening, and most of us\ncame up in her, arriving at the Pool about three hours ago. It is a bad\njob, Harry, and I am horribly put out about it. Of course nothing could\nbe saved, and there is all the new kit you bought for me down at the\nbottom. I sha'n't bother you again; I have quite made up my mind that I\nshall ship before the mast this time, and a five-pound note will buy me\na good enough outfit for that.\"\n\n\"We need not talk about that now, Bertie. You are certainly an unlucky\nbeggar; this is the second time you have been wrecked.\"\n\n\"It is a frightful nuisance,\" the boy said. \"It is the kit I am\nthinking of, otherwise I should not mind. I didn't care for the\nskipper. He seemed all right and decent enough before we started, but I\nsoon heard from fellows who had sailed with him before that he was a\ntartar; and what was worse, they said he was in the habit of being\ndrunk two nights out of three. However, that has nothing to do with it.\nI am really awfully sorry, Harry. You have been a thundering good elder\nbrother. I hated to think that you had to shell out last time, and I\nhave quite made up my mind that you sha'n't do it again.\"\n\n\"Well, it cannot be helped; it is no fault of yours; still, of course,\nit is a nuisance. Thank God that no harm has come to you, that is the\nprincipal thing. Now, sit down and go on with your pipe, you young\nmonkey. I did not think you had taken to smoking.\"\n\n\"One has to,\" the lad said, \"everyone else does it; and there is no\ndoubt that, when you have got the middle watch on cold nights with foul\nwinds, it is a comfort.\"\n\n\"Well, go on smoking,\" his brother said. \"I will light up too. Now shut\nyour mouth altogether. I want to think.\"\n\nThey were silent for fully ten minutes, then Harry said;\n\n\"I told you about that business of mine with Miss Fortescue.\"\n\nBertie grinned all over his face, which, as he sat, was not visible to\nhis brother. Then with preternatural gravity he turned towards him.\n\n\"Yes, you told me about it; an uncomfortable business wasn't it?--surly\nold father, lovely daughter, and so on.\"\n\n\"I will pull your ear for you, you young scamp,\" Harry said wrathfully,\n\"if you make fun of it; and I have a good mind not to say what I was\ngoing to.\"\n\n\"Say it, Harry, don't mind my feelings,\" the lad said. \"You can't say I\ndid not stand it well when I was here last week, and gave you no end of\nsympathy. Go ahead, old fellow; I dare say I shall be taken bad some\nday, and then I shall be able to make allowances for you.\"\n\n\"I'll have nothing more to say to you, you young imp.\"\n\n\"Don't say that, Harry,\" the lad said in a tone of alarm. \"You know how\nsympathizing I am, and I know what a comfort it is for you to unburden\nyourself; but I do think that it won't be necessary to go into personal\ndescriptions, you know, or to tell me what you said to her or she said\nto you, because you told me all that ten days ago, also what her\ntyrannical old father said. But really seriously I am awfully sorry\nabout it all, and if there is anything that I can possibly do for you I\nshall be only too pleased. I don't see that it would be any advantage\nfor me to go and give the old gentleman my opinion of him; but if you\nthink it would, and can coach me in some of his sore points, we might\nsee how we could work upon them.\"\n\n\"I always thought you were a young ass, Bertie,\" Harry said sternly,\n\"but I have not realized before how utterly assified you are.\"\n\n\"All right, Harry!\" the lad said cheerfully; \"hit me as hard as you\nlike, under the circumstances I feel that I cannot kick.\"\n\nHarry said nothing for another five minutes.\n\n\"This is a serious matter,\" he said at last, \"and I don't want any\ntomfoolery.\"\n\n\"All right, Harry! I will be as serious as a judge.\"\n\n\"I am thinking of going away for two years.\"\n\nThe lad turned half round in his chair and had a good look at his\nbrother.\n\n\"Where are you going to?\" seeing by Harry's rather gloomy face that he\nwas quite in earnest.\n\n\"I believe I am going to Peru.\"\n\n\"What are you going there for, Harry?\" the lad said quietly.\n\n\"I told you,\" the other went on, \"that Mr. Fortescue said that he had\nno personal objection to me, but that if I was in a position to give\nhis daughter a home equal to that which I wanted her to leave, he would\nbe content.\"\n\nBertie nodded.\n\n\"This seemed to me hopeless,\" Harry went on. \"I told you that she was\nwilling to wait for two years, but that she couldn't promise much\nlonger than that, for her father had set his mind on her making a good\nmatch; he has certainly put a tremendous pressure upon her. When I was\ntalking at the club this evening to Mr. Barnett--you know that he is\nour oldest friend and is one of our trustees--I told him about it, and\nsaid that though I was ready to do anything and go anywhere I could not\nsee my way at all to making a big fortune straight away. He agreed with\nme. After talking it over he said he knew of but one way by which such\na thing would be at all possible, but the betting would be twenty\nthousand to one against it. Of course I said that if there was even a\npossibility I would try it. Well, you know he was in Peru for some\nyears. He says that the natives have all sorts of legends about rich\nmines that were hidden when the Spaniards came first, and that it is\ncertain that, tremendous as was the amount of loot they got, a great\npart of the Incas' treasure was hidden away. Once or twice there had\nbeen great finds-in one case two million and a half dollars. It is\nbelieved that the secret is still known to certain Indians. When he\nwent out there he had a muleteer, whose life he saved when he was\nattacked by some beast or other, and this man as much as hinted that he\nknew of a place where treasure might be concealed; but as Barnett was\ninterested in beasts and plants and that sort of thing, and had a\ncomfortable fortune, he never troubled himself about it one way or\nanother. Well, he offered to give me a letter to this man, and he\nregarded it as just possible that the fellow, who seems to be a\ndescendant of some of the people who were members of the Incas' court\nat the time the Spaniards came, may have some knowledge of the rich\nmines that were then closed down, and that he may be able to show them\nto me, from his feeling of gratitude to Barnett. It is but one chance\nin a million, and as I can see no other possibility of making a fortune\nin two years, I am going to try it.\"\n\n\"Of course you will,\" the lad said excitedly, \"and I should think that\nyou would take me with you.\"\n\n\"I certainly had not dreamt of doing so, Bertie. But if I have to keep\non getting fresh outfits for you, the idea has come into my mind during\nthe last half-hour that I could not do better.\"\n\n\"Harry, you are sure to be disappointed lots of times before you hit on\na treasure, and then if you were all by yourself you would get down in\nthe mouth. Now, I should be able to keep you going, pat you on the back\nwhen you felt sick, help you to fight Indians and wild beasts, and be\nuseful in all sorts of ways.\"\n\n\"That is like your impudence, Bertie,\" the other laughed. \"Seriously, I\nknow I shall be a fool to take you, and if I really thought I had any\nchance to speak of I should not do so; but though I am going to try, I\ndon't expect for a moment that I shall succeed. I feel that really it\nwould be a comfort to have someone with me upon whom I could rely in\nsuch a life as I should have to lead. It certainly would be lonely work\nfor one man. The only doubt in my mind is whether it will be fair to\nyou--you have got your profession.\"\n\n\"But I can go back to it if nothing good turns up, Harry. I can visit\nthe firm and tell them that I am going to travel with you for a bit,\nand hope that on my return they will take me back again and let me\nfinish my apprenticeship. I should think they would be rather glad, for\nthey always build and never buy ships, and it will take them six months\nto replace the _Stella_. Besides, it will do me a lot of good. I shall\npick up Spanish--at least, I suppose that is the language they speak\nout there--and shall learn no end of things. As you know, we trade with\nthe west coast of America, so I should be a lot more useful to the firm\nwhen I come back than I am now.\"\n\n\"Well, I will think it over, and let you know in the morning. I must\ncertainly consult Mr. Barnett, for he is your trustee as well as mine.\nIf we go I shall work my way out. It will be a big expense, anyhow, and\nI don't mean, if possible, to draw upon my capital beyond three or four\nhundred pounds. I believe living is cheap out there, and if I buy three\nor four mules I shall then have to pay only the wages for the\nmuleteers, and the expenses of living. Of course I shall arrange for my\nincome and half-pay to be sent out to some firm at Lima. Now, you had\nbetter go off to bed, and don't buoy yourself up with the belief that\nyou are going, for I have by no means decided upon taking you yet.\"\n\n\"You will decide to take me, Harry,\" the lad said confidently, and then\nadded with a laugh: \"the fact that you should have adopted a plan like\nthis is quite sufficient to show that you want somebody to look after\nyou.\"\n\nHarry Prendergast did not get much sleep that night. He blamed himself\nfor having mentioned the matter at all to Bertie, and yet the more he\nthought over it the more he felt that it would be very pleasant to have\nhis brother with him. The lad was full of fun and mischief, but he knew\nthat he had plenty of sound sense, and would be a capital companion,\nand the fact that he had been three years at sea, and was accustomed to\nturn his hand to anything, was all in his favour. If nothing came of it\nhe would only have lost a couple of years, and, as the boy himself had\nsaid, the time would not have been altogether wasted. Bertie was down\nbefore him in the morning. He looked anxiously at his brother as he\ncame in.\n\n\"Well, Harry?\"\n\n\"Well, I have thought it over in every light. But in the first place,\nBertie, if you go with me you will have to remember that I am your\ncommanding officer. I am ten years older than you, and besides I am a\nlieutenant in the King's Navy, while you are only a midshipman in the\nmerchant service. Now, I shall expect as ready obedience from you as if\nI were captain of my own ship and you one of my men; that is absolutely\nessential.\"\n\n\"Of course, Harry, it could not be otherwise.\"\n\n\"Very well, then; in the next place I shall abide by what Mr. Barnett\nsays. He is your guardian as well as trustee, and has a perfect right\nto put a veto upon any wild expedition of this sort. Lastly, I should\nhope, although I don't say that this is absolutely necessary, that you\nmay get your employer's promise to take you back again in order that\nyou may complete your time.\"\n\n\"Thank you very much, Harry!\" the lad said gratefully. \"The first\ncondition you may rely upon being performed, and I think the third will\nbe all right, for I know that I have always been favourably reported\nupon. Old Prosser told me so himself when he said that I should have a\nrise in my pay this voyage. As to Mr. Barnett, of course I can't say,\nbut I should think, as it was he who put you up to this, he must see\nthat it would be good for you to have someone to take care of you.\"\n\n\"I think he is much more likely to say that I shall have quite enough\nto do to take care of myself, without having the bother of looking\nafter you. However, I will go and see him this morning. You had better\ncall upon your employers.\"\n\n\"Don't you think I had better go to Mr. Barnett with you, Harry?\"\n\n\"Not as you are now anyhow, Bertie. Your appearance is positively\ndisgraceful. You evidently had on your worst suit of clothes when you\nwere wrecked, and I can see that they have not been improved by the\nexperience. Why, there is a split right down one sleeve, and a big rent\nin your trousers!\"\n\n\"I got them climbing on board, for I had no time to pick and choose,\nwith the _Stella_ sinking under my feet.\"\n\n\"Well, you may as well go as you are, but you had better borrow a\nneedle and thread from the landlady and mend up the holes. You really\ncannot walk through the city in that state. I will see about getting\nyou some more clothes when we get back, for I cannot have you coming\nhere in these in broad daylight. Here are three guineas; get yourself a\nsuit of pilot cloth at some outfitter's at the East End. It will be\nuseful to you anyhow, whether you go with me or ship again here.\"\n\n\"There is a good deal in what you say, Harry,\" Mr. Barnett said when\nPrendergast asked his opinion as to his taking his brother with him.\n\"Two years would not make any material difference in his career as a\nsailor; it simply means that he will be so much older when he passes as\nmate. There is no harm in that. Two or three and twenty is quite young\nenough for a young fellow to become an officer, and I don't think that\nmany captains care about having lads who have just got their\ncertificate. They have not the same sense of responsibility or the same\npower of managing. Then, too, Bertie will certainly have a good deal of\nknocking about if he spends a couple of years in South America, and the\nknowledge he will gain of Spanish will add to his value with any firm\ntrading on that coast. As far as you are concerned, I think it would be\na great advantage to have him with you. In a long expedition, such as\nyou propose, it is a gain to have a companion with you. It makes the\nwork more pleasant, and two men can laugh over hardships and\ndisagreeables that one alone would grumble at; but apart from this, it\nis very important in case of illness.\n\n\"A lonely man laid up with fever, or accidental injury, fares badly\nindeed if he is at a distance from any town where he can obtain medical\nattendance, and surrounded only by ignorant natives. I was myself at\none time down with fever for six weeks in a native hut, and during that\ntime I would have given pretty nearly all that I was worth for the\nsight of a white face and the sound of an English voice. As to the fact\nthat it is possible that the lad might catch fever, or be killed in an\naffray with natives, that must, of course, be faced; but as a sailor he\nruns the risk of shipwreck, or of being washed overboard, or killed by\na falling spar. Everything considered, I think the idea of his going\nwith you is a good one. I don't suppose that many guardians would be of\nthe same opinion, but I have been so many years knocking about in one\npart of the world or another, that I don't look at things in the same\nlight as men who have never been out of England.\"\n\n\"I am glad you see it in that way, sir. I own that it would be a great\nsatisfaction to have him with me. He certainly would be a cheery\ncompanion, and I should say that he is as hard as nails, and can stand\nas much fatigue and hardship as myself. Besides, there is no doubt that\nin case of any trouble two men are better than one.\"\n\n\"I cannot advance any money out of the thousand pounds that will come\nto him when he is of age. By your father's will it was ordered that, in\nthe event of his own death before that time, the interest was to\naccumulate. Your father foresaw that, like you, probably Bertie would\ntake to the sea, and as the amount would be fully two thousand pounds\nby the time he comes of age, it would enable him to buy a share in any\nship that he might, when he passed his last examination, command; but I\nwill myself draw a cheque for a hundred pounds, which will help towards\nmeeting expenses. I feel myself to some extent responsible for this\nexpedition. I somewhat regret now having ever spoken to you on the\nsubject, for I cannot conceal from myself that the chance of your\nmaking a discovery, where the Spaniards, with all their power of\nputting pressure on the natives for the past two or three hundred\nyears, have failed, is so slight as to be scarcely worth consideration.\n\n\"I tell you frankly that I broached the subject chiefly because I\nthought it was much better for you to be doing something than kicking\nyour heels about London, and mooning over this affair with Miss\nFortescue. There is nothing worse for a young man than living in London\nwith just enough to keep him comfortably without the necessity of\nworking. Therefore I thought you would be far better travelling and\nhunting for treasure in Peru, than staying here. Even if you fail, as I\nfeel is almost certain, in the object for which you go out, you will\nhave plenty to occupy your thoughts, and not be dwelling continually\nupon an attachment which in all probability will not turn out\nsatisfactorily. I do not suppose that you are likely to forget Miss\nFortescue, but by the time you return you will have accustomed yourself\nto the thought that it is useless to cry for the moon, and that, after\nall, life may be very endurable even if she does not share it.\nTherefore I propounded this Peruvian adventure, feeling sure that,\nwhatever came of it, it would be a benefit to you.\"\n\n\"No doubt it will, sir. I see myself the chance of success is small\nindeed, but there is none at all in any other way. It is just the sort\nof thing I should like, and I quite feel myself that it would be good\nfor me to have plenty to think about; and now that you have consented\nto Bertie's going with me, I feel more eager than before to undertake\nthe expedition. The place is in rather a disturbed state, isn't it?\"\n\n\"If you are going to wait until Peru ceases to be in a disturbed state,\nHarry, you may wait another hundred years. The Spanish rule was bad,\nbut Peru was then a pleasant place to live in compared with what it is\nnow. It is a sort of cock-pit, where a succession of ambitious rascals\nstruggle for the spoils, and the moment one gets the better of his\nrivals fresh intrigues are set on foot, and fresh rebellions break out.\nThere are good Peruvians--men who have estates and live upon them, and\nwho are good masters. But as to the politicians, there is no principle\nwhatever at stake. It is simply a question of who shall have the\nhandling of the national revenue, and divide it and the innumerable\nposts among his adherents. But these struggles will not affect you\nlargely. In one respect they will even be an advantage. Bent upon their\nown factious aims, the combatants have no time to concern themselves\nwith the doings of an English traveller, whose object out there is\nostensibly to botanize and shoot. Were one of them to obtain the\nundisputed control of affairs he might meddle in all sorts of ways;\nbut, as it is, after you have once got pretty well beyond the area of\ntheir operations, you can regard their doings with indifference,\nknowing that the longer they go on fighting the fewer scoundrels there\nwill be in the land.\n\n\"But even were they to think that it was mining, and not science or\nsport that took you out there, they would scarcely interfere with you.\nIt is admitted by all the factions that Peru needs capital for her\ndevelopment, and at present that can best be got from this country. The\ndiscovery of a fresh mine means employment to a large number of people,\nand the increase of the revenues by a royalty or taxation. English\nexplorers who have gone out have never had any reason to complain of\ninterference on the part of the authorities. You will find the average\nbetter class of Peruvians a charming people, and extremely hospitable.\nThe ladies are pretty enough to turn the head of anyone whose\naffections are not already engaged. The men are kindly and courteous in\nthe extreme. However, you would have little to do with these.\n\n\"In the mountains you would largely depend upon your rifle for food,\nand on what you could get in the scattered native villages. The Indians\nhave no love for the Peruvians. They find their condition no better off\nunder them than it was under the Spaniards. Once they find out that you\nare English they will do all in their power for you. It is to Cochrane\nand the English officers with him that they owe the overthrow and\nexpulsion of their Spanish tyrants, and they are vastly more grateful\nthan either the Chilians or Peruvians have shown themselves to be.\"\n\nOn returning to their lodgings Harry met his brother, who had been into\nthe city.\n\n\"Old Prosser was very civil,\" said Bertie. \"He said that as their ships\nwere chiefly in the South American trade it would be a great advantage\nfor me to learn to speak Spanish well. They had not yet thought\nanything about whether they should order another ship to replace the\n_Stella_; at any rate, at present they had no vacancy, and would gladly\ngive me permission to travel in South America, and would find me a\nberth to finish my apprenticeship when I returned. More than that, they\nsaid that as I had always been so favourably reported upon they would\nput me on as a supernumerary in the _Para_, which will sail in a\nfortnight for Callao. I should not draw pay, but I should be in their\nservice, and the time would count, which would be a great pull, and I\nshould get my passage for nothing.\"\n\n\"That is capital. Of course I will take a passage in her too.\"\n\n\"And what does Mr. Barnett say?\"\n\n\"Rather to my surprise, Bertie, he did not disapprove of the plan at\nall. He thought it would be a good thing for me to have you with me in\ncase of illness or anything of that sort. Then no doubt he thought to\nsome extent it would keep you out of mischief.\"\n\n\"I don't believe he thought anything of the sort. Did he say so?\"\n\n\"Well, no, he didn't; but I have no doubt he felt it in some way a sort\nof relief.\"\n\n\"That is all very fine. I know, when I have been down to his place in\nthe country between voyages, I have always been as well behaved as if I\nhad been a model mid.\"\n\n\"Well, I have heard some tales of your doings, Bertie, that didn't seem\nquite in accord with the character you give yourself.\"\n\n\"Oh, of course I had a few larks! You cannot expect a fellow who has\nbeen away from England for a year to walk about as soberly as if he\nwere a Methodist parson!\"\n\n\"No, I should not expect that, Bertie. But, on the other hand, I should\nhardly have expected that he would, for example, risk breaking his neck\nby climbing up to the top of the steeple and fastening a straw-hat on\nthe head of the weathercock.\"\n\n\"It gave it a very ornamental appearance; and that weathercock was\nnever before watched so regularly by the people of the village as it\nwas from that time till the hat was blown away in a gale.\"\n\n\"That I can quite believe. Still, Mr. Barnett told me that the rector\nlodged a complaint about it.\"\n\n\"He might complain as much as he liked; there is no law in the land, as\nfar as I know, that makes the fixing of a straw-hat upon a weathercock\na penal offence. It did no end of good in the village, gave them\nsomething to talk about, and woke them up wonderfully.\"\n\n\"And there were other things too, I think,\" his brother went on.\n\n\"Oh, well, you need not go into them now! they are an old story.\nBesides, I fancy I have heard of various tricks played by Mr.\nMidshipman Harry Prendergast, and, as I heard them from your lips, I\ncannot doubt but that they were strictly veracious. Well, this is jolly\nnow. When are we going to begin to get our outfit?\"\n\n\"We will lose no time about that. But really there is not much to\nget--a couple of good rifles and two brace of pistols, with a good\nstore of ammunition, those clothes you have just bought, and two or\nthree suits of duck for the voyage. I shan't get any special kit until\nwe arrive there, and can take the advice of people at Lima whether we\nhad better travel in European clothes or in those worn by the\nPeruvians. Of course saddles and bridles and all that sort of thing we\ncan buy there, and we shall want a small tent to use when we get into\nout-of-the-way places. I shall take three hundred pounds in gold. I\nhave no doubt we can exchange it into silver profitably; besides, it is\nmuch more handy for carrying about. I shall go down this afternoon and\nsee Prosser and secure a berth.\"\n\n\"I think you will have to arrange that with the captain. Very few of\nour ships have accommodation for passengers, but the captains are\nallowed to take one or two if they like.\"\n\n\"All right! At any rate I must go to the office first. They can refer\nme to the skipper if they like; that would be better than my going to\nhim direct.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nTHE START\n\n\nHarry Prendergast went down to Leadenhall Street and saw the managing\nowner of the _Para_. As Bertie had anticipated, Mr. Prosser, after\nhearing Harry's statement that he wished to take a passage to Callao in\nthe vessel advertised to start in a week's time, and that he was much\nobliged to them for giving Bertie a berth as supernumerary midshipman,\nsaid:\n\n\"We shall certainly have pleasure in putting your brother's name on the\nship's books. He has already explained to me his desire to go out with\nyou; we have had every reason to be satisfied with him since he entered\nour service, and he had better draw pay as usual, as his service during\nthe voyage will then count towards his time. As for yourself, we do not\nbook passengers, it is more bother than it is worth; but we have no\nobjection to our masters taking one or two. The addition of a mouth or\nso practically makes very little difference in the amount of ships'\nstores consumed. The masters pay us a small sum a head and make their\nown terms with the passengers they take. In that way we are saved all\ncomplaints as to food and other matters. Of course a passenger would\nput on board for himself a stock of such wines, spirits, and little\nluxuries as he may choose.\n\n\"You will find Captain Peters down at the docks. The last cargo has\nbeen discharged, and they are giving an overhaul to the rigging and\nmaking a few repairs; he is not a man to leave his ship if he can help\nit while work is going on there.\"\n\nHarry at once went down.\n\n\"Well, sir,\" the captain said, when he had told him that he wished to\ntake a passage to Callao, and that the owners had referred him to him,\n\"I had fully made up my mind that I would not take passengers again. On\nmy last voyage they were always grumbling at the food, expecting to be\ntreated as if they were in a first-class hotel.\"\n\n\"I am not likely to grumble, Captain; I have been knocking about the\nKing's service since I was fourteen.\"\n\n\"Oh, you are a royal navy man, are you, sir?\"\n\n\"I am; I am a lieutenant.\"\n\n\"That makes a difference; and I have no doubt we can arrange the matter\nto our satisfaction.\"\n\n\"I may tell you,\" Harry said, \"that I have a younger brother coming out\nwith me. He is an apprentice nearly out of his time, and was on board\nthe _Stella_ when she was sunk in the Channel. Your owners have kindly\narranged that he shall go out with you as a supernumerary; that is one\nreason why I wish to go in your ship.\"\n\nThe Master thought for a minute or two. \"Well, Mr. Prendergast,\" he\nsaid, \"I like having one of you naval gentlemen on board; if anything\ngoes wrong it is a comfort to have your advice. If we have bad weather\nround the Horn, could I rely upon you to give me a helping hand should\nI need it? I don't mean that you should keep watch or anything of that\nsort, but that you should, as it were, stand by me. I have a new first\nmate, and there is no saying how he may turn out. No doubt the firm\nwould make every enquiry. Still, such enquiries don't mean much; a\nmaster doesn't like to damn a man by refusing to give him a good\ncharacter. I dare say he is all right. Still, I should certainly feel\nvery much more comfortable if I had a naval officer with me. Now, sir,\nI pay the firm twelve pounds for each passenger I take as his share of\nthe cabin stores; you pay me that, and I will ask for nothing for your\npassage. I cannot say fairer than that.\"\n\n\"You cannot indeed, Captain, and I feel very much obliged to you for\nthe offer--very much obliged. It will suit me admirably, and in case of\nany emergency you may rely upon my aid; and if you have a spell of bad\nweather I shall be quite willing to take a watch, for I know that in\nthe long heavy gales you meet with going round the Horn the officers\nget terribly overtaxed.\"\n\n\"And how about your brother?\" the captain said; \"as he is to be a\nsupernumerary, I suppose that only means that the firm are willing that\nhe shall put in his time for his rating. I have never had a\nsupernumerary on board, but I suppose he is to be regarded as a\npassenger rather than one of the ship's complement.\"\n\n\"No, Captain, he is to be on the pay-sheet; and I think he had much\nbetter be put into a watch. He would find the time hang very heavy on\nhis hands if he had nothing to do, and I know he is anxious to learn\nhis profession thoroughly. As he is to be paid, there is no reason why\nhe should not work.\"\n\n\"Very well; if you think so we will say nothing more about it. I\nthought perhaps you would like to have him aft with you.\"\n\n\"I am much obliged to you, but I think the other way will be best; and\nI am sure he would feel more comfortable with the other apprentices\nthan as a passenger.\"\n\n\"Are you going out for long, may I ask you, Mr. Prendergast?\"\n\n\"For a couple of years or so. I am going to wander about and do some\nshooting and exploring and that sort of thing, and I am taking him with\nme as companion. I speak Spanish fairly well myself, and shall teach\nhim on the voyage, if you will allow me to do so. A knowledge of that\nlanguage will be an advantage to him when he comes back into Prosser &\nCo.'s service.\"\n\n\"A great advantage,\" the captain agreed. \"Most of us speak a little\nSpanish, but I have often thought that it would pay the company to send\na man who could talk the lingo well in each ship. They could call him\nsupercargo, and I am sure he would pay his wages three or four times\nover by being able to bargain and arrange with the Chilians and\nPeruvians. In ports like Callao, where there is a British consul,\nthings are all right, but in the little ports we are fleeced right and\nleft. Boatmen and shopkeepers charge us two or three times as much as\nthey do their own countrymen, and I am sure that we could get better\nbargains in hides and other produce if we had someone who could knock\ndown their prices.\"\n\n\"When do you sail, Captain?\"\n\n\"This day week. It will be high tide about eight, and we shall start to\nwarp out of dock a good half-hour earlier, so you can either come on\nboard the night before or about seven in the morning.\"\n\n\"Very well, sir; we shall be here in good time. I shall bring my things\non board with me; it is of no use sending them on before, as they will\nnot be bulky and can be stored away in my cabin.\"\n\n\"This will be your state-room,\" the captain said, opening a door. \"I\nhave the one aft, and the first mate has the one opposite to you. The\nothers are empty, so you can stow any baggage that you have in one of\nthem; the second and third officers and the apprentices are in the\ndeck-house cabins.\"\n\n\"In that case, Captain, I will send the wine and spirits on board the\nday before. Of course I shall get them out of bond; I might have\ndifficulty in doing that so early in the morning. You will perhaps be\ngood enough to order them to be stowed in one of the empty cabins.\"\n\n\"That will be the best plan,\" the captain said.\n\n\"When do the apprentices come on board?\"\n\n\"The morning before we sail. There is always plenty to be done in\ngetting the last stores on board.\"\n\n\"All right! my brother will be here. Good-morning, Captain, and thank\nyou!\"\n\nThe following morning at eleven Harry Prendergast was standing in front\nof the entrance to the British Museum. A young lady came up. \"It is\nvery imprudent of you, Harry,\" she said, after the first greeting, \"to\nask me to meet you.\"\n\n\"I could not help it, dear; it was absolutely necessary that I should\nsee you.\"\n\n\"But it is of no use, Harry.\"\n\n\"I consider that it is of particular use, Hilda.\"\n\n\"But you know, Harry, when you had that very unpleasant talk with my\nfather, I was called in, and said that I had promised to wait two years\nfor you. When he found that I would not give way, he promised that he\nwould not press me, on the understanding that we were not to meet again\nexcept in public, and I all but promised.\"\n\n\"Quite so, dear; but it appears to me that this is surely a public\nplace.\"\n\n\"No, no, Harry; what he meant was that I was not to meet you except at\nparties.\"\n\n\"Well, I should have asked you to meet me to-day even if I had had to\nstorm your father's house to see you. I am going away, dear, and he\ncould scarcely say much if he came along and found us talking here. You\nsee, it was not likely that I should stumble across a fortune in the\nstreets of London. I have talked the matter over with Barnett--you know\nour trustee, you have met him once or twice--and we came to the\nconclusion that the only possible chance of my being able to satisfy\nyour father as to my means, was for me to go to Peru and try to\ndiscover a gold mine there or hidden treasure. Such discoveries have\nbeen made, and may be made again; and he has supplied me with a letter\nto an Indian, who may possibly be able to help me.\"\n\n\"To Peru, Harry! Why, they are always fighting there.\"\n\n\"Yes, they do a good deal of squabbling, but the people in general have\nlittle to do with it; and certainly I am not going out to take any part\nin their revolutions. There is not a shadow of doubt that a number of\ngold mines worked by the old people were never discovered by the\nSpaniards, and it is also certain that a great portion of the treasures\nof the Incas is still lying hid. Barnett saved the life of a muleteer\nout there, and from what he said he believed that the man did know\nsomething about one of these lost mines, and might possibly let me into\nthe secret. It is just an off chance, but it is the only chance I can\nsee. You promised your father that you would never marry without his\nconsent, and he would never give it unless I were a rich man. If\nnothing comes of this adventure I shall be no worse off than I am at\npresent. If I am fortunate enough to discover a rich mine or a hidden\ntreasure, I shall be in a position to satisfy his demand. I am going to\ntake Bertie with me; he will be a cheerful companion, and even now he\nis a powerful young fellow. At any rate, if I get sick or anything of\nthat sort, it would be an immense advantage to have him with me.\"\n\n\"I don't like the idea of your going, Harry,\" she said tearfully.  \"No,\ndear; and if I had the chance of seeing you sometimes, and of some day\nobtaining your father's consent to the marriage, all the gold mines in\nPeru would offer no temptation to me. As it is, I can see nothing else\nfor it. In some respects it is better; if I were to stay here I should\nonly be meeting you frequently at dances and dinners, never able to\ntalk to you privately, and feeling always that you could never be mine.\nIt would be a constant torture. Here is a possibility--a very remote\none, I admit, but still a possibility--and even if it fails I shall\nhave the satisfaction of knowing that I have done all that a man could\ndo to win you.\"\n\n\"I think it is best that you should go somewhere, Harry, but Peru seems\nto be a horrible place.\"\n\n\"Barnett speaks of it in high terms. You know he was four or five years\nout there. He describes the people as being delightful, and he has\nnothing to say against the climate.\"\n\n\"I will not try to dissuade you,\" she said bravely after a pause. \"At\npresent I am hopeless, but I shall have something to hope and pray for\nwhile you are away. We will say good-bye now, dear. I have come to meet\nyou this once, but I will not do so again, another meeting would but\ngive us fresh pain. I am very glad to know that your brother is going\nwith you. I shall not have to imagine that you are ill in some\nout-of-the-way place without a friend near you; and in spite of the\ndangers you may have to run, I would rather think of you as bravely\ndoing your best than eating your heart out here in London. I shall not\ntell my father that we have met here; you had better write to him and\nsay that you are leaving London at once, and that you hope in two years\nto return and claim me in accordance with his promise. I am sure he\nwill be glad to know that you have gone, and that we shall not be\nconstantly meeting. He will be kinder to me than he has been of late,\nfor as he will think it quite impossible that you can make a fortune in\ntwo years he will be inclined to dismiss you altogether from his mind.\"\n\nFor another half-hour they talked together, and then they parted with\nrenewed protestations on her part that nothing should induce her to\nbreak her promise to wait for him for two years. He had given her the\naddress of one of the merchants to whom Mr. Barnett had promised him a\nletter of introduction, so that she might from time to time write, for\nthe voyage would take at least four months and as much more would be\nrequired for his first letter to come back. He walked moodily home\nafter parting with her.\n\n\"Hullo, Harry! nothing wrong with you, I hope? why, you look as grave\nas an owl.\"\n\n\"I feel grave, Bertie. I have just said good-bye to Hilda; and though I\nkept up my spirits and made the best of this expedition of ours, I\ncannot but feel how improbable it is that we shall meet again--that is\nto say, in our present relations; for if I fail I certainly shall not\nreturn home for some years; it would be only fair to her that I should\nnot do so. I know that she would keep on as long as there was any hope,\nbut I should not care to think that she was wasting her life. I was an\nass to believe it could ever be otherwise, and I feel that the best\nthing for us both would have been for me to go away as soon as I found\nthat I was getting fond of her.\"\n\n\"Well, of course I cannot understand it, Harry, and it seems to me that\none girl is very like another; she may be a bit prettier than the\naverage, but I suppose that comes to all the same thing in another\ntwenty years. I can understand a man getting awfully fond of his ship,\nespecially when she is a clipper. However, some day I may feel\ndifferent; besides, how could you tell that her father would turn out\nsuch a crusty old beggar?\"\n\n\"I suppose I did not think about it one way or the other, Bertie,\"\nHarry said quietly. \"However, the mischief is done, and even if there\nwas no chance whatever of making money I should go now for my own sake\nas well as hers. Well, it is of no use talking more about it; we will\ngo out now and buy the rifles. I shan't get them new, one can pick up\nguns just as good at half the price, and as I know something about\nrifles I am not likely to be taken in. Of course I have got my pistols\nand only have a brace to buy for you. You will have time on the voyage\nto practise with them; if you did not do that you would be as likely to\nshoot me as a hostile Indian.\"\n\n\"Oh, that is bosh!\" the boy said; \"still, I certainly should like to be\na good shot.\"\n\nAfter getting the rifles and pistols, Harry went into the city and\nordered six dozen of wine and three dozen of brandy to be sent on board\nout of bond; he also ordered a bag of twenty pounds of raw coffee, a\nchest of tea, and a couple of dozen bottles of pickles and sauces, to\nbe sent down to the docks on the day before the _Para_ sailed. Another\nsuit of seafaring clothes and a stock of underclothing was ordered for\nBertie. Harry spent the intervening time before the vessel sailed in\nlooking up his friends and saying good-bye to them, and drove down to\nthe docks at the appointed time, his brother having joined the ship on\nthe previous day.\n\nThe _Para_ was a barque-rigged ship of some eight hundred tons. At\npresent she did not show to advantage, her deck being littered with\nstores of all kinds that had come on board late. The deck planks where\nthey could be seen were almost black, the sails had been partly loosed\nfrom the gaskets, and to an eye accustomed to the neatness and order of\na man-of-war her appearance was by no means favourable; but her sides\nshone with fresh paint, and, looking at her lines from the wharf, Harry\nthought she would be both fast and a good sea-boat. She was not heavily\nladen, and stood boldly up in the water. Nodding to Bertie, who was\nworking hard among the men, he went up on to the poop, from which\nCaptain Peters was shouting orders.\n\n\"Glad to see you, sir,\" the captain said; \"she looks rather in a litter\nat present, doesn't she? We shall get her all ataunto before we get\ndown to the Nore. These confounded people won't send their stores on\nboard till the last moment. If I were an owner I should tell all\nshippers that no goods would be received within five or six hours of\nthe ship's time for sailing; that would give us a fair chance, instead\nof starting all in a muddle, just at the time, too, when more than any\nother one wants to have the decks free for making short tacks down\nthese narrow reaches. I believe half the wrecks on the sands at the\nmouth of the river are due to the confusion in which the ships start.\nHow can a crew be lively in getting the yards over when they have to go\nabout decks lumbered up like this, and half of them are only just\nrecovering from their bout of drink the day before?\"\n\nUp to the last moment everyone on board was hard at work, and when the\norder was given to throw off the hawsers the deck was already\ncomparatively clear. Half an hour later the vessel passed out through\nthe dock gates, with two boats towing ahead so as to take her well out\ninto the river; the rest of the crew were employed in letting the sails\ndrop. As soon as she gathered way the men in the boats were called in,\nthe boats themselves being towed behind in case they might again be\nrequired.\n\nThe passage from the Pool to the mouth of the river was in those days\nthe most dangerous portion of the voyage. There were no tugs to seize\nthe ships and carry them down to the open water, while the channels\nbelow the Nore were badly buoyed and lighted, and it was no uncommon\nthing for twenty vessels to get upon the sands in the course of a\nsingle tide.\n\nThe wind was light, and being northerly helped them well on their way,\nand it was only in one or two reaches that the _Para_ was unable to lay\nher course. She overtook many craft that had been far ahead of her, and\nanswered the helm quickly.\n\n\"She is both fast and handy, I see,\" Harry Prendergast, who had been\nwatching her movements with interest, remarked.\n\n\"Yes; there are not many craft out of London can show her their heels\nwhen the wind is free. She does not look quite so well into the wind as\nI should wish; still, I think she is as good as most of them.\"\n\n\"I suppose you will get down to Gravesend before the tide turns?\"\n\n\"Yes, we shall anchor there. The wind is not strong enough for us to\nstem the tide, which runs like a sluice there. Once past the Nore one\ncan do better, but there is no fighting the tide here unless one has a\nsteady breeze aft. I never feel really comfortable till we are fairly\nround the South Foreland; after that it is plain sailing enough. Though\nthere are a few shoals in the Channel, one can give them a wide berth;\nfogs are the things we have to fear there.\"\n\n\"Yes. I have never been down the river, having always joined my ships\neither at Portsmouth or Plymouth, so I know very little about it; but I\nknow from men who have been on board vessels commissioned at Chatham or\nSheerness that they are thankful indeed when they once get round the\nGoodwins and head west.\"\n\n\"Well, Mr. Prendergast, I am against these new-fangled steamboats--I\nsuppose every true sailor is; but when the _Marjory_ began to run\nbetween London and Gravesend eighteen years ago--in '15 I think it\nwas--folks did say that it would not be long before sailing craft would\nbe driven off the sea. I did not believe that then, and I don't believe\nit now; but I do say that I hope before long there will be a lot of\nsmall steamers on the Thames, to tow vessels down till they are off the\nNorth Foreland. It would be a blessing and a comfort to us master\nmariners. Once there we have the choice of going outside the Goodwins,\nor taking a short cut inside if the wind is aft. Why, sir, it would add\nyears to our lives and shorten voyages by weeks. There we are, now,\nsometimes lying off the Nore, five hundred sail, waiting for the wind\nto shift out of the east, and when we do get under weigh we have always\nto keep the lead going. One never knows when one may bump upon the\nsands. Some masters will grope their way along in the dark, but for my\npart I always anchor. There are few enough buoys and beacons in\ndaytime, but I consider that it is tempting Providence to try and go\ndown in a dark night. The owners are sensible men and they know that it\nis not worth while running risks just to save a day or two when you\nhave got a four months' voyage before you. Once past Dover I am ready\nto hold on with anyone, but between the Nore and the North Foreland I\npick my way as carefully as a woman going across a muddy street.\"\n\n\"You are quite right, Captain; I thoroughly agree with you. More ships\nget ashore going down to the mouth of the Thames than in any other part\nof the world; and, as you say, if all sailing ships might be taken down\nby a steamer, it would be the making of the port of London.\"\n\n\"Your brother is a smart young chap, Mr. Prendergast. I was watching\nhim yesterday, and he is working away now as if he liked work. He has\nthe makings of a first-rate sailor. I hold that a man will never become\na first-class seaman unless he likes work for its own sake. There are\nthree sorts of hands. There is the fellow who shirks his work whenever\nhe has a chance; there is the man who does his work, but who does it\nbecause he has to do it, and always looks glad when a job is over; and\nthere is the lad who jumps to his work, chucks himself right into it,\nand puts his last ounce of strength on a rope. That is the fellow who\nwill make a good officer, and who, if needs be, can set an example to\nthe men when they have to go aloft to reef a sail in a stiff gale. So,\nas I understand, Mr. Prendergast, he is going to leave the sea for a\nbit. It seems a pity too.\"\n\n\"He will be none the worse for it, Captain. A year or so knocking about\namong the mountains of Peru will do more good to him than an equal time\non board ship. It will sharpen him up, and give him habits of reliance\nand confidence. He will be all the better for it afterwards, even\nputting aside the advantage it will be to him to pick up Spanish.\"\n\n\"Yes, it may do him good,\" the captain agreed, \"if it does not take\naway his liking for the sea.\"\n\n\"I don't think it will do that. If the first voyage or two don't sicken\na lad, I think it is pretty certain he is cut out for the sea. Of\ncourse it is a very hard life at first, especially if the officers are\na rough lot, but when a boy gets to know his duty things go more easily\nwith him; he is accustomed to the surroundings, and takes to the food,\nwhich you know is not always of the best, with a good appetite. Bertie\nhas had three years of it now, and when he has come home I have never\nheard a grumble from him; and he is not likely to meet with such\nluxuries while we are knocking about as to make him turn up his nose at\nsalt junk.\"\n\nThe tide was already turning when they reached Gravesend. As soon as\nthe anchor was down the steward came up to say that dinner was ready.\n\n\"I am not at all sorry,\" Harry said as he went below with the captain.\n\"I ate a good breakfast before I started at half-past six, and I went\nbelow and had a biscuit and bottle of beer at eleven, but I feel as\nhungry as a hunter now. There is nothing like a sea appetite. I have\nbeen nearly two years on shore, and I never enjoyed a meal as I do at\nsea.\"\n\nThe crew had been busy ever since they left the dock, and the deck had\nnow been scrubbed and made tidy, and presented a very different\nappearance from that which met Harry's eye as he came on board.\n\nJohnson, the first mate, also dined with the skipper. He was a tall,\npowerfully-built man. He was singularly taciturn, and took no share in\nthe conversation unless directly asked. He seemed, however, to be able\nto appreciate a joke, but never laughed audibly, contenting himself\nwith drawing his lips apart and showing his teeth.\n\nThe wind was light and baffling, so that they did not round the South\nForeland until the seventh day after leaving dock. After that it was\nfavourable and steady, and they ran without any change until they\napproached the line; then there was a fortnight of calm. At last they\ngot the wind again, and made a rapid run until within five hundred\nmiles of Cape Horn. The captain was in high glee.\n\n\"We have done capitally so far, Mr. Prendergast. I don't think I ever\nmade so rapid a run. If she goes on like this we shall reach Callao\nwithin three months of starting.\"\n\n\"I don't think the weather will continue like this,\" the mate said.\n\nThis was the first original observation he had made since he had\nsailed, and Harry and the captain looked at him in surprise.\n\n\"You think there is going to be a change, Mr. Johnson?\" the captain\nsaid, after a short pause to recover from his astonishment.\n\nThe mate nodded.\n\n\"Glass falling, sky hazy.\"\n\n\"Is the glass falling? I am ashamed to say I have not looked at it for\nthe past twenty-four hours. It has stuck so long at the same point that\nI have quite ceased to look at it two or three times a day as I usually\ndo.\"\n\n\"It has not fallen much, but it is sinking.\"\n\nThe captain got up from the table, and went to look at the glass.\n\n\"You are right, it has fallen a good eighth; but that may mean a change\nof wind. Did you notice any change, Mr. Prendergast?\"\n\n\"No, I can't say that I did. I looked up, as a sailor always does, when\nI was on deck this morning, but it was clear enough then, and I have\nnot noticed it particularly since.\"\n\nBut when they went up on deck half an hour later both agreed that the\nmate was right. The change overhead was slight, but away to the west a\ndull reddish mist seemed to obscure the horizon.\n\n\"We will get the upper sails off at once, Mr. Johnson. These storms\ncome so suddenly off the coast that it is as well to lose no time in\nshortening sail when one sees any indication of such a change.\"\n\nThe mate at once gave the necessary orders. The sailors started up with\nlooks of surprise.\n\n\"Look sharp, men!\" the mate said. \"We shall have wind, and plenty of\nit. It will be here before long.\"\n\nThe men, who were by no means sorry for a spell of work after going so\nlong without shifting sail or tack, worked hard, and the white sheets\nof canvas were soon snugly furled. By this time all the sailors who had\nbeen to sea for any time recognized the utility of their work. The low\nbank had risen and extended the whole width of the western horizon.\n\n\"What do you think, Mr. Prendergast? Have we got enough off her?\"\n\n\"I don't know about your storms here, Captain; but if it were in the\nLevant I should get every stitch of canvas off her excepting\nclosely-reefed topsails, a storm jib, and fore stay-sail. The first\nburst over, one can always shake out more canvas. However, you know\nthese seas, and I do not.\"\n\n\"I think you are right. These pamperos, as we call them, are not to be\ntrifled with.\"\n\n\"In that case there is no time to be lost, Captain, and with your\npermission I will lend a hand.\"\n\n\"All hands take in sail!\" the captain shouted.\n\nThe mate led the way up the starboard shrouds, while Harry, throwing\noff his coat, mounted those to port, closely followed by Bertie. Five\nminutes' hard work, and the _Para_ was stripped for the struggle.\n\n\"That is a good job done,\" the skipper said to Harry as he reached the\ndeck.\n\n\"A very good job, sir. The wind may come, but we are prepared for it;\nthere is nothing like being ready in time.\"\n\n\"She is in good trim for it,\" said the captain, \"not above two-thirds\nladen, and as the wind is off the land, there is nothing to worry us\nexcept the Falklands. I shall go outside them. Of course that will\nlengthen the voyage, but with this westerly wind I should not care\nabout being between them and the mainland. You think the same, Mr.\nPrendergast?\"\n\n\"I do, sir; they are a scattered group, and it would not be pleasant to\nhave them under lee.\"\n\nIt had grown sensibly darker, but the line of mist had not risen\nhigher. Harry remarked upon this.\n\n\"I almost doubt whether it is coming after all,\" he said.\n\nThe captain shook his head.\n\n\"It does not spread over the sky,\" he said, \"because it is largely dust\nblown off the land. After the first burst you will see that we shall\nhave a bright blue sky and a roaring wind, just as one gets it\nsometimes in an easterly gale in the Channel. We shall have it in\nanother five minutes, I fancy. I don't think it will be very strong, or\nwe should have had it here before this.\"\n\nIt was not long before a dull, moaning sound was heard, the brown-red\nfog changed its appearance, swirls of vapour seemed to dash out in\nfront of it, and the whole swelled and heaved as if it were being\npushed forward by some tremendous pressure in its rear.\n\nThe ship's head was pointing nearly east, the canvas hung down\nmotionless, and there was not a breath of wind.\n\n\"Hold on all!\" the captain shouted. Half a minute later the billowly\nclouds swept across the vessel, and a sudden darkness overspread them.\nThen there was a glow of white light, a line of foam approached as\nfleet as a race-horse, and with a shriek the gale was upon them. The\nvessel shook from stem to stern as if she had struck against a rock,\nand her bow was pressed down lower and lower until she seemed as if she\nwere going to dive head-foremost. But as she gathered way, her bow\nrose, and in a minute she was flying along at some eighteen knots an\nhour.\n\n\"She is all right now, Mr. Prendergast,\" the captain said. \"It is well\nwe stripped her so thoroughly, and that she is not heavily laden.\"\n\nFour men had been placed at the wheel, and it needed all their strength\nto keep her from yawing. In half an hour the sea began to get up, and\nthe captain laid her course south-east, which put the wind on her\nquarter.\n\n\"It is well we were not a degree or so farther south, Captain.\"\n\n\"Yes; it would have been as much as we could do to weather the\nFalklands; for with this small amount of sail we should have made a\nterrible amount of leeway. As it is, all is fair sailing.\"\n\nThe darkness gradually passed away, and in an hour after the gale had\nstruck her the _Para_ was sailing under a bright blue sky. Although but\nfew points off the wind, she was lying down till her lee scuppers were\nunder water. The spray was flying over her sparkling in the sun; the\nsailors were crouched under the weather bulwark, lashed to\nbelaying-pins and stanchions to prevent themselves from shifting down\nto leewards. Six hours later it was evident that there was some slight\ndiminution in the force of the wind.\n\n\"She is going about fourteen knots now,\" the captain said; \"we can head\nher more to the south. We must be nearly abreast of the islands, and\naccording to my reckoning forty or fifty miles to the east of them.\"\n\nIt was now dark, and the watch was sent below.\n\n\"To-morrow morning we shall be able to get some more sail on her,\" the\nmaster said, \"and I hope by the next morning the squall will be over,\nfor we shall then have made our southing, and the wind will be right in\nour teeth when we turn her head west. There is no saying which way it\nwill come when the squall dies out. What do you think, Johnson?\"\n\n\"We are pretty sure to get it hot from one quarter or another,\" the man\nsaid. \"I should say most likely from the south.\"\n\n\"Except for the cold that would be better than west,\" Harry remarked.\n\n\"Yes, if it is not too strong; but it is likely to be strong. After\nsuch a gale as we have had, it seldom settles down for some time. As\nlike as not there will be bad weather for the next month.\"\n\nThe next morning when Harry went on deck he saw that the reefs had been\nshaken out of the topsails and the spanker hoisted. There was still a\nfresh wind, but it had backed round more to the south, and there was so\nsharp a nip in it that he went below and put on a pea-jacket. Then he\nbeckoned to Bertie, who was off duty, to join him on the poop.\n\n\"That has been a smart blow, Bertie.\"\n\n\"Yes, but I had it worse than that the last time I came round the Horn.\nI think we shall be shortening sail again before long. The clouds are\nbanking up to the south-west. She is a good sea-boat, isn't she?\"\n\n\"She has behaved uncommonly well. We shall want all our clothes before\nnight, Bertie. It was May when we started, and it is nearly mid-winter\ndown here.\"\n\n\"There is one thing, we shan't have so much risk of coming across\ndrifting icebergs, most of them will be frozen up hard and fast down in\nthe south. They don't matter much when the weather is clear, but if it\nis thick one has an awful time of it. On my first voyage it was like\nthat, and I tell you I didn't think I was going to see England again.\nWe had some desperately close shaves.\"\n\nThe wind speedily freshened, and by evening the ship was under\nclose-reefed canvas again. The clouds were flying fast overhead and the\nair was thick. Before the evening watch was set the ship was brought\nround on the other tack, and was running to the east of south.\n\n\"We will lie on this course till morning, Mr. Prendergast,\" said the\ncaptain, \"and then if the wind holds, I think we shall be able to make\na long leg and weather the Horn.\"\n\nFor six days the storm raged with unabated violence. The cold was\nintense, the spray breaking over the bows froze as it fell, and the\ncrew were engaged for hours at a time in breaking up the masses of ice\nthus formed. Harry had volunteered to take a watch in turn with the\nfirst and second mates. The captain was almost continuously on deck.\nTwice they encountered icebergs, and once in a driving snow-storm\nnearly ran foul of one. Fortunately it was daylight, and the whole crew\nbeing on deck, they were able to put the vessel about just in time.\nDuring this time the vessel had only gained a few miles' westing. All\non board were utterly exhausted with the struggle against the bitter\nwind; their hands were sore and bleeding through pulling upon frozen\nropes, their faces inflamed, and their eyelids so swollen and sore that\nthey could scarcely see. Then the wind began to abate, and more sail\nbeing got on the _Para_, she was able to lie her course.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nAT LIMA\n\n\nThree days later the sky cleared, and the captain, getting an\nobservation, found that they had rounded the southernmost point of the\nCape. Another day and the _Para's_ head was turned north, and a week\nlater they were running smoothly along before a gentle breeze, with the\ncoast of Chili twenty miles away. The heavy wraps had all been laid\naside, and although the air was still frosty, the crew felt it warm\nafter what they had endured. The upper spars and yards had all been\nsent up, and she was now carrying a crowd of canvas. The mate had\nthawed out under the more congenial surroundings. He had worked like a\nhorse during the storm, setting an example, whether in going aloft or\nin the work of clearing off the ice from the bows, and even when his\nwatch was relieved he seldom went below.\n\n\"Well, I hope, Mr. Johnson, we shall sail together until you get your\nnext step,\" the captain said. \"I could not wish for a better first\nofficer.\"\n\n\"I want nothing better, sir. She is a fine ship, well manned and well\ncommanded. I begin to feel at home in her now; at first I didn't. I\nhate changes; and though the last captain I sailed with was a surly\nfellow, we got on very well together. I would rather sail with a man\nlike that than with a skipper who is always talking. I am a silent man\nmyself, and am quite content to eat my meal and enjoy it, without\nhaving to stop every time I am putting my fork into my mouth to answer\nsome question or other. I was once six months up in the north without\never speaking to a soul. I was whaling then, and a snow-storm came on\nwhen we were fast on to a fish. It was twenty-four hours before it\ncleared off, and when it did there was no ship to be seen. We were in\nan inlet at the time in Baffin's Bay. We thought that the ship would\ncome back, and we landed and hauled up the boat. The ship didn't come\nback, and, as I learned long afterwards, was never heard of again. I\nsuppose she got nipped between two icebergs.\n\n\"Winter was coming on fast, and the men all agreed that they would\nrather try and make their way south overland than stay there. I told\nthem that they were fools, but I admit that the prospect of a winter\nthere was enough to frighten any man. I did not like it myself, but I\nthought it was wiser to remain there than to move. Some of the men went\nalong the shore, or out in the boat, and managed to kill several\nsea-cows. They made a sledge, piled the meat on it, and started.\n\n\"Meanwhile I had been busy building a sort of hut. I piled great stones\nagainst the foot of the cliffs, and turned the boat upside down to form\na roof. The men helped me to do that job the last thing before they\nstarted. Then I blocked up the entrance, leaving only just room for me\nto crawl in and out. The snow began to fall steadily three days after\nthe others had gone, and very soon covered my hut two feet deep. I\nmelted the blubber of the whale in the boat's baler, for we had towed\nthe fish ashore. The first potful or two I boiled over a few bits of\ndrift-wood. After that it was easy enough, as I unravelled some of the\nboat's rope, dipped it in the hot blubber, and made a store of big\ncandles. There was a lot of meat left on the sea-cows, so I cut that\nup, froze it, and stowed as much as I could in the hut. I was bothered\nabout the rest, as I knew the bears were likely to come down; but I\nfound a ledge on the face of the perpendicular rock, and by putting the\nboat's mast against it I was able to get up to it. Here I piled, I\nshould say, a ton of meat and blubber. Then I set to work and collected\nsome dried grass, and soon I had enough to serve as bed and covers. It\ntook me a month to do all this, and by that time winter was down on me\nin earnest. I had spent my evenings in making myself, out of the skins\nof the three cows, breeches, high boots, and a coat with a hood over\nthe head, and in order to make these soft I rubbed them with hot oil.\nThey were rough things, but I hoped that I might get a bear later on.\nFortunately the boat had two balers, for I required one in which to\nmelt the snow over the lamp.\n\n\"Well, sir, I lived there during that winter. I did not find it\naltogether dull, for I had several bits of excitement. For a month or\nso bears and wolves came down and fought over the carcass of the whale.\nWhen that was eaten up they turned their attention to me, and over and\nover again they tried to break in. They had better have left me alone,\nfor though they were strong enough to have pulled away the rocks that\nblocked the entrance, they could not stand fire. As I had any amount of\nrope, I used to soak it in rock-oil, set it on fire, and shove it out\nof the entrance. Twice small bears managed to wriggle up the passage,\nbut I had sharpened the boat-hook and managed to kill them both. One\nskin made me a whole suit, and the other a first-rate blanket. Not that\nit was ever unpleasantly cold, for a couple of my big candles, and the\nthick coating of snow over it, kept the place as warm as I cared for.\nOccasionally, when the bears had cleared off, I went out, climbed the\nmast, and got fresh supplies down. They had made desperate efforts to\nget at the meat, but the face of the rock was luckily too smooth for\nthem to get any hold. When spring came and the ice broke up, I planted\nthe mast on the top of the cliff with the sail fastened as a flag, and\na month after the sea was clear a whaler came in and took me off. That\nwas how I pretty well lost the use of my tongue, and though I am better\nthan I was, I don't use it much now except on duty.\"\n\n\"That certainly accounts for it,\" Harry said; \"you must have had an\nawful time.\"\n\n\"I don't think I minded it very much, sir. Except when I was bothered\nby the bears I slept a good lot. I think at first I used to talk out\nloud a good deal. But I soon dropped that, though I used to whistle\nsometimes when I was cooking the food. I don't think I should have held\non so long if I had only had the sea-cow flesh, but the bears made a\nnice change, and I only wished that one or two more had managed to\ncrawl in.\"\n\n\"I wonder you were able to kill them with a boat-hook.\"\n\n\"I didn't, sir. You know every whaler carries an axe to cut the line if\nnecessary, and I was able to split their skulls as they crawled in\nbefore they could get fairly on to their feet and use their paws. I was\ngetting very weak with scurvy towards the end; but as soon as the snow\nmelted plants began to shoot, and I was able to collect green stuff, so\nthat I was nearly well by the time I was picked up.\"\n\nThe weather continued fine all the time they were coasting up the\nChilian coast. They were a week at Valparaiso getting out the cargo\nthey had brought for that town, and did some trading at smaller ports;\nbut at last, just four months after leaving England, they dropped\nanchor off Callao. \"Well, it has been a jolly voyage, Harry,\" his\nbrother said as they were rowed ashore, after a hearty farewell from\nthe captain and the first officer.\n\n\"I am glad you enjoyed it, Bertie. I was sorry all the time I hadn't\ntaken a passage for you aft.\"\n\n\"I am better pleased to have been at work; it would have been awfully\nslow otherwise. The mates were both good fellows, and I got on well\nwith the other apprentices. I tried at first not to turn out on night\nwatch, as I was not obliged to do so, but I soon gave it up; it seemed\ndisgusting to be lying there when the others had to turn out. It has\nbeen a jolly voyage, but I am glad that we are here at last, and are\ngoing to set to work in search of treasures.\"\n\n\"I had begun to think that we should not get on shore to-day,\" Harry\nsaid as they neared the landing-place. \"What with three hours' waiting\nfor the medical officer, and another three for that bumptious official\nwhom they call the port officer, and without whose permission no one is\nallowed to land, I think everyone on board was so disgusted that we\nshould have liked nothing better than to pitch the fellow overboard. It\nwas rather amusing to watch all those boatmen crowding round shouting\nthe praises of their own craft and running down the others. But a\nlittle of it goes a long way. It is the same pretty nearly at every\nport I have entered. Boatmen are harpies of the worst kind. It is lucky\nthat we had so little baggage; a tip of a couple of dollars was enough\nto render the custom-house officer not only civil but servile.\"\n\nAs they mounted the steps they were assailed by a motley crowd, half of\nwhom struggled to get near them to hold out their hands for alms, while\nthe other half struggled and fought for the right of carrying their\nbaggage. Accustomed to such scenes, Harry at once seized upon two of\nthem, gave them the portmanteaux, and, keeping behind them, pushed them\nthrough the crowd, telling them to lead the way to the hotel that the\ncaptain had recommended as being the least filthy in the place. They\ncrossed a square covered with goods of all kinds. There were long rows\nof great jars filled with native spirit, bales of cinchona bark, piles\nof wheat from Chili, white and rose- blocks of salt, pyramids\nof unrefined sugar, and a block of great bars of silver; among these\nagain were bales and boxes landed from foreign countries, logs of\ntimber, and old anchors and chains. Numbers of people who appeared to\nhave nothing to do sauntered about or sat on logs. In odd corners were\nnative women engaged in making the picanties upon which the poor\nlargely exist; these were composed of fresh and salt meat, potatoes,\ncrabs, the juice of bitter oranges, lard, salt, and an abundance of\npepper pods.\n\n\"That is the sort of thing we shall have to eat, Bertie.\"\n\n\"Well, I should not mind if I had not got to look on at the making;\nthey smell uncommonly good.\"\n\nThe hotel was larger and even more dirty than the captain's description\nhad led them to expect. However, the dinner that was served to them was\nbetter than they had looked for, and being very hungry after their long\nwait, they did full justice to it.\n\n\"It might have been a good deal worse, Bertie.\"\n\n\"I should think so; after four months of salt junk it is splendid!\"\n\nA cup of really good coffee, followed by a little glass of native\nspirits, added to their satisfaction. They had hesitated before whether\nto push on at once to Lima or wait there till next morning. Their meal\ndecided them--they would start at daybreak, so as to get to Lima before\nthe sun became really hot. Harry asked the landlord to bargain for two\nriding mules and one for baggage to be ready at that hour, and they\nthen strolled out to view the place, although Bertie assured his\nbrother that there was nothing whatever to see in it.\n\n\"That may be, Bertie; but we are not going to begin by being lazy.\nThere is always something to see in foreign lands by those who keep\ntheir eyes open.\"\n\nAfter an hour's walk Harry was inclined to think that his brother was\nright. The houses were generally constructed of canes, plastered with\nmud, and painted yellow. As the result of earthquakes, scarce a house\nstood upright--some leaned sideways, and looked as if they were going\nto topple over into the road; while others leaned back, as if, were you\nto push against them, they would collapse and crush the inmates.\n\nTheir night was not a pleasant one. The beds were simple, consisting\nonly of hides stretched across wooden frames, but, as they very\nspeedily found, there were numerous other inhabitants. They therefore\nslept but little, and were heartily glad when the first gleam of dawn\nappeared.\n\nSlipping on their clothes, they ran down to the shore and had a bath.\nBy the time they returned breakfast was ready--coffee, fish, and eggs.\nThe mules did not appear for another hour, by which time their patience\nwas all but exhausted. The portmanteaux were speedily strapped on to\nthe back of the baggage mule, and they mounted the two others. The\nmuleteer had brought one for himself, and, fastening the baggage animal\nbehind it, they started.\n\nIt was six miles to Lima, but as the city is five hundred and twelve\nfeet above the sea, the ascent was steady and somewhat steep. The road\nwas desperately bad, and the country uninteresting, being for the most\npart dried up. Occasionally they saw great mounds of adobe bricks, the\nremains of the ancient habitations. As they neared the town vegetation\nbecame general, small canals irrigating the country. Here were fruit\nand vegetable gardens, with oranges, plantains, vines, and flowers.\n\nPassing through a gate in the walls they entered the town, which\nafforded a pleasant contrast to the squalid misery of Callao. The city,\nhowever, could not be called imposing; the houses were low and\nirregular, fantastically painted in squares or stripes, and almost all\nhad great balconies shut in with trellis-work.\n\nFew of the houses had any windows towards the street, the larger ones\nbeing constructed with a central courtyard, into which the rooms all\nopened. The streets were all built at right angles, the principal ones\nleading from the grand square, in which stood the cathedral and the\npalace of the Spanish viceroys, the other sides consisting of private\nhouses, with shops and arcades below them. The hotel to which they had\nbeen recommended was a large building with a courtyard, with dining and\nother rooms opening from it, and above them the bedrooms. In comparison\nwith the inn at Callao it was magnificent, but in point of cleanliness\nit left a great deal to be desired. After settling themselves in their\nroom they went out. The change in temperature since they had left\nCallao had been very great.\n\n\"The first thing to do, Bertie, is to buy ourselves a couple of good\nponchos. You see all the natives are wearing them.\"\n\n\"We certainly want something of the sort, Harry. I thought it was heat\nthat we were going to suffer from, but it seems just the other way. To\njudge from the temperature we might be in Scotland, and this damp mist\nchills one to the bone.\"\n\n\"I am not much surprised, for of course I got the subject up as much as\nI could before starting; and Barnett told me that Lima was altogether\nan exceptional place, and that while it was bright and warm during the\nwinter months, from May till November on the plains only a few miles\naway, even in the summer months there was almost always a clammy mist\nat Lima, and that inside the house as well as outside everything\nstreamed with moisture. He said that this had never been satisfactorily\naccounted for. Some say that it is due to the coldness of the river\nhere--the Rimac--which comes down from the snowy mountains. Others\nthink that the cold wind that always blows down the valley of the river\nmeets the winds from the sea here, and the moisture contained in them\nis thus precipitated. I believe that a few miles higher up we shall get\nout of this atmosphere altogether. Still, the ponchos will be very\nuseful, for it will be really cold up in the mountains. They serve for\ncloaks in the daytime and blankets at night. The best are made of the\nwool of the guanacos, a sort of llama. Their wool is very fine, and\nbefore we start we will get two of coarser wool to use as blankets to\nsleep on, while we have the finer ones to cover us.\"\n\nThere was no difficulty in finding a shop with the goods they wanted,\nand the prices, even of the best, were very moderate. They next bought\ntwo soft felt hats with broad brims.\n\n\"That is ever so much more comfortable. We will wait until to-morrow\nbefore we begin what we may call business, Bertie. Of course I shall\ndeliver the other letters of introduction that Mr. Barnett gave me; but\nthe principal one--that to his former muleteer--is more important than\nall put together. If anything has happened to him, there is an end of\nany chance whatever of finding treasure. Of course he may have moved\naway, or be absent on a journey with his mules, in which case we shall\nhave either to follow him or wait for his return.\"\n\n\"That would be a frightful nuisance.\"\n\n\"Yes; still, it is one of the things that we foresaw might happen.\"\n\n\"I vote we go at once, Harry, and see if he is here.\"\n\n\"I don't think we shall find him here; for Barnett said that he lived\nin the village of Miraflores, five miles away on the north, and that if\nhe is not there, Senor Pasquez, to whom I have a letter, will be likely\nto tell me where he is to be found, for he is often employed by him.\nHowever, I am as anxious as you to see him. As it is only eleven\no'clock yet, there is no reason why we should not go to Miraflores.\nThey will get mules for us at the hotel, and tell us which road to\ntake.\"\n\nIt was not necessary, however, to go into the hotel, for when they\nreturned, two or three men with mules were waiting to be hired. They\nengaged two animals, and as the man of whom they hired them had a\nthird, and he was ready to accompany them for a small fee, they agreed\nto take him with them.\n\nBefore they were a mile out of the town the mist cleared off and the\nsun shone brightly. The heat, however, was by no means too great to be\npleasant. Miraflores was a charming village, or rather small town,\nnestling among gardens and orchards.\n\n\"I want to find a muleteer named Dias Otero,\" Harry said to their guide\nas they rode into the place.\n\n\"I know him well,\" he said. \"Everyone about here knows Dias. His wife\nwas a cousin of my mother's.\"\n\n\"Do you know whether he is at home now?\"\n\n\"Yes, senor; I saw him in Lima three days ago. He had just come down\nfrom the mountains. He had been away two months, and certainly will not\nhave started again so soon. Shall I lead you to his house at once?\"\n\n\"Do so; it is to see him that I have come to this town. He worked for a\nlong time with a friend of mine some years ago, and I have brought a\nmessage from him. I may be some time talking with him, so when I go in\nyou can tie up your mules for a while.\"\n\n\"That is his house,\" the man said presently.\n\nIt lay in the outskirts of the town, and was neater than the generality\nof houses, and the garden was a mass of flowers. They dismounted,\nhanded over the mules to their owner, and walked to the door. An Indian\nof some five-and-forty years came out as they did so.\n\n\"Are you Dias Otero?\" Harry asked.\n\n\"The same, senor.\"\n\n\"I have just arrived from England, and bring a letter to you from Senor\nBarnett, with whom you travelled for two or three years some time ago.\"\n\nThe man's face lit up with pleasure. \"Will you enter, senor. Friends of\nSenor Barnett may command my services in any way. It is a delight to\nhear from him. He writes to me sometimes, but in these troubles letters\ndo not always come. I love the senor; there never was a kinder master.\nHe once saved my life at the risk of his own. Is there any hope of his\ncoming out again?\"\n\n\"I do not think so, Dias. He is strong and well, but I do not think he\nis likely to start again on a journey of exploration. He is my greatest\nfriend. My brother and I were left under his charge when we were young,\nand he has been almost a father to us. It is he who has sent us out to\nyou. Here is his letter.\"\n\n\"Will you read it to me, senor. I cannot read; I am always obliged to\nget somebody to read my letters, and write answers for me.\"\n\nThe letter was of course in Spanish, and Harry read:\n\n\"Dear friend Dias,\n\n\"I am sending out to you a gentleman, Mr. Prendergast, an officer of\nthe British Navy, in whom I am deeply interested. His brother\naccompanies him. I beg that you will treat them as you would me, and\nevery service you can render him consider as rendered to myself. From a\nreason which he will no doubt explain to you in time, it is of the\ndeepest importance to him that he should grow rich in the course of the\nnext two years. He asked my advice, and I said to him, 'There is no one\nI know of who could possibly put you in the way of so doing better than\nmy friend Dias Otero. I believe it is in his power to do so if he is\nwilling.' I also believe that for my sake you will aid him. He will\nplace himself wholly in your hands. He does not care what danger he\nruns, or what hardships he has to go through in order to attain his\npurpose. I know that I need not say more to you. He has two years\nbefore him; long before that I am sure you will be as interested in him\nas you were in me. He has sufficient means to pay all expenses of\ntravel for the time he will be out there. I know that you are descended\nfrom nobles of high rank at the court of the Incas when the Spaniards\narrived, and that secrets known to but few were passed down from father\nto son in your family. If you can use any of those secrets to the\nadvantage of my friend, I pray you most earnestly to do so. I trust\nthat this letter will find you and your good wife in health. Had I been\nten years younger I would have come out with my friends to aid them in\ntheir adventure, but I know that in putting them into your hands I\nshall be doing them a vastly greater service than I could do were I\nable to come in person.\"\n\nWhen Harry ceased, the Indian sat for some time without speaking, then\nhe said:\n\n\"It is a matter that I must think over, senor. It is a very grave one,\nand had any other man than Senor Barnett asked this service of me no\nmoney could have tempted me to assent to it. It is not only that my\nlife would be in danger, but that my name would be held up to\nexecration by all my people were I to divulge the secret that even the\ntortures of the Spaniards could not wring from us. I must think it over\nbefore I answer. I suppose you are staying at the Hotel Morin; I will\ncall and see you when I have thought the matter over. It is a grave\nquestion, and it may be three or four days before I can decide.\"\n\n\"I thank you, Dias; but there is no occasion for you to give a final\ndecision now. Whether or no, we shall travel for a while, and I trust\nthat you will go with us with your mules and be our guide, as you did\nto Mr. Barnett. It will be time enough when you know us better to give\nus a final answer; it is not to be expected that even for Senor\nBarnett's sake you would do this immense service for strangers,\ntherefore I pray you to leave the matter open. Make arrangements for\nyour mules and yourself for a three months' journey in the mountains,\nshow us what there is to see of the gold and silver placers, and the\nquicksilver mines at Huanuco. At the end of that time you will know us\nand can say whether you are ready to aid us in our search.\"\n\nThe native bowed his head gravely.\n\n\"I will think it over,\" he said; \"and now, senors, let us put that\naside. My wife has been busy since you entered in preparing a simple\nmeal, and I ask you to honour me by partaking of it.\"\n\n\"With pleasure, Dias.\"\n\nIt consisted of _puchero_, a stew consisting of a piece of beef,\ncabbage, sweet-potatoes, salt pork, sausage-meat, pigs' feet, yuccas,\nbananas, quinces, peas, rice, salt, and an abundance of Chili peppers.\nThis had been cooked for six hours and was now warmed up. Two bottles\nof excellent native wine, a flask of spirits, and some water were also\nput on the table. The Indian declined to sit down with them, saying\nthat he had taken a meal an hour before.\n\nWhile they ate he chatted with them, asking questions of their voyage\nand telling them of the state of things in the country.\n\n\"It is always the same, senors, there is a revolution and two or three\nbattles; then either the president or the one who wants to be president\nescapes from the country or is taken and shot, and in a day or two\nthere is a fresh pronunciamiento. We thought that when the Spaniards\nhad been driven out we should have had peace, but it is not so; we have\nhad San Martin, and Bolivar, and Aguero, and Santa Cruz, and Sucre.\nBolivar again finally defeated the Spaniards at Ayacucho. Rodil held\npossession of Callao castle, and defended it until January of this\nyear. We in the villages have not suffered--those who liked fighting\nwent out with one or other of the generals; some have returned, others\nhave been killed--but Lima has suffered greatly. Sometimes the people\nhave taken one side, sometimes the other, and though the general they\nsupported was sometimes victorious for a short time, in the end they\nsuffered. Most of the old Spanish families perished; numbers died in\nthe castle of Callao, where many thousands of the best blood of Lima\ntook refuge, and of these well-nigh half died of hunger and misery\nbefore Rodil surrendered.\"\n\n\"But does not this make travelling very unsafe?\"\n\nThe Indian shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"Peru is a large country, senor, and those who want to keep out of the\nway of the armies and lighting can do so; I myself have continued my\noccupation and have never fallen in with the armies. That is because\nthe fighting is principally in the plains, or round Cuzco; for the men\ndo not go into the mountains except as fugitives, as they could not\nfind food there for an army. It is these fugitives who render the road\nsomewhat unsafe; starving men must take what they can get. They do not\ninterfere with the great silver convoys from Potosi or other mines--a\nloaf of bread is worth more than a bar of silver in the mountains--but\nthey will plunder persons coming down with goods to the town or going\nup with their purchases. Once or twice I have had to give up the food I\ncarried with me, but I have had little to grumble at, and I do not\nthink you need trouble yourself about them; we will take care to avoid\nthem as far as possible.\"\n\nAfter chatting for an hour they left the cottage, and, mounting their\nmules, returned to Lima.\n\n\"I think he will help us, Harry,\" Bertie said as soon as they set out.\n\n\"I think so too, but we must not press him to begin with. Of course\nthere is a question too as to how far he can help us. He may know\nvaguely where the rich mines once existed; but you must remember that\nthey have been lost for three hundred years, and it may be impossible\nfor even a man who has received the traditions as to their positions to\nhit upon the precise spot. The mountains, you see, are tremendous;\nthere must be innumerable ravines and gorges among them. It is certain\nthat nothing approaching an accurate map can ever have been made of the\nmountains, and I should say that in most cases the indications that may\nhave been given are very vague. They would no doubt have been\nsufficient for those who lived soon after the money was hidden, and\nwere natives of that part of the country and thoroughly acquainted with\nall the surroundings, but when the information came to be handed down\nfrom mouth to mouth during many generations, the local knowledge would\nbe lost, and what were at first detailed instructions would become\nlittle better than vague legends. You know how three hundred years will\nalter the face of a country--rocks roll down the hills, torrents wash\naway the soil, forests grow or are cleared away. I believe with you\nthat the Indian will do his best, but I have grave doubts whether he\nwill be able to locate any big thing.\"\n\n\"Well, you don't take a very cheerful view of things, Harry; you\ncertainly seemed more hopeful when we first started.\"\n\n\"Yes. I don't say I am not hopeful still, but it is one thing to plan\nout an enterprise at a distance and quite another when you are face to\nface with its execution. As we have come down the coast, and seen that\ngreat range of mountains stretching along for hundreds of miles, and we\nknow that there is another quite as big lying behind it, I have begun\nto realize the difficulties of the adventures that we are undertaking.\nHowever, we shall hear, when Dias comes over to see us, what he thinks\nof the matter. I fancy he will say that he is willing to go with us and\nhelp us as far as he can, but that although he will do his best he\ncannot promise that he will be able to point out, with anything like\ncertainty, the position of any of the old mines.\"\n\nNext day they called on Senor Pasquez, who received them very cordially.\n\n\"So you are going to follow the example of Senor Barnett and spend some\ntime in exploring the country and doing some shooting. Have you found\nDias?\"\n\n\"Yes, senor, and I think he will go with us, though he has not given a\npositive answer.\"\n\n\"You will be fortunate if you get him; he is one of the best-known\nmuleteers in the country, and if anyone comes here and wants a guide\nDias is sure to be the first to be recommended. If he goes with you he\ncan give you much useful advice; he knows exactly what you will have to\ntake with you, the best districts to visit for your purpose, and the\nbest way of getting there. For the rest, I shall be very happy to take\ncharge of any money you may wish to leave behind, and to act as your\nbanker and cash any orders you may draw upon me. I will also receive\nand place to your account any sums that may be sent you from England.\"\n\n\"That, sir, is a matter which Mr. Barnett advised me to place in your\nhands. After making what few purchases we require, and taking fifty\npounds in silver, I shall have two hundred and fifty pounds to place in\nyour hands. Mr. Barnett will manage my affairs in my absence, and will\nsend to you fifty pounds quarterly.\"\n\n\"You will find difficulty in spending it all in two years,\" the\nmerchant said with a smile. \"If you are content to live on what can be\nbought in the country, it costs very little; and as for the mules, they\ncan generally pick up enough at their halting-places to serve them,\nwith a small allowance of grain. You can hire them cheaply, or you can\nbuy them. The latter is cheaper in the end, but you cannot be sure of\ngetting mules accustomed to mountains, and you would therefore run the\nrisk of their losing their foothold, and not only being dashed to\npieces but destroying their saddles and loads. However, if you secure\nthe services of Dias Otero, you will get mules that know every path in\nthe mountains. He is famous for his animals, and he himself is\nconsidered the most trusty muleteer here; men think themselves lucky in\nobtaining his services. I would send him with loads of uncounted gold\nand should be sure that there would not be a piece missing.\"\n\nNext day Dias came to the hotel.\n\n\"I have thought it over, senor,\" he said. \"I need not say that were it\nonly ordinary service, instead of exploring the mountains, I should be\nglad indeed to do my best for a friend of Senor Barnett; but as to the\nreal purpose of your journey I wish, before making any arrangement,\nthat the matter should be thoroughly understood. I have no certain\nknowledge whatever as to any of the lost mines, still less of any\nhidden treasures; but I know all the traditions that have passed down\nconcerning them. I doubt whether any Indians now possess a certain\nknowledge of these things. For generations, no doubt, the secrets were\nhanded down from father to son, and it is possible that some few may\nstill know of these places; but I doubt it. Think of the hundreds and\nthousands of our people who have been killed in battle, or died as\nslaves in the mines, and you will see that numbers of those to whom the\nsecrets were entrusted must have taken their knowledge to the grave\nwith them.\n\n\"In each generation the number of those who knew the particulars of\nthese hiding-places must have diminished. Few now can know more than I\ndo, yet I am sure of nothing. I know generally where the mines were\nsituated and where some treasures were concealed, and what knowledge I\nhave I will place at your service; but so great a care was used in the\nconcealment of the entrances to the mines, so carefully were the\nhiding-places of the treasures chosen, and so cunningly concealed,\nthat, without the surest indications and the most minute instructions,\nwe might search for years, as men indeed have done ever since the\nSpanish came here, without finding them. I am glad that I can lay my\nhand upon my heart and say, that whatever may have been possessed by\nancestors of mine, no actual details have ever come down to me; for,\nhad it been so, I could not have revealed them to you. We know that all\nwho were instructed in these were bound by the most terrible oaths not\nto reveal them. Numbers have died under the torture rather than break\nthose oaths; and even now, were one of us to betray the secrets that\nhad come down to him, he would be regarded as accursed. No one would\nbreak bread with him, every door would be closed against him, and if he\ndied his body would rot where it fell. But my knowledge is merely\ngeneral, gathered not only from the traditions known to all our people,\nbut from confidences made by one member of our family to another. Full\nknowledge was undoubtedly given to some of them; but all these must\nhave died without initiating others into the full particulars. Such\nknowledge as I have is at your disposal. I can take you to the\nlocalities, I can say to you, 'Near this place was a great mine,' but\nunless chance favours you you may search in vain.\"\n\n\"That is quite as much as I had hoped for, Dias, and I am grateful for\nyour willingness to do what you can for us, just as you did for Senor\nBarnett.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nA STREET FRAY\n\n\n\"Now, senor,\" Dias said, \"as we have settled the main point, let us\ntalk over the arrangements. What is the weight of your baggage?\"\n\n\"Not more than a mule could carry. Of course we shall sling our rifles\nover our shoulders. We have a good stock of ammunition for them and for\nour pistols. We shall each take two suits of clothes besides those we\nwear, and a case of spirits in the event of accident or illness. We\nshall each have three flannel shirts, stockings, and so on, but\ncertainly everything belonging to us personally would not mount up to\nmore than a hundred and fifty pounds. We should, of course, require a\nfew cooking utensils, tin plates, mugs, and cups. What should we need\nbesides these?\"\n\n\"A tent and bedding, senor. We should only have, at the start, to carry\nsuch provisions as we could not buy. When we are beyond the range of\nvillages in the forests we might often be weeks without being able to\nbuy anything; still, we should probably be able to shoot game for food.\nWe should find fruits, but flour we shall have to take with us from the\nlast town we pass through before we strike into the mountains, and\ndried meat for an emergency; and it would be well to have a bag of\ngrain, so that we could give a handful or so to each of the mules. I am\nglad you have brought some good spirits--we shall need it in the swamps\nby the rivers. Your tea and coffee will save your having to buy them\nhere, but you will want some sugar. We must take two picks and a\nshovel, a hammer for breaking up ore, a small furnace, twenty crucibles\nand bellows, and a few other things for aiding to melt the ore. You\nwould want for the journey five baggage mules, and, of course, three\nriding mules. I could hardly manage them, even with aid from you, in\nvery bad places, and I would rather not take any strange man with me on\nsuch business as we have in hand. But some assistance I must have, and\nI will take with me my nephew Jose. He has lost his father, and I have\ntaken him as my assistant, and shall train him to be a guide such as I\nam. He is but fifteen, but he already knows something of his business,\nand such an expedition will teach him more than he would learn in ten\nyears on the roads.\"\n\n\"That would certainly be far better than having a muleteer whom you\ncould not trust, Dias. My brother and myself will be ready to lend you\na hand whenever you want help of any kind. We have not had any\nexperience with mules, but sailors can generally turn their hands to\nanything. Now, how about the eight mules?\"\n\n\"I have five of my own, as good mules as are to be found in the\nprovince; we shall have to buy the three others for riding. Of course I\nhave saddles and ropes.\"\n\n\"But you will want four for riding.\"\n\n\"No, senor; yours and the one I ride will be enough. Jose at times will\ntake my place, and can when he likes perch on one of the most lightly\nladen animals.\"\n\n\"How much will the riding mules cost?\"\n\n\"I can get fair ones for about fifty dollars apiece; trade is slack at\npresent owing to the troubles, and there are many who would be glad to\nget rid of one or two of their train.\"\n\n\"And now, Dias, we come to the very important question, what are we to\npay you for yourself, your nephew, and the five mules--say by the\nmonth?\"\n\n\"I have been thinking the matter over, senor--I have talked it over\nwith my wife\"--he paused for a moment, and then said: \"She wishes to go\nwith me, senor.\"\n\nHarry opened his eyes in surprise. \"But surely, Dias, you could not\nthink of taking her on such an expedition, where, as you say yourself,\nyou may meet with many grave dangers and difficulties?\"\n\n\"A woman can support them as well as a man,\" Dias said quietly. \"My\nwife has more than once accompanied me on journeys when I have been\nworking on contract. We have been married for fifteen years, and she\nhas no children to keep her at home. She is accustomed to my being away\nfor weeks. This would be for months, perhaps for two years. I made no\nsecret to her that we might meet with many dangers. She says they will\nbe no greater for her than for me. At first she tried to dissuade me\nfrom going for so long a time; but when I told her that you were sent\nme by the gentleman who saved my life a year after I married her, and\nthat he had recommended you to me as standing to him almost in the\nrelation of a son, and I therefore felt bound to carry his wishes into\neffect, and so to pay the debt of gratitude that I owed him, she agreed\nat once that it was my duty to go and do all in my power for you, and\nshe prayed me to take her with me. I said that I would put it before\nyou, senor, and that I must abide by your decision.\"\n\n\"By all means bring her with you, Dias. If you and she are both willing\nto share the dangers we should meet with, surely we cannot object in\nany way.\"\n\n\"Thank you, senor; you will find her useful. You have already seen that\nshe can cook well; and if we have Jose to look after the animals when\nwe are searching among the hills, you will find it not unpleasant, when\nwe return of an evening, to find a hot supper ready for us.\"\n\n\"That is quite true, and I am sure we shall find your wife a great\nacquisition to our party. The only difference will be, that instead of\none large tent we must have two small ones--it does not matter how\nsmall, so long as we can crawl into them and they are long enough for\nus to lie down. And now about payment?\"\n\n\"I shall not overcharge you,\" Dias said with a smile. \"If my wife had\nremained behind I must have asked for money to maintain her while we\nwere away. It would not have been much, for she has her garden and her\nhouse, and there is a bag hid away with my savings, so that if she had\nbeen widowed she could still live in the house until she chose someone\nelse to share it with her; she is but thirty-two, and is as comely as\nwhen I first married her. However, as she is going with us, there will\nbe no need to trouble about her. If misfortune comes upon us and I am\nkilled, it is likely she will be killed also. We shall have no expenses\non the journey, as you will pay for food for ourselves and the animals.\nYou will remember, senor, that I make this journey not as a business\nmatter--no money would buy from me any information that I may have as\nto hidden mines or treasures,--I do it to repay a debt of gratitude to\nmy preserver, Don Henry Barnett, and partly because I am sure that I\nshall like you and your brother as I did him. I shall aid you as far as\nlies in my power in the object for which you are undertaking this\njourney. Therefore until it is finished there shall be no talk about\npayment. You may have many expenses beyond what you calculate upon. If\nwe meet with no success, and return to Lima empty-handed, I shall have\nlost nothing. I shall have had no expenses at home, my wife and I will\nhave fed at your expense, and Jose will have learned so much that he\nwould be as good a guide as any in the country. You could then give me\nthe three mules you will buy, to take the place of any of mine that may\nhave perished on the journey, and should you have them to spare, I will\ntake a hundred dollars as a _bueno mano_. If we succeed, and you\ndiscover a rich mine or a hidden treasure, you shall then pay me what\nit pleases you. Is it a bargain?\"\n\n\"The bargain you propose is ridiculously one-sided, Dias, and I don't\nsee how I could possibly accept the offer you make to me.\"\n\n\"Those are my terms, senor,\" Dias said simply, \"to take or to leave.\"\n\n\"Then I cannot but accept them, and I thank you most heartily;\" and he\nheld out his hand to Dias, and the Indian grasped it warmly.\n\n\"When do you propose we shall start?\"\n\n\"Will this day week suit you, senor? There are the mules to buy, and\nthe tents to be made--they should be of vicuna skin with the wool still\non, which, with the leather kept well oiled, will keep out water. We\nshall want them in the hills, but we shall sometimes find villages\nwhere we can sleep in shelter.\"\n\n\"Not for us, Dias. Mr. Barnett has told me that the houses are for the\nmost part alive with fleas, and I should prefer to sleep in a tent,\nhowever small, rather than lie in a bed on the floor of any one of\nthem. We don't want thick beds, you know--a couple of thicknesses of\nwell-quilted cotton, say an inch thick each, and two feet wide. You can\nget these made for us, no doubt.\"\n\nThe Indian nodded.\n\n\"That would be the best for travel; the beds the Peruvian caballeros\nuse are very thick and bulky.\"\n\n\"You will want two for yourself and your wife, and two for Jose. By the\nby, we shall want a tent for him.\"\n\nDias smiled. \"It will not be necessary, senor; muleteers are accustomed\nto sleep in the open air, and with two thick blankets, and a leathern\ncoverlet in case of rain, he will be more than comfortable. I shall\nhave five leather bags made to hold the beds and blankets. But the\nmaking of the beds and tents will take some time--people do not hurry\nin Lima,--and there will be the riding saddles and bridles to get, and\nthe provisions. I do not think we can be ready before another week. It\nwill be well, then, that you should, before starting away, visit the\nruins of Pachacamac. All travellers go there, and it will seem only\nnatural that you should do so, for there you will see the style of the\nbuildings, and also the explorations that were everywhere made by the\nSpaniards in search of treasure.\"\n\n\"Very well, Dias; then this day week we shall be ready to start.\nHowever, I suppose I shall see you every day, and learn how you are\ngetting on with your preparations.\"\n\nBertie had been sitting at the window looking down into the street\nwhile this conversation was going on. \"Well, what is it all about?\" he\nasked, turning round as the Indian left the room. \"Is it satisfactory?\"\n\n\"More than satisfactory,\" his brother answered. \"In the first place his\nnephew, a lad of fifteen, who is training as a mule-driver, is going\nwith us, which is much better than getting an outsider; in the next\nplace his wife is going with us.\"\n\n\"Good gracious!\" Bertie exclaimed, \"what in the world shall we do with\na woman?\"\n\n\"Well, I think we shall do very well with her, Bertie; but well or ill\nshe has to go. She will not let her husband go without her, which is\nnatural enough, considering how long we shall be away, and that the\njourney will be a dangerous one. But really I think she will be an\nacquisition to the party. She is bright and pretty, as you no doubt\nnoticed, and what is of more importance, she is a capital cook.\"\n\n\"She certainly gave us a good meal yesterday,\" Bertie said, \"and though\nI could rough it on anything, it is decidedly pleasanter to have a\nwell-cooked meal.\"\n\n\"Well, you see, that is all right.\"\n\n\"And how many mules are we to take?\"\n\n\"Five for baggage, and three for riding. I have no doubt Dias's wife\nwill ride behind him, and the boy, when he wants to ride, will perch\nhimself on one of the baggage mules. Dias has five mules, and we shall\nonly have to buy the three for riding.\"\n\n\"What is it all going to cost, Harry?\" Bertie said when his brother had\ntold him all the arrangements that had been made. \"That is the most\nimportant point after all.\"\n\n\"Well, you will be astonished when I tell you, Bertie, that if we don't\nsucceed in finding a treasure of any kind I shall only have to pay for\nthe three riding mules, and the expenses of food and so on, and a\nhundred dollars.\"\n\n\"Twenty pounds!\" Bertie said incredulously; \"you are joking!\"\n\n\"No, it is really so; the man said that he considered that in going\nwith me he is only fulfilling the obligation he is under to Mr.\nBarnett. Of course I protested against the terms, and would have\ninsisted upon paying the ordinary prices, whatever they might be, for\nhis services and the use of his mules; but he simply said that those\nwere the conditions on which he was willing to go with me, and that I\ncould take them or leave them, so I had to accept. I can only hope that\nwe may find some treasure, in which case only he consented to accept\nproper payment for his services.\"\n\n\"Well, it is awfully good of him,\" Bertie said; \"though really it\ndoesn't seem fair that we should be having the services of himself, his\nwife, his boy, and his mules for nothing. There is one thing, it will\nbe an extra inducement to him to try and put us in the way of finding\none of those mines.\"\n\n\"I don't think so, Bertie; he said that not for any sum of money\nwhatever would he do what he is going to do, but simply from gratitude\nto Barnett. It is curious how the traditions, or superstitions, or\nwhatever you like to call them, of the time of the Incas have continued\nto impress the Indians, and how they have preserved the secrets\nconfided to their ancestors. No doubt fear that the Spaniards would\nforce them to work in the mines till they died has had a great effect\nin inducing them to conceal the existence of these places from them.\nNow that the Spaniards have been cleared out there is no longer any\nground for apprehension of that kind, but they may still feel that the\nPeruvians would get the giant's share in any mine or treasure that\nmight be found, and that the Indians would, under one pretence or\nanother, be defrauded out of any share of it. It is not wonderful that\nit should be so considering how these poor people have been treated by\nthe whites, and it would really seem that the way in which Spain has\ngone to the dogs is a punishment for her cruelties in South America and\nthe Islands. It may be said that from the very moment when the gold\nbegan to flow the descent of Spain commenced; in spite of the enormous\nwealth she acquired she fell gradually from her position as the\ngreatest power in Europe.\n\n\"In 1525, after the battle of Pavia, Spain stood at the height of her\npower. Mexico was conquered by Cortez seven years before, Peru in 1531,\nand the wealth of those countries began to flow into Spain in enormous\nquantities, and yet her decline followed speedily. She was bearded by\nour bucaneers among the Islands and on the western coast; the\nNetherlands revolted, and after fierce fighting threw off her yoke; the\nbattle of Ivry and the accession of Henry of Navarre all but destroyed\nher influence in France; the defeat of the Armada and the capture of\nCadiz struck a fatal blow both to her power on the sea and to her\ncommerce, and within a century of the conquest of Peru, Spain was\nalready an enfeebled and decaying power. It would almost seem that the\ndiscoveries of Columbus, from which such great things were hoped,\nproved in the long run the greatest misfortune that ever befell Spain.\"\n\n\"It does look like it, Harry; however, we must hope that whatever\neffect the discovery of America had upon Portugal or Spain, it will\nmake your fortune.\"\n\nHarry laughed.\n\n\"I hope so, Bertie, but it is as well not to be too hopeful. Still, I\nhave great faith in Dias, at any rate I feel confident that he will do\nall he can; but he acknowledges that he knows nothing for certain. I am\nsure, however, that he will be a faithful guide, and that though we may\nhave a rough time, it will not be an unpleasant one. Now, you must\nbegin to turn to account what Spanish you have learned during the\nvoyage; I know you have worked regularly at it while you have not been\non duty.\"\n\n\"I have learned a good lot,\" Bertie said; \"and I dare say I could ask\nfor anything, but I should not understand the answers. I can make out a\nlot of that Spanish _Don Quixote_ you got for me, but when Dias was\ntalking to you I did not catch a word of what he was saying. I suppose\nit will all come in time.\"\n\n\"But you must begin at once. I warn you that when I am fairly off I\nshall always talk to you in Spanish, for it would look very unsociable\nif we were always talking together in English. If you ride or walk by\nthe side of the boy you will soon get on; and there will be Donna Maria\nfor you to chat away with, and from what we saw of her I should say she\nis sociably inclined. In three months I have no doubt you will talk\nSpanish as well as I do.\"\n\n\"It will be a horrid nuisance,\" Bertie grumbled; \"but I suppose it has\ngot to be done.\"\n\nThree days later Dias said he thought they might as well start the next\nday to Pachacamac.\n\n\"We shall only want the three riding mules and one for baggage. Of\ncourse we shall not take Jose or my wife. By the time we return\neverything will be ready for us.\"\n\n\"I shall be very glad to be off, Dias. We know no one here except Senor\nPasquez; and although he has been very civil and has begged us to\nconsider his house as our own, he is of course busy during the day, and\none can't do above a certain amount of walking about the streets. So by\nall means let us start to-morrow morning. We may as well go this time\nin the clothes we wear, it will be time enough to put on the things we\nhave bought when we start in earnest.\"\n\nStarting at sunrise, they rode for some distance through a fertile\nvalley, and then crossed a sandy plain until they reached the little\nvalley of Lurin, in which stand the ruins of Pachacamac. This was the\nsacred city of the natives of the coast before their conquest by the\nIncas. During their forty-mile ride Dias had told them something of the\nplace they were about to visit. Pachacamac, meaning \"the creator of the\nworld,\" was the chief divinity of these early people, and here was the\ngreat temple dedicated to him. The Incas after their conquest erected a\nvast Temple of the Sun, but they did not attempt to suppress the\nworship of Pachacamac, and the two flourished side by side until the\narrival of the Spaniards. The wealth of the temple was great; the\nSpaniards carried away among their spoils one thousand six hundred and\neighty-seven pounds of gold and one thousand six hundred ounces of\nsilver; but with all their efforts they failed to discover the main\ntreasure, said to have been no less than twenty-four thousand eight\nhundred pounds of gold, which had been carried away and buried before\ntheir arrival.\n\n\"If the Spaniards could not succeed in getting at the hiding-place,\nalthough, no doubt, they tortured everyone connected with the temple to\nmake them divulge the secret, it is evident there is no chance for us,\"\nHarry said.\n\n\"Yes, senor, they made every effort; thousands of natives were employed\nin driving passages through the terraces on which the temple stood. I\nbelieve that they did find much treasure, but certainly not the great\none they were searching for. There is no tradition among our people as\nto the hiding-place, for so many of the natives perished that all to\nwhom the secret was known must have died without revealing it to\nanybody. Had it not been so, the Spaniards would sooner or later have\nlearned it, for although hundreds have died under torture rather than\nreveal any of the hiding-places, surely one more faint-hearted than the\nrest would have disclosed them. Certain it is that at Cuzco and other\nplaces they succeeded in obtaining almost all the treasures buried\nthere, though they failed in discovering the still greater treasures\nthat had been carried away to be hidden in different spots. But\nPachacamac was a small one in comparison with Cuzco, and it was\nbelieved that the treasures had not been carried far. Tradition has it\nthat they were buried somewhere between this town and Lima. Doubtless\nall concerned in the matter fled before the Spaniards arrived, at any\nrate with all their cruelty the invaders never discovered its position.\nThe report that it was buried near may have been set about to prevent\ntheir hunting for it elsewhere, and the gold may be lying now somewhere\nin the heart of the mountains.\"\n\nHarry Prendergast and his brother looked in astonishment at the massive\nwalls that rose around the eminence on which the temple had stood. The\nlatter had disappeared, but its situation could be traced on the\nplateau buttressed by the walls. These were of immense thickness, and\nformed of huge adobe bricks almost as hard as stone; even the long\nefforts of the Spaniards had caused but little damage to them. The\nplateau rose some five hundred feet above the sea, which almost washed\none face of it. Half-way up the hill four series of these massive\nwalls, whose tops formed terraces, stood in giant steps some fifty feet\nhigh. Here and there spots of red paint could be seen, showing that the\nwhole surface was originally painted. The ascent was made by winding\npassages through the walls. On the side of the upper area facing the\nsea could be seen the remains of a sort of walk or esplanade, with\ntraces of edifices of various kinds. On a hill a mile and a half away\nwere the remains of the Incas' temple and nunnery, the style differing\nmaterially from that of the older building; it was still more damaged\nthan the temple on the hill by the searchers for treasure.\n\nPachacamac was the most sacred spot in South America, vast numbers of\npilgrims came here from all points. The city itself had entirely\ndisappeared, covered deeply in sand, but for a long distance round, it\nhad, like the neighbourhood of Jerusalem and Mecca, been a vast\ncemetery, and a small amount of excavation showed the tombs of the\nfaithful, occupied in most cases by mummies.\n\n\"We will ride across to the Incas' temple. There is not much to see\nthere, but it is as well that you should look at the vaults in which\nthe treasures were hid. There are similar places at Cuzco and several\nof the other ruins.\"\n\n\"It may certainly be useful to see them,\" Harry agreed, and they rode\nacross the plain. Leaving their mules outside they entered the ruins.\nThe Indian led them into some underground chambers. He had brought a\ntorch with him, and this he now lit.\n\n\"You have to be careful or you might otherwise tumble into one of these\nholes and break a limb; and in that case, if you were here by\nyourselves, you would certainly never get out again.\"\n\nThey came upon several of these places. The openings were sometimes\nsquare and sometimes circular, and had doubtless been covered with\nsquare stones. They were dug out of the solid ground. For about six\nfeet the sides of the pit were perpendicular; in some it swelled out\nlike a great vase with a broad shoulder, in others it became a square\nchamber of some size.\n\n\"Some of these places were no doubt meant to store grain and other\nprovisions,\" the Indian said, \"some were undoubtedly treasuries.\"\n\n\"Awkward places to find,\" Harry said; \"one might spend a lifetime in\nsearching for them in only one of these temples.\"\n\n\"They were the last places we should think of searching,\" Dias said.\n\"For years the Spaniards kept thousands of men at work. I do not say\nthat there may not be some few places that have escaped the searchers,\nbut what they could not with their host of workers find certainly could\nnot be found by four or five men. It is not in the temples that the\nIncas' wealth has been hidden, but in caves, in deep mountain gorges,\nand possibly in ruins on the other side of the mountains where even the\nSpaniards never penetrated. There are such places. I know of one to\nwhich I will take you if our search fails elsewhere. It is near the\nsea, and yet there are not half a dozen living men who have ever seen\nit, so strangely is it hidden. Tradition says that it was not the work\nof the Incas, but of the people before them. I have never seen it\nclose. It is guarded, they say, by demons, and no native would go\nwithin miles of it. The traditions are that the Incas, when they\nconquered the land, found the place and searched it, after starving out\nthe native chief who had fled there with his followers and family. Some\nsay that they found great treasure there, others that they discovered\nnothing; all agree that a pestilence carried off nearly all those who\nhad captured it. Others went, and they too died, and the place was\nabandoned as accursed, and in time its very existence became forgotten;\nthough some say that members of the tribe have always kept watch there,\nand that those who carelessly or curiously approached it have always\nmet with their death in strange ways. Although I am a Christian, and\nhave been taught to disbelieve the superstitions of my countrymen, I\nwould not enter it on any condition.\"\n\n\"If we happen to be near it I shall certainly take a close look at it,\"\nHarry said with a laugh. \"I don't fancy we should see anything that our\nrifles and pistols would find invulnerable.\"\n\nIt was getting dark by the time they had finished their inspection of\nthe rooms, so, riding two or three miles away, they encamped in a grove\nup the valley. Next morning they returned to Lima. Dias had given out\nthat the two white senors intended to visit all the ruined temples of\nthe Incas, and as other travellers had done the same their intention\nexcited neither surprise nor comment.\n\nOn the following evening after dark Harry and his brother were\nreturning from the house of Senor Pasquez.\n\n\"It is a pleasant house,\" Harry said; \"the girls are pretty and nice,\nthey play and sing well, and are really charming. But what a contrast\nit was the other morning when we went in there and accidentally ran\nagainst them when we were going upstairs with their father, utterly\nuntidy, and, in fact, regular sluts--a maid of all work would look a\npicture of neatness beside them.\"\n\nBertie was about to answer, when there was an outburst of shouts from a\nwine-shop they were passing, and in a moment the door burst open and\nhalf a dozen men engaged in a fierce conflict rushed out. Knives were\nflashing, and it was evident that one man was being attacked by the\nrest. By the light that streamed out of the open door they saw that the\nman attacked was Dias. It flashed across Harry's mind that if this man\nwas killed there was an end to all hope of success in their expedition.\n\n\"Dash in to his rescue, Bertie,\" he cried; \"but whatever you do, mind\ntheir knives.\"\n\nWith a shout he sprang forward and struck to the ground a man who was\ndodging behind Dias with uplifted knife, while Bertie leapt on to the\nback of another, the shock throwing the man down face forward. Bertie\nwas on his feet in a moment, and brought the stick he carried with all\nhis force down on the man's head as he tried to rise. Then, springing\nforward again, he struck another man a heavy blow on the wrist. The\nknife dropped from the man's hand, and as he dashed with a fierce oath\nupon Bertie the stick descended again, this time on his head, and\nfelled him to the ground. In the meantime one of the assailants had\nturned fiercely on Harry and aimed a blow at him with his knife; but\nwith the ease of a practised boxer Harry stepped back, and before the\nman could again raise the knife he leaped in and struck him a\ntremendous blow on the point of his chin. The fifth man took to his\nheels immediately. The other four lay where they had fallen, evidently\nfearing they would be stabbed should they try to get on to their feet.\n\n\"Are you hurt, Dias?\" Harry exclaimed.\n\n\"I have several cuts, senor, but none of them, I think, serious. You\nhave saved my life.\"\n\n\"Never mind that now, Dias. What shall we do with these fellows--hand\nthem over to the watch?\"\n\n\"No, senor, that would be the last thing to do; we might be detained\nhere for months. I will take all their knives and let them go.\"\n\n\"Here are two of them,\" Bertie said, picking up those of the men he had\nstruck.\n\nDias stood over the man Harry had first knocked down, and with a fierce\nwhisper ordered him to give up his knife, which he did at once. The\nother was still stupid from the effect of the blow and his fall, and\nDias had only to take his knife from his relaxed fingers.\n\n\"Now, senor, let us be going before anyone comes along.\"\n\n\"What was it all about, Dias?\" Harry asked as he walked away.\n\n\"Many of the muleteers are jealous, senor, because I always get what\nthey consider the best jobs. I had gone into the wine-shop for a glass\nof pulque before going round to see that the mules were all right. As I\nwas drinking, these men whispered together, and then one came up to me\nand began to abuse me, and directly I answered him the whole of them\ndrew their knives and rushed at me. I was ready too, and wounded two of\nthem as I fought my way to the door. As I opened it one of them stabbed\nme in the shoulder, but it was a slanting blow. Once out they all\nattacked me at once, and in another minute you would have had to look\nfor another muleteer. 'Tis strange, senors, that you should have saved\nmy life as Mr. Barnett did. It was a great deed to risk your lives with\nno weapons but your sticks against five ruffians with their knives.\"\n\n\"I did not use my stick,\" Harry said. \"I am more accustomed to use my\nfists than a stick, and can hit as hard with them, as you saw. But my\nbrother's stick turned out the most useful. He can box too, but cannot\ngive as heavy a blow as I can. Still, it was very lucky that I followed\nyour advice, and bought a couple of heavy sticks to carry with us if we\nshould go out after dark. Now you had better come to the hotel, and I\nwill send for a surgeon to dress your wound.\"\n\n\"It is not necessary, senor; my wife is waiting for me in my room, she\narrived this afternoon. Knife cuts are not uncommon affairs here, and\nshe knows quite enough to be able to bandage them.\"\n\n\"At any rate we shall have to put off our start for a few days.\"\n\n\"Not at all, senor; a bandage tonight and a few strips of plaster in\nthe morning will do the business. I shall be stiff for a few days, but\nthat will not interfere with my riding, and Jose will be able to load\nand unload the mules, if you will give him a little assistance. Adios!\nand a thousand thanks.\"\n\n\"That was a piece of luck, Bertie,\" Harry said when they had reached\ntheir room in the hotel. \"In the first place, because neither of us got\na scratch, and in the second, because it will bind Dias more closely to\nus. Before, he was willing to assist us for Barnett's sake, now it will\nbe for our own also, and we may be quite sure that he will do his best\nfor us.\"\n\n\"It is my first scrimmage,\" Bertie said, \"and I must say that I\nthought, as we ran in, that it was going to be a pretty serious one. We\nhave certainly come very well out of it.\"\n\n\"It was short and sharp,\" Harry laughed. \"I have always held that the\nman who could box well was more than a match for one with a knife who\nknew nothing of boxing. One straight hit from the shoulder is sure to\nknock him out of time.\"\n\nNext morning Dias and his wife came up early. The former had one arm in\na sling. As they entered, the woman ran forward, and, throwing her arms\nround Bertie, she kissed him on both cheeks. The lad was too much\nsurprised at this unexpected salute to return it, as his brother did\nwhen she did the same to him. Then, drawing back, she poured out her\nthanks volubly, the tears running down her cheeks.\n\n\"Maria asked me if she might kiss you,\" Dias said gravely when she\nstopped. \"I said that it was right that she should do so, for do we not\nboth owe you my life?\"\n\n\"You must not make too much of the affair, Dias; four blows were\nstruck, and there was an end to it.\"\n\n\"A small matter to you, senor, but a great one to us. A Peruvian would\nnot interfere if he saw four armed men attacking one. He would be more\nlikely to turn down the next street, so that he might not be called as\na witness. It is only your countrymen who would do such things.\"\n\n\"And you still think that you will be ready to start the day after\nto-morrow?\"\n\n\"Quite sure, senor. My shoulder will be stiff and my arm in a sling for\na week, but muleteers think nothing of such trifles,--a kick from a\nmule would be a much more serious affair.\"\n\n\"You don't think those rascals are likely to waylay us on the road, and\ntake their revenge?\"\n\n\"Not they, senor. If you could do such things unarmed, what could you\nnot do when you had rifles and pistols? The matter is settled. They\nhave not been seriously hurt. If one of them had been killed I should\nbe obliged to be careful the next time I came here; as it is, no more\nwill be said about it. Except the two hurt in the wine-shop they will\nnot even have a scar to remind them of it. In two years they will have\nother things to think about, if it is true that Colombia means to go to\nwar with Chili.\"\n\n\"What is the quarrel about, Dias?\"\n\n\"The Colombians helped us to get rid of the Spaniards, but ever since\nthey have presumed a right to manage affairs here.\"\n\n\"Perhaps nothing will come of it.\"\n\n\"Well, it is quite certain that there is no very good feeling between\nChili, Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru.\"\n\n\"I suppose they will be fighting all round some day?\"\n\n\"Yes, and it will interfere with my business. Certainly we are better\noff than when the Spaniards were here; but the taxes are heavy, and\nthings don't go as people expected they would when we got rid of the\nSpaniards. All the governments seem jealous of each other. I don't take\nany interest in these matters except so far as they interfere with\ntrade. If every man would attend to his own affairs it would be better\nfor us all.\"\n\n\"I suppose so, Dias; but one can hardly expect a country that has been\nso many years governed by a foreign power to get accustomed all at once\nto governing itself.\"\n\n\"Now, senor, I shall be glad if you will go with me and look at the\nstores that are already collected. I think you will find that\neverything is ready.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nAMONG THE MOUNTAIN\n\n\nTwo days later the mules were brought round to the door at sunrise, and\nHarry and his brother sallied out from the hotel, dressed for the first\ntime in the Peruvian costume. They were both warmly clothed. On their\nheads were felt hats with broad brims, which could be pulled down and\ntied over the ears, both for warmth and to prevent their being blown\naway by the fierce winds that sweep down the gorges. A thick poncho of\nllama wool fell from their shoulders to their knees, and loosely tied\nround their necks were thick and brightly- scarves. They wore\nhigh boots, and carried large knives stuck in a strap below the knee.\nThe rifles were fastened at the bow of their saddles, and their\nwallets, with provisions for the day, were strapped behind. By the\nadvice of Dias each had in his pocket a large pair of green goggles, to\nprotect their eyes from the glare of sun and snow. They tied these on\nbefore coming downstairs, and both agreed that had they met\nunexpectedly in the street they would have passed each other without\nthe slightest recognition.\n\n\"It is a pity, Harry,\" Bertie said seriously, \"that you did not have\nyour portrait taken to send home to a certain young lady. You see, she\nwould then have been able to hang it up in her room and worship it\nprivately, without anyone having the slightest idea that it was her\nabsent lover.\"\n\n\"You young scamp,\" Harry said, \"I will pull your ears for you.\"\n\n\"If you attempt anything of the sort, I shall tie the brim of my hat\ntightly over them. I really think it is very ungrateful of you not to\ntake my advice in the spirit in which I gave it.\"\n\n\"If you intend to go on like this, Bert, I shall leave you behind.\"\n\n\"You can't do it.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I can! I might give you in charge for some crime or other;\nand in lack of evidence, the expenditure of a few dollars would, I have\nno doubt, be sufficient to induce the judge, magistrate, or whatever\nthey call him, to give you six months' imprisonment.\"\n\n\"Then you are an unnatural brother, and I will make no more suggestions\nfor your good.\"\n\nSo they had come downstairs laughing, though feeling a little shy at\ntheir appearance as they issued out of the courtyard. Speedily,\nhowever, they gained courage as they saw that passers-by paid no\nattention to them.\n\nThey had spent the previous afternoon in packing the bundles, in which\nevery item was put away so that it could be got at readily, and in\nmaking sure that nothing had been omitted. The five baggage mules were\nfastened one behind another, and Jose stood at the head of the leading\none. As they came out Dias swung his wife on to a cushion strapped\nbehind his saddle, and mounted himself before her. Harry and his\nbrother climbed into theirs. They had both refused to put on the heavy\nand cruel spurs worn by the Peruvians, but had, at the earnest request\nof the Indian, put them in their saddle-bags.\n\n\"You will want them,\" he said. \"You need not use them cruelly, but you\nmust give your mules an occasional prick to let them know that you have\nspurs.\"\n\nOn leaving the town the road ran up the valley of the Rimac, a small\nriver, but of vital importance to the country through which it passes,\nas small canals branching from it irrigate the land.\n\n\"The Spaniards have done some good here at least,\" Harry said to Dias,\nwho was riding beside him.\n\n\"Some of these canals were constructed in their time, but the rest\nexisted long before they came here, and, indeed, long before the Incas\ncame. The Incas' work lies chiefly beyond the mountains; on this side\nalmost all the great ruins are of cities and fortresses built by the\nold people. Cuzco was the Incas' capital, and almost all the towns\nbetween the two ranges of the Andes were their work. It is true that\nthey conquered the people down to the sea, but they do not seem to have\ncared to live here. The treasures of Pachacamac and the other places on\nthe plains were those of the old people and the old religion. The\ninhabitants of the plains are for the most part descendants of those\npeople. The Incas were strong and powerful, but they were not numerous.\nThat was why the Spaniards conquered them so easily. The old people,\nwho regarded them as their masters, did not care to fight for them,\njust as the Peruvians did not care to fight for the Spaniards.\"\n\n\"I expect it was a good deal like the Normans in England,\" Bertie put\nin. \"They conquered the Saxons because they were better armed and\nbetter disciplined, but they were few in number in comparison with the\nnumber they governed, and in their quarrels with each other the bulk of\nthe people stood aloof; and it was only when the Normans began their\nwars in France and Scotland, and were obliged to enlist Saxon archers\nand soldiers, that the two began to unite and to become one people.\"\n\n\"I have no doubt that was so, Bertie; but you are breaking our\nagreement that you should speak in Spanish only.\"\n\n\"Oh, bother! you know very well that I cannot talk in it yet, and you\nsurely do not expect that I am going to ride along without opening my\nlips.\"\n\n\"I know you too well to expect that,\" Harry laughed, \"and will allow an\noccasional outbreak. Still, do try to talk Spanish, however bad it may\nbe. You have got cheek enough in other things, and cheek goes a long\nway in learning to talk a foreign language. You have been four months\nat your Spanish books, and should certainly begin to put simple\nsentences together.\"\n\n\"But that is just what one does not learn from books,\" the lad said.\n\"At any rate, not from such books as I have been working at. I could do\na high-flown sentence, and offer to kiss your hand and to declare that\nall I have is at your disposal. But if I wanted to say, 'When are we\ngoing to halt for dinner? I am feeling very peckish,' I should be\nstumped altogether.\"\n\n\"Well, you must get as near as you can, Bertie. I dare say you cannot\nturn slang into Spanish; but you can find other words to express your\nmeaning, and when you cannot hit on a word you must use an English one.\nYour best plan is to move along on the other side of Dias, and chat to\nhis wife.\"\n\n\"What have I got to say to her?\"\n\n\"Anything you like. You can begin by asking her if she has ever gone a\nlong journey with her husband before, how far we shall go\nto-day--things of that sort.\"\n\n\"Well, I will try anyhow. I suppose I must. But you go on talking to\nDias, else I shall think that you are both laughing at me.\"\n\nFive miles from Lima they passed through the little village of Quiraz.\nBeyond this they came upon many cotton plantations, and in the ravines\nby the side of the valley or among the ruins of Indian towns were\nseveral large fortresses. They also passed the remains of an old\nSpanish town and several haciendas, where many cattle and horses were\ngrazing. They were ascending steadily, and after passing Santa Clara,\neleven miles from Lima, the valley narrowed and became little more than\na ravine. On either side were rents made in the hills by earthquakes,\nand immense boulders and stones were scattered about at the bottom of\nthe narrow gorge. Four hours' travelling brought them to Chosica, where\nthe valley widened again near the foot of the hills.\n\nHere they halted for the day. There was an inn here which Dias assured\nthem was clean and comfortable, and they therefore took a couple of\nrooms for the night in preference to unpacking their tents.\n\n\"It is just as well not to begin that till we get farther away,\" Harry\nsaid. \"We have met any number of laden mules coming down, and if we\nwere to camp here we should cause general curiosity.\"\n\nHe accordingly ordered dinner for himself and his brother, Dias\npreferring to take his meal in a large room used by passing muleteers.\nThe fare was as good as they had had at the hotel at Lima.\n\n\"I am not sorry that we halted here,\" Bertie said; \"I feel as stiff as\na poker.\"\n\n\"I think you got on very well, Bertie, with Mrs. Dias. I did not hear\nwhat you were saying, but you seemed to be doing stunningly.\"\n\n\"She did most of the talking. I asked her to speak slowly, as I did not\nmanage to catch the sense of what she said. She seems full of fun, and\na jolly little woman altogether. She generally understood what I meant,\nand though she could not help laughing sometimes, she did it so\ngood-temperedly that one did not feel put out. Each time I spoke she\ncorrected me, told me what I ought to have said, and made me say it\nafter her. I think I shall get on fairly well at the end of a few\nweeks.\"\n\n\"I am sure you will, Bertie; the trouble is only at the beginning, and\nnow that you have once broken the ice, you will progress like a house\non fire.\"\n\nThere were still four hours of daylight after they had finished their\nmeal, so they went out with Dias to explore one of the numerous\nburying-grounds round the village. It consisted of sunken chambers. In\nthese were bones, with remains of the mats in which the bodies had been\nclothed. These wrappings resembled small sacks, and they remarked that\nthe people must have been of very small size, or they could never have\nbeen packed away in them. With them had been buried many of the\nimplements of their trade. One or two had apparently not been opened.\nHere were knitting utensils, toilet articles, implements for weaving,\nspools of thread, needles of bone and bronze. With the body of a girl\nhad been placed a kind of work-box, containing the articles that she\nhad used, and the mummy of a parrot, some beads, and fragments of an\nornament of silver. Dias told them that all these tombs were made long\nbefore the coming of the Incas. He said that round the heads of the men\nand boys were wound the slings they had used in life, while a piece of\ncotton flock was wrapped round the heads of the women. Many of the\ngraves communicated with each other by very narrow passages; the\npurpose of these was not clear, but probably they were made to enable\nthe spirits of the dead to meet and hold communion with each other.\n\n\"I don't want to see any more of them,\" Bertie said after they had\nspent three hours in their investigations; \"this sort of thing is\nenough to give one a fit of the blues.\"\n\nBeyond Chosica civilization almost ceased. The road became little more\nthan a mule track, and was in many places almost impassable by vehicles\nof any kind. Nothing could be wilder than the scenery they passed. At\ntimes rivers ran through perpendicular gorges, and the track wound up\nand down steep ravines. Sometimes they would all dismount, though Dias\nassured them it was not necessary; still, it made a change from the\nmonotonous pace of little over two miles an hour at which the mules\nbreasted the steep incline.\n\nJose rode on the first of the baggage mules, which was very lightly\nloaded; he generally sang the whole time. When on foot, Donna Maria\nstepped gaily along and Bertie had hard work to keep pace with her. He\nwas making rapid progress with the language, though occasionally a peal\nof laughter from his companion told of some egregious error.\n\nThere were villages every few miles, but now when they halted they did\nso as a rule a mile before they got to one of these. Dinner was cooked\nover a fire of dead sticks, and after the meal Harry's tent was erected\nand the bed spread in it. The Indians went on to the village for the\nnight, while Harry and his brother sat and smoked for a time by the\nfire and then turned in. At daybreak Dias rode back leading their\nriding mules and a baggage animal; the tent, beds, and the cooking\nutensils were packed up, and they rode in to the village and passed on\nat a trot until they overtook Maria and Jose, who had started with the\nother four mules when Dias rode away. At last they reached the head of\nthe pass, and two days' journey took them to Oroya, standing on an\nelevated plateau some ten thousand feet above the sea, and five\nthousand below the highest point of the road.\n\nThe scenery had now completely changed. Villages were scattered thickly\nover the plain, cultivation was general. The hillsides were lined by\nartificial terraces, on which were perched chalets and small\nhamlets--they had seen similar terraces on the way up. These were as\nthe Spaniards found them, and must at one time have been inhabited by a\nthriving population. Even now gardens and orchards flourished upon them\nup to the highest points on the hills. Oroya was a large place, and,\navoiding the busy part of the town, they hired rooms, as it was\nnecessary to give the mules two days' rest. On the first evening after\ntheir arrival they gathered round a fire, for the nights were cold, and\neven in the daytime they did not find their numerous wraps too hot for\nthem.\n\n\"Now, Dias,\" Harry said, \"we must talk over our plans. You said that we\nwould not decide upon anything till we got here.\"\n\n\"In the first place, senor, I think it would be well to go to the north\nto see the Cerro de Pasco silver mine, they say it is the richest in\nthe world. It is well that you should see the formation of the rocks\nand the nature of the ore; we may in our journeyings come across\nsimilar rock.\"\n\n\"It is gold rather than silver that one wants to find, Dias. I do not\nsay that a silver mine would not be worth a very large sum of money,\nbut it would be necessary to open it and go to a large expense to prove\nit. Then one would have to go to England and get up a company to work\nit, which would be a long and difficult matter. Still, I am quite ready\nto go and see the place.\"\n\nDias nodded.\n\n\"What you say is true, senor. I could take you to a dozen places where\nthere is silver. They may be good or may not, but even if they were as\nrich as Potosi the silver would have to be carried to Lima, so great a\ndistance on mules' backs that it would swallow up the profits. And it\nwould be almost impossible to convey the necessary machinery there,\nindeed to do so would involve the making of roads for a great distance.\"\n\n\"At the same time, Dias, should you know of any silver lodes that might\nturn out well, I would certainly take some samples, and send two or\nthree mule-loads of the stuff home. They might be of no good for the\npurpose for which I have come out here, but in time I might do\nsomething with them; the law here is that anyone who finds a mine can\nobtain a concession for it.\"\n\n\"That is so, senor, but he must proceed to work it.\"\n\n\"I suppose it would be sufficient to put two or three men on for that\npurpose.\"\n\n\"But if you were away for a year difficulties might arise. It would be\nbetter for you only to determine the course of the lode, its thickness\nand value, to trace it as far as possible, and then hide all signs of\nthe work, and not to make your claim until you return here.\"\n\n\"Very well, I will take your advice, Dias. And now about the real\nobject of our journey.\"\n\n\"I have been thinking it over deeply,\" Dias said. \"First as to mines;\nat present almost all the gold that is obtained is acquired by washing\nthe sands of rivers. Here and there gold has been found in rocks, but\nnot in sufficient quantities to make mining pay. The rivers whose sands\nare richest in gold are in the mountains that lie behind Lake Titicaca,\nwhich lies to the south of Cuzco and on the border of Bolivia. No one\ndoubts that in the time of the Incas there existed gold mines, and very\nrich ones; for if it had not been so it is impossible to account for\nthe enormous amount of gold obtained by the Spanish conquerors, and no\none doubts that they got but a small portion of the gold in existence\nwhen they arrived. It is of no use whatever for us to search the old\nruins of the Incas in Cuzco, or their other great towns; all that can\nbe found there has already been carried away.\n\n\"Now you see, senor, Huanuco, Jauja, Cuzco, and Puno all lie near the\neastern range of the Andes, and when the alarm caused by the arrogant\nconduct of the Spaniards began, it was natural that the treasures\nshould be sent away into the heart of those mountains. The towns on the\nwestern sides of this plateau, Challhuanca, Tanibobamba, Huancavelica,\nwould as naturally send theirs for safety into the gorges of the\nwestern Andes, but all traditions point to the fact that this was not\ndone by the Incas. As soon as the Spaniards arrived and struck the\nfirst blow, the great chiefs would naturally call together a band of\ntheir followers on whose fidelity they could rely, load the treasures\non llamas, of which they possessed great numbers, and hurry them off to\nthe mountains.\n\n\"It is among the mountains, therefore, that our search must be made.\nAll our traditions point to the fact that it was along the eastern\nrange of the Cordilleras, and the country beyond, that by far the\ngreater portion of the treasures were taken for concealment. At any\nrate, as we have but eighteen months for the search it is on that side\nthat we must try, and ten times that length of time would be\ninsufficient for us to do it thoroughly. As to the gold mines, it is\ncertain that they lie in that portion of the range between Cuzco and\nLake Titicaca. It was near Puno, a short distance from the lake, that\nthe Spaniards, owing to the folly of an Indian, found great treasures\nin a cave. They would probably have found much more had not a stream\nsuddenly burst out which flooded the whole valley and converted it into\na lake. Which do you think we had better look for first, gold mines or\nhidden treasures?\"\n\n\"Of course that must depend on you, Dias, and how much you know about\nthese matters. I need not say that a hidden treasure would be of vastly\nmore use to me than the richest gold mine in the world. To obtain the\ngold from a mine an abundance of labour is required, besides machinery\nfor crushing quartz and separating the gold from it. In the bed of a\nriver, if it is rich and abounding in nuggets, three or four men, with\nrough machinery, could wash out a large quantity of gold in a short\ntime, and a place of that sort would be far better than a rich mine,\nwhich could not be worked without a large amount of capital.\"\n\n\"I have heard tales of such places on the other side of the mountains\nto the south. From time to time gold-seekers have returned with as much\nas they could carry, but not one in a hundred of those that go ever\ncome back; some doubtless die from hunger and hardship, but more are\nkilled by the Indians. Most of the tribes there are extremely savage,\nand are constantly at war with each other, and they slay every white\nman who ventures into their country.\"\n\n\"Then is it not probable, Dias, that the gold could have come from\ntheir country?\"\n\n\"Not from the plains, but from the streams running down into them; and\nalthough the Incas never attempted to subdue the tribes beyond the\nmountains, they may have had bodies of troops to protect the workers\nfrom incursions by these savages.\"\n\n\"Are there many wild beasts there?\"\n\n\"In some parts of the mountains pumas and jaguars abound.\"\n\n\"That is not altogether satisfactory, though I should not mind if we\nfell in with one occasionally. But how about game, Dias?\"\n\n\"The chief game are the wild vicunas, which are very numerous in some\nparts; but they are very shy and difficult to hunt. Deer are plentiful,\nand there are foxes, bears, and hogs; but the great article of food is\nfish. On the plains the manatee, which is very like the seal, is\ncaught; turtles are found in great numbers, and the people make oil\nfrom their eggs; and the buffo, a sort of porpoise, also abounds. The\nnatives do not eat these, except when very pressed for food; they catch\nthem for the sake of their oil. There are many kinds of fish: the\nsunaro, which I heard an English traveller say are like the fish the\nEnglish call the pike; these grow to the length of seven or eight feet.\nAnd many smaller kinds of fish are caught by throwing the juice of the\nroot of the barbasto into small streams. This makes the fish stupid,\nand they float on the surface so that they may easily be caught by\nhand. There are also many sorts of fruit.\"\n\n\"Well, then, we ought to do fairly well, Dias.\"\n\n\"Yes, senor; but many of these creatures are only found in the forests\nand in the rivers of the plains, and they are so much hunted by the\nsavages there that they are very shy. But there are some creatures with\nwhich we certainly do not wish to meet, and unfortunately these are not\nuncommon. I mean the alligators and the great serpents. The natives\nfear the alligators much, for their weapons are of no avail against\nthem, and they would never venture to attack a great snake.\"\n\n\"And besides these, what other disagreeables are there, Dias?\" Bertie\nasked cheerfully.\n\n\"There is one other disagreeable,\" Dias replied, \"and it is a serious\none. There are in the mountains many desperate men. Some have slain an\nenemy who had friends influential enough to set the law in motion\nagainst them, or have escaped from prison; some have resisted the\ntax-collectors; many have been suspected of plotting against the\ngovernment; and others are too lazy to work.\"\n\n\"And how do they live?\" Harry asked.\n\n\"They live partly on game and partly on plunder. They steal from\ncultivators; they are paid a small sum by all muleteers passing through\nthe mountains; they rob travellers who are worth robbing; and sometimes\nthey carry off a proprietor of land, and get a ransom for him.\nOccasionally they will wash the sand, and get gold enough to send one\nof their number into a town to buy articles they require.\"\n\n\"And do they go in large bands?\"\n\n\"No, senor; as a rule some ten or twelve keep together under the one\nthey have chosen as their chief. Sometimes, if people make complaints\nand troops are sent against them, they will join to resist them; but\nthis is not often. The authorities know well enough that they have no\nchance of catching these men among the mountains they are so well\nacquainted with, and content themselves with stationing a few troops in\nthe villages.\"\n\n\"And is it through the robbers or the savages that so few of the gold\nexplorers ever return?\"\n\n\"It is chiefly, I think, from hardship,\" Dias said; \"but undoubtedly\nmany who venture down near the Indians' country are killed by them.\nSome who have done well, and are returning with the gold they have\naccumulated, fall victims to these robbers. You must not, of course,\nsuppose that there are great numbers of them, senor. There may be some\nhundreds, but from Huancabamba--the northern frontier of the western\nCordilleras, where the Maranon crosses the eastern range--down to Lake\nTiticaca on the one side, and Tacna on the other, is nigh a thousand\nmiles, and the two ranges cover more square leagues than can be\nreckoned, and even a thousand men scattered over these would be but so\nmany grains of sand on a stretch of the sea-shore.\"\n\n\"It certainly sounds like it, Dias; but perhaps those worthy people\ncongregate chiefly in the neighbourhood of the passes.\"\n\n\"That is so, senor; but even through these a traveller might pass many\ntimes without being troubled by them.\"\n\n\"Have you fallen in with them often, Dias?\"\n\n\"Yes; but, as you see, they have done me no harm. Sometimes, when I get\nto the end of my journey, the mules are not so heavily laden as when I\nstarted; but generally the people for whom I work say to me, 'Here are\nso many dollars, Dias; they are for toll.' There are places in the\nvillages at the foot of the most-frequented passes where it is\nunderstood that a payment of so many dollars per mule will enable you\nto pass without molestation. In return for your money, you receive a\nribbon, or a rosette, or a feather, and this you place in your hat as a\npassport. You may meet a few men with guns as you pass along, but when\nthey see the sign they salute you civilly, ask for a drink of wine if\nyou are carrying it, then wish you good-day. It is only in\nlittle-frequented passes that you have to take your chance. I may say\nthat though these men may plunder, they never kill a muleteer. They\nknow that if they did, all traffic on that road would cease, and the\nsoldiers would find guides who knew every path and hiding-place in the\nmountains.\"\n\n\"Anyhow, I think it is well, Dias, that I took your advice, and handed\nover my gold to Senor Pasquez, for if we do fall into the hands of any\nof these gentry, we can lose practically nothing.\"\n\n\"No money, senor, but we might lose everything else, except perhaps the\nmules, which they could not use in the mountains. But if they were to\ntake our blankets, and tents, and provisions, and your firearms, we\nshould be in a bad way if we happened to be a couple of hundred miles\nin the heart of the mountains.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't think they will take them,\" Harry said grimly, \"without\npaying pretty dearly for them. With your gun and our rifles, and that\nold fowling-piece which you got for Jose, which will throw a fairly\nheavy charge of buck-shot, I think we can make a very good fight\nagainst any band of eight men, or even one or two more.\"\n\n\"I think so,\" Dias said gravely. \"It is seldom I miss my mark. Still, I\nhope we shall not be troubled with them, or with the Indians. You see,\nit is not so much an attack by day that we have to fear, as a surprise\nat night. Of course, when we are once on the hills, Jose and I will\nkeep watch by turns. He is as sharp as a needle. I should have no fear\nof any of these robbers creeping up to us without his hearing them. But\nI can't say so much for him in the case of the Indians, who can move so\nnoiselessly that even a vicuna would not hear them until they were\nwithin a spear's-throw.\"\n\n\"The spear is their weapon then, Dias?\"\n\n\"Some tribes carry bows and arrows, others only spears, and sometimes\nthey poison the points of both these weapons.\"\n\n\"That is unpleasant. Are there remedies for the poisons?\"\n\n\"None that I know of, nor do I think the savages themselves know of\nany. The only chance is to pour ammonia at once into the hole that is\nmade by an arrow, and to cut out all the flesh round a spear-wound, and\nthen to pour in ammonia or sear it with a hot iron.\"\n\n\"That accounts for your buying that large bottle of ammonia at Lima. I\nwondered what you wanted it for. When we get into the country these\nunpleasant people inhabit, I will fill my spirit-flask with it, so that\nit will always be handy if required. Now we understand things\ngenerally, Dias. It only remains for you to decide where we had best\nleave the plain and take to the mountains.\"\n\nDias was silent for a minute. \"I should say, senor, that first we had\nbetter journey down to Cuzco and then down to Sicuani, where the\nwestern Cordilleras, after making a bend, join the eastern branch, and\nthere cross the Tinta volcano. On the other side are many gorges. In\none of these I know there is some very rich gold sand. Explorers have\nsought for this spot in vain, but the secret has been well kept by the\nfew who know it. It has been handed down in my father's family from\nfather to son ever since the Spaniards came. He told it to me, and I\nswore to reveal it to none but my son. I have no son, and the secret\ntherefore will die with me. Whether it has been passed down in any\nother family I cannot say. It may be, or it may not be; but as I owe\nyou my life, and also the debt of gratitude to Senor Barnett, I feel\nthat you are more to me than a son. Moreover, the secret was to be kept\nlest it should come to the knowledge of the Spaniards. The Spaniards\nhave gone, and with them the reason for concealment, so I feel now that\nI am justified in taking you there.\"\n\n\"I am glad of that, Dias. Assuredly the gold can be of service to no\nman as long as it lies there, and it would be better to utilize it than\nallow it to waste. I need not say how grateful I shall feel if you can\nput me in the way of obtaining it.\"\n\n\"That I cannot absolutely promise,\" he said. \"I have the indications,\nbut they will be difficult to find. Three hundred years bring great\nchanges--rocks on which there are marks may be carried away by\ntorrents, figures cut in the cliffs may be overgrown by mosses or\ncreepers. However, if but a few remain, I hope to be able to find my\nway. If I fail we must try elsewhere; but this is the only one of which\nI have been told all the marks. I know generally several places where\ngreat treasure was hidden, but not the marks by which they could be\ndiscovered, and as we may be sure that every measure was taken to hide\nthe entrances to the caves, the chances would be all against our\nlighting upon them. I may say, senor, that, great as was the treasure\nof the Incas, that of the Chimoos or Chincas, a powerful people who\ninhabited part of this country, was fully as large; and traditions say\nthat most of the treasures hidden were not those of the Incas, but of\nthe Chimoos, who buried them when their country was invaded by the\nIncas.\n\n\"This is certainly the case with most of the treasures hidden to the\nwest of the mountains. It was so at Pachacamac; it was so at Truxillo,\nwhere the Spaniards found three million and a half dollars of gold; and\nit is known that this was but a small hoard, and that the great one,\nmany times larger, has never been discovered. Probably the secret has\nlong been lost; for if there are but few who know where the Incas\nburied their gold, it may well be believed that the exact locality of\nthe Chimoo treasures, which were buried more than eight hundred years\nago, is now unknown, and that nothing but vague traditions have been\nhanded down.\"\n\n\"That one can quite understand,\" Harry agreed, \"when we consider how\nmany of the Chimoos must have fallen in the struggle with the Incas,\nand how more than half the population were swept away by the Spaniards,\nto say nothing of those who have died in the wars of the last thirty\nyears. It seems strange, however, that the treasures in the temple of\nPachacamac were left untouched by the Incas and allowed to accumulate\nafterwards.\"\n\n\"It was so generally regarded as the sacred city,\" Dias said, \"that,\npowerful as they were, the Incas did not attempt to interfere with it,\nas to do so would certainly have stirred up a formidable insurrection\nof the natives throughout the whole of their territory; and instead,\ntherefore, of taking possession of the temple and dedicating it to\ntheir own god, they allowed it to remain untouched and the worship of\nthe old gods to be carried on there, contenting themselves with\nbuilding a temple of their own to the Sun-god close at hand.\"\n\n\"Whether any treasure we find belonged to the Incas or to the Chimoos\nis of no consequence whatever. I certainly think that before entering\nupon what would seem to be almost a hopeless search for such stores, we\nshould try this place that you know of. In that case it seems to me,\nDias, that if we had gone down the coast to Islay, and up through\nArequipa to Cuzco, our journey would have been considerably shorter.\"\n\n\"That is true, senor, but we should have found it difficult to take a\npassage for our mules; the steamers are but small craft, with poor\naccommodation even for passengers. And besides, until we had made all\nour arrangements for the journey from Lima, I could hardly say that I\nhad made up my mind to bring you to this place. Only when you and your\nbrother saved my life did I feel that I was bound to aid you, even to\nthe point of divulging the secret. It is different now from what it was\nwhen it was first handed down. At that time the Spaniards were\nmercilessly slaying all known to be in the possession of any secret\nconnected with gold, and every discovery of gold entailed the forced\nlabour of thousands more of the natives. Well, senor, all that is\nchanged; we are our own masters, and those who find mines are allowed\nto work them on payment of certain royalties. There is, therefore, no\ngood in keeping a secret that has been useless for hundreds of years.\"\n\n\"Certainly, Dias, you will have the satisfaction of knowing that you\nare injuring no one by the act, and are besides doing a very good\naction to my brother and myself.\n\n\"Well, Bertie,\" Harry said when Dias had left the room, \"I think we may\ncongratulate ourselves. For the first time I really think there is a\nchance of the expedition turning out a success.\"\n\n\"It certainly looks like it,\" Bertie agreed. \"For your sake I hope it\nwill be so. As for me, I am quite content; what with Indians and\nbrigands, wild beasts, alligators, and snakes, the journey is likely to\nbe an exciting one.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nA TROPICAL FOREST\n\n\nIt took them over three weeks to reach Cuzco. They did not hurry, for\nthey wished to keep the mules in good condition for the serious work\nbefore them. They were travelling across a plateau thickly dotted with\nvillages and small towns, and everywhere richly cultivated. Near the\nsummit of the mountains large flocks of alpacas were grazing, and lower\ndown herds of cattle and sheep, while near the plain were patches of\nwheat, barley, and potatoes, which in turn were succeeded by fields of\nmaize, apple and peach trees, and prickly-pears. At the foot were\nfields of sugar-cane, oranges, citron, pine-apples, cacao, and many\nother tropical fruits; while in the deeper ravines cotton was grown in\nabundance for the wants of the population. Here, in fact, were all\nvarieties of climate, from the perpetual snow on the summits of the\nlofty mountains to a tropical heat in the valleys.\n\n\"If the Incas had been contented with this glorious plateau, which for\ncenturies constituted their kingdom, and had passed a law against the\ngathering of gold and the mining for silver, they might still have been\nlords here,\" Harry said one day. \"There would have been nothing to\ntempt the avarice of the Spaniards, for owing to the distance of the\nmines from the coast, the cost of carriage would have been immense, and\nthe long sea journey would have rendered the exportation of the natural\nproducts of the country impossible. Some of the more sober-minded of\nthe Dons might have settled down here and taken wives from among the\ndaughters of the nobles, and, bringing with them the civilization of\nSpain, become valuable colonists. The Incas, before they extended their\nconquest over the whole of the west of South America, must have been a\ncomparatively simple people, and would have had none of the habits of\nluxury and magnificence that tempted the Spaniards. The gold of South\nAmerica was the ruin of the Incas, as it was afterwards the chief cause\nof the ruin of Spain.\"\n\n\"Well, Harry, then I should very strongly advise you to give up\ntreasure-hunting and to remain poor, for the curse of the gold may not\nhave worked itself out yet.\"\n\n\"I must risk that, Bertie. I have no desire for luxury or magnificence;\nit is for a laudable purpose that I seek the gold. However, if you have\nany scruples on the subject there is no occasion for you to have any\nshare in what I may discover.\"\n\n\"No, I think I will agree with you and risk it; though certainly at\npresent I don't see what advantage any amount of money would be to me.\"\n\nThe houses of the peasants were for the most part comfortable, although\nsmall, for since the expulsion of the Spaniards, the people had had no\nreason to make a pretence of poverty. During the Spanish rule no one\ndared, by the size of his house or by his mode of living, to show signs\nof wealth above his fellows, for to do so would be to expose himself to\nthe cruel exactions of the tax-collectors and local officials; and even\nnow they had hardly recognized the change that had taken place, and\nremained wedded to the habits that had become rooted in them by\ncenturies of oppression.\n\nThe travellers had no difficulty whatever in purchasing food and forage\non the way. They always slept in their tents now, and preferred Donna\nMaria's cooking to that which they could obtain in the small and\ngenerally dirty inns in the towns.\n\nBy the time they reached Cuzco, Bertie was able to converse in Spanish\nwith some fluency. On the way he rode either beside Dias and his wife,\nor with Jose; in either case an animated conversation was kept up,\nsometimes on the stirring events of the war of independence and the\nsubsequent struggles, sometimes about life in England, its ways and\ncustoms, concerning which neither Maria nor Jose had any knowledge\nwhatever. Bertie also endeavoured to gain some information concerning\nthe history of Peru prior to the rising against Spain; but neither the\nwoman nor boy knew anything of the subject beyond the fact that the\nIncas were great people, and that the natives still mourned for them.\n\n\"You see that black apron most of the women wear over one hip, as a\nsign of mourning; it is still worn for the Incas. They must have been\ngood people, and not cruel like the Spanish, or they would not be so\nmuch regretted,\" Maria said. \"I don't wear the apron, because both Dias\nand I are of mixed blood, descendants on one side of natives, and on\nthe other of Creoles, that is of Spaniards whose families were settled\nhere, and who hated their countrymen just as much as we do. Well, there\nis Cuzco in sight. I have never seen it, and am glad that we shall stay\nthere for a few days.\"\n\nThe old capital of the Incas lay at the end of a valley about two miles\nin length, and about a mile in width. To the north of the city rose an\nabrupt hill, crowned by the great citadel with its three lines of\nwalls, the hill being divided from those forming the side of the valley\nby two deep ravines, in which flowed little streams that ran through\nthe city. The appearance of the town was striking. There were numerous\nchurches, its streets ran at right angles to each other, and the\nmassive stone houses dated from the early Spanish days, though they\nwere surmounted for the most part by modern brickwork additions. Where\nthe great Temple of the Sun once stood, the church of Santo Domingo had\nbeen built, a portion of the splendid building of the old faith being\nincorporated in it.\n\n\"What is the use of staying here?\" Bertie asked his brother\nimpatiently, two days after they had arrived at Cuzco. \"I dare say\nthese old ruins and fortresses, and so on, are very interesting to\npeople who understand all about the Incas; but as I know nothing about\nthem, I don't see how you can expect me to get up any interest in an\nold wall because you tell me that it is one of the remains of a palace\nbelonging to some old chap I never heard of. I shall be very glad when\nDias says that the mules have had enough rest and that we can set out\non our business.\"\n\n\"I am afraid you are a Goth, Bert,\" Harry said, looking at him with an\nexpression of pity. \"Here you are in one of the most interesting cities\nof the world, a place that thousands and thousands of people would\ntravel any distance to investigate, and in forty-eight hours you are\ntired of it. You have no romance in your nature, no respect for the\npast; you are a Goth and a Philistine.\"\n\n\"I am afraid you are mixing up localities, Harry. I may be a Goth or a\nPhilistine, but perhaps you are not aware that these peoples or tribes\nhad no connection with each other. Your education in matters\nunconnected with the Royal Navy seems to have been even more deplorably\nneglected than my own.\"\n\n\"Shut up, youngster!\"\n\n\"No, Lieutenant Prendergast, you are not on the quarter-deck of one of\nHer Majesty's ships at present. You are not even the leader of a small\ncaravan on the march. We are in this locanda on terms of perfect\nequality, save and except in any small advantage that you may possess\nin the matter of years.\"\n\nHarry laughed.\n\n\"Well, Bertie, I do not altogether disagree with what you say. If I had\ncome here to get up the history of the Incas, and investigate the ruins\nof their palaces, I should be content to stay here for some weeks; but\nas it is, I am really just as anxious as you are to be on the move. I\nwas speaking to Dias half an hour ago, and he says that in two more\ndays we shall be able to start again. We have been discussing how much\nflour and other things it is absolutely necessary to take. Of course\nthe better provided we are the more comfortable we shall be; but on the\nother hand, as Dias says, it is of great importance that the mules\nshould carry as little weight as possible.\n\n\"In crossing the passes we shall have the benefit of the old roads of\nthe Incas, but once we leave these the difficulties will be enormous.\nDias said that it might be better to dispose of our mules altogether\nand get trained llamas in their place, as these can climb over rocks\nwhere no mule could obtain a foothold. But then it would be necessary\nto take with us one or two natives accustomed to their ways, and this\nwould not suit us at all. However, I do think that it would be worth\nwhile to take two or three of these animals with us. They can carry a\nhundred pounds apiece; but as we may be going over extraordinarily\nrough country, fifty pounds would be sufficient. The advantage would be\nthat we could establish a sort of central camp at the farthest spot to\nwhich the mules could go, and then make exploring expeditions with the\nllamas to carry provisions and tools. The llamas are not bad eating, so\nthat if we found no other use for them they would assist our\ncommissariat.\"\n\n\"How far can they go in a day, Harry?\"\n\n\"Ten or twelve miles, and you may be sure that that is as much as we\ncan do when we are among the mountains.\"\n\n\"Then I should think they would be very useful. I suppose there will be\nno difficulty in buying them?\"\n\n\"None at all. A good many are brought in for sale to the market every\nday. Of course it would be necessary to get strong animals accustomed\nto burdens.\"\n\nBefore starting there was another long consultation between Harry and\nDias as to which course it would be better to adopt. The\nmost-frequented pass through the mountains was that to Paucartambo,\nforty miles north-east from Cuzco, at the mouth of the pass that leads\ndown into the plains. Between this town and the Carabaya range, a\nhundred and fifty miles to the south, was to be found the rich gold\ndeposit to which Dias had referred. So far, however, as the traditions\nhe had received informed him, it was situated near the <DW72>s of the\nTinta volcano, and between that and Ayapata. The direct road to this\nspot was extremely difficult, and he was of opinion that the journey\ncould be more easily performed by going to Paucartambo and then\nskirting the foot of the mountains.\n\n\"You will find no difficulty in obtaining food as you go along,\" he\nsaid; \"wild turkeys, pheasants, and other birds are to be met with in\nthat district. Moreover, there are many plantations which have been\ndeserted owing to the depredations of the Chincas, a tribe who live on\nthe tributaries of the Pueros, or as it used to be called, Rio Madre de\nDios. Here you will find fields of maize still growing, sugar-cane,\ncacao, and rice. One after another the estates have been abandoned; at\nsome of them the whole of the people on the farms were massacred, and\nin all the danger was so great that the proprietors found it impossible\nto work them. The one drawback to that road is that we may fall in with\nthe Chincas, in which case they will certainly attack us. However, they\nare widely scattered through the forests, and we may not fall in with\nthem. On the other hand, the track by the Tinta mountain from Sicuani\nis extremely difficult and dangerous, We might lose several of our\nanimals in traversing it, and should have to depend entirely on what we\ncarried for food.\"\n\n\"Then by all means let us go the other way, Dias. Were we to lose some\nof our mules it would be impossible to replace them, and it would be\nuseless to find gold if we could not carry it away.\"\n\nTwo days later they started, four llamas having been added to the\ncaravan. Dias explained that it would not be necessary to take any\nnatives to attend to these animals, as, once started, they would follow\nthe mules without difficulty, especially if they were fed with them\nbefore starting. Three days' travelling brought them to the little\ntown, which lay very high up in the hills. The cold here was bitter,\nand the party needed all their wraps, and were glad to get in motion as\nsoon as it was light. Passing over a range of mountains above\nPaucartambo, where a thin layer of snow crunched under their feet, they\nbegan the tremendous descent into the plain. In a short time the\nmorning mist cleared away. The road led through a tropical forest. It\ntook them over three hours to reach the river Chirimayu, a descent of\neleven thousand feet in the course of eight miles.\n\nHere they halted by the side of a splendid waterfall. The hills rose up\nperpendicularly on every side except where the little river made its\nway through the gorge; they were covered with brushwood, ferns, and\ncreepers, thick with flowers of many colours, while lofty palms and\nforest trees grew wherever their roots could find a hold. Splendid\nbutterflies of immense size flitted about; birds of many kinds and\nbeautiful plumage flew hither and thither among the trees;\nhumming-birds sucked the honey from the bright flowers; parrots\nchattered and screamed in the upper branches of the trees, and the foam\nand spray of the torrent sparkled in the sun. Harry and his brother\nstood struck with admiration at the loveliness of the scene, even Donna\nMaria and Jose ceased their chatter as they looked at a scene such as\nthey had never before witnessed.\n\n\"It is worth coming all the way from England to see this, Bertie.\"\n\n\"It is, indeed. If it is all like this I sha'n't mind how long Dias\ntakes to find the place he is in search of.\"\n\nAt a word from Dias they all set to work to take the burdens off the\nanimals. A place was cleared for the tents. When these had been erected\nJose collected dried sticks. A fire was soon lighted, and Maria began\nto prepare breakfast.\n\n\"Is it unhealthy here, Dias?\"\n\n\"Not here, senors; we are still many hundred feet above the plain. In\nthe forest there it is unhealthy for whites, the trees grow so thickly\nthat it is difficult to penetrate them, swamps and morasses lie in many\nplaces, and the air is thick and heavy. We shall not go down there\nuntil we need. When we must descend we shall find an abundance of\nmaize, and fruits of all sorts. The savages kill the people they find\non the estates, but do not destroy the crops or devastate the fields.\nThey are wise enough to know that these are useful to them, and though\nthey are too lazy to work themselves they appreciate the good things\nthat others have planted.\"\n\n\"It is rather early to make a halt, Dias.\"\n\n\"We have work to do, senor. In the first place we must find a spot\nwhere large trees stand on the bank of the torrent. Two or three of\nthese must be felled so that they fall across it; then we shall have to\nchop off the branches, lay them flat side by side, and make a bridge\nover which to take animals. After breakfast we must set about this\nwork, and it will be too late before we finish to think of going\nfarther to-day.\"\n\n\"It is well that we bought four good axes and plenty of rope at Cuzco,\"\nHarry said.\n\n\"We shall want them very often, senor. Three large torrents come down\nbetween this and the Tinta volcano, besides many smaller ones. Some\nrise from the hills to the north of us. These fall into others, which\neventually combine to make the Madre de Dios. So far as is known boats\ncan descend the river to the Amazon without meeting with any obstacle,\nfrom a point only a few miles from the head of the Pueros, which we\nshall presently cross. The fact that there are no cataracts during the\nwhole course from the hills to the junction of the rivers, shows how\nperfectly flat the great plain is.\"\n\n\"And did either the Incas or the Spaniards ever conquer the Chincas and\ncultivate these splendid plains?\"\n\n\"The Incas drove them back some distance, senor, and forced them to pay\na tribute, but they never conquered them. Doubtless they cultivated the\nland for some leagues from the foot of the mountains, as did the\nSpaniards, and it was considered the most fertile part of the Montana,\nas their possessions this side of the Cordilleras were called. The\nSpaniards tried to push farther, but met with such stout opposition by\nthe savages that they were forced to desist.\"\n\nAll were ready when Maria announced breakfast. After the meal they sat\nsmoking for half an hour, reluctant to commence the heavy work before\nthem.\n\n\"We had better be moving, senor,\" Dias said as he rose to his feet, \"or\nwe shall not get the bridge made before dark.\"\n\nA hundred yards from the camp they found three large trees growing\nclose to each other near the edge of the stream. Bertie looked at them\nwith an air of disgust.\n\n\"This will be worse for the hands than rowing for twelve hours in a\nheavy boat.\"\n\n\"I dare say it will,\" Harry agreed; \"but it has got to be done, and the\nsooner we set about it the better.\"\n\n\"I shall take off my flannel shirt,\" Bertie said.\n\n\"You had better not, senor,\" Dias said, as he saw what the lad was\nabout to do. \"There are many insects here that will sting you, and the\nbites of some of them swell up and turn into sores. Now, senor, I will\ntake this tree. The next is not quite so large, will you take that? I\nwill help you when I am finished with my own. Your brother and Jose can\nwork by turns at the other.\"\n\nIt was hard work, for the trees were over two feet across near the\nfoot. Dias had felled his before the others had cut half-way through,\nand he then lent his aid to Harry, who was streaming with perspiration.\n\n\"You are not accustomed to it, senor. You will manage better when you\nhave had two or three months' practice at the work.\"\n\n\"I did not bargain for this, Harry,\" Bertie said as he rested for the\ntwentieth time from his work. \"Jaguars and alligators, Indians and\nbandits, and hard climbing I was prepared for, but I certainly never\nexpected that we should have to turn ourselves into wood-cutters.\"\n\n\"It is hard work, Bertie, but it is useless to grumble, and, as Dias\nsays, we shall become accustomed to it in two or three months.\"\n\n\"Two or three months!\" Bertie repeated with a groan; \"my hands are\nregularly blistered already, and my arms and back ache dreadfully.\"\n\n\"Well, fire away! Why, Jose has done twice as much as you have, and he\nhas hardly turned a hair. I don't suppose that he has had much more\npractice than you have had, and he is nothing like so strong.\"\n\n\"Oh, I dare say! if he has never cut, his ancestors have, and I suppose\nit is hereditary. Anyhow, I have been doing my best. Well, here goes!\"\n\nHarry laughed at his brother's theory for explaining why Jose had done\nmore work than he had. He was himself by no means sorry that Dias had\ncome to his assistance, and that his tree was nearly ready to fall.\nJose climbed it with the end of a long rope, which he secured to an\nupper bough. Dias then took the other end of the rope, crossed the\ntorrent by the tree he had felled, and when Jose had come down and\nHarry had given a few more cuts with the axe, he was able to guide the\ntree in its fall almost directly across the stream. Then he took\nBertie's tree in hand. In ten minutes this was lying beside the others.\nIt took three hours' more work to cut off the branches and to lay the\ntrees side by side, which was done with the aid of one of the mules.\nThe smaller logs were packed in between them to make a level road, and\nwhen this was done the workers went back to the little camp. The sun\nwas already setting, and Donna Maria had the cooking-pots simmering\nover the fire.\n\n\"That has been a hard day's work,\" Harry said, when he and his brother\nthrew themselves down on the grass near the fire.\n\n\"Hard is no name for it, Harry. I have never been sentenced to work on\na tread-mill, but I would cheerfully chance it for a month rather than\ndo another day's work like this. The palms of my hands feel as if they\nhad been handling a red-hot iron, my arms and shoulders ache as if I\nhad been on a rack. I seem to be in pain from the tips of my toes to\nthe top of my head.\"\n\nHarry laughed.\n\n\"It is only what every settler who builds himself a hut in the\nbackwoods must feel, Bert. It is the work of every wood-cutter and\ncharcoal-burner; it is a good deal like the work of every miner. You\nhave been brought up too soft, my boy.\"\n\n\"Soft be hanged!\" the lad said indignantly; \"it is the first time I\nhave heard that the life of an apprentice on board a ship was a soft\none. I have no doubt you feel just as bad as I do.\"\n\n\"But you don't hear me grumbling, Bert; that is all the difference. I\nexpect that, of the two, I am rather the worse, for my bones and\nmuscles are more set than yours, and it is some years now since I\npulled at either a rope or an oar.\"\n\nBertie was silent for a minute or two, and then said rather\napologetically:\n\n\"Well, Harry, perhaps I need not have grumbled so much, but you see it\nis a pretty rough beginning when one is not accustomed to it. We ought\nto have had a short job to begin with, and got into it gradually,\ninstead of having six hours on end; and I expect that the backwoods\nsettler you were talking about does not work for very long when he\nfirst begins. If he did he would be a fool, for he certainly would not\nbe fit for work for a week if he kept on till he had nearly broken his\nback and taken the whole skin off his hands by working all day the\nfirst time he tried it.\"\n\n\"There is something in that, Bertie; and as we are in no extraordinary\nhurry I do think we might have been satisfied with felling the trees\nto-day, and cutting off the branches and getting them into place\nto-morrow. Still, as Dias seemed to make nothing of it, I did not like\nto knock off at the very start.\"\n\n\"The meal is ready, senor,\" Maria said, \"and I think we had better eat\nit at once, for the sky looks as if we were going to have rain.\"\n\n\"And thunder too,\" Dias said. \"You had better begin; Jose and I will\npicket the mules and hobble the llamas. If they were to make off, we\nshould have a lot of trouble in the morning.\"\n\nThe aspect of the sky had indeed changed. Masses of cloud hung on the\ntops of the hills, and scud was flying overhead.\n\nMaria placed one of the cooking-pots and two tin plates, knives, and\nforks beside Harry and his brother, with two flat cakes of ground maize.\n\n\"Sit down and have your food at once,\" Harry said to her. \"The rain\nwill be down in bucketfuls before many minutes.\"\n\nThey were soon joined by Dias and Jose, the latter bringing up a large\ncan of water from the stream. They had just finished when large drops\nof rain began to patter on the ground.\n\n\"Never mind the things,\" Harry said as he leapt to his feet. \"Crawl\nunder shelter at once; it is no use getting a wetting.\"\n\nAll at once made for the tents; and they were but just in time, for the\nrain began to fall in torrents, and a peal of thunder crashed out\noverhead as they got under the canvas.\n\n\"This is our first experience of this sort of thing,\" Harry said, as he\nand his brother lit their pipes half-sitting and half-reclining on\ntheir beds. \"I rather wondered why Dias put the tents on this little\nbit of rising ground, which did not look so soft or tempting as the\nlevel; but I see now that he acted very wisely, for we should have been\nflooded in no time if we had been lower down. As it is, I am by no\nmeans sure that we shan't have the water in. Another time we will take\nthe precaution to make trenches round the tents when we pitch them.\nHowever, we have got a waterproof sheet underneath the beds, so I\nexpect it will be all right.\"\n\n\"I hope so. Anyhow, we had better see that the edges are turned up all\nround, so that the water cannot run over them. By Jove! it does come\ndown. We can hardly hear each other speak.\"\n\nSuddenly the entrance to the tent was thrust aside.\n\n\"Here is a candle, senors.\"\n\nIt was thrown in, and Dias ran back into his own tent, which was but a\nfew yards away, before Harry could remonstrate at his coming out.\n\n\"The candle will be useful, anyhow,\" Bertie said. \"It is almost\npitch-dark now. What with the sun going down and the clouds overhead,\nit has turned from day into night in the past five minutes.\"\n\nStriking a match he lit the candle, and stuck it in between his shoes,\nwhich he took off for the purpose.\n\n\"That is more cheerful, Harry.\"\n\n\"Hullo! what is that?\"\n\nA deep sound, which was certainly not thunder, rose from the woods. It\nwas answered again and again from different directions.\n\n\"They must be either pumas or jaguars, which are always called here\nlions and tigers, and I have no doubt Dias will know by the roar which\nit is. I should not mind if it were daylight, for it is not pleasant to\nknow that there are at least half a dozen of these beasts in the\nneighbourhood. We may as well drop the cartridges into our rifles and\npistols. I believe neither of these beasts often attacks men, but they\nmight certainly attack our mules.\"\n\nThe storm continued, and each clap of thunder was succeeded by roars,\nsnarls, and hissing, and with strange cries and shrieks. During a\nmomentary lull Harry shouted:\n\n\"Is there any fear of these beasts attacking us or the mules, Dias?\"\n\n\"No, senor, they are too frightened by the thunder and lightning to\nthink of doing so.\"\n\n\"What are all those cries we hear?\"\n\n\"Those are monkeys, senor. They are frightened both by the storm and by\nthe roaring of the lions and tigers.\"\n\n\"Which is the bigger, Harry, the puma or the jaguar?\"\n\n\"I believe the jaguar is the bigger, but the puma is the more\nformidable and fiercer. The latter belongs to the same family as the\nlion, and the former to that of the leopards. The jaguar is more\nheavily built than the leopard, and stronger, with shorter legs, but it\nis spotted just as the leopard is. The puma is in build like the lion,\nbut has no mane. Both prey on animals of all kinds. The natives say\nthey catch turtles, turn them over on their backs as a man would do,\nand tear the shells apart. They will also eat fish; but they are both\nscourges to the Indians and white planters, as they will kill sheep,\nhorses, and cattle. Of course, if they are attacked by men and wounded,\nthey will fight desperately, as most wild creatures will; but if man\ndoes not molest them, they are quite content to leave him alone, unless\nhe chances to pass under a tree among the branches of which they are\nlying in wait for prey. Both of them can climb trees.\"\n\n\"Well, I thought I should have slept like a log, Harry, after the work\nthat I have done, but what with the thunder and the patter of the rain,\nand all those noises of beasts, I don't think I am likely to close my\neyes.\"\n\n\"We shall get accustomed to the noises after a time, Bert; but at\npresent I feel as if I were in the middle of a travelling menagerie\nwhich had been caught in a thunderstorm. It is curious that all animals\nshould be frightened at lightning, for they cannot know that it is\nreally dangerous.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know. We had two dogs on the last ship I was in. A clap of\nthunder would send them flying down the companion into the cabin, and\nthey would crouch in some dark corner in a state of absolute terror.\nThey would do just the same if cannon were fired in salute, or anything\nof that sort. I suppose they thought that was thunder.\"\n\nIn spite, however, of the noises, Harry and his brother both dropped\noff to sleep before long, being thoroughly worn out by the day's work.\nThey were awakened by Dias opening the front of their little tent.\n\n\"The sun is up, senors, and it is a fine morning after the storm. Maria\nhas got coffee ready, baked some cakes, and fried some slices of meat.\"\n\n\"All right, Dias! we will be out directly. We will first run up the\nbank a short distance, and have a dip.\"\n\n\"You won't be able to swim, senor. The bed of the torrent is full, and\nno swimmer could breast the water.\"\n\n\"All right! we will be careful.\"\n\nThrowing on their ponchos, they went down to the stream and ran along\nthe bank.\n\n\"The water is coming down like a race-horse, Bert, but just ahead it\nhas overflowed its banks. We can have a bath there safely, though it is\nnot deep enough for swimming.\"\n\nAfter ten minutes' absence they returned to the camp, completed their\ndressing, and sat down to breakfast.\n\n\"What were all those frightful noises, Dias? Were they pumas or\njaguars?\"\n\n\"They were both, senor. You can easily tell the difference in the\nsounds they make. The jaguar's is between a roar and a snarl, while the\npuma's is a sort of a hissing roar.\"\n\nAs soon as breakfast was over, the tents were packed up and the mules\nand llamas laden. Dias had given them a feed all round an hour before.\nThe course they should take had been already agreed upon; they must\ndescend to the plain, for it would be next to impossible to cross the\nravines on the mountain-side.\n\n\"Each stream coming down from the hills,\" Dias said, \"must be followed\nnearly up to its source, but for the next seventy or eighty miles the\nsearch need not be so careful as it must be afterwards. The place\ncannot be far from Tinta, but somewhere this side of it. We need not\nhurry, for there are two months to spare.\"\n\n\"How do you mean, Dias?\"\n\n\"On a day that answers to the 21st of March, Coyllur--that is a\nstar--will rise at midnight in a cleft in a peak. It can be seen only\nin the valley in which the stream that contains the gold runs down.\nThis is what my father taught me; therefore there must be mountains to\nthe south-east, and this can only be where the Cordilleras run east,\nwhich is the case at Tinta.\"\n\n\"That is excellent as far as it goes, if we happen to be in the right\nvalley at the time, Dias, but it would not help us in the slightest if\nwe were in any other valley. And we should have to wait a year before\ntrying in another place.\"\n\n\"Yes, senor, but there are marks on the rocks of a particular kind.\nThere are marks on rocks in other valleys, so that these should not be\ndistinguished by Spaniards searching for the place. I should know the\nmarks when I saw them.\"\n\n\"Then in that case, Dias, the star would not be of much use to us.\"\n\n\"I know not how that might be, senor, but as these instructions have\nbeen handed down from the time when the Spaniards arrived, it must\nsurely in some way be useful, but in what way I cannot say.\"\n\n\"At any rate, Dias, what with those marks you speak of, and the star,\nit will be hard if we cannot find it. I suppose you are sure that the\nplace is rich if we do light upon it?\"\n\n\"Of that there can be no doubt, senor. Tradition says that it was the\nrichest spot in the mountains, and was only worked when the king had\nneed of gold, either for equipping an army or on some special occasion.\nAt such a time it would be worked for one month, and then closed until\ngold was again required. However, as we go that way we shall explore\nother valleys. Gold is found more or less in all of them. Possibly we\nmay find some rich spot which we can fall back upon if we fail in our\nsearch.\"\n\n\"But I hardly see how we can fail, with the star and those marks on the\nrocks to aid us.\"\n\n\"The marks may have disappeared, senor, and in that case we may not be\nin the right spot when the star rises; or again, the Incas may have\nclosed the approach in some way to make the matter sure. I cannot\npromise that we shall find the gold; but I shall do my best with the\nknowledge that has come down to me. If I fail, we must try in other\ndirections. When the Spaniards came, forty thousand of the Incas'\npeople left Cuzco and the neighbouring towns, and journeyed away down\nthe mountains and out to the west. Since then no reliable news\nconcerning them has been heard, but rumours have from time to time come\nfrom that direction to the effect that there is a great and wealthy\ncity there. I say not that if we failed here we should attempt to find\nit. The dangers from the savages would be too great. There would be\ngreat forests to traverse, many rivers to be crossed. We might travel\nfor years without ever finding their city. When we got there, we might\nbe seized and put to death, and if we were spared we might not be able\nto make off with the treasure. I mention it to show that gold may be\nfound in many other places besides this valley we are seeking.\"\n\n\"I quite agree with you, Dias, that unless we could get some indication\nof the position of this city, if it now exists, it would be madness to\nattempt to search for it. I want gold badly, but I do not propose that\nwe should all throw away our lives in what would be almost a hopeless\nadventure. Even if I were ready to risk my own life on such a mad\nenterprise, I would not ask others to do the same.\"\n\nCrossing the stream, they made their way down through the forest. It\nwas toilsome work, as they often had to clear a way with axes through\nthe undergrowth and tangle of creepers. But at noon they reached level\nground. The heat was now intense, even under the trees, and the air\nclose and oppressive. On the way down Harry shot a wild turkey. When\nthey halted, this was cut up and broiled over a fire, and after it had\nbeen eaten all lay down and slept for two or three hours.\n\n\"Ought we not to set a guard?\" Harry had asked.\n\n\"No, senor, I do not think it necessary. Jose will lie down by the side\nof the llamas, and even if the mules should not give us a warning of\nany man or beast approaching, the llamas will do so. They are the\nshyest and most timid of creatures, and would detect the slightest\nmovement.\"\n\nFor the next three weeks they continued their way. During this time\nfive or six ravines were investigated as far as they could be ascended.\nSamples were frequently taken from sand and gravel and washed, but\nthough particles of gold were frequently found, they were not in\nsufficient quantity to promise good results from washing.\n\n\"If we had a band of natives with us,\" Dias said, \"we should no doubt\nget enough to pay well--that is to say, to cover all expenses and leave\nan ounce or two of profit to every eight or ten men engaged--but as\nmatters stand we should only be wasting time by remaining here.\"\n\nThey had no difficulty in obtaining sufficient food; turkeys and\npheasants were occasionally shot; a tapir was once killed, and, as they\nhad brought hooks and lines with them, fish were frequently caught in\nthe streams. These were of small size, but very good eating. But, as\nDias said, they could not hope to find larger species, except far out\nin the plains, where the rivers were deep and sluggish.\n\nThe work was hard, but they were now accustomed to it. They often had\nto go a considerable distance before they could find trees available\nfor bridging the torrents, but, on the other hand, they sometimes came\nupon some of much smaller girth than those they had first tackled. The\nlabour in getting these down was comparatively slight. Sometimes these\nstood a little way from the stream, but after they were felled two\nmules could easily drag them to the site of the bridge. When on the\nmarch, Harry and his brother carried their double-barrelled guns, each\nwith one barrel charged with shot suitable for pheasants or other\nbirds, the other with buck-shot. Dias carried a rifle. Very seldom did\nthey mount their mules, the ground being so rough and broken, and the\nboughs of the trees so thick, that it was less trouble to walk at the\nheads of their animals than to ride.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nAN INDIAN ATTACK\n\n\nOne day when they returned from exploring a valley, Harry and his\nbrother, taking their rifles, strolled down an open glade, while Dias\nand Jose unpacked the animals. They had gone but a hundred yards when\nthey heard a sound that was new to them. It sounded like the grunting\nof a number of pigs. Dias was attending to the mules. Harry and Bertie\ncaught up their guns. Presently a small pig made its appearance from\namong some trees. Harry was on the point of raising his gun to his\nshoulder when Dias shouted, \"Stop, do not shoot!\"\n\n\"What is the matter, Dias?\" he asked in surprise, as the latter ran up.\n\n\"That is a peccary.\"\n\n\"Well, it is a sort of pig, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes, senor. But if you were to kill it, we might all be torn in\npieces. They travel through the forests in great herds, and if one is\ninjured or wounded, the rest will rush upon its assailants. You may\nshoot down dozens of them, but that only redoubles their fury. The only\nhope of escape is to climb a tree; but they will keep watch there,\nregardless of how many are shot, until hunger obliges them to retire.\nThey are the bravest beasts of the forests, and will attack and kill\neven a lion or a tiger if it has seized one of their number. I beg you\nto stroll back quietly, and then sit down. I will go to the head of the\nmules. If the herd see that we pay no attention to them, they may go on\nwithout interfering with us. If we see them approaching us, and\nevidently intending to attack, we must take to the trees and try to\nkeep them from attacking the mules; but there would be small chance of\nour succeeding in doing so.\"\n\nHe and Jose at once went up to the mules, and stood perfectly quiet at\ntheir head. Harry and Bertie moved closely up, laid their\ndouble-barrelled guns beside them, and then sat down. By this time\nforty or fifty of the peccaries had issued from the trees; some were\nrooting among the herbage, others stood perfectly quiet, staring at the\ngroup on the rise above them. Seeing no movement among them nor any\nsign of hostility, they joined the others in their search for food, and\nin a quarter of an hour the whole herd had moved off along the edge of\nthe forest.\n\n\"Praise be to the saints!\" Dias said, taking off his hat and crossing\nhimself. \"We have escaped a great danger. A hunter would rather meet a\ncouple of lions or tigers than a herd of peccaries. These little\nanimals are always ready to give battle, and once they begin, fight\ntill they die. The more that are killed the more furious do the others\nbecome. Even in a tree there is no safety. Many a hunter has been\nbesieged in a tree until, overpowered by thirst, he fell to the ground\nand was torn to pieces.\"\n\n\"What do they eat?\" Harry asked.\n\n\"They will eat anything they kill, but their chief food is roots. They\nkill great numbers of snakes. Even the largest python is no match for a\nherd of peccaries if they catch him before he can take refuge in a\ntree.\"\n\n\"Well, then, it is very lucky that you stopped us before we fired.\"\n\n\"Fortunate indeed, senor. By taking to the trees we might have saved\nour lives, but we should certainly have lost our mules. Both pumas and\ntigers kill the little beasts when they come across stragglers. And it\nis well that they do, for otherwise the woods would be full of them,\nthough fortunately they do not multiply as fast as our pigs, having\nonly two or three in a litter. They are good eating, but it is seldom\nthat a hunter can shoot one, for if he only wounds it, its shrieks will\ncall together all its companions within a mile round.\"\n\n\"Then we must give up the idea of having pork while we are among the\nmountains.\"\n\n\"Now, are you going to keep me here all day, Dias?\" Maria called\nsuddenly. \"It seems to me that you have forgotten me altogether.\"\n\nHarry and Bertie could not help laughing.\n\nDias had, on returning to the mules, taken his wife and seated her on a\nbranch six feet from the ground, in order that, should the peccaries\nattack them, he might be ready at once to snatch up his rifle and join\nin the fight without having first to think of the safety of his wife.\nHe now lifted her down.\n\nThe action did even more than what Dias had said to convince Harry of\nthe seriousness of the danger to which they had been exposed, for as a\nrule Donna Maria had scoffed at any offers of aid, even in the most\ndifficult places, and with her light springy step had taxed the power\nof the others to keep up with her. These offers had not come from Dias,\nwho showed his confidence in his wife's powers by paying no attention\nwhatever, and a grim smile had often played on his lips when Harry or\nhis brother had offered her a hand. That his first thought had been of\nher now showed that he considered the crisis a serious one.\n\n\"I thought Dias had gone mad,\" she said, as she regained her feet. \"I\ncould not think what was the matter when he began to shout and ran\ntowards you. I saw nothing but a little pig. Then, when he came slowly\nback with you and suddenly seized me and jerked me up on to that bough,\nI felt quite sure of it, especially when he told me to hold my tongue\nand not say a word. Was it that little pig? I saw lots more of them\nafterwards.\"\n\n\"Yes; and if they had taken it into their heads to come this way you\nwould have seen a good deal more of them than would be pleasant,\" Dias\nsaid. \"With our rifles we could have faced four lions or tigers with a\nbetter hope of success than those little pigs you saw. They were\npeccaries, a sort of wild pig, and the most savage little beasts in the\nforest. They would have chased us all up into the trees and killed all\nthe mules.\"\n\n\"Who would have thought it!\" she said. \"Why, when I was a girl I have\noften gone in among a herd of little pigs quite as big as those things,\nand never felt the least afraid of them. I must have been braver than I\nthought I was.\"\n\n\"You are a good deal sillier than you think you are, Maria,\" Dias said\nshortly. \"There is as much difference between our pig and a peccary as\nthere is between a quiet Indian cultivator on the Sierra and one of\nthose savage Indians of the woods.\"\n\n\"I suppose I can light a fire now, Dias. There is no fear of those\ncreatures coming back again, is there?\"\n\n\"No, I should think not. Fortunately they are going in the opposite\ndirection, otherwise I should have said that we had better stop here\nfor a day or two in case they should attack us if we came upon them\nagain.\"\n\nThe next day, as they were journeying through the forest, at the foot\nof the <DW72>s Jose gave a sudden exclamation.\n\n\"What is it?\" Dias asked.\n\n\"I saw a naked Indian standing in front of that tree; he has gone now.\"\n\n\"Are you sure, Jose?\"\n\n\"Quite sure. He was standing perfectly still, looking at us, but when I\ncalled to you he must have slipped round the tree. I only took my eyes\noff him for a moment; when I looked again he was gone.\"\n\n\"Then we are in for trouble,\" Dias said gravely. \"Of course it was one\nof the Chincas. No doubt he was alone, but you may be sure that he has\nmade off to tell his companions he has seen us. He will know exactly\nhow many we are, and how many animals we have. It may be twenty-four\nhours, it may be three or four days, before he makes his appearance\nagain; but it is certain that, sooner or later, we shall hear of him.\nHunters as they are, they can follow a track where I should see\nnothing; and so crafty are they, that they can traverse the country\nwithout leaving the slightest sign of their passage. The forest might\nbe full of them, and yet the keenest white hunter would see no\nfootprint or other mark that would indicate their presence.\"\n\n\"What had we better do, Dias?\"\n\n\"We shall probably come to another stream before nightfall, senor. This\nwe will follow up until we get to some ravine bare of trees. There we\ncan fight them; in the forest we should have no chance. They would lie\nin ambush for us, climb into the trees and hide among the foliage, and\nthe first we should know of their presence would be a shower of arrows;\nand as they are excellent marksmen, we should probably be all riddled\nat the first volley. There can be no sauntering now, we must push the\nanimals forward at their best speed. I will lead the way. Do you,\nsenor, bring up the rear and urge the mules forward. I shall try and\npick the ground where the trees are thinnest, and the mules can then go\nat a trot. They cannot do so here, for they would always be knocking\ntheir loads off.\"\n\nIt was evening before they arrived at a stream. Here they made a short\nhalt while they gave a double handful of grain to each of the animals,\nthen they pushed on again until it was too dark to go farther.\n\n\"Will it be safe to light a fire, Dias?\"\n\n\"Yes, that will make no difference. They are not likely to attack us at\nnight. Savages seldom travel after dark, partly because they are afraid\nof demons, partly because they would be liable to be pounced upon by\nwild beasts. But I do not think there is any chance of their overtaking\nus until tomorrow. The man Jose saw may have had companions close at\nhand, but they will know that we are well armed, and will do nothing\nuntil they have gathered a large number and feel sure that they can\noverpower us. They will probably take up the track to-morrow at\ndaylight; but we have made a long march, and can calculate that we\nshall find some defensible position before they overtake us. Jose and I\nwill keep watch to-night.\"\n\n\"We will take turns with you, Dias.\"\n\n\"No, senor; my ears are accustomed to the sounds of the forests, yours\nare not. If you were watching I should still have no sleep.\"\n\nThe night passed without an alarm.\n\nAn hour before daylight Dias gave all the animals a good feed of corn,\nand as soon as it was light they again started. They were already some\ndistance up the mountain, and after eight hours' travelling they\narrived at a gorge that suited their purpose. For two hundred yards the\nrocks rose perpendicularly on each side of the stream, which was but\nsome thirty feet wide. No rain had fallen for some days, and the water\nwas shallow enough at the foot of the cliff for the mules to make their\nway among the fallen rocks, through which it rushed impetuously. At the\nupper end the cliffs widened out into a basin some fifty yards across.\n\n\"We cannot do better than halt here,\" Dias said. \"In two or three hours\nwe can form a strong breast-work on the rocks nearly out to the middle\nof the stream, where the current is too swift for anyone to make his\nway up against it.\"\n\n\"Are they likely to besiege us long, Dias?\"\n\n\"That I cannot say; but I do not think they will give it up easily.\nSavages learn to be patient when roaming the forest in search of game.\nTheir time is of no value to them; besides, they are sure to lose many\nif they attack, and will therefore try to get their revenge.\"\n\n\"They may have to give it up from want of food.\"\n\nDias shook his head.\n\n\"There are sure to be plenty of fish in the river, and they will poison\nsome pool and get an abundance. With their bows and arrows they can\nbring down monkeys from the trees, and can snare small animals.\nHowever, senor, we can talk over these things to-morrow. We had best\nbegin the breast-work at once while Maria is cooking dinner, which we\nneed badly enough, for we have had nothing but the maize cakes we ate\nbefore starting.\"\n\nWorking hard till it was dark, they piled up rocks and stones till they\nformed a breast-work four feet high on both sides. Some twelve feet in\nthe centre were open. They had chosen a spot where so many fallen rocks\nlay in the stream that it needed comparatively little labour to fill up\nthe gaps between them.\n\n\"I thought wood-chopping bad enough,\" Bertie said as they threw\nthemselves down on the ground after completing their labour, \"but it is\na joke to this. My back is fairly broken, my arms feel as if they were\npulled out of the sockets, my hands are cut, I have nearly squeezed two\nnails off.\"\n\n\"It has been hard work,\" Harry agreed; \"still, we have made ourselves\nfairly safe, and we will get the walls a couple of feet higher in the\nmorning. We shall only want to add to them on the lower face in order\nto form a sort of parapet that will shelter us as we lie down to fire,\nso it won't be anything like such hard work. Then we will fill in the\nrocks behind with small stones and sand to lie down upon.\"\n\n\"They will never be able to fight their way up to it,\" Dias said.\n\n\"We need have no fear on that score. The question is, can they get down\ninto this valley behind us; the rocks look very steep and in most\nplaces almost perpendicular.\"\n\n\"They are steep, senor; but trees grow on them in many places, and\nthese savages are like monkeys. We shall have to examine them very\ncarefully when we have finished the wall. If we find that it is\npossible for anyone to get down, we must go up the next gorge and see\nif we can find a better position.\"\n\n\"I suppose you think we are safe for to-night, Dias?'\n\n\"I don't think they will try to come up through the stream. They have\nkeen eyes, but it would be so dark down there that even a cat could not\nsee. They will guess that we have stopped here, and will certainly want\nto find out our position before they attack. One or two may come up as\nscouts, and in that case they may attack at daybreak. Of course two of\nus will keep watch; we can change every three hours. I will take the\nfirst watch with your brother, and you and Jose can take the next.\"\n\n\"Jose had better sleep,\" Maria put in; \"he watched all last night. My\neyes are as good as his, and I will watch with Don Harry.\"\n\nHarry would have protested, but Dias said quietly:\n\n\"That will be well, Maria, but you will have to keep your tongue quiet.\nThese savages have ears like those of wild animals, and if you were to\nraise your voice you might get an arrow in the brain.\"\n\n\"I can be silent when I like, Dias.\"\n\n\"It is possible,\" Dias said dryly; \"but I don't remember in all these\nyears we have been married that I have known you like to do so.\"\n\n\"I take that as a compliment,\" she said quietly, \"for it shows at least\nthat I am never sulky. Well, Don Harry, do you accept me as a fellow\nwatcher?\"\n\n\"Certainly I shall be very glad to have you with me; and I don't think\nthat you need be forbidden to talk in a low tone, for the roar of the\nwater among the rocks would prevent the sound of voices from being\nheard two or three yards away.\"\n\nAccordingly, as soon as it became dark Dias went to the wall with\nBertie. Jose, after a last look at the mules, wrapped himself in a\nblanket and lay down.\n\n\"I think I had better turn in to the tent,\" Harry said; \"we have had\ntwo days' hard work, and the building of that wall has pretty nearly\nfinished me, so if I don't get two or three hours' sleep to-night I am\nafraid I shall not be a very useful sentinel.\"\n\nFive minutes later he was sound asleep, and when his brother roused him\nhe could hardly believe that it was time for him to go on duty.\n\n\"Dias is waiting there. Will you come down?\" the latter said. \"You were\nsleeping like a top; I had to pull at your leg three times before you\nwoke.\"\n\n\"I am coming,\" Harry said as he crawled out. \"I feel more sleepy than\nwhen I lay down, and will just run down to the stream and sluice my\nhead, that will wake me up in earnest, for the water is almost as cold\nas ice.\"\n\nWhen he came back he was joined by Donna Maria, and, taking both his\nshot-gun and rifle, he went forward with her to the barricade.\n\n\"So you have neither seen nor heard anything, Dias?\"\n\n\"Nothing whatever, senor.\"\n\n\"I have had a good sleep, Dias; we will watch for the next four hours.\nIt is eleven o'clock now, so you will be able at three to take it on\ntill daylight.\"\n\n\"I will send and call you again an hour before that,\" Dias said. \"If\nthey attack, as I expect they will as soon as the dawn breaks, we had\nbetter have our whole force ready to meet them.\"\n\nSo saying Dias went off.\n\n\"This is scarcely woman's work, Donna Maria.\"\n\n\"It is woman's work to help defend her life, senor, as long as she can.\nIf I found that the savages were beating us I should stab myself. They\nwould kill you, but they might carry me away with them, which would be\na thousand times worse than death.\"\n\n\"I don't think there is any fear of their beating us,\" Harry said;\n\"certainly not here. We ought properly to be one on each side, but\nreally I shirk the thought of wading through the river waist-deep at\nthat shallow place we found a hundred yards up; it would be bad enough\nto go through it, worse still to lie for four hours in wet clothes.\"\n\n\"Besides, we could not talk then, senor,\" Maria said with a little\nlaugh, \"and that would be very dull.\"\n\n\"Very dull. Even now we must only talk occasionally; we shall have to\nkeep our eyes and ears open.\"\n\n\"I don't think either of them will be much good,\" she said; \"I can see\nthe white water but nothing else, and I am sure I could not hear a\nnaked footstep on the rocks.\"\n\n\"It is a good thing the water is white, because we can make out the\nrocks that rise above the surface. When our eyes get quite accustomed\nto the dark we should certainly be able to see any figures stepping\nupon them or wading in the water.\"\n\n\"I could see that now, senor. I think it will be of advantage to talk,\nfor I am sure if I were to lie with my eyes straining, and thinking of\nnothing else, they would soon begin to close.\"\n\nTalking occasionally in low tones, but keeping up a vigilant watch,\nthey were altogether hidden from the view of anyone coming up the\nstream, for they exposed only their eyes and the top of their heads\nabove the rough parapet. No attempt had been made to fill up the spaces\nbetween the stones, so that, except for the rounded shape, it would be\nnext to impossible to make them out between the rough rocks of the\ncrest. Harry had laid his double-barrelled gun on the parapet in front\nof him. He had loaded both barrels with buck-shot, feeling that in the\ndarkness he was far more likely to do execution with that weapon than\nwith a rifle.\n\nThey had been some two hours on watch when Donna Maria touched his arm\nsignificantly. He gazed earnestly but could see nothing. A minute\nlater, however, a rock about fifteen yards away seemed to change its\nshape. Before, it had been pointed, but just on one side of the top\nthere was now a bulge.\n\n\"Do you see them?\" Maria whispered. \"I can make out one above the\nrocks; the other is standing against the wall.\"\n\n[Illustration: AN INDIAN SPIES THE EXPEDITION.]\n\nThere was no movement for two or three minutes, and Harry had no doubt\nthat they were examining the two black lines of stones between which\nthe water was rushing.\n\n\"There are two others on this side, senor,\" Maria whispered.\n\nThe pause was broken by the sharp tap of two arrows striking on the\nstones a few inches below their heads.\n\n\"Well, you have begun it,\" Harry muttered.\n\nHe had already sighted his gun at the head half-hidden by the rock. He\nnow pulled the trigger, and then, turning, he fired the other barrel,\naiming along the side of the canyon where the two men seen by his\ncompanion must be standing. The head disappeared, and loud cries broke\nfrom the other side. The stillness that had reigned in the valley was\nbroken by a chorus of shrieks and roars, and the air overhead thrilled\nwith the sound of innumerable wings. Harry on firing had laid down the\nfowling-piece and snatched up his rifle.\n\n\"Do you see any others?\"\n\n\"Two have run away; the one against the rocks on the other side was\nwounded, for I saw him throw up his arms, and it was he who screamed.\nThe man by him dropped where he stood; the one behind the rock is\nkilled, I saw his body carried away in the white water.\"\n\nHalf a minute later Dias and Bertie came up.\n\n\"So they have come, senor?\"\n\n\"Yes, there were four of them. Your wife saw them, though I could only\nmake out one. They shot two arrows at us, and I answered them. The man\nI saw was killed, and Donna Maria said that one on the other side also\nfell, and another was wounded.\"\n\n\"That was a good beginning,\" Dias said. \"After such a lesson they will\nattempt nothing more to-night, and I doubt whether they will come down\nin the morning. They can get sight of the barricades from that bend a\nhundred yards down, and I don't think they will dare come up when they\nsee how ready we are for them.\"\n\n\"Well, we will work out our watch anyhow, Dias. Now that I see how\nsharp Donna Maria's eyes are I have not the least fear of being\nsurprised.\"\n\n\"I will stop with you,\" Bertie said; \"I shall have no chance of going\noff to sleep again after being wakened up like that.\"\n\n\"If you are going to stop, Bertie, you had better go back and fetch a\nblanket, it is chilly here; then if you like you can doze off again\ntill your watch comes.\"\n\n\"There is no fear of that, Harry. I have been eight-and-forty hours on\ndeck more than once. I will warrant myself not to go to sleep.\"\n\nIn spite of this, however, in less than ten minutes after his return\nBertie's regular breathing showed that he was sound asleep. Harry and\nMaria continued their watch, but no longer with the same intentness as\nbefore. They were sure that Dias would not have lain down unless he\nfelt perfectly certain that the Chincas would make no fresh move until\nthe morning, and they chatted gaily until, at two o'clock, Dias came up.\n\n\"Everything is quiet here, Dias. My brother is fast asleep, but I will\nwake him now that you have come up.\"\n\n\"Do not do so, senor; he worked very hard building the walls today. If\nI see anything suspicious I will rouse him. We may have work tomorrow,\nand it is much better that he should sleep on.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Dias! the fatigue has told on him more than on us; his\nfigure is not set yet, and he feels it more.\"\n\nHe walked back to the tents with Maria.\n\n\"If you wake just as daylight breaks please rouse me,\" he said.\n\n\"I shall wake, senor; I generally get up at daybreak. That is the best\ntime for work down in the plain, and I generally contrive to get\neverything done before breakfast at seven.\"\n\nHarry slept soundly until he was called.\n\n\"The sky is just beginning to get light, senor.\"\n\nHe turned out at once. Jose was already feeding the mules.\n\n\"You had better come along with me, Jose, and bring that gun of yours\nwith you. If the savages do attack, it will be well to make a forcible\nimpression on them.\"\n\nGreatly pleased with the permission, Jose took up the old musket he\ncarried and accompanied Harry.\n\n\"What have you got in that gun, Jose?\"\n\n\"The charge of buck-shot that you gave me the other day, senor.\"\n\n\"All right! but don't fire unless they get close. The shot will not\ncarry far like a bullet; but if fired when they are close it is better\nthan any bullet, for you might hit half a dozen of them at once.\"\n\nJose had been allowed to practise at their halting-places, and though\nhe could not be called a good shot, he could shoot well enough to do\ngood execution at thirty or forty yards.\n\nBertie was still asleep.\n\n\"Everything quiet, Dias?\"\n\n\"I have seen nothing moving since I came out.\"\n\n\"Now, Bertie,\" Harry said, stirring his brother up with his foot. \"All\nhands on deck!\"\n\nBertie sat up and opened his eyes. \"What is up now?\" he said. \"Ay,\nwhat, is it you, Harry, and Jose too? I must have been asleep!\"\n\n\"Been asleep! Why, you went off in the middle of my watch, and Dias has\nbeen on the look-out for over three hours.\"\n\n\"Oh, confound it! You don't mean to say that I have slept for over five\nhours? Why didn't you wake me, Dias?\" he asked angrily.\n\n\"Two eyes were quite enough to keep watch,\" Dias said. \"I should have\nwaked you if I had seen anything of the savages. Besides, Don Harry\nsaid you might as well go on sleeping if nothing happened, and I\nthought so too.\"\n\n\"I feel beastly ashamed of myself,\" Bertie said. \"I don't want to be\ntreated like a child, Harry.\"\n\n\"No, Bertie, and I should not think of treating you so; but you had had\nvery hard work, and were completely knocked up, which was not\nwonderful; and you may want all your strength to-day. Besides, you\nknow, you would have been of no use had you been awake, for you could\nhave seen nothing. Donna Maria's eyes were a good deal sharper than\nmine, and I am quite sure that, tired as you were, Dias would have seen\nthem coming long before you would. We had better lie down again, for it\nwill be light enough soon for them to make us out. How far do their\narrows fly, Dias?\"\n\n\"They can shoot very straight up to forty or fifty yards, but beyond\nthat their arrows are of very little use.\"\n\n\"Well, then, we shall be able to stop them before they get to that\nravine.\"\n\nPresently, as it became light, a figure showed itself at the turn of\nthe ravine.\n\n\"Don't fire at him,\" Harry said; \"it is better that they should think\nthat our guns won't reach them. Besides, if the beggars will leave us\nalone, I have no wish to harm them.\"\n\nIn a minute or two the figure disappeared behind the bend and two or\nthree others came out. \"They think that our guns won't carry so far, or\nwe should have shot the first man.\"\n\nFor a quarter of an hour there were frequent changes, until at least\nfifty men had taken a look at them.\n\n\"Now there will be a council,\" Harry said as the last disappeared.\n\"They see what they have got before them, and I have no doubt they\ndon't like it.\"\n\n\"I don't think they will try it, senor,\" Dias said. \"At any rate they\nwill not do so until they have tried every other means of getting at\nus.\"\n\nHalf an hour passed, and then Harry said. \"I will stop here with my\nbrother, Dias, and you and Jose had better examine the hillsides and\nascertain whether there is any place where they can come down. You know\na great deal better than I where active naked-footed men could clamber\ndown. They might be able to descend with ease at a place that would\nlook quite impossible to me.\"\n\nWithout a word Dias shouldered his rifle and walked away, followed by\nJose. He returned in two hours.\n\n\"There are several places where I am sure the savages could come down.\nNow, senors, breakfast is ready; I will leave Jose here, and we will go\nand talk matters over while we eat. The tents are only a hundred yards\naway, so that if Jose shouts, we can be back here long before the\nsavages get up, for they could not come fast through that torrent.\"\n\n\"It seems to me,\" Harry said after they had finished the meal, \"that if\nthere are only one or two points by which they could climb down we\ncould prevent their doing so by picking them off; but if there are\nmore, and they really come on in earnest, we could not stop them.\"\n\n\"There are many more than that,\" Dias replied. \"I made out certainly\nfour points on the right-hand side and three on the left where I could\nmake my way down; there are probably twice as many where they could\ndescend.\"\n\n\"Then I should say that the first thing to do is to go up through the\ngorge above and see whether there is any place that could be better\ndefended than this. If we find such a spot, of course we could move to\nit; if not, we shall have to settle whether to go up the gorge till we\nget to some place where the mules can climb out of it, or stay here and\nfight it out. By camping on the stream at a point where it could not be\nforded, and making a breast-work with the bales, stones, and so on, I\nthink we could certainly beat off any attack by daylight, but I admit\nthat we should have no chance if they should make a rush during the\nnight.\"\n\n\"I will go at once,\" said Dias, \"and examine the river higher up. If I\ncan find no place where the mules can climb, I am sure to be able to\nfind some spot where we could do so. But that would mean the failure of\nour expedition, for we certainly could not go up the mountains,\npurchase fresh animals, food, and tools, and get down to the place we\nare looking for until too late.\"\n\n\"That would be serious, Dias, but cannot be counted against our lives.\nIf there is no other way of escape from these savages, we must\ncertainly abandon the animals and make our way back as best we can. In\nthat case we must give up all idea of finding this gold stream. The\nstar would not be in the same place again for another year, and even\nthen we might not find it; so we must make up our minds to do our best\nin some other direction. That point we must consider as settled. I\nshould not feel justified in risking my brother's life, yours, your\nwife's, and your nephew's, by remaining here to fight we know not how\nmany savages--for there may be many more than the fifty we saw this\nmorning, and they may in a day or two be joined by many others of their\ntribe.\"\n\n\"I should not like to lose all the animals and go back empty-handed,\"\nDias said after a silence of two or three minutes, \"unless it were a\nlast resource.\"\n\n\"Nor should I, Dias; but you see, if we linger too long we may find it\nimpossible to retire, we may be so hemmed in that there would be no\nchance of our getting through. For the day of course we are safe. The\nsavages will have to decide among themselves whether to give the matter\nup, seeing that they are sure to lose many lives before they overpower\nus. Then, if they determine to attack us, they will have to settle how\nit is to be done. Numbers of them will go up to the top of the hills on\nboth sides and try to find a point at which they can make their way\ndown; others, perhaps--which would be still more serious--may go\nfarther up into the hills to find a spot where they could come down and\nissue out by the upper gorge, and then our retreat would be altogether\ncut off. All this will take time, so we may feel sure that no attack\nwill be made to-day.\"\n\n\"I will start up the river at once, senor. Certainly the first point to\nbe settled is whether we can find a more defensible spot than this, the\nsecond whether there is any way by which the animals can be taken up.\"\n\n\"There must surely be many points higher up where this can be done.\"\n\n\"Yes, senor, if we could get to them. But you saw we had difficulty in\nmaking our way through this gorge; there may be others higher up where\nit would be impossible either for us or the animals to pass.\"\n\n\"I did not think of that. Yes, that must be so. Well, you had certainly\nbetter go at once. My brother will relieve Jose, and after the boy has\nbreakfasted he can return to his post, and Bertie can join me. I think\nif I see the savages trying to find a path I will open fire upon them.\nI don't say I should be able to hit them, for the top of those hills\nmust be eight or nine hundred yards' range, and it is not easy to hit\nan object very much above or very much below you; but it is important\nthat they should know that our weapons carry as far as that; when they\nhear bullets strike close to them they will hesitate about coming lower\ndown, and unless they do come within two or three hundred feet from the\nbottom they cannot be sure of getting down.\"\n\nDias nodded. \"That is a very good idea. Another cause of delay will be\nthat those at the top cannot see far down the rock on their own side,\nso they will have to start by guess-work. Each party must fix upon the\neasiest places on the opposite side, and then go back again and change\nsides. I don't suppose they know any more of this place than we do.\nThey always keep down in the plains, and it is only because they met us\ndown there that they have followed us so far. I believe they will\nfollow on as long as they think there is a chance of destroying us, for\nthey are so jealous of any white man coming into what they regard as\ntheir country that they would spare no pains to kill anyone who\nventured there. Now I will go, senor. You will keep near this end of\nthe valley, in case there should be an alarm that they are coming up\nthe stream.\"\n\n\"Certainly; and my brother shall remain with Jose. With his rifle and\nthe two double-barrelled guns and Jose's musket they could hold the\nravine against anything but a rush of the whole tribe.\"\n\nAn hour later Harry saw a number of figures appear against the sky-line\non both sides. As they were clustered together, and would afford a far\nbetter mark than a single Indian, he took a steady aim at the party on\nthe southern hill and fired. He had aimed above rather than below them,\nas, had the ball struck much below, they might not hear it, whereas, if\nit went over their heads, they would certainly do so. A couple of\nseconds after firing he saw a sudden movement among the savages, and a\nmoment later not one was to be seen. Donna Maria, who was standing\nclose by him watching them, clapped her hands. \"Your ball must have\ngone close to them,\" she said, \"but I don't think you hit anyone.\"\n\n\"I did not try to do so,\" he said. \"I wanted the ball to go just over\ntheir heads, so that they should know that even at that distance they\nwere not safe. I have no doubt that astonishment as much as fear made\nthem bolt. They'll be very careful how far they come down the side of\nthe hill after that. Now for the fellows on the other side.\"\n\nBut these too had disappeared, having evidently noticed the effect\nproduced upon the others. After a pause heads appeared here and there\nat the edge of the crests. Evidently the lesson had impressed them with\nthe necessity for precaution, as they no longer kept together, and they\nhad apparently crawled up to continue their investigations. Beyond\nkeeping a watch to see that none had attempted to descend the <DW72>\nHarry did not interfere with them. At times he strolled to the\nbreast-work, but no movement had been seen in that direction. In two\nhours Dias returned.\n\n\"The gorge above is a quarter of a mile through, and very difficult to\npass. It is half-blocked with great rocks in two or three places, and\nthere would be immense difficulty in getting the mules over. Beyond\nthat it widens again, but the extent is not more than half what it is\nhere. The walls are almost perpendicular, and I do not think that it\nwould be possible to climb them at any point. Farther up there is\nanother ravine. It is very narrow--not half so wide as this--and the\nstream rushes with great velocity along it. Two hundred yards from the\nentrance the rocks close in completely, and there is a fall of water\nsixty or seventy feet high.\"\n\n\"Well, that settles the point, Dias. We cannot get the animals out\nexcept by the way they came in. As for ourselves, we might climb up at\nsome point in this ravine, but not in the others.\"\n\n\"That is so, senor,\" Dias said. \"The outlook is a bad one--that is to\nsay, we may now be unable to reach the gold river in time--but so long\nas we stay here we may be safe. We have plenty of provisions, we can\ncatch fish in the stream, and no doubt shall find birds in the bushes\nat the lower part of the <DW72>s. I doubt whether the natives will dare\ncome down those precipices at night. If they try to descend by day, we\ncan very well defend ourselves.\"\n\n\"The only question is, How long will it take to tire them out?\"\n\n\"That I cannot tell. We know so little of the Chincas that we have\nnothing to go upon. Some savages have patience enough to wait for any\ntime to carry out their revenge or slay an enemy; others are fickle,\nand though they may be fierce in attack, soon tire of waiting, and are\neager to return to their homes again. I cannot think that they will\nspeedily leave. They have assembled, many of them perhaps from\nconsiderable distances; they have had two days' march up here, and have\nlost at least two of their comrades. I think they will certainly not\nleave until absolutely convinced that they cannot get at us, but\nwhether they may come to that decision in two days or a month I cannot\nsay.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nDEFEAT OF THE NATIVES\n\n\nBertie, who had joined Harry when he saw Dias approaching, had listened\nsilently to their talk, then said:\n\n\"Don't you think that, by loading the mules and moving towards the\nmouth of the next gorge just as it is getting dark, we might induce the\nChincas to think that we are going that way, and so to follow along the\ntop of the hills. We might, as soon as night has fallen, come back\nagain and go down the stream. Of course there may be some of them left\nto watch the mouth of the ravine, but we could drive them off easily\nenough, and get a long start before the fellows on the hills know what\nhas happened.\"\n\nNone of the others spoke immediately; then Harry said:\n\n\"The idea is a good one as far as it goes. But you see at present we\nare in a very strong position. If we leave this and they overtake us in\nthe woods, we shall not have the advantages that we have here.\"\n\n\"Yes, I see that, Harry; but almost anything is better than having to\nwait here and lose our chance of finding that gold.\"\n\n\"We can't help that, Bertie. You know how much that gold would be to\nme, but, as I said this morning, I will run no desperate risks to\nobtain it. When I started upon this expedition I knew that the chances\nof success were extremely slight, and that there might be a certain\namount of danger to encounter from wild beasts and perhaps brigands;\nbut I had never calculated upon such a risk as this, and certainly I am\nnot prepared to accept the responsibility of leading others into it.\"\n\nThere was again silence, which was broken at last by Dias.\n\n\"The proposal of the young senor is a very bold one; but, as you say,\nDon Harry, after leaving our position we should be followed and\nsurrounded. In the forest that would be very bad. I should say let us\nwait for at least a week; that will still give us time to reach the\ngold valley. By then the savages may have left, and some other plan may\nhave occurred to us; at any rate, at the end of a week we shall see how\nthings go. The Indians may have made an attack, and may lose heart\nafter they are repulsed. They may find difficulty in procuring food,\nthough I hardly think that is probable. Still, many things may occur in\na week. If at the end of that time they are still here, we can decide\nwhether to try some such plan as the young senor has thought of, or\nwhether to wait until the Indians leave, and then return to Cuzco; for\nI feel certain that the place cannot be found except by the help of the\nstar.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" Bertie said, \"could we not hit upon some plan to frighten\nthem?\"\n\n\"What sort of plan, Bertie?\"\n\n\"Well, of course we could not make a balloon--I mean a\nfire-balloon--because we have no paper to make it with. If we could,\nand could let it up at night, with some red and blue fires to go off\nwhen it got up high, I should think it would scare them horribly.\"\n\n\"Yes; but it would be still better, Bertie, if we could make a balloon\nbig enough to carry us and the mules and everything else out of this\nplace, and drop us somewhere about the spot we want to get to.\"\n\n\"Oh, it is all very well to laugh, Harry! I said, I knew we could not\nmake a fire-balloon; I only gave that as an example. If we had powder\nenough we might make some rockets, and I should think that would scare\nthem pretty badly.\"\n\n\"Yes, but we haven't got powder, Bertie. We have plenty of cartridges\nfor sporting purposes, or for fighting; but a rocket is a thing that\nwants a lot of powder, besides saltpetre and charcoal, and so on.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, I know that,\" Bertie said testily. \"My suggestion was that\nwe might frighten them somehow, and I still don't see why we shouldn't\nbe able to do it. Let us try to hit upon something else.\"\n\n\"There is a good deal in what the young senor says,\" Dias said gravely.\n\"All the Indians are very superstitious, and think anything they don't\nunderstand is magic. It is worth thinking over: but before we do\nanything else we might find out how many of them there are at the other\nend of the ravine. Only a few may be left, or possibly the whole tribe\nmay be gathered there at nightfall. To-night nothing will be settled,\nbut to-morrow night I will go down the torrent with Jose. I will carry\nyour double-barrelled guns with me, senor, if you will let me have\nthem. When we get to the other end I will take up my station there.\nJose is small and active. He could crawl forward and ascertain how many\nof them there are. If he should be discovered, which is not likely, he\nwould run back to me. I should have four barrels ready to pour into\nthem. That would stop them, for they would think we were all there and\nwere going to attack them, and before they could recover from their\nalarm we should be back here again.\"\n\n\"That seems a good plan, Dias; but I do not see why Bertie and I should\nnot go down with you.\"\n\n\"It would be better not, senor. In the first place, they may have men\nposted at their end of the ravine, and though two of us might crawl\ndown without being seen, just as they crawled up here, they would be\nmore likely to see four; in the next place, they might chance to crawl\ndown the hillside above just as we were going down the ravine, and\nMaria and the animals would be at their mercy.\"\n\n\"They are hardly likely to choose the exact moment when we are to be\naway, but I quite agree with you that the risk must not be run.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Bertie said, returning to his former idea, \"if Dias can go down\nthere, I still think that somehow we might get up a scare.\"\n\nHarry laughed.\n\n\"Well, you think it over, Bertie. If you can suggest anything, I\npromise you that Dias and I will do our best to carry it out.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" Bertie replied gravely, \"I will think it over.\"\n\n\"Now,\" Harry said, \"we had better sleep in watches at night; one must\nbe at the breast-work, and one must listen for noises on the cliffs. It\nwould be hardly possible for a number of men to crawl down without\nexciting suspicion or putting in motion some small stones.\"\n\n\"I do not think, senor,\" Dias said, \"that it will be necessary to keep\nthat watch, for, as we knew from the noise when you fired last night,\nthere are numbers of birds and at least one beast--I fancy it is a bear\nfrom the sound of its roar--up there, and it would be strange if a\nnumber of men making their way down did not disturb some of them;\nindeed, if one bird gave the alarm, it would put them all in motion;\nbesides, there are certainly monkeys, for I heard their cries and\nchattering when the birds flew up. Still, it is perhaps as well that\none of us should watch. Shall we divide, as we did last night? only, of\ncourse, Jose takes his place with you.\"\n\n\"I quite agree with you, Dias. Bertie, you had better get three hours'\nsleep at once, and then after dinner we will sit by the fire here,\nsmoke, and listen, and Dias will watch the gorge and keep one ear open\nin this direction too. It is a comfort to know that if we cannot get\naway by going up the stream, the Indians cannot get down to attack us\nfrom that direction.\"\n\nTwo nights and days passed. The Indians were still on the hills, and\nonce or twice men came down some distance, but a shot from Harry's\nrifle sent them speedily back again. The third night Bertie was on\nwatch; he saw nothing, but suddenly there came three sharp taps. He\ndischarged one barrel of his gun at random down the ravine, and then\nheld himself ready to fire the other as soon as he saw anyone\napproaching. It was an anxious minute for him before the other three\nran up.\n\n\"What is it, Bertie; have you seen anything?\"\n\n\"No, but three arrows tapped against the wall, so I fired one barrel to\ncall you up, and have been looking out for someone to take a shot at\nwith the other; but I have not seen anyone, though, as you may imagine,\nI looked out sharply.\"\n\n\"It is probable that after the lesson they got the other night they did\nnot come so near, and that they merely shot their arrows to see if we\nwere still on guard. However, we may as well stay here for a bit to see\nif anything comes of it.\"\n\nNothing happened, however, and they returned to the tents. Next morning\nBertie said to his brother:\n\n\"Look here, Harry, I have been thinking over that plan of mine. I\nreally think there is something to be done with it.\"\n\n\"Well, tell us your plan.\"\n\n\"In the first place, how much powder can you spare?\"\n\n\"There is that great powder-horn Jose drags about with him to charge\nhis musket with. It will contain about a couple of pounds, I should\nsay.\"\n\n\"That ought to do, I think.\"\n\n\"Well, what is your plan, Bertie?\"\n\n\"In the first place, do you think that burned wood would do for\ncharcoal?\"\n\n\"It depends on what purpose you want it for.\"\n\n\"I want it to prevent the powder from going off with a bang.\"\n\n\"Oh, well, I should think that burned wood ground to a powder would be\njust as good as charcoal. So you are still thinking of rockets? Your\ntwo pounds of powder won't make many of them--not above two fair-sized\nones, and the betting is they would not go up.\"\n\n\"No, I am not thinking of rockets, but of squibs and crackers. I know\nwhen I was at school I made a lot of these, and they worked very well.\nMy idea is that if we could crawl up close to where the Indians are\nassembled, each carrying a dozen squibs and as many crackers, we could\nlight a lot of the crackers first and chuck them among them, and then\nsend the squibs whirling about over their heads, with a good bang at\nthe end. It would set them off running, and they would never stop till\nthey were back in their own forests.\"\n\n\"Well, I really do think that that is a fine idea--a splendid idea! The\nonly drawback is, that in order to carry it out we should want a lot of\nstrong cartridge-paper, and we have no paper except our note-books.\"\n\n\"I have thought of that, Harry, though it bothered me for a good long\ntime. You see, the cases are only to hold the powder and to burn\nregularly as the powder does. At first I thought we might find some\nwood like elder and get the pith out, just as we used to do for\npop-guns, but that unfortunately would not burn. We might, however,\nmake them of linen.\"\n\n\"But we have no linen.\"\n\n\"No, but our leather bed-bags are lined with that coarse sort of stuff\nthey cover mattresses with.\"\n\n\"Tick, you mean?\"\n\n\"Yes, tick. Now, it struck me that this would do for the crackers. We\nshould have to cut it in strips three or four times the width of the\ncracker. Then we could get Maria to make us some stiff paste; starch\nwould be better, but of course we have none. Then, taking a strip of\nthe cloth, we would turn over one side of it an inch from the edge to\nmake a sort of trough, pour in the gunpowder, carefully paste all the\nrest of it and fold it over and over, and then, when it begins to dry,\ndouble it up and tie it with string. We should then only have to add\ntouch-paper, which, of course, we could make out of anything, and put\ninto the end fold. We could break up a few of the cartridges, soak them\nin wetted powder, and then cut them up into small pieces and stick them\ninto the ends of the crackers. I think that would do first-rate. I have\nmade dozens of crackers, and feel sure that I could turn out a good lot\nof them now. The squibs will be easier; we should only have to paste\none side of the strips and roll them up so as to form suitable cases.\nWhen these are dry we should put a thimbleful of powder into each, and\nthen fill them up with powder and charcoal. In order to make sure of a\nloud bang we could undo a piece of rope and wind the strands round each\ncase for an inch and a half from the bottom. Of course, when we had\nground down the burned wood we would mix it with powder and try one or\ntwo of the squibs, so as to find the proportions of charcoal to be\nused.\"\n\n\"You have evidently thought it all out well, and I think it does you no\nend of credit. I authorize you to begin the experiment at once. The\nfirst thing, of course, will be to get some wood and char it. I should\nthink that you would require at least two pounds of that to two pounds\nof powder; but you had better only do a little at first--just enough to\nmake an experiment. You know it will require ramming down well.\"\n\nWhen Dias, who was on watch, returned he found Bertie at work burning\npieces of wood and scraping off the charred surface. Harry explained\nthe plan to him. As he had frequently seen fireworks at Lima, Dias\nquickly grasped the idea.\n\n\"It is splendid, senor; those things will frighten them far more than\nguns. They will think so many devils have got among them, and we will\nheighten the effect by discharging every piece that we can among them.\nIn their confusion they will think it is the fireworks that are killing\nthem. That would be necessary, for otherwise when they recovered from\nthe panic and found that no one had been hurt, they might summon up\ncourage to return.\"\n\nAt noon the next day Bertie with assistance had four squibs and two\ncrackers ready for trial. The squibs contained respectively one, two,\nthree, and four parts of charcoal to one of powder.\n\n\"Don't hold them in your hand while you are trying the experiment,\nBertie. Lay them down on that stone one by one and touch them off with\na burning brand from the fire, and take care that you have a good long\none.\"\n\nAll, with the exception of Jose who was on watch, gathered round. The\nfirst squib exploded with a bang, the second did the same, but with\nless violence, the third went off in an explosive spurt, the fourth\nburned as a squib should do, though a little fiercely, and gave a good\nbang at the end.\n\n\"They go off rather too rapidly, Bertie,\" Harry said; \"we should want\nthem to whiz about in a lively way as long as possible. I should put in\nfive parts of that burned wood next time.\"\n\n\"I will try at once,\" Bertie said. \"I have got lots of cases made, and\nenough burned stuff to make eight or ten more.\"\n\nThe mixture was soon made and another case charged, Bertie ramming down\nthe mixture with a stick which he had cut to fit exactly, and a heavy\nstone as a hammer. This was done after each half-spoonful of the\nmixture was poured in. Then he inserted a strip of his touch-paper.\n\n\"I will take this in my hand,\" he said, \"there is no fear of its\nexploding. I want to throw it into the air and see how it burns there.\"\n\nThe touch-paper was lit, and when the mixture started burning Bertie\nwaved the squib high above his head and threw it into the air. It flew\nalong some fifteen yards and then exploded.\n\n\"I don't think you can better that, Bertie. But you might make the\ncases a bit stronger; it burned out a little too quickly. We shall\nprobably not be able to get very close to them.\"\n\nThe cracker was equally satisfactory, except that they agreed that a\nsomewhat larger charge of powder should be used to increase the noise\nof the explosion.\n\n\"Now, Bertie,\" Harry said, \"we will put all hands on to the business.\nDonna Maria shall make a good stock of paste, and cut the tick into\nstrips for both widths. You shall make the cases for the squibs. Dias\nand I will take charge of the manufacture of charcoal. That will be a\nlong job, for as you have two pounds of gunpowder we shall want ten of\nthis charred wood.\"\n\n\"Not quite as much as that, Harry, because we shall want the powder\nalone for the crackers and the bangs of the squibs, and also for making\nthe touch-paper for all of them.\"\n\n\"Well, we will say ten pounds, anyhow. We have a big stock of\ncartridges, and can spare a few of them for so good a purpose.\"\n\nThey were soon at work. By night the cases were all made and drying,\nand were left near the fire so as to be ready for filling in the\nmorning.\n\nDias then said: \"Jose will go down to-night, senor. Of course I shall\ngo with him. We must find out, in the first place, how near the mouth\nof the ravine the savages are gathered, whether they keep any watch,\nand what force they have. It will be well not to make ourselves known\nto them until at least the greater part are gathered there. If we were\nonly to scare a small party, the others, when they came down, would\nknow nothing of the panic, and might take up the pursuit.\"\n\n\"I wish we had some means of driving them off the top of the hill,\nDias.\"\n\n\"I don't see how that can be done, senor. But probably in another day\nor two they will all go down of their own accord. They must by this\ntime have satisfied themselves that there is no getting at us from\nabove, and that it would be too dangerous to attempt a descent here\nunder the fire of our guns. They will be very likely, instead, to go\ndown to-morrow or next day to hold a general council, and in that case\nthey may decide either to risk climbing down at night, or to make a\ngrand assault on the breast-work. Or, if they cannot bring themselves\nto that, they may decide to leave half a dozen men to watch the\nentrance, while the rest scatter themselves over the forests. In that\ncase the watchers would only have to go off and summon them when we\nstarted again. As they might well imagine that we should not find\nanother position like this again, I expect that is what they will do.\nIf there are a hundred of them, they will find it difficult to feed\nthemselves long. Certainly the men on the hills will get little to eat\nup there.\"\n\n\"Well, Dias, be sure you warn Jose to be careful. They may be posting\nsentries at the mouth of the ravine, just as they are keeping them at\nthis end.\"\n\n\"They may be, but I do not think it is likely; they will know that we\ncould not abandon our animals, and that if we passed through they would\nhave no difficulty in over-taking us, and would then have us at their\nmercy. The last thing they would want is to prevent us from leaving\nthis position. They certainly would not fear an attack from us, knowing\nthat there are but four of us and a woman. Therefore, I think it\nprobable that they will keep at some little distance from the entrance,\nso as to tempt us to come out.\"\n\n\"I hope it is so, Dias. Still, Jose will have to be very careful.\"\n\n\"He will be careful, senor. He knows his own life will depend upon his\ncrawling along as noiselessly as a snake. If he is seen, of course he\nwill come at all speed back to me; and, unless he is hit by a chance\narrow, he will not run much risk, for by the time they are ready to\nshoot he will be out of sight on such dark nights as these, and in the\nshade of the mountains and trees. I shall be ready to send four barrels\nof buck-shot among them when they come up. That is sure to stop them\nlong enough to allow us to get under the cover of your rifles before\nthey can overtake us.\n\n\"I don't think that you need be at all uneasy about him, senor. We will\nstart in an hour's time, so that Jose can get near them before they go\nto sleep. They will probably have a fire burning, but if not the only\nguide to their position will be the sound of their talking. He will\nstrip before he leaves me, so that if they catch sight of him, they\nwill suppose that he is one of themselves.\"\n\nBertie now relieved Jose, who came back and had a long talk with Dias.\n\n\"We are ready now, senor.\"\n\n\"Here is my fowling-piece. It is already loaded with buck-shot. Bertie\nhas taken down his rifle and gun, and will give you the latter as you\npass. I suppose Jose will take no weapons?\"\n\n\"Only a long knife, senor, that may be useful if he comes upon one of\nthem suddenly.\"\n\nAt the barricade Jose stripped, retaining only a pair of sandals. These\nwere as noiseless as his bare feet, and would be needed, as in the dark\nhe might tread upon a thorny creeper, or strike against a projecting\nrock.\n\n\"Good-bye, Jose!\" Harry said. \"Now, be careful. It would be a great\ngrief to us if anything happened to you.\"\n\n\"I will be careful, senor. The Indians won't catch me, never fear.\"\n\nHarry and Bertie both shook hands with him, and then he and Dias\nstepped into the water, and, keeping close along by the wall of rock,\nstarted on their perilous expedition.\n\n\"I don't like it, Bert,\" Harry said as they lost sight of them. \"It\nseems a cowardly thing to let that lad go into danger while we are\ndoing nothing.\"\n\n\"That is just what I feel, Harry. I would have volunteered willingly,\nbut he will do it a great deal better than either you or I could.\"\n\n\"There is no doubt about that,\" Harry agreed. \"Of course when he is out\nwith the mules he often travels at night, and certainly both he and\nDias can see in the dark a good deal better than we can.\"\n\nThere was suddenly a slight movement behind them, and they turned\nsharply round. \"It is I, senor. I am anxious about Dias, and I didn't\nlike staying there by myself. I thought you would not mind if I came up\nand sat by you.\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" Harry said. \"Sit down and make yourself comfortable. I\ndo not think there is any fear for Dias. He cannot be taken by\nsurprise, for he will hear by their shouting if they discover Jose, and\nyou may be quite sure that he will bring them to a stand with the four\nshots he will fire among them as they come near, and so will get a good\nstart. They might run faster than he can in the forest, but will\nscarcely be better able to make their way up the torrent.\"\n\nWhen Dias had been gone twenty minutes their conversation ceased, and\nthey sat listening intently. In another ten minutes, which seemed an\nhour to them, Harry said, \"The savages can keep no watch at their end\nof the torrent, and Jose must have got safely away.\"\n\nVery slowly the time passed.\n\n\"They must have been gone an hour,\" Bertie said at last.\n\n\"Quite that, I should think, Bertie. At any rate, we may feel assured\nthat all has gone well so far. For, though we might not hear the yells\nof the savages over the rustle and roar of the torrent, we should\ncertainly hear gunshots.\"\n\nAnother half-hour passed, and then to their relief they heard Dias call\nout, \"All is well!\" some little distance down. In three or four minutes\nthey could see the two figures approaching. \"Give me your guns, Dias,\"\nHarry said, \"and then I will help you up the rocks. They might go off\nif you were to make a slip. Now, while Jose is putting on his clothes,\ntell me what he has found out.\"\n\n\"I have not heard much, senor. As soon as he rejoined me we started\noff, and, coming up the torrent, we had not much chance of talking. He\ntold me that there were many of them, and that they were camped at some\nlittle distance from the stream, just as I thought they would be.\"\n\n\"I will stay here, Harry,\" Bertie said. \"You can hear the news and then\ncome and tell me.\"\n\n\"Very well. I will be back before long.\"\n\nDias, his wife, and Harry walked down towards the tent, and Bertie\nchatted with Jose while the latter was dressing.\n\n\"You must feel horribly cold, Jose,\" he said.\n\n\"I am cold, now I think of it. I did not notice it while I was watching\nthe savages. When I took to the water again I did feel it. Maria will\nmake me a cup of hot coffee, and then I shall be all right again. It\nwas good fun to look at them, and know that they had no idea that I was\nso close. If I could have understood their language, I should have\nlearned something worth telling. I felt inclined to scare them by\ngiving a tremendous yell, and I know I could have got away all right.\nThey were sitting round a big fire and would not have been able to see\nin the dark. I should have done it, only I thought Dias would have\nblamed me for letting them know that one of us had come down the canyon.\"\n\n\"He would have been angry, Jose, and so would my brother, for they\nwould certainly have set a watch afterwards, which would have spoilt\nall our plans. Now run along, your teeth are chattering, and the sooner\nyou get something warm and wrap yourself up in your blankets the\nbetter.\"\n\nThe fire had burnt low when the others returned, but an armful of\nsticks was thrown upon it at once. The kettle had been left in the\nembers at its edge by Maria when she started, so that after it had hung\nin the blaze for two or three minutes it began to boil, and coffee was\nsoon ready. At this point Jose ran in, and after he had drunk a large\nmugful he told them what he had learned.\n\n\"When I left Dias at the mouth of the ravine,\" he said, \"everything\nseemed quiet. I walked along the edge of the stream for fifty yards,\nkeeping my ears open, you may be sure, and I saw a light glow close\nunder the rocks some distance on the other side of the river. I\nfollowed the stream down till I came to a place where there was a quiet\npool, and there I swam across, then very carefully I made my way to\nwhere I could see the light. It was quite three hundred yards from the\nriver. As I got near I could hear talking; I crawled along like a cat,\nand took good care not to disturb a leaf, or to put a hand or a knee\nupon a dried stick, for I could not tell whether they had anyone on\nwatch near the fire. I perceived no one, and at last came to a point\nwhere I could see the flame. It was in an opening running a hundred\nfeet into the mountains, and perhaps forty feet across at the mouth.\n\n\"In this were sixty or seventy savages sitting or standing round a\nfire, which had evidently been made there so that anyone coming down to\nthe mouth of the ravine should not see it. The fire was not a very\nlarge one, and a good many of the men were gathered outside the little\nhollow. Some of them were talking loudly, and it seemed to me that they\nwere quarrelling over something. Sometimes they pointed up to the top\nof the hills, sometimes towards the mouth of our ravine. I would have\ngot close if I had understood their language. Presently I saw some of\nthem lying down, so that I could see that the quarrel, whatever it was\nabout, was coming to an end, and that they were going to lie down for\nthe night. As I could learn nothing further I crawled away and went\ndown to the place where I had swum the river before, and then crept\nquietly up to Dias, who was on the look-out; for although I had seen no\none as I had passed before, there might still have been some of them on\nthe watch.\"\n\n\"You have done very well, Jose,\" Harry said. \"We have learned two\nthings. First, that they are not keeping watch at the mouth of the\nravine, either because they feel sure that we will not try to escape,\nor because they wish us to leave and are giving us the opportunity of\ndoing so. In the second place, you have learned what force they have\ngot down there, their exact position, and the fact that they were\nevidently arguing how they had best attack us. Well, from what you say\nthere is every chance that we shall be able to come upon them without\nbeing noticed till we are close enough to throw our fireworks among\nthem. Really the only thing for us to learn is whether many of them are\nstill at the top of the hill.\"\n\n\"I hardly think there can be many; only a few have shown themselves\nto-day. They must know very well that we would not venture to climb up\nduring the day, and that it would be next to impossible for us to do so\nin the dark, even if we made up our minds to abandon the animals and\nall our stores.\"\n\n\"Well, I should say, Dias, there is no reason why we should put the\nmatter off. It will not take us long to load all the squibs to-morrow.\nMy opinion is that at dusk we had better saddle the mules and pack\neverything on them in readiness for a start; then at ten o'clock we can\ngo down and attack the savages. The best moment for doing so will be\nwhen they are just lying down. When we have sent them flying we will\ncome up the torrent again, and start with the mules as soon as it is\ndaylight. It would be next to impossible to get them down in the dark,\nas they might very easily break their legs, or by rubbing against the\nwall shift their packs and tumble them into the water.\"\n\n\"It would be a pity to waste time, senor. I will get some torches made\nto-morrow. Some of the trees have resin, and by melting this I can make\ntorches that would do very well. By their aid we could get the mules\ndown without waiting for daylight. As they have already come up the\ntorrent, they will have less fear in going down, for the stream will\nhelp them instead of keeping them back. I will go first with Jose and\nhis mule; she is as steady as a rock, and where she goes the others\nwill follow; and with five torches along the line they will be able to\nsee well enough.\"\n\n\"Four torches, Dias. Your wife rode coming up, and she had better ride\ngoing down.\"\n\n\"She can hold a torch as she sits; it does not matter to us if we get\nwet to the waist, but it would be very uncomfortable for her. We shall\nhave to put the largest burdens on to the mules. One of the riding\nmules could carry the two llamas, or if you think that that is too\nmuch, we can tie each across a separate mule. They were more trouble\ncoming up than all the mules put together. We had pretty nearly to\ncarry them through the deep places, though at other points they leapt\nfrom rock to rock cleverly enough.\"\n\n\"I am not going to be left behind if you are going to the fight,\nsenor,\" Donna Maria said, \"if you will give me one of your pistols.\"\n\n\"We could manage that, I should think,\" Harry said. \"We can put you on\none of the steadiest mules when we first go down, and with one at each\nside of you we can manage it very well. Jose must go on a hundred yards\nahead to see whether any of the savages are on the watch at their end,\nand if so, you must wait till we have cleared them out. You see, we\nshall have no hesitation in shooting any of them if necessary, and\nthough that would bring the rest of them down on us, yet when our\nsquibs and crackers begin to fly among them, you may be sure they won't\nface us for an instant.\"\n\nDias grumbled that his wife had better stay where she was till they\nwent back for the mules; but Harry said: \"I do think, Dias, that she\nhad better go with us. It would be cruel to leave her now that we are\ngoing into a fight--leave her all alone to tremble for our lives, with\na knowledge that if things should go wrong with us the savages will\nsoon be up here.\"\n\n\"Well, senor, if you think so, there is no more to be said.\"\n\n\"I am not going to be made a trouble of,\" Maria said. \"I shall go down\non foot like the rest of you. I will take some other clothes with me,\nso that when you all come back for the mules I can change into them.\"\n\n\"Perhaps that would be the best plan,\" Harry agreed. \"Now I will go\nback and take Bertie's place. It is my turn to be on watch, and he will\nbe wanting to hear the news.\"\n\n\"Well, Harry, is it all right?\" Bertie asked as he heard his brother\ncoming up to him.\n\n\"It couldn't be better! There are sixty or seventy of them in a sort of\nlittle ravine three hundred yards away, on the left-hand side of the\nriver. They don't seem to be keeping guard at all, and if they are not\nmore careful to-morrow night we shall take them completely by surprise.\nWe are going to saddle all the mules directly it gets too dark for any\nof the fellows on the hills to see us, then we must set to work and\npull down enough of the barricade here to allow them to pass. We\nourselves, when we go down, will cross at that shallow place above\nhere, and go down the river at that side, otherwise we sha'n't be able\nto cross it except at some distance beyond the other end of the\ntorrent. Of course the mules must go down this side, as we shall want\nto turn to the right when we get off. We shall make our attack about\nten o'clock.\"\n\nBertie went off, and three hours later Dias relieved Harry. As soon as\nit was light the next morning Bertie and Jose set to work to fill the\ncases--there were a hundred squibs and fifty large crackers.\n\nDonna Maria after breakfast went out and returned with a number of\nflexible sticks of about half an inch in diameter; these she carried\ninto her tent, where she shut herself up for the forenoon. When, at one\no'clock, she came out with the result of her work, it resembled a chair\nwithout legs and with a back about a foot wide and three feet high.\n\n\"What in the world have you got there, Donna Maria?\" Bertie asked.\n\n\"Don't you know?\"\n\n\"No, I have never seen a thing like it before.\"\n\n\"This is the thing the porters use for carrying weights, and sometimes\npeople, over the Cordilleras. You see that strap near the top goes\nround the man's forehead, and when there is a weight in the chair these\nother straps pass over his shoulders and under his arms, and then round\nwhatever is on the seat.\"\n\n\"But what is going to be on the seat?\"\n\n\"I am,\" she laughed. \"Dias is so overbearing. It had all been arranged\nnicely, as you know; and then when he spoke to me afterwards he said,\n'The first thing to-morrow morning, Maria, you will set to work to make\na porter's chair, and I shall carry you down the stream. No words about\nit, but do as you are told.' Generally Dias lets me have my own way,\nsenor, but when he talks like that, I know that it is useless to argue\nwith him. And perhaps it is best after all, for, as he said to me\nafterwards, it is a nasty place for men to get along, but for a woman,\nwith her petticoats dragging and trailing round her, it would be almost\nimpossible for her to keep her footing.\"\n\n\"Well, I thought the same thing myself when we were talking about it\nyesterday,\" Bertie said. \"Of course I did not say anything, but I am\nsure Dias is right. I found it very hard work to keep my footing, and I\nreally don't believe that I could have done it if I had been dressed as\na woman. And Dias can carry you like that?\"\n\n\"Carry me, senor! he could carry three times that weight. He has cut\nhimself a staff seven or eight feet long this morning to steady\nhimself, but I don't think there was any need for it. Why, it is a\ncommon thing for people to be carried over the Cordilleras so, and Dias\nis stronger a great deal than many of the men who do it. As he said, if\nI had been going through on foot you would all have been bothering\nabout me. And it is not as if two people could go abreast, and one help\nthe other. There is often only room between the rocks for one to pass\nthrough, and it is just there where the rush of the water is strongest.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nTHE SIGNAL STAR\n\n\nDuring the afternoon Dias, who had been keeping a careful look-out at\nthe cliffs, said to Harry: \"I think, senor, that the savages are\nleaving the hills. An hour ago I saw a man walking along where we\ngenerally see them; he was going straight along as if for some fixed\npurpose, and I thought at once that he might be bringing them some\nmessage from the people below us. I lost sight of him after a bit, but\npresently I could make out some men moving in the other direction. They\nwere keeping back from the edge, but I several times caught sight of\ntheir heads against the sky-line when there happened to be some little\nirregularity in the ground. They were not running, but seemed to me to\nbe going at a steady pace. Since then I have been watching carefully,\nand have seen no one on the other side. I think they have all been sent\nfor, and will be assembled this afternoon at the mouth of the torrent.\"\n\n\"I am very glad to hear it, Dias; that is just what we wanted.\"\n\n\"In one way--yes,\" Dias said. \"It would be a great thing for us to\ncatch them all together, for I have no fear that they will stand when\nthese fireworks begin to go off among them.\"\n\n\"What is the drawback, then?\"\n\n\"It is, senor, that they have either been collected because they have\ngiven up the hope of catching us at present, and are going to scatter\nand hunt till we venture out, which would be the worst thing possible;\nor they have made up their minds to make a rush upon us.\"\n\n\"Don't you think that we can beat them back?\"\n\n\"Not if they are determined, senor. You see, we can't make them out\ntill they are within twenty or thirty yards of us. At most you and your\nbrother could fire four shots, then you would take up your rifles. We\nshall have then only four shots left. If they continue their rush where\nshall we be? There would be two of us on one wall and two on the other.\nThere would be four shots to fire from one side and four from the\nother. Then the end would come. Two on each side would not be able to\nkeep back the rush of two or three score. In two minutes it would be\nall over.\"\n\n\"Yes, Dias, I see that if they were determined to storm the place and\ntake us alive they could do it; but we have the fireworks.\"\n\n\"I did not think of that. Yes; but having once worked themselves up and\nbeing mad with excitement, even that might not stop them, though I\nshould think it would. Yes, I believe we might feel assured that we\nshould beat them back, and if so, we should hear no more of them.\"\n\n\"If I knew that they would come,\" Harry said, \"I would certainly say we\nhad best stay and defend ourselves; but we can't be sure that that is\ntheir motive for assembling. They may, as you say, be going to move\noff, leaving perhaps half a dozen men to watch the entrance and report\nif we attempt to escape. That would be fatal, and our only chance would\nbe to leave everything behind and endeavour to climb up one side or the\nother; and even that might not avail us, as there may be one or two men\nup there to see if we make off that way. I am more inclined to think\nthat this is the course that they will take rather than risk a heavy\nloss of life. They must have a good idea of what it would cost them to\ntake the place.\"\n\n\"What do you think we had better do, then, senor?\"\n\n\"I think we had better attack them as soon as possible after nightfall.\nIt is likely that they will do nothing before morning; as you say, they\ndo not like moving at night, and if they attack it will not be until\nshortly before daybreak. There is sure to be a palaver when the men who\nhave been on the hills come down. It will be too late then for them to\ngo back before night, so that I think we are pretty sure to find them\nall in the ravine this evening. If, when we get there, we find the\nplace empty, we must come to a decision as to what our best course will\nbe. In that case I think we ought to climb the hills and make our way\nup the mountains as rapidly as possible. We could calculate on eight or\nten hours' start, and by keeping as much as possible on the rocks,\nmight hope to get so high among the mountains that they would not be\nable to follow our traces and overtake us before we reach a point where\nthey would not dare follow us. In that case, of course we should have\nto give up all hope of finding the gold valley, and lose the mules with\nall our belongings, which would <DW36> us terribly.\"\n\n\"Very well, senor; I think that is the best plan.\"\n\n\"Then we will settle to start at nine o'clock, Dias.\"\n\nThey then discussed the arrangements for the attack. Each was to carry\na glowing brand, and when he got there, was to sling his gun behind him\nand hold twelve squibs in one hand and the brand in the other. When\nthey approached within throwing distance of the savages, they were to\nlay their guns down beside them, and then Harry was to put the ends of\nhis squibs against his brand, and hurl the whole of them among the\nIndians. A few seconds later Bertie was to do the same, while Harry\nfired one barrel of buck-shot. Bertie was to fire as Dias threw a dozen\ncrackers, and then Jose was to throw his squibs. Then all were to throw\nsquibs and crackers as far as they could go; and the other two barrels\nof buck-shot and Jose's musket were to be poured in. By this time they\ncalculated the savages would be in full flight, and the three rifles\ncould then be used.\n\nHarry was to hand his rifle to Dias before the firing began, and he and\nBertie were to slip fresh cartridges into these guns and recap them\nbefore sending off the last batch of their fireworks, so as to have\nthem in readiness either to empty their contents into the flying\nIndians, or to cover their retreat should the fireworks fail to effect\nthe panic they hoped for. Their pistols were also to be reserved until\nthe Indians fled. Donna Maria was to stay by the water, and start at\nonce on her way back if Dias shouted to her to do so. Every step of the\nplan settled upon was repeated again and again, until there was no\npossibility of any mistake being made. Maria had not attended the\ncouncil; her confidence in her two white friends was unbounded, and\nBertie's invention of the fireworks had placed him on a level with his\nbrother in her estimation. She therefore quietly went on with her\npreparations for dinner without concerning herself as to the details of\nthe affair.\n\nAs soon as it was dark and the meal eaten, the tents were struck, the\nbaggage all rolled up and packed on the animals, and the fireworks\ndivided. When everything was in readiness they went together and made a\nbreach in the breast-work wide enough for the mules to pass. At nine\no'clock Maria was seated in the carrying-chair, and strapped on to her\nhusband's back; then four brands were taken from the fire and the party\nstarted. When within fifty yards of the lower end of the ravine Jose\nwent forward, and, returning in a few minutes, reported that no savages\nwere on guard. A fire was burning outside the mouth of the ravine where\nhe had seen them on the evening before, and from the reflection on the\nrock he believed that another fire was alight inside. His report caused\na general feeling of relief, for their great fear had been that the\nnatives might have made off before their arrival.\n\nWhen they stepped out from the water Dias set Maria down. \"You\nunderstand, Maria,\" he said: \"the moment I call, you are to start up\nthe river.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" she said. \"I have my knife, and if you do not rejoin me\nI shall know how to use it.\"\n\n\"We shall rejoin you, Maria,\" Dias said confidently. \"I believe that at\nthe first volley of fireworks they will be off. They must be more than\nhuman if they are not scared, as they never can have heard of such\nthings before.\"\n\nKeeping close to the rock wall, they went along in single file until\nwithin forty or fifty yards of the fire; then, going down on their\nhands and knees, they crawled up a slight rise, from the top of which\nthey could see a hundred or more natives gathered round a fire. One was\naddressing the others, who were seated listening attentively. Laying\nthe guns down to be ready for instant action, and keeping themselves\nconcealed in the herbage, Harry took his bundle of squibs from his\npocket. They were but lightly tied together; slipping off the string he\napplied the ends to the brand. There was a sudden roar of fire, and\nwaving them once round his head he hurled them into the midst of the\nassembly. There was a yell of astonishment as the missiles flew hither\nand thither, exploding with loud reports. The last had not exploded\nwhen Bertie's handful flew among them; then came the parcel from Dias,\nand at the same moment Harry poured a barrel of buck-shot among them,\nfollowed by a volley of crackers, while almost simultaneously Harry\nthrew his squibs and Bertie fired a volley of buck-shot. For a moment\nthe savages were paralysed, then many of them threw themselves on their\nfaces in terror of these fiery demons, while others started in headlong\nflight.\n\n\"Send them off as quick as you can!\" Harry shouted, as he discharged\nhis second barrel into the flying natives. Bertie followed suit, and\nthen both paused to reload while Dias and Jose hurled their remaining\nfireworks. By this time the last of the natives had leapt up and fled.\nJose's musket and the three rifles cracked out, and then the little\nparty rose to their feet and joined in a wild \"Hip, hip, hurrah!\"\n\n\"You can come up, Maria; they have all gone!\" Dias cried out; and Maria\njoined them a minute later. More than a score of natives lay dead or\nbadly wounded round their fire.\n\n\"What are we to do with the wounded?\" Bertie asked.\n\n\"We can only leave them where they are,\" Harry said. \"Some of the\nsavages may have wandered away, or not have come down from the hills,\nand will return here unaware of what has happened, or one or two of the\nboldest may venture back again to look after their comrades. At any\nrate, we can do nothing for them.\"\n\n\"It would be better to shoot them, senor,\" Dias said.\n\n\"No, I could not bring myself to do that,\" Harry said. \"Buck-shot,\nunless they strike in a body, are not likely to kill. I expect they are\nmore frightened than hurt. After we have gone many of them will be able\nto crawl down to the river. Savages frequently recover from wounds that\nwould kill white men; and even if no others come down, those who are\nbut slightly wounded will help the more incapable. We have cleared the\nway for ourselves, which was all we wanted, and have taught them a\nlesson they are not likely to forget for many years to come. Let us go\nback at once and bring down the mules. I suppose you will sit down by\nthe stream, and wait till we come back, Maria?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"there is nothing to be afraid of now; but you can\nleave me one of your pistols in case one of these savages may be\nshamming dead.\"\n\n\"Jose will wait with her,\" Dias said. \"Now, Jose, you strike up a song.\nYou are generally at it, and as long as they hear you they will know\nthat some of us are still here, and will not venture to move.\"\n\n\"You take my gun, Jose; it is loaded,\" Harry said. \"If any of them\nshould move and try to crawl away, don't fire at them; but if they look\nabout and seem inclined to make mischief, shoot at once.\"\n\nComing down with the animals the three men carried torches in each\nhand. The mules reached the mouth of the torrent without accident, and\nthe llamas were then lifted off the baggage mules which had carried\nthem, and all were turned loose to graze on the rich grass near the\nedge of the river. Jose and Dias went to the fire in the ravine, and\nreturned laden with burning brands, and a fire was soon blazing near\nthe water. Two of them kept watch by turns at the spot from which they\nhad fired, lest any of the wounded Indians should, on recovering, try\nto avenge their loss by sending arrows down amongst the party. During\nthe night four of the fallen Indians, after first looking round\ncautiously, crawled away, and the watchers could hear them running fast\nthrough the bushes till they were beyond the light of the fire.\n\nAt dawn a start was made. The river was crossed at the pool where Jose\nhad swum over. Dias, on examination, found that the water, even in the\ndeepest part, was not more than breast-high. Accordingly he returned;\nMaria, kneeling on one of his shoulders and one of Harry's, was carried\nacross without being wetted. Then they joined the animals, which were\ngrazing a short distance away, and set off without delay. Although they\nkept a sharp look-out they saw no more of the Indians. They ascended\nseveral more streams unobserved. Rough carvings on the face of several\nof the rocks led them to carry their excursions farther than usual, but\nbeyond a few ounces of gold, washed from the stream, they found nothing.\n\n\"They must have been put here for some purpose,\" said Dias.\n\n\"I have been thinking it over, Dias, and I should not be surprised if,\nas you thought, they were done to deceive searchers. You told me there\nwere some marks by which you would be directed in the gold valley; it\nis quite likely that other marks might have been placed in the valleys\nso that the real ones would not be particularly noticed.\"\n\n\"That is possible, senor; they would certainly do everything they could\nto prevent anyone not in the secret from knowing. The mark I have to\nlook for first is a serpent. It is carved on a rock at the end of a\nvalley.\"\n\n\"In that case the indication of the star would not be necessary, Dias.\"\n\n\"That may be, senor; but the valley may be a large one, and the\nhiding-place very difficult to find, so that even when the valley was\nknown, it would need the guidance of the star to take us to the right\nplace.\"\n\n\"That might be so, Dias, if it were a hidden treasure that we were\nlooking for; but as, according to your account, it is simply an\nextraordinarily rich deposit in the river, I hardly see why the\nguidance of the star should be necessary when once the valley was\nknown.\"\n\n\"That I cannot tell you, senor; but I am sure that it must be difficult\nto find, for the Spaniards searched everywhere for gold, and although\nthe records of most of their discoveries still exist, there is no\nmention of such a find, nor is there is any word of it among the Indian\ntraditions.\"\n\nA week before the appointed date they found themselves in the\nneighbourhood where they felt sure the cleft must lie. Mount Tinta was\ntwenty miles in front of them, and from that point a range of mountains\ntrended off almost at right angles to that which they were following.\nOne lofty peak some thirty miles to the south-east rose above another.\n\n\"I believe that that is the peak,\" Dias said.\n\n\"I don't see any signs of a cleft in it, Dias.\"\n\n\"No, senor; it is a very narrow one.\"\n\nThe next day they halted at the mouth of another valley, and as they\nunloaded the mules, Harry exclaimed: \"See, Dias, there is a cleft in\nthat peak! From here it looks as if it were a mere thread, and as if\nsome giant had struck a mighty sword-cut into it.\"\n\n\"That is right. Sure enough, senor, this must be the valley. Now, let\nus look about for the serpent.\"\n\nThe search did not take them long. An isolated rock rose a quarter of a\nmile from the mouth, and on this was a rude representation of a\nserpent. The next morning they explored the valley thoroughly to a\npoint where, five miles higher, it ceased abruptly, the rocks closing\nin on either side, and the stream coming down in a perpendicular fall\nfrom a point some eighty feet above them. Going down the river, they\nwashed the gravel again and again, but without obtaining even as much\ngold as they had found several times before.\n\n\"I cannot understand it,\" Harry said, as they sat down to their meal at\ndusk. \"Your tradition says nothing about hidden treasure, and yet there\ndoes not seem to be gold in the stream.\"\n\n\"It may be higher up, senor. We must ascend the hills on each side of\nthe valley, and come down upon the river higher up.\"\n\nHarry was on watch that night, and at one o'clock he roused the others\nup. \"See!\" he exclaimed later on; \"there is a bright star apparently\nabout a foot above the peak. I should think that must be the star. No\ndoubt that will rise in exact line behind the cleft on the 21st, that\nis four days from now; probably it can only be seen when we are exactly\nin the line with the cleft and the position of the gold. This cleft is\nundoubtedly very narrow--no doubt the result of an earthquake. It\ncertainly goes straight through, and very likely it is some hundred\nyards across, so that unless we are exactly in the line we sha'n't see\nit. As soon as it is dark on the 21st we will all go some distance up\nthe valley, where it is only about four or five hundred yards across.\nWe will station ourselves fifty yards apart across it, then one of us\nis sure to see the star through the cleft. We had each better take two\nsticks with us. Whoever sees the star will fix one in the ground and\nthen go backwards for a hundred yards, keeping the star in sight, and\nplant the other; then the line between those two sticks ought to lead\nus to the spot.\"\n\nEach night the star rose nearer to the cleft. \"There is no doubt we\nshall see it in the proper position to-morrow night,\" Harry said on the\n20th of the month. \"That certainly is strong proof that the tradition\nhanded down to you, Dias, is correct.\"\n\nThey employed the next day in again searching for some indication that\nmight assist them, but in vain. Dias and Jose both asserted that the\ntiny rift in the rocky peak looked wider from the middle of the valley\nthan at any other point, and even Harry and his brother admitted that\nit could scarcely be seen from the foot of the hills on either side,\nand therefore it was agreed that Dias, Harry, and Jose should take\ntheir places only some forty yards apart across the centre; Maria and\nBertie going farther, near the sides of the hills. When midnight\napproached they took their stations. Suddenly Harry, who was standing\nby the side of the rivulet, exclaimed, \"I see it!\" It was more than a\nminute later before Dias saw it, while it was three or four minutes\nbefore Jose spoke, by which time Harry had crossed the streamlet and\nfixed his second rod some distance on the other side. Dias and Jose did\nthe same. Bertie did not catch sight of it for some time after Jose,\nand Maria did not see it at all. Then they went back to their camping\nplace.\n\n\"It is curious that I should have seen it before either of you, when\nyou were standing so close to me,\" Harry said. \"It was lower than I\nexpected, and it is evident that the cleft must continue much farther\ndown than we thought, and that it must be extremely narrow at the\nbottom. It is certainly a splendid guide, and there can be no mistaking\nit. Unless I had been standing on the exact line, I should not have\nnoticed the star till later, and the crack is so much wider towards the\ntop that it could probably be seen on a line half a mile across. It\nwill be strange if we cannot find the place in the morning. Certainly\nwe searched in the stream just where I was standing, and found nothing.\nBut, of course, it is possible that in all this time it may have\nchanged its course considerably.\"\n\nDias shook his head. \"It can hardly be that, senor, because, in that\ncase, anyone who had examined the valley could have found it. I begin\nto think that it must have been a mistake about its being merely a rich\nplace in the river, and that it must be some vast treasure, perhaps\nhidden by the people before the Incas, and kept by them as a certain\nresource when needed. We shall have to search, I think, for some\nwalled-up cave in the rocks. We have already looked for it, but not\nseriously; and besides, there are many boulders that have fallen, and\nformed a bank at the foot of the cliff.\"\n\n\"Well, we shall know in a few hours. I feel absolutely certain that the\nline between those two sticks will lead us to it.\"\n\nNone attempted to sleep, and as soon as it became light they took picks\nand shovels and started up the valley. Harry gave an exclamation of\nsurprise as, standing behind the first stick, he looked towards the\nsecond. \"The line goes to the middle of that waterfall,\" he said.\n\nThis was so; for the stream made two or three sharp bends between the\nspot where he had crossed it and the foot of the falls.\n\n\"'Tis strange!\" Dias said; \"we have examined that spot more than once.\nThere are great stones and boulders at the foot of the fall, and a\nlarge deep pool. Can a treasure be buried in that? If so, it will be\nhard indeed to get it.\"\n\nHarry did not reply; his face was white with excitement. He walked\nforward slowly till he reached the edge of the pool. It was some\nfifteen yards across, and the colour of the water showed that it was\nvery deep.\n\n\"I will dive, Harry,\" Bertie said; \"I have gone down more than once in\nfive fathoms of water to pick up an egg that has been thrown\noverboard.\" He stripped and swam out to the middle of the pool and\ndived. He was down about a minute, and on coming up swam to the shore.\n\"I could find no bottom, Harry,\" he panted. \"I am sure I must have gone\ndown seven fathoms.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Bertie,\" Harry said quietly; \"we will make up our minds\nthat if it is there, we sha'n't get it at present. The foot of the\nvalley is so flat that it would need a cut at least a mile long to let\nthe water off, and we should therefore require either an army of men or\na regular diving apparatus, which there would be no getting this side\nof England. However, it may not be there. Let us search now behind the\nfall.\"\n\nThere were some four or five feet clear between the sheet of water and\nthe rock. At times, as Harry pointed out, there would be an even wider\nspace, for the weather had been dry for the past two months, and the\nquantity of water coming down was but small, while in the wet season a\nmighty flood would shoot far out from the rock. The width of the stream\nin the wet season was shown by the broad bed of what was now but a\nrivulet. Looking upwards as they stood, the wall actually overhung\nthem, and they could see the edge where the water poured over unbroken.\n\n\"There may be a cave here,\" Harry went on, \"and it may be covered by\nthese rocks piled up for the purpose. On the other hand, they may have\nfallen. I think that is the most likely explanation, for as the top\nprojects beyond the bottom it is possible that some time or other there\nwas a big fall.\"\n\nThey searched every foot of the rock within reach, but there were no\nsigns of any man's handiwork. The rock was solid, thickly covered with\ndripping moss and ferns which had flourished in the mist and spray that\nrose from the foot of the fall. This they had ruthlessly scraped off\nwith their picks. Silently they went out again at the end, and stood\nhopelessly looking at the fall. It was some time before Harry said, \"We\nmust move some of those stones now. Let us go at once and cut down some\nyoung trees, for we can do nothing with our hands alone, but must use\nlevers. For that purpose we shall want straight wood, and strong. We\nhad better get half a dozen, in case some of them break; make them\nabout ten feet long, and from four to six inches thick, and sharpened\nslightly at the lower end.\"\n\nIn an hour the levers were ready.\n\n\"We had better breakfast before we begin, Dias. Your wife went off to\nprepare it when we came out from the waterfall. I dare say it is ready\nby this time.\"\n\nIn half an hour they were back again. They chose the central spot\nbehind the fall, and then set to work. Some of the rocks were dislodged\nwithout much difficulty, but to move others, it was necessary to first\nget out the smaller ones, on which they rested. So they toiled on,\nstopping for half an hour in the middle of the day for food, and then\nrenewing their work. By evening they had made an opening four or five\nfeet wide at the top, and six feet deep, close to the wall. It was now\ngetting dark, and all were fagged and weary with their work, the light\nwas fading, and they were glad to return to camp. Maria came out to\nmeet them. She asked no questions, but said cheerfully, \"I have a good\nolla ready, I am sure you must want it.\"\n\n\"I feel almost too tired to eat,\" Bertie said.\n\n\"You will feel better when you have had some coffee. I have fed the\nmules, Jose, and taken them down to water.\"\n\n\"I think,\" Bertie said, when they had finished their meal, \"that we\nmight splice the main brace.\"\n\n\"I do think we might,\" Harry laughed. \"We have not opened a bottle\nsince we started, and certainly we have worked like <DW65>s since seven\no'clock this morning. I will open the case; it is screwed down, and I\nhave a screwdriver in the handle of my knife;\" and he rose to his feet.\n\n\"What does Don Bertie want?\" Dias said. \"I will get it, senor. I do not\nunderstand what he said.\"\n\n\"It is a sea expression, Dias. After a hard day's work the captain\norders that the main brace shall be spliced, which means that the crew\nshall have a glass of grog--that is, a glass of spirits and water--to\ncheer and warm them after their exertions. Jose, will you bring a\nblazing brand with you? I shall want it to see the screws.\"\n\nIn a few minutes he returned.\n\n\"This is brandy, Dias. I don't suppose you have ever tasted a glass of\ngood brandy. Is your kettle boiling still, senora? We shall want hot\nwater, sugar, and five of the tin mugs. Have you any of those limes we\npicked the other day?\"\n\n\"Yes, senor.\"\n\n\"That is good. Just a slice each will be an improvement.\" Harry mixed\nfour mugs, and a half one for Maria. \"There, Dias!\" he said. \"You will\nallow that that is a considerable improvement on pulque.\"\n\nHe and his brother had already lighted their pipes. The other three had\nmade cigarettes. Dias and Jose were loud in their commendations of the\nnew beverage. Donna Maria had at first protested that she never touched\npulque, and this must be the same sort of thing. However, after sipping\ndaintily, she finished her portion with evident satisfaction. They did\nnot sit up long, and as soon as they had finished their first smoke all\nretired to bed, leaving for once the llamas and mules to act as\nsentries. As soon as it was fairly daylight, they drank a cup of coffee\nand started again to work. Harry went first into the hole they had\nmade, and, kneeling down, struck a match to enable him to see the rock\nmore thoroughly. He gave a slight exclamation, then said: \"Open your\nknife, Bertie, and come in here and strike another match. I want both\nmy hands.\"\n\n\"I have a torch here, senor,\"\n\n\"That is best; then light it, Bertie.\"\n\nThere was just room at the bottom for Bertie to stand by the side of\nhis brother, who was lying down.\n\n\"Hold the torches as low as you can, Bertie.\"\n\nHarry picked away with the point of his knife for a minute or two and\nthen sat up.\n\n\"That is the top of a cave,\" he said. \"Do you see, this crack along\nhere is a straight one. That, I fancy, was the top of the entrance to\nthe cave. That stone under it has a rough face, but on the top and\nsides it is straight. It is fitted in with cement, or something of that\nsort, and is soft for some distance in, and then becomes quite hard. I\ncan just see that there are two stones underneath, also regularly cut.\"\n\nHe made room for Bertie to lie down, and held the torch for him. \"I\nthink you are right, Harry. Those three stones would never fit together\nso closely if they had not been cut by hand, though, looking at the\nface, no one could tell them from the rock above them.\"\n\nDias next examined the stones.\n\n\"There is no doubt that that is the entrance to a cave, senor,\" he said\nas he joined them; and the three went out beyond the fall, for the\nnoise of the water was too great for them to converse without\ndifficulty behind the veil of water. Jose stayed behind to examine.\n\n\"Well, Dias, we have found the place where the treasure is hidden, but\nI don't think that we are much nearer. Certainly we have not strength\nsufficient to clear away those fallen stones, and probably the cave is\nblocked by a wall several feet thick. We should want tools and\nblasting-powder to get through it. No doubt it is a natural cave, and\nit seems to me probable that they altered the course of the stream\nabove, so that it should fall directly over the entrance. I think\nbefore we talk further about it we will go up there and take a look at\nit. If we find that the course has been changed that will settle the\nmatter.\"\n\nIt took them an hour to climb the hill and make their way down to the\ngorge through which the river ran. They examined it carefully.\n\n\"It must always have come along here,\" Dias said. \"There is no other\npossible channel; but there are marks of tools on the rocks on each\nside of the fall, and the water goes over so regularly that I think the\nrock must have been cut away at the bottom.\"\n\n\"It certainly looks like it, Dias. The rocks widen out too, so that\nhowever strong the rush of water may be it will always go over in a\nregular sheet. Let us follow it along a little way.\"\n\nFifty yards farther on, the gorge widened out suddenly, and they paused\nwith an exclamation of astonishment. Before them was a wide valley,\nfilled to the spot where they were standing with a placid sheet of\nwater four or five hundred yards wide, and extending to another gorge\nfully a mile away. Bertie was the first to find his voice.\n\n\"Here's a go! Who would have thought of finding a lake up in the hills\nhere?\"\n\n\"I did not know there was one,\" Dias said. \"I have never heard of it.\nBut that is not strange, for no one who came up the valley would dream\nthat there was anything beyond that fall.\"\n\nHarry had sat down and thought for some minutes, looking over the lake\nwithout speaking.\n\n\"I am afraid, Dias,\" he said at last, \"that your tradition was a true\none after all, and that the gold lay in the bed of a stream in the\nvalley we now see filled up.\"\n\n\"But it must always have been a lake, senor,\" Dias said after thinking\nfor a minute, \"and could not have been shallower, for there is no other\nescape than the waterfall; and however heavy the rains it could not\nhave risen higher, except a few feet, as one can see by the face of the\nrock.\"\n\n\"It may have had some other way out,\" Harry said.\n\nDias looked carefully round the side of the valley. \"There is no break\nin the hills that I can see, senor.\"\n\n\"No; but my firm conviction is that the top of that cave that we found\nbehind the fall is really the top of a natural tunnel through which the\nstream originally flowed. There are two or three reasons for this. In\nthe first place, it is certainly remarkable that there should be a cave\nimmediately behind that fall. I thought at first that the stream above\nmight have been diverted to hide it, but the ravine is so narrow that\nthat could not be possible. In the next place, your tradition has\nproved absolutely true in the matter of the star, and in the hour of\nits appearance in the exact line to the mouth of that cave. How\ncorrectly the details have been handed down from generation to\ngeneration! If they are right on that point it is hardly likely that\nthey can be inaccurate on other points, and that the tale of an\nextraordinarily rich treasure could have been converted into one of an\nexceptional deposit of gold in the bed of a river.\n\n\"I think that the passage was probably closed by the old people when\nthey were first threatened by the invasion of the Incas. No doubt they\nwould choose a season when the stream was almost dry. They had, as the\nremains of their vast buildings will show, an unlimited supply of\nlabour. They would first partially block up the tunnel, perhaps for the\nfirst fifty yards in, leaving only a small passage for the water to run\nthrough. They might then close the farther end with sacks of sand, and\nhaving the other stones all cut, and any number of hands, build it up\nbehind the sacks, and then go on with the work till it was solid; then\nno doubt they would heap stones and boulders against the face of the\nwall. By the time the Incas had conquered the country the valley would\nbe a lake many feet deep. The Incas, having gained an abundant supply\nof treasure elsewhere, would take no steps towards opening the tunnel,\nwhich in any case would have been a terrible business, for the pressure\nof water would drive everything before it. Having plenty of slave\nlabour at their disposal, they knew that it could be done at any time\nin case of great necessity, when the loss of the lives of those\nconcerned in it would be nothing to them. When the valley became full\nthe water began to pour out through this gap, which perhaps happened to\nbe immediately over the mouth of the tunnel, or it may have been\naltered by a few yards to suit, for they were, as we know from some of\ntheir buildings, such good workmen that they could fit slabs of the\nhardest stone so perfectly together that it is hardly possible to see\nthe joints. Therefore they would only have to widen the mouth of the\ngorge a little, and fit rocks in on either side so that they would seem\nto have been there for all time; and indeed the natural growth of ferns\nand mosses would soon hide the joints, even if they had been roughly\ndone.\"\n\n\"And that all means, Harry--?\" Bertie asked.\n\n\"That all means that we have no more chance of getting at the gold than\nif it were lying in the deepest soundings in the Pacific.\"\n\nBertie sat down with a gasp.\n\n\"There is no way of getting that water out,\" Harry went on quietly,\n\"except by either cutting a channel here as deep as the bottom of the\nlake, or by blasting the stone in the tunnel. The one would require\nyears of work, with two or three hundred experienced miners, and ten\ntimes as many labourers. The other would need twenty or thirty miners,\nand a hundred or two labourers. There is possibly another way; but as\nthat would require an immense iron siphon going down to the bottom of\nthe lake, along one side of this ravine, and down into the bottom of\nthe pool, with a powerful engine to exhaust the air in the first place\nand set it going, it is as impracticable, as far as we are concerned,\nas the other two.\n\n\"In the same way I have no doubt that, with a thousand-horse-power\nengine, the lake could be pumped dry in time; but to transport the\nplant for such an engine and its boiler across the mountains would be\nan enormous undertaking; and even were it here, and put up and going,\nthe difficulty of supplying it with fuel would be enormous. Certainly\none could not get up a company with capital enough to carry out any one\nof the schemes merely on the strength of an Indian tradition; and with\nthe uncertainty, even if they believed the tradition, whether the\namount of gold recovered would be sufficient to repay the cost incurred.\n\n\"Well, we may as well go down to dinner.\"\n\nHe shouldered his pick and led the way back. Scarce a word was spoken\non the way. Bertie tried to follow the example of his brother, and take\nthe matter coolly. Dias walked with his head down and the air of a\ncriminal going to execution. The disappointment to him was terrible. He\nhad all along felt so confident that they should be successful, and\nthat he should be enabled to enrich those he considered as the\npreservers of his life, that he was utterly broken down with the total\nfailure of his hopes.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nA FRESH START\n\n\nNot until he got to the camp did Harry look round. When he caught a\nglimpse of the guide's face he went up to him and held out his hand.\n\n\"You must not take it to heart, Dias; it has been unfortunate, but that\ncannot be helped. You have done everything you could in the matter, and\nbrought us to the right spot, and no one could tell that when we got\nwithin half a mile of the gold river we should find the valley turned\ninto a deep lake. We can only say, 'Better luck next time'. We would\nsay in England, 'There are as good fish in the sea as ever came out of\nit'. I have never felt very sanguine myself about this; it has all\nalong seemed too good to be true. Of course we are disappointed, but we\nmay have better luck next time.\"\n\n\"But I don't know, senor, with certainty of any other place. No one was\never entrusted with more than one secret, so that if the Spanish\ntortures wrung it out of him two treasures would not be lost.\"\n\n\"We need not talk any more about this place, Dias. I see your wife has\ngot some of the fish that we caught yesterday fizzling on the fire. Now\nI think of it, I am very hungry, for it is six hours since we had our\ncoffee this morning. After we have had our meal we can discuss what our\nnext move had better be.\"\n\nWhile they were speaking, Jose had been rapidly telling Maria the\nmisfortune which had befallen them, and the tears were running down the\nwoman's cheeks.\n\n\"You must not feel so badly about it, Maria,\" Harry said cheerfully;\n\"you see my brother and I are quite cheerful. At any rate, no one is to\nblame. It would have been an enormous piece of luck if we had\nsucceeded, but we never looked on it as a certainty. Anything might\nhave happened between the time the gold was shut up and now, though we\ncertainly never expected to find what we did. We only thought it\npossible that we might have the luck to find the treasure. Now you had\nbetter look to those fish, or we shall lose our breakfast as we have\nlost our gold, and this time by our own fault. We are as hungry as\nhunters all of us; and in fact we are hunters, although we have not\nbrought any game with us this time.\"\n\nThe woman wiped away her tears hastily, and, taking off the fish which\nshe had put on when they were coming down the hill, she laid them on\nplates with some freshly-baked cakes. The fish were excellent, and\nBertie, as they ate, made several jokes which set them all laughing, so\nthat the meal passed off cheerfully.\n\n\"Now for the great consoler,\" Harry said, as he took out his pipe.\n\"When we have all lighted up, the council shall begin. Never mind\nclearing away the plates now, Maria; just sit down with us, there is\nwisdom in many counsellors. Now, Dias, what do you think is the best\ncourse for us to adopt at present?\"\n\n\"Unless you wish to stay here and make further search?\"\n\n\"By no means, Dias,\" Harry said; \"for the present, I have seen enough\nof this side of the mountains. We will get back to Cuzco and make a\nfresh start from there.\"\n\n\"In that case, senor, there is no doubt as to the best route. There is\na pass over the mountains just on the other side of Mount Tinta; it\nleads to the town of Ayapata, which lies somewhere at the foot of that\npeak. I have never been there, but I know its situation. It is a very\nsteep pass, but as it is used for mule traffic it cannot be very bad.\nOnce we have passed over it on to the plateau we shall not be more than\nseventy or eighty miles from Cuzco.\"\n\n\"That is quite satisfactory. We will set off to-morrow.\"\n\n\"We had better catch some more fish, for we have had no time for\nhunting lately,\" Maria said. \"The meat we ate yesterday was the last we\nhad with us. If we cut the fish open and lay them flat on the rocks,\nwhich are so hot one can scarcely hold one's hand on them, they will be\nsufficiently dry by sunset to keep for two or three days, and before\nthat you are sure to shoot something.\"\n\nThe river was full of fish, and in half an hour they had caught an\nabundance, having fifteen averaging eight pounds apiece. These were at\nonce cut open, cleaned, and laid down to dry.\n\n\"The fishing on this river would let for a handsome sum in England,\"\nHarry laughed; \"and I think the fish are quite as good as trout of the\nsame size. The only objection is that they are so tame, and take the\nbait so greedily, that, good as the stream is, they would soon be\nexterminated.\"\n\nThat evening there was a slight stir among the animals which had just\nlain down. Jose leapt up and walked towards them.\n\n\"There is something the matter, Dias,\" he cried; \"the llamas are\nstanding up with their ears forward. They see or hear something.\"\n\n\"It may be pumas or jaguars,\" Dias said. \"Take your gun, senor.\"\n\nHe picked up his rifle, and Harry and Bertie followed suit, and further\narmed themselves with their shot-guns.\n\n\"You had best come with us, Maria,\" her husband said. \"There is no\nsaying where the beasts may be. See! the mules are standing up now and\npulling at their head-ropes. Let us go among them, senors, our presence\nwill pacify them.\"\n\nThey all moved towards the mules, which were standing huddled together.\nDias and Jose spoke to them and patted them.\n\n\"You stand at their heads, Maria,\" the former said, \"and keep on\ntalking to them. We must see if we can discover the beasts. There is\none of them!\" he exclaimed, but in a low tone. \"Do you see the two\nbright points of light? That is the reflection of the fire in his eyes.\"\n\n\"Shall I fire?\"\n\n\"No, senor, not yet. If we were only to wound him he would charge us;\nlet us wait till he gets closer. Probably there are two of them, male\nand female, they generally go about in pairs.\"\n\nEven as he spoke the seeming sparks disappeared.\n\n\"He has moved,\" Dias said; \"he will probably walk round us two or three\ntimes before he makes up his mind to attack.\"\n\n\"If he would go near the fire we could get a fair shot at him, Dias.\"\n\n\"He won't do that, senor; he will most likely go backwards and forwards\nin a semicircle, getting perhaps a little closer each time.\"\n\nTen minutes passed and then Maria said:\n\n\"There are two of them. I can see their outlines distinctly.\"\n\n\"Do you think, if we were to fire a gun, they would move off, Dias?\"\n\n\"They might for a time, senor, but the probability is that they would\ncome back again. They have smelt the mules, and are probably hungry. It\nis better to let them attack us at once and have done with it.\"\n\nA minute or two later there was a snarling growl.\n\n\"They are jaguars,\" Dias said.\n\nAgain and again the threatening sound was heard, and in spite of\nMaria's efforts the mules were almost mad with fright.\n\n\"We had better lie down beyond them,\" Dias said. \"There is no doubt the\nbeasts will come from that side. If we posted ourselves behind them the\nmules might break loose and knock us over just as we were taking aim.\"\n\nThey lay down side by side on the grass with their rifles at their\nshoulders.\n\n\"I can see them now, Dias,\" Harry whispered, \"not more than fifty yards\naway. I think we could hardly miss them now.\"\n\n\"You could not if it were daylight, senor; but in the dark, when you\ncan't see the end of your rifle, you can never be certain about\nshooting.\"\n\nThe beasts had now apparently made up their minds to attack. They\ncrouched low, almost dragging their bellies on the ground, and one was\nsomewhat in advance of the other.\n\n\"That is the male ahead,\" Dias whispered. \"Do you and your brother take\naim. I will take the female, and Jose will hold his fire of buck-shot\ntill she is within a length of us.\"\n\n\"How shall I know when it is going to spring?\"\n\n\"When it stops, senor. It is sure to stop before it springs.\"\n\n\"Aim between the eyes, Bertie, and fire when I do,\" Harry whispered to\nhis brother, who was lying next to him.\n\nWhen within twelve yards the jaguar halted.\n\n\"Now!\" Harry said, and they discharged their rifles at the same moment,\nand, dropping them, grasped the shot-guns.\n\nThe jaguar fell over on one side, clawing the air, and then recovered\nhimself. As he did so two charges of buck-shot struck him on the head,\nand he rolled over and remained motionless.\n\nDias had fired at the same moment, but he had not stopped the second\njaguar. Jose, instead of waiting, hastily discharged his gun, and in\nanother instant a dark body bounded over their heads on to the back of\none of the mules, which it struck to the ground.\n\nHarry and Bertie leapt to their feet, and discharged their second\nbarrels into the jaguar's body. It turned suddenly round and attempted\nto spring, but its hindquarters were paralysed; and Bertie, pulling out\nhis pistol, fired both barrels into its head. The brute at once fell\nover dead, and the lad gave a shout of triumph.\n\n\"Thank goodness that is over without accident!\" Harry said. \"They are\nformidable beasts, Dias.\"\n\n\"In the daytime, when one can see to aim, they can be killed easily\nenough, senor; at night their presence is to be dreaded.\"\n\n\"I am afraid we have lost a mule.\"\n\n\"I think not, senor. He was knocked down by the shock, but he had his\nsaddle on, and the brute had no time to carry him off.\"\n\nThe mule rose to its feet as they spoke; Jose ran and brought a flaming\nbrand from the fire. Blood was streaming from both the animal's\nshoulders.\n\n\"It stuck its claws in, senor, but has not made long gashes. I should\nsay that these wounds were caused by the contraction of the claws when\nyou finished her with your pistol. The animal will be all right in a\nday or two; and as our stores have diminished, we need not put any load\non it for a time.\"\n\n\"I hope you were not frightened, Maria?\" Bertie said\n\n\"I was a little frightened,\" she said, \"when the mule came tumbling\ndown close to me, and I could see the jaguar's eyes within a few yards\nof me, but I had my dagger ready.\"\n\n\"It would not have been much good,\" Dias said, \"if the beast had\nattacked you.\"\n\n\"I think you showed no end of pluck,\" Bertie said. \"If he had come\nclose to me, and I had got nothing but that little dagger in my hand, I\nshould have bolted like a shot.\"\n\n\"I am sure that you would not, senor,\" she said. \"You are a great deal\ntoo brave for that.\"\n\nBertie laughed.\n\n\"It is all very well to be brave with a rifle in your hand and another\ngun ready, to say nothing of the pistols. By the way, I thought Harry\nhad given you one of his?\n\n\"So he did, but I had forgotten all about it. If I had thought of it I\nshould have used it.\"\n\n\"It is just as well that you did not,\" Harry said. \"If you had done so,\nthe brute would have made for you instead of turning round to attack\nus.\"\n\n\"Now, senor,\" Dias put in, \"we had better drag the jaguars away; the\nmules will never get quiet with the bodies so close to them.\"\n\nIt needed all his strength and that of his companions to drag each of\nthe bodies fifty yards away.\n\n\"Now, Jose,\" Dias said when they returned, \"you had better give the\nanimals a feed of maize all round. They will settle down after that. I\nshall keep watch to-night, senor. It is not likely that any more of\nthese beasts are in the neighbourhood; but it is as well to be careful,\nand I don't think any of us would sleep if someone were not on the\nlook-out.\"\n\n\"I will relieve you at two o'clock,\" Harry said.\n\n\"No, senor, I have not been on the watch for the past two nights. I\nwould rather sit up by the fire to-night.\"\n\nTwo days later they arrived at the foot of the pass. Just as they\ngained it they met two muleteers coming down it. Dias entered into\nconversation with them, while the others erected tents, preparing to\ncamp.\n\n\"What is the news, Dias?\" Harry asked as he returned.\n\n\"The men say, senor, that the pass is very unsafe. Many robberies have\ntaken place in it, and several men, who endeavoured to defend\nthemselves against the brigands, have been killed. They were questioned\nby four armed men as they came down, and the goods they were carrying\ndown to Ayapata were taken from them. They say that traffic has almost\nceased on the road.\"\n\n\"That is bad, Dias.\"\n\n\"Very bad, senor. We need not be afraid of brigands if they meet us as\nwe travel along the foot of the hills, but it would be another thing in\nthe passes. There are many places where the mules would have to go in\nsingle file, and if we were caught in such a spot by men on the\nheights, we might be shot down without any chance of defending\nourselves successfully.\"\n\n\"That is awkward, Dias. It is a scandal that these brigands are not\nrooted out.\"\n\n\"People are thinking too much of fighting each other or their\nneighbours to care anything about the complaints of a few muleteers,\nsenor.\"\n\n\"Is there no other way of crossing the mountains than by this pass?\"\n\n\"There is a pass, senor, between Ayapata and Crucero, but it is a very\nbad one.\"\n\n\"And where should we be then, Dias?\"\n\n\"Well, senor, it would take us along the other side of the mountains to\nMacari. From that place there is an easy path to La Raya; there we are\non the plateau again, and have only to travel by the road through\nSicuani to Cuzco.\"\n\n\"In fact, it would double the length of our journey to Cuzco?\"\n\n\"Yes, senor; but if you liked, from Crucero you might go down to Lake\nTiticaca. There are certainly good mines in the mountains there.\"\n\n\"Yes, but is there any chance of our finding them?\"\n\n\"I can't say that, senor, but I fear that the chance would be very\nsmall.\"\n\n\"Then it is of no use trying, Dias. We saw at the last place what pains\nthe old people took to hide places where gold could be found, and if\nthere had been rich mines among these mountains you speak of, no doubt\nthey would have hidden them just as carefully. The question is, shall\nwe go up this pass as we intended, and take our chance, or shall we go\nby this roundabout way?\"\n\nBy this time Jose had lit a fire, and they had seated themselves by it.\n\n\"One hates turning back, but we are not pressed for time. As far as I\ncan see, my only chance is the feeble one of finding treasure in the\nplace you spoke of up the coast above Callao. It is now four months\nsince we left Lima. Travelling straight to that place would take us how\nlong?\"\n\n\"Well, senor, if we go round by Ayapata to Crucero, and then to Macari,\nit would be nearly a thousand miles.\"\n\n\"Quite a thousand, I should think. That is three months' steady work.\nBy the time we get there it will be about a year from the time we left\nEngland. I have seen quite enough of the mountains to know that our\nchance of finding anything among them is so small that it is not worth\nthinking of. It seems to me, therefore, Dias, that we might just as\nwell, instead of going south over these difficult passes, return by the\nfoot of the mountains as we have come, going through Paucartambo,\ncrossing the rivers that flow north and fall somewhere or other into\nthe Amazon, and keeping along it till we come to Cerro de Pasco. There\nwe should be nearly in a line with this place you know of, and can keep\ndue west--that is to say, as nearly due west as the mountains will\nallow. It would be three or four hundred miles shorter than by taking\nthe pass at Ayapata. We should have a good deal of sport by the way,\nand should certainly have no trouble with the brigands till we got to\nCerro. Of course it is possible that we might fall in with savages\nagain, but at any rate they are not so formidable as brigands in the\npasses. What do you say to that?\"\n\n\"It is certainly shorter, senor; and, as you say, we should have no\ntrouble with the brigands, and we should also escape the troubles that\nhave been going on for some years, and are likely, as far as anyone can\nsee, to go on for ever. We were very fortunate in not meeting any of\nthe armies that are always marching about.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nBRIGANDS\n\n\nThree months were spent in the journey to the foot of the pass leading\nup to Cerro. They had good shooting, and found no difficulty in\nproviding themselves with food. Fish were plentiful in the streams, and\nin some of the long-deserted plantations they found bananas, grapes,\nand other fruits in abundance, together with sugar-canes, tomatoes,\nmaize growing wild, and potatoes which were reverting to the wild type.\nThey met neither with alligators nor large serpents, for they kept on\nthe lower <DW72>s of the foot-hills, as much as possible avoiding the\nlow forest lands, where they might come in contact with the savages.\nFor the same reason, they had no opportunity of taking any of the great\nfish found in the sluggish rivers, but had an abundance of smaller fish\nin the bright mountain streams. They killed two tapirs and several\npumas and jaguars. Their two llamas, having one night wandered away\nfrom the mules, were killed by these beasts. But as the stores were a\ngood deal lighter than when they started, this was no great misfortune.\nOccasionally they followed streams up into the hills, and did a little\nwashing for gold when they halted for a day or two there.\n\n\"We have had a good time of it,\" Harry said as they sat round the fire,\n\"and I am almost sorry that it is over, and that this is our last day\nof wandering where we like, shooting and fishing, and above all,\ncamping in pleasant places. We have been very fortunate in not meeting\nany of the savages since the fight we had with them four or five months\nago. It is a splendid country for sport, and except that we should like\nit a bit cooler, and could have done without some of the\nthunder-storms, it is a grand life. For a time now we are going back to\na sort of civilization, filthy inns, swarms of fleas, and\nfifteenth-rate cooking.\"\n\n\"It is not so much the fault of the cooking,\" Maria said, \"as of the\nmeat. Here we get fish fresh out of the stream, and birds shot an hour\nor two before they are eaten. We pick our fruit from the trees, instead\nof buying it after it has been carried miles and miles to the market.\nWe have a capital stock of coffee, tea, and sugar. Among the old\nplantations we pick cocoa and pound it fresh, and boil it. As we\nbrought plenty of pepper and spices, it would be hard indeed if one\ncould not turn out a good meal. And then, senors, you always come to\neat it with a good appetite, which is all in favour of the cook.\"\n\n\"Yes, I grant that you have had all those advantages, Maria, but it is\nnot everybody who makes the best of them. I can safely say that since\nwe started we have never sat down to a bad breakfast or dinner. Now,\nfor a bit, we are going to lead a different sort of life. We shall be\non beaten tracks. We shall meet lots of people. It is strange to think\nthat, except for those peasant muleteers we met at the foot of the pass\nby the Tinta volcano, we have not seen a soul except the savages--who\nhave souls, I suppose--since we left Paucartambo more than six months\nago; and yet somehow we do not seem to have missed them. I wonder what\nwe shall find when we get up to Cerro, and who will be president then.\"\n\n\"I wonder what they are doing in Europe!\" Bertie said. \"We have heard\nno later news than what we had when we went on board a ship sixteen\nmonths ago. There may have been great wars all over Europe.\"\n\n\"I don't think there is much chance of that, Bertie. India was the only\nplace where there was any fighting going on, and it seemed as if, since\nNapoleon was crushed, Europe would become permanently pacific. Still, I\ndo hope that when we are at Lima we shall get hold of a pile of English\nnewspapers. The consul is sure to have them.\"\n\n\"I don't suppose we shall want to stay there many days, Harry, for we\nshall be eager to start the search for the enchanted castle Dias has\ntold us of. We saw quite enough of Lima during the ten days that we\nwere there.\"\n\n\"Is the pass a bad one up to Cerro, Dias?\"\n\n\"There are some very bad points, senor. It never was a good one, but as\nnothing has been done to the roads for at least a hundred years, it\nmust have got into a very bad state. I have been down it twice with\ntravellers, the second time ten years ago, and it was bad enough then.\nIt is likely to be worse now.\"\n\n\"Well, as the road is used so little, Dias,\" Harry said, \"there is no\nfear of brigands.\"\n\n\"I hope not, senor; but there may be some, though they would not be\nthere in the hope of plundering travellers. But desperate men are\nalways to be found in the mountains--men who have committed murders and\nfled from justice. They are able to live on what they can shoot, and of\ncourse they can get fish in the streams, and when they are tired of\nthat can come down here, where they will find plenty of turkeys, and\npheasants, and other game, besides the maize, and fruits, and other\nthings in the old plantations. Sometimes they will take a little\nplunder from the small villages. Anyhow, they do not fare altogether\nbadly. Therefore one can never feel certain that one is safe from them,\neven when travelling over tracks where travellers seldom pass. Still,\nwe may very well hope that we shall not have the bad luck to fall in\nwith them.\"\n\n\"I hope so, Dias. We did not come out here to fight. So far we have\nbeen very fortunate, and have not had to fire a shot, except at those\nwretched savages.\"\n\nThe next day's journey took them far up into the hills, and they camped\nthat night at the upper end of a deep ravine. It had been a hard day's\nwork, for at several points the mules had to be unloaded and taken up\nsingly, and the loads then carried up. Fortunately, the packs were now\nvery light, and were carried or hauled up without much difficulty.\n\nIn the morning they again started. They were just issuing from the\nravine when a party of ten armed men made their appearance from amongst\nsome rocks, and shouted to them to halt. Dias rode in front.\n\n\"You speak to them, Dias. Keep them for a minute in talk if you can,\nand then take shelter behind that boulder.\"\n\nThen Harry ran back to Jose, who was walking with a leading mule twenty\npaces behind.\n\n\"Turn them back again, Jose. Halt a little way down, and then come up;\nthere are some brigands ahead. Bertie, bring up your rifle and the two\nshot-guns. Tell Maria to remain with the mules.\"\n\nThen he ran back again just as a shot rang out, and, dodging among the\nfallen rocks, he took shelter behind one abreast with Dias. \"Was it you\nwho fired?\" he asked.\n\n\"No, one of the brigands. The ball went through the brim of my\nsombrero. I think they are talking to each other, they know there is no\nhurry.\"\n\n\"Hail them again, Dias, but don't show yourself above the rock.\"\n\n\"What do you want? Why did you fire at me?\"\n\n\"We want everything you have got,\" a voice came back--\"your mules and\ntheir burdens, and your arms. If you will give them up without\nresistance, we will let you up the pass without hindering you.\"\n\n\"Tell them that you must talk it over with the others, Dias.\"\n\n\"Well, we will give you five minutes,\" the man called back. \"If you do\nnot accept our terms, we will cut your throats.\"\n\nDias stood up, and walked quietly down the rugged pass. At the point\nwhere the mules stopped, the rock rose almost perpendicularly on each\nside.\n\n\"Maria,\" he said, \"do you and Jose take off the saddles and bags and\nfill up the spaces between these rocks on each side. Get the animals in\nbehind them. You stop with them, Maria. I have got five minutes, and\nwill help you.\"\n\n\"You had better go up at once, senor,\" he went on to Bertie, \"and help\nyour brother, so that they may not get sight of you. However, I am\nafraid they know how many we are. It was foolish to light that fire\nyesterday evening, I expect they were somewhere near and caught sight\nof us, and no doubt one of them crept quietly down to find out what our\nforce was. Seeing there were but four of us, they thought they could\ntake us all easily here in the morning without firing a shot. But as\nyour brother and I happened to be going on first, they thought they\nwould parley. They would be sure that if they attacked us, we should\nkill two or three of them at least before we had finished with them.\nAnd as they reckoned that we should gladly accept their terms, they\nwould get all they wanted without trouble, and could shoot us\nafterwards if they felt inclined.\"\n\nBertie had by this time got the guns unstrapped, and had filled his\npockets with cartridges. He now went forward, and as he kept among the\nrocks he was able to get within four or five yards of his brother\nwithout being seen, as the mouth of the pass was almost blocked with\ngreat boulders.\n\n\"I cannot get any nearer without running the risk of being seen. I have\nloaded the double-barrelled guns.\"\n\n\"Stay where you are then, Bertie. I don't think they will make a rush,\nand if they do, you can use them as well as your rifle. Of course I\nhave my pistols and you have yours. I don't believe they will venture\nto attack in daylight, our trouble will be after dark.\"\n\n\"Now, then, the five minutes are up!\" the brigand shouted.\n\n\"I am coming!\" Dias shouted back.\n\nAs he approached, Harry said: \"Stand by the side of a rock, Dias, so as\nto be able to shelter as soon as you have given them the answer; they\nare likely enough to fire a volley.\"\n\n\"We will give you nothing,\" Dias shouted. \"Anything you want you had\nbetter come and take.\"\n\nThree men raised their heads above the rocks and fired. Almost at the\nsame instant Harry's rifle and Bertie's cracked out, the heads\ndisappeared, and a fierce yell of rage showed that one, if not both of\nthe shots had found their mark.\n\n\"You had better clear off,\" Harry shouted. \"There are four of us, and\nwe have eight barrels between us, to say nothing of two brace of\npistols.\"\n\nA volley of curses was hurled back in reply.\n\n\"Now, Dias, what do you think is our best move?\"\n\n\"I don't know, senor. I fancy there are only eight of them now. You and\nyour brother could hardly miss marks like their heads at thirty paces.\"\n\"If I were quite sure that there are no more of them I should say that,\nas soon as it becomes dark, we had better creep forward and fight them.\nIt would be better to do that than wait for them to attack us. But\nthere may be, and very likely are, more of these bands among the hills.\nBesides, Dias, we don't want to lose one of our number, and we could\nhardly hope to get through unscathed, for if we were to try to push on\nthey would have us at a tremendous advantage. They would hide among the\nrocks and shoot us down before we had time to level a gun at them. Now\nthat we have killed one, if not two of their number, they will\ncertainly try to get their revenge, and will harass us all the way up\nthe pass.\"\n\n\"It is not only that, senor; it is the booty they expect to take.\"\n\n\"They could not expect much booty,\" Harry said, \"for our baggage\nanimals only carry small loads.\"\n\n\"Gold does not take up a large bulk, senor; and I have not the least\ndoubt that they believe we have been gold-hunting, and have probably a\nbig amount of gold dust among the baggage.\"\n\n\"I did not think of that, Dias. If they believe we have gold we will\ntake it as granted that they will do their best to get it. Well, do you\nthink it would be a good thing to make a rush?\"\n\n\"No, senor, it would be throwing away our lives. They will guess that\nwe shall probably attempt such a thing, and I have no doubt that they\nwill move away, if they haven't done so already, and hide themselves\namong other rocks. Then if we dashed forward to the place where they\nhad been, they would pour a volley into us and finish us at once; for\nif they were lying twenty yards away they ought certainly to hit every\none of us, as they have eight shots to fire. At present I have no doubt\nthey are talking, and I think we can safely get back to where we piled\nup the saddles and bales. We can defend ourselves better there than\nhere. We can then talk matters over quietly.\"\n\n\"That will be the best plan, Dias, certainly.\"\n\nKeeping under cover as well as they could they retired to the\nbarricade, thirty yards lower. Jose, aided by Maria, had completed the\ndefence. They had not, however, attempted to block the passage between\ntwo great rocks. It was but three feet wide; the rocks lay about six\nfeet from the cliffs on either side, and these spaces were partly\nfilled by smaller fragments. Wherever there were open spaces the\nblankets had been thrust in from behind. Dias had done the greater part\nof the work before he went up to answer the demands of the bandits, but\nthe others had laboured very hard to finish it.\n\n\"Well done!\" Harry said as they passed through the entrance.\n\n\"I told them not to close the path,\" Dias said. \"We can do that now we\nare all together. Most of the rocks are too heavy for Jose and Maria to\nlift. Shall we build it up now, senor? I am sure they cannot force\ntheir way through while we four are holding the barricade.\"\n\n\"Certainly not, Dias, and I have no fear of their attempting it. But I\nthink it would be as well for us to close it, otherwise we could not\ncross from one side to the other without exposing ourselves.\"\n\nIt took them two hours' hard work--the harder because the stones had to\nbe thrown into the passage from the sides, as the brigands might be\ncrouching among the rocks higher up waiting for an opportunity to get a\nshot. At the end of the two hours the gap was filled up to the height\nof six feet.\n\n\"Now we can talk matters over quietly, Dias,\" Harry said. \"We may take\nit that, whether they attack by day or by night, we can beat them off.\nThere is a little rill of water that trickles down along the centre, so\nwe need not fear being driven out by thirst, and we have food enough to\nlast us a fortnight. That is settled; but they may stay there for any\ntime, and without exposing ourselves to sudden death we cannot find out\nwhether they are still hanging about or not. Of course one very\nimportant question is, are they going to be joined by others?\"\n\n\"I think they certainly will be, senor. As many of these fellows are\nhiding among the hills as would make a good-sized regiment, and they\nhave only to send off two or three of their number with the news that a\nparty of gold-diggers with five laden mules are shut up in this ravine\nto gather any number of them. They would come as quickly as vultures to\na dead horse. It must be a long time since they had any really valuable\nplunder, and the fact that we have five baggage mules besides the three\nriding ones would show that we had probably been a very long time away,\nand might therefore possess a lot of gold.\"\n\n\"Are there any other passes near?\"\n\n\"The nearest, senor, is on the other branch of the Palcazu--the river\nwe followed till we entered the passes--and is about thirty miles to\nthe north. The pass starts from a spot about fifteen miles above the\njunction, and goes up to Huaca, a place that is little more than ten\nmiles south of Huanuco. From Huaca we could either follow the road to\nCerro, or strike across the Western Cordilleras to Aguamiro.\"\n\n\"Then I think, Dias, that our best plan will be to go down again into\nthe valley we left yesterday morning, and then strike across for the\nmouth of this pass you speak of. You know the direction?\"\n\n\"I know the general direction, although I have never been along there.\"\n\n\"Well, Dias, you must be the guide. I should say the sooner we start\nthe better. My idea is this: If you with your wife and Jose will start\nat once, so as to be down the pass before it gets dark, my brother and\nI will remain here. You will leave our riding mules at the point where\nthe track is good enough for us to gallop on.\"\n\n\"We should not like to leave you, senor,\" Maria said.\n\n\"I have not the least fear of their attacking us, and with our rifles\nand double-barrelled guns and pistols we could beat them off if they\ndid. I can't see any better way of getting out of this scrape, and am\nquite willing to adopt this plan.\"\n\n\"I don't see any other way, senor,\" Dias said. \"The plan is a good one;\nbut I wish I could stay here with you.\"\n\n\"But that would be impossible, Dias, for there would be no chance of\nour finding the mouth of this pass by ourselves.\"\n\n\"Why could we not all go together?\" Maria asked.\n\n\"Because if there were no one here the brigands might discover that we\nhad gone, within an hour or so of our starting. They might fire a shot\nor two, and, finding that we did not answer, crawl gradually down till\nthey got here, for it must seem possible to them that we should return\ndown the pass; and as there is no getting the baggage mules to go fast,\nwe might very well be overtaken--I don't mean by those eight men, but\nby a considerable number.\"\n\n\"But how are you to find your way, senor?\" Dias said.\n\n\"We shall follow the valley down till we come to the spot where you\nhave struck off. You can fasten a white handkerchief to a stick and put\nit in some bare place where we are sure to see it. I want you to halt\nwhen you get to the river somewhere opposite the mouth of the pass. We\nwill ride nearly due north, and when we strike the river will follow it\ndown till we reach you.\"\n\n\"We can't halt opposite the mouth of the pass, for the river there is\nalready some size, and we could not cross it. I shall keep along near\nthe foot of the hills--the water there is shallow enough to ford. Then\nI will follow it down until, as you say, near the entrance to the pass,\nand there stop on the bank till you come.\"\n\n\"That will do very well. In that case it won't matter much where we\nstrike the stream, as our mules can swim across easily enough--they\nhave had plenty of practice during the past six months. However, we\nwill turn off north where we can see your signal.\"\n\n\"When will you leave, senor?\"\n\n\"To-morrow morning. I have no fear of their attacking during the night,\nfor they can hardly bring other bands down here before morning. As soon\nas it gets dark we will light two torches and put them down at the foot\nof the barricade, so that we shall be in the shadow. These will show\nthem that we are still here, and they won't care to venture down into\nthe circle of light. We have let them know what a formidable amount of\nfirearms we have, and have given them a lesson that we can shoot\nstraight.\"\n\n\"They certainly would not come, senor, as long as your torches are\nburning, but three hours are as much as you can reckon upon their\nburning.\"\n\n\"Well, we have a dozen left now, Dias, and when they burn out we must\nlight two more and throw them over and trust to their burning as they\nlie among the stones. Of course we should not think of going down to\nstick them upright, for the scoundrels will probably be watching us as\nclosely as we are watching them. However, I shall manage to keep the\nlights going till daybreak, and shall start a good hour before that. We\nshall have to go down cautiously, and I should like to be well away\nwith the mules before they discover that we have left. Now, the sooner\nyou are off the better. Breakfast has been ready for the past hour. You\nhad better eat it and get under weigh as soon as you can. After you\nhave gone one of us will keep watch while the other eats. I have no\ndoubt there will be plenty left for our supper.\"\n\n\"Yes, senor, and enough cakes to carry you on till you join us.\"\n\nHalf an hour later the party started, Dias having muffled the mules'\nhoofs, so that the clatter, as they passed over the rocks, might not be\nheard above.\n\n\"Now, Bertie, you go down to breakfast. When you have done come up and\nrelieve me. You have no occasion to hurry, for it is absolutely certain\nthat they won't dare to attack till they get reinforcements.\"\n\nWhen Bertie returned he said, \"Here is a lot of food, Harry, they have\nhardly eaten anything. There is plenty for us to-day and to-morrow.\"\n\n\"That is just like them, Bertie; but I daresay they will camp in five\nor six hours. It feels quite lonely without them.\"\n\n\"That it does. It is really the first time we have been alone since we\nleft Lima, except, of course, when we were out shooting together.\"\n\n\"Be sure you don't show your head above the barricade, Bertie. You must\ndo as I have been doing, sit down here and look out through this\npeep-hole between these rocks Shove your rifle through it, so that, if\nyou see a head looking out from between the rocks up there, you can\nfire at once.\"\n\nIn half an hour Harry came back and sat down by his brother, and,\nlighting their pipes, they chatted over the events of their journey and\nthe prospect before them.\n\n\"I am afraid, Harry, the journey will be a failure, except that we have\nhad a very jolly time.\"\n\n\"Well, so far it has not turned out much; but, somehow or other, I have\ngreat faith in this haunted castle. Of course the demons Dias is so\nafraid of are probably Indians, who are placed there to frighten\nintruders away, and they would not keep watch unless they had something\nto guard. I cannot understand how it has escaped the notice of the\nSpaniards all these years. I had not much faith in their stories until\nwe found how true they were in all particulars as to what they call the\ngolden river. There is one satisfaction, however: if the place is\nreally a castle, it can hardly have disappeared under the lake. Of\ncourse if it is in ruins we may have a lot of difficulty in getting at\nthe vaults, or wherever else treasure may have been buried; but unless\nit is a very big place, which is hardly probable, the work would be\nnothing compared with the draining of the lake.\"\n\n\"We have got nearly a year in hand, Harry, and can do a lot of work in\nthat time, especially if we use powder.\"\n\n\"Yes; but, you see, we ought to allow at least five months for getting\nhome. Still, no doubt if I felt justified in writing to ask for another\nthree or four months, saying I had great hopes of finding something\nvery good in a short time, she would stand out against her father a\nlittle longer. I shall write directly we get to Lima to say that,\nalthough I have so far failed, I do not give up hope, and am just\nstarting on another enterprise that promises well.\"  Bertie held up his\nfinger. \"I think I heard somebody move. It sounded like a stone being\nturned over.\" For two or three minutes he lay motionless, with his\nfinger on the trigger. Then he fired.\n\n\"What was it, Bertie?\"\n\n\"It was a man's leg. I suddenly saw it below that rift behind the rock.\nI expect he had no idea that his foot showed there. I am pretty sure I\nhit it, for I had time to take a steady aim, and the foot disappeared\nthe instant I fired. If he did not know it was exposed, there was no\nreason why he should have moved at all if he hadn't been hit.\"\n\n\"It was better to hit his foot than his head, Bertie. It is equally\ngood as a lesson, if not better, for though we don't mean to let them\nkill us, I don't want to take life unless it is absolutely necessary.\nWell, after that proof of the sharpness of our watch they are not\nlikely to make any fresh move.\"\n\nThe day passed slowly. They took it by turns to keep watch, and just\nbefore dusk Harry said, \"I think, Bertie, that we might pull out the\nleaves and bush that Dias shoved into one of these gaps when he took\nthe blankets and things out. I could push the torch through and fix it\nthere, that would save having to cross the barricade. It is quite\npossible that one of those fellows may be keeping as sharp a look-out\nas we are doing, and it is as well not to set one's self up as a mark.\nIf I put it through now it won't show much, while if I wait till\ndarkness falls it will be an easy object to fire at. You keep a sharp\nlookout while I am doing this, and if you see either a head or a gun\ntry to hit it.\"\n\nHarry accomplished the operation without drawing a shot, and as soon as\nhe had fixed the torch he again stopped the hole up behind it.\n\n\"It is evident that they are not watching us very closely,\" he said.\n\"If they have not sent for help, they have gone off. With two of their\nmen killed and two disabled, the fight must have been taken out of\nthem. We will watch by turns to-night. It is six o'clock now; will you\nsit up till eleven, or shall I?\"\n\n\"I don't care a bit. Which would you rather take?\"\n\n\"I don't care;--however, I may as well take the first watch. We will\nstart at five, so rouse me at four. If they come at all, which is\npossible, but not probable, it will be between four and five.\"\n\nAt ten o'clock Harry could see a glow of light at some distance from\nthe mouth of the ravine, and in the stillness could occasionally catch\nthe sound of voices. When he woke Bertie at twelve the lad looked at\nhis watch and said, \"You are an hour late in calling me, Harry.\"\n\n\"Yes, I had no inclination for sleep. The fellows have been reinforced.\nOf course I don't know to what extent, but I should say pretty\nstrongly. They have lit a big fire some distance from the ravine. They\nwould not have dared to light one if they had not felt themselves\nstrong enough to fight us. No doubt they have half a dozen men on watch\nwhere we first saw them, and these would give notice if we were coming.\nI think we may as well fire a couple of shots, it will show them that\nwe are here and on guard. They will suppose we thought we heard someone\ncoming down to reconnoitre our position.\"\n\nThey both fired over the top of the barricade.\n\n\"I see you have renewed the torch, Harry,\" Bertie said as they reloaded.\n\n\"Yes, I have done so twice. I was very careful, however, as I feared\nthey might be watching. I did not wait for the lighted one to burn out,\nbut passed the other one out, putting the end of my poncho round my\nhand and arm, so that they could hardly be noticed even by anyone\nwithin ten yards, and certainly could not be seen from up there. As I\npushed it through I lighted it at the stump of the old torch and then\nwithdrew my hand like a shot. I did the same thing again an hour ago\nwith equal success, so it is evident that they are not keeping a very\nsharp look-out above, and have no fear of our making a sortie, hampered\nas we are by our animals.\"\n\nThe torch was changed again at four o'clock, and a little later Bertie\nheard a slight noise.\n\n\"I think they are coming, Harry,\" he said quietly.\n\nHarry was at once on his feet. \"Use your rifle first, Bertie, and sling\nit over your shoulder before you give them the two barrels of\nbuck-shot, so that you can start to run at once if we don't stop them.\"\n\n\"Yes, I am certain they are coming,\" he said, after listening for two\nor three minutes. \"We have got two or three torches left, and I will\ngive them the benefit of them.\"\n\nHe went back to the embers of the fire, lighted the torches, and,\nreturning to the barrier, threw them twenty or thirty yards up the\nravine. There was a hoarse shout of anger, and then a dozen shots were\nfired. Bertie's rifle cracked out in return, and Harry's followed\nalmost immediately. A dark group of some twenty or thirty men were\nrushing forward, and had just reached the line where the torches were\nburning, when four barrels of buck-shot were poured into them. Three or\nfour fell, the rest fled at once, and the cries and oaths showed that\nmany of them were wounded.\n\n\"They won't venture again for the present,\" Harry said. \"You may be\nsure they will hold a council of war, so load again and then we will be\noff.\"\n\nTwo minutes later they were making their way carefully down the rocky\npassage, Harry carrying the bundle they had made up of the unconsumed\nprovisions. As they had to exercise great care in climbing over the\nrocks, the day was just breaking when they came upon two mules that had\nbeen left behind for them. They rode cautiously until they were quite\nout of the ravine, and then started down the valley at a gallop. In an\nhour Bertie exclaimed, \"There is the flag!\" They rode to it and then\nturned off to the north, slackening their pace to a trot. The animals\nwere in good condition, as they had of late been making short marches,\nand at eleven o'clock they came upon the river. Here they waited for an\nhour, gave a couple of cakes to each animal, and ate the rest\nthemselves. The river was some fifty yards across, but the mules only\nneeded to swim about half this distance. The brothers kept beside them,\nplacing one elbow on the saddles and holding their rifles and\nammunition well above the water. They were soon across, and, mounting,\nfollowed the river down, letting the animals go their own pace, and\nsometimes walking beside them, as they wished to keep them fresh for\nthe next day's work. At five in the afternoon they saw smoke ahead of\nthem, and, riding faster now, soon joined their companions, who hailed\ntheir arrival with shouts of joy.\n\n\"We have been terribly anxious about you, senors,\" Dias said, \"and\nregretted deeply that we deserted you.\"\n\n\"It was not desertion, Dias; you were obeying orders, and were on duty\nguarding the baggage. There was really no cause for uneasiness; we were\ncertain that we could beat them off if they ventured to attack us.\"\n\n\"And did they do so?\"\n\n\"They made a feeble attack this morning at four o'clock, but we were\nready for them. They might have carried the barricade had we only had\nour rifles, but buck-shot was too much for them. Of course we brought\ndown two with our rifles; but there must have been over a score of\nthem, and the four barrels of buck-shot did heavy execution. Some of\nthem fell, and I fancy most of the others got a dose of shot, as they\nwere all in a close body. I will tell you all about it after we have\nhad supper.\"\n\n\"I have got it ready,\" Maria said. \"We have been expecting you for the\npast hour, and I was sure you would have good appetites when you\narrived.\"\n\nAfter the story had been told Dias said: \"That was a capital plan of\nkeeping the torches burning all night, and especially of throwing two\nof them up the ravine when you heard the fellows coming. Of course they\ncalculated on getting within fifteen yards or so before you saw them.\nWell, there is no fear of our hearing any more of them. I expect you\nmust have been gone hours before they found out that you had left.\"\n\n\"I should not be surprised if, after they had recovered from their\ndefeat, half of them made a big circuit over the hills--no doubt they\nknow every foot of them--and, coming down at the bottom of the ravine,\nbuilt a strong barricade, making up their minds to guard both ends\nuntil we were obliged to surrender from want of food. Having suffered\nso heavily, they would do everything in their power to prevent any of\nus from getting out alive.\"\n\n\"In that case they must have been prepared to wait for some time, Dias,\nfor they knew we had eight animals to eat.\"\n\n\"They would not have lasted long, senor, for we have only a few\nhandfuls of grain left, and there is not enough forage in the ravine to\nlast them a couple of days.\"\n\n\"I expect they would have tried to get us to surrender, by offering to\nlet us pass if we would give them half of the gold they thought we had\nwith us. There is no chance of our being followed, I suppose, Dias?\"\n\n\"Not the slightest. When at last they discover that we have gone, they\nwill come down the pass and find where the mules were left standing.\nThey will then see that only two of us had remained at the barricade,\nand will guess at once that the rest left hours before. They will\ntherefore conclude that, being on foot, they have no chance of\novertaking us, even if they could find the track.\"\n\n\"No, I expect by this time they are dancing with rage, and as likely as\nnot quarrelling furiously among themselves. How far do you think we\nhave ridden to-day?\"\n\n\"Nearer sixty miles than fifty, senor.\"\n\n\"Yes, I suppose we have. And if we had come straight here?\"\n\n\"It would have been nearly fifteen miles shorter. But if they pursued\nthey would not come that way, because they would not be able to get\nacross. I think they would have to go round and ford the river some\nmiles higher than you did. They could never swim across with their guns\nand ammunition to carry.\"\n\n\"I should not count on that, Dias. They might come straight here, as\nthey would guess that we had made for this pass, and they might make\nbundles of reeds to carry their guns and ammunition across, and swim\nover.\"\n\n\"That would be possible,\" Dias admitted reluctantly, \"and if they knew\nthat the five mules were all loaded with gold they might be tempted to\nfollow; but that they could only guess. I have no doubt, too, that many\nof them had been walking for hours across the mountains before the\nattack, and as you fired into the thick of them, a fair share must have\nbeen too much wounded to start on a forty-miles' tramp.\n\n\"No, senor. I do not think there is any chance whatever of their\npursuing us. Besides, I chose a spot where the ground was hard and\nrocky to plant that flag. And they would have a good deal of difficulty\nin ascertaining in what direction we went from there.\"\n\n\"We pulled up the flag-staff and threw it away among the bushes a mile\nand a half farther, and of course brought the handkerchief with us.\"\n\n\"I don't think we need give another thought to them, senor. At the same\ntime, it would be as well to keep one on watch all night. Jose and I\nwill be on guard by turns. Neither of you slept a wink last night, so\nyou must not keep watch this time.\"\n\n\"I sha'n't be sorry for a good sleep, for the meal we have eaten has\nmade me drowsy. However, if you hear the least noise, wake us at once.\"\n\n\"That I will do, senor. It is a great deal more likely to be made by a\nwild beast than by a brigand.\"\n\nThe brothers were sound asleep in a few minutes, and did not wake till\nDias called them, and said that Maria had coffee ready.\n\n\"What sort of a pass is it to-day, Dias?\"\n\n\"Not a very bad one, senor. The one we tried yesterday hadn't been used\nfor very many years, there is regular traffic up and down this; not\nvaluable traffic, for Pozuco is a small place. They send up fruit and\ndried fish, and the oil they get from the fish; and bring back cloth,\nand such things as are required in the village.\"\n\n\"So there is nothing to tempt brigands to infest the pass and rob\ntravellers!\"\n\n\"No, senor. When I last went through it I heard no talk of them at all.\nThey are more likely to infest the hills beyond Cerro, for near that\nplace really valuable captures can be made.\"\n\n\"That accounts for their being able to gather so many men to attack us.\"\n\nThe journey up the pass occupied two days. They met three or four small\nparties of men with donkeys or mules, but all these when questioned\nsaid that the pass was perfectly open, and that it was a very rare\nthing indeed for anyone to be robbed on the way. Late in the evening of\nthe second day they arrived at Huaca, and were advised to go to the\npriest's house, as the accommodation at the inn was so bad. The man who\ndirected them there was the head man of the place, and they gladly\naccepted his offer to guide them to the priest's house.\n\n\"It would be the best way, senor,\" Dias said. \"I know a man here who\nwould willingly put us up, and who has a yard where the mules could\npass the night.\"\n\n\"Very well, Dias. Be sure you buy a good stock of grain. They have\nscarce had any for the last three days.\"\n\nThe priest--a cheery, hearty man--received Harry and Bertie cordially\nwhen they were introduced as English travellers, especially when he\nfound that they could both speak Spanish fluently.\n\n\"It is a pleasure to receive British travellers,\" he said. \"Cochrane\nand Miller have done more for us than any of our own countrymen. It is\nnot often that travellers come this way. I have heard of two or three\ngoing to Cuzco, but they never come farther north than Cerro. I shall\nbe delighted if you will stay two or three days here, senors. We get so\nlittle news of the world that it would be a great pleasure to us to\nhear what is going on outside this unfortunate country.\"\n\n\"We can give you but little news, for it is more than a year since we\nleft England, and we have heard nothing of what is doing in Europe, as\nwe have been travelling and shooting at the foot of the mountains\nbetween the bottom of this pass and Tinta volcano.\"\n\n\"And gold seeking?\" the priest asked with a twinkle in his eye.\n\n\"We have occasionally washed the sands in the streams, but have not\nfound enough to repay our work. The amount we have gathered is only\nabout twenty ounces.\"\n\n\"Well, gentlemen, I shall be delighted to have you as my guests as long\nas you are willing to stay.\"\n\n\"We are greatly obliged to you,\" Harry said, \"and will gladly be your\nguests. To-morrow the animals need a rest, and we shall enjoy one too.\nNext morning we must be going on, as we have been away longer than we\nought, and want to get down to Lima quickly.\"\n\nThey had great difficulty in getting away from Huaca, where the good\npriest made them extremely comfortable, and was very loath to let them\ngo. However, at dawn on the second day they started for Cerro, and\narrived there forty-eight hours later after a rough journey through the\nMils.\n\n\"We never know in Peru, when we go to bed, who will be president when\nwe wake,\" Dias said that evening. \"There have been a dozen of them in\nthe past five years. Lamar, Gamarra, La Fuente, Orbegozo, Bermudes, and\nSalaverry succeeded one another; then Santa Cruz became master. Nieto\nhad the upper hand for a bit, and at that time there was no travelling\non the roads, they were so infested by robbers; one band was master of\nLima for some time. Then the Chilians occupied Lima; Santa Cruz was\ndefeated, and Gamarra came in again. None of these men was ever supreme\nover the whole country. Generals mutinied with the troops under them,\nother leaders sprang up, and altogether there has been trouble and\ncivil war ever since the Spaniards left. That is why the country is so\nfull of robbers. When an army was defeated, those who escaped took to\nthe hills and lived by plunder until some other chief revolted, then\nthey would go down and join him; and so it has gone on.\"\n\n\"Who composed those armies? because the fields seem to have been well\ncultivated, and the peasants are quiet enough.\"\n\n\"Yes, senor, for the most part they take no part in these affairs. The\nmen who compose the armies were in the first place the remains of those\nwho fought against the Spaniards. When the Spaniards left the country\nthese men had nothing to do, and were ready to enlist under anyone who\nraised a flag and promised them pay. Of bourse there are many men in\nthe towns who are too lazy to work, and who help to keep up the supply\nof armed men. The good God only knows when these things will come to an\nend. A few of those who have come into power really loved their\ncountry, and hoped to establish order and do away with all the abuses\ncaused by the men who were appointed to offices by one or another of\nthose tyrants; but most of them were ambitious soldiers, who led\nmutineers against the chief of the moment. If Heaven would but destroy\nor strike with blindness the soldiers--and above all, every official in\nPeru--the country might hope for peace and good government. The best\nman who has ever fought out here since Lord Cochrane left the place was\nGeneral Miller, your countryman, who was splendidly brave. He was\nalways true to his word, never allowed his soldiers to plunder, and\nnever ill-treated those captured in battle. Ah! they should have made\nhim president, but it would never have done. As the Chilians were\njealous of Lord Cochrane, the Peruvians were jealous of Miller, first\nbecause he was a foreigner, secondly because his uprightness and\nfidelity were a reproach to their ambition and treachery, their greed,\nand their cruelty. Besides, he understood them too well, and if all\nPeru had asked him to be president, he knew well enough that\nconspiracies against him would begin the next morning. Ah, he was a\ngreat man!\n\n\"Well, senor, I think that before we start it will be well that I at\nleast should go on to Ayapata and find out what is doing. That would\nonly delay us two days, and we might be better able to judge as to\nwhich route to take. They may be fighting in the north, and we do not\nwant to get mixed up in any way in their quarrels.\"\n\n\"I think that would be a very good plan, Dias. You start in the\nmorning, and we will stay quietly here till you come back with the\nnews. If many brigands are in the pass they might get to hear of us\nfrom someone going over from this side, and take it into their heads to\ncome down. I would certainly rather not have to fight with you away.\"\n\nAccordingly next morning Dias went on ahead. On the following evening\nhe rejoined them.\n\n\"There is fresh trouble in the south, senor. Colonel Vivancohidas has\ndeclared himself Regenerator of Peru, and is now marching against\nGamarra, and General Castilla is advancing against him. The fighting\nwill be somewhere near Arequipa. Whichever wins will presently cross\nthe mountains and make for Cuzco.\"\n\n\"Then that settles it, Dias. Certainly I have heard nothing in\nGamarra's favour, but a great deal against him, since I landed, and I\ncare nothing about either side; but I hope the new man will win,\nbecause I think that any change from Gamarra will be an improvement.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nPRISONERS\n\n\nWhen they arrived at Cerro de Pasco they found that the division of\nGamarra's army stationed in the district had mutinied and had declared\nfor Vivancohidas, and were killing all those known as adherents of\nGamarra. All traffic was at a stand-still. Numbers of the soldiers who\ndid not choose to join in the mutiny had taken to the hills, and were\npillaging convoys and peaceful travellers alike.\n\n\"I think, senor,\" Dias said, \"that instead of crossing the Cordilleras\nto the west, as we had intended, it will be better for us to go south,\nskirt the lake of Junin, and make for Oroya. That is the route\ngenerally taken, for the passes west are terribly difficult. I have\ntraversed this route many times, and when going with merchandise I\nalways go through Oroya, though in returning from Cerro I take the\nshorter route.\"\n\n\"Very well, Dias, you are the best judge of that. It is a great\nnuisance that this rising should have taken place just as we want to\ntraverse the country, but it can't be helped. I will go to the\nhead-quarters of Quinda--he is established at the mayor's house\nhere--and get a pass from him.\n\n\"It would be well, perhaps, if you were to go with me, Dias, to confirm\nmy statement that we have been shooting and hunting. I hope he will\ngive us a pass, so that we shall not be interfered with by his men\ngathered at different points on the road to Oroya. I hear that a\nconsiderable portion of his force have already marched forward.\"\n\nThe Peruvian colonel questioned Harry closely as to his motives for\ntravelling there.\n\n\"I suppose,\" he said, \"you have been searching for gold. We are sorely\nin need of funds, and I shall feel myself obliged to borrow any gold\nthat you may have collected for the use of my army, giving you an order\non the treasury at Lima, which will, of course, be honoured as soon as\nthe authority of President Vivancohidas is established.\"\n\n\"I do not doubt the goodness of the security,\" Harry said quietly,\n\"although possibly I might have to wait some time before the order was\ncashed; but while hunting I have not come upon any treasure. We have\noccasionally, when halting at streams, amused ourselves by doing a\nlittle gold-washing, but when I tell you that during the eight months\nsince we started from Cuzco we have only collected about twenty ounces\nof gold, you may well suppose that no good fortune has attended us.\"\n\n\"Is that all, senor?\"\n\n\"I give you my word of honour that is all, senor; and as I shall have\nto lay in a store of provisions and so on for my journey down to Lima,\nyou may well imagine that it would be a serious inconvenience to me to\npart with it.\"\n\n\"Quite so, senor; so small a sum as that would not go far among the\nfour thousand men under my command. However, I shall have pleasure in\ngiving you the pass that you ask. You have had good sport, I hope?\"\n\n\"As good as I expected. We kept ourselves in food, and have seen a\nsplendid country, which I hope some time will again be cultivated, and\nadd to the wealth of your country.\"\n\nAfter a further exchange of compliments Harry returned to the inn where\nthey had put up.\n\nNext morning, after purchasing some coffee and other stores that were\nneeded, they set out.\n\n\"Now we are all right, Dias,\" Harry said as they started.\n\n\"I hope so, senor; but from what I heard yesterday evening several\nstrong bands of disaffected soldiers are in the hills between this and\nOroya. Quinda's troops have by no means all joined him, and several\ncompanies that broke off have stationed themselves in the hills along\nthis road. They have stopped and robbed more than one mule train with\nsilver from the mines there. They have not meddled, as far as I hear,\nwith Quinda's troops, but have simply seized the opportunity of\nperpetrating brigandage on a large scale.\"\n\n\"Well, we must take our chance, Dias. Fortunately we have money enough\nat Lima to replace the animals. We have pretty well finished all our\nstores, and beyond the tents and the bedding, which would be a matter\nof a hundred dollars, there is nothing worth thinking of; still,\ncertainly I do not want to lose it. I hope we sha'n't fall in with any\nof those scoundrels.\"\n\n\"I hope not, senor. Perhaps we had better put our gold dust and money\nin Jose's boots. They are less likely to examine him than they are us.\n\n\"You had better put half in his boots, and give the other half to my\nwife to hide about her clothes. We shall want some money, if we are\nrobbed, to take us down to Lima. With the gold dust we could get a\ncouple of mules and enough provisions to take us down there. We should\nbe in a very awkward position if we found ourselves penniless.\"\n\nThey stopped for the night at a little village close to the lake. There\nwas but one small room at the inn, but at the other end of the\nstraggling village there was a yard where the mules could stand, and a\nloft where Dias, Maria, and Jose could sleep.\n\nHarry and his brother had lain down but an hour on their blankets when\nthere was a shouting in the street, and two or three shots were fired.\nThey leapt up.\n\n\"We had better hide our rifles and pistols,\" Harry said, \"under that\nragged bed that we did not care about sleeping on. We may possibly get\nthem again even if we are robbed of everything else.\"\n\nA minute later four or five men with a lantern rushed into the room.\nThey were all armed with muskets, and one carried a torch.\n\n\"Who are you?\" this man asked.\n\n\"We are English sportsmen,\" Harry said. \"We have been shooting for some\nmonths at the foot of the hills, and are now returning to Lima. There\nare our guns, you see.\"\n\n\"We will take you before the captain,\" the man said. \"Bring those guns\nalong, Pedro and Juan.\"\n\nThe village was in an uproar. Some fifty men were occupied in searching\nthe houses and in appropriating everything they thought useful. One\nhouse had been set on fire, and near this a man in an officer's uniform\nwas standing. He heard the report of Harry's and Bertie's capture.\n\n\"English sportsmen, eh! How long have you been shooting?\" he asked.\n\n\"Eight months.\"\n\n\"Eight months! Then guard them securely, Montes; they are doubtless\nrich Englishmen, and we shall get a good ransom for them. English\nsenors who come out here to shoot must be men with plenty of money; but\nlikely enough they are not sportsmen, but gold-seekers. However, it\nmatters little.\"\n\n\"I protest against this,\" Harry said. \"Our consul at Lima will demand\nsatisfaction from the government.\"\n\nThe other laughed.\n\n\"Government!\" he said, \"there is no government; and if there were, they\nwould have no power up in the hills.\"\n\nSo saying he turned away.\n\nPlunder that had been collected was brought in and divided among the\nparty, four of the men with muskets keeping guard over the prisoners.\n\n\"I don't see anything of Dias and the mules,\" Bertie said in English.\n\n\"No, I have been expecting to see them brought up every minute. Now I\nam beginning to hope that they have got safely off. I think the fellows\nbegan their attack at our end of the village.\n\n\"You know how watchful Dias is. Very likely he or Jose were up, and you\nmay be sure that the moment they heard the uproar they would drive the\nmules out and be off. You see only two of them are laden, and they\ncould have thrown the things on to their backs and been off at once. He\nwould know that it was useless to wait for us. I expect he would turn\nthem off the road at once and make down towards the lake. If these\nfellows had caught him and the mules they would certainly have brought\nthem up here before this.\"\n\n\"I hope he got off--not so much because of the mules, as because I am\nsure that, if he gets fairly away, he will do what he can to help us.\"\n\n\"I am sure he will, Bertie. We must make the best of it. There is one\nthing, we have got a good month before us. It will take them all that\ntime to go down to Lima about our ransom and return; and it is hard if\nwe don't give them the slip before that.\"\n\nA quarter of an hour later the band started with their booty and\nprisoners for the hills.\n\n\"I don't suppose they will go far,\" Harry said. \"Quinda has got his\nhands full, and will be wanting to start as soon as he can to join\nVivancohidas. He won't lose time in hunting the scoundrel who has\ncaught us, so I expect the band make their head-quarters in some\nvillage at the foot of the hills.\"\n\nThis turned out to be so. After a march of four hours the band halted\nin a village in a valley running up into the hills. The prisoners were\nthrust into an empty hut, and four men with muskets told off as their\nguard. Next morning the captain of the band came in.\n\n\"I shall require a hundred thousand dollars for your ransom,\" he said.\n\n\"We could never pay such a sum,\" Harry said. \"We are not rich men. I am\na lieutenant on half-pay in the English navy, and, having nothing to do\nat home, came out with my brother for a year's sport. I could not pay a\ntenth of that sum.\"\n\n\"That we shall see,\" the man said. \"If you cannot pay, your government\ncan. You will at once write to your consul at Lima, telling him that if\nthis hundred thousand dollars are not handed over to my messenger\nwithin four days of his arrival there, you will both have your throats\ncut.\"\n\n\"I will write the letter if you wish,\" Harry replied quietly, \"but you\nwon't get the money. If you like to say ten thousand dollars, I dare\nsay the consul will do his best to raise that amount.\"\n\n\"One hundred thousand is the smallest sum,\" the man said angrily. \"He\ncan get it out of the government there. They will not choose to risk\nhaving trouble with your country for the sake of such a sum.\"\n\n\"Gamarra is away,\" Harry said, \"and it is pretty certain that he will\nnot have left a hundred thousand dollars in the treasury; and even if\nhe has, you maybe sure that his people there would not give it up, for\nhe wants every penny for his war expenses.\"\n\nThe man shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"So much the worse for you. Write as I told you; here is paper, pen,\nand ink. Do not write in English. I will come back in a quarter of an\nhour for it.\"\n\n\"This is awkward, Bertie. It is evident that I must write. As to their\npaying twenty thousand pounds, the thing is absurd; if he had mentioned\ntwo thousand they might have considered the matter. What I hope is that\nthey will not send up anything. I feel certain that we shall be able to\nget away from here within a month; and if they were to send up one or\ntwo thousand pounds, we should probably miss the fellow on the way. In\nthat case we should have to repay the money when we got to Lima, which\nI certainly should not see my way to do--anyhow, until I got to\nEngland, when I could, of course, sell out some of my stock. There is\nnothing here that we could use as invisible ink. If there were, I would\nrisk writing a message with it; but even then it is fifty to one\nagainst their bringing it to light. Well, here goes!\" and he wrote in\nSpanish the required message.\n\nThe robber on his return read it through, turned the paper over to see\nthat nothing was written on the back, and held it up to the light.\n\n\"That will do,\" he said. \"Now let me warn you, don't attempt to escape.\nYou won't succeed if you do, and the sentries have orders to shoot you\ndown should you attempt it.\"\n\nThe time passed slowly. The brigand was evidently determined to give\nthem no chance of escaping, and four sentries remained round the hut,\none at each corner. In the daytime the prisoners were allowed to sit at\nthe door of the hut, but they were shut up at nightfall. The guards\nwere not allowed to speak to them, and there was therefore no chance of\noffering them a bribe. On the evening of the fifth day they had, as\nusual, been shut up, and were chatting over the situation.\n\n\"If they continue to guard us like this, Bertie, I really don't see a\nshadow of a chance of getting away. We calculated on there being one,\nor perhaps two sentries at the door, and thought we could have cut a\nhole through that adobe wall at the back and crept out through it; but\nas there is a guard at each corner, I don't see a chance of it. The\nfellows are evidently afraid of their captain, and each keeps to his\ncorner, and sits there and smokes and drones out songs, but they never\nmove till they are relieved. Of course we must make the attempt if we\nsee no other way of escaping. But I have still great hope that Dias\nwill somehow or other try to get us out, though how he can do it I\ndon't know.\"\n\nThey observed that the sentries were not changed in any military way.\nFive minutes before sunset the four men who were to relieve those on\nguard came sauntering up. The former guard ordered the captives into\nthe hut and bolted the door, and then after a short chat with the\nothers went off, the new sentries having already taken their posts at\nthe corners of the hut. On the fifth evening after their capture they\nsaw approaching a peasant woman sitting on a mule. A man was walking\nbeside her. Behind the woman was a small barrel, and two packs and two\nsmall wine-skins hung on each side.\n\n\"Harry,\" Bertie exclaimed, \"I believe that is Dias and Maria!\"\n\n\"It is,\" Harry said. \"Thank God they have found us! Twenty to one they\nwill get us out. What have they got with them, I wonder?\"\n\nThey stopped in the road opposite the house, which was the end one in\nthe village.\n\n\"You are not to come nearer,\" one of the sentries shouted.\n\n\"I am sure I don't want to come nearer,\" the woman said pertly. \"You\ndon't think you are so handsome that I want to get a better sight of\nyour face?\"\n\n\"What have you got there?\" the man asked. \"We shall be coming off duty\nin ten minutes.\"\n\n\"Well, we have got a little of everything,\" she said. \"As pretty sashes\nas there are in the country, beautiful silk neckerchiefs, silver\nbrooches for your sweethearts, and for those who purchase freely a\nglass of the best pisco spirit.\"\n\n\"Well, wait, and I dare say we shall lay out a dollar or two.\"\n\nA minute or two later four other men sauntered up, and began to talk to\nMaria, who slipped off her mule. The guards, fearful that the best\nbargains would be sold before they could get forward, hurried the\nprisoners into the hut and bolted the door. The brothers heard a great\ndeal of talking and arguing, and ten minutes later the sentries came up\nto their usual post.\n\n\"I would not mind betting odds,\" Bertie said with delight, \"that Dias\nhas drugged that spirit.\"\n\n\"I expect so, Bertie. He would be sure that they could not resist it,\nfor it is the best spirit there is in Peru.\"\n\nFor a time the sentries talked, saying that the pedlars' goods were\ncheap and the spirit as good as any they had ever tasted. \"We had great\ndifficulty in getting her to sell us a second glass each; and she was\nright, for she had not much of it, and it must help her rarely to sell\nher goods. The husband seemed a surly sort of chap. I wonder such a\npretty little woman would marry such a fellow.\"\n\n\"I suppose he was well-to-do and she was poor,\" another said; \"such is\ngenerally the case when you see a marriage like that. I dare say he\nmakes a good thing of it; the goods are as cheap, though, as they would\nbe in Lima.\"\n\nGradually the talking ceased, and within an hour there was perfect\nquiet outside the hut. Half an hour later they heard footsteps coming\nquietly up to the door. They held their breath; but instead of, as they\nexpected, hearing the bolt drawn, they heard the new-comers going round\nthe hut, pausing a minute at each corner. Then they again stopped at\nthe door; the two bolts were shot back, and the door opened.\n\n\"Come, senors,\" Dias said; \"it is quite safe. We have put them all to\nsleep. Here are their muskets and pistols. You had better take them, in\ncase we are pursued, which is not likely. At any rate, should one of\nthem wake the want of a gun will mean delay in raising the alarm.\n\n\"Don't speak, senors; it is as well to keep quiet till we are fairly\noff.\" He shut the door and rebolted it, and then led the way down into\nthe road.\n\nNot a word was spoken till they had gone a hundred yards, and then\nHarry said: \"You have done us another good turn, Dias; we did not see\nany possible way of getting out; but we both agreed that if you could\nfind us you would.\"\n\n\"Of course, senors, you could not suppose that Maria and I would go\nquietly off.\"\n\n\"How did you manage to get away, Dias?\"\n\n\"It was easy enough. After what we had heard of these brigands I made\nup my mind that I would not unsaddle the mules, nor take the packs off\nthe two loaded ones. The burdens were not heavy, for we have little but\nour bedding and the tents left, and I thought they might as well stay\nwhere they were, and in the morning we could shift them on to the\nothers. I told Jose to watch about half the night; but I was standing\ntalking to him, and smoking my last cigarette, when he said suddenly,\n'I can hear a noise at the other end of the village.'\n\n\"The evening was still, and I could also hear the sound of many\nfootsteps, so I ran and pulled down the bar at the back of the yard,\ncalled Maria, and told her and Jose to take the mules straight down to\nthe lake, and then to follow the bank. Then I ran to warn you; but\nbefore I got half-way I heard shouts and firing, and knew that I was\ntoo late, so I ran back to the lake, where I overtook the mules, and we\nmounted and went off at a trot. When I got a quarter of a mile away I\ntold the others to go on to Junin, which we knew was twenty miles away,\nand put up there till I joined them. Then I ran back to the village,\nand, keeping myself well behind a house, watched them getting ready to\nstart, and saw you. There was nothing to do but to follow you. I did\nso, and observed where they had shut you up, and I waited about for\nsome hours, so as to see how you were guarded.\n\n\"I saw their captain go into your hut twice. When he came out the\nsecond time he had a paper in his hand. He went to the house he has\ntaken possession of, and I kept a good watch over that. Presently two\nlieutenants came out, talking together. They entered another house, and\nten minutes afterwards issued out again, dressed in ordinary clothes,\nsuch as a muleteer or a cultivator fairly well off would wear, and\nreturned to the captain's house, and stayed there for a good half-hour\nbefore they came out again. Two horses had been brought round to the\ndoor. The captain came out with them, and was evidently giving them\nsome last instructions. Then they rode off, saying good-bye to some of\nthe men as they passed through the village.\n\n\"Knowing the ways of these bandits, I had no doubt the paper I saw\ntheir captain bring out of the hut where you were was a letter he had\ncompelled you to write to request a large sum of money to be sent in\nexchange for you; and as I felt certain that we should rescue you\nsomehow, I thought it was a pity that this letter should go down, so I\nstarted at once to follow them. They had not got more than a quarter of\nan hour's start of me, and by the line they had taken I saw that they\nintended to go to Junin. I did not think it likely that they would\nenter the place, because they would be sure to meet some of Quinda's\nmen there; but would probably sleep at some small village near it, and\nthen make a circuit to strike the road beyond the town.\n\n\"Fortunately I had some money in my pocket, and at the first farm I\ncame to I bought a mule. You see, senor, I had not lain down the night\nbefore, and had done a fair day's work before I started to follow your\ncaptors. I had walked twenty miles with them, and had been busy all the\nmorning. I knew it could not be much less than thirty miles to Junin,\nand that if I could not find them there I should have to push on after\nthem again the next morning, so I gave the farmer what he asked for his\nmule, and started at once on it barebacked. It turned out to be a good\nanimal, and I rode hard, for I wanted to get down to Junin before the\ntwo men. I reckoned I should do that, because, as they were going a\nvery long journey, they would not want to press their horses, and\nbesides would prefer that it should be dark before they stopped for the\nnight.\n\n\"When I got to Junin I found Maria and Jose, who had put up the mules\nat the only inn there. I set Maria to watch on the road leading into\nthe town, and went out with Jose to a little village a mile back, where\nI made sure the fellows would stop. I was not long in finding out that\nthey had arrived about half an hour after I had ridden through, and had\nput up at the priest's. That was good enough for me. We went back to\nthe town. I had some supper, which I can tell you I wanted badly, for I\nhad been afraid of going into the brigand's village to buy anything,\nas, being a stranger, I might have been asked questions, so I had had\nnothing since the night before. I had found that there was a road from\nthe place where they had stopped, by which they could ride along by the\nlake without going into the town; so Jose and I ambushed there an hour\nbefore daylight, thinking that they would be off early. We were right;\nfor in a quarter of an hour they came along. Day was just breaking, so\nwe could make out their figures easily enough, and as they were not\nfive yards away as they passed, we were not likely to miss them. Well,\nI found the paper you had written in the coat-pocket of one of them,\ntogether with two hundred dollars, no doubt for the expenses of his\njourney. We hid the two bodies under a heap of stones.\"\n\n\"Then you killed them, Dias?\" Harry said, in a tone of surprise.\n\n\"Of course! what else would one do with them? They were brigands, and\nthey had attacked a peaceable village and killed several people. Even\nif I had not wanted to get your paper it would have been a very\nmeritorious action.\"\n\n\"Oh, I am not blaming you, Dias, at all! There was no other way of\ngetting the paper, and it may be regarded as an act of necessity. And\nwhat did you do with their horses?\"\n\n\"Jose went on with them, and I returned to the town again and started\nwith Maria and the mules. We journeyed to a village half-way to Oroya.\nOf course we overtook Jose a mile or two after we had left Junin. There\nwe put up at a quiet place and talked over the situation. We knew that\nthere was no particular hurry, for we read your letter, and knew that\nno harm would come to you for a long time. It would be a month at least\nbefore they would expect the men back with the money. There was another\nletter, addressed to Don Mariano Carratala, whom I know to be a busy\npolitician in Lima. The money was to be paid to him; at least he was to\nreceive it from the two men immediately they left the British consul's\nhouse, and he was to hold it for Valdez, which is the name of the\nbrigand.\"\n\n\"I thought he would not trust the men to bring up a sum like that.\"\n\n\"It would be enough to tempt the most incorruptible Peruvian, and\ncertainly the men he sent down would have taken good care never to come\nto this part of the country again if they had got the money into their\npossession. I don't think either it would have been safe in the hands\nof Carratala, if he did not know that sooner or later he would get a\nknife between his shoulders if he kept it. Next morning Maria and I\nstarted back, bringing with us four mules, the fastest we had. We rode\non two and led the others. I knew some people at Junin, for I have\noften passed through the town when I have been bringing down silver\nfrom Cerro, and one managed to get for us that little barrel of pisco.\nI was sure that no soldier would refuse a glass; but it was almost a\nsin to give such liquor to the dogs. Then we bought peasants' clothes,\nand a parcel of goods such as travelling hawkers carry.\n\n\"You know how we succeeded. Of course we had drugged the pisco heavily,\nand knew that two glasses would send any man off to sleep in half an\nhour. As soon as it was dark, Maria went on with the mule. We shall\nfind her half a mile from here at a deserted hut where we left the\nother three mules.\"\n\n\"Well, Dias, you have assuredly saved our lives. Guarded as we were,\nthere was not the slightest chance of our getting away by ourselves;\nand as the British consul certainly could not have raised the sum they\ndemanded, we should have had our throats cut when the messengers\nreturned empty-handed. Valdez is not the man to go back from his word\nin that respect.\"\n\n\"It is a pity you have lost your arms, senor.\"\n\n\"Yes, we have certainly lost our double-barrelled guns, but our rifles\nand pistols are hidden in the straw of the bed in the room where we\nslept. We had just time to hide them before the brigands burst into the\nroom.\"\n\n\"Then we can recover them, senor. Of course I intended to ride straight\nto Junin, but it won't make very much difference. We will ride to the\nvillage, get the rifles and pistols, and then follow the road by the\nlake. It is now only nine o'clock; we can be there by one easily, and\nreach Junin by morning. It will be perfectly safe to rest there. I\nsuppose your guards will be relieved about twelve o'clock?\"\n\n\"Yes, that was the time we heard them changed.\"\n\n\"They will most likely discover that you have gone then. When they find\nthe four guards sound asleep, they are sure to unbolt the door and see\nif you are there, then of course they will give the alarm at once. But\nI hardly think they will even attempt to pursue. They are infantry, and\nnone of them are mounted but the officers, which means that at present\nonly Valdez himself has a horse. They would know that you had been\nassisted, and that probably horses were waiting for you somewhere.\nThere is the hut, senors.\"\n\nMaria ran out as they came up.\n\n\"The saints be praised,\" she exclaimed, \"that you are with us again,\nsenors!\"\n\n\"The saints are no doubt to be praised,\" Harry said, \"but we feel at\npresent a good deal more indebted to Dias and yourself than to them. We\nare indeed grateful to you both, and you managed it splendidly. My\nbrother and I felt so confident that you would do something to get us\nout, that we were not in the least surprised when we recognized you and\nDiaz got up as travelling hawkers.\"\n\n\"You did not tell them that we were with you?\"\n\n\"No. Fortunately they asked no questions at all, and took us for\nEnglishmen travelling by ourselves. They may have thought of it\nafterwards, but in the hurry of carrying off their booty they\napparently gave the matter no attention. If they had done so they would\nprobably have sent a party out in pursuit of the mules. Even if they\nhad not done so, they would have been sure to look with some suspicion\nat two hawkers arriving at such an out-of-the-way village at such a\ntime.\"\n\n\"Well, we had better be moving at once,\" Dias said. \"We are going down\nto the village where they were captured, Maria. They hid their rifles\nand pistols there when they found the place was in the hands of the\nbrigands.\"\n\nThree minutes later they started. There was a full moon, so they were\nable to ride fast, and it was just midnight when they arrived at the\nvillage. When they knocked at the house where their rifles had been\nleft, the proprietor looked out from the upper window in great dismay,\nfearing that the brigands might have returned. However, as soon as he\nrecognized the party he came down and opened the door. The arms were\nfound where they had been hidden, and in five minutes they were again\non their way, and arrived at Junin at five o'clock. It was necessary to\nwait here twenty-four hours to rest the animals. The next morning they\nstarted as soon as it was light, and picked up Jose and the convoy. The\nbrothers mounted the two horses, and Dias and Maria rode on one mule,\nand led three behind them. Jose rode another and led four. The horses\nand the mule Dias had bought were sold at Oroya, and after purchasing\nenough provisions for the rest of their journey they started for Lima,\nhaving concluded that it would be better, now that they were on the\nmain track, to follow it instead of striking across the hills.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nLETTERS FROM HOME\n\n\nThere was some little discussion over the amount of supplies that it\nwould be necessary to purchase.\n\n\"Travelling quietly, the journey will not occupy over fourteen days,\"\nHarry said. \"Do not get anything more than is absolutely necessary. It\nis evident that the whole country is in a disturbed state, and it is as\nwell to have nothing to lose. We can buy nearly everything we want in\nthe way of meat and flour at villages we pass through. Therefore, if we\nhave enough tea, coffee, and sugar there will be really no occasion to\nbuy anything more. We have still two or three bottles of spirits left,\nand you can buy pulque everywhere. There is a proverb two or three\nthousand years old, 'The empty traveller can sing before the robber'.\nWe are reduced to that condition, except for our tents, bedding, and\nblankets, and they have done good service and would not cost much to\nreplace. There remain, then, only the animals. They would certainly be\na serious loss to us.\"\n\n\"Brigands would not want to take them. They would not be of the least\nuse to them in the mountains. I would not say the same of parties of\ndisbanded soldiers making their way down to Lima or Callao, who might\nprefer riding to travelling all that distance.\"\n\n\"The brigands might take our rifles and pistols, Dias.\"\n\n\"Yes, they would be sure to do that, senor. But we have had more than\nour share of bad luck already, what with the brigands in the Cerro\npass, and these rascals we have just had to do with. I will enquire\nwhen the last silver convoy went down. If one has gone during the past\nfive or six days, we could overtake it soon, for we can do two days'\njourney to its one. If no convoy has gone forward later, and there is\none starting shortly, it might be worth our while to wait for it, for\nby all accounts the road down to Lima is infested by discharged\nsoldiers, and ruffians of all kinds from Callao and Lima.\"\n\n\"Have the convoys an escort?\"\n\n\"Yes, senors. The silver mines have always a considerable force in\ntheir pay. They used to have troops from the division stationed here,\nbut what with the constant revolutions, and the fact that more than\nonce the escort, instead of protecting the convoys, mutinied and seized\nthem, they found it better to raise a force themselves. They do not\ntake Creoles, preferring pure-bred Indians, who are just as brave as\nthe Creoles, if not braver, and can be relied upon to be faithful to\ntheir trust. The consequence is that, in spite of the disturbed state\nof the country, it is a long time now since one of their escorts has\nbeen attacked, especially as the robbers would find great difficulty in\ndisposing of the silver, as each ingot is marked with the name of the\nmine it comes from.\n\n\"They might, of course, melt it up again; but even then there would be\na difficulty, as the law is very strict as to the sale of silver, and a\ncertificate has to be obtained from the local authorities in every\ncase, stating where it was obtained. This is hard upon the natives, for\nmany of the little mines are worked among the mountains, and the\nrascals, to whom all official positions are given in reward for\nservices done to the party which happens to be in power for the time,\ntake good care to fleece the Indians heavily before they will give them\nthe necessary documents. Nothing can be done here, senors, without\ngreasing the palms of two or three people, and the grease has to be\npretty heavily laid on.\"\n\nDias went out and made enquiries. \"There will be no convoy for another\nfortnight. One went down ten days ago.\"\n\n\"I certainly shall not wait another fortnight, Dias. As to an escort,\nless than a dozen men would be useless, and as they would be a\nfortnight at least going down, and as much returning, even if you could\nget twelve men who could be relied upon, it would be a very expensive\njob. We might as well risk losing our baggage, and even our guns. The\ngreat thing will be to reduce the weight as much as possible. Four\ncotton beds take up a lot of space, and I think in any case I should\nhave bought new ones at Lima; at any rate they can go. The blankets and\nponchos we could, of course, carry behind us. So that practically there\nare only the two tents, cooking utensils, and the stores, which will\nnot weigh many pounds, to carry, and with our clothes the whole will\nmake a ridiculously small load even for one mule. We had better get rid\nof the pickaxes and shovels, they would fetch pretty nearly as much\nhere as we should give for new ones at Lima.\n\n\"Thus, then, with Donna Maria riding one of the mules, there would be\nour five selves and three led mules, of which only one would be laden.\nThat would offer no great temptation to plunderers; and as we shall all\nhave guns across our shoulders, they would see that it would not be\nworth while to interfere on the very slight chance that the one laden\nmule might be carrying anything valuable.\"\n\n\"I agree with you, senor. Our appearance would be that of a party of\ntravellers who have been exploring the old ruins, or, as has been done\nbefore, endeavouring to ascertain whether the rivers on the east are\nnavigable down to the Amazon. Besides, the bulk of the people here do\nnot forget what they owe to Englishmen, and the fact that you are of\nthat nation would in itself secure good treatment for you among all\nexcept desperate men.\"\n\nAccordingly they started the next morning. Maria rode, in Amazon\nfashion, on a mule between her husband and Harry. Bertie followed with\nJose, to whose saddle the three baggage mules were attached in single\nfile. They were undisturbed on their journey. Three or four times they\nwere hailed by men on the rocks above as they went through difficult\npoints of the pass. The reply of Dias, that the two gentlemen with him\nwere Englishmen who had been exploring the ruins and doing a little\nshooting among the hills, generally satisfied them. One or two,\nhowever, who enquired what the mule was carrying, were invited by him\nto come down and see, though at the same time they were informed that\nthe load contained nothing but blankets and cooking vessels, and enough\nprovisions to last them on the way.\n\nWhen, within two days' journey from Lima, a party of rough men came\ndown into the road, Dias rode forward to meet them and repeated his\nusual story. \"You can examine the mule if you like,\" he said, \"but I\nwarn you not to interfere with us; the English senors are not men to be\nmeddled with. They are armed with rifles, and each carries a brace of\ndouble-barrelled pistols. They are dead shots, too, and you may reckon\nthat it will cost you over a dozen lives were you to interfere with\nthem. Moreover, the other muleteer and myself could give a fair account\nof ourselves. Rather than have trouble, however, two of you can come\nforward and see that my statement as to what the mule carries is\ncorrect. Its burden would not fetch fifty dollars at Lima.\"\n\nTwo of the men came forward and examined the mule's burden, and felt\nthe saddles of the others to see that nothing was concealed there. When\nthey rejoined their party one who appeared to be their leader came\nforward.\n\n\"Senors,\" he said, \"I regret that we have stopped you; but we are poor\nmen, and are obliged to take to the road to live. Perhaps your honours\nwould not mind giving us ten dollars to buy food at the next village.\"\n\n[Illustration: THEY SAW APPROACHING A PEASANT WOMAN SITTING ON A MULE.]\n\n\"I have not many dollars left,\" Harry said, \"but if you really need\nfood you are welcome to ten of them, for we shall need nothing more\nthan what we carry till we arrive at Lima.\" He handed him the ten\ndollars, and then, showing him his purse, said, \"You see there are but\nfive others.\"\n\nWith many thanks the man retired, and he and his companions took off\ntheir hats as Harry and his party rode through them.\n\n\"Another such stoppage,\" Harry said with a laugh, \"and we shall have to\nfall back upon our little stock of gold-dust.\"\n\nHowever, they met with no more trouble, and on the following evening\nrode into Lima and took up their quarters at the hotel. Dias asked that\nhe might go on with the mules to his home.\n\n\"In the first place, senor, we want to know how things have gone on in\nour absence. We had arranged with neighbours to look after the garden\nand the house. They were glad to do so, as the garden was a fruitful\none. They were to take all they could raise and keep it well planted,\nso that whenever we might return we should find our usual supply of\nfruits and vegetables. In the next place, Maria is nervous about my\nstaying here after what happened last time. We may take it as certain\nthat the friends of the men we hurt will take the chance of paying off\nthe score if they can find an opportunity. I shall come in each day to\nsee if you have any orders for me.\"\n\n\"There will be no occasion for that, Dias. We have quite made up our\nminds to wait here for a week before starting on our next expedition,\nso if you will come over in four days that will be quite soon enough.\nYou can overhaul the blankets and bags, and see that those good enough\nto keep are put in good repair, and those worn out replaced. We shall\nwant quite as many stores as those we took last time, for there are\nvery few villages except on the sea-shore, and we shall find difficulty\nin replenishing our stock. We shall have to buy double-barrelled guns\nin place of those we lost, but that we shall do ourselves. We have\nplenty of ammunition and cartridges for the rifles and pistols, but we\nhad only a few shot cartridges left when we lost the guns.\"\n\nAs soon as Dias had gone on with the mules Harry went to the British\nconsul's and found three letters waiting there for him, two from Miss\nFortescue and one from Mr. Barnett. He put the former into his pocket\nto be read and enjoyed privately, but opened that of Mr. Barnett at\nonce. It was in answer to that Harry had written at Cuzco.\n\n\"My dear Harry,\" he said,\n\n\"Your first letter was quite satisfactory. I was glad to find that you\nhad reached Lima without encountering more than a stiffish gale, which\nwas as well as you could have expected. I was still more glad that you\nhad found Dias alive and willing to accompany you. Your letter from\nCuzco has now reached me. I think you were extremely lucky to get\nthrough that street broil without any damage to either of you. It was\ncertainly a hazardous business to interfere in an affair of that kind\nwithout having any weapons except the sticks you carried. Still, I can\nwell understand that, as you would certainly have lost the services of\nDias had you not done so, it was worth running a good deal of risk;\nand, as you say, it had the natural effect of binding him to you heart\nand soul.\n\n\"I feel very uneasy about you both, and have blamed myself many a time\nfor suggesting this scheme to you. I can only say that it is really the\nonly possible way in which it seemed to me you could carry out the task\nset you. In fairy stories it is, so far as I can remember, a not\nuncommon thing for a king to set some task, that appears absolutely\nhopeless, to the suitors for his daughter's hand, and the hero always\naccomplishes the impossible. But this is always done with the\nassistance of some good fairy, and unfortunately good fairies are not\nto be met with in the present day. I have great faith in Dias, but fear\nthat he is a very poor substitute for a fairy godmother. Still, I am\nconvinced that he will do all in his power, and will even strain his\nconscience severely, by conducting you to places where his traditions\nlead him to believe that gold, either in the shape of mines or hidden\ntreasure, is to be found.\n\n\"Your search will not improbably lead you into places where the Indians\nhave won back their own from the civilization introduced by the\nSpaniards, and I have always heard that on the eastern side of the\nCordilleras the natives entertain a deadly hatred for whites, and\nattack all who endeavour to penetrate into the forest. Don't be too\nrash, lad. Remember that it will not add to your lady-love's happiness\nto learn that you have been massacred in your attempt to carry out your\nknight-errant adventure, and if you are careless about your own life,\ndon't forget that its loss will probably entail the loss of your\nbrother's also. Dangers, of course, you must meet and face, but\nremember that prudence is a valuable aid to bravery.\n\n\"I am glad to know that Dias has taken his wife with him. A woman is a\nvery useful adjunct to an expedition such as yours. Of course in some\nways she is necessarily a trouble, and always a responsibility. Still,\nif, as you say is the case with her, she is a good cook, this makes a\nwonderful difference in your comfort, and certainly adds to the chance\nof your preserving your health. And in the next place, should you fall\nill, or be mauled by a tiger or puma, she will make a far better nurse\nthan Dias himself would be. Now that you are cutting yourself adrift\nfrom civilization, I shall not expect to hear from you again for a long\ntime. I shall try and not be uneasy; but really, Harry, I do feel that\nI have incurred a very heavy responsibility, and may, with the best\nintentions in the world, have sent you and Bertie to your death. I\nhave, as you directed me, addressed this to the care of our consul, and\nit must be many months before you receive it, many months more before I\nagain hear from you. Should you require more money, draw upon me. I\nhave always a good balance standing at the bank, therefore do not\nhesitate to draw, in case the amount sent out to you quarterly does not\nprove sufficient to carry out any scheme you may have in hand.\n\n\"With all good wishes for your own and Bertie's welfare,\n\n\"I remain,\n\n\"Your affectionate guardian,\n\n\"JAMES BARNETT.\"\n\nWhen he returned to the hotel he handed Mr. Barnett's letter to Bertie\nto read, and said:\n\n\"Stop down here in the patio, Bertie; I have two letters that I want to\nread quietly.\"\n\nBertie laughed.\n\n\"All right, Harry; take your time over them; I won't disturb you.\"\n\nIt was dusk now, and when Harry went to his room he lit a couple of\ncandles and seated himself in a large cane arm-chair and opened his\nletters.\n\nThe first one consisted chiefly of expressions of pleasure at his\narrival at Callao, of remarks upon the voyage, of complaints as to the\nlong time that had passed without news of him, and of assurances of\naffection.\n\nThe second was, like Mr. Barnett's, in reply to his letter from Cuzco.\n\n\"My dearest Harry,\n\n\"After reading your letter I have been more and more impressed with my\nheartlessness in allowing you to undertake such a journey as you have\nbefore you. I ought to have been braver. I ought to have refused\nabsolutely to allow you to go. The prospect of your being able to\novercome my father's objections really amounts to nothing, and I ought\nto have said that I would not accept the sacrifice, and would not allow\nyou to run such risks; that it would be better and kinder for both of\nus to accept the inevitable, and not enter upon such a struggle with\nfate.\n\n\"Do not think that I am already growing weary of waiting, and that my\nheart is in any way changed. It is not that. It is anxiety about you,\nand the feeling how wrong I was to let you go. Were there even a shadow\nof chance of your success I would wait patiently for years. I do not\nsay that my life is a pleasant one. It is not. My father is still\nbitterly angry with me for, as he says, throwing away my chances; that\nis to say, of marrying a man I do not care for, simply because he is\nrich. But I can bear that. Mother is very very good, and does all in\nher power to cheer me; but, as you know, she has never been much more\nthan a cipher, accustomed always to submit to my father's will, and it\nis wonderful to me that in our matter she has ventured, not openly to\noppose him, but to give me what strength and comfort she can.\n\n\"I hardly know how I should have got on without her comfort. My father\nhardly speaks to me. He treats me as if I had been convicted of some\ndeadly sin, and is only restrained from punishing me in some way\nbecause, by some blunder or other, contumacy against the will of a\nfather has been omitted from the penal code. Seriously, Harry, it makes\nme unhappy, not only for myself but for him. Until I was unable to give\nin to him in this question he has always been the kindest of fathers. I\nam sure he feels this estrangement between us almost as much as I do,\nbut believes that he is acting for my good; and it is a great pain to\nhim that I cannot see the matter in the same light as he does. Of\ncourse to me it is most ridiculous that he should suppose that my\nhappiness depends upon having a title, and cutting a figure at court,\nand that sort of thing; but there is no arguing over it, and I am as\nthoroughly convinced that my view is the correct one as he is that it\nis utter folly.\n\n\"However, I am almost as sorry for him as for myself, and would do\nalmost anything short of giving you up to make him happy. However, do\nnot think that I am very miserable, because I am not. Somehow, though I\ncan't give any good reason for my belief, I do think you will succeed.\nI do not say that I think for a moment you are likely to come home with\nthe sum my father named as necessary; that seems to be quite hopeless.\nBut I think somehow you may succeed in doing well; and though some\npeople might consider that he was justified in refusing his consent to\nwhat he might think was a bad match, he could not do so with any\njustice were I to determine upon marrying a gentleman with some\nfortune. He thinks a great deal of public opinion, and would know that\neven chat would be against him. But Indeed, Harry, I am beginning to\ndoubt whether in the end I shall be able to sacrifice my life to his\nunfortunate mania, that I must marry what he calls well. I love you,\nand told him that if at the end of two years you were not in a position\nto claim my hand, I would give in to my father's wishes. I will keep my\npromise so far, that I will not run away with you or marry you in\ndefiance of his command. But as I have agreed to wait for two years for\nyou, I may ask you to wait another two years for me.\n\n\"When I think of you going through all sorts of dangers and hardships\nfor my sake, I feel that it would be downright wickedness to turn\nagainst you if you find that you cannot perform an impossible task.\nInstead of this separation making you less dear to me, it is affecting\nme in quite the other way. My thoughts are always with you. How could\nit be otherwise? I have worked myself up to such a pitch that I have\nalmost resolved that, when the two years are up, I will say to my\nfather: 'I shall ask Harry to release me from my promise to him, and\nfor two years, Father, I will go about and allow men a fair chance of\nwinning my love. If at the end of that time I have met no one to whom I\ncan give my heart, I will then go my own way, and if Harry will take me\nI will marry him.' It will require a great deal of courage to say so;\nbut you are doing so much to try and win me, that it would be hard\nindeed if I were to shrink from doing a little on my part.\n\n\"Still, it would make it easier for me if you should have the good\nfortune to bring home something; not because, as I have told you many\ntimes, I should shrink for a moment from renouncing all the luxuries in\nwhich I have been brought up, and for which I care so little, but\nbecause it would, in his eyes, be a proof of how earnestly you have\nstriven to do what you could to meet his requirements. I did not mean\nto say this when I began my letter, but it seems to me that it will\ngive you heart and strength in your work, and that you will see from it\nthat I, too, have taken my courage in my hand, and show you that your\nlove and faithfulness shall some day have the reward they deserve.\n\n\"God bless you and keep you, dearest,\n\n\"Your loving HILDA.\"\n\nHarry read the letter through again and again, and at last Bertie came\nin.\n\n\"What! at it still, Harry?\" he said with a laugh. \"You must have got\nyour letters by heart by this time. I have been sitting in the patio by\nmyself for two mortal hours expecting you to come down. At last I said\nto myself, 'This sort of thing will bring on madness. When a healthy\nsailor forgets that his brother is waiting for supper, to say nothing\nof himself, it is clear that there is something radically wrong.'\"\n\n\"It is evident, Bertie, that at present you know nothing of human\nnature. If there had been anything radically wrong in this letter I\nshould probably have been down long ago. It is just the contrary. Hilda\nsays that if I don't succeed here, she will give herself, or rather her\nfather, two years, and at the end of that time, if she doesn't find\nsomeone she likes better, she will marry me, whether he likes it or\nnot--at least, that is what it comes to.\"\n\n\"I congratulate you, old boy. At the same time, it is evident that she\nwould not have been worth her salt if she had arrived at any other\nconclusion. Now, having settled that comfortably, let us go and have\nsomething to eat. You appear to forget altogether that you have had\nnothing since breakfast, and it is now past eight o'clock.\"\n\n\"You boys think of nothing but eating,\" Harry grumbled.\n\n\"Well, up till now, Harry, from the time we started, I have observed\nthat you have a very healthy appetite yourself, and I can tell you it\nhas cost me half a dollar in bribing the cook to stay on beyond his\nusual hour. I did not like to tell him that you were engaged in reading\na love-letter fifty times, so I put it delicately and said that you\nwere engaged in business of importance. It went against my conscience\nto tell such a buster.\"\n\n\"There, come on, Bertie. I had begun to hope that you were growing into\na sensible fellow, but I am afraid that there is no chance of that now,\nand that you will continue to be a donkey to the end of your life.\"\n\nHarry had told Dias that they had better take two or three days at home\nbefore they came into Lima again, but to his surprise the muleteer came\nin at ten o'clock next morning.\n\n\"Well, Dias, I did not expect to see you again so soon. You have found\neverything right at home, I hope?\"\n\n\"No, senor, I am sorry to say I did not. Three days after we left here\nour house was burnt down.\"\n\n\"Burnt down, Dias! I am sorry indeed to hear that. How did it happen? I\nthought you said that you had locked it up, and left no one there.\"\n\n\"That was so, senor. The people who took over the garden were to go\ninto the house once a week to see that everything was in order; but as\nthis fire broke out only three days after I left, they had not entered\nit. Everyone says that it must have been fired on purpose, for the\nflames seem to have burst out in all parts at once. No one in the town\nthought that I had an enemy in the world, and all have been wondering\nwho could have had a grudge against me. Of course we need not go very\nfar to guess who was at the bottom of it.\"\n\n\"I suppose not, Dias. It must have been those scoundrels we gave such a\nthrashing to.\"\n\n\"There is no doubt of that, senor. But this time they have got the best\nof me, for they know very well that I have no proof against them, and\nthat it would be useless to lodge any complaint.\"\n\n\"I am afraid it would, Dias. Is it quite burnt down?\"\n\n\"The walls are standing, senor. It takes a good deal to burn adobe.\"\n\n\"What do you suppose it would cost to put it in the same condition as\nbefore, with the furniture and everything?\"\n\n\"No great thing, senor; two hundred or two hundred and fifty dollars.\nIt would not be as much as that if it hadn't been that Maria had left\nher festa dresses and her silver trinkets behind. There was not much\nfurniture in the house; but I think I could replace everything for\nabout two hundred dollars, and I have a good deal more than that laid\nby.\"\n\n\"I shall certainly make that up to you, Dias. It was entirely your\nkindness in deciding to take us on Mr. Barnett's recommendation, and to\nundertake this journey, that brought the ill-will of these scoundrels\nupon you. Of course it is of no use doing anything now, but when our\nsearch is over I shall certainly see that you are not in any way the\nloser.\"\n\n\"No, senor; if I could not replace it myself I might accept your kind\noffer, but I can do it without breaking very heavily into my savings.\nAnd indeed their attack on me was the outcome of an old grudge. I have\nbeen long regarded as a fortunate man, and truly I have been so. If\nthere was a job for five mules, and I was disengaged, I always had the\nfirst offer.\"\n\n\"But that was not fortune, Dias; that was because you were known to be\nwholly trustworthy.\"\n\n\"There are few muleteers who are not so, senor; it is rarely indeed\nthat muleteers are false to their trust. I can scarce remember an\ninstance. We Indians have our faults, but we are honest.\"\n\n\"Well, perhaps your getting the first job to go with foreign travellers\nmay have been a piece of good fortune, but it is because these were so\nwell satisfied with you that others engaged you. Trustworthiness is not\nthe only thing wanted in a muleteer; willingness, cheerfulness, and a\nreadiness to oblige are almost as important for the comfort of\ntravellers. Well, do you think these fellows will try and play you\nanother trick, Dias?\"\n\n\"I hope they will,\" Dias said savagely, \"that is, if they don't have\ntoo much odds against me. I owe them a big score now, for twice they\nhave got the better of me. I should like to get even with them.\"\n\n\"Well, Dias, I hope they won't try anything of the sort. If anything\nshould happen to you, I should not only be extremely sorry for your\nsake and your wife's, but it would destroy the last chance I have of\ncarrying out my search for treasure. Do you think that if I were to go\nto the consul and lay a complaint against them, on the ground, in the\nfirst place, of their attack on you, and now of burning your house, it\nwould have any effect?\"\n\n\"If you were to make a complaint it might do, senor; it certainly would\nnot were I to do so. A little bribe would, of course, be necessary; you\ncannot do anything without that. The officials here are all Gamarra's\nmen, and there is not one of them who would not take a bribe. But would\nit be worth while, as we are only going to stay here a week? And if you\ngot them imprisoned they would be out again before I came back, and\nwould be more anxious than ever to get rid of me.\"\n\n\"There is a good deal in that, Dias. As, of course, we shall be away,\nand starting for home again as soon as we return here, their spite\nwould be directed entirely against you.\"\n\n\"I hope, senors, that while you stop here you will never go out without\nyour pistols. It is against you they have a grudge now more than me; it\nwas owing to you that they failed in killing me.\"\n\n\"We will do so; and we won't carry sticks this time, so that if they\nsee us going along they will think we are unarmed.\"\n\nWhenever they went out after dark, indeed, Harry and Bertie had an idea\nthat they were followed, and on their way home each invariably carried\na cocked pistol in his pocket, ready for instant use. It was well that\nthey did so, for on returning late one evening from Senor Pasquez, four\nmen suddenly sprang out upon them.\n\nThey were on their guard, and their arms went up in an instant, and two\nshots were fired. As the pistols were almost touching the men's heads\nwhen the trigger was pulled, both the assailants dropped dead, and the\nothers at once took to their heels.\n\n\"There are two of Dias's enemies wiped out,\" Harry said quietly. \"I\nhope the others will give us a chance before we leave. Well, let us\nwalk on before the watch comes along. It would ruin our plans\naltogether if we were kept here for an indefinite time while enquiries\nare being made.\"\n\nThe next morning they heard from their waiter at breakfast that two men\nhad been found dead in the street.\n\n\"They are muleteers,\" he said, \"but are known to be bad characters, and\nare suspected of having been concerned in several murders. It is\nevident that they made a mistake this time, and have got what they\ndeserved. They are known to be associated with others. There were five\nof them; one was killed in a knife fight some months ago, and a search\nhas been made for the others, but it is not likely that they will be\ncaught. They were probably concerned in the affair, and knowing that\nthey would be suspected of having a hand in this, and that their\ncharacter will go against them, I expect they went off at once to the\nfoot of the hills, and won't be heard of again for some time to come.\"\n\n\"I think it a pity they were not all shot. It is a shame that in a town\nlike this people cannot walk in the streets after dark without the risk\nof being assassinated.\"\n\nDias was very pleased when, on coming up that morning, he heard of what\nhad happened. He quite agreed that the other men would almost certainly\nhave taken to the mountains.\n\n\"Even if they have not, senor, you are safe from another attack. Now\nthey know that you carry pistols, and are prepared for them, they will\nlet you alone.\"\n\n\"When we come back here, Dias, we will give you a brace of our pistols,\nand I trust you will carry them in your pocket ready for use after\ndark, whether you are in Lima or at Miraflores.\"\n\n\"Thank you, senor. I do not think they are likely to show their faces\nhere again for a long time; but at any rate I will be on my guard, and\nwill gratefully accept your offer of the pistols. Now, senors, I must\nset to work to-day to get in our stores for the next journey. I have\nmade a list of what we shall want.\"\n\n\"Well, I have plenty of money, Dias, for I find two remittances from\nhome awaiting me here. We have already bought two double-barrelled guns\nand a stock of ammunition, principally buck-shot, for we shall not be\ndoing much big game shooting. We can always buy food at the sea-side\nvillages.\"\n\nThree days later all was in readiness. The mules were brought up from\nMiraflores by Jose, accompanied by Maria, and an early start was made\non the following morning.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nTHE CASTLE OF THE DEMONS\n\n\n\"To-morrow, senor,\" Dias said, \"you will see the spot I was telling you\nabout, where, as the traditions say, the spirits of our ancestors\ninhabit the ruins of a building so old, that it was ancient when the\nIncas first came here. They are still there, and men who have been rash\nenough to approach the spot have been found torn to pieces as if by\nwild beasts; but none go near now.\"\n\n\"Did the Spaniards never go there?\"\n\n\"I know not, sir; but 'tis likely they never even heard of it. The\ncountry is all dry and barren, and there were no mines to tempt them.\nThe Indians never speak of it; those who were alive when the Spaniards\ncame had some reasons for not doing so; and even now you could go to\nthe nearest village, which lies more than twenty miles away, and ask\nthe people about it, but they would only say that they had never heard\nof it, that no such place existed, for they believe that even to speak\nof it would bring dire disaster. We Indians are Christians; the\nSpaniards made us so. We make the sign of the cross, and we bow before\ntheir images and pictures, and once a year we go to their churches; but\namong the tribes east of the mountains that is all. We believe in the\ntraditions of our fathers and in the demons of the forest; and though\non this side of the hills, where the Spaniards held a tight grip upon\nus, the people have well-nigh forgotten their old faith, they still\nbelieve in many of the tales they have learned from their fathers, and\nthis of the Castle of the Demons, as it is called, is as strong as ever\nin these parts.\"\n\n\"Have you ever seen the castle, Dias?\"\n\n\"I have seen it, senor. There is only one point from which it is\nvisible. We shall go there to-morrow, it is ten miles from here. The\ncastle lies in a rift of the rock. I should say that in ancient times\nthis opened to the sea, but the building closed the entrance. Whatever\nit may have been, it does not rise above the summit of the cliff, which\ngoes down as straight as a wall for miles on the sea-face. The rift on\nthe land side of the castle seems to have a width of about fifty feet,\nand I could see openings which were, I suppose, windows. The rocks on\neach side are higher than the castle itself, so that anyone coming\nalong would not see it until he looked down upon it.\"\n\n\"But of course it is visible from the sea, Dias?\"\n\n\"It would have been visible in the old days without a doubt, senor, but\nit cannot be seen now. The stones are the colour of the rocks beside\nthem. They are stained and broken, and unless a boat went along within\na very short distance none would dream that there was a break in the\ncliff there. I heard that from a fisherman whose boat was driven in by\na gale and well-nigh lost. He said that he could see that the stones,\nwhich are very large--much larger than any of those in the remains of\nthe buildings of the Incas--were not in regular lines.\"\n\n\"It is very strange that anyone should have taken the trouble to build\na place in such a singular position. Is there not any legend as to its\nconstruction?\"\n\n\"There is a tradition, senor, that it was built as a prison, by the\nking of those times, a thousand years before the Spaniards came, and\neven before the people whom the Incas conquered came into the land, and\nthat it was a place of imprisonment, some say of a wife, others of a\nson, who had rebelled against him. Some say that it was built by the\ndemons, but as it happened long before our people came here, none can\nknow.\"\n\n\"Well, Dias, it seems to me that this old place is very likely to have\nbeen used as a hiding-place for treasure. As to these tales about\ndemons, of course they are ridiculous. I took your advice when we were\nbeing opposed by fierce Indians, but when it is a question of demons, I\ncan trust to my revolvers and rifles against a legion of them.\"\n\n\"Well, senor, you are the master. I have led you here as I promised.\nThere may be treasure here or there may not. If you will go, you must;\nbut I pray you not to command me to go with you. I would have followed\nyou to the death through the swamps and forests on the other side, but\nI dare not risk being torn to death by demons and being left without\nburial.\"\n\n\"I do not press you to go, Dias. I respect your convictions, though I\ndo not share in them. I have had a year of travel with you, and we have\nhad many adventures together. This will be my last before I return\nhome. Here at least there seems to me a chance of finding treasure, an\ninfinitely better chance than any we have had, except in the gold\nvalley. Here is a mysterious castle, of whose very existence the\nSpaniards seem never to have heard. It is just the place where treasure\nmight be hidden. If it has guardians, they must be human, and also\nthere can be but few. The urgent necessity for secrecy was so great,\nthat it must, like all the other secrets, have been confided to a few\nonly. Maybe but one or two old men are there, of whom certainly I need\nnot be afraid. I have told you why I came here, and why I feel so\nanxious to find a valuable mine, or part of the lost treasures of the\nIncas. So far I have failed altogether, and I should be a fool as well\nas a coward were I not ready to run some slight risk in searching this\nmysterious castle.\"\n\n\"So be it, senor. I say not that you may not succeed. It may be that\nthe demons have no power over white men. If you go and return safely I\nwill go with you, and, should you find treasure, aid you to carry it\naway. I will lead you to within two miles of it, and will wait three\ndays for your return. If you come not then, I will return to my place\nand mourn for you.\"\n\n\"Very well, Dias, you may count upon my return long before the three\ndays are up. Now, in the first place, take me to the point from which I\ncan have a view of the castle.\"\n\n\"We have had a long journey to-day, senor, and it is two hours' journey\nfrom here. We had better rest and go in the morning.\"\n\nHarry nodded.\n\n\"We will be off early. You say it is ten miles from the spot where we\nshall see it. If we start at daybreak I can be there before noon, which\nwill give me plenty of time for a first look round the place. We have\ngot some torches left. I shall want them, for possibly there may be\nsome chambers underground into which we shall have to penetrate. We may\ntake it as certain that, whether the old people hid a great treasure\nfrom the Incas, or the Incas hid one from the Spaniards, they did not\nleave it about in rooms, but stowed it away in vaults like those we saw\nat Pachacamac, and these will certainly want a lot of looking for.\"\n\n\"I will help you look, senor, and will work there as long as you like\nin the search, if you return and tell me that you have seen and heard\nnothing of the demons that are said to be there. I am not afraid of\ndanger when I know that it is men that we have to do with. But I dread\nbeing strangled and torn, as the legends say that all who have ventured\nhere have been.\"\n\n\"But according to your own account, Dias,\" Bertie laughed, \"that was\nlong, long ago, and the demons may have got tired of guarding a place\nthat no one came near, and have gone elsewhere in search of victims.\"\n\nDias shook his head gravely. In spite of his life as a muleteer, and\nhis acquaintance with Englishmen, he was as superstitious as the rest\nof his countrymen. The nominal Christianity enforced by the Spaniards\nupon the natives was but skin-deep, and thus they clung with undying\nfidelity to the superstitions and traditions that had been handed down\nfrom generation to generation, and had been preserved with a tenacity\nthat even the tortures of the Spaniards had failed to shake. The\nfailure to obtain the gold which they confidently expected to find in\nthe valley had still further strengthened his belief that it was\ndestined that these treasures should never be discovered; and although\nwhen there he had listened gravely to Harry's explanations of the\nmanner in which the lake had been formed, his own conviction that all\nthis was the work of demons had been unshaken. If, then, a spot, which\neven the tradition handed down to him had in no way connected with the\nguardianship of demons, was so firmly watched, how much more must this\nbe so at a spot which all legends agreed was inhabited by demons, and\nhad been the scene of so many executions by them of those who had\nventured near.\n\nAs Bertie and his brother sat together by the fire that evening after\nthe others had retired to rest, they talked long over the matter; for\njust as when they had approached the gold valley, their excitement had\nincreased with every day's journey. Harry felt that this was his last\nchance, his only hope of gaining the object for which he had left\nEngland.\n\n\"It is strange, Harry,\" Bertie said, \"that the natives should believe\nthese absurd stories about demons. Dias seems, in every other way, as\nsensible a fellow as one can want to meet, but in this respect he is as\nbad as any of them.\"\n\n\"It is not extraordinary, Bertie, if you remember that it is not so\nvery long ago since people at home believed in witches who sailed\nthrough the air to take part in diabolic ceremonies, and brought about\nthe death of anyone by sticking pins into a little waxen image, and\nthat even now the peasantry in out-of-the-way parts of the country\nstill hold that some old women bewitch cows, and prevent milk turning\ninto butter however long they may continue churning. Fairy\nsuperstitions have not quite disappeared, and the belief in ghosts is\nvery wide-spread.\n\n\"When you think of that it is not surprising that these poor ignorant\nnatives still have implicit faith in the traditions of their ancestors.\nIt is possible that this old place is still inhabited by Indians, who\nhave been its guardians for ages, and if not now, may have had charge\nof it long after the Spaniards came here, and murdered any who ventured\nto approach the place. We know that the tradition of the gold valley\nhas been faithfully maintained in the family of Dias; this may also be\nthe case in the family to which the guardianship of this old place was\nentrusted, but to my mind it is less likely. In the case of the gold\nvalley there was nothing for those in the secret to do but to hold\ntheir tongues; but to supply guardians to this place from generation to\ngeneration must have been a much more irksome task, and it may have\nbeen abandoned, either from the dislike of those who had to spend their\nlives in such a monotonous business, or by their families dying out. I\ncertainly don't want to have a fight with men who are only following\norders passed down to them for hundreds of years. If they attack us, we\nshall have to fight; but I sincerely trust that we may find the place\ndeserted, for, fight or no fight, I mean to get the treasure if it is\nthere.\"\n\n\"I should think so,\" Bertie agreed. \"The treasure is absolutely of no\nuse to them, and may be no end of use to you.\"\n\n\"To both of us, Bertie. If there is a treasure, you may be sure it is a\nlarge one, ample for both of us, and to spare. Of course we shall have\ntrouble in getting it away--the gold would be invaluable to any of\nthese rascally adventurers who are a curse to Peru. I really want to\nsee the place, even putting aside the question of the treasure, for it\nmust have been extraordinarily well hidden if the Spaniards never came\nupon it; and I think there can be no doubt whatever that in this\nrespect the traditions must be true. The whole thing would have been\nupset if the Spaniards had once paid a visit there, for, from what we\nsaw at Pachacamac and Cuzco, they spared no exertions whatever to root\nout likely hiding-places. The treasure, if there is one, will be\ndifficult to find, but I have got nearly a year yet, and if necessary I\nwill spend the whole of it in digging. Dias could go and get provisions\nfor us. Of course he must not always go to the same place. Sometimes he\ncan go up to Huaura, sometimes down to Chancay or Ancon. This place, he\nhas told me, lies a mile or two south of the Salinas promontory, which\nwould partly account for its escaping notice, for the road from Huaura,\nas we see on the map, skirts the foot of the hill, and goes straight on\nto Chancay and Ancon, and there is no earthly reason why anyone should\ngo out to the promontory. People here don't leave the roads and travel\neight or ten miles merely to look at the ocean, especially when by\nfollowing the straight line they would see it without trouble. Well, we\nhave both had hard work during the past year, what with felling trees\nto make bridges, chopping logs for fires, making roads practicable by\nmoving rocks out of the way, occasionally using our picks where Dias\nthought that there was a lode, and carrying mules' burdens up and down\nsteep places.\n\n\"Altogether it has been a sort of backwoodsman's life, and if there are\ntreasure-vaults in this place I think we shall be able to get at them,\nhowever thick and heavy the stones may be on the top of them.\"\n\n\"I am game,\" Bertie said. \"There is a lot more excitement in working\nwhen possibly a treasure lies under your feet than in chopping away at\ntrees, some of which are so hard as almost to turn the edge of an axe.\nThe place cannot be very large, so it won't take us very long if we are\nobliged to tear up every foot of it. I suppose there cannot be above\nthree feet of stone over the mouths of any of these vaults.\"\n\n\"I think, Bertie, that when we have once investigated the place and\nsettled on our plans, we had better send Dias and Jose down to Callao\nto get three or four kegs of powder and some boring tools, besides a\nsupply of provisions. We should get on a lot faster with these than\nwith only pickaxes. We shall want a couple of strong iron crowbars for\nlifting slabs of stone, and of course some fuse for the mines.\"\n\n\"We should have to be careful not to put too much powder in, so as not\nto bring the whole thing down about our ears.\"\n\n\"Oh, we should not want to make a mine of that sort, but only to blast\nthe stone as they do in quarries and mines. We should have to make a\nhole to begin with, by means of our picks and crowbars, in one corner\nof the room, two or three feet wide; then we must make a couple of\nholes the size of the boring tool, a foot or so away, according to the\nhardness of the ground, put in charges and fire them, and in that way\nblow down the rock into the hole we had made; and so we should go on\nuntil we had done the whole floor. Of course, the bigger the hole we\nfirst make--that is to say, the wider the face it has--the easier we\nshall blow the stone down afterwards. I have watched them blasting\nstone at Portland, and at some galleries they were making at Gibraltar,\nand I know pretty well how it is done. Of course it is hard work\ndriving the borers down, for that we shall want two or three sledges of\ndifferent weights. It will make our arms ache at first, but after a\nweek or two we shall be able to stick to it fairly well. Now we had\nbetter turn in. We shall start at daybreak tomorrow. It will take us\ntwo hours to reach the spot from which Dias said we could see the\nplace, and another three hours to get to the castle. That will give us\na long afternoon to take our first look over it.\"\n\n\"There, senor,\" Dias said, when at eight o'clock in the morning they\nstopped on a projecting spur of the hill, \"that is the castle!\"\n\nFrom where they stood they could see that the ground fell away into\nwhat was at first a mere depression, but gradually deepened into a\nvalley half a mile wide. Still farther down the sides became more\nprecipitous, and in the distance the valley was closed in by rock\nwalls, and appeared to come to an end. That it did not do so was\nevident from a streak of bright green in the centre of the valley,\nshowing that a small stream must run down it. From the point at which\nthey stood they could see the level line of the plateau near the cliff\nfacing the sea, and on the surface of this a dark zigzag line marked\nthe course of the ravine. Then, when apparently close to the\ntermination of the flat land by the cliffs, the dark streak widened out\nsomewhat. Through a small but powerful telescope which Harry carried he\ncould make out distinctly the upper part of what might be a house.\n\n\"It is a strange-looking place for a castle to be built,\" he said, \"but\nit quite answers to your description, Dias. There are certainly some\nopenings, which may have been windows. I am sure no one looking from\nhere, and ignorant that such a place existed, would notice it, and of\ncourse from the valley it could not be seen at all. Even from this\nheight I do not think I can see more than ten or twelve feet of the\nupper part. But surely it must be noticeable to anyone coming along the\ncliffs?\"\n\n\"It may be, senor, but I cannot say. Certainly no native would go along\nthere even in the daytime. Still, it does seem likely that in the\nSpanish time some must have ridden along the top of the cliffs, and if\nthey had seen the castle it would certainly have been searched.\nAssuredly it has not been so. I have been at Ancon and Salinas many\ntimes, and have talked with the people there. They would never speak on\nthe subject to one of white blood, but knowing that I was of native\nblood, and belonged to one of the families to whom the secret could be\nstrictly trusted, they were ready enough to talk about the Castle of\nDemons. Had the Spaniards ever searched it they would have known, and\nthe place would no longer be feared; but all say that from the time of\nthe conquest by the Spaniards no living being has, as far as is known,\nentered it.\"\n\n\"Then the Incas knew of it, Dias?\"\n\n\"I think so, senor, though I have not heard that any of them ever lived\nthere; but tradition says that the vessel in which a great store of\ntreasure was sent away from Pachacamac, and which, as is proved by\nSpanish writings, was never heard of afterwards, and doubtless was sunk\nin a great storm that came on two or three days after it sailed, was\nintended to be landed and hidden in this castle, which they thought\nmight well escape the observation of the Spaniards.\"\n\n\"And even among your traditions there is no allusion to what became of\nthis treasure ship?\"\n\n\"No, senor; all traditions say that it was never heard of from the day\nit sailed. Had it landed at that castle the secret would have been\nhanded down to some of the native families, just as that of the golden\nvalley and of other hidden treasures has been. But there can be no\ndoubt that the ship was lost with all her treasure.\"\n\n\"Well, we need not talk any more about it now, Dias; we shall learn\nnothing more, however long we stay here and stare at it.\"\n\nThey stopped half an hour for breakfast and then rode down the valley.\nWhen they got near the spot where it closed in Harry saw by the pallor\non the native's face that he was beginning to be greatly alarmed.\n\n\"You had better stop here, Dias. My brother and I will go on and\nexplore this ravine and have a look at the place. We will take some\nropes with us, for the ravine may be blocked by falls of rocks, and we\nmay have to let ourselves down. Evidently the water gets to the sea, or\nthis valley would be a lake like that in the golden ravine, for\nalthough it is but a mere driblet of water now, you can see by the\nbanks that a considerable amount comes down in the wet season. How it\ngets past the castle I don't know; I can only suppose that there is a\npassage for it underneath the building. We will take both our guns,\nBertie, and our pistols. That there are no demons we are quite sure,\nbut the place may have been used as a hiding-place for outlaws and\nbrigands, who could find no better spot, as there was no fear whatever\nof its being discovered. We will take some bread and meat in our\nhaversacks and a flask of spirits. Perhaps we shall be away longer than\nwe expect, Dias, but at any rate we will not stop there after dark.\"\n\nTears were in the Indian's eyes as Harry and Bertie said good-bye to\nhim and started, and when he saw them enter the ravine he sat down with\nhis elbows on his knees and cried unrestrainedly. His wife went up to\nhim and put her hand on his shoulder.\n\n\"Do not sorrow, Dias; as for me, I have no fear, though I love them as\nwell as you do. I do not say that there may not be demons in the\ncastle--everyone says there are;--but though these may strangle our\npeople who break the orders that were given that none should go near, I\ndo not believe they can hurt our white friends. You saw that they had\nno fear; you know how brave they are, and how they laughed at the idea\nof the demons having any power over them. Do you think I could smile\nand talk if I thought they were in danger? Still, as there is no need\nto prepare dinner yet, I will tell my beads over and over again. We\nshall know if any harm comes to them if we hear them fire their guns,\nfor it is certain that they would do so. Even if a legion of demons\nattacked them they would never run away, but would fight till the last.\"\n\n\"I love them,\" Dias said; \"I love them as my own sons. At first, when\nthey came to me from Senor Barriett, it was for his sake that I\nconsented to accompany and aid them; but from that night when they\nsaved my life by rushing, with no weapons save their sticks, into the\nmidst of five men with drawn knives, I felt how noble they were, and I\nloved them not only for the sake of my life, but for their bravery.\nSince then my feelings have grown every day. Have they not treated us\nas equals, as they would do people of their own race--us who, by every\nPeruvian with white blood in his veins, are looked down upon?\"\n\n\"It is true, Dias. They have laughed and joked with us, and have\ntreated me with as much respect as if I had been of pure Spanish blood,\nand have always done everything they could to make things easy for me.\nI will not believe God and the Holy Virgin can permit them to be\noverpowered by the evil ones. Should it be otherwise, should they never\nreturn, I should be inconsolable. It would be to me as if you yourself\nhad died, and I should be ready to stab myself to the heart at the\nthought that we had brought them here.\"\n\n\"I could not live after it either, Maria; but, as you say, I will trust\nthat God will protect them.\"\n\nHe cut down two rods and fastened them together in the form of a cross,\nand then he and his wife knelt before it and repeated innumerable\npaternosters and Ave Marias, crossing themselves as they did so.\n\nJose, as soon as he had removed the burdens from the mules and turned\nthem out to graze at the edge of the streamlet, came and joined them in\ntheir supplications, occasionally breaking off from the repetition of\nthe only prayers he knew, and in his native language imploring the\nsaints to protect their friends.\n\n\"There is no humbug about Dias,\" Bertie said as they left the others.\n\"He is really in a blue funk.\"\n\n\"Yes, he is quite in earnest; and we know that he is no coward in other\nmatters.\"\n\n\"Certainly not. He showed any amount of pluck in the affair with the\nIndians. But he seems such a bright, sensible sort of chap, that it is\nquite funny to hear him going on about his demons. I should not be\nsurprised at anything the ordinary peasant might believe, but it is\ndifferent with a man like Dias.\"\n\n\"You know, Bertie,\" Harry said, coming to a sudden stop, \"I think we\nare making a mistake going on into this ravine. I have no belief that\nthe place is inhabited; still, there may be desperadoes, and perhaps a\nfew fanatics. It is quite possible that a certain number of families\nbound themselves to keep watch here, and formed a little community that\nhas lasted to the present day.\"\n\n\"But how could they have lived?\"\n\n\"We will talk that over, Bertie, if we find any of them there. Now we\nmust turn back. It is not more than a mile at the outside to the place\nwhere we can climb the hillside. In that way we shall be able to look\ndown into this ravine, and take a general view of the place. We shall\nknow what we are doing then, whereas if we were to go on through the\ngorge without knowing anything about it, we might find ourselves caught\nin a trap. It won't make half an hour's difference, for the ground up\nthere will be as good walking as it is here, while we might find all\nsorts of obstacles in this ravine, and with two guns apiece,\nammunition, pistols, coils of rope, food, and so on, we should find it\nawkward work climbing among heaps of rocks.\n\n\"You were saying, How could a group of people exist here for centuries\nwithout any communication with the outside world? Well, I don't suppose\nthey could. They might get water from the stream, and possibly there\nmay be some way of getting down to the sea-shore; anyhow, this stream\nmust find a passage when it is in flood. They might have been able to\nget enough fish for their wants; but a fish-and-water diet would\nscarcely be sufficient.\n\n\"At the same time we are by no means sure that they could have had no\ncommunication with the outside, for just as some families may have been\nordered to live here, others may have been instructed to supply them\nwith food. The watchers may have had a store of gold-dust sufficient to\nlast them all this time, and their friends outside may have brought\nthem a sheep or two, and corn and other articles of necessity once a\nweek. There could have been no difficulty in doing so. The stories of\ndemons, and probably the murder of inquisitive people who tried to pry\ninto what was going on, created such a dread of the place that those in\nthe secret would come and go without the slightest difficulty.\nConceivably, young men may from time to time have gone out for a year\ninto the world and brought back wives with them, or girls may have been\nsent by the people in league with them outside, and obtained husbands,\nwhich is less likely. I should think it was more probable that young\nboys and girls would be kidnapped, and brought in here from time to\ntime. All this is pure guesswork, of course, but nevertheless there may\nbe people here, and it is just as well to take a look round from above\nbefore we trust ourselves inside the place.\"\n\nOn gaining the plateau they followed the crest of the valley until they\ncame to a spot where the ravine appeared to end. They found that in\nfact it made a sharp turn. It was here only some ten feet wide, but\nsoon broadened out to thirty. Fifty yards farther there was another\nsharp bend, the ravine narrowed to twenty feet, and the sides became\nabsolutely perpendicular. Twenty yards farther still they saw something\nlike a wall about thirty or forty feet high stretching across the\ngorge, which was here some seventy feet deep. About twenty feet from\nthe foot there was a steep ascent of rocks, such as might have fallen\nthere by a slip from one side or the other. Above these a perpendicular\nwall rose for another twenty-five feet. Harry and his brother looked at\nit in surprise from the height at which they stood. Its appearance was\nprecisely that of the wall-precipices on each side. It was rough and\nuneven, and they could see no signs of any joints.\n\n\"It looks as if it were natural,\" Bertie said, \"but it can't be.\"\n\n\"No, it must certainly be artificial, but it is a wonderful imitation,\nand certainly anyone coming up the ravine would suppose that bank of\nrocks at the foot had fallen from its face; but we know that it can't\nbe that, for the water makes its way through. Besides, you see it is\nonly three feet wide at the top, and then there is a narrow ledge a\ncouple of feet wide, which was evidently made for the garrison to stand\nupon and shoot their arrows at anyone attempting to come up the ravine.\nBehind the <DW72> is all rough rocks, except just below our feet, where\nthere is a narrow stone staircase of regularly-cut steps. It is so\nnarrow that it could not be noticed by anyone standing here, unless\nthey bent over to look straight down as I am doing. Well, it is just as\nwell that we made the circuit, for we certainly could not have climbed\nover there.\"\n\nAnother sharp turn, and the ravine ran straight towards the castle.\nThey hurried on, and when they had gone fifty yards stood at the edge\nof a roughly circular pit. It was seventy or eighty feet across,\nnarrowing at each end. At one end was the ravine at whose mouth they\nwere standing, and directly opposite, in what might be called the neck\nof the bottle, stood the Castle of the Demons. It was some fifty feet\nin width, and as it stood back about forty feet up the neck it could\nhardly be seen at any point except that at which they were standing.\nThere was no door or other opening at less than some twenty-five feet\nfrom the ground. At that height was a broad aperture about four feet\nhigh and twelve wide. Above this were several smaller openings about\nfour feet square. The singular point in the structure was a rough arch\nof rock, which extended above it and formed its roof. This arch\nprojected thirty or forty feet in front of the building, so that the\nlatter had the appearance of standing in a great cave.\n\n\"What an extraordinary-looking place!\" Bertie said in a low voice.\n\n\"Extraordinary, but how splendidly chosen for concealment! You see the\ntop of the rock above it is level with the ground on either side. This\nwould perfectly well account for people riding along the line of the\ncliffs, and passing over without dreaming that there was a house below\nthem. Even if they went to the edge on this side, they would simply see\nthis deep pit and the ravine beyond, but could not by any possibility\nobtain a sight of the house unless they came round to nearly where we\nare standing, which they could have no possible motive for doing.\nBesides, you see, all the way we have been passing through a thick\nbush; and I have no doubt that in the old time a wood stood here,\npossibly planted by the builders of the house. Of course the arch\nexisted before the house was built. The stratum below was probably\nsofter, and the stream gradually trickled through, and perhaps in some\ngreat flood, when this basin was full, burst its way out, after which\nthe rock gradually fell until it formed that great natural arch.\"\n\n\"Well, let us go round and have a look at the other side.\"\n\nThey found that the width of the arch to the sea cliff was a hundred\nand fifty feet.\n\n\"If the castle extends to this face, Bertie, it is a hundred feet\nacross, but from here we can't see whether it does so. It is probably\nbuilt flush, however, as Dias said that it was not noticeable from the\nsea, and had the arch projected beyond it it could certainly have been\nseen.\"\n\n\"Well, Harry, if you will tie a rope round my waist you can let me\ndown, and I will have a look at it. You can hold me easily enough if\nyou stand twenty feet back from the edge, and you won't have to pull me\nup, because I can easily climb up the rope by myself. I need not go\ndown more than thirty or forty feet, and I can do that easily enough.\"\n\n\"Oh, I could pull you up, Bertie.\"\n\n\"Well, you could do that if by any chance I should get tired; then I\ncould give a shout, and you could haul on the rope.\"\n\n\"There are lots of stumps of trees here, Bertie, and I can take half a\nturn round one of them and so let you down easily; then when you shout\nI will fasten the rope there and come to the edge, and I can hear\nwhether you want me to haul or not. Of course it must depend whether\nthere are any jagged rocks sticking out. If so, it would be better for\nyou to climb, as the rope might chafe against them if I pulled.\"\n\n\"I understand.\" Bertie laid down his weapons and water-flask, made a\nloop at the end of one of the ropes they had brought large enough for\nhim to sit in, then he looked for a spot where the short grass extended\nto the very edge. \"This is a good place, and the rope won't chafe as it\nruns over that. Now I am ready. If you will go back to that stump\nfifteen feet away and let it out gradually, I will be off.\"\n\nHe knelt down, and putting the rope over his head took a firm hold of\nit just above the loop, and then crawled backwards, his brother keeping\nthe rope taut. \"Slack it out gradually now,\" Bertie said; \"I am just\nover.\"\n\nDirectly afterwards his shoulders disappeared. Harry let the rope\nslowly out until he calculated that fifty feet were over the cliff,\nthen he fastened it very securely round the stump and went forward to\nthe edge.\n\n\"Are you all right, Bertie?\" he shouted.\n\n\"Quite right.\"\n\nThe face of the rock was very even, and there was nothing for the rope\nto chafe against. Harry lay down at the edge, keeping a firm hold of\nthe rope to prevent himself from slipping over, and was able to look\ndown on Bertie.\n\n\"Well, Bertie, what is it?\"\n\n\"It is the wall of the house, I have no doubt, but it is so cleverly\nbuilt that I can scarcely see where the arch ends and the house begins.\nLooking quite close I can see where the stones join, but their face has\nbeen left rough; and as it is just the same colour as the rocks, and\nlines have been cut down its face, and cracks made across it answering\nto the lines in the rock on both sides, I am sure I should not have\nknown it was built up unless I had examined it. It is much narrower on\nthis side than on the other--not more than twenty-five feet, I should\nsay. There seem to be some irregularly-shaped holes in what looks like\na fissure in the middle. I suppose they are to light the rooms on this\nside of the house, but they are certainly too small to be noticed from\nthe sea.\"\n\n\"Does the sea come right up to the foot of the cliff?\"\n\nIt was a minute before the answer came. \"The water comes to the foot,\nbut there is a line of rocks running along forty or fifty feet farther\nout. Some of them seem to be thirty feet out of the water; at one end\nthey touch the cliff, and at the other there is a free passage. The\nwater is very clear, but as far as I can judge I should say there is a\ndepth of a fathom or a fathom and a half between the rocks and the\ncliff. Certainly a boat could row in to a position underneath where I\nam.\"\n\n\"Is there anything more?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"You don't see an entrance down here?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"All right! Then you may as well come up again. Can you climb up?\"\n\n\"Easily.\"\n\n\"Well, hail me if you want me to haul.\"\n\nHarry went back to the stump, unwound the rope until it was only half a\nturn round it, and then, holding it firmly, stood ready to haul up.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nINVESTIGATIONS\n\n\nHarry was relieved when, a few minutes later, Bertie's head appeared\nabove the edge, and directly afterwards he crawled over. \"My arms have\nstrengthened ever so much with our work. I could have done it before,\nbut it would have been hard work.\"\n\n\"Well, so far so good, Bertie. There is no doubt that it is one of the\nbest hiding-places in the world, and I am not a bit surprised that the\nSpaniards never found it. Now we will go back to the edge of the ravine\nand have a good look from that side.\"\n\nAs they went along he said, \"Let us have a look at these bushes,\nBertie. The soil is very thin about here, and I wonder that the trees\ngrew.\"\n\n\"These are pines,\" Bertie said, \"and in the mountains we often saw\npines growing among rocks where there did not seem a handful of soil\nfor them.\"\n\nOn examining they found several old stumps, and thrusting a ramrod down\nHarry found, to his surprise, that the soil was from three to four feet\ndeep. He tried again a little farther off, and found that it was two\nfeet; further still, it was only one.\n\n\"The tree must have stood in a hole in the rock,\" he said. \"Try another\none, Bertie.\" The same results were obtained. \"That explains it, Bert.\nEvidently when they planted the trees to prevent this place from being\nseen from the hills, they cut away the rock in circles about twelve\nfeet across and made cup-shaped holes, which they filled up with earth.\nWhen they planted the young trees I dare say at first they watered\nthem. They could easily enough fetch water up from the stream. When the\ntrees got fairly rooted they would be able to leave them alone, perhaps\ngiving them a good watering once every two or three months. Whenever\nthe rains came they would be able to give up watering altogether, for\nin these basins the earth would keep moist for a very long time. It\nwould be a big job, but no doubt the king who built the place had all\nhis tribe at work on it. It is probable that the Incas had established\nthemselves at Cuzco for many years before they came down to this place,\nand the trees may not have been planted till their coming was first\nheard of. In that case there would be plenty of time to hide the place\nbefore they came down and searched the shore. We know that the Chimoos\nresisted them for a considerable time before they were finally\nconquered. Well, for whatever purpose this place was built it is one in\nwhich either the Chimoos or the Incas, if they ever found the place,\nwould be likely to hide treasure, which is satisfactory. Now we will\nsit down here for a short time and watch both windows. You look at the\ntwo top lines, Bertie, and I will look at the two lower lines. I\ncertainly do not see any signs of life. That is how the water gets\nout,\" and he pointed to a roughly-shaped arch about twelve feet wide\nand as many high. Through this the little stream disappeared. \"I expect\nthere is a similar passage at the other end.\"\n\n\"There may have been,\" Bertie said. \"I was hanging so close to the wall\nthat there may very well have been one without my being able to see it.\nBut it looks pitch-dark in there. If there were much of an opening we\nought to see the light, for, as we agreed, it can't be more than a\nhundred feet long.\"\n\n[Illustration: HARRY DROPPED THE BARREL OF HIS RIFLE INTO THE PALM OF\nHIS LEFT HAND.]\n\n\"That is the first place we will investigate, Bertie. The question of\nhow we are to get into the house wants some thinking over. That lowest\nwindow is a good twenty-five feet above the ground.\"\n\n\"Of course if we had a grapnel we could fasten it to the end of a rope\nand chuck it in.\"\n\n\"We shall have to make something of that sort. If the window had been\non the other side instead of this it would have been easy enough,\nbecause I could have lowered you and slipped down the rope afterwards,\nbut that arch sticking out so far on this side makes it impossible. All\nthat we can do now is, as far as I can see, to lower ourselves down on\nto the top of that wall in the ravine, then go and examine the tunnel.\nWe have got plenty of rope to lower ourselves from here on to the wall.\"\n\nThey watched the building for another twenty minutes. \"I am convinced\nthat no one is there,\" Harry said. \"I have not seen as much as a shadow\npass any of the windows since. If people did live in it they would\nnaturally be on this side of the house, because the rooms here are\nbetter lighted and more cheerful, and no doubt they are the principal\nrooms, as the house narrows so much at the other end.\"\n\n\"Well, let us try it,\" Bertie said. \"If there is a strong force here we\nshould only have to make a bolt back to that narrow staircase. We could\nhold that against a whole tribe.\"\n\nThey rose and walked along the edge of the ravine till they were above\nthe wall, then, fastening the rope to a stump, they slid down on to it.\n\n\"So far so good,\" Harry said, as, holding their rifles in their hands,\nthey went down the steps. Then he suddenly stopped. \"Hullo,\" he\nexclaimed, \"here are two skeletons!\"\n\nThey were not quite skeletons, for the bones were covered by a\nparchment-like skin, and there were still remains of the short skirt\neach had worn in life. A spear lay beside each. With difficulty the\nbrothers passed down without treading upon them.\n\n\"They must have been here a long time, Harry,\" Bertie said when they\ngot to the bottom.\n\n\"Any time,\" the other said. \"In the dry air of these low lands there is\nscarce any decay. You remember those mummies we saw. I believe iron or\nsteel will lie here for years without rusting. They may have been here\nfor a couple of hundred years or more.\"\n\n\"I wonder what killed them, Harry?\"\n\n\"I have no idea. You see, one was lying almost on the other with his\narms round his body, as if he had died trying to lift him up. If they\nhad been shot by arrows they would still be sticking into them; if they\nhad been killed by people pursuing them they would probably be lying\nupon their backs, for they would naturally have faced round at the last\nmoment to resist their pursuers, whereas there are no signs of injury.\nThis settles the point that there is no one in the house. Had it been\ninhabited, the bodies would have been removed from the path, for it is\nby this that people would go out and return. There may have been a\nladder down from the wall; the only other way they could have got out\nwould have been through that passage to the sea. A boat may have been\nkept there; but even if that had been so, we should scarcely have found\nthose bodies on the steps. Well, we shall have plenty of time to talk\nover that.\"\n\nThey walked across the open space until they approached the building.\nFor a height of twenty feet it was constructed of stone, above that it\nappeared to be made of the great adobe bricks which had been so largely\nused at Pachacamac, and in others of the old ruins they had seen.\n\n\"There is no question that it must have been built by the Chimoos or\nsome race before them,\" Harry said; \"the Incas could have had no\npossible reason for erecting such a place. Well, now for the tunnel.\"\n\nThe little stream only occupied two feet of the passage. They were\ntherefore enabled to walk down dry-foot.\n\n\"We ought to have brought a torch with us,\" Bertie said.\n\n\"I don't think we shall want that; there is a sort of thin blue light,\nthe reflection of the light upon the water outside, though I don't know\nwhy it should be so blue.\"\n\nThe reason was soon manifest. The passage sloped downwards, and when\nthey had gone some fifty feet their progress was arrested by water\nwhich appeared of a deep-blue colour.\n\n\"That is it,\" Harry said. \"You see the roof comes down into the water\ntwenty feet off, and the light has come up under it. They sloped this\npassage to make the water flow out below the surface of the sea, so\nthat the opening could not be seen from without. By the light I should\nnot say that the opening is more than six inches under the water. I\ndon't know how the tides are, but if it is high tide now, the top of\nthe opening would be eighteen inches out of water at low tide, for, as\nyou know, the tide only rises about two feet on this coast. In that\ncase a boat would be able to come in and out at low tide, but of course\na man wanting to come in or go out could easily dive under at any time.\nWell, that settles that point for the present. It was a clever plan;\nany amount of water could flow out in flood time, and yet no one who\ntook the trouble to come behind that ledge of rocks we saw would have\nany idea that there was an opening. I think now that we had better go\nback, Bertie; in the first place because we can do nothing until we\nhave manufactured a grapnel of some sort, and in the next place because\nevery moment we delay will add to the anxiety of our friends in camp.\nWe must have been away three hours, I should say.\"\n\nThey ascended the steps, fastened the short rope round a block at the\ntop of the wall across the ravine, and lowered themselves down. They\nhad to proceed with great care while making their way down the <DW72>\ncomposed of rough and jagged rocks, Once at the bottom of the ravine,\nhowever, they walked briskly on. They had scarcely issued from the\nentrance when they saw a stir in the camp in the distance and heard a\nshout of delight, and then Dias dashed off to meet them at the top of\nhis speed.\n\n\"Thanks to all the saints, senor, that you are safe! You do not know\nhow we have suffered. We have prayed ever since you started, all of us.\nOnce or twice I threw myself down in despair, but Maria chided me for\nhaving so little faith in God to keep you from evil, and cheered me by\nsaying that had harm come to you we should assuredly have heard the\nsound of your guns. Have you been in the castle?\"\n\n\"No, Dias, we have not been in--for the good reason that we could not\nget in, because the only entrance is fully twenty-five feet from the\nground. We cannot enter until we have made some contrivance by which a\nrope can be fixed there, or manufactured a ladder, which would be the\nbest way and save a lot of trouble, if we could get a couple of poles\nlong enough. We thought that we would come back when we had seen all\nthere was to be seen outside the place.\"\n\nThe Indian's face fell. \"Then you do not know what is in the house,\nsenor?\"\n\n\"No; but we are certain that there is no one there, and that probably\nno one has been there for the past two hundred years, and perhaps a\ngood deal longer.\"\n\n\"And the demons have not interfered with you?\"\n\n\"The demons knew better,\" Bertie laughed.\n\n\"They may not be powerful in the daytime,\" Dias said in an awed tone.\n\"It is at night that they would be terrible.\"\n\n\"Well, Dias,\" Bertie said, \"everyone knows that the demons cannot\nwithstand the sign of the cross. All you have to do is to make a small\ncross, hold it up in front of you and say, '_Vade retro, Satanas!_' and\nthey will fly howling away.\"\n\n\"Seriously,\" Harry said, \"you know it is all bosh about demons, Dias.\"\n\n\"But the church exorcises evil spirits. I have seen a priest go with\ncandles and incense to a haunted house, and drive out the evil spirits\nthere.\"\n\n\"That is to say, Dias, no spirits were ever seen there afterwards, and\nwe may be very certain that no spirits were ever seen there before,\nthough cowardly people might have fancied they saw them. However,\nto-morrow we shall get inside, and Bertie and I will stop there all\nnight, and if we neither see nor hear anything of them you may be quite\nsure that there are none there.\"\n\n\"But the traditions say they have strangled many and torn them, senor;\ntheir bodies have been found in the daytime and carried off.\"\n\n\"It is quite possible that they were strangled and torn there, but you\nmay be sure that it was the work not of demons, but of the men who were\nset to guard the place from intruders. Well, those men have gone. We\nfound two skeletons, which must have been there at least a hundred\nyears, perhaps a great deal more. They were lying on the stairs, the\nonly way of getting into the place, and they would have been removed\nlong ago if anyone had been passing in or out.\"\n\nBy this time they had arrived at the camp. \"I knew you would come back\nall safe, senors,\" Donna Maria said triumphantly; \"I told Dias so over\nand over again. But what have you seen?\"\n\n\"I see something now--or rather I don't see something now that I should\nlike to see,\" Bertie laughed. \"I thought you would have got a good\ndinner ready for me, but I do not see any signs of its being even\nbegun.\"\n\nThe woman laughed. \"I have been too busy praying, senor, and have been\nkeeping up Dias's spirits. I never knew him faint-hearted before, and\nit really almost frightened me; but I will set about getting dinner at\nonce.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" Harry said; \"we are really not hungry. We had a good meal\nbefore we started. So do you three sit down and I will tell you all we\nhave seen.\"\n\nThe three natives listened with intense interest. When he had done,\nMaria clapped her hands. \"It must be a wonderful place,\" she said. \"I\nwish I had gone with you, I will go to-morrow if you will take me.\"\n\n\"Certainly we will take you, Maria; and I have no doubt that Dias will\ngo too.\"\n\n\"I will go as far as the place,\" said Dias, \"but I will not promise to\ngo in.\"\n\n\"I won't press you, Dias. When we have slept there a night I have no\ndoubt you will become convinced that it is quite safe. And now about\nthe ladder. We shall really want two to be comfortable--one for getting\nup to the window, that must be made of wood; the other, which will be\nused for getting up and down the wall in the ravine, may be made of\nropes. But I think that that had best be hung from the top of the\nravine above it, so as to avoid having to climb over those rough stones\nat the foot, which are really very awkward. One might very well twist\none's ankle among them.\"\n\n\"I will go at once, senor, and get the poles,\" Dias said. \"You may as\nwell come with me, Jose. We passed a wood in the valley about five\nmiles off; there we can cut down a couple of young trees. If we put the\nsaddles on two of the riding mules, when we have got the poles clear we\ncan fasten the ends to ropes and trail them behind us.\"\n\n\"We shall also want some of the branches you cut off, Dias. You had\nbetter say thirty lengths of about two feet long, so that we may place\nthe rungs nine inches apart. You had better get poles thirty feet long,\nfor we may not have just the height by a couple of feet.\"\n\nThe two natives at once rode off, and the brothers set to work to\ncollect sticks for the fire.\n\n\"It is too bad, senors, that this should not have been done while you\nwere away, but we thought of nothing but your danger.\"\n\n\"You were perfectly right, Maria; if we were in peril, you did the best\nthing of all to obtain help for us. As to the dinner, there is no hurry\nwhatever for it. What have you got to eat?\"\n\n\"There is nothing, senor, but a few of the fish we fried two days ago,\nand the ham that we smoked of that bear.\"\n\n\"I will take the line, then, and go down and try to catch some fresh\nfish,\" Bertie said. \"There is a good-sized pool about half-way between\nhere and the ravine. I might get some fish there.\"\n\n\"I will take my gun, Bertie, and go up to the bushes by the ravine, and\nsee if I can get a bird or two. There is no other shelter anywhere\nabout here.\"\n\nIn half an hour the lad brought a dozen fish into the camp. None of\nthem were above half a pound, but they were nearly of a size.\n\n\"These will be very nice,\" the woman said with a smile as he handed\nthem to her. \"I have thrown away the others. I do not think we dried\nthem enough; they were certainly going bad. I have heard your brother\nfire several times, and as he does not often miss, I have no doubt he\nwill bring us something.\"\n\nTwenty minutes later Harry was seen coming along. When he arrived he\nthrew down a large bunch of wild pigeons.\n\n\"There are ten brace,\" he said. \"That will give us four apiece. I found\nnothing in the bushes, but I suddenly remembered that when we went\nacross from the ravine to the house, lots of wild pigeons rose from the\nsides of the rocks. We did not give them a thought at the time, our\nattention being fixed upon the building. But when I got nothing above,\nI suddenly remembered them, and concluded that they had their nests in\nthe crannies of the rocks. So I walked along to the top, and as I did\nso numbers of them flew up. I shot a couple; most of the others soon\nsettled again, but some kept flying round and round, and in ten minutes\nI got as many as I wanted. Then of course I had to go down into the\nravine by the rope and the steps to gather them up. I returned the way\nwe did, by the rope we had left hanging from the top of the wall.\"\n\nMaria was already at work on the birds. Taking them by the legs, she\ndipped them for a minute into a pot of boiling water, and as she took\nthem out Bertie pulled off the feathers. Then she cut off the heads and\nfeet, cleaned them, and spitted them on Jose's ramrod, and, raking out\na line of embers from the fire, laid the ends of the ramrod on two\nforked twigs while she attended to the fish.\n\n\"But they will be done before the others arrive,\" Bertie said.\n\n\"No, senor; there they come! They will be here in a quarter of an hour.\nThe cakes are ready and hot, so we will lay the pigeons on them, and\nthey will be nicely flavoured by the time that we have eaten the fish\nand are ready for them.\"\n\nDias and Jose soon arrived at a gallop, with the long poles trailing\nbehind them and a fagot of short sticks fastened to each saddle.\n\n\"Those are capital poles, Dias,\" Harry said as he examined\nthem--\"strong enough for anything. We will chop notches in them for the\nrungs to lie in. There will be no fear then of their shifting, which\nthey might do if the lashings stretched. Now, we have got a capital\ndinner just done to a turn, so you see we have not been lazy while you\nwere away.\n\n\"You see,\" he said, after they had finished breakfast, \"my shooting has\nquite settled the point that no Indians are in the castle. If there had\nbeen they would certainly have come to the windows to see who was\nfiring. I kept an eye on the castle between each shot, and saw no signs\nof any movement. It is a capital thing that so many pigeons live among\nthe rocks. If we content ourselves with say five brace a day, they will\nlast us a long time, and will be a change from salt and dried meat,\nwhich we should otherwise have to depend upon, for we cannot be sending\naway for fresh meat two or three times a week. We can get fish, though\nI don't suppose that will last very long, for the pool will soon be\nfished out, and I don't think that there is water enough in other\nplaces for fish of that size.\"\n\n\"We can get them from the sea, Harry. We have got plenty of large hooks\nand lines, which we used on the other side of the mountains. If any of\nthe window openings on that side are large enough, we can let down the\nlines from there. If not, we can do it from the top where I went down.\"\n\n\"I should not like that,\" Harry said. \"One might slip on that short\ngrass.\"\n\n\"Well, one could dive out through the passage and sit on that ledge of\nrocks, and fish either inside them or in the sea outside.\"\n\n\"Yes, we might do that, Bertie, and certainly it would be a first-rate\nthing if we could get plenty of fish. It would keep us in good health\nand make a nice change. I think to-morrow morning, Dias, we had better\nfix our camp close up to the mouth of the ravine. Out here in the open\nvalley we can be seen from the hills, and if anyone caught sight of the\nanimals, it would very soon get talked about, and we should have a\nparty down here to see who we were and what we were about.\"\n\n\"Yes, senor, that would be much better. I should not have liked to go\nnearer this morning; but now that you have been there twice, and have\nreturned safely, I am ready to move.\"\n\n\"It would certainly be better; besides, it would save us a couple of\nmiles' walk each time we wanted a meal. However, when we once set to\nwork I have no doubt we shall establish ourselves in the castle. Of\ncourse one of us will come down morning and evening to see to the\nanimals.\"\n\nAs soon as the meal was finished they set to work to make the ladder. A\nshort stick was cut as a guide to the space that was to be left between\nthe rungs. Bertie and Jose marked off the distances on the two poles,\nand Dias and Harry with their axes cut the grooves in which the sticks\nwere to lie. Then the poles were laid a foot apart, and the work of\npressing the sticks into their places began. They agreed that the ropes\nshould not be cut up, as they would be wanted for fastening on the\nloads whenever the mules went to fetch food or powder. Two of the\nhead-ropes were used on each side, and a firm job was made.\n\n\"When you go, Dias, for the powder and so on, you must get another\nsupply of rope. We shall want a longer ladder than this in the ravine,\nand also a rope to lift powder and firewood and so on into the castle,\nand perhaps for other things that one does not think of at present.\nTomorrow we will unfasten the cord by which we descended to the wall,\nas we shall not want to use that in future. I think to-morrow, when we\ngo to the castle, as you and Jose do not mean to accompany us, you\nmight take your axes and cut down a lot of those stumps among the\nbrushwood, split them up, and pitch them into the courtyard of the\ncastle. It would be well to lay in a good stock of firewood. We shall\nwant it for cooking and lighting of an evening. We have only one or two\ntorches left, and we shall want a cheerful fire.\"\n\n\"I may go with you to-morrow, may I not?\" Maria said.\n\n\"Certainly you may, if you wish.\"\n\n\"I should like to,\" she said. \"In your company I sha'n't be a bit\nafraid of demons; and I want to see the place.\"\n\n\"That is right, Maria, and it shows at any rate that your curiosity is\nstronger than your superstition.\"\n\n\"If Maria goes I will go,\" Dias said. \"I don't like it; but if she went\nand I didn't I should never hear the last of it.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" Harry said with a laugh, \"I do think she would have the\nbetter of you in the future if you didn't. So you see you will be both\nconquering your superstitions--she, because her curiosity is greater;\nyou, because you are more afraid of her tongue than you are of the\ndemons.\"\n\n\"A woman never forgets, senor; if she once has something to throw up in\na man's teeth it comes out whenever she is angry.\"\n\n\"I suppose so, Dias. Bertie and I have had no experience that way, but\nwe will take your word for it.\"\n\nThe next morning they moved the mules and all their belongings to the\nextreme end of the valley. Then they had an early breakfast. Jose took\nup his axe and the others their arms; the former turned back for the\npoint where he could climb the hill. Dias and Harry took the heavy end\nof the ladder, Bertie the light one, and they started up the ravine.\nMaria followed with a store of bread that she had baked the day before.\nIt was hard work carrying the ladder up the rocks at the foot of the\nwall. When it was securely fastened there, they mounted and dragged it\nup to them.\n\nWhen they came out into the open space there was a pause. \"It is, as\nyou said, a strange place, senor.\"\n\n\"It is, Dias, an extraordinary place; and if the people who built it\nwanted, as I suppose they did, to avoid observation, they could not\nhave chosen a better. When those trees were growing it would have been\nimpossible to catch sight of them without coming down the ravine.\"\n\n\"It looks very still,\" Dias said in a doubtful voice.\n\n\"That is generally the case when a place is empty, Dias, Now let us go\non at once and get the ladder up.\"\n\nAs soon as the ladder was in position Harry mounted, closely followed\nby Bertie. Dias hesitated; but a merry laugh from his wife settled the\npoint, and he followed with an expression of grave determination on his\nface. As soon as he was on the ladder his wife followed him with a\nlight step.\n\nAs Harry reached the top, he found that the sill of the window was two\nfeet and a half above the floor of the apartment. He stepped down and\nthen looked round. The room occupied the whole width of the house, and\nwas some twenty feet wide. Four rows of pillars ran across it,\nsupporting the roof above. The ends of the room were in semi-darkness.\nIt was not above ten feet in height. There were rude carvings on the\npillars and the walls.\n\nBy the time he had made these observations the others had joined him.\n\"I see people there,\" Dias said, in an awed voice, pointing to one end\nof the room. Harry dropped the barrel of his rifle into the palm of his\nleft hand. After gazing two seconds he placed it on his shoulder,\nsaying, \"There are people, Dias, but they won't do us any harm;\" and he\nwalked in that direction. Two figures lay on the ground; four others\nwere in a sitting position, close to each other, against the end wall.\nSome bows and arrows and spears lay near them. All were dressed in a\ngarment of rough cloth. Harry walked up to one and touched it on the\nhead with the muzzle of his gun.  As he did so it crumbled away; the\nbones rattled on the stone floor as they fell. Donna Maria gave a\nlittle cry.\n\n\"They are dead!\" she exclaimed. \"They must have been dead years and\nyears ago.\"\n\n\"Two or three hundred, I should think. Your legends are evidently true,\nDias. There was a party left here to keep strangers from entering this\nplace. Now, before we go farther, let us think this out. We will sit\ndown on the ledge of the window. But before we do so, take a good look\nat their arms and skulls, Dias. You have often been with travellers to\nthe ruins; let us hear what you say.\"\n\nDias, who was now assured that he had only to deal with human beings,\nexamined them carefully, looking at the ornaments that still hung round\ntheir necks, and then said: \"They are not the old people, senor; these\nwere Incas.\"\n\n\"That is an important point; now let us see how this is to be\nexplained. Now,\" he said, as they sat down, \"it is clear that the Incas\ndid know this building. They may have discovered treasures here or they\nmay not; but it would certainly seem that they were as anxious as the\nChimoos had been to keep its existence a secret, and it is certain that\nthey must have had some interest in doing so. We have reason to believe\nthat the Spaniards at least did not know of it. There is no doubt\nwhatever that these men were not killed in fight; on the contrary,\ntheir sitting position proves that they died quietly, and probably at\nthe same time. We see no signs of food; we may find some as we search\nthe place. If we do not, we must take it that they either died from an\noutbreak of some epidemic or from hunger. And it is quite probable that\nthe two skeletons on the steps were two of their companions who were\ngoing out to seek for food, and that they fell from weakness; one\nclearly died in the act of trying to lift the other. What do you think\nof that, Dias?\"\n\n\"I think that what you say is likely. But why should they have died\nfrom hunger?\"\n\n\"It is probable that others were in the secret, and were in the habit\nof bringing provisions to them, and perhaps of relieving them at\ncertain periods. We know that there were fierce battles in the early\ntimes of the Spaniards. In one of these battles the whole of those who\nwere acquainted with the secret may have fallen. Or it may have been\nearlier after the conquest had been completed, when the Spaniards drove\ntens of thousands of men to work as slaves in the mines. The people\nhere may have remained at their post, hoping for relief until it was\ntoo late. Two of the strongest may have started at last, but have been\ntoo weak to climb the steps, and died there. Their comrades may have\nnever known their fate, but have sat down to die here, as you see. I\nshould think it probable that the second of my suggestions is likely to\nbe the right one, and that this did not take place until perhaps a\nhundred years after the arrival of the Spaniards, otherwise those\nlegends of men who came near this place being killed would never have\nbeen handed down. If all this is as I suggest, either the Incas knew\nthat the Chimoos had buried treasure here, or they themselves buried\nsome, although, as you say, there is no tradition of treasure having\nbeen taken here. But it is possible that that treasure ship, which\nundoubtedly sailed from some place along the coast and was never again\nheard of, really came here; that her treasure was landed, and the\nvessel then destroyed. In either case, there is strong reason for hope\nthat there is treasure somewhere in this castle if we can but find it.\"\n\n\"We will find it,\" Bertie said confidently. \"What you say must be true.\nThese Indians would never have been fools enough to sit here and die\nwithout some good reason for it. Well, I vote that before we do\nanything else we clear these bones out.\"\n\n\"We can do that the first thing to-morrow morning, Bertie. We can't\njust throw them out of the window. The bones are of men who died doing\ntheir duty to their country. We will leave them as they are to-day, and\nto-morrow we will bring up one of the big leather bags, place the bones\nin it, and take them down into the valley and bury them.\"\n\n\"Then you won't sleep here to-night, Harry?\"\n\n\"No; I have not a shadow of superstition, but I do not think it would\nbe lively here with those things at the end of the room. Now, let us\nlook about a bit.\n\n\"This was evidently the great hall of the place; do you not think so,\nDias?\"\n\n\"Yes, senor; the house gets narrower as it nears the sea. This is by\nfar the best lighted room on this side. No doubt the rooms on this\nfloor were the abode of the chief who built it, and his principal\nfollowers; the others would be above.\"\n\n\"Well, we will light the two torches. Yes, there is no doubt that this\nwas the room. You see there are brackets against all the pillars for\nholding torches. Before we go farther we will see what they are made\nof.\"\n\nHe took his knife out of his pocket and went up to one of the brackets,\nwhich consisted of bars of metal an inch and a half square and eighteen\ninches long. They widened out at the end, and here was a round hole\nabout two inches in diameter, evidently intended to put the torch in.\nThe metal was black with age. He scraped a few inches off one of them\nwith his knife. \"Silver!\" he exclaimed. \"It would have been better if\nthey had been gold. But as there are four on each pillar, and twelve\npillars, they would make a tidy weight. That is a good beginning,\nBertie. If they are the same in all the rooms there would be several\ntons of it.\"\n\nThere was but one door to the room; through this they passed. Dias, now\nthat there was some explanation for what he considered the work of the\ndemons, had a more assured air. One passage led straight on; two others\nran parallel to the wall of the room they had left.\n\n\"We will examine these first,\" Harry said. \"It is likely enough they\nlead to the stairs to the lower room. There must be two floors below\nus, one above the level of the top of the tunnel, the other below that\nmust be divided in two by it.\"\n\nAs they advanced into the passage there was a strange and sudden\nclamour, a roaring sound mingled with sharp shrieks and strange little\npiping squeaks. Maria ran back with a shriek of alarm, and there was a\nstrange rush overhead. The torches were both extinguished, and Harry\nand his brother discharged their rifles almost at the same moment. Dias\nburst into a shout of laughter as they both dropped their weapons and\nswung their double-barrelled guns forward. \"What on earth is it, Dias?\"\n\n\"It is bats and birds, senor. I have seen them come out of caves that\nway many times. I dare say the place is full of bats. The birds would\nonly come into rooms where there is some light.\"\n\nTurning round they saw quite a cloud of bats flying out through the\ndoor.\n\n\"Confound it!\" Harry said. \"They have given me the worst fright I ever\nhad in my life.\"\n\nThey went back to the room, they had left. Both Harry and Bertie had\nlost every tinge of colour from their faces.\n\n\"I am very glad, Harry,\" Bertie said, with an attempt at a laugh, \"that\nyou were frightened. I was scared almost out of my life.\"\n\nMaria had thrown herself down on her face.\n\n\"Ah, senors,\" Dias said triumphantly, \"you thought they were demons!\"\n\n\"I did not think they were demons, Dias, but what they were I could not\ntell you. I never heard any such sound before. I am not ashamed to say\nthat I did feel badly frightened. Now, see to your wife, Dias.\"\n\n\"There is nothing to be afraid of, Maria. What are you lying there for?\"\n\nThe woman raised herself slightly. \"Are you alive?\" she said in a dazed\nway.\n\n\"Alive? of course I am! You don't suppose I am going to be frightened\nat a lot of bats? There, look at them, they are still streaming out.\"\n\n\"It is all right, Maria,\" Harry said. \"You have had a fright; and so\nhave Bertie and I, so you need not be ashamed of yourself. It is all\nvery well for Dias to laugh, but he says he has seen such things\nbefore.\"\n\n\"If you were afraid, senor, I need not be ashamed that I was; I really\ndid think it was the demons.\"\n\n\"There is no such thing, Maria; but it was as good an imitation of them\nas you are ever likely to see.\"\n\n\"I was in a horrible funk, Maria,\" Bertie said, \"and I am only just\ngetting over it; I feel I am quite as pale as you. What are you looking\nso pleased about, Dias?\" he asked almost angrily.\n\n\"I am pleased, senor, now I have got even with Maria. The first time\nshe says to me 'demons', I shall say to her 'bats'.\"\n\n\"Now, let us start again,\" Harry said as they all laughed. \"But instead\nof going down, we will go upstairs. I have not pulled myself quite\ntogether yet, and I don't suppose you have.\"\n\n\"No, my knees are quite wobbling about, and if I saw anything, I\ncertainly could not aim straight just at present. And it's rum; we had\nthe main-mast struck by lightning off the Cape one voyage I made, and I\ndid not feel a bit like this.\"\n\n\"I dare say not, Bertie. We all feel brave in dangers that we are\naccustomed to; it is what we don't know that frightens us. We will sit\nhere on the window-sill for another five minutes before we move again.\nJose, you have got some pulque in your gourd, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Yes, senor.\"\n\n\"Then we will all take a drink of it. I don't like the stuff, but just\nat present I feel that it won't come amiss at all.\"\n\nSome of the spirit was poured into a tin mug they had with them, and\nmixed with water, with which they had filled their water-bottles from\nthe stream before starting.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nTHE SEARCH BEGINS\n\n\nIn a few minutes all were ready to go on again. Harry had asked Maria\nif she would like to go down the ladder and wait till they returned.\n\n\"No, senor, I should not like it at all. I don't care how full of bats\nthe rooms are, now that I know what they are. As for Dias, I have no\ndoubt that the first time he heard them he was just as frightened.\"\n\n\"No, I was not; but I dare say I should have been if the man I was\nwith--I was then only about Jose's age--had not told me that the cavern\nwas full of bats. There was a great storm coming on, and he proposed\nthat we should take shelter there. We brought the mules into the mouth\nof the cave, and he said, 'Now, we will light a torch and go in a bit\nfarther, and then you will be astonished. It is a bat cavern, and I\nhave no doubt there are thousands of them here. They won't hurt us,\nthough they may knock out our torch, and the noise they make is enough\nto scare one out of one's senses, if one does not know what it is.'\nThough I did know, I own I was frightened a bit; but since then I have\nbeen into several such caves, so I knew in a moment what it was. I\nought to have warned the senors, for an old house like this, where\nthere is very little light, is just the place for them.\"\n\n\"But there were birds too, Dias.\"\n\n\"Yes, I expect they were nearer. Perhaps some of them were in the other\nrooms, where they would be close to the openings. But they were\nprobably scared too by the noise of the bats, and as the windows behind\nwere too small for them all to fly out together, they made for the\nlight instead.\"\n\n\"Well, now, let us start,\" Harry said, getting up.  They again lit\ntheir torches, and this time found everything perfectly quiet in the\npassage. Two or three yards beyond the spot at which they had before\narrived they saw a staircase to the left. It was faintly lighted from\nabove, and, mounting it, they found themselves in a room extending over\nthe whole width and depth of the house. The roof at the eastern end was\nnot supported by pillars, but by walls three feet wide and seven or\neight feet apart. The first line of these was evidently over the wall\nof the room they had left. There were four lines of similar supports\nerected, they had no doubt, over the walls of rooms below. The light\nfrom the four windows in front, and from an irregular opening at the\nother end some three feet high and six inches wide, afforded sufficient\nlight for them to move about without difficulty. There were many signs\nof human habitation here. Along the sides were the remains of mats,\nwhich had apparently divided spaces six feet wide into small\napartments. Turning these over they found many trifles--arrow-heads,\nbead-necklaces, fragments of pots, and even a child's doll.\n\n\"I expect this is the room where the married troops lived and slept,\"\nHarry said; \"there is not much to see here.\"\n\nThe two stories above were exactly similar, except that there were no\nremains of dividing mats nor of female ornaments. They walked to the\nnarrow end. Here the opening for light was of a different shape from\nthose in the rooms below. It had apparently been originally of the same\nshape, but had been altered. In the middle it was, like the others,\nthree feet high and six inches wide, but a foot from the bottom there\nwas a wide cut, a foot high and three feet wide. As they approached it\nDias gave an exclamation of surprise. Two skeletons lay below it. \"They\nmust have been on watch here, senor, when they died,\" he said as they\ncame up to them.\n\n\"It is a rum place to watch,\" Bertie said, \"for you cannot see out.\"\n\n\"You are right, Bertie, it is a curious hole.\"\n\nThe wall was over two feet thick; all the other openings had been\ndriven straight through it, and, as they had noticed, were doubtless\nmade in the stones before they were placed there, for inside they were\ncleanly cut, and it was only within three inches of the outer face that\nthe edges had been left rough. This opening was of quite a different\ncharacter. It sloped at a sharp angle, and no view of the open sea\ncould be obtained, but only one of the line of rocks at the foot of the\ncliffs. It was roughly made, and by the marks of tools, probably of\nhardened copper, it had evidently been cut from the inside.\n\nHarry stood looking for some time. \"I cannot understand their cutting\nthe hole like this. It could not be noticed from the sea that there was\nan opening at all; that is plain enough. But why make the hole at all\nwhen you can see nothing from it? And yet a watch has been placed here,\nwhile there was none at the other places where they could make out any\npassing ship.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" Bertie said, \"it was done in order that if from the other\nplaces boats were seen approaching, they could chuck big stones down\nfrom here and sink any boat that might row inside the rocks into the\nentrance to the passage, which, as this is in the middle of the room,\nmust be just under us.\"\n\n\"In that case they would have kept a supply of big stones here. I have\nno doubt whatever that it was made some time after the castle was\nbuilt, and I should say, judging by its unfinished state, the work was\ndone in haste. But what for, goodness only knows. Well now, having made\nno discoveries whatever on the upper floor, we will go down. It is\ncertain that there can be no great treasure hidden under any of these\nfloors, there is not depth enough for hiding-places. I counted the\nsteps as we came upstairs, and there cannot be much more than two feet\nbetween the floor of one room and the ceiling in the next. I fancy that\nthis is of single stones, each the flooring length of the space between\nthe half-walls. You see that there is a long beam of stone running on\nthe top of the dividing wall, and the ends of these stones appear to\nrest on it. It is below that we must look for hiding-places.\"\n\nThey descended to the first floor. They found that the space behind the\ngreat room was divided into a number of chambers. All of these, with\nthe exception of the small one on the sea-face, were necessarily in\nabsolute darkness, and in all were brackets for torches, similar to\nthose in the principal chamber. Bertie counted them, and found that,\nincluding those first met with, they numbered one hundred and\ntwenty-three.\n\n\"How much do you think they weigh apiece?\" he asked Harry when the tour\nwas finished.\n\n\"I have not the slightest idea, Bertie. I should think about fifteen\npounds, but it may be five pounds less than that. They would certainly\ngive a very nasty knock on the head.\"\n\n\"Oh, I was not thinking of knocks on the head. If there are a hundred\nbars at fifteen pounds apiece, it is a big amount of silver; if they\nare only ten pounds each--and really I think that is nearer the\nmark--they weigh a thousand pounds. What is silver worth a pound?\"\n\n\"It varies. You can put it at five shillings an ounce; that would be\nthree pounds sterling for one of silver--three thousand pounds in a\nrough calculation for the lot.\"\n\n\"Well, that is not a bad beginning, Harry; it would pay all the\nexpenses and leave a couple of thousand over.\"\n\nHarry shrugged his shoulders. \"A drop in the ocean as far as I am\nconcerned, Bertie. Still, it is a beginning; and you may be sure that\nthey did not take all this trouble to guard this castle for the sake of\nthree thousand pounds' worth of silver.\"\n\nThey now went down to the next floor. Here there were two staircases,\nand the space was divided into two parts by a wall along the centre.\nThere were no openings whatever for light. One half had evidently been\ndevoted to arms. Here still lay hundreds of spear-shafts, tens of\nthousands of arrows, piles of hide shields, and caps of the same\nmaterial.\n\n\"This store must have been larger than was required for the garrison of\nthe place,\" Harry said, \"it must have been a reserve for re-arming a\nwhole tribe.\"\n\nBesides the arms there were great bales of rough cloth and piles of\nskins, all in a marvellous state of preservation owing to the dryness\nof the air. After thoroughly examining the room they went up the stairs\nleading into it and descended those into the adjoining chamber. This\nwas divided into compartments by transverse walls four feet shorter\nthan the width, thereby leaving a passage through from end to end. Here\nin confusion--for the most part turned inside out--were sacks of\nmatting and bags of leather. One of the compartments was filled with\ngreat jars arranged in tiers. Some of the compartments were quite empty.\n\n\"I think, senor, that these were stores of loose grain, probably maize.\nI do not see a single grain left.\"\n\nThey looked carefully round with the torches. \"This carries out our\nidea, Dias, that the people upstairs died of hunger. I have no doubt,\nas you say, that the sacks did contain grain. If these had been cleared\nin the ordinary way there would certainly remain a good deal loosely\nscattered about. They might have been full or half-full at the time the\nplace was left as we found it. Possibly, instead of ten men, the\ngarrison may have been ten times as strong at first, but in the fifty\nor hundred years before the last survivors died they may have dwindled\nto a tenth of that number. However, it is plain that, as you say, the\nstore of food was not carried away, but was consumed to the last grain.\nIn the same way you can see, by the way the sacks and bags are tumbled\nabout and turned inside out, how careful was the search for any remnant\nthat might have been overlooked when they were first emptied. It all\npoints to starvation.\"\n\nThree of the largest divisions bore evident traces that at some time or\nother, animals, probably llamas or vicunas, had been closely penned\nthere. Another had been occupied by a store of hay, some of which still\nremained. When they had thoroughly examined this room, Harry looked at\nhis watch and said, \"It is late in the afternoon--our torches are\nnearly finished; however, there is time for a casual look round at the\ncellars below. To-morrow we will begin a regular search there.\"\n\nThey descended by the staircase to the basement.\n\n\"How narrow this place is!\" Bertie exclaimed. \"It is not much more than\nhalf the width of the room above.\"\n\n\"Of course it is not; the two rooms above occupied the whole width of\nthe house, these only occupy the width between the passage and the\nrock-wall on each side. You see, the tunnel is twelve feet wide, and we\nmay take it that these walls are at least three feet thick--it is not\nas if they had been built of brick, or even of stones cut to shape.\nThey knew nothing of the arch, and, as you saw outside, this came up\nnearly to a point. The stones were longer and longer with each course,\neach projecting over the one below it, until, when they were within two\nfeet of joining, a very long slab was laid across them. The stones may\nbe three feet wide at the bottom and ten feet at the top, and you see\nthe wall extends over here in the same way--as of course it must have\ndone, otherwise the whole thing would have overbalanced and fallen in\nbefore that slab at the top was added. So, you see, there is the width\nof the tunnel, twelve feet, and the two walls, say six feet more, to be\ntaken off the fifty feet. So the cellars by the side of the passage can\nonly be about sixteen feet and a half at this end, which is what they\nseem to be, and will go away to nothing at the other end, as we shall\nsee presently.\"\n\nThe first thing they saw was a sunken tank in the floor. This was full\nof water. It was about four feet square, and on sounding it with one of\nthe ramrods, they found it was about the same in depth, the water\ncoming to within a foot of the top. It was against the wall facing the\nravine.\n\n\"This must have some connection with the stream. Otherwise it would\nhave been dry long ago.\"\n\n\"We did not see any hole when we went down the passage,\" Bertie said.\n\n\"No. Most likely a hole something like this was cut in the rock\noutside, and a pipe driven to the bottom of this cistern. They would\nonly have to fill the one in the tunnel with cut blocks to within a\nfoot of the surface, and with smaller stones to the same level as the\nbed of the stream; then the water in the cistern would always be level\nwith that outside. They put it in this end so as to be well out of\nreach of the salt water farther in. They were no fools who built this\nplace. However closely they were besieged, and even if the enemy\noccupied the space in front of the house, their water-supply was\nsecure.\"\n\n\"But in time of floods, Harry, if the water rose a foot in the\npassage--and we saw it did more than that--it would flood the whole of\nthis basement.\"\n\n\"That is so, Bertie; but you may be sure that there was some provision\nagainst that. They would have some valve that they could shut, or\npossibly there was a block of wood covered with leather that they could\npush into the pipe at the bottom of this cistern.\"\n\nBeyond a considerable store of firewood, in large and small blocks,\nnothing could be seen in the chamber.\n\n\"I expect these two places were used as prisons,\" Harry said, \"though\nin case a very large force were assembled some may have slept here. At\nordinary times the upper rooms would be quite sufficient. But you see\nthey had to build the whole height of the rocky arch, and they wanted\nthe entrance to the place to be so far above the ground-level that it\nwould be extremely difficult for an enemy to climb into it. A hostile\nforce could only have come in at that entrance, and a small body of\ndetermined men might have held it against a host. These lower chambers\nwere simply cellars; the store-rooms were above them, and the habitable\npart of the castle. Now let us look at the chamber on the other side;\nno doubt we shall find it just like this.\"\n\nThis proved to be the case. There were another cistern and more piles\nof firewood, otherwise it was empty. After a short survey they returned\nto the main chamber, bringing up with them two of the empty leather\nbags. In these they placed the bones of the dead, the remains all\ncrumbling when touched, as the first skeleton had done. The bags were\nlowered to the ground, and the four searchers descended and carried\nthem to the mouth of the ravine. In a spare bag which they brought with\nthem they placed the bones of the two skeletons on the steps, and then\ncarried them all out to the open valley.\n\n\"We will bury them when we move the camp down here to-morrow morning,\"\nHarry said. \"We forgot the two up at that window. That is no matter, we\ncan throw them out to-morrow; they will lie as well at the bottom of\nthe sea as in the earth here.\"\n\nNot much was said as they returned to the castle. They had been a very\nsilent party all day. The gloom and darkness, the way in which their\nvoices echoed in the empty hall, had exercised a depressing effect on\nthem; and Donna Maria, generally the most talkative of the party, had\nnot quite recovered from the shock which the exit of the bats had given\nher. It was not until she had cooked a meal, and they all sat down to\nit, that they quite recovered their spirits. They had found Jose\nawaiting their return. He had a blazing fire, having brought down as\nmuch firewood as he could carry, and Dias had briefly told him the\nresult of their explorations.\n\n\"Well, Harry, what do you think altogether?\" Bertie asked after the\nmeal was over.\n\n\"I think we ought to be very well satisfied,\" he replied. \"Everything\nhas borne out the ideas we had. The castle may have been built as a\nfortress by some great chief, certainly before the time of the Incas,\nor it may have been used for a prison. The ornaments and things we\nfound showed that it was known to the Incas. They would have had no\noccasion to use it when they were undisputed masters of the country,\nbut when the troubles came with the Spaniards a garrison was placed\nhere, and possibly some of their chiefs took refuge in the place. Then\ncame the time when all opposition to the invaders ceased, and only a\nsmall body of men were left here to guard the secret, and the treasure\nif there were any. Generations may have passed before the last of the\ngarrison died of hunger, and probably all others who were in the secret\nfell in some insurrection or died in the mines. All this seems plain\nenough, except that possibly there was no treasure. That left by the\nChimoos may have been discovered by the Incas. I should think it\nextremely likely that the ship Dias mentioned as setting out with a\nlarge amount of treasure was intended to land its stores here.\n\n\"It may have done so, or it may have sunk at sea. I am inclined to\nthink that it was lost, because the traditions concerning these hidden\ntreasures seem to be extremely accurate; and yet, as Dias says, none\ntell of any Inca treasure being concealed here. However, it is quite\npossible that the treasure did come here and was landed, and that the\nship was then broken up, so that it might be supposed she was lost at\nsea, and that this was kept so profound a secret by the men here, that\nthe news was never generally known even among the natives. So far our\nsearch to-day has been successful, but I see that a hunt for the\ntreasure will be a very difficult one. Certainly in the upper chambers\nthere doesn't appear any possibility of such a hiding-place existing.\nThe whole space is accounted for. The walls are all of solid stone, and\nhave no special thickness. If the roofs had been arched there might be\nempty spaces on each side of the spring of the arch, but they are\nsupported by pillars or walls, with only just space between the floors\nfor the beams of solid stone. Of course it is in the lowest room that\none would expect to find hiding-places like those we saw at\nPachacamac.\" He paused.\n\n\"Well, why should they not be there, Harry?\"\n\n\"Because, as we saw, the floor is at most twelve inches above the\nwater-level. How is it possible that they could have constructed\nchambers below that level, that is in the bed of a torrent? It is\nprobable that the solid rock lies many feet below the bed of the\nstream. A portion of that great arch must from time to time have fallen\ninto it; and it may be that the river once ran forty or fifty feet\nbelow its present level. In all the places that we have seen these\ntreasure chambers were formed in solid adobe foundations, as the\ntemples always stood on artificial terraces. With all our appliances at\nthe present time it would be next to impossible to sink in a stratum of\ngreat rock fragments below the water level, and I do not believe that\nthe old people here could have done so even had it been a solid rock.\nThe difficulties of excavating chambers in it would have been enormous.\nThey could split rocks with the grain, and all the stone walls we have\nseen were made of regular pieces, and evidently formed of stone so\nsplit. They were able to give them a sort of facing with great labour,\nbut the tools they had were not made of material hard enough to work in\nsolid rock, and the labour of excavating such chambers would have been\nstupendous. Therefore I am at a loss to imagine where any such chambers\ncan be in that castle.\"\n\nDias nodded gravely. He had been with travellers who had done a great\ndeal of excavation, and he was able to understand Harry's argument.\nMaria, who was listening attentively, also understood it. Jose simply\nrolled cigarettes and smoked them. It was a matter for his elders, and\nhe did not even try to follow what Harry was saying. There was some\nminutes' silence, and then Bertie said, \"But the floors are all even.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, Bertie?\" Harry asked in a puzzled tone.\n\n\"I mean, Harry, that they run straight along. There is no dip in them.\"\n\n\"Of course there isn't. Who ever heard of building floors on the <DW72>?\"\n\n\"Yes, that is what I mean. We know that the tunnel <DW72>s down its own\nheight. It is twelve feet high at the entrance, and at the lower end it\nis some inches below the level, so it falls twelve feet at least. At\nthe end where the cistern is, the floor of the basement is only a few\ninches above the bottom of the passage; therefore at the other end it\nmust be twelve feet above the water-level.\"\n\n\"You are right, Bertie!\" Harry exclaimed. \"What a fool I was not to\nthink of it! There must be a space underneath it a hundred feet long,\nsloping from nothing down to twelve feet. There is room for a dozen\nchambers such as those we saw on each side of the tunnel. Well done,\nBertie! you have given me fresh hope. It would be a splendid\nhiding-place, for any searchers who came down and saw the water in the\ncistern would believe at once that, as neither the Chimoos nor the\nIncas could have known how to build under water, there was no use in\nsearching for hidden chambers under this floor. You see, neither of\nthem had any knowledge of cement or mortar. All their bricks and stones\nare laid without anything of the sort; and whatever amount of labour\nwas available no chamber could be made under water, for as fast as\nholes were dug the water would come in, and even if they could line it\nwith stone-work the water would penetrate through the cracks. Now,\nDias, that we see with certainty where we have to dig, we can make our\npreparations. I will write down a list of the things we decided the\nother day we should want:--Six kegs of powder, two hundred feet of\nfuse, four boring-tools, six steel wedges, the smallest smith's fire\nyou can buy--for we shall have to sharpen the tools,--six borers, a\nlarge bundle of torches, four sledge-hammers--we have enough pickaxes\nand shovels,--and another fifty fathoms, that is a hundred yards, of\nrope. I don't know anything else that we shall want in the mining way.\n\n\"You and your wife had better settle what provisions you must get. We\nshall certainly need a good supply of flour--a couple of sacks, I\nshould think--tea, coffee, and sugar, dried or salted meat. And you\nmight get a supply of smoked fish. I have no doubt that we shall catch\nfresh fish here in the sea, but we shall all be too busy to spend much\ntime on that. You had better get three or four gallons of pulque; one\ncannot be always drinking coffee. We have still got a good stock of\nwhisky and brandy. Your wife will certainly want a good supply of red\npepper and other things for her stews. It would not be a bad thing to\nhave a couple of crates of poultry. Don't pack them too closely, or\nhalf of them will be smothered before you get them here. Dead meat\nwould be of no use, for it won't keep in this heat. We can turn them\nall out in the courtyard in front of the castle, and they can pick up\ntheir living there among the lower <DW72>s of the cliffs. We can give\nthem a few handfuls of grain a day. Don't get too many cocks, and let\nthe hens be young ones. They ought to supply us with plenty of eggs and\nsome broods of chickens. You must calculate what the weight will be,\nand take the mules accordingly.\"\n\n\"Very well, senor. I need not be away more than three days at most. It\nis only about twenty miles to Ancon.\"\n\n\"You might take the two llamas down with you and sell them there. They\nhave done good work, and I should not like to kill and eat them. So\nmind you sell them to someone who wants them for carriage work. We\nshall not require them any more for that purpose. Will you want to take\nJose with you?\"\n\n\"I think not, senor, for I should say that four baggage mules will be\nample, and I can lead them myself; and certainly you will find Jose\nuseful here.\"\n\nDias and his wife then withdrew a short distance from the fire, and\nengaged in an animated conversation as to the things she required.\n\n\"Don't stint matters,\" Harry said, raising his voice. \"We may be here\nfor the next two or three months, and the less frequently you have to\ngo down to buy things the better. It would be easy to account for your\nfirst purchases by saying that you were going on an expedition to the\nmountains, but you could not go to the place with the same story again.\"\n\n\"There are other places I can go to, senor; but I will get a good store\nof everything this time.\"\n\nDias started at daybreak with four mules and the two llamas. The others\nrolled up the tent-beds and the remaining stores, loaded up the other\nmules, and moved down to the mouth of the ravine. Here they pitched the\nlittle tents again.\n\n\"They will form a central point for the mules to come to,\" Harry said.\n\"We will leave the sacks of maize here, but give the animals a good\nfeed now. They will be sure to keep close to the spot. All the other\nthings we will carry into the castle; but before we start we will bury\nthese bags of bones.\"\n\nWhen this was done, and the saddles taken off and piled together\nagainst the rocks, the other things were made up in portable packets,\nand they started up the ravine. They made three journeys before\neverything was brought to the foot of the ladder leading up to the\nwindow. Then the two brothers mounted, and hauled the things up with a\nrope which Jose, who remained below, fastened to them. When the last\nwas up he went to the foot of the rock and brought several armfuls of\nthe wood he had thrown down on the previous day. This was also hauled\nup.\n\n\"You had better fetch some more, Jose. We mean to keep a big fire\nburning here night and day; it will make the place cheerful. I will\nhave a fire also burning where we are at work below. Now, senora, we\nwill rig up some blankets on a line between the pillars at the end of\nthe room opposite to that in which we found the skeletons, so as to\nmake a special apartment for you and Dias. We will spread our beds at\nnight near the fire.\"\n\nThe screen was soon made. A cord was run from the wall to the pillar\nnext to it, some five feet above the floor, and three blankets were\nsufficient to fill the space.\n\nHarry was about to make another line from the pillar, when Maria said:\n\n\"I would rather not, senor; I am not a bit afraid. This screen is quite\nlarge enough, and it will be more cheerful not to be shut up\naltogether, as then, when I am lying down, I can see the reflection of\nthe fire on the walls, and it will be much more cheerful.\"\n\nThen a blazing fire was lit. The wood was almost as dry as tinder, and\nburnt without smoke. It was built almost touching the back wall, in\nwhich, some five feet above the fire, Harry with a pick made a hole\nfour inches deep.\n\nWhile he was doing this, Jose went down and cut a sapling four inches\nin diameter, growing in a cleft on the rock, and from this cut off two\nsix-foot lengths and brought them up. One end of the thickest of these\nwas driven into the hole and tightly wedged in there, the other end was\nlashed securely to an upright beam.\n\n\"There, Maria,\" he said when it was finished, \"you will be able to hang\nyour pots and kettles from that at any height you like above the fire.\nNow, you can set to work as soon as you like, to get breakfast for us.\nWe have been at work for four or five hours, and have good appetites.\"\n\n\"I have the cakes ready to bake, senor, and I sha'n't be long before I\nget an olla ready for you.\"\n\n\"Well, Jose, what do you think of the place?\" Harry asked.\n\n\"I should like it better if it were not so big,\" the lad said. \"I shall\nwant a broom, senor, to sweep out the dust.\"\n\n\"It is three inches deep,\" Maria said.\n\n\"I should not bother about that, Maria; it would be a tremendous job to\nsweep such a big room, and the dust is so fine that it would settle\nagain and cover everything. Besides, it will be a good deal softer to\nlay our beds on than the stones would be, so I think you had better let\nit remain as it is, especially as you are fond of going about without\nyour shoes. I think I will rig up a blanket against the doorway. It\nwill make the place look a good deal more snug, and will keep the bats\nfrom returning.\"\n\n\"I am not afraid of the bats, now I know what they are; but I should be\nconstantly expecting them to rush out again.\"\n\n\"I expect a good many went back last night,\" Harry said. \"We won't put\nthe blankets up till after dark. They are sure to come out again; then,\nas soon as they have gone, we will close it, and they won't be able to\nget in when they come back before daybreak.\"\n\nHarry's expectations were fulfilled. At dusk a stream of bats rushed\nout again, but this time quite noiselessly. The rush lasted for three\nor four minutes. As soon as they had gone, the blankets were hung up,\nand fastened across the doorway.\n\n\"They will be puzzled when they come back.\"\n\n\"Yes, senor,\" Maria said; \"but when they find that they can't get in\nhere, they will come in through the openings above.\"\n\n\"So they will; I did not think of that. But when they once find that\nthey cannot get out here in the evening, they will go out where they\ncame in, and we shall have no more trouble with them. I don't know\nwhether they are good to eat?\"\n\nMaria gave a little cry of horror.\n\n\"Oh, senor! I could not eat such horrible things!\"\n\n\"Their appearance is against them, Maria; but when people eat\nalligators, frogs, snakes, and even rats, I don't see why a bat should\nbe bad. However, we won't touch them unless we are threatened by\nstarvation.\"\n\n\"I should indeed be starving before I could touch bats' flesh, senor.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Harry said, \"if people eat monkeys, rats, and squirrels--and it\nseems to me that a bat is something of a mixture of the three--one\nmight certainly eat bats, and if we are driven to it I should not mind\ntrying; but I promise you that I won't ask you to cook them.\"\n\nThey chatted for another hour, and then Maria went off to her corner.\nThe brothers spread their beds by the fire, and Jose had his blanket\nand poncho, and it was arranged that any of them who woke should put\nfresh logs on the fire.\n\nThey were all roused just before dawn by a squeaking and twittering\nnoise. They threw on fresh logs, and as these blazed up they could see\na cloud of bats flying overhead. They kept on going to the doorway, and\nwhen they found they could not get through they retired with angry\nsqueaks. The light was gradually breaking, and in a few minutes all had\nflown out through the opening. Harry and his brother followed them, and\ncould see them flitting about the upper windows. Presently, as if by a\ncommon impulse, they poured in through the various openings.\n\n\"I don't suppose we shall see any more of them,\" Harry said, \"and I own\nthat I shall be glad. There is something very weird in their noiseless\nflitting about, and in the shadows the fire casts on the ceiling.\"\n\n\"They are a great deal larger than any bats I have seen,\" Bertie said.\n\n\"I have seen as large, or larger, at Bombay and some of the towns on\nthe coast.\"\n\n\"They bite people's toes when they are asleep, don't they?\"\n\n\"Yes, the great vampire bat does, but I have never heard of any others\ndoing so. They live on insects, and some of them are, I believe,\nvegetarian.\"\n\n\"Are vampire bats found here?\"\n\n\"I do not think so; I fancy that they inhabit Java and other islands in\nthe Malay Archipelago. However, they are certainly rare, wherever they\ncome from, and you can dismiss them altogether from your mind.\"\n\n\"I was glad when I heard your voices, senors,\" Maria said when she\nappeared a quarter of an hour later. \"I knew they would not hurt me;\nbut I was horribly frightened, and wrapped myself up in my blanket and\nlay there till I heard you talking, and I heard the logs thrown on the\nfire; then I felt that it was all right.\"\n\n\"I don't suppose they will come again, Maria.\"\n\nAfter drinking a cup of coffee, with a small piece of maize cake,\nBertie said:\n\n\"What is the programme for to-day?\"\n\n\"We can't do much till Dias comes back. We may as well go down and have\na look at the lower rooms. I don't think there is much dust on the\nfloor there, but while Jose is away looking after the mules we will cut\nenough bushes to make a couple of brooms. We shall want the place swept\nas clean as possible, so that we can look about, but I don't think\nthere is the least chance of our being able to move the stones. Before\nwe do anything we will go down to the pool and have a swim, and dive\nout through the entrance and have a look at those rocks.\"\n\n\"That is right,\" Bertie said. \"I was longing for one yesterday morning,\nbut of course the first thing to be done was to examine this place.\"\n\n\"Would it be safe for me to bathe, senor?\"\n\n\"Quite safe, Maria; the <DW72> is very gradual, and you need have no\nfear of getting out of your depth suddenly. We will be off at once,\nBertie.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nAT WORK\n\n\nHarry and his brother went to the edge of the pool, where they\nundressed and waded out. They found that the bottom of the passage\nsloped more gradually at the edge of the water than it did higher up,\nand they were able to walk out till they came to the point where the\nroof dipped into the water. They dived, and in a few strokes came up\nbeyond the roof.\n\n\"This is glorious!\" Bertie said. \"We have often bathed in pools, but\nthis is a different thing altogether. It is more than a year since we\nhad our last dip in the sea, the day we arrived at Callao.\"\n\nAlthough there was little or no wind, the rollers were breaking on the\nline of rocks outside, pouring over the lower points in volumes of\nfoam, and coming in broken waves up the passage.\n\n\"We mustn't go beyond the point, Bertie, or we may be dashed against\nthe foot of the cliff. We will climb up that rock to the left; it is\nnot too steep, and I think we can manage it. From there we shall get a\ngood view of this side of the house and of the situation in general.\"\n\nIt required considerable care to climb the rocks, and more than once\nthey hurt their feet on sharp projections. The top of the rock,\nhowever, was smooth by the action of time and sea, and they were able\nto sit down on it in comfort.\n\n\"The castle is just as you described it, Bertie; and certainly no one\nsailing past, however close he came outside these rocks, would be able\nto detect it. No doubt the stone of which it is built is the same as\nthat of the cliffs. Most likely it was taken from the ravine where the\npassage now is, and had fallen from the arch above. It might have been\nmore noticeable at first, but now it is weathered into exactly the same\ntint as the cliffs. The openings are very dodgily placed, and a\nstranger would not dream that they went many inches in. Now, from where\nwe stand we can look up into that curious opening on the top story. I\nhave been puzzling over that ever since I saw it, but can't think of\nany possible reason for its having been cut like that, except to enable\nthem to throw stones on to any boat that came into this passage behind\nthe rocks; and yet that can hardly have been the case, for, as I\nremarked, there are no stones piled up there. Certainly they had a very\nlarge number of arrows, but stones would be very much more useful than\narrows against a boat almost under their feet. However, that does not\nconcern us now. This line of rocks must greatly aid in hiding the house\nfrom the sea. They are higher than you thought they were, looking down\nat them from above. We are quite thirty feet above the water, and at\ntwo or three points they are at least ten or twelve feet higher. Of\ncourse a short way out no one would be able to see that they were\ndetached from the cliff, or that there was any passage whatever behind\nthem.\n\n\"Besides, they break the force of the waves. If it was not for them it\nwould be impossible for any boat to come up close to the face of the\nhouse, and a heavy storm might even break down the wall altogether. A\ntremendous sea would roll in here in a westerly gale; and if it hadn't\nbeen for these rocks it would have been necessary to build the lower\npart of the house absolutely solid to resist the sea. It is possible\nthat the rocks were higher than they now are when the place was first\nconstructed, in which case the house might have been almost entirely\nhidden from sight. Well, we may as well go back again, Bertie; we know\nall there is to be known about this side.\"\n\nThey swam back into the tunnel, dressed, and went out.\n\n\"We have come out, Maria,\" Bertie called. \"The coast is clear for you.\nThe water is not so deep as we thought it was, and you can walk out to\nthe point where the roof comes down on to the water without getting out\nof your depth.\"\n\nIt did not take them long to cut a number of switches to serve as\nbrooms, and a couple of handles. They carried them up into the house,\nand lashed the switches firmly on to the handles. The work was rough,\nbut the brooms when completed were large, and, although not strong\nenough for heavy work, would do well to sweep aside the thin layer of\nalmost impalpable dust on the floor below.\n\n\"Shall we take wood down there, Harry?\"\n\n\"No; I think a fire would be a drawback rather than an assistance. It\nwould be very valuable if we were working at one spot, but it could\ngive no general light in a place a hundred feet long. We will take a\ntorch down, and hold it and sweep by turns. We shall only want, to\nbegin with, to make a clear path a couple of feet wide down the middle.\nOf course later on we shall clear it all. That will be sufficient to\nenable us to see how the floor is constructed, whether with big blocks\nor small ones, how closely they are fitted together, and so on. It is\ncertainly unlikely that we shall find any indication as to where\nchambers exist.\"\n\nIt took but a very short time to clear the path; the dust was so light\nthat one sweep of the broom cleared it away. When they got to the\nfarther end they returned to examine the floor. For four or five feet\nfrom the cistern the rock had been evidently untouched, except to cut\noff any projecting points. Then there was a clear line running across\nthe path. Bertie held the torch down close to it. Harry knelt down and\nexamined it.\n\n\"This is a clean cut, Bertie. It is evidently solid above this, but the\nstone is not quite the same colour on each side of it, and it looks as\nif they had cut away the rock here and begun to build so as to keep the\nfloor level. The cut may be six inches deep and it may be a foot, that\ndoesn't matter. The face of this stone is very smooth, but it is not\ncut; it is, I think, the face of the natural fracture. Move the torch\nalong and let us see where the next join is. Ah, here it is!\"\n\nThe slab was four feet across.\n\n\"You had better sweep the dust off both ways, Bertie, so that we may\nsee what size it is.\"\n\nIt was, they found, about eight feet long.\n\n\"It has straight edges, Harry, almost as straight as if it had been\nsawn.\"\n\n\"Very likely it was sawn, Bertie; They could have had no tools that\nwould cut a hard stone like this regularly, but as they were certainly\nclever builders they must have employed some means to do it. Possibly\nthey used a saw without teeth, for however much they might have\nhardened the copper, the teeth could not have stood, but if they had a\nhard copper band fixed like the saw some masons use, and kept the stone\nmoistened with fine sand, they might have cut into it. Of course it\nwould have been a slow process; but they would not have needed to go\nfar into the stone, for when they got down two or three inches they\nmight have broken it through by dropping a heavy weight on the end. It\nwould not have mattered if the fracture had not been straight below the\ncut, for only on the surface would they have wanted to fit accurately\nto the next stone. In another way they might have got a straight edge,\nthat is, by driving very dry wedges into the cut made by the saw, and\nthen moistening them. I know that great stones can be split in that\nway. They may have used both methods. However, it doesn't matter to us\nmuch how they did it. It is clear that they could in some way or other\ncut stones. As they took the trouble to do so here, we may conclude\nthat they were anxious to have a smooth floor that would be extremely\ndifficult to get up.\n\n\"They would never have taken all this trouble if they had merely been\nmaking a floor for a cellar. For that purpose it would only have been\nnecessary to throw rocks and stones of all sizes into the vacant space\nbelow, and when it was nearly full, to level it with small stones and\nsand. That they chose to undertake such tremendous labour as the making\nof so regular a floor as this must have been, shows that they had some\nvery strong motive for doing so.\"\n\nGoing carefully along the track they had cleared, they found that the\nstones were of different sizes; some were but two feet wide, others as\nmuch as ten, but all fitted so closely together that it was difficult\nto see the joints.\n\n\"It is going to be a hard job to get these out, Bertie,\" Harry said,\nwhen they had completed their examination, \"and it is lucky for us that\nthe room gradually narrows from sixteen feet wide to two at the other\nend, and when we stepped it we made it eighty feet long. We need not\ntake up the stones near the rock wall, for the ravine would naturally\nnarrow as it went lower, and the depth would be greatest by the side of\nthe wall of the tunnel.\"\n\n\"Well, we shall soon blow up the stones when we have got the powder.\"\n\n\"I hope so, Bertie; but I see that we shall have difficulty unless\nthese top stones are extraordinarily thick.\"\n\nBertie looked surprised. \"Why, I should have thought the thicker they\nwere the more difficult to break up.\"\n\n\"Beyond a certain point that would be so. But suppose they are six\ninches thick, you may take it for granted that underneath there will be\nrubble, loose stuff, except where any chambers may be built. If we were\nto bore a hole through this top layer the powder, instead of splitting\nthe stones up, would expend its force among the loose stuff beneath it;\nand besides, instead of remaining in its place, it might get scattered,\nand we would then get no explosion at all.\"\n\n\"Then we should only have to make the hole four inches deep, Harry?\"\n\n\"As a result of which there would only be two inches of tamping over\nthe powder, and this would blow right out, as if from a little mortar,\nand would have no effect whatever upon the stone. I have no doubt that\nwe shall find some way to get over these difficulties, but it is\nevident that the work will not be all clear sailing.\"\n\n\"Of course we shall manage it somehow, Harry, even if we have to smash\nup all the stones with the sledge-hammers Dias will bring us.\"\n\n\"Is breakfast nearly ready, senora? That swim in the sea has given us a\nprodigious appetite. Did you enjoy it?\"\n\nMaria nodded.\n\n\"It is very nice, senor; but I should have liked it better if the water\nhad not been so blue. It seems so strange bathing in blue water.\"\n\n\"You will soon get accustomed to it,\" Bertie laughed. \"There are no\npools except that one two miles up the valley. Besides, it is much\nnicer to have a great bathing chamber all to yourself. Here comes Jose!\"\n\n\"Well, Jose, are the mules all right?\" he shouted.\n\n\"Yes, but I had difficulty in catching them. They had evidently been\nfrightened by something, and were three miles up the valley with their\ncoats all staring. It must have been either a puma or a jaguar. Of\ncourse they must have got wind of him in time; but as, fortunately,\nthey were not tethered, they were able to get away from him.\"\n\n\"I should think he must be up somewhere among the bushes, Jose,\" Harry\nsaid. \"We had better go down tonight and see if he returns again. We\nshall be losing some of the mules if we don't put a stop to his\nmarauding. Besides, it will be very dangerous for you, Jose, cutting the\nwood up there, if he is lurking somewhere. It is fortunate that you\nescaped yesterday.\"\n\n\"I expect he was on the other side of the ravine, senor; and even if he\nhad not been, the sound of the chopping would have scared him. They\nwill not often attack in the daytime.\"\n\nWhen they had finished their breakfast Jose asked what he should do\nnext.\n\n\"There is nothing else to do, so it would be as well to take our\npickaxes and get some of those brackets out of the walls. We will begin\nwith the other rooms of this floor and leave these here till the last.\"\n\n\"I will come and hold a torch for you, senors,\" Maria said. \"I like to\nbe doing something. I will wash up first, and then I shall have nothing\nto do till it is time to get ready for dinner. Now I know there is a\nsavage beast about I should not like to go down the ladder.\"\n\n\"There is very little chance of his coming down the rocks,\" Harry said.\n\"He is more likely to be lying somewhere on the other side watching the\nmules.\"\n\nNo move was made until the woman was ready to start. Then they lit two\ntorches. She took one and Bertie the other, while Jose and Harry took\ntwo picks. It was hard work, for the brackets were driven far into the\npillars and walls. It was necessary to knock away the stones round them\nto a depth of two or three inches before they could be got out. They\nworked one at each side of a bracket, relieving each other by turns,\nand after four hours' work only eighteen brackets had been got out. As\nfar as they could tell by lifting them, the weight was somewhat greater\nthan they had at first supposed. Harry could hold one out in each hand\nfor a minute and a half, Bertie and Jose for a little over half a\nminute, and they agreed that they must be about twenty pounds each.\n\nBy this time their shoulders ached, and it was agreed that they had\ndone a good day's work. For the rest of the day they did nothing but\nsit on the sill of the window and smoke quietly. The next day's work\nwas similar, and twenty more brackets were got out. Late in the\nafternoon they saw Dias coming down the steps, and at once went down\nthe ladder to meet him.\n\n\"Have you got everything, Dias?\"\n\n\"I think so, senor, and I can tell you that the mules have had a pretty\nheavy load to bring back.\"\n\n\"Well, we will go with you at once, Dias, and bring some of the things\nup. I expect you have had nothing to eat since the morning. Before you\ndo anything else you had better go in. Your wife has been keeping a\ndish hot for you, as she did not know when you might arrive.\"\n\n\"I shall not be long before I come and help you, senor. I have\nunsaddled the mules and turned them out to graze.\"\n\n\"It is just as well, Dias, for there is a beast somewhere about that\ngave them a fright last night. We will get all the eatables up\nto-night, the powder and drills and hammers we can very well leave till\nto-morrow morning.\"\n\nIt took them four trips to bring the provisions over, for it required\ntwo of them to carry each sack of flour, and indeed all had to give\ntheir aid in getting them up the rocky <DW72> at the foot of the wall.\n\n\"No one seemed to think it unusual, your taking so large a load, I\nhope, Dias?\" Harry said as they sat down to their evening meal.\n\n\"No, senor. The man I bought the powder of was a little surprised at\nthe amount I wanted; but I said that I might be absent many weeks in\nthe mountains, and might want to drive a level in any lode that I might\ndiscover. I led him to believe that I had seen a spot in the mountains\nthat gave good indications, and that two of my comrades were waiting\nthere for my return to begin work at it. I sold the llamas to a man who\ncarries goods from Ancon up to Canta, and got the same price that you\ngave for them.\"\n\nHarry then told him the work on which he had been engaged since he had\nbeen away.\n\n\"Of course there is no hurry about the brackets, but as we could do\nnothing else without the powder and drills, it was just as well to get\nthem out, as otherwise we might have been delayed when we had done our\nother work. We think that they weigh twenty pounds each, so that\naltogether they will be worth nearly four thousand pounds. Not a bad\nstart. I am afraid we sha'n't make such quick work down below.\"\n\n\"We shall see,\" Dias said cheerfully, for now that his fear of the\ndemons had passed he was as eager as Harry himself to begin the search\nfor the treasure.\n\n\"Has Maria seen any more bats?\"\n\n\"Yes, she has seen some more bats,\" his wife said, \"but no demons.\nDias, what do you think? Don Harry suggested that we might eat the\nbats.\"\n\n\"I have heard of their being eaten,\" Dias said, \"and a man who ate them\nraw told me that he had never enjoyed anything more. But I should not\nlike to try it myself, unless I were driven to it as he was.\"\n\n\"How was that, Dias?\"\n\n\"He was a muleteer, senor, and was up in the mountains. He had a cargo\nof silver on his mule, and during the day he had seen some men who he\ndoubted not were brigands on the top of the ravine he passed through.\nHe knew of a cavern where he had once taken refuge with the animals\nduring a storm. It lay on the hillside some twenty or thirty yards away\nfrom the road. The entrance was hidden by bushes, and he had first\nnoticed it by seeing a bear come out as he was passing along. He had\nhis pistols, and thought that it was better to risk meeting a bear than\na brigand. He arrived opposite the cave just as it became dark, and at\nonce led the mules up there. He first lighted a torch--the muleteers\nalways carry these with them--and then went in with his pistols ready,\nbut there were no signs of a bear anywhere near the entrance.\n\n\"He drove the mules in and put out his torch. The entrance had been\nonly wide enough for the laden animals to pass, but it widened out a\ngreat deal inside. He took off the loads, piled them up in the narrow\npart to make a barricade, and then sat down at the entrance and\nlistened. He soon heard five or six men come down the road talking.\nThey were walking fast, and one was saying that he could not be more\nthan half a mile ahead, and that they should soon catch him. When they\nhad gone, he went some distance in the cave and relighted his torch. He\nwent on and on. The cave was a very large one, and when he had gone, as\nhe thought, four or five hundred yards, it branched off into three. He\ntook the middle one, and followed it for a long way. At last it opened\ninto a large chamber from which there were several passages. Here he\nfound a large number of things that had evidently been stolen from\nmuleteers. There were at least a dozen mule loads of silver; goods of\nall kinds that had been brought up from the coast; the ashes of fires,\nand a great many bones and skins of llamas, and some sacks of flour.\n\n\"He thought he would now return to the mules; but apparently he entered\nthe wrong passage, for he went on till he felt sure he ought to be in\nthe chamber where he had left the animals, and he was turning to go\nback when he tripped over a stone and fell, and his torch went out.\nThen he felt in his pocket for his box of matches, and to his horror\nfound that it had gone. It must have dropped out when he was examining\nthe passages. He did not think much of it at first, but he had passed\nseveral openings on his way, and in the dark he probably turned down\none of these. At any rate he lost his way somehow, and wandered about,\nhe thinks, for hours; but it might have been much less, for he told me\nthat he quite lost his head. At last he came out into a place where he\ncould only feel the rock on one side of him, and knew that he must be\nin a large chamber.\n\n\"Looking up he saw, to his joy, a faint light, and moving a little,\ncaught sight of a star. He was utterly worn out, and threw himself\ndown. He was awakened by a strange rustling sound, and looking up saw\nthat daylight was breaking, and that a stream of bats was pouring in\nthrough a hole, which was about three feet wide. He made several\nefforts to climb up to it, but failed. The bats hung thickly from every\nprojecting point in the rocks. He hurt himself badly in one of the\nattempts to get up, and twisted his foot. All day he lay there. Then\nthe idea struck him that he would kill a bat, cut it open, and use it\nas a poultice to his foot. The creatures did not move when he touched\nthem, and he cut off the head of one of them and split it open. He did\nthis three or four times during the day, and felt that the application\nwas easing the pain of his ankle.\n\n\"When it became dusk the bats flew out again, and he knew his only\nchance was to keep his ankle perfectly rested. In the morning he killed\nsome more bats. He was by this time tortured with thirst, and sucked\nthe blood of one of them, and in the afternoon ate one raw. Another\nnight passed, and in the morning he felt so much better that he could\nmake another trial. He ate another bat to give him strength, and in the\nmiddle of the day made a fresh attempt. He had while lying there\ncarefully examined the wall of rock, at the top of which was the\nopening, and had made up his mind at what point would be best to try.\nThis time he succeeded. He made his way down the hillside, and found\nthat he was a quarter of a mile higher up the pass than the spot at\nwhich he had left the mules. He hobbled down, and to his delight found\nhis animals still in the cavern.\n\n\"He had when he first got there opened their sack of grain in order to\nensure their keeping quiet. There was still some remaining at the\nbottom. He lost no time in loading them and leading them out, and made\nhis way down the pass without seeing anything of the robbers.\nAfterwards he went back there with a good supply of torches, found his\nway to the cave, and brought down two mule-loads of silver. Gradually\nhe brought the rest of the goods down, and today he is a rich man.\"\n\n\"Well, I think under those circumstances, Dias, I would have eaten bats\nmyself. It was certainly a clever idea of his to convert them into\npoultices, though the general opinion is that cold bandages are the\nbest for a sprained ankle.\"\n\nThen they discussed their plans for the next day. \"I know nothing about\nblasting, senor. You give me instructions, and I will do my best to\ncarry them out; but it is useless for me to talk of what I know nothing\nabout.\"\n\n\"There is a lot of common sense in that, and yet in every work, Dias,\nsometimes while a skilled man is puzzling how to do a thing a looker-on\nwill suggest a satisfactory plan. That treasure has been buried there I\nhave no doubt whatever. They would never have gone to the labour of\npaving those cellars as carefully as they have done unless for some\nspecial purpose. The floor was undoubtedly made when the house was\nbuilt, and if we find treasure-chambers there they will be those of the\nold people. Of course they may have been discovered by the Incas, and\nwhen they in turn wanted to bury treasure this place might occur to\nthem as being particularly well fitted to escape search by Spaniards.\nHowever, to-morrow we shall learn something more about them. The first\nthing to do in the morning, when we have brought up the rest of the\ngoods, is to sweep the floors of those chambers carefully. When we have\ndone that we will determine where to set to work.\"\n\nTwo trips brought up the powder and instruments.\n\n\"We will take one of the kegs of powder down with us,\" said Harry, \"and\nleave the other five in the empty room behind this. It is just as well\nnot to have them in this room; the sparks fly about, and some things\nmight catch fire. I don't think there is any real danger, but, at the\nsame time, it is best to be on the safe side.\"\n\n\"There are a dozen pounds of candles in this bundle, senor. You did not\ntell me to get them, but I thought they might be useful.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Dias! they certainly will be useful. What are\nthey?--tallow?\"\n\n\"Yes, senor.\"\n\n\"Then before we go down we will get a couple of pieces of flat wood,\nand drive a peg into each, sharpened at the upper end. Candles stuck on\nthese will stand upright, and we can put them down close to where we\nare working. They will give a better light than a torch, and leave us\nall free to use the tools. Did you think of buying some more tinder?\"\n\n\"Yes, senor, I have five boxes, and half a dozen more flints.\"\n\nThey carried the keg of powder, the sledges, drills, and wedges\ndownstairs, and then Dias and Jose set to work to sweep out the two\nchambers. The work was easy, but they were obliged to stop several\ntimes, being almost choked with the light dust. Harry and Bertie\noffered to take their turn, but the others would not hear of it, and\nthey were glad to go up to what they called their drawing-room until\nthe work was done and the dust had settled a little. Then they examined\nthe pavement carefully with their torches. They had hoped that they\nmight find either copper rings, or at least holes where rings had been\nfastened, but there were no signs whatever of such things in either of\nthe chambers.\n\n\"We will begin to work half-way down,\" Harry said. \"Of course the\ntreasure may lie near the cistern end, but the depth below the floor\nwould be very shallow there. More likely the chambers would be at the\ndeep end. If we begin in the middle we may be pretty sure that we have\nnot passed them. We will begin rather nearer the passage wall than the\nother, as the depth there will be greater. It does not matter which\nstone we take, one is as likely as another. Step ten paces from the\ncistern, Bertie, and the stone you stop on we will try first.\"\n\nWhen Bertie came to a stand-still they carefully examined the pavement.\n\"You are standing on one of the cracks, Bertie; I will stay there while\nyou all bring the tools along.\"\n\n\"Shall I open the powder?\" Bertie asked.\n\n\"No. It is no good doing that until we have quite decided what we are\ngoing to do. The wedges certainly won't go into this crack. I think our\nbest plan will be to sink a bore-hole about two inches from the crack.\nWe will drive it in in a slanting direction towards the edge, and in\nthat way it will have more chance of blowing a piece out. First of all,\nwe must make a slight indentation with a pick, otherwise we sha'n't get\nthe bore to work. I will begin.\"\n\nHe took a pick and struck several blows.\n\n\"It is very hard stone,\" he said. \"I have scarcely made a mark upon it.\"\n\nHe worked for some time, and then let Bertie take the pick. The lad\nstruck a blow with all his strength, and then dropped the pick with a\nloud cry, wringing his hands as he did so.\n\n\"You have jarred your hands, Bertie; you should not hold the haft so\ntightly.\"\n\n\"It did sting!\" Bertie said. \"I feel as if I had taken hold of a\nred-hot poker. It has jarred my arm up to the shoulder; I can't go on\nat present.\"\n\n\"You try, Dias.\"\n\nDias went more carefully to work, knelt down on one knee, and proceeded\nto give a number of what seemed light blows.\n\n\"That is better than I did, Dias. The stone is crumbling into dust, and\nwe shall be able to use the borer in a short time. Perhaps it will be\nbetter after all to drive the hole down straight. It will be easier to\nbegin with; when we see how thick the stone is we shall know better how\nto proceed.\"\n\nIn ten minutes Dias had made a hole a quarter of an inch deep.\n\n\"Now, give me one of the borers--that one about two and a half feet\nlong. I will hold it, and you strike to begin with, Dias, only mind my\nfingers. Keep your eye fixed on the top of the borer, and take one or\ntwo gentle strokes to begin with; then, when you know the distance you\nhave to stand from it, do your best. You needn't really be afraid of\nstriking my fingers. I shall hold the drill at least a foot from the\ntop.\"\n\nDias began very carefully, gradually adding to the strength of the\nblows as he got the right distance, and was soon striking hard. After\neach blow Harry turned the borer a slight distance round. When he heard\nthe native's breath coming fast he told Jose to take a turn. The lad\nwas nervous; the first blow he struck only grazed the top of the borer,\nand narrowly missed Harry's fingers. Jose dropped the sledge. \"I can't\ndo it, senor; I am afraid of hitting your fingers. I will sit down and\nhold it; it does not matter if you hit me.\"\n\n\"It would matter a good deal, Jose. No, no; you have got to learn.\"\n\n\"Would it not be well, senor,\" Dias said, \"to take the borers and three\nhammers outside, and try them in soft ground? We could work them there\ntill we all got accustomed always to hit them fair. There would be no\noccasion for them to be held, and we should get confident. I could have\nhit twice as hard as I did, if I hadn't been afraid of missing it.\"\n\n\"I think that is a very good plan, Dias. The loss of a day or two will\nmake no difference. We shall make up for it afterwards.\"\n\nAccordingly the drills and hammers were all taken up, and they were\nsoon at work. Two or three gentle taps were given to the borers, to\nmake them stand upright, and then all four began work. At first they\noften either missed the heads of the borers or struck them unevenly.\n\n\"It is well, Dias, that we carried out your suggestion, as I see I\nshould have had an uncommonly good chance of getting my fingers\nsmashed, or a wrist broken. I have missed as often as any of you.\"\n\nThey stopped frequently for breath, and at the end of an hour were glad\nto lay down their hammers. Dias was comparatively fresh; his practice\nas a woodsman now did him good service.\n\n\"I should have thought from the number of trees that I have helped to\ncut down,\" Bertie said, \"that I could hit pretty hard, but this is a\ngreat deal stiffer work. I should say that this hammer is at least\ntwice the weight of the axe, and it is the lightest of the four. I ache\na good deal worse than I did when I first chopped that tree down.\"\n\n\"So do I, Bertie. We will stick at this till we get accustomed to the\nwork. By doing so we shall gain strength as well as skill.\"\n\n\"I will get some grease, senor, from Maria, and then I will rub your\nshoulders, and arms; that will do you a great deal of good.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Dias! It would be a good plan.\"\n\nDias did this to Jose as well as to the brothers, and then Jose in turn\nrubbed him.\n\nThey waited half an hour, and then Harry said: \"Let us have another\nspell.\" This time a quarter of an hour sufficed. \"It is of no use,\nHarry; I can't go on any longer,\" Bertie said. \"I feel as if my\nshoulders were broken.\"\n\n\"I am beginning to feel the same, Bertie. However, we are all hitting\nstraighter now. We will go up into the shade and take it quietly for\ntwo or three hours; then we will have a spell again.\"\n\nHowever, after the rest, they all agreed that it would be useless to\ntry again, for they could not lift their arms over their heads without\nfeeling acute pain. Three days were spent at this exercise, and at the\nend of that time they had gained confidence, and the heads of the\ndrills were no longer missed.\n\nAfter the first day they only worked for a quarter of an hour at a\ntime, taking an hour's rest. The pain in their arms had begun to abate.\nOn the following day they practised striking alternately, three\nstanding round one borer. They found this at first awkward, but by the\nend of the day they were able to strike in regular order, the blows\nfalling faster after each other on to the drill.\n\n\"I think we shall do now,\" said Bertie. \"No doubt we shall hit harder\nwith a fortnight's practice, and shall be able to keep it up longer.\nHowever, I think that even now we have sufficient confidence in\nstriking to be able to hold the borer without any fear of an accident.\"\n\nThe next day they began work early in the cellar. Jose volunteered to\ntake the first turn to hold the drill.\n\n\"You understand, Jose, you must turn it round a little after each\nstroke, and in that way it will cut the hole regularly.\"\n\nHarry took his place on one side of Jose, who sat with a leg on each\nside of the drill. Dias stood facing Harry, Bertie behind Jose holding\nthe torch so that its light fell strongly on the head of the drill. At\nfirst the two men struck gently, but gradually, as they grew confident,\nincreased the weight of their strokes until they were hitting with\ntheir full power. After ten minutes they stopped. \"Let us look at the\nhole,\" Harry said. \"How far has it got down?\"\n\nJose moved his position and Harry examined the hole. \"About an eighth\nof an inch,\" he said. \"Let us scrape the dust out of it.\"\n\n\"Shall we take a spell now, Harry?\" Bertie said.\n\n\"No, we will wait five minutes and then go on again, and after that we\nwill change places with you, relieving each other every twenty minutes.\"\n\nThe work went on, and at the end of two hours the hole was three inches\ndeep. Another hour and a half and the drill suddenly went down.\n\n\"We are through it,\" Bertie said, \"and I am not sorry.\"\n\n\"Now I will lift the drill up gently, Bertie; do you kneel down, and\nwhen I stop, take hold of it close to the floor, so that we may see the\nthickness of the stone.\"\n\n\"Five inches,\" he said as he measured it. \"Now put on a little grease,\nDias. I will lower it again, and we shall be perhaps able then to get\nsome idea of what is underneath.\"\n\nHe lowered the drill and turned it round two or three times, and then\ncarefully raised it. Some sand and little stones were sticking to it.\n\n\"Sand and gravel,\" he said. \"That settles that point. Now we have done\na good morning's work, and let us go up and have breakfast.\"\n\nMaria looked enquiringly at them. \"I was just coming down for you.\nWell, what have you done?\"\n\n\"We have drilled one hole, Maria, and none of us have got our fingers\nsmashed, so I think we have every reason to be satisfied with our first\nexperience at the work.\"\n\nAs they breakfasted they talked matters over. Harry said that he was\ncertain that the thickness of the stone was not sufficient for them to\nbreak it up by blasting. \"We shall have to try some other plan. It is\nequally certain that we cannot smash the stone with the sledge-hammers,\nand I don't think that the wedges would break it. Of course if we got\none stone out it would be comparatively easy to lift the next, as we\ncould put the crowbars under it. If we can do it in no other way, we\nmust drill a line of holes close to each other right across the stone,\nand we might then break off the piece between them and the crack and\nget our crowbars under the slab. It might be worth while to drill holes\na foot apart, from the point where we have begun to the other end of\nthe room. Of course if we found that gravel and stones were everywhere\nunder the slabs we should learn nothing; but the opening to the\nchambers is probably covered by another stone, and if we found that, we\ncould put in one or two more holes so as to be sure that it was flat,\nin which case we might smash it somehow. Of course, if we don't come\nupon a flat stone we shall conclude that they put a layer of sand and\nfine gravel over the slabs covering the vaults, and must then, as I\nsay, get up one stone and gradually lift all the rest, clearing out the\ngravel as we go to the depth of a foot or so. In that way we shall make\nsure that we shall not miss any chamber there may be.\n\n\"I think that would certainly be the best plan. At present we are\ngroping altogether in the dark, and it will take us a fortnight at\nleast to make that row of holes close to each other, as you propose.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nDISAPPOINTMENT\n\n\nSix more days were spent in driving holes according to Harry's plan.\nThe result was in all cases the same. Sand and small stones were\nbrought up attached to the grease. They had now sunk the holes at a\nmuch more rapid rate than at first, for they were accustomed to the\nwork, their muscles had hardened, and they were able to strike more\nfrequently and with greater force. They would have got on still more\nquickly had it not been for the trouble in sharpening the drills. These\nwere heated in the small blacksmith's fire Dias had brought. They were\nfirst placed in the fire, but this was not sufficiently hot to raise\nthem beyond a dull red glow. When this was done a shovelful of glowing\nfragments was taken from the fire and placed on the hearth, and among\nthese the small bellows raised the ends of the drills to a white heat,\nwhen of course they were easily worked. At first they had some\ndifficulty in tempering them. Sometimes, when cooled, the points were\ntoo soft, at other times too brittle; but at the end of a week they had\narrived at the proper medium. But one of the party had to work steadily\nto keep the drills in good order.\n\nBertie was daily employed at this work, as Jose generally failed to\ngive the proper temper to the tools. Bertie, however, generally managed\nto get in two or three hours' work below. Although perfectly ready to\ndo his share, he was by no means sorry to be otherwise employed for a\npart of the day, and as he was now able to talk Spanish with perfect\nfluency he and Donna Maria maintained a lively conversation whenever\nthey were together. All the party, however, were glad when Sunday came\nround and gave them a day of complete rest; then they would bathe,\nfish, shoot pigeons, or lie in the shade, each according to his fancy,\nand recommence work with fresh vigour the next morning.\n\nJust a fortnight after they had begun work they were about to begin a\nhole in a fresh stone. Talking it over, they had come to the conclusion\nthat this was the most likely spot in the cellar for the situation of\nan underground chamber. Farther on there would scarce be width for one,\nfor it was here but eight feet across. Where they had already tried\nthere would scarcely have been depth enough. This seemed to them to be\nthe happy medium.\n\nBefore setting to work Dias passed his torch over the stone. Presently\nhe stopped. \"Will you light two of the candles, senor; the torch\nflickers too much to see very plainly.\"\n\nSomewhat surprised, for no such close examination had been made before,\nthe candles were lighted and handed to him. Dias knelt down, and, with\nhis face close to the stone, moved about carefully, examining it for\nsome minutes without speaking.\n\n\"This stone, senor, is broken,\" he said at last, \"broken into a dozen\npieces, and they have been so carefully fitted together again that the\ndust that settled upon it quite prevented our seeing it till we swept\nit again just now, and it was only because there was a tiny chip out\nwhere I first looked that I noticed it.\"\n\nHarry knelt down and also examined the stone. Like all the others, it\nhad not been faced with tools. Consequently, although roughly even,\nthere were slight irregularities in the surface. Now, as Dias pointed\nthem out to him, he saw that there were lines running through it here\nand there.\n\n\"Look here, senor. The stone has been struck here. Here are some dents.\"\n\nThese were scarcely noticeable. The surface had taken the same colour\nas the rest of the stone. They were of irregular size, and from a\nquarter of an inch to an inch in diameter, and nearly in the centre of\nthe stone, from which point several of the cracks started.\n\n\"It certainly looks as if the stone had been struck with something\nheavy,\" Harry said. \"I should think, by the appearance, some very heavy\npiece of rock must have been dropped upon it.\"\n\n\"Yes, senor, very heavy rock--so heavy that there must have been many\nmen to lift it.\"\n\n\"It must have been heavy indeed to break up this slab.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it is not so thick as the others,\" Dias suggested.\n\n\"I don't like it, Dias. Well, let us set to work. We will try the\nwedges there. They were no use against the solid stone, but they might\nmove these pieces. Put one of the borers just at the place from which\nthese cracks start--at least, I suppose they are cracks--and let us\ndrive it in for an inch. You hold it, Jose. Don't turn it, we want it\nto go in just in a line with this crack. I know we cannot drive it in\nfar, but at least we may make it go deep enough to give a wedge a hold\nin it.\"\n\nFive such small holes were made in a crack that seemed to form a rough\ncircle, then the wedges were put in, and they began to work with\nsledges. In ten minutes Harry, examining the place carefully, said:\n\"The bit of stone is breaking up. There are lines running across it\nfrom the wedges. Give me the heaviest sledge.\" He swung it round his\nhead and brought it down half a dozen times in the centre of the\nwedges. The cracks opened so far that he could see them without\nstooping.\n\n\"Now we will try with the crowbars,\" he said.\n\nIn ten minutes a fragment of the stone was got up; then they hammered\non the wedges again, and a piece of rock, which was roughly seven or\neight inches in diameter, broke completely off.\n\n\"It is only about two and a half inches thick,\" Harry said as he drew\none of the fragments out. And, holding the candle to the hole, he went\non: \"And there is another slab underneath. That settles it. We are at\nthe top of one of these vaults. The question is, is it empty? I am\nafraid it is. This stone has evidently been broken up and fitted in\nagain with wonderful care.\"\n\n\"Why should it be fitted in carefully if they emptied the chamber?\"\n\n\"That I can't tell you, Dias, and it is of no use trying to guess now.\nFirst of all, we will get the rest of the stone up. It won't be\ndifficult, for now that we have made a start we can use our crowbars.\nJose, run up and tell my brother to come down. We shall want him to\nhelp with the crowbar; and besides, he would, of course, wish to be\nhere, now that we are on the point of making a discovery one way or the\nother.\"\n\nIn a minute Bertie came down with Jose, and Donna Maria followed. \"Jose\ntells me you have broken a hole in one of the stones,\" Bertie exclaimed\nas he ran up.\n\n\"We have got a bit out of a broken stone, Bertie. This stone had been\nbroken before, and evidently not by accident. It is only half the\nthickness of the others, and, as you can see, there is another slab\nunderneath.\"\n\n\"Who can have broken it, Harry?\"\n\n\"That question we cannot decide, but I should say probably the Incas.\nWe agreed that it was very possible they discovered the hidden\ntreasures of the Chimoos. They must have learned, as the Spaniards did,\nhow cleverly these places were hidden, and it must have been as evident\nto them as it is to us, that if there was a hiding-place here, this\nmust be the spot.\"\n\nWhen one or two more pieces of the stone had been got out by the aid of\ncrowbars, the rest was removed without the least difficulty. Another\nslab two feet square was exposed. In the middle of this was a copper\nring, and the slab fitted, into a stone casing about eighteen inches\nwide. As soon as this casing was cleared, Dias and Jose took their\nplaces on one side, the two brothers on the other. A crowbar was thrust\nthrough the ring, and all of them, taking hold of the ends, lifted with\nall their strength. At first the stone did not move, but at the second\neffort it lifted suddenly. It was the same thickness as the one they\nhad broken, and, on being moved, was easily handled. The torches were\nthrust down, and all peered eagerly into the vault. So far as they\ncould see it was empty.\n\n\"Shall I jump down, senor?'\n\n\"No, the air may be bad, Jose. Run up and bring down a short length of\nrope, twenty feet will be ample. Now, let your torch drop down, Dias.\nIf it burns, it will be safe for us to go down; if not, we must keep on\ndropping blazing brands into it till they burn.\"\n\nAs, however, the torch burnt brightly, Harry lay down, and, saying,\n\"Hold my legs, Bertie!\" looked down into the vault. Eighteen inches\nbelow the surface, the hole widened out suddenly. A minute later\nHarry's head appeared above the surface again.\n\n\"It is empty,\" he said in as cheerful a voice as he could manage. \"Of\ncourse it is a disappointment,\" he went on, \"but I felt certain that it\nwould be so directly we found the stone was cracked. The only hope was\nthat the first finders of the treasure afterwards used the place for\nthe same purpose. That they thought it possible they might do so is\nclear by the care with which they fitted the stones together.\"\n\nNone of the others spoke. The disappointment was a heavy one. Bertie\nbroke the silence by saying; \"Well, better luck next time. They may\nhave found out this place, but there may be others which they did not\nfind.\"\n\n\"Quite so, Bertie. Now we have got up one stone, It will be\ncomparatively easy work getting up the others. We will take up every\nstone to the end, and then work back till we get to a place where there\nis not more than a couple of feet between the bottom of the stone and\nthe top of the rock.\"\n\nAt this moment Jose ran into the room with the rope. Harry took it, and\ndropped one end until it nearly touched the floor below. \"Hold on,\" he\nsaid, \"and I will slip down first.\" Half a minute later he stood at the\nbottom of the chamber, beside the torch, which was still burning.\n\n\"It is only about three feet across at the bottom,\" he said; \"the wall\nby the passage goes straight up, on the other side it is the bare rock,\nso it is almost wedge-shaped. It is twenty feet long, and five feet\nhigh up to its roof, that makes it nearly seven to the upper part of\nthe mouth.\" The vault was absolutely empty. He moved about for a minute\nand then said: \"Gold has been stored here. There are particles of gold\nat the bottom, and there is gold-dust in the cracks of the broken face\nof the rock. Now I will come up again. Hold the rope tight; I will\nclimb about a yard, and then I can get my fingers on the ledge.\"\n\nHe was soon up. \"Now, do any of you want to go down?\" Dias and Jose\nshook their heads; and Bertie grumbled, \"I don't want to look at the\nbeastly hole; it has been trouble enough to get at it.\"\n\n\"Well, I think we will not do any more to-day, Dias. It has rather\ntaken the heart out of one. Still, we could not expect to hit upon the\ntreasure for the first time. We will go up and talk it over, and when\nwe have smoked a pipe or two we shall be more inclined to take a\ncheerful view of the matter. We won't talk about it till we have got to\nthe end of our second pipe.\"\n\nThe tobacco did its usual work, and it was with quite a cheerful voice\nthat Bertie broke the silence: \"The Incas must have been pretty sharp\nfellows to find that hole, Harry?\"\n\n\"Well, very likely they heard that the Chimoos had treasure there.\nIndeed they must have known, because, you see, not one of the other\nstones is broken, so they evidently knew where that chamber was\nsituated.\"\n\n\"Yes, I suppose that was it. Well, we are in fine working order now,\nand we sha'n't be very long getting the other stones up.\"\n\n\"Not very long this side anyhow, Bertie. We shall want some short\nblocks of wood to put under the stones as we raise them. I expect they\nare all five inches thick, and they must be a very big weight.\nEvidently it is going to be a longish job. As we have been a fortnight\nwithout fresh meat, Dias had better go off and buy half a dozen sheep.\nWe won't have dead meat this time. He can bring them slung over the\nmules, and we can kill them as we want them.\"\n\n\"We have not had fresh meat, but we have not done badly, Harry; we have\ngenerally had a good many eggs and some pigeons, and Jose has brought\nus in fish from that pool. But they have dwindled down lately. He only\nbrought in a couple of fish yesterday evening.\"\n\n\"Well, the pigeons are getting scarcer too, Bertie. We have killed a\ngood many, but the rest are getting very shy, and I think most of them\nmust have gone off and settled in new places on the face of the rocks\nabove the ravine. While Dias is away, we will try and lay in a stock of\nsea-fish. We can swim out and sit on the rocks during the day, and lay\nour lines at night. We have worked very hard for a fortnight, and we\ndeserve a holiday.\"\n\nDias, when he was spoken to, said he would start at once with four\nmules for Huacha. \"It is not above fifteen miles,\" he said, \"and I can\nget there this evening. I should think that I could buy the sheep\nthere; if not, I must go on to Huaura. Each mule will bring two sheep.\nOf course I could drive them, but that would seem more singular.\"\n\n\"You had certainly better take the mules, Dias. Tie the sheep carefully\non them, so that they will not be hurt.\"\n\n\"I will take eight of the leather bags, senor. The sheep are not large,\nand I will sling one on each side of the mules.\"\n\n\"Yes, it would be as well, while you are about it, to bring eight. You\nmay as well get some more coffee. We drink a lot of that, and like it\nstrong. If your wife thinks we shall want more sugar, or anything else,\nby all means get some.\"\n\nAs soon as Dias started, the lines were got ready. They cut a couple of\nsaplings to serve as rods, and Jose, digging among the rocks, found\nplenty of worms, beetles, and grubs for bait. In addition, they took a\ncake or two of maize, to break up and throw in to attract the fish.\n\n\"We had better swim out in our flannel shirts and trousers,\" Harry\nsaid. \"They will soon dry, and they will keep off the sun. If we were\nto sit there without them, we should get blistered from head to foot.\"\n\n\"Shall we fish outside the rocks, or inside, Harry?\"\n\n\"We will try both; but I think we are likelier to catch most inside. I\nshould think a back-water like that would attract them.\"\n\nThey met with equal success on both sides of the rocks, and by evening\nhad caught over forty fish, at least half of which weighed over four\npounds. Then they set the long lines, each carrying forty hooks, and\nreturned to the castle with as many fish as they could possibly carry.\nMaria was delighted with the addition to her larder, and she and Jose\nset to work at once to clean and split them. In the morning they were\nhung in strings from the broad window. Maria said they would get the\nbenefit of the heat from the walls, and any air there might be would be\nable to pass round them.\n\nBy means of the night-lines they caught almost as many fish as they had\ndone with their rods, and that day they had the satisfaction of\nbringing in more than they could carry in one journey.\n\n\"We have got plenty now to keep us going for another three weeks,\"\nHarry said, \"and we can always replenish our stock when we choose.\"\n\nDias returned at sunset carrying one sheep over his shoulders.\n\n\"I have left the others out there, senor; I don't think there is any\nfear of their straying. There is no fresh grass anywhere except near\nthe stream, and moreover, being strange to the valley, they will\nnaturally keep near the mules.\"\n\nAnother month passed in continuous labour. The stones had all been\ntaken up in the basement they had first visited, but no other chamber\nhad been found. The parallel chamber had given them much trouble at\nstarting, as no stone had been found showing any cracks upon it, and\nthey had had to blast one stone to pieces before they could begin to\ncut up the others. No chamber whatever had been discovered until they\nwere within six feet of the farther end. Then one was found, but it\nshowed no signs whatever of having ever been used.  \"So far so bad,\"\nHarry said when the supper had been eaten almost in silence; \"but that\nis no reason why we should be disheartened. If the Incas buried a\ntreasure they may have thought it prudent to choose some other spot\nthan that used by the old people.\"\n\n\"But where could it be, Harry? You agreed that there was not sufficient\ndepth between the floors for any place of concealment.\"\n\n\"That is so, Bertie, of course. I have been thinking of it a lot during\nthe past few days, when the chances of our finding a treasure under the\nbasement were nearly extinguished. There are still the side walls.\"\n\n\"The side walls!\" Bertie repeated. \"Surely they are built against the\nrock?\"\n\n\"Yes, but we don't know how straight the wall of rock is. You see, they\ndid not build against it at all in the basement, but above that the\nside walls begin. The rock must have been irregular, and as the walls\nwere built the space behind may have been filled in or may not. When\nthey came to build they may have found that there was a cavern or\ncaverns in the rock--nothing is more likely--and they may have left\nsome sort of entrance to these caverns, either as a place of refuge to\nthe garrison if the place were taken, or as a hiding-place. They might\nhave thought it more secure for this purpose than the underground\nchamber, which was their general hiding-place. At any rate it is\npossible, and to-morrow I vote that we have a thorough inspection of\nthe walls of the storeroom below this. That would be the most likely\nplace, for near the sea-level the chances of finding caverns would be\nmuch greater than higher up.\"\n\nBertie's face brightened as Harry proceeded.\n\n\"It certainly seems possible, Harry. Of course the other place seemed\nso much more likely to us that we have never given the side walls a\nthought. We may find something there after all. I do hope we may, old\nboy. I cannot believe that after things have gone altogether so well\nwith us, and we have been twice so near finding treasure, that we\nshould fail after all. Which side shall we begin on?\"\n\n\"We will have a look at them before we decide, Bertie. We have not\nreally examined them since the first day; I really forget what stores\nwe found in the two side-rooms.\"\n\nAn examination in the morning showed that the passage near the entrance\nto the rock on the left-hand side had been used for fuel, that on the\nother side was filled at the upper end with skins for some distance,\nand spears and sheaves of arrows were piled against the outer wall\nalong the rest of the distance.\n\n\"Which do you think is the most likely hiding-place?\"\n\n\"I should say the right-hand passage. The other with the fire-wood in\nit might be visited every day, but the spears and arrows would only be\nwanted in case of any attacks upon the castle, or to arm a large force\ngoing out to give battle there. They would naturally put anything they\nwanted to hide in the passage less likely to be visited.\"\n\n\"That does seem probable,\" Bertie agreed; \"therefore, hurrah for the\nright-hand side!\"\n\n\"I still think, senor,\" Dias said, \"that there must be treasure\nconcealed somewhere. I should not think a guard would have been placed\nhere, and remained here so many years still keeping watch, as we find\nthey did at that big loophole on the top floor, unless there was\nsomething to watch.\"\n\n\"Quite so, Dias. I have thought that over in every way, and I can see\nno possible motive for their being here except to prevent the place\nfrom being examined. That was needless if there was nothing to guard,\nand nothing to take away, except these silver brackets, which in those\ndays would scarcely have been worth the trouble of getting out and\ncarrying away. There must be treasure somewhere. We know now that it is\nnot in the basement, and we will try these side walls, even if we have\nto blow half of them in; there is no doubt that the stones are at least\nas thick as those at the end, but they will not be difficult to manage.\nI noticed in the upper story that they had not taken the trouble to fit\nthem nearly so accurately as they did those of the outer walls. I don't\nsay that they didn't fit well, but the stones were of irregular sizes,\nand I have no doubt that in many places we could prize them out with a\ncrowbar. Once an opening is made, there will be no difficulty in\ngetting a lot of them out, as the old people did not use cement or\nmortar. Well, to-morrow morning we will move all the spears and arrows\nacross to the other side of that passage and have a good look at the\nstones, but we will go up first and look at the side walls of all the\nother rooms and see if they are of the same build. There may be some\ndifference which we have not noticed. You see all the side walls of\nthis room are built like those in front. I didn't notice whether it was\nthe same in the other rooms.\"\n\n\"I will look at once,\" Dias said, lighting a torch at the fire.\n\n\"No, senor,\" he said, when in ten minutes he returned; \"none of the\nwalls on this floor are built of stone like this. This was the grand\nchamber, the stones are all nearly one size, and so well fitted that\nyou can hardly see where they join each other. In the other rooms they\nare not so, but the stones are, as you noticed above, irregular in\nsize, and although they fit closely, there is no attempt to conceal the\ncracks.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Dias! Well, we won't look any more to-night; we shall see\nin the morning if the room below us is built in the same way. I have no\ndoubt it is. At any rate we have done enough for to-day. There is some\nwhisky left in that bottle, Bertie, and we may as well make ourselves a\nglass of grog. Maria, you had better get down that jar of pulque. We\nwill drink to better luck next time.\"\n\nThe woman smiled faintly. She did not often do so now, her spirits had\ngradually gone down as the hopes of success faded.\n\n\"Now, Maria,\" Harry said, \"you had better take a glass of pulque for\nyourself. I know you don't often touch it, but you have been working so\nof late that I think you want it more than any of us.\"\n\n\"I cannot help feeling low-spirited, senor,\" she said. \"I have so hoped\nthat you would find the treasure you wanted, and marry this lady you\nlove, and it would be such joy for us to have in some small way repaid\nthe service you rendered us, that I felt quite broken down. I know I\nought not to have been, when you and your brother bear the\ndisappointment so bravely.\"\n\n\"'It is of no use crying over spilt milk', which is an English saying,\nMaria. Besides, it is possible that the milk may not be spilt yet, and\nuntil lately your good spirits have helped us greatly to keep ours up.\nIf I were once convinced that we had failed, I have no doubt I should\nfeel hard hit; but I am a long way from giving up hope yet. There is\ntreasure here, and if I have to blow up the whole of the old place I\nwill find it. I have got six months yet, and in six months one can do\nwonders. Anyhow, these brackets will pay us very well for our work. I\ncertainly should not have earned half the sum in any other way in the\nsame time. And even if I fail in my great object, I shall have the\nsatisfaction of knowing that I have done all in my power to gain it.\nShe will know that I have done my best. I have always told her, when I\nhave written, how much I owe to you and Dias, how faithfully you have\nserved me, and how you have always been so bright and pleasant. I have\nno doubt it has cheered her up as well as me.\"\n\nMaria was wiping her eyes now. \"You are too good, senor; it is so\nlittle I can do, or Dias either, to show our gratitude.\"\n\n\"Nonsense! You show it in every way, even in the matter-of-fact way of\nalways giving us excellent food, which is by no means unimportant. Now\nwe will all turn in, and make a fresh start to-morrow morning.\"\n\nThey were up at daybreak, and after taking their usual cup of coffee\nlit the torches and descended the stairs to the floor below.\n\nAs soon as they reached the right-hand wall, Harry exclaimed: \"Why,\nthis is built in the same way as the one we have left! The stones are\nsquared and fitted together as closely as those in the drawing-room.\nThen why should that be, except in that one room? The side walls all\nthe way up are roughly built. Why should they have taken the trouble on\nthis floor to build these, which are only meant as store-rooms, when\neven in the rooms above, which were meant for the habitation of the\nchief and his family, the rough work was deemed sufficiently good?\nThere must have been some motive for this, Dias.\"\n\n\"There must have been, senor; it is certainly strange.\"\n\n\"First of all, let us clear the wall and take a general view of it.\nGuessing won't help us; but I have the strongest hopes that behind one\nof these stones lies a cavern. By the way, Dias, take a torch and go\ninto the next chamber and see if the stones are solid there.\"\n\n\"They are just the same as those here,\" Dias said when he returned.\n\n\"I would rather that it had been the other way,\" Harry said, \"for then\nI should have been more sure that there was some special reason for\ntheir building them in this way here.\"\n\nIt took them all half an hour's work to move the spears and arrows to\nthe other side.\n\n\"Do you think, Harry, if we were to tap the stones we should be able to\nfind whether there is a hollow behind any of them?\"\n\nHarry shook his head.\n\n\"Not in the least. I have no doubt these stones are two or three feet\nthick, and there could be no difference in the sound they would make if\nstruck, whether they were filled in solid behind or had no backing. To\nbegin with, we will make a careful examination of the walls. Possibly\nwe shall see some signs of a stone having been moved. It would be very\nmuch more difficult to take one of the great blocks out and put it in\nagain than it would be to get up one of the paving-stones.\"\n\nWhen they had gone about half-way along, examining each stone with the\ngreatest care, Bertie, who was ahead of the rest, and passing the\ncandle he held along the edge of every joint, said, \"Look here! this\nstone projects nearly half an inch beyond the rest.\"\n\nThe others gathered round him. The stone was of unusual size, being\nfully two and a half feet wide and four feet long, the bottom joint\nbeing two feet above the floor.\n\nBertie moved along to let the others look at the edge. He was keeping\nhis finger on the joint, and they had scarcely come up when he said,\n\"The other end of the stone's sunk in about as much as this end\nprojects.\"\n\n\"Something certainly occurred to shift this stone a little,\" Harry\nsaid, examining it carefully. \"It is curious. If others had been\ndisplaced, one would have put it down to the shock of an earthquake--a\ncommon enough occurrence here--but both above and below it the stones\nare level with the others, and nowhere about the house have we seen\nsuch another displacement. Look! there is a heap of rubbish along the\nfoot of the wall here. Stir it up, Dias, and let us see what it is.\"\n\n\"It is sand and small stones, and some chips that look like chips of\nrock.\"\n\n\"Yes, these bits look, as you say, as if they had been chipped off a\nrock, not like water-worn stones. Though how they got here, where\neverywhere else things are perfectly tidy, I cannot say. However, we\ncan think that over afterwards. Now for the stone! Let us all put our\nweight against this projecting end. I don't in the least expect that we\ncan move it, but at any rate we can try.\"\n\nThey all pushed together.\n\n\"I think it moved a little,\" Harry said, and looked at the edge.\n\n\"Yes, it is not above half as far out now as it was.\"\n\n\"That is curious, for if it is as thick as we took it to be, it would\nweigh at least a couple of tons. We won't try to push it in any\nfarther. I am sorry we pushed it at all. Now, give me that heavy\nsledge, Jose, possibly there may be a hollow sound to it. I will hit at\nthe other end, for I don't want this to go in any farther.\"\n\nHe went to the stone beyond it first and struck two or three blows with\nall his strength. Then he did the same with the stone that they were\nexamining.\n\n\"I don't think it gives such a dead sound,\" he said.\n\nThe others were all of the same opinion.\n\n\"Good! This is another piece of luck,\" he said. \"We have certainly hit\non something out of the way.\"\n\n\"Your hammering has brought this end out again, Harry,\" Bertie said.\n\n\"So it has, and it has pushed this end in a little. Let us try again.\"\nBut although all took turns with the sledges, they could make no\nfurther impression on the stone.\n\n\"Well, we will try the drills,\" Harry said. \"In the first place, we\nwill find out how thick it is.\"\n\nThey at once set to work with the drill. Progress was slower than it\nhad been before, because, instead of striking down on the head of the\ndrill, they had now to swing the hammer sideways and lost the advantage\nof its weight; and they were obliged to work very carefully, as a miss\nwould have seriously damaged the one holding the drill. It took them\nfour hours' steady work to get the hole in three inches. Ten minutes\nlater, to their astonishment, the drill suddenly disappeared. Dias, who\nwas striking, nearly fell, for instead of the resistance he had\nexpected, the drill shot forward; the hammer hit Jose, who had this\ntime been holding the drill, a heavy blow on the arm, causing him to\nutter a shout of pain.\n\nHarry, who was sitting down having breakfast, having just handed his\nhammer to Bertie, jumped to his feet.\n\n\"How did you manage that, Dias? I suppose it slipped off the head. You\nmust have hit Jose a very heavy blow.\"\n\n\"I have hit him a heavy blow, senor, and nearly tumbled down myself;\nbut I struck the drill fairly enough, and it has gone.\"\n\n\"Gone where, Dias?\"\n\n\"I think it must have gone right through the hole, senor.\"\n\n\"Then there is an empty space behind!\" Harry shouted joyfully.\n\"However,\" he went on in changed tones, \"we must see to Jose first.\nThat blow may have fractured his arm. Let me look, Jose. No, I don't\nthink anything is broken, but there is a nasty cut on the wrist. It is\nfortunate that you were not striking straight down, Dias, for I am sure\nwe have not put anything approaching the strength into our blows, now\nwe are hitting sideways, that we exerted before. You had better go up\nto Maria, Jose, and get her to bathe your wrist with cold water, and\nput on a bandage.\"\n\n\"Now, senor, what shall we do next?\"\n\n\"Well, now that we know that its weight cannot be anything very great,\nand that certainly to some extent it can be moved, we will try\nhammering again at that end. Do you stand three or four feet beyond it,\nso as to be able to bring your sledge down with all your strength just\non the lower corner. I will face you and strike six or eight inches\nabove where you hit. Of course we must both bring our hammers down at\nthe same instant. We shall be able to do that after two or three\ntrials. Stand at the other end of the stone, Bertie, and tell us if it\nmoves at all.\"\n\nAfter one or two attempts the two men got to swing their hammers so as\nto strike precisely at the same moment, and when half a dozen blows had\nfallen, Bertie said: \"It comes out a little at each blow. It is not\nmuch, but it comes.\"\n\nThree or four minutes later he reported, \"It is an inch and a half out\nnow, and there is room to get the end of a crowbar in here.\"\n\n\"That is curious,\" Harry said as he lowered his sledgehammer, and,\ntaking up the candle, examined the end where he had been striking.\n\n\"This is sunk about the same distance, Bertie. The stone must work\nsomehow on a pivot.\"\n\nThey now put a crowbar into the end Bertie had been watching, and all\nthree threw their weight on the lever. Slowly the stone yielded to the\npressure, and moved farther and farther out. It was pushed open until\nthe crowbar could act no longer as a lever, but they could now get a\nhold of the inside edge. It was only very slowly and with repeated\nefforts that they could turn the stone round, and at last it stood\nfairly at right angles to the wall, dividing the opening into equal\nparts about two feet four each.\n\n\"There is a pivot under it; that is quite evident. It may be a copper\nball in the stone below, or it may be that a knob of the upper stone\nprojects into a hole in the lower. However, it does not matter how it\nworks. Here is an opening into something. Dias, will you go upstairs\nand tell your wife and Jose to come down? They had better bring half a\ndozen more torches. Our stock here is getting low, and we shall want as\nmuch light as possible. It is only fair that we should all share in the\ndiscovery.\"\n\nDias went off.\n\n\"Now, Bertie, we must not let our hopes grow too high. I think it is\nmore likely than not that we shall find nothing here.\"\n\n\"Why do you think so, Harry? I made sure we had as good as got the\ntreasure.\"\n\n\"I think, if there had been treasure,\" Harry went on, \"that this stone\nwould have been closed with the greatest care. They would hardly have\nleft it so carelessly closed that anyone who examined the wall would\nhave noticed it, just as we did. We found the other places most\ncarefully closed, though there was nothing in them.\"\n\n\"Perhaps there was something that prevented them from shutting--a\nlittle stone or something.\"\n\n\"But we know that that wasn't so, Bertie, because the stone yielded to\nour weight; and if it did so now, it could have been shut with the\ngreatest ease originally, when no doubt the pivot was kept oiled, and\nthe whole worked perfectly smoothly. It is almost certain that they\nwere able in some way to fasten it securely when it was shut. What is\nthat piece of square stone lying there?\"\n\n\"It fell down from above just as the slab opened.\"\n\nHarry took it up. It was about six inches long by two inches square.\n\n\"It is a very hard stone,\" he said--\"granite, I should say. I expect\nyou will find that it fits into a hole in the stone above.\"\n\n\"Yes, there is a hole here,\" Bertie said, feeling it; \"the stone goes\nright in.\"\n\n\"Well, I think, Bertie, you will find a hole in that end of the stone\nwe moved that it will fit.\"\n\nBertie crept in, and felt along the top of the stone.\n\n\"Yes, there is a hole here about the same size as the stone, but it is\nnot more than three inches deep.\"\n\n\"Then, that stone was the bolt, Bertie. You see it was pushed up, and\nthe door then closed; and when the stone was exactly in its place, it\nwould drop into the hole and keep it from moving, and nothing short of\nbreaking up the bolt would give an entrance. It is lucky that we did\nnot push it quite to; another quarter of an inch and that bolt would\nhave fallen, and we could not have moved it unless by smashing the\nwhole thing into bits. That was why they did not quite close the stone;\nthey wanted to get in again.\"\n\n\"Here come the others!\"\n\nMaria had been washing some clothes in the stream, and they had\ntherefore been longer in coming than if she had been in the room. They\nall looked greatly excited.\n\n\"So you have found it, senor!\" Dias exclaimed in delight.\n\n\"We have found an entrance into somewhere, but I am afraid it will be\nas empty as the other chambers.\"\n\n\"Why do you think so, senor?\" Dias asked in dismay.\n\nHarry repeated the reasons he had given Bertie for his belief that the\nstone must have been left in such a position as to be easily opened\nwhen required.\n\n\"Why should it have been left so?\"\n\n\"Because the treasure they expected had never arrived. It is possible\nthat when the Incas discovered the treasure in that chamber we\nsearched, they may also have found this entrance. It may have been\nshown to them by one of the prisoners, and they may have broken the\nstone here into pieces as they broke that over the chamber afterwards.\nSeeing what a splendid hiding-place it was, they may have, when the\nSpaniards first arrived, made another stone to fit, with the intention\nof using it for a hiding-place themselves. The fact that the stone was\nleft so that it could be at once opened is conclusive proof to my mind\nthat the treasure never came. That heap of sand, small stones, and\nchips of rock is another proof that they were ready to receive\ntreasure, and it was probably swept out of the chamber that is behind\nhere, and would, of course, have been removed when the treasure was put\nin and the door closed; but as the treasure never did come, it was left\nwhere it lay. However, we will now go and see. I have only kept you\nwaiting because I did not want you to be disappointed.\"\n\nOne by one they crept through the opening. For four feet in, the\npassage was the same width as the stone, but two feet deeper; then it\nat once opened into a large cavern.\n\n\"This wall was four feet thick, you see, Dias. Apparently squared stone\nwas only used for the facing, as the stones are of irregular shape on\nthe back. This would be a natural cavern, and a splendid hiding-place\nit makes. No doubt its existence was one of the reasons for building\nthis castle.\"\n\nThe cavern was some twelve feet wide and thirty feet high at the mouth;\nthe floor sloped up sharply, and the sides contracted, and met forty\nfeet from the mouth. The floor had been cut into steps two feet wide,\nrunning across the cave and extending to the back. These steps were\nfaced with a perfectly flat slab of stone. The cave was empty.\n\nThe natives uttered loud exclamations of disappointment and regret.\n\nHarry had so thoroughly made up his mind that nothing would be found\nthere that he surveyed the place calmly and in silence. Bertie imitated\nhis example with some difficulty, for he too was bitterly disappointed.\n\n\"You see, Dias,\" Harry went on quietly, \"this place was prepared to\nreceive treasure. The steps have all been swept perfectly clean. You\nsee, the gold could be piled up, and no doubt the steps were cut and\nfaced with stone to prevent any gold-dust that might fall from the\nbags, in which, no doubt, it would be brought, and small nuggets, from\nfalling into the cracks and crevices of the rock. I should say that in\nall probability they expected that treasure ship that was lost, and had\neverything in readiness for hiding the cargo here directly it came. It\nnever did come. The door was shut as far as it could be without the\nbolt falling down and fastening it; then they waited for the ship; and\nif it did not arrive, other treasure might be brought by land. Well, it\ncannot be helped. So far we have failed. There may still be treasure\nhidden somewhere. We cannot say that we have searched the place\nthoroughly yet.\"\n\nFor another six weeks they worked hard. The wall was broken through in\nseveral places, but no signs of the existence of any other cavern or\nhiding-place was discovered.\n\n\"I should give it up,\" Harry said, when at the end of that time they\nwere sitting gloomily round the fire, \"but for one thing: I can see no\npossible explanation why a party of men should have been left here, and\na guard kept, for perhaps a hundred years, perhaps more, and the\nstories about demons been circulated, and people who ventured to\napproach been murdered, unless there had been some good reason for it.\nThat reason could only have been, as far as I can see, that there was a\ntreasure hidden here. I have turned it over and over in my mind a\nthousand times, and I can think of no other reason. Can you, Bertie, or\nyou, Dias?\"\n\n\"No,\" Bertie replied. \"I have often thought about it; but, as you say,\nthere must have been some good reason, for no people in their senses\nwould have spent their lives in this old place, and starved here,\nunless they had some cause for it.\"\n\nDias made no reply beyond shaking his head.\n\n\"You see,\" Harry went on, \"they kept up their watch to the end. There\nwere those two skeletons of men who had died at their post at that\ncurious window where nothing could be seen. I hate to give up the\nsearch, and yet we seem to have tried every point where there was a\npossibility of a hiding-place existing.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nTHE TREASURE\n\n\nThe next morning Harry said:\n\n\"I will go upstairs to that look-out place again. I have been up there\npretty nearly every day, and stared down. I can't get it out of my mind\nthat the key of the mystery lies there, and that that hole was made for\nsome other purpose than merely throwing stones out on to any of those\nwho might go in behind the rocks. I have puzzled and worried over it.\"\n\n\"Shall I come up with you, Harry?\"\n\n\"No, I would rather you didn't. I will go up by myself and spend the\nmorning there; some idea may occur to me. You may as well all have a\nquiet day of it.\"\n\nHe lit his pipe and went upstairs. Jose went off to the mules, and\nBertie descended the ladder, and strolled round what they called the\ncourtyard, looking for eggs among the rocks and in the tufts of grass\ngrowing higher up. Dias scattered a few handfuls of maize to the\nchickens and then assisted Maria to catch two of them; after which he\ndescended the ladder and sat down gloomily upon a stone. He had become\nmore and more depressed in spirits as the search became daily more\nhopeless; and although he worked as hard as anyone, he seldom spoke,\nwhile Harry and his brother often joked, and showed no outward signs of\ndisappointment. An hour passed, and then Harry appeared suddenly at the\nwindow.\n\n\"Bertie, Dias, come up at once, I have an idea!\"\n\nThey ran to the ladder and climbed up. The excitement with which he\nspoke showed that the idea was an important one. \"Now, Dias,\" he broke\nout as they joined him, \"we know, don't we, that a part of the Incas'\ntreasure was sent off by boat, and the belief of the Indians was that\nit was never heard of again.\"\n\n\"That is so, senor. There was certainly a storm the day after it\nstarted, and, as I have told you, it was never heard of again. Had it\nbeen, a report of it would surely have come down.\"\n\n\"I believe, Dias, that the boat was dashed to pieces against that line\nof rocks outside the entrance to the passage. We have reason to believe\nthat the people here were expecting the treasure to arrive, and had the\nentrance to the cave in readiness to receive it. Certainly no better\nplace could have been chosen for concealment. The boat may have been\ncoming here when the storm broke and drove them towards the shore. They\nprobably attempted to gain the mouth of the cove, but missed it, and\nwere dashed to pieces against the rocks. The Indians on guard here no\ndoubt saw it, and would be sure that the heavy sacks or boxes\ncontaining the gold would sink to the bottom. They would lie perfectly\nsecure there, even more secure than if they had been removed and placed\nin the cave, and could always be recovered when the Spaniards left, so\nthey were content to leave them there. Still, they obeyed the orders\nthey had received to keep watch for ever over the treasure, and to do\nso knocked that strange hole through the wall and always kept two men\non guard there.\n\n\"So it must have gone on. They and those who succeeded them never\nwavered. Doubtless they received food from their friends outside, or\nsome of them went out, as you have done, to fetch it in. Then came a\ntime when, for some reason or other--doubtless, as I supposed before,\nwhen the Spaniards swept pretty nearly all the natives up to work in\nthe mines, and they themselves dared not issue out--the attempt to get\nfood was made, when too late, by the men whose skeletons we found on\nthe steps when we first came here; and the rest were all too feeble to\nrepeat the experiment, and died--the two sentinels at their post, the\nrest in the room where we found them.\"\n\n\"Hurrah!\" Bertie shouted, \"I have no doubt you have hit it, Harry. I\nbelieve, after all, that we are going to find it. That is splendid! I\nshall dance at your wedding, Harry, which I had begun to think I never\nshould do.\"\n\n\"Don't be a young ass, Bertie. It is only an idea, and we have had\nseveral ideas before, but nothing has come of them.\"\n\n\"Something is going to come of this, I am convinced; I would bet any\nmoney on it. Well, shall we go and have a trial at once?\"\n\n\"What do you think, Dias?\" Harry said, paying no attention to Bertie's\nlast remark.\n\n\"I think it is quite possible, senor. Certainly, if the Indians had\nbeen told to guard the treasure, they would do so always. You know how\nthey kept the secrets entrusted to them whatever tortures they were put\nto. If the gold had been, as you say, lost amongst the rocks, I do\nthink they would have still watched the place. I thought it strange\nthat they should have made that hole, but when you said that they might\nhave made it to throw stones down it seemed to me to be likely enough;\nbut the other suggestion is more probable. Well, senor, I am ready to\ntry it, but I am not a very good swimmer.\"\n\n\"My brother and I are both good swimmers, and we will do that part of\nthe work. The hardest part will be getting it up, and you will be able\nto give us your help at that.\"\n\n\"Well, let us be off,\" Bertie said; \"I am all on thorns to begin. We\nshall soon find it out. If it is there, it is almost certain to be at\nthe foot of the rocks, though, of course, it is possible that the boat\nsank before striking them. At any rate, I feel sure she went down\nsomewhere within the area that can be seen through that hole. It won't\ntake many days' diving to search every yard of the bottom.\"\n\nThey hastily descended the ladder, and, divesting themselves of their\nclothes, swam out through the opening. Dias climbed up on the rocks,\nthe others swam round by the ends of the barrier. The water was so warm\nthat they would be able to remain in it for any time without\ninconvenience.\n\n\"We need not begin here, Bertie; we are outside the line of sight. From\nthat hole I could not see the end of these rocks. We will start at the\nmiddle, and work in opposite directions.\"\n\nOn arriving off the centre of the wall both dived. The depth was about\ntwelve feet, and as the water was perfectly clear, Harry could see four\nor five feet round him. He was obliged to swim carefully, for the\nbottom was covered with rocks, for the most part rounded by the action\nof the sea. For an hour he continued his search, by which time he had\nreached nearly the end of the line of rocks. Then he landed on a ledge\nof rock and sat down, calling to Bertie to join him.\n\n\"We will rest for a quarter of an hour,\" he said, \"and then begin\nagain. This time we will keep twenty or thirty feet farther out; it is\nmore likely to be there than close in. If the boat struck, the next\nwave would sweep over her, and she would probably go down stern first,\nand her cargo would fall out that way.\"\n\nAfter their rest they started again, swam out a few strokes, and then\ndived. Harry had gone down five or six times, when, on his coming to\nthe surface, he heard a shout, and saw Bertie swimming towards him.\n\n\"I have found them, Harry! There are a number of ingots, but they were\nso heavy that I could not bring one of them to the surface.\"\n\nAs Harry reached him the lad turned round and swam back. \"There they\nare, just opposite that cleft in the rock! I looked directly I came up\nso as to know the exact spot.\"\n\nHarry trod water for half a minute, then took a long breath and dived.\n\nIt was as Bertie had said. Scattered among the rocks were a score of\ningots. They had lost their brilliancy, but shone with a dull copperish\nhue, with bright gleams here and there where rocks had grated against\nthem. Putting one hand on a block of rock he lifted one of them with\nthe other.\n\n\"About twenty pounds,\" he said to himself. \"Thank God, Hilda is as good\nas won!\" Then he rose to the surface. \"Shake hands, Bertie; there is\nenough there to make us all rich for life. Now we will get back again.\nWe have to think matters over, and see how they are to be got ashore.\nThere is no hurry; they have lain there for three hundred years, and\nwould lie there as much longer if we did not take them. We have found\nthem, Dias!\" he shouted; and the latter gave a yell of delight. \"Swim\nashore, and we will join you there.\"\n\nNot another word was spoken until they had dressed and walked out.\n\n\"I am too excited even to think,\" Harry broke out. \"It is time for\ndinner. When we have had that and smoked a pipe I shall be able to talk\ncalmly over it.\"\n\nMaria was wild with delight at the news, and laughed and cried by\nturns. Even Jose, who was accustomed to take all things quietly, was\nalmost as excited. The woman was only called to herself when Harry\nsaid, laughing, \"Maria, for the first time since we started from Lima,\nyou are letting the dinner burn.\"\n\n\"To think of it!\" she cried. \"It is your fault, senor; you should not\nhave told me about it till we sat down.\"\n\n\"You won't have to cook much longer, Maria. You will be able now to\nhave a servant, and a house as big as you like, and a beautiful garden.\"\n\n\"I should not like that, senor; what should I do all day with myself?\"\n\n\"I am glad, senor, glad for your sake,\" Dias said gravely. \"To us it\nwill make no difference. You said there was enough there to make us\nrich. Assuredly that is so; but not one peso of it will we touch. No\nman with Indian blood in his veins, not even the poorest in Peru, would\nhave aught to do with an ounce of the Incas' treasures. When they were\nburied, a curse was laid upon any who betrayed their hiding-place or\nwho ever touched the gold. It has brought a curse upon Spain. At the\ntime the Spaniards landed here they were a great nation. Now their\nglory has departed; they no longer own the land they tyrannized over\nfor three hundred years, and we have heard that their power in Europe\nhas altogether gone. It must be the curse of the gold, or they would\nnever have allowed your great Englishman, Cochrane, with but two or\nthree ships, to conquer them here. My mind is easy as to the finding of\nthe treasure. You came here in spite of my prayers that you would not\ndo so. It is you who have made the discovery, not me. But I will take\nno share in the gold. From the day I took it I should be a cursed man;\nmy flesh would melt away, I should suffer tortures, and should die a\nmiserable death.\"\n\n\"Well, Dias, I will not try to persuade you. I know that, Christian\nthough you be, your native belief still clings to you, and I will not\nargue against it; but I have money of my own, and from that I will give\nyou enough to make you comfortable for life, and that you can take\nwithout feeling that you have incurred any curse from the finding of\nthis treasure.\"\n\n\"I thank you heartily,\" Dias said gratefully; \"I thank you with all my\nheart. I have ever been a wanderer, and now I will gladly settle down.\nI do not desire wealth, but enough to live on in comfort with my wife,\nand only to travel when it pleases me.\"\n\n\"You shall have enough for that and more, Dias.\"\n\nAfter some more meat had been cooked and eaten, and he had smoked a\npipe, Harry said: \"A boat would, of course, be the best thing, but\nthere are difficulties connected with it. There is no spot, as far as I\nknow, where we could land for fifteen miles on either side, and there\nwould only be small villages where everything we did would be seen and\ntalked about. There is no place where we could keep a boat here, for if\neven a slight breeze sprang up the swell coming in round the passage\nbetween the rocks and the cliff would smash her up in no time.\"\n\n\"That is so, senor.\"\n\nHarry was silent again for some time, and then said: \"The only plan I\ncan think of is to get some strong leather bags. Then we could take one\ndown with us when we dive, with a strong cord tied to it, put a couple\nof the ingots into it, and you could haul it up on to the rocks, and so\non until we have finished a day's work. Then we could carry them to\nthis side of the rocks; there you could put them, three or four at a\ntime, into the bag, and drop them down in the water. We would swim up\nthe tunnel and haul them in, and then bring the bag back again. We\nsha'n't be able to get anything approaching all the ingots, for a great\nmany of them must have gone in between the crevices of the rocks, and\nunless we broke it up with powder, which would be next to impossible\nwithout a diving-dress and air-pumps and all sorts of things, which\ncannot be bought in this country, we could not get at them. However, we\nhave only just begun to look for them yet; we may come across a pile.\nHeavy as the sea must be on this coast in a gale, I hardly think it\nwould much affect a pile of ingots; their weight would keep them steady\neven were big rocks rolled about.\n\n\"I think the best thing, Dias, would be for you to go off with two or\nthree mules. We shall soon be running short of provisions, and you had\nbetter get enough flour and dried meat to last us for a month. I don't\nsuppose we shall be as long as that, but it is as well to have a good\nstore so as not to have to make the journey again. Then you had better\nget twenty leather bags, such as those in which they bring the ore down\nfrom the mountains. We have plenty of stout rope, but we shall want\nsome thin cord for tying the necks of the bags. You may as well bring\nanother keg of spirits, brandy if you can get it, a bag of coffee, and\nsome sugar, and anything else you think of. Now I am a millionaire we\ncan afford to be comfortable. By the way, we might as well this\nafternoon get the rest of those silver brackets out. These are not a\npart of the Incas' treasure, and you can take them as your share\nwithout fear of the curse. It would be best for you to smelt them down;\nI know all of you natives can do that.\"\n\n\"Do you think that they are not part of the Incas' treasure, senor?\"\nDias said doubtfully.\n\n\"Certainly not; they were undoubtedly here before the Incas' time. But\neven had they been put there by Incas, you could not call them hidden\ntreasure. They might be part of the Incas' property, but certainly not\npart of the treasures they hid.\"\n\n\"But it is altogether too much, senor; it is noble of you to offer it\nme.\"\n\n\"Not at all; we owe everything we find to you, and it would be only\nfair that you should have at least a third of the gold. But still, if\nyou won't touch that, you must take the silver.\"\n\n\"But I heard you say that it was worth four thousand pounds.\"\n\n\"Well, if we are lucky we shall get twenty times as much, Dias.\"\n\n\"Certainly we will take it, senor, and grateful we shall both be to\nyou,\" Maria said; \"and so will Jose, who will inherit it all some day,\nas he is the only relative we have. I agree with Dias about the gold. I\nhave heard so often about the curse on it that I should be afraid.\"\n\n\"Well, Maria, you see there is a lot of nonsense in all your\nsuperstitions. You know it was one of them that this place was guarded\nby demons. Now you have seen for yourself that it was all humbug. If\nyou are afraid about the silver, I will take it to England and sell it\nthere and send you the money it fetches; but that would give a great\ndeal of trouble. It will be difficult to get the gold safely away,\nwithout being bothered with all this silver.\n\n\"You had better buy some bags of charcoal, Dias. I suppose you will use\nthat small hearth we have?\"\n\n\"No, senor, it would take an immense time to do it in that. I will load\none of the mules with hard bricks.\"\n\n\"You will want two mules to carry a hundred, Dias--I think they weigh\nabout four pounds and a half each. Will that be enough?\"\n\n\"Plenty, senor; but I shall want another bellows. Jose and I can work\nthe two of them, and that will make a great heat. We can melt two or\nthree hundred pounds a day. I have helped to make many a furnace up in\nthe mountains, and I know very well all about the way to build and work\nthem.\"\n\n\"Very well, then, that is settled. You had better start to-morrow\nmorning with Jose, and we will spend the day in finding out a little\nmore about the gold.\"\n\nDias started the next morning, and the two brothers were in the water\nmost of the day. Harry found, as he had expected, that a great deal of\nthe treasure had sunk out of reach between the rocks; but he came upon\none pile, which had apparently been originally packed in sacks or\nskins, lying in a heap a little farther out than they had before\nsearched. He had no doubt that this was the point where the stern of\nthe boat had sunk, and a considerable portion of the contents had been\nshot out, while the rest had been scattered about as the boat broke up,\nand as the skins rotted their contents had fallen between the rocks.\nThere were, as nearly as he could calculate, two hundred and fifty to\nthree hundred ingots in the pile.\n\n\"I need not trouble about the rest,\" he laughed to himself. \"Each\ningot, if it weighs twenty pounds, is worth a thousand. Two hundred of\nthem would make me as rich as any man can want to be. I can hardly\nbelieve in my luck; it is stupendous. Fancy a half-pay lieutenant with\ntwo hundred thousand pounds! Old Fortescue will become one of the most\ncomplaisant of fathers-in-law.\"\n\nThe evening before Dias left, Harry had written a letter for him to\npost at Callao, telling Hilda to keep up a brave heart, for that he\nhoped to be at home before the end of the second year with money enough\nto satisfy her father.\n\n\"I should not tell you so unless I felt certain of what I am saying. I\ntold you before I left that it was almost a forlorn hope that I was\nundertaking, and that the chances were ten thousand to one against me.\nI think now that the one chance has turned up, and I hope to be home\nwithin two months of the time that you receive this letter.\"\n\nHe did not say more; but even now he could scarcely believe that the\ngood fortune had befallen him, and feared that some unlucky fate might\ninterfere between him and the fulfilment of his hopes. When Dias\nreturned after two days' absence the work began. Each morning they\nworked together at bringing up the gold and piling the ingots on the\nrock. It was slower work than Harry had expected, for on hauling the\nbag to the rocks it was often caught by the boulders, and he and Bertie\nsometimes had to dive four or five times before they could free it and\nget it ashore. The gold was piled in the tunnel just beyond the water.\nIn a fortnight the last ingot they could get at was stored with its\nfellows--two hundred and eighty-two in all.\n\nThey had repeatedly talked over the best plan of getting the gold away,\nand finally concluded that it would be risking too much to take it into\na town, and that the best plan would be for Harry to buy a boat at\nCallao, which, as a naval officer, would be natural enough. They\ndecided to procure three times as many bags as the ingots would really\nrequire, and that they should put in each bag three ingots only,\nfilling it up with pieces of stone, so that the weight should not\nexceed what it would have been were the contents heavy ore. Harry\narranged that he would go down to Callao, buy a large boat, and after\nhaving made several excursions, to accustom the officials at Callao to\nseeing him going about, he would make a bargain with the captains of\ntwo ships about to sail to England, to carry about two tons each of\nore, which he could put on board them after dark, so as to avoid the\nextortion he would have to submit to before the port officials and\nothers would allow him to ship it. The question that puzzled them most\nwas the best way of taking the bags into the boat. Dias was in favour\nof their being carried on the mules to a point lower down the coast, at\nwhich they could be loaded into the boat.\n\n\"It would be only necessary to carry the gold,\" he said, \"the stones to\nfill the bags could be put in there.\"\n\nThe objection to this was that they might be observed at work, and that\nat most points it would be difficult both to run the boat up and to get\nher off again through the rollers. If the boat were brought round into\nthe inlet she could be loaded there comfortably. The only fear was of\nbeing caught in a gale. But as gales were by no means frequent the risk\nwas small; and should a sudden storm come on when she was lying there,\nand she were broken up, it would be easy to recover the gold from the\nshallow water behind the rocks. This was therefore settled. Only half\nthe treasure was to be taken away at once, and not till this had been\ngot on board a ship and the vessel had sailed would the boat come back\nfor the rest of their treasure.\n\nDias was at once to start with the mules and carry the silver, in two\njourneys, to a safe place among the mountains. There he could bury it\nin three or four hiding-places, to be fetched out as he might require\nit, only taking some fifty pounds to Lima. Here he was to dispose of a\nportion of it to one of the dealers who made it his business to buy up\nsilver from the natives. As many of these worked small mines, and sent\ndown the produce once a month to Lima, there would be nothing\nsuspicious in its being offered for sale, especially as it would be\nknown that Dias had been away for a very long time among the mountains.\nIt was necessary that the sale should be effected at once, because\nHarry's stock of money was running very low, and he would have to pay\nfor the passages of Bertie and himself to England, and for the freight\nof the gold. Dias was to dispose later on of all the remaining stores,\nthe powder and tools, and the three riding mules.\n\nTwo days later the last of the silver brackets had been melted, and\nDias and Harry started with the eight mules, six of them being laden\nwith the silver. They struck back at once into the hills, and after\ntravelling for two days, ascended a wild gorge. \"It is not once a year\nthat anyone would come up here, senor. There is no way out of it. We\ncan bury the silver here with a certainty that it will be safe from\ndisturbance.\"\n\n\"Yes, it will be safe here; and as you want it you have only to make a\njourney with a couple of mules to fetch as much as you require, carry\nit home, and bury it in your garden or under the house; then you could\nfrom time to time take a few ingots into the town and dispose of them.\nBut to begin with, I will borrow fifty pounds weight of it, and get you\nto dispose of it for me at Lima. My money is beginning to run short. I\nshall have to pay for the freight of the gold and my own passage home,\nand to buy a boat large enough to carry half the treasure. It is not\nlikely that there will be two vessels sailing at the same time, in\nwhich case I shall make two trips. As I should not put it on board\nuntil the night before the ship sailed, of course I could go home with\nthe second lot.\"\n\n\"I shall never know what to do with a tenth part of this silver, senor.\nIt would never do for me to make a show of being rich; the authorities\nwould seize me, and perhaps torture me to make me reveal the source of\nmy wealth.\"\n\n\"Well, there are thousands of your countrymen in the deepest poverty,\nDias; you could secretly help those in distress; a single ingot, ten\npounds in weight, would be a fortune to them. And when you die you\nmight get a respectable lawyer to make out a will, leaving your\ntreasure to some charity for the benefit of Indians, giving, of course,\ninstructions where the treasure is to be found.\"\n\n\"That is good,\" Dias said. \"Thank you, senor! that will make me very\nhappy.\"\n\nThey had brought a pick and shovel with them, and, dividing the bags,\nburied them at some distance apart, rolling stones to cover up the\nhiding-places, and obliterating any signs of the ground having been\ndisturbed. A hundred pounds were left out, and with this in their\nsaddle-bags they arrived at Lima two days later.\n\nHarry went on alone into Callao. He had no difficulty in purchasing a\nship's boat in fair condition. She carried two lug-sails, and was amply\nlarge enough for the purpose for which she was required, being nearly\nthirty feet long with a beam of six feet. He got her cheaply, for the\nship to which she belonged had been wrecked some distance along the\ncoast, and a portion of the crew had launched her and made their way to\nCallao; the mate, who was the sole surviving officer, was glad to\naccept the ten pounds Harry offered for her, as this would enable the\ncrew to exist until they could obtain a passage home, or ship on board\nsome British vessel short of hands. The boat was too large to be worked\nby one man, and seeing that the mate was an honest and intelligent\nfellow, Harry arranged with him to aid him to sail the boat, and each\nday they went out for some hours. After spending a week in apparent\nidleness, and getting to know more of the man, Harry told him that he\nhad really bought the boat for the purpose of getting some ore he had\ndiscovered on board a ship homeward-bound.\n\n\"You know what these Peruvians are,\" he said, \"and how jealous they are\nof our getting hold of mines, so I have got to do the thing quietly,\nand the only way will be to take the ore off by night. It is on a spot\nsome eighty miles along the coast. I am going off tomorrow to get it\nready for embarkation, and I shall be away about a week. I find that\nthe _London_ will leave in ten days, and I shall get it put on board\nthe night before she sails. While I am away, look after the boat. The\n_Nancy_ will sail five days later. I am going to put half on board each\nship, as I am anxious to ensure that some at least of the ore shall\nreach home, so as to be analysed, and see if it is as rich as I hope.\nBut be sure not to mention a word of this to a soul. I should have\nimmense trouble with the authorities if it got about that I had\ndiscovered a mine.\"\n\n\"I understand, sir. You may be quite sure I shall say nothing about it.\"\n\n\"How are your men getting on?\"\n\n\"Four are shipped on board the _Esmerelda_, which sailed yesterday, the\nothers are hanging on till they can get berths. I hope a few will be\nable to go in the two ships you name, but they haven't applied at\npresent. Some of the crew may desert before the time for sailing comes,\nand of course they would get better paid if they went as part of the\ncrew than if they merely worked their passage home.\"\n\n\"I am sorry for them,\" Harry said. \"Here is another five pounds to help\nthem to hold on. As an old naval officer I can feel for men in such a\nplace.\"\n\nDias, after selling the silver, had, a week before, returned with the\nmules to the castle, and on his arrival there had sent Jose to join\nHarry and bring news to them of the day on which the boat would arrive.\nDias and Bertie were packing half the bags, of which the former took\nwith him an ample supply, to get the gold out on the rocks facing the\nentrance, so that they could be shipped without delay. Great pains were\ntaken in packing the bags so that the three ingots placed in each\nshould be completely surrounded by stones. Anyone who might take a\nfancy to feel them, in order to ascertain their contents, would have no\nreason to suppose that they carried anything beyond the ore they were\nstated to contain.\n\nHarry had had no difficulty in arranging with the captain of the London\nto take from a ton and a half to two tons of ore the night before he\nsailed, and three days before this Harry started with the mate. There\nwas but a light breeze, and it was daylight next morning before they\narrived. A pole had been stuck up at the edge of the cliff just above\nthe cavern, and as it became dark a lantern was also placed there, so\nthey had no trouble in finding the entrance of the little cove.\n\n\"It is a rum-looking place, sir,\" the man said. \"As far as I can see\nthere is no break in the cliffs.\"\n\n\"It is a curious place, but you will find the bags with the ore on the\nrocks inside here ready for us, and my brother and one of my men\nwaiting there. They will have made us out an hour ago, so we can load\nup at once and get out of this tiny creek. I don't want to stay in\nthere any longer than is necessary, for if there is anything of a swell\nwe could not get out again.\"\n\nAs they approached the place Harry gave a shout, which was at once\nanswered. The sails were lowered, and the boat passed round the edge of\nthe rocks.\n\n\"It is a rum place,\" the mate repeated. \"Why, one might have rowed past\nhere fifty times without thinking there was water inside the rocks. Of\ncourse you must have lowered the sacks down from the top?\"\n\n\"It was a difficult job,\" Harry said carelessly; \"but we were anxious\nto get the things away quietly. If we had taken them down to the port\nwe should have had no end of bother, and a hundred men would have set\noff at once to try and find out where we got the ore.\"\n\nBertie and Dias had everything ready, and as the boat drew up alongside\nthe rocks on which they were standing the former said, \"Everything all\nright, Harry?\"\n\n\"Yes, I hope so. We are to put the ore on board the _London_ to-morrow\nafter dark; she will get up her anchor at daylight. You have got all\nthe bags ready, I hope?\"\n\n\"Everything; the others will be ready for you when you come back for\nthem.\"\n\n\"The next ship sails in about a week. Now, let us get them on board at\nonce, I don't want to stop in here a minute longer than is necessary.\nThere is scarcely a breath of wind now; if it doesn't blow up a bit in\nthe morning, we shall have a long row before us to get there in time.\nThis is my brother, Owen; the other is a mule-driver, who has been my\nguide and companion for the past year, and whom I am proud to call my\nfriend.\"\n\n\"You don't want anything in the way of food, do you?\" Bertie asked.\n\n\"We have got some here,\" Harry laughed. \"I am too old a sailor to put\nto sea without having provisions in my craft. Now, let us get the bags\non board.\"\n\nIt did not take them long to transfer the sacks into the boat.\n\n\"They are pretty heavy,\" the mate said, \"I should say a hundredweight\neach.\"\n\n\"About that,\" Harry said carelessly. \"This ore stuff is very heavy.\"\n\nAs soon as all was on board Harry said: \"Now we can put out at any\nmoment, but I don't want to leave till dark. We may as well begin to\nget the rest of the bags out here at once. We might finish that job\nbefore we start. Then you could come down with us, Bertie, and Dias\ncould pack up the remaining stores to-morrow and start for Lima with\nthe mules, and his wife and Jose.\n\n\"Very well, Harry. I think we can leave the sacks here safely.\"\n\n\"Just as safely as if they were ashore. So far as we know no one has\nbeen in here for the past two hundred years, and no one is likely to\ncome in the next week.\"\n\nBy evening all the work was done. The mate had been greatly surprised\nat the manner in which the bags had been brought on board, but had\nhelped in the work and asked no questions. As soon as it was dark they\nrowed out from the cove. There was not a breath of wind. Bertie\nvolunteered to take the first watch, the mate was to take the next.\n\nHarry was not sorry to turn in. He had had but little sleep for the\npast week. Everything had seemed to be going well, but at any moment\nthere might be some hitch in the arrangements, and he had been anxious\nand excited. Wrapping himself in his poncho he lay down in the stern of\nthe boat and slept soundly until morning.\n\n\"I have had a sleep,\" he said on waking. \"I have slept longer to-night\nthan I have done for the past fortnight. Now I will take the helm. How\nfast have we been moving?\"\n\n\"We have not gone many miles, and if what tide there is hadn't been\nwith us we should not have moved at all, for the sails have not been\nfull all night. A breeze only sprang up an hour ago, and we are not\nmoving through the water now at more than a knot and a half; but I\nthink it is freshening.\"\n\n\"I hope it is,\" Harry said. \"It is not often that we have a dead calm;\nbut if it doesn't spring up we shall have to row. With two tons and a\nhalf of stuff on board it is as much as we can do to move two knots an\nhour through the water.\"\n\n\"All right, sir! when you think it is time to begin, stir me up.\"\n\nIn half an hour the breeze had increased so much that the boat was\nrunning along three knots an hour. By eight o'clock she was doing a\nknot better. So she ran along till, at four o'clock in the afternoon,\nthe wind died away again, and they could just see the masts of the\nships at Callao in the distance.\n\n\"I should think that we are about fifteen miles off,\" Harry said.\n\n\"About that,\" Bertie replied. \"We had better get our oars and help her\nalong, she is not going much more than a knot through the water an\nhour.\"\n\nThey got out the oars and set to work. Occasionally a puff of wind gave\nthem a little assistance, but it was one o'clock before they arrived\nalongside the _London_.\n\nA lamp was alight at the gangway as arranged, and two sailors were on\nwatch.\n\n\"The captain turned in an hour ago, sir,\" one of them said. \"He left\norders that the mate was to call him if you arrived. We will soon have\nhim up.\"\n\nIn five minutes the mate and four other sailors were on deck.\n\n\"We have got a whip rigged in readiness,\" the officer said. \"How much\ndo the packages weigh, sir?\"\n\n\"They are leathern bags, and weigh about a hundredweight each.\"\n\n\"How many are there?\"\n\n\"Forty-six.\"\n\n\"We have got the fore-hatch open, and can hand them down in no time. If\nyou will pass the boat along to the chains forward we shall be ready\nfor you. Shall I send a couple of hands down into the boat to hook them\non?\"\n\n\"No, you needn't do that.\"\n\nAs soon as the boat reached her station a rope with a couple of small\nchains attached descended. One of the chains was fastened round a bag,\nand this was at once run up. By the time the rope came down again the\nother chain was passed round another bag, and in a quarter of an hour\nthe whole were on board and down in the hold. The captain had now come\nout.\n\n\"So you have got them off all right, Mr. Prendergast?\"\n\n\"Yes. There are forty-six bags. We will say, roughly, two ton and a\nhalf; though I doubt whether there is as much as that. At any rate, I\nwill pay you for the freight agreed upon at once. They have all got\nlabels on them, and on your arrival, after being handed into store, are\nto remain till called for. I am coming on in the _Nancy_. I do not know\nwhether she is faster than you are or not. At any rate, she is not\nlikely to be long behind you.\"\n\n\"I think that possibly you will be home first, sir; the _Nancy_ made\nthe voyage out here a fortnight quicker than we did; but it depends, of\ncourse, on what weather we meet with. I was on board her this\nafternoon, and her captain and I made a bet of five pounds each as to\nwhich would be in the port of London first. I shall have the anchor up\nby daylight. Now, gentlemen, will you come down into the cabin and we\nwill take a glass together.\"\n\nHarry did so, and after emptying a tumbler and wishing the captain a\nquick and pleasant voyage, he got into the boat and rowed two or three\nmiles along the shore, as a landing at that time of night might cause\nquestions to be asked; and then they lay down and slept by turns until\nmorning broke. A light breeze then sprang up, and hoisting sail they\nreturned to Callao. The _London_ was already far out at sea.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nHOME\n\n\nTwo days later, Dias, Jose, and Maria arrived at Callao, having left\nthe mules at Lima.\n\n\"Was it got off all right, senor?\" Dias asked.\n\n\"Yes. It was a pretty near touch, for we had to row nine hours, and\nonly saved our time by an hour.\"\n\n\"And when will you start again?\"\n\n\"The _Nancy_ sails in four days, so I shall go down tomorrow morning. I\ndon't want to run the risk again of losing the boat.\"\n\n\"Well, we shall be stronger handed,\" Bertie said. \"Of course I shall go\ndown with you; Dias says he will too; so we will be able to man four\noars, if necessary.\"\n\n\"What have you done with the goods?\" Harry asked.\n\n\"I sold them all at Lima, senor, to the man I got them from. He took\noff a third of the price, and said he could not have taken them if it\nhad not been that he had just got an order down from the Cerro mines,\nand was short of some of the things they had ordered.\"\n\n\"That is all right, Dias.\"\n\nHarry secured two rooms at the hotel, and they all sat talking far into\nthe night. \"I hope you will get your silver down as comfortably as we\nhave got the gold.\"\n\n\"I have no fear about doing that, senor. The difficulty will be for me\nto know what to do with it. I can never spend so much.\"\n\n\"Oh, nonsense, Dias!\"\n\n\"I mean it, senor. Maria and I are quite agreed that we don't want any\nlarger house than we have got; and I know that if we did want a big\none, there would be all sorts of questions as to where I had got the\nmoney from.\"\n\n\"There would be no difficulty in answering that, Dias. You told me how\nyour friend found five mule-loads of silver in the bats' cave. You have\nonly got to say that you found yours hidden away, which would be the\ntruth. Jose is nineteen now, and you will want to provide him with some\ngood mules, and to put by some money for him when he wants to marry and\nsettle. I know you spoke very highly of an institution at Lima for the\norphans of natives. You can hand them over some, and when you and Maria\ndon't want it any longer you can leave them the rest.\"\n\nMaria cried bitterly in the morning when they said goodbye. \"I shall\nlove you and pray for you always, senors,\" she sobbed. \"I shall never\nforget all your kindness.\"\n\n\"We owe you more than you owe us,\" Harry said. \"You have always been\nready to do everything, and you have kept us alive with your merry talk\nand good spirits. You may be very sure that we shall never forget you.\"\n\nJose was almost equally affected. \"You will never come back, senor,\" he\nsaid, as the tears rolled down his cheeks.\n\n\"I may some day, Jose. I think it likely that I shall some day get up a\ncompany to drain that lake in the golden valley. The gold will be more\nuseful as money than lying there. It must depend partly upon whether\nthe country is settled. People will not put money into Peru as long as\nyou are always fighting here.\"\n\nMaria and Jose would have accompanied them down to the boat the next\nmorning, but Dias pointed out to them that they were apparently only\ngoing out for a day's sail, and that if there were any partings on the\nshore it would at once attract the suspicions of the customs-house\nofficials there.\n\nAccordingly, after a painful farewell, Dias and the two brothers went\ndown to the boat, where the mate was already awaiting them. The voyage\nwas as successful as the previous one had been. On the return journey\nthe wind held, and they arrived alongside of the _Nancy_ by eleven\no'clock; the bags were all safely in the hold by midnight. The first\nmate of the ship had two days before been taken with fever and sent\nashore, and the captain had gladly accepted the offer of Harry's\nassistant to take the berth of second mate, that officer having\nsucceeded to the post of the first. Harry had told him that he could\nsell the boat, and he had, before starting on the trip, done so, on the\nunderstanding that it would be found on the beach in charge of Dias\nwhen the _Nancy_ had sailed.\n\nHarry had given him another ten pounds to provide himself with an\noutfit, and had also asked him to distribute twenty among his former\nshipmates for the same purpose, as these had lost all their clothing\nexcept what they stood in. The ship's dinghy, with a couple of hands,\ntowed the boat, with Dias in it, to the shore. The muleteer was greatly\naffected at parting with Harry and his brother.\n\n\"It has been a fortunate journey for us both,\" Dias said, \"and I shall\nalways look back to the time we spent together with the greatest\npleasure.\"\n\n\"Here is a piece of paper with my address in London. I know that you\nwill have no difficulty in getting letters written for you. Let me hear\nfrom you once every six months or so, telling me how you are getting\non, and I will write to you. Good-bye! We shall always remember you,\nand be thankful that we had so faithful a guide here, and, I may say,\nso faithful a friend.\"\n\nThe voyage home was an uneventful one, save that they met with a heavy\nstorm while rounding the Horn, and for some days the vessel was in\ngreat danger. However, she weathered it safely, and when she arrived in\nthe Thames she found that the _London_ had come up on the previous tide.\n\n\"If it hadn't been for that storm we should have beaten her easily,\"\nthe captain said. \"But I don't mind losing that fiver, considering that\nwe have gained four days on her.\"\n\nOn landing, Harry went straight to the Bank of England and informed the\nmanagers that he had two hundred and eighty-two ingots of gold,\nweighing about twenty pounds each, which he wished to deposit in their\nvaults until they could weigh them and place their value to his credit,\nand he requested them to send down one of their waggons to the docks\nthe next day to receive them. On the following evening he had the\nsatisfaction of knowing that the whole of the treasure was at last in\nsafe-keeping. Then he took a hackney-coach and drove to Jermyn Street,\nwhere he had taken rooms, having the night before carried there the\ntrunks which he had stored before he left England. He smiled as he\nspread out suit after suit.\n\n\"I don't know anything about the fashions now,\" he said, \"and for aught\nI can tell they may have changed altogether. However, I don't suppose\nthere will be such an alteration that I shall look as if I had come out\nof the ark. Certainly I am not going to wait till I get a new outfit.\n\n\"It did not seem to me,\" he said to himself, \"that I left a\nridiculously large wardrobe before I went. But after knocking about for\ntwo years with a single change, it really does seem absurd that I\nshould ever have thought I absolutely required all these things. Now, I\nsuppose I had better write to the old man and say that I have returned,\nand shall call upon him to-morrow. The chances are ten to one against\nmy catching him in now, and as this is rather a formal sort of\nbusiness, I had better give him due notice; but I cannot keep Hilda in\nsuspense. I wonder whether she has the same maid as she had before I\nwent away. I have given the girl more than one half-guinea, and to do\nher justice I believe that she was so attached to her mistress that she\nwould have done anything for her without them. Still, I can't very well\nknock at the door and ask for Miss Fortescue's maid; I expect I must\ntrust the note to a footman. If she does not get it, there is no harm\ndone; if he hands it to her father, no doubt it would put him in a\ntowering rage, but he will cool down by the time I see him in the\nmorning.\"\n\nHe sat down and wrote two notes. The first was to Mr. Fortescue; it\nonly said:--\n\n\"Dear Sir,--I have returned from abroad, and shall do myself the\npleasure of calling upon you at eleven o'clock tomorrow morning to\ndiscuss with you a matter of much importance to myself.\"\n\nThe note to Hilda was still shorter:--\n\n\"My darling,--I am home and am going to call on your father at eleven\no'clock tomorrow morning. I am two months within the two years.--Yours\ndevotedly,\n\n\"HARRY PRENDERGAST.\"\n\nHaving sealed both letters, he walked to Bedford Square. When the door\nopened, he saw that the footman was one of those who had been in Mr.\nFortescue's service before he left.\n\n\"You have not forgotten me, Edward, have you?\"\n\n\"Why, it is Mr. Prendergast! Well, sir, it is a long time since we saw\nyou.\"\n\n\"Yes, I have been abroad. Will you hand this letter to Mr. Fortescue.\nIs he in at present?\"\n\n\"No, sir; he and Mrs. Fortescue are both out. Miss Fortescue is out\ntoo.\"\n\n\"Well now, Edward, will you hand this letter quietly to Miss Fortescue\nwhen she comes in?\" and he held out the note and a guinea with it.\n\nThe man hesitated.\n\n\"You need not be afraid of giving it to her,\" Harry went on. \"It is\nonly to tell her what I have told your master in my letter to him, that\nI am going to call tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Then I shall be glad to do it,\" the man said--for, as usual, the\nservants were pretty well acquainted with the state of affairs, and\nwhen Harry went away, and their young mistress was evidently in\ndisgrace with her father, they guessed pretty accurately what had\nhappened, and their sympathies were with the lovers. Harry returned to\nJermyn Street confident that Hilda would get his note that evening. He\nhad no feeling of animosity against her father, It was natural that, as\na large land-owner, and belonging to an old family, and closely\nconnected with more than one peer of the realm, he should offer strong\nopposition to the marriage of his daughter to a half-pay lieutenant,\nand he had been quite prepared for the burst of anger with which his\nrequest for her hand had been received. He had felt that it was a\nforlorn hope; but he and Hilda hoped that in time the old man would\nsoften, especially as they had an ally in her mother. Hilda had three\nbrothers, and as the estates and the bulk of Mr. Fortescue's fortune\nwould go to them, she was not a great heiress, though undoubtedly she\nwould be well dowered.\n\nOn arriving the next morning Harry was shown into the library. Mr.\nFortescue rose from his chair and bowed coldly.\n\n\"To what am I indebted for the honour of this visit, Mr. Prendergast? I\nhad hoped that the emphatic way in which I rejected your--you will\nexcuse my saying--presumptuous request for the hand of my daughter,\nwould have settled the matter once and for all; and I trust that your\nrequest for an interview to-day does not imply that you intend to renew\nthat proposal, which I may say at once would receive, and will receive\nas long as I live, the same answer as I before gave you.\"\n\n\"It has that object, sir,\" Harry said quietly, \"but under somewhat\nchanged conditions. I asked you at that time to give me two years, in\nwhich time possibly my circumstances might change. You refused to give\nme a single week; but your daughter was more kind, and promised to wait\nfor the two years, which will not be up for two more months.\"\n\n\"She has behaved like a froward and obstinate girl,\" her father said\nangrily. \"She has refused several most eligible offers, and I have to\nthank you for it. Well, sir, I hope at least that you have the grace to\nfeel that it is preposterous that you should any longer stand in the\nway of this misguided girl.\"\n\n\"I have come to say that if it is her wish and yours that I should\nstand aside, as you say, I will do so, and in my letters I told her\nthat unless circumstances should be changed before the two years have\nexpired I would disappear altogether from her path.\"\n\n\"That is something at least, sir,\" Mr. Fortescue said with more\ncourtesy than he had hitherto shown. \"I need not say that there is no\nprospect of your obtaining my consent, and may inform you that my\ndaughter promised not to withstand my commands as far as you are\nconcerned beyond the expiration of the two years. I do not know that\nthere is anything more to say.\"\n\n\"I should not have come here, sir, had there not been more to say, but\nshould simply have addressed a letter to you saying that I withdrew all\npretensions to your daughter's hand. But I have a good deal more to\nsay. I have during the time that I have been away succeeded in\nimproving my condition to a certain extent.\"\n\n\"Pooh, pooh, sir!\" the other said angrily. \"Suppose you made a thousand\nor two, what possible difference could it make?\"\n\n\"I am not foolish enough to suppose that it would do so; but at least\nthis receipt from the Bank of England, for gold deposited in their\nhands, will show you that the sums you mention have been somewhat\nexceeded.\"\n\n\"Tut, tut, I don't wish to see it! it can make no possible difference\nin the matter.\"\n\n\"At least, sir, you will do me the courtesy to read it, or if you\nprefer not to do so I will read it myself.\"\n\n\"Give it me,\" Mr. Fortescue said, holding out his hand. \"Let us get\nthrough this farce as soon as possible; it is painful to us both.\"\n\nHe put on his spectacles, glanced at the paper, and gave a sudden\nstart, read it again, carefully this time, and then said slowly:\n\n\"Do you mean that the two hundred and eighty-two ingots, containing in\nall five thousand six hundred and forty pounds weight of gold, are your\nproperty? That is to say, that you are the sole owner of them, and not\nonly the representative of some mining company?\"\n\n\"It is the sole property, Mr. Fortescue, of my brother and myself. I\nown two-thirds of it. It is lost treasure recovered by us from the sea,\nwhere it has been lying ever since the conquest of Peru by Pizarro.\"\n\n\"There is no mistake about this? The word pounds is not a mistake for\nounces?--although even that would represent a very large sum.\"\n\n\"The bank would not be likely to make such a mistake as that, sir. The\ningots weigh about twenty pounds each. I had a small piece of the gold\nassayed at Callao, and its value was estimated at four pounds per\nounce. Roughly, then, the value of the sum deposited at the bank is two\nhundred and seventy thousand pounds.\"\n\n\"Prodigious!\" Mr. Fortescue murmured.\n\n\"Well, Mr. Prendergast, I own that you have astounded me. It would be\nabsurd to deny that this altogether alters the position. Against you\npersonally I have never had anything to say. You were always a welcome\nvisitor to my house till I saw how matters were tending. Your family,\nlike my own, is an old one, and your position as an officer in the\nKing's Naval Service is an honourable one. However, I must ask you to\ngive me a day to reflect over the matter, to consult with my wife, and\nto ascertain that my daughter's disposition in the matter is unchanged.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir! But I trust that you will allow me to have an\ninterview with Miss Fortescue now. It is two years since we parted, and\nshe has suffered great anxiety on my account, and on the matter of my\nsafety at least I would not keep her a moment longer in suspense.\"\n\n\"I think that after the turn the matter has taken your request is a\nreasonable one. You are sure to find her in the drawing-room with her\nmother at present. I think it is desirable that you should not see her\nalone until the matter is formally arranged.\"\n\nPrendergast bowed.\n\n\"I am content to wait,\" he said with a slight smile.\n\n\"I will take you up myself,\" the other said.\n\nHarry could have done without the guidance, for he knew the house well.\nHowever, he only bowed again, and followed the old man upstairs.\n\nThe latter opened the door and said to his wife: \"My dear, I have\nbrought an old friend up to see you;\" and as Harry entered he closed\nthe door and went down to the library again.\n\n\"Nearly two hundred thousand pounds!\" he said. \"A splendid fortune!\nNearly twice as much as I put by before I left the bar. How in the\nworld could he have got it? 'Got it up out of the sea,' he said; a\ncurious story. However, with that acknowledgment from the bank there\ncan be no mistake about it. Well, well, it might be worse. I always\nliked the young fellow till he was fool enough to fall in love with\nHilda, and worse still, she with him. The silly girl might have had a\ncoronet. However, there is no accounting for these things, and I am\nglad that the battle between us is at an end. I was only acting for her\ngood, and I should have been mad to let her throw herself away on a\npenniless officer on half-pay.\"\n\nMrs. Fortescue waved her hand as Harry, on entering, was about to speak\nto her.\n\n\"Go to her first,\" she said; \"she has waited long enough for you.\"\n\nAnd he turned to Hilda.\n\nHe made a step towards her and held out his arms, and with a little cry\nof joy she ran into them.\n\n\"And is it all right?\" she said a minute later. \"Can it really be all\nright?\"\n\n\"You may be quite sure that it is all right, Hilda,\" Mrs. Fortescue\nsaid. \"Do you think your father would have brought him up here if it\nhadn't been? Now you can come to me, Harry.\"\n\n\"I am glad,\" she said heartily. \"We have had a very bad time. Now,\nthank God, it is all over. You see she has only had me to stand by her,\nfor her brothers, although they have not taken open part against her,\nhave been disposed to think that it was madness her wasting two years\non the chance of your making a fortune. Of course you have done so, or\nyou would not be in this drawing-room at present.\"\n\n\"I have done very well, Mrs. Fortescue. I was able to show Mr.\nFortescue a receipt for gold amounting to nearly three hundred thousand\npounds, of which two-thirds belong to me, the rest to my brother.\"\n\nMrs. Fortescue uttered an exclamation of astonishment.\n\n\"What have you been doing, Harry?\" she asked--\"plundering a Nabob?\"\n\n\"Nabobs do not dwell in Peru,\" he laughed. \"No, I have discovered a\nlong-lost treasure, which, beyond any doubt, was part of the wealth of\nAtahualpa, the unfortunate monarch whom Pizarro first plundered and\nthen slew. It had been sent off by sea, and the vessel was lost. It is\ntoo long a story to tell now.\"\n\n\"And Papa has quite consented, Harry?\"\n\nHarry smiled.\n\n\"Virtually so, as you might suppose by his bringing me up here.\nActually he has deferred the matter, pending a consultation with you\nand Mrs. Fortescue, and will give me his formal answer to-morrow.\"\n\nThe two ladies both smiled.\n\n\"If he said that, the matter is settled,\" the elder said; \"he has never\nasked my opinion before on the subject, and I have never volunteered\nit. But I am sure he has not the slightest doubt as to what I thought\nof it. So we can consider it as happily settled after all. If I had\nthought that there was the slightest chance of your making a fortune\nquickly I should have spoken out; but as I thought it absolutely\nhopeless, I have done what I could privately to support Hilda, always\nsaying, however, that if at the end of the two years nothing came of\nit, I could not in any way countenance her throwing away the chances of\nher life.\"\n\n\"You were quite right, Mrs. Fortescue. I had fully intended to write to\nHilda at the end of that time releasing her from all promises that she\nhad made to me, and saying that I felt that I had no right to trouble\nher further; but from what she wrote to me, I doubt whether her father\nwould have found her altogether amenable to his wishes even at the end\nof the two years.\"\n\nA month later there was a wedding in Bedford Square. Among those\npresent no one was more gratified than Mr. Barnett, whose surprise and\nsatisfaction were great when Harry told him in confidence the result of\nhis advice, and especially of his introduction to the Indian guide.\n\nIt had been arranged that nothing should be said as to the source from\nwhich Harry had obtained his wealth, as it was possible that the\nPeruvian government might set up some claim to it, and it was in Mr.\nFortescue's opinion very doubtful what the result would be, as it had\nbeen discovered so close to the shore.\n\nHarry never took any steps with reference to the gold valley, for the\nconstant troubles in Peru were sufficient to deter any wealthy men from\ninvesting money there.\n\nThe correspondence between him and Dias and his wife was maintained\nuntil they died full of years and greatly lamented by numbers of their\ncountrymen to whom they had been benefactors.\n\nBertie never went to sea again except in his own yacht, but when he\ncame of age, bought an estate near Southampton, and six years later\nbrought home a mistress for it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Treasure of the Incas, by G.
