    "text": "Curacao is an island in the Caribbean, off of the Venezuelan Coast. It is also a constituent country of the Netherlands. I had to google it and if you look at photos of the island, it looks stunning.\n\nI wanted to find out about Curacao as I received an email from a lady who lives there. She thanked me for a 'wonderful book' and said she would be passing it on. It would be nice to get a small fan base in Curacao and I really appreciated the time she took to write.\n\nI hope more people choose to pass on 'An Extra-Ordinary Beginning'. Word of mouth is so important and really helps in, unsurprisingly, spreading the word! I was discussing this with a friend who runs Prague Youth Theatre who told me how this has really helped him.\n\nFor the last two weeks, I have written nothing (this will change on Monday). The editing of \u2018Survival Instinct\u2019 is ongoing and my editor continues to smile at me so I am taking this as a good sign. The factory work I refer to in the Blog title has all been computer based. At the moment, not enough people know about \u2018The Adventures of Eric and Ursula\u2019 and this must change if I am to succeed. The only way this will change is to contact people and tell them that this great book exists. Over the last eight working days, I have visited numerous school sites to find out who teaches English and their email addresses. As right now, I have 422 contacts who I need to email. Collecting these email, trawling through websites, has been laborious and I call it factory work. So, how did I survive:\n\nI gave myself a break every 50 minutes\n\nI broke up the monotony with some exercise to let my frustration out!\n\nI gave myself a reward e.g. when I have collected another 50 emails I will get a sweet\n\nThese may sound simple and childish but they work for me. If I just email my new contacts and say here is a book for you to buy, my email will be deleted by them before they read it. To try to stop this, I am offering these teachers and librarians some super free reading activities that they can do with their students. I am also offering them \u2018An Extra-Ordinary Beginning\u2019 for free. If 10% of my contacts download my book and visit my website then I will consider this marketing strategy successful.\n\nIt is important to relax or to take a break. I know that sounds obvious but I am bad at doing this, and I doubt I am alone. Often, I become so absorbed in what I am doing - writing, marketing, drafting - that before I know it, hours have passed. In 'How to set up an online business', Kevin Partner gives 5 tips to succeed. The first five are quite standard:\n\nDo what you love, love what you do\n\nNever stop learning\n\nWork on the business, not just in the business\n\nAlways look on the bright side of life\n\nWork your nuts off\n\nHowever, it his bonus tip that I have found most useful:\n\nGet a dog\n\nThe point he is making is that a dog will mean you will exercise, will lower your blood pressure and will force you to take a break from what you are doing. It is during these breaks that he claims he has his best ideas. I agree with him. While running or cycling or cooking, my thoughts become clearer and suddenly ideas pop into my head that I would not have had if I had been sat at my computer.\n\nA few years ago, I went to see an exhibition of Monet's Water Lilies in London. One canvas was large (I think about 3 metres by 3 metres) and I stood right in front of it, just a few centimetres away. I could see nothing which isn't a surprise but when I stepped back and sat down, removed from the painting, I could take it all in and notice more detail that I had previously missed.\n\nLast week I stepped back from my work, had a break for five days. Consequently, I have come back fresher, with more ideas and I am more perceptive."
