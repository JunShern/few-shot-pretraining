    "text": "\u2018We Have A Lot to Say\u2019: A Moment with Zach Velmer\n\nJust a couple of months after releasing their newest album, The Universe Inside, STS9 recently embarked on their 2016 fall tour. This intergalactic planetary, mind-bending, core-shaking band just keeps getting better every year; every show; every day. The music they create not only inspires, but radiates this metaphysical energy that has the ability to awaken and transform your soul. Tribe is so progressive and dynamic that, no matter how many times you\u2019ve seen them live, you always get something new and profound out of every show; and you always want more. There are literally no limitations to what this transcendent quintet (and Saxton) can accomplish. Before kicking off their fall tour, we got a chance to chat with Zach Velmer \u2014STS9\u2019s spirited and talented drummer \u2014 about the new album, touring, and interpersonal experiences.\n\nImage: Aaron Bradley\n\nSensible Reason: Regarding STS9\u2019s new album, The Universe Inside, a lot of people are saying it\u2019s a bit of a change in direction from Tribe\u2019s usual sound, what would you say to that?\n\nZach Velmer: We have been getting a, \u201cthis is an interesting departure from what you normally do\u2026 having vocals,\u201d response. I have to be honest, I kind of disagree because if you go back to every record we\u2019ve put out, there\u2019s vocals\u2026 on Artifacts, Peaceblaster, When The Dust Settles. There\u2019s even vocals on Offered Schematics, so within that, this is just a continuation of what we have been doing and what we\u2019ve been a part of\u2026 and we feel that. We didn\u2019t feel like, \u201cOkay, we\u2019re gonna go in this different direction, we have this concept,\u201d it was never like that. The idea was just a continuation of what we\u2019ve been creating with Alana, musically\u2026 together. It\u2019s a continuation of where we were, where we are, and where we\u2019re going. We definitely wanted the listeners to totally recognize and hear each individual player, and that was a huge thing that we really sought after. It took us a long time because we work with electronics and do all this other stuff. As far as the vocals, it was a process of continuously working with different artists and collaborations and we had always done that since\u2026 forever. This [The Universe Inside] was pushing what we know and \u2013 to be perfectly honest \u2013 we have a lot to say.\n\nSR: Yeah, you definitely can\u2019t be stuck in a box as an artist even though some fans might not be as crazy about a perceived change in direction to them.\n\nZV: Definitely. As artists, we have the ability and freedom to NOT put out what we\u2019ve put out the last six years. We\u2019re able to push the envelope as artists, be creative, and do what we want to do. We\u2019re definitely not looking at what we DID do. We absolutely don\u2019t want to do that again\u2026 because we already fucking did it!\n\nSR: Well, you\u2019re always evolving, that\u2019s the whole point of being an artist.\n\nZV: Yeah, when we\u2019re writing songs and what\u2019s in our head, it\u2019s not like there\u2019s this overlying, \u201cOkay, cool. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re gonna do and we\u2019re gonna fuck everybody up!\u201d No\u2026 it\u2019s all inspiration. You\u2019re literally pulling something from nothing; you\u2019re creating music from nothing. So you just start and it just perpetuates, and the energy starts flowing and you have these vibes. It\u2019s a collaboration and a creative expression. It comes from the camaraderie of us being in the studio together and bouncing ideas off each other. It\u2019s just a beautiful thing that we get to do and we\u2019re incredibly blessed that people love what we do. It\u2019s just such a dichotomy of being in the studio and then doing it live. To sum it up, we wanted our fans to be able to \u2013 more than hear us \u2013FEEL us.\n\nSR: Speaking of feeling you all, the transference of energy at live shows is extremely palpable. Has there ever been a moment where you felt that intense connection with the crowd from the energy that is being exchanged?\n\nZV: Absolutely. More times than not. I have incredible moments of that kind of connection. I use the word \u201cSymbiotic\u201d because it is literally that. I\u2019ve said it when I speak to the crowd, like these moments of just getting real. It\u2019s such a neat thing that we get to do this together. We can\u2019t just get up there and have that incredible movement of energy through all of us without everyone else in there. We play in the studio and create awesome music, but when we play in front of people\u2026 I long for that continuously. It\u2019s not an addiction, but it\u2019s just a longing for that transfer of energy and sharing it with other humans.\n\nImage: Aaron Bradley\n\nSR: A lot of people have a strong emotional reaction at Tribe\u2019s live shows. Has there ever been a moment where you were on stage and had a reaction like that and had a hard time holding it together?\n\nZV: Absolutely. 100%. I\u2019ve had some crazy out-of-body experiences through the energy and the music, yeah. It\u2019s not like few and far in between, but when it links up like that \u2014 in one single moment \u2014 it\u2019s pretty rad.\n\nSR: Going off that, how do you feel when you hear that the music you all create literally changes people\u2019s lives and perceptions?\n\nZV: Straight up, THAT is why we do what we do. It\u2019s why we keep coming back for more; because of that. More times than not, I hear, \u201cWhen I found you guys, it changed my life trajectory. I was going this way, now I\u2019m going this way\u2026 because of you.\u201d And I\u2019m like well\u2026 it\u2019s not really because of us, but if you want to say that\u2019s a catalyst, that\u2019s beautiful; but it\u2019s because of THEM. That\u2019s the connection that it all brings together. That\u2019s the magic.\n\nSR: Some people want to know, during your tours, what determines where you guys play? Because it\u2019s inevitable, every year, there are people who are sad you aren\u2019t playing near them.\n\nZV: I\u2019d like to take credit for that but we have people who do it for us [laughs]. It\u2019s definitely calculated. There\u2019s so many considerations and variables. BUT, we do consider fan input on locations. Like, people want us to play in a certain area and we try our best to make it happen, absolutely. Whether or not it logistically sometimes works\u2026 but we do consider that. But ya know, in a fall tour, there\u2019s only so much time so we obviously cannot go everywhere.\n\nSR: Unless you have a teleportation device, which would be rad.\n\nZV: That would be cool. Yeah, we\u2019re working on that\u2026 that\u2019s why we can\u2019t tour so much because we\u2019re working on that teleportation device.\n\nImage: Joshua Skolnik\n\nSR: Well, you\u2019ll be the first band to play on the moon so it\u2019s all good.\n\nZV: I hope so.\n\nSR: What would you say is your favorite city (or cities) to play?\n\nZV: That\u2019s like asking what my favorite pair of shoes are\u2026\n\nSR: Well, the band did originate in Georgia\u2026\n\nZV: Yeah! I LOVE going to Georgia, but also, going to Georgia is like a family reunion\u2026 it\u2019s craaaaazy. It\u2019s like, people that you haven\u2019t seen in years come out of the woodworks; that\u2019s why I love that. But, I gotta be honest, I love going everywhere. Our management asks us for our tour quotes, and I start writing it and it\u2019s not only a quote, it\u2019s a fucking novel. It\u2019s all exciting. I\u2019m truly stoked about it all.\n\nSR: What STS9 songs really get you amped and you really love playing live?\n\nZV: Right now, a lot of the new stuff is really fun to play\u2026 because it\u2019s new. And where the new stuff is gonna go \u2014 and the exploration of the new stuff \u2014 is incredibly intriguing and inspiring. I\u2019ve been working the sets for the tour and looking at all the songs and it\u2019s like, \u201cOh my God! I forgot about that song!\u201d So I write it in the setlist and it\u2019s exciting. Some of the older stuff is as fulfilling as the new stuff because you can breathe some new life into it since you haven\u2019t played it in a while. There are also those moments of playing a song that you\u2019ve been playing for a while, but all of a sudden, because of the night, the venue and the people, that song goes to this new place. It\u2019s the constant ebb and flow of change and it\u2019s magical. If the music takes us, we\u2019ll go there.\n\nImage: Aaron Bradley\n\nSR: Hulaween is coming up VERY soon and STS9 is almost always on the bill for SCI-dominated festivals. What is Tribe\u2019s relationship with The String Cheese Incident and will we see an on-stage collaboration soon?\n\nZV: We are long-time friends of Cheese. We have collaborated with Cheese during Horning\u2019s Hideout and the old-school days and it\u2019s a beautiful thing that we\u2019ve been friends with all those guys. Michael Kang lives in Santa Cruz and we actually play a lot of golf together, so we\u2019re all buds. As far as this year, I don\u2019t know\u2026 we\u2019ll see. I know they do a lot of prep for their shows because they incorporate a lot of performance art and special effects, so I\u2019m not quite sure about this year, but I always look forward to potentially collaborating with them again.\n\nSR: Maureen Murphy has an awesome voice and has been a guest vocalist with the band in previous years, but on The Universe Inside she is very prevalent. What is the band\u2019s relationship with her and will she be integrated more regularly during future shows?\n\nZV: That\u2019s TBD. We love working with Maureen and she is a dear friend of ours. That connection has been blossoming, hence why we started working with her more. We are just super open. It\u2019s incredibly inspiring and fun to do that stuff. As for it being a regular thing, we don\u2019t know. We enjoy it and we welcome it, and we hope everybody else enjoys it because it\u2019s different. We\u2019re able to do things that maybe doesn\u2019t make that much sense for an instrumental band to do, but when we have vocalists we\u2019re able to do some really cool, fun things. We fuckin\u2019 did Queen and David Bowie\u2019s \u201cUnder Pressure\u201d because we had a vocalist and choir. Those types of things open the door for so much fun stuff.\n\nSR: Let\u2019s talk about Tribe\u2019s lighting design for a second. Obviously, Saxton is a genius and the evolution of the lightshows has been mind blowing. Does the band have any input on the lighting or is it all pure Saxton magic?\n\nZV: It\u2019s absolutely a collaboration, but yes, Saxton is 100% a badass. He is very, very, utterly and crazy meticulous. He\u2019s like the music\u2026 the amount of energy and time we use to dig into the details; he\u2019s the same on the lights. We love him. I\u2019ve known Saxon since I was five years old; I played soccer with him, so it\u2019s just really rad that we\u2019ve been doing this together. From our FOH engineer, Ryan, to Saxton, we\u2019re definitely a team that works together to make it the best we can for everyone else.\n\nSR: Who is your personal, biggest musical inspiration in your life?\n\nZV: My biggest musical inspiration in my life has to be my parents. They weren\u2019t musicians, but the love and support they gave me to pursue my passion and my dreams at an early age was truly magical and I can\u2019t thank them enough. Thanks Mom and Dad, I love you guys.\n\nJennifer graduated from Georgia State University in 2013 with a BA in journalism and a minor in performing arts.
