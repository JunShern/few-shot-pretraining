Recently, as a result of an item here, I read an article from which a single line has stuck.  It wasn't the most profound, it wasn't the most amusing, it wasn't even necessarily the most valuable, but it's one that has immediately made me think differently, and will be with me a long time.<p>I'd like to create a collection of such things.  I'm pretty sure things that affect you guys will be of varying value, but if we make a list and then let them float up and down as they get modded, maybe we'll get something interesting.<p>Replies are discouraged.  These will not be universal truths, they will not be unarguable, but I suggest that this is not the place.  Perhaps if you <i>really</i> disagree you can blog about it and submit a link.  But perhaps not here - perhaps as a main item.<p>Worth a try?  Who will play along?  I'll start ...\n======\nRiderOfGiraffes\nYou can't make your program run faster, you can only make it do less.\n\n------\nanamax\nAlmost any problem can be solved by adding a level of indirection. Almost\nevery program can be sped up by removing a level of indirection.\n\n------\nreddiar\nThe hardest bugs are those where your mental model of the situation is just\nwrong, so you can't see the problem at all : B.

In that order.\n\n------\nanamax\nAll programming is an exercise in caching.\n\n"
