This list is not\nexhaustive; many more mystics have announced the Three Days of Darkness.\n\nFollowing are some natural and supernatural remedies to use\nagainst the calamities, that are menacing the world as revealed to Marie-Julie\nby our Lord and the Blessed Virgin.\n\n1. THREE DAYS OF DARKNESS: Only BLESSED WAX CANDLES will give light. One such candle will\nsuffice for each household during the three days of darkness. They will not give\nlight in the homes of the impious and blasphemers.\n\n2. FATAL PLAGUES: The\none and only remedy to protect oneself is to swallow a piece of very\nthin paper (cigarette-paper) on which will be written: \"O,\nJesu Christe, Victor Mortis, Salva Nos, O, Crux, Ave, Spes Unica.\" \"O,\nJesus, Conqueror of Death, Save us, O, Cross, our only Hope, We greet\nYou.\"\n\n3. FOR ANIMALS: One must put around\ntheir necks a St. Benedict medal. Our Lady warned all\npeople to wear a St. Benedict medal.\n\n4. DURING THE PERIOD OF THE GREAT CALAMITIES:(Earthquakes, wars,\nfloods. etc.) : Recite the\nfollowing prayer to the Holy Cross: \"I hail thee, I adore\nthee, I embrace thee, O, Adorable Cross of my Saviour, protect us, keep\nus, save us, Jesus loved thee so much, by His example I love thee. By\nthy holy image calm my fears, I only feel peace and confidence.\"\n\n6. WARS AND REVOLUTIONS: (Our\nLord revealed\nduring an ecstacy): To dispel all fear\nand terror, you will touch your forehead with a holy picture or a medal\nof Mary Immaculate [the Miraculous Medal]. Your spirit will\nremain calm. Your heart will not\nfear the approach of the terror of men. Your spirit will not\nexperience the effects of My Great Justice.\n\n7. UNKNOWN DISEASES (Given during an ecstacy) : A medal of My\nDivine Heart, and a medal upon which is traced the Adorable Cross. You will steep into a\nglass of water the two images, be it made of cardboard or metal. You will drink this\nwater that is twice blessed and twice purified. One drop only in your\nfood, one little drop, will suffice to drive away not the scourge, but the\nscourges of My justice. (The Miraculous Medal\nalone, fulfills the conditions required). You will give a drop\nof this water to the poor souls touched by the scourge of unknown diseases,\nthose which attack the heart, the spirit, the word.\n\n8. DIVERSE ILLNESSES: \u201cYou\nwill take an infusion of St. John's Wort especially during crisis,\nsufferings of the chest and violent headaches. Hawthorn for cholera.\nFor unknown fevers, the humble violet, the perfume of virtue of humility\nwill have effect.\"\n\n9. EPIDEMICS or EPIZO\u00d6TICS: [epizootiology is the science dealing with the character, ecology, and causes of animal diseases. ed.cj]The Lord gives to\nthe great ST. BENEDICT [PATRON SAINT OF EUROPE! ed.cj] the power to alleviate this great calamity. A respectful\nprocession of the statue, made without any fear or dread, may arrest this\ncalamity.\n\n10. EARTHLY AND CELESTIAL FIRE: The Sacred Heart of\nJesus: The heat will be\nterrible ... a sign of the Cross made with holy water will diminish the heat\nand drive away the sparks. You will kiss five\ntimes small indulgenced crosses ... small crosses applied to the five wounds of\nJesus Crucified on a holy image. From such protection\nmay benefit souls, poor sinners, invoking My Immaculate Mother, Mother of\nSalvation, Refuge and Reconciliation of sinners.\n\n11. OBJECTS OF PROTECTION: The Holy Virgin: \"Always have\nready and at hand your objects of protection: your blessed wax candles, your\nmedals, your pictures and holy objects from which flow all blessings.\" The Holy Virgin\nsays: \"My little\nchildren, it is faith, it is confidence, the most beautiful of all prayer which\nobtains the most.\"\n\n12. PLACES OF REFUGE: Revelation of the\nDivine Heart of Jesus to Marie-Julie: \"My loved\nones, there are three places of refuge (for the time of tribulations): My\nDivine Heart, My Divine Cross, and My Beloved Immaculate Mother.\" St. Anne said the\nsame things to Marie-Julie: \"You have\nseveral places of refuge at the moment of chastisement: that of the Cross, the\nAdorable Divine Heart, and the Virginal Heart of my Immaculate Daughter.\"13. THE MODE OF USING THE HAWTHORN AS GIVEN BY OUR BLESSED MOTHER:\"There\nwill be a grave illness which human science will not be able to\nalleviate. This illness will attack firstly the heart, then the spirit,\nand at the same time, the tongue. It will be horrible. The heat\naccompanying it will be a devouring fire insupportable and so intense\nthat the members of the body affected will be red -- an unendurable\nfiery red. At the end of seven days this disease, sown like a seed in\nthe field (incubation period) will spread everywhere rapidly and make\ngreat progress.\" \"My children, here is the ONLY remedy which could save\nyou. You are familiar with the Hawthorn which grows practically in all\nhedges. The leaves of the Hawthorn, not the wood, can arrest the\nprogress of this disease.\" \"You will gather the leaves, not the wood.\nEven dry, they will keep their efficacy. You will put them into boiling\nwater and leave them there for 14 minutes, covering the receptacle so\nthat the steam remains therein. At the onset of this disease, one must\nuse this remedy three times a day.\" \"This disease will produce a\ncontinual vomiting and nausea. If the remedy is taken too late, the\npart of the body affected will become black and in the black there will\nbe seen a sort of pale, yellow streak.\"\n\nINFORMATION FROM WIKIPEDIA ABOUT SOME REMEDIES MARIE-JULIE JAHENNY RECOMMENDED:\n\nST JOHN'S WORT, HYPERICUM PERFORATUM, IS NOT THE SAME PLANT AS GROUND-IVY, GLECHOMA HEDERACEA\n\nHowever,they are both medicinal plants. So that no one will make the mistake of equating the two, I'm giving the Wikipedia description of both.\n\nGROUND-IVY\n\nGround-Ivy \"Glechoma hederacea (syn. Nepeta glechoma Benth., Nepeta hederacea (L.) Trevir.) is an aromatic, perennial, evergreencreeper of the mint family Lamiaceae.\nIt is commonly known as Ground-ivy, gill-over-the-ground or Creeping\nCharlie. It has numerous medicinal uses, and is commonly used as a salad\ngreen in many countries. European settlers carried it around the world,\nand it has become a well established naturalized/introduced plant in a\nwide variety of localities.\n\nGROUND-IVY\n\nGlechoma hederacea\n\n\"Glechoma hederacea is native to\nEurope and southwestern Asia but has been introduced to North America\nand is now common in most regions other than the Rocky Mountains ...\n\n\"Glechoma is sometimes confused with common mallow or Malva neglecta,\nwhich also has round, lobed leaves; but mallow leaves are attached to\nthe stem at the back of a rounded leaf, where ground ivy has square\nstems and leaves which are attached in the center of the leaf, more\nprominent rounded lobes on their edges, attach to the stems in an\nopposite arrangement, and have a hairy upper surface. In addition,\nmallow and other creeping plants sometimes confused with ground ivy do\nnot spread from nodes on stems. In addition, ground ivy emits a\ndistinctive odor when damaged, being a member of the mint family.\n\n\ufeff\n\nGROUND-IVY\n\nGlechoma hederacea\n\n\"The flowers of Glechoma are\nbilaterally symmetrical, funnel shaped, blue or bluish-violet to\nlavender, and grow in opposed clusters of 2 or 3 flowers in the leaf axils on the upper part of the stem or near the tip. It usually flowers in the spring ...\n\n\"Glechoma is quite attractive. It is grown as a potted plant and occasionally as a ground cover. Easily cultivated, it grows well in shaded places. A variegated\nvariety is commercially available; in many areas this is the dominant\nform which has escaped cultivation and become established as an\naggressive, adventitious ground cover.\n\n\"While often thought of as a weed because of its propensity for spreading, Glechoma\nhas culinary and medicinal uses which were the cause of its being\nimported to America by early European settlers. The fresh herb can be\nrinsed and steeped in hot water to create an herbal tea which is rich in vitamin C.\nIt has a distinctive, mildly peppery flavor; it can be cooked as a pot\nherb, although it is most commonly eaten as a fresh salad green.Glechoma was also widely used by the Saxons in brewingbeer as flavoring, clarification, and preservative, before the introduction of hops for these purposes; thus the brewing-related names, Alehoof, Tunhoof, and Gill-over-the-ground ...\n\n\"Glechoma has been used in the cheese-making process as a substitute for animal rennet ...\n\n\"SAFETY Although it has been used as a salad green and in herbal medicines for thousands of years, the safety of Glechoma hederacea has not been established scientifically, and THERE IS SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO WARRANT CAUTION WITH ITS USE.Glechoma hederacea is toxic to cattle and horses. It is known to contain terpenoids; terpene-rich volatile oils are known to irritate the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys. The volatile oil also contains pulegone, a chemical also occurring in pennyroyal that is a known irritant, toxic to the liver, and ALSO AN ABORTIFACIENT. The total yield of volatile oil in Glechoma is less than 1/30th the concentration that of pennyroyal ...\"\n\nST JOHN'S WORT\n\n\"St John's wort is the plantspeciesHypericum perforatum, and is also known as Tipton's weed, rosin rose, goatweed, chase-devil, or Klamath weed. With qualifiers, St John's wort is used to refer to any species of the genus Hypericum. Therefore, H. perforatum is sometimes called common St John's wort or perforate St John's wort to differentiate it. The species of Hypericum are classified in the Hypericaceae family, having previously been classified as Guttiferae or Clusiaceae. Approximately 370 species of the genus Hypericum exist worldwide with a native geographical distribution including temperate and subtropical regions of North America, Europe, Turkey, Ukraine, Russia, India, China and Brazil. St John's wort is widely known as an herbal medicine for treating depression...\n\n\"Hypericum perforatum is a yellow-flowering, stoloniferous or sarmentose,perennialherb indigenous to Europe,\nwhich has been introduced to many temperate areas of the world and\ngrows wild in many meadows. The common name comes from its traditional\nflowering and harvesting on St John's day, 24 June. The genus name Hypericum is derived from the Greek words hyper (above) and eikon\n(picture), in reference to the traditional use of the plant to ward off\nevil, by hanging plants over a religious icon in the house during St\nJohn's day. The species name perforatum\nrefers to the presence of small oil glands in the leaves that look like\nwindows, which can be seen when they are held against the light... \ufeff\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\n\n\"St John's wort is a perennial plant with extensive, creeping rhizomes.\nIts stems are erect, branched in the upper section, and can grow to 1 m\nhigh. It has opposing, stalkless, narrow, oblong leaves that are 12 mm\nlong or slightly larger. The leaves are yellow-green in color, with\ntransparent dots throughout the tissue and occasionally with a few black\ndots on the lower surface. Leaves exhibit obvious translucent dots when\nheld up to the light, giving them a \u2018perforated\u2019 appearance, hence the\nplant's Latin name...\n\nST JOHN'S WORT\n\nHypericum perforatum\n\n\ufeff\n\nST JOHN'S WORT\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\n\nHypericum perforatum\n\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\"Its\nflowers measure up to 2.5 cm across, have five petals, and are colored\nbright yellow with conspicuous black dots. The flowers appear in broad cymes at the ends of the upper branches, between late spring and early to mid summer. The sepals are pointed, with glandular dots in the tissue. There are many stamens, which are united at the base into three bundles. The pollen grains are ellipsoidal.When flower buds (not the flowers themselves) or seed pods are crushed, a reddish/purple liquid is produced...\n\nMEDICINAL USES \"St John's Wort is widely known as an herbal treatment for depression. In some countries, such as Germany,\nit is commonly prescribed for mild depression, especially in children\nand adolescents. It is proposed that the mechanism of action of St.\nJohn's wort is due to the inhibition of reuptake of certain\nneurotransmitters...\"\n\nTRADCATKNIGHT VIDEOS!\n\nTCK Youtube Channel\n\nTRADCATKNIGHT- TOP 3 CATHOLIC YOUTUBE CHANNEL\n\nArchbishop Lefebvre\n\n\u201cThis Second Vatican Council Reform, since it has issued from Liberalism and from Modernism, is entirely corrupt; it comes from heresy and results in heresy, even if all its acts are not formally heretical. It is thus impossible for any faithful Catholic who is aware of these things to adopt this Reform, or to submit to it in any way at all. To ensure our salvation, the only attitude of fidelity to the Church and to Catholic doctrine, is a categorical refusal to accept the Reform.\u201d\n\nANNOUNCEMENTS\n\nArchbishop Lefebvre\n\n\u201cAnd we have the precise conviction that this new rite of Mass expresses a new faith, a faith which is not ours, a faith which is not the Catholic Faith. This New Mass is a symbol, is an expression, is an image of a new faith, of a Modernist faith. \u2026.Now it is evident that the new rite, if I may say so, supposes another conception of the Catholic religion-another religion.\u201d\n\nFOLLOW TRADCATKNIGHT ON TUMBLR!\n\nTCK Facebook\n\nFOLLOW TRADCATKNIGHT ON PINTEREST\n\nArchbishop Lefebvre\n\nThat Conciliar Church is a schismatic Church, because it breaks with the Catholic Church that has always been. It has its new dogmas, its new priesthood, its new institutions, its new worship, all already condemned by the Church in many a document, official and definitive.... The Church that affirms such errors is at once schismatic and heretical. This Conciliar Church is, therefore, not Catholic. To whatever extent Pope, Bishops, priests, or faithful adhere to this new Church, they separate themselves from the Catholic Church...\n\nFr.

We do not accept this new religion. We are of the religion of all time; we are of the Catholic religion. We are not of this 'universal religion' as they call it today-this is not the Catholic religion any more. We are not of this Liberal, Modernist religion which has its own worship, its own priests, its own faith, its own catechisms, its own Bible, the 'ecumenical Bible'-these things we do not accept.\"\n\nTraditional Quotes & Prayers\n\nThe Real 3rd Secret of Fatima\n\nInlcudes Vatican II and the soon Apostate Church...\"...because Fatima is a very apocalyptic message.

This persistence of Mary about the dangers which menace the Church is a divine warning against the suicide of altering the Faith, in Her liturgy, Her theology and Her soul. \u2026 I hear all around me innovators who wish to dismantle the Sacred Chapel, destroy the universal flame of the Church, reject Her ornaments and make Her feel remorse for Her historical past.\"A day will come when the civilized world will deny its God, when the Church will doubt as Peter doubted. She will be tempted to believe that man has become God. In our churches, Christians will search in vain for the red lamp where God awaits them. Like Mary Magdalene, weeping before the empty tomb, they will ask, 'Where have they taken Him?'\"\n\nALEXA RANK\n\nFind The Rank Of Any Website\n\nCurrent Crusaders Online Worldwide (RealTime)\n\nSt. Bernard:\n\nGo forth confidently then, you knights, and repel the foes of the cross of Christ with a stalwart heart. Know that neither death nor life can separate you from the love of God which is in Jesus Christ, and in every peril repeat, \"Whether we live or whether we die, we are the Lord's.\" What a glory to return in victory from such a battle! How blessed to die there as a martyr! Rejoice, brave athlete, if you live and conquer in the Lord; but glory and exult even more if you die and join your Lord. Life indeed is a fruitful thing and victory is glorious, but a holy death is more important than either. If they are blessed who die in the Lord, how much more are they who die for the Lord!\n\nHow secure, I say, is life when death is anticipated without fear; or rather when it is desired with feeling and embraced with reverence! How holy and secure this knighthood and how entirely free of the double risk run by those men who fight not for Christ! Whenever you go forth, O worldly warrior, you must fear lest the bodily death of your foe should mean your own spiritual death, or lest perhaps your body and soul together should be slain by him.\n\nIndeed, danger or victory for a Christian depends on the dispositions of his heart and not on the fortunes of war. If he fights for a good reason, the issue of his fight can never be evil; and likewise the results can never be considered good if the reason were evil and the intentions perverse. If you happen to be killed while you are seeking only to kill another, you die a murderer. If you succeed, and by your will to overcome and to conquer you perchance kill a man, you live a murderer. Now it will not do to be a murderer, living or dead, victorious or vanquished. What an unhappy victory--to have conquered a man while yielding to vice, and to indulge in an empty glory at his fall when wrath and pride have gotten the better of you!\n\nBut what of those who kill neither in the heat of revenge nor in the swelling of pride, but simply in order to save themselves? Even this sort of victory I would not call good, since bodily death is really a lesser evil than spiritual death. The soul need not die when the body does. No, it is the soul which sins that shall die.\n\nThe knight of Christ, I say, may strike with confidence and die yet more confidently, for he serves Christ when he strikes, and serves himself when he falls. Neither does he bear the sword in vain, for he is God's minister, for the punishment of evildoers and for the praise of the good. If he kills an evildoer, he is not a mankiller, but, if I may so put it, a killer of evil. He is evidently the avenger of Christ towards evildoers and he is rightly considered a defender of Christians. Should he be killed himself, we know that he has not perished, but has come safely into port.\n\nOnce he finds himself in the thick of battle, this knight sets aside his previous gentleness, as if to say, \"Do I not hate those who hate you, O Lord; am I not disgusted with your enemies?\" These men at once fall violently upon the foe, regarding them as so many sheep. No matter how outnumbered they are, they never regard these as fierce barbarians or as awe-inspiring hordes. Nor do they presume on their own strength, but trust in the Lord of armies to grant them the victory.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nSaint Athanasius\n\n\"May God console you! ... What saddens you ... is the fact that others have occupied the churches by violence, while during this time you are on the outside. It is a fact that they have the premises \u2013 but you have the Apostolic Faith. They can occupy our churches, but they are outside the true Faith. You remain outside the places of worship, but the Faith dwells within you. Let us consider: what is more important, the place or the Faith?The true Faith, obviously. Who has lost and who has won in the struggle \u2013 the one who keeps the premises or the one who keeps the Faith? True, the premises are good when the Apostolic Faith is preached there; they are holy if everything takes place there in a holy way ...\"You are the ones who are happy; you who remain within the Church by your Faith, who hold firmly to the foundations of the Faith which has come down to you from Apostolic Tradition. And if an execrable jealousy has tried to shake it on a number of occasions, it has not succeeded. They are the ones who have broken away from it in the present crisis. No one, ever, will prevail against your Faith, beloved Brothers. And we believe that God will give us our churches back some day. \"Thus, the more violently they try to occupy the places of worship, the more they separate themselves from the Church. They claim that they represent the Church; but in reality, they are the ones who are expelling themselves from it and going astray. Even if Catholics faithful to Tradition are reduced to a handful, they are the ones who are the true Church of Jesus Christ.\""
