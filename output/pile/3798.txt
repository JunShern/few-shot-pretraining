More than one datacenter equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking, which is called the Availability Zone.\n\n\n\n\n\nAvailability Zones are the combination of the data-center where data -centers are equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking, which protects your applications from datacenter failure.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy needed Availability Zones in Microsoft Azure.\n\n\n\n\n\n1- If you select any region to set up your environment to ensure resiliency, Azure provides three separates zones in all enables regions.\n\n\n\n\n\n2- The physical separation of Availability Zones within a region protects applications and data from datacenter failure.\n\n\n\n\n\n3- Zone-redundant services replicate your applications and data across Availability Zones to protect from single-points-of-failure.\n\n\n\n\n\n4- With Availability Zones, Azure offers industry best 99.99% VM uptime SLA.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn Availability Zone in an Azure region is a combination of a fault domain and an update domain. For example, if you create three or more VMs across three zones in an Azure region, your VMs are effectively distributed across three fault domains and three update domains. The Azure platform recognizes this distribution across update domains to make sure that VMs in different zones are not updated at the same time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegions that support Availability Zones\n\n\n\n\n\n1.
