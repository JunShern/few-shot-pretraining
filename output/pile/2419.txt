(Thailand),\nEach person who steps foot on that sacred ground will be FOREVER CHANGED.\n- Michael (Atlanta, GA),\n\nVenue Highlights\n\nThe Rainforest Healing Center is based on a parcel of land (160 acres / 65 hectares) of pristine, virgin Amazonian rainforest on Kilometer 45.5 of the Iquitos/Nauta Carretera (highway).\nThis rainforest backdrop breathes life and healing energy into every soul who enters this sacred space. One can receive healing benefits just from being in this part of the rainforest as it is saturated with over 110 documented species of healing medicinal plants including the Mother Vine herself.\n\nAlong our varied paths, guests are immersed in a tropical Eden where they can witness numerous varieties of sparkling butterflies including our resident colony of Blue Morphos, chattering monkeys, curious sloths, and various other jungle life. The hum and vibration of the forest is felt throughout the space, welcoming you back to nature\u2019s incredible beauty and grace.\n\nThroughout the property runs a stream (called a \u2018quebrada\u2019 in Spanish) that also boasts potent healing powers. Rain trickles down from the upper canopy of the forest, passing through many more layers of dense jungle growth, collecting its healing properties from all the medicinal plants on its way to the vegetation and roots below. Forest soils filter this frequent rainfall into the crisp and clean \u2018quebrada\u2019 that meanders through the center. Our guests bathe in this healing flow and receive love from each plant that the rain has touched on its journey to the stream.\n\nAs a small and intimate healing center, we\u2019ve designed the property to create the optimal environment for self-reflection, introspection, growth, healing, and deep awakening. We deeply honor our connection with Mother Earth and therefore utilize renewable resources whenever possible. We are powered almost entirely by solar energy, compost, and Love, far away from the distractions of Western culture and technology.\n\nAyahuasca ceremonies will be held in the Maloca (ceremonial hut), which was constructed by a master carpenter and architect from Pucallpa and is a powerful and beautiful space.\n\nAccommodations\n\nYour retreat investment covers room and board. We\u2019ve built seven Tambos (mosquito-screened, palm frond or corrugated metal roof huts) on the property. Five of the Tambos sleep two people, with the other two sleeping three. Tambos are furnished with writing desks for reflection and hammocks for relaxing when space allows.\n\nEach of our Tambos is hand-crafted with love in carefully selected locations to provide a quiet and cozy place for guests to relax and reconnect with themselves and nature. The jungle radiates through these beautiful Tambos, and creates a unique and unforgettable experience. Each Tambo offers solar power for lighting, its own bathing area, and compostable toilets to cycle nutrients back into the land.\n\nWhile they are rustic, we\u2019ve designed them to be very comfortable and enjoyable. It\u2019s important to understand that you will be sleeping in the jungle and life\u2019s wild hums and vibrations will be ever-present. In time, you\u2019ll find the jungle sounds to be a living white noise machine that will help you fall asleep.\n\nAmenities\n\nKitchen\n\nHot Tub\n\nCoffee/Tea\n\nHouse Keeping\n\nMenu Types\n\nVegan\n\nVegetarian\n\nPescetarian\n\nMeat\n\nOrganic\n\nGluten Free\n\nDairy Free\n\nMenu/Cuisine\n\nGuests will enjoy three healthy and balanced meals a day. On ceremony days, guests participating in the ceremony will have breakfast and lunch, but no dinner. This restriction helps ensure that your stomach is empty by the time ceremony participants drink the Medicine. This allows your body to absorb the Medicine fully and efficiently, and also reduce the amount of materials thrown up if your purging includes vomiting.\n\nMaster Plant Isolation Diets will be on a stricter, blander meal schedule that is prepared and brought to your Tambo to reduce interactions with other people.\n\nWe DO NOT serve pork, salt, coffee, or sugar. We strive to feed everyone according to their needs and we don\u2019t want anyone hungry or frustrated. We do request that you adhere to this diet; it greatly improves Ayahuasca\u2019s ability to work effectively and efficiently during ceremony.\n\nDirections\n\nThe traditional route is to fly into Lima, and then take a domestic Peruvian flight on either Star Peru or Peruvian Airlines to Iquitos.\nYou\u2019ll want to plan to stay at least one night before your retreat or course start date. The Amazon is a very different place and takes a little adjustment. Having the time to relax, clean up, and get prepared for your journey is a great pleasure. Plus, you can visit one of the many wonderful cafes with WiFi to let your family know that you\u2019re alive and well!\n\nOur staff will meet you in Iquitos at a pre-determined location (typically Dawn on the Amazon or Chef Paz), date, and time. From there, we\u2019ll take you to Rainforest Healing Center, which is located one hour\u2019s drive from Iquitos on the highway Iquitos\u2014Nauta. From the highway the walk is ~3.5km (approx. 40-mins to 1-hour) through some amazing jungle on a wide and friendly path. If it has rained you will need rubber boots since the path can get quite muddy. You can buy these in Iquitos at the Belen market for roughly 20 soles, or purchase them online prior to your trip. We also encourage people to leave their boots after their stay for use by families in need.\n\nPlease use bags that can be carried on the shoulders of our workers, e.g back packs, shoulder bags (no suitcases). If you are unable to walk this distance due to medical reasons please inform our staff in advance so that other arrangements can be made.\n\nAbout the\nVenue and Teacher\n\nWelcome to Rainforest Healing Center! We are an Ayahuasca and Master Plant diet retreat center, specializing in the individualized care and small group retreats, located in the heart of the Peruvian Amazon. What Makes Our Center Different -- Personalized Healing ProgramsAt Rainforest Healing Center, we offer the opportunity to transform your physical, mental, emotional and spiritual lives through healing. A crucial part of healing lies in the facilitation process. While our shamans guide the energies of the ceremonies, purify your physical and energetic bodies, expand your consciousness and guide your spiritual growth, our facilitators work to guide and support you throughout this transformative process. During your stay with us, our experienced and qualified facilitators function as bridges between you, the shamans and the plants to guide and support you in your journey of transformative healing. Our services are tailored to your individual needs and personalized to the types of healing you are seeking. Our facilitators and shamans will work with you through one-on-one sessions to best meet your personal needs.On your first day, our facilitators will have a one-on-one session with you about what you came to heal. You will then sit down with our shamans who will prescribe additional remedies such as floral baths, plant baths, and remedial massages to prepare you for a ceremony, correct physical misalignments as well as align your energies.On ceremony days, you will have one-on-one intention setting sessions with our facilitators to help you focus your intention. Our Facilitators are trained to guide and challenge you to seek the innermost truths of your being and to uncover the layers of familial, cultural and societal conditioning to access the deepest core of your being.On the days after ceremonies, the facilitators will have one-on-one processing sessions with you to help you make sense of the powerful physical, mental, emotional, spiritual and visual experiences you have had during your ayahuasca experience, to make connections and to relate what the medicine has shown you to the healing you are undertaking.We pride ourselves on the amount of time, energy and care we devote to each guest to that we can successfully fill our mission of healing our planet, one cosmic brother and sister at a time.This rainforest backdrop breathes life and healing energy into every soul who enters this sacred space. One can receive healing benefits just from being in this part of the rainforest as it is home to over 110+ documented species of healing medicinal plants. Along our varied paths, guests are immersed in a tropical Eden where they can witness several colonies of sparkling butterflies, chattering monkeys, curious sloths, and other jungle animals. The hum and vibration of the forest are felt throughout the space, welcoming you to slow down and relax into nature\u2019s incredible beauty and grace.The property has a stream or \u2018quebrada\u2019 as known in Spanish, that has potent healing powers as well. Rain trickles down from the upper canopy of the forest, passing through many more layers of dense jungle growth, collecting its healing properties from all the medicinal plants as it reaches the vegetation and roots below. Forest soils filter this almost daily rainfall into the crisp and clean \u2018quebrada\u2019 that meanders through the center. Our guests bathe in this healing flow and receive love from each plant that the rain has touched when they enjoy their bucket showers.Since we are a small private boutique medicinal plant healing retreat center, we\u2019ve designed the property to create an optimal environment for self-reflection, introspection, growth, healing, and awakening on a very deep level. Each of our Tambos (jungle bungalows) were handcrafted, built, and located with love to provide a quiet yet cozy place for guests to relax and \u2018tap back into\u2019 their true essence (nature). The jungle radiates through these beautiful Tambos, and creates a unique and unforgettable experience.We deeply honor our connection with the land that we call home and therefore utilize renewable resources whenever possible. We run completely on solar, compost, and love, far away from the distractions of Western culture and technology. We do our best to farm as much vegetation and protein as we possibly can directly from the land and include them in our \u2018dietas\u2019 (ceremonial diets for purification and healing). Each Tambo includes solar power, very comfortable bedding, a showering area, and a compostable restroom to cycle nutrients back into the farm.Through our retreats, we guide guests in aiding their own healing process with one-on-one individualized care. By cleansing and detoxifying the physical body, releasing emotional blockages and toxins, the Ayahuasca and Master Plants of the rainforest help the individual achieve deep realizations and higher states of consciousness. This process can sometimes be challenging, so our experienced shaman and facilitators have the deepest compassion, patience, and love to support our guests while healing. We understand that in healing oneself we are also healing, raising the vibration of, and reuniting humankind. So, we are eternally grateful to you for doing your part of the work!\u201cThere is no EPIDURAL for SPIRITUAL BIRTH.\u201d \u2013 Linda V. (Australia)Our vision for Rainforest Healing Center is guided by our intention to help others access the healing and tremendous gifts that each of us here at Rainforest Healing Center have received through our work with Ayahuasca and the Master Plants of the jungle. Our goal is a simple one: we want to honor those gifts by making these medicines available, in a safe and intimate way, to others. What sets us apart from other centers is the private and boutique approach we have taken. We screen applicants carefully and only allow up to 10 guests per retreat. We provide private (single or shared) occupancy Tambos to allow guests to receive an intimate yet comfortable stay whether they are on an Ayahuasca retreat or Master Plant Isolation Diet.\n\nESTEBAN SHANEN MESTA\nEsteban started walking with a sacred medicine with this grandfather, Olivero Garcia Shanen who was a respected healer in his community. With his grandfather, Esteban learned with sacred rituals of ayahuasca. At 17, he was initiated to conduct ceremonies jointly with his grandfather. At 24, his grandfather died and Esteban became the official \u2018curandero\u2019 or healer of his community\nEsteban has done various rigorous Master Plant Diets; Chiric Sanango, Bobinsana, Huayruro, Kamalanga, Uchu Sanango, Chuchuhuasi, Remo Caspi, Ayahuma, Ajo Sacha, Huara Caspi, Pinion Colorado, and the legendary master tree Nihue Rao.\nOLINDA NETE AVE\nOlinda was introduced into the world of medicinal plants at a very early age, due to the fact that her mother was the \u2018curandera\u2019 healer of their community. Olinda has vast memories of people seeking her mother to cure ailments ranging from snake bites to cancer. When Olinda turned 16 years old her mother instead that she would need to pass all the information from their lineage so that Olindo would be able to continue to heal the family and the community. When Olinda was 35 years old, her mother passed away.\nShe decided to continue the family tradition and to do that she started to do some intense Master Plant Diets; Chiric Sanango, Bobinsana, Pinion Negro, Ajo Sacha, Chullachaqui Caspi, Remo Caspi, Palo Sangre, Punga, Capriona, Tortuga.\n\nReviews\nTo review this event, visit the page for the venue or retreat leaders (above).\n\nIn light of the very recent suicide that took place at this center by one of their staff members, I would like to warn any would-be guests about attending here.\nI used to work at this center a few years ago (I also attended for nearly 3 weeks as a guest). The owner displays many, MANY traits of a sociopath. He emotionally abused his staff (as well as engaging in sex with several of them). The work environment was degrading in so many ways with hardly any time for adequate sleep or self-care, but we all loved the jungle and the medicine which kept us tethered there despite the obvious abuse. I encourage more people to come forward with what they saw because I know there are a lot of other people who witnessed the darkness there.\nWhy am I only now coming forward? Because I just found out that a facilitator at RHC has recently stabbed himself to death there and I can\u2019t keep quiet anymore. I will probably be personally attacked for this comment, and I am shaking as I write this\u2026 but sometimes you have to speak out, no matter how hard it is. Wishing peace to this soul and his family\u2026\nIf you would like confirmation about what I have written here and additional infomation, please check out the center\u2019s facebook page and read the comments on my review.\n\nSTAY AWAY. This center just had a death. And it's absolutely heartbreaking that the death was a facillitator who committed suicide DURING a ceremony. There are numerous stories coming out now on facebook now and already floating around in the ayahuasca community about the owner, Omar Gomez (an alias by the way. His real name is William Feldman), and his emotional and sexual abuse of staff and guests. I myself was briefly a staff member before I left in disgust.\nHe reaches out to female guests after retreats and tries to lure them to his home for visits and has tragically slept with many of them. This is taking advantage of women still under the influence of ayahuasca.\nThat a facillitator committed suicide during a ceremony speaks volumes as to the lack of safety, screening and competence happening at Rainforest Healing Center. I feel so much compassion and grief for that poor young man's family. What happened to him was in no way his fault.\n\nI had thought about Ayahuasca for years, I know one of the founders of RHC so when I felt it was my time, there was no question on where I would go. I had no idea how lucky I was! I\u2019ve heard horror stories of bad experiences at other retreats and I can only imagine how hard it must be to make a decision based on online reviews and pictures! All I can say is that this is your place! You can stop looking! There are so many wonderful things to say but overall the feeling of love and instant family is what was so surprising to me. I felt safe and cared for in every way. I was given so much individual attention but also time and space to myself to reflect and process. The facilitators Freddy & Nelson genuinely love and support you every step of the way! They listen, offer advice and are extremely knowledgeable and intuitive. They suggest books to read and help you with your intention for ceremonies. I don\u2019t think I could\u2019ve done this without them???????? Kristina is the on-site manager but she is so much more than that! She also offers Kambo and is extremely knowledgeable with that process. She just brings a sweetness to the place:)\nThen there are the Shaman\u2026 If you ever considered working with Ayahuasca without a shaman please reconsider! Being in the jungle and having the shaman guide you and sing to you during the ceremonies was such a huge part of my experience and journey! They know what they\u2019re doing, they communicate with the spirit and work on every person individually. They work so incredibly hard and are so sweet, happy, gentle and kind. They hug you like you are family and tell you they love you and you feel it. These are not things that can be simulated or faked. This boutique center has a maximum of 8 people to give the best care and attention to everyone. The facilities are somewhat rustic (you are in the jungle) but extremely comfortable and private. It felt rather luxurious compared to what I was expecting \u263a\ufe0f\nThis is by far the best gift I have ever given myself! I only went for 7 days but I\u2019m already trying to plan my next visit. I made huge progress in just 3 ceremonies but I can\u2019t wait to dive in deeper and learn more!\nP.S. the food was delicious!????\n\nI spent a week at the Rainforest Healing Centre, and did three ayahuasca ceremonies. I was quite sceptical before I arrived, but by the time I left, I was in love with the place, and the wonderful staff who work there.\u2800\nThe food, the accommodation, the jungle scenery, the shamans and the support and help given by the facilitators was all top notch. Ten out of ten from me!\n\nI just finished a week retreat at Rainforest Healing Centre in Iquitos, and it was the most amazing, profound, magical, enlightening, emotional, liberating, loving, connecting, intense, relieving, healing, learning, experience of my life.\nThe shamans, Esteban & Linda, are two lovely elders, a husband and wife couple, from the Shipibo tradition (originally from Pucallpa). They both have open and loving energies, and spend time with each individual person in each ceremony to help them through their journey and emotions, while singing Icaros to them personally, and using their hands to heal and massage if there is a need. They both also sing different Icaros simultaneously throughout the entire ceremony, which sounds magical. I feel extremely lucky to have had the chance to experience their ceremonies, and I now understand how important the shamans are for the process, and the human need for spirituality and connectedness (I was a spiritual skeptic before I came here).\nThe facilitators, Freddie and Nelson, were amazing too, so much love, support, openness, experience, and non-judgment, they do a lot to help and guide you, and create a safe space for everyone. Kristina also does a lot in the background to make sure the centre running smoothly, and brings a lovely energy to the place, and Rhaya was very helpful in the registration process and preparing for the retreat.\nThe centre is surrounded by rainforest, so you really feel in touch with nature while you\u2019re there, which enhances the experience; seeing, smelling, hearing the jungle. You also stay your own personal tambo/hut to chill and process your emotions and thoughts freely and in private, without being surrounded by others, as you can\u2019t see or hear other people from your tambo through the forest, so you can really focus on your own journey.\nThe retreat groups are no more than 8 participants too, so it\u2019s really intimate and you\u2019re not distracted or overwhelmed by many other people\u2019s energies, and you really have time to connect with everyone, including the shamans, facilitators, and other people attending the centre.\nI was able to work through a number of my fears and anxieties while there, and gained a lot of insight and knowledge, but it would have been better to stay longer, three ceremonies feels like you\u2019re just getting into it. I\u2019m already planning my next trip out there for a longer period of time.\nGoing there was the most positive, life changing, and loving thing, I\u2019ve ever done for myself. I got things out of it that I didn\u2019t even know I needed. I would HIGHLY recommend the Rainforest Healing Centre, what a magical place.\n\nStop looking, because you've found the right place...\nIt was an intense and profound experience, in the safest environment possible. The jungle surrounds you with it beauty, while you have the right amount of time by yourself to reflex on your Ayahuasca experiences.\nIts hard to put it all into words....\nJust go and you will feel it is my advise. So much hearth space and love surrounds everything about this place, the facilitators are truly amazing and the Shamans truly magical.\nJust go, I promise you that you will not regret it one second.\n\nThe Rainforest Healing Center is home. I spent a long time in the process of deciding where I wanted to attend my first Ayahuasca retreat but something kept bringing my back to the RHC, I felt its warmth even through the words and pages online. So I took the leap and am infinitely grateful because of it!! My experience is tough to quantify in words but the people at the center and the space they create and hold is magic for such deep healing. I felt safe, guided, cared for, loved and for the week I spent there it became home. I did three ceremonies and each time was able to really dive deep into my intention with the help of the staff who really became such beautiful family! They were catalysts for such growth and self-reflection and to me, were guides pushing me in the right direction back to myself always respecting the gentle nature of the work. It can be an overwhelming process working with medicine like this but never did I feel I didn\u2019t have guidance. I was also empowered to use my own guidance system and felt lovingly shown how to step into my independence. Because of the intimacy of such a small group we too became medicine for each other, family forever. Love and care are poured into everything, the massively nourishing meals, the integration talks, the helpful tips, and the medicine as its being provided. Everything so well thought out from the day to day activity to the sacredness and attention put into the ceremonies that my only focus was put on why I was there. My healing. The space is beautifully built, peaceful, secluded yet wild and free! It flows with the wild of the jungle and creates a natural, harmonious, freeing, heart filed way of being! The accommodations were so comfortable and I was given my own space for reflection, feeling held and secure yet free and independent with my time to my own. The RHC is home, it is a beautiful sacred space for medicine work. I am grateful for all of the staff, the shamans, the love poured into every piece and part of their mission and for their deep respect and honor of the vine and the traditions. I am forever changed by my Ayahuasca experience with this center and cannot wait to return!! I love you guys!!Thank you for guiding in opening my heart and expanding my mind!\n\nI'm sitting down to write this review with a full heart. I have just returned from my first experience with ayahuasca through a 7 day retreat with Rainforest Healing Center and I would like to say a couple things to anyone who is looking to make a decision on where to do the same. Ayahuasca is a powerful medicine that should not be taken lightly and can change your life in many different ways. RHC does the best possible job at respecting this and doing everything in their power to promote healing during your journey. If you're looking to drink ayahuasca, you've found your place.\nThe communication and information given before leaving for the retreat is outstanding. RHC gives you so much support and so many tools to prepare you for the transformation to come. With recommendations for time in Iquitos, suggestions on prices so you don't get ripped off, recommendations for nice hotels, they have you feeling comfortable and confident leaving for Peru. The facilities are as good as you could hope for in the Amazon. Truly amazing spaces for relaxing, reflecting, processing. Someone is always available to talk to. The common area and kitchen is warm and inviting and allows you to relax in times of healing. The attention to needs and care is unmatched.\nThe main thing that stands out about this facility is the love. You create a family when you come to RHC. Everyone of the facilitators makes you feel loved and are there to listen and reflect with you. I don't know what my experience with ayahuasca would have been without these amazing people to lead me through the process. I am so grateful for what these beautiful souls have created and even more grateful for opening it up to those who need it. I would give 100 stars to Rainforest Healing Center if I could. 10/10. Just amazing.\n\nIt has been a few months since I was in the jungle. I wanted to wait to write this to share what has changed for me as a result of this beautiful experience and connection.\nFirstly I felt the Rainforest Healing Centre (RHC) is a sacred, safe space - where all of the workers/healers are protective, loving, respectful and know there stuff. The jungle is breath-taking, wild and free, just being there allowed me the space and time to focus on what is important. At the centre the water and food is clean and fresh, detoxing. The centre feels like home and especially with the dogs and cats and a monkey running around :-)\nI had two ceremonies with the Master Vine. Both times the ceremony space (due to the facilitators and healers), was safe and contained, very reassuring. I also did a Master Plant Diet with Bobinsana, wow! The experience of connecting with these plants and allowing for support and transformation was like nothing I have ever felt. They have allowed me to see different possibilities to situations that were previously thought and felt helpless to change or think differently about. This has been the best gift I have ever received.\nSince being back a situation that dominated my life (in a negative way), has resolved. I believe this is because I was finally able to allow it to, after my experience in the Jungle. I have also resolved a few bad daily habits that were making me unhealthy. Being able to reset in the Jungle helped me to break the cord to these habits just enough to make the change.\nOf course it has not been all smooth sailing and I have gone back and forth with some other bad habits (especially in times of stress). But the lessons from the retreat are not far from my mind. I know that I have something within that I did not have before. So I can keep moving forward and changing what I need to. After the retreat I have also reached out to RHC and received the support I needed which helped me to refocus.\nI would recommend this incredible place to anyone who wants to go. I hope I am lucky enough to go back again. Forever Grateful xx Jasmine.\n\nAfter my 11 day retreat in the Rainforest Hearing Center I have no doubts for plan medicine. I went there scared, angry, confused, tired, exhausted almost giving up on life from all the damage & pain experienced since I have memory. After being sexually assaulted by different family members from my mothers side, Mentally and physically broken by my own father was enough for my whole being to know that this is not how life should be for anyone. I kept everything to my self for 21 years, bubbling, heating up and getting heavier I had to take a quick decision for my self and thats when a really good friend had shared about her experience in this magical place. The energy that surrounds the facility is extremely safe and the employee are truly respectful & helpful. I did 5 ceremonies and 3 of them gave me exactly what i needed physically to get over all the mental damages and traumas. In the first ceremony I was being naive and waiting to feel the medicine after a full cup, but my body was being resistant. Heather nicely told me \u201cyou came here to do to work with the medicine if you do not feel her you need to drink a second time to fully work with her\u201d which helped me for my next ceremony. Being alone became natural when noticing that I am part of everything.\nDuring the days it was super important for me to not be dependent on any company from others as I wanted to be more independent and love my self, enjoy my self for who I am. Ayahuasca helped me find more than I was expecting. She let me understand how staying in the past is throwing your present away and not fully enjoying it to the fullest. The second ceremony was my first glimpse of life as she physically made me feel how she put me apart and fix every part of my heart and body putting me carefully together without hurting. After that night I felt how little by little i was giving me self love by reading, showering more often, writing and not truly thinking of what happen to me in a negative expression. Last and most important letting go of that horrible past that almost end my life in 2014-2015. I was dancing every morning in my tabu and still dance in my home. Feeding my self the right way at the right time and expressing my love for being alive and brave enough to take this journey.\nAnne such a beautiful soul she truly help me understand so much of life. She\u2019s extremely loving and can be rough when you need it { I mean this in the most helpful way. sometimes we need to hear the truth from a different perspective that is not yours} she guide me and basically gave me more therapy using such a beautiful vocabulary where you are able understand and reflect. Heathers energy also helped me in such a different way i felt very comfortable because of her honesty with life experiences. She read my tarot cards and also discussed all my dreams for 11 days!!! I went to RHC for plant medicine and left with a two beautiful friendship that i hope it last forever. The staff was so loving and caring. Olinda and Esteban gave me all the attention that i needed because i was lucky to be in a very small group and had 3 wonderful ceremonies alone. I was grateful for the food and for the creek shower every day where butterflies flew around me constantly making me smile and forgetting about everything.\nComing back to my reality being grateful for everything that has happen and for all the things that lead me to this wonderful center and plant medicine. I love my self more than ever and now I can truly focus in my life and Partner who has been supporting me since day one. Its hard work and I know from the day I left the center my choices have change for the better!\nI had the sweet opportunity to meet and connect with Omar it wasn\u2019t long yet I know our paths will cross again in the near future. He was caring and loving I truly can\u2019t wait to see him again.\nI can truly sit here give you 1000 reason why everyone in their lifetime should visit this facility yet i can\u2019t find not one reason on why should you not. Plant medicine is so powerful and enlightening. Clean and REAL but you will only deserve it when you are truly ready to do the work to accept all your flaws and to become a better person for yourself.\nI feel free, light & Happy with my decision! Still apologizing to my self & my body for all those years i spent hurting.\nThank you Ayahuasca, Rainforest Healing Center and Omar for allowing this place to feel safe for the ones that truly need safety.\nYou will always be part of my heart and journey because of you I can see life for what it is\u2026. BEAUTIFUL\n\nSeriously, your search is over. This place is home; there is simply no other way to put it. This was my first time working with Aya, but I doubt that I will ever work with another centre. Every facet of this place is so incredibly full of love and respect on the highest of levels and this absolutely made my [first] experience with the Vine.\nI can honestly say that my experience with Chakra - the land and all of the people involved here - was just as, if not more so, healing as my experience with the actual plants. I've spent a long time pondering this review largely because I don't feel that human words are an adequate expression of the gratitude that I have for these people and this place. It\u2019s all I can do to resist booking my plane ticket back \u201chome\u201d again, lol.\nFrom the first point of contact, you can tell just how deeply everyone at Chakra cares about your wellbeing on all levels; expect to be thoroughly questioned about all aspects of your health/life to ensure that you are the right fit for this place and in a good space to do this kind of work, if the application wasn't already clear on that! Every member of their team treats you with the most genuine love and respect from day one, even the workers.\nThis is not just a retreat, you become part of a family that just keeps growing. You are being initiated into a very heart-centred way of being. This place is authentic and deep integrity is at the heart of all the work they do which helps you to let go and trust in your experience on a deeper level, which is so incredibly important. Here, you are held every step of the way while also empowered to find/utilize your own power and independence within this work. We had time with our facilitator pre and post-ceremonies to help thoughtfully prepare for and integrate our work - this was so helpful and they\u2019re definitely doing this right. Same thing goes for the small groups; this allows you to connect more intimately with your fellow humans and your experience. These things were SO key.\nEveryone here holds a deep place in my heart - Omar, Viviana, the workers, the fellow retreat participants - and I won't go into details but a special shoutout to Eddy and Cristina....wow. These two really have a special way of bridging the gap between professionalism/guidance and friendship. Feeling like I had friends holding my hand along this journey was so very helpful.\nEven afterwards I had found myself in a tough spot on a few levels and I reached back out to Chakra\u2026let\u2019s just say that they helped me more than I ever could have imagined simply out of the goodness of their hearts - again, especially Cris and Eddy. So much wow.\nI could go on for ages talking about how beyond amazing this place is but instead I\u2019ll finish up with a little blurb on the amazing land and our accommodations. Man, what absolute paradise. It was definitely a trek traveling between our tambos and meals, etc., but the walk really helps you to appreciate the healing beauty of the jungle around you. You\u2019re situated out in the middle of the womb of Mother Earth in all her glory. For being out in the jungle, your home for the retreat is unbelievable luxury and peace. Being in the midst of the beautiful chaos of the forest will lull you to sleep every night.\nLong story, short\u2026 Just jump. You will be supported. Sending all reading this so much love on your journey.\n\nMy experience at the Rainforest Healing Center was profound.\nFirst there is a Connection with the jungle and all the energy and beauty possesses. At the same ntime you also disconnect from the outside world of social media, internet and distraction. This alone is worth the price of admission.\nYou feel like your in another time and place yet there are enough comforts like nice sleeping tambos, private bathing and toilets, clean drinking water, lights ( tambos) and good healthy meals. There is even a bathtub which can be filled with herbs and flowers as you gaze at the stars. It took me a few days to really acclimate to the jungle, especially at night. It\u2019s an otherworldly experience listening to the jungle and it\u2019s night sounds.\nThe Maloca( where ceremonies take place) is a work of art, built by a master Maloca builder. You can feel the spiritual energy and is a perfect conducive place for inner work.\nThe Shamans Olinda and Estaban ( husband &wife) are blessed with inner abilities and are there to watch , heal and diagnose the plant energy\u2019s. Their presence is key to having a good and healing journey.\nThe staff are all there to assist you in making sure you needs are met both on a comfort level as well as an emotional/ spiritual level.\nNow of course it\u2019s the Medicine I came for, but without a set and setting I believe, and many people much wiser than me also agree, is the key to unlocking the wisdom of Mother Aya.\nIf you come with Intention, Love, openness and an Active Imagination you will discover, and heal.\nI highly recommend Rainforest Healing Center as your place to connect.\nPeace and Love to all, Namaste.\n\nIt's been two weeks now, since I left Rainforest Healing Center after an eleven day Ayahuasca retreat.\nMy husband and I also did Ajo Sacha and Kambo. With all my heart I can say this: If you are a novice and are seriously thinking about doing Ayahuasca, then I recommend doing it here. I felt completely secure and taken care of, down to the smallest details. Because the truly important tings for such a serious endeavor are taken care of with such depth and dedication, with LOVE in other words, by everyone at RHC- even the tough moments which are inevitable when one is serious about self healing- became so meaningful and rich.\nJust the place itself, deep inside the jungle felt like such a help. Under the canopy of trees and plants, the sounds and life of everything that surrounds you there are in fact helpers :) I had my own tambo and loved it. I slept like a baby. The bed was very comfortable and the mosquito netting worked perfectly- in fact I didn't get a single bite my whole stay! Almost weird. The compost WC, the bucket baths- ok, I'm Norwegian and used to simple cabin life with no running water and compost wc- but I can honestly say it was a luxury, very peaceful. The food is prepared with the obvious ayahuasca dieta- restrictions in the lovely kitchen/casa, and the cook does a great job. Writing a review of this place is bit strange, because I feel so much love and gratitude towards the whole staff who made it all possible, because this beautiful place truly deserves its name Rainforest H e a l I n g Center. The dedication of the facilitators and shamans was something the whole group, my husband and I most definitely included, were struck by. We had the luck to participate in the harvesting of chacruna leaves; and partake in the whole process of making the ayahuasca brew we used in ceremony, to replanting the Mother Vine the next day.\nThe ceremonies were conducted with the utmost feeling of respect and care. Pre ceremony we all had intention settings one- on- one with our facilitator. I mustn't gush too much; suffice to say I'm still stunned by how much that helped the whole experience and my personal healing. The solo processing after each ceremony was equally important for understanding and integrating the experiences. Highest quality support are words that can be used to describe this. The shamans... a whole little book could be written about them. Straight people! Totally dedicated, totally natural. They led the ceremonies like the great Maestro and Maestra they are. They even led the 'Camino del Tigre' jungle walk and showed us incredible plants. Their knowledge is vast and so is their humor!\nThe Ajo Sacha and Kambo ceremonies were such a great additional help, each in their unique way. I'm a kambo lover for life now,\nI miss RHC. I will always cherish it and what I experienced and learned. I hope I can come back.\nThank you! Thank you Omar, Christina, Anne, Heather... for each being and smile and gesture. Thank you to the staff! Thank you to the dogs and cats and the monkey- and to the majesty herself: The jungle.\n\nThis is truly a special gem on this planet! I went to the Rainforest Healing Center back in March on a recommendation from a friend. With ayahuasca being so popular these days, it was really important for me to find a place where i could have the most authentic healing experience. From the very start, upon my arrival, everyone was extremely caring. The group was small and everyone was there to resolve something in their lives. Prior to my trip i started speaking to Omar for quite some time. His dedication and guidance was so helpful and i really felt he was doing everything from his heart. I was very impressed with the amount of information, guidance and dialogue i received. He went out of his way to be there for us in any capacity. I felt comfortable and ready to embark on this important journey. The RHC is really made out of love and everyone involved is there because they believe in the healing power of the vine and other plants. There is a deep respect for nature and a careful selection of who they work with, what you eat, and the sessions you have. We had the most incredible shaman couple who gave their hearts into every ceremony with such power and compassion, its hard to describe. I cannot imagine a better place for such an important and delicate experience. i will definitely be back and i highly recommend it to anyone interested in a true healing experience.\nwith great gratitude,\nmagda\n\nI could spend hours writing about how incredibly breathtaking, loving and refreshing the entire process and experience was from the moment I made first contact with the staff at the Rainforest Healing Center until the present day-weeks after my return.\nLove, gratitude and kindness is at the center of it all! They truly are involved with every individual as well as the group as a whole. Your comfort, security and well-being are their top priority. From the beginning stages of the \u201cpre-purge\u201d to the day you leave the center, and even beyond, they are there for you in every possible way; from the cleanliness, maintenance of the property, quality of food, friendliness of every staff member (seen and unseen i.e. laundry and housekeeping) and even the animals living there, I felt like I was with a loving family.\nYou CAN NOT go wrong by choosing the Rainforest Healing Center. Not only is the cost great, but the value far exceeds what you would expect.\nIf you\u2019re reading this, look no further. You will feel at peace, make connections to last a lifetime and walk away only to leave a piece of your heart there.\n5 star service and experience.\nTo any of the staff reading this, much love and gratitude.\n\nMy time at the Rainforest Healing Centre was quite literally life changing.\nThere isn't much more to be added onto that statement really; the profoundness of life, the gratitude to the earth.. the love of all living things are all learned here.\nI really do hope you give yourself this gift and find this place.\nYou'll thank yourself forever.\n\nYou are probably reading this review because you have decided to work with a vary powerful medicine and you know this will be a life changing experience so you want to make sure you are choosing the right place. I can almost read your mind .... will these guys rip me off, will the Shaman be a genuine curadero, will I be left alone to face it all.... Well you can stop searching now, you have found it! The RHC is a place were you will feel safe, looked after and loved ..... super loved. I did the 11 days retreat in March 2018 and these guys changed my life.\nThe shamans I worked with were absolutely amazing, very knowledgable, loving, approachable and at times very funny. The staff , from facilitators to the cook, amazing!!! loving, caring people to say the least. I miss you all and thank you again for all your help. Eddy, Cristina, Cody you have taught me so much and I can never thank you enough. The place itself is beautiful and super well looked after. Conservation is a number 1 priority. This is what made me love RHC even more.\nOne piece of advice, trust them and follow their instructions. They know what they are talking about and only want the best for you.\nRHC you are the best!\n\nChoosing to attend the Rainforest Healing Center has been one the greatest gifts I have ever given myself and also has been one of the most incredible experiences of my life. The healing center is located smack dab in the middle of the Peruvian Amazon Rainforest and is a sight to behold. The sights, the smells, the feelings of awe and oneness with nature are difficult to describe in words. The staff went above and beyond in working with us and helping us and guiding us through the process of working with plant medicine and working on ourselves. They treated us with so much kindness, compassion and love and they truly gave themselves to us in order to facilitate our own healing. I am still in awe at the generosity and selflessness that my facilitators showed to me and the group.\nThe Healing center is aptly named and it truly has helped me in dealing with and coming to terms with many issues that have plagued me for my entire life such as issues pertaining to self love, fear and insecurity. It is a perfect and safe space to unplug from the modern world and go inside and do the deep cleaning work that is required if one wants to unburden themselves from the things that are no longer serving them in life. I could not recommend this healing center enough and I will forever be in deep gratitude to Omar, Eddie, the Shamans and the guests who truly helped me open my heart to the love and beauty that is in everyone of us and that surrounds us at all times.\nWith much love and gratitude in my heart,\nJames\n\nI highly recommend Chakra Alegria de Amor AKA the Rainforest Healing Center to my friends, to my family (parents, grandparents, you name it!!!), and - of course - to you! I attended an 11-day retreat, and every step of the process before, during, and after has led me closer to self and to source. After decades of suffering from C-PTSD, I learned to release ALL symptoms. No more panic attacks, night terrors, or avoidance behaviors\u2026 just a deep sense of self-acceptance, forgiveness, and safety. Oh - and community!!! The shaman and his apprentice check on my daily, the guests from my retreat cheer me on whenever I need support with integrating, and the administrators continue showing and sharing their love and support. Now, one week after my retreat, many people (coworkers, peers, and even strangers) tell me, \u201cYou look so happy!!\u201d Though the joy is palpable, that was never the point. I just wanted to feel *human* - and, fortunately, that was exactly what I needed (all guests get what they need). This healing center will make sure that your body, mind, and spirit are loved and protected. You will have countless opportunities for practicing sustainability, leading your own healing, respecting plants and animals, and compassionately witnessing yourself and others. Thanks to this healing center\u2019s facilitators and plant medicines, I am proudly pursuing a heart-centered approach to life, and death, and everything in between ????.\n\nThe entire team at Rainforest Healing Centre went above and beyond during the 11 day Ayahuasca Retreat. Rather than feeling like a guest, it felt like I was apart of a big family.\nThe healing, awareness, and removal of blocks that I experienced during ceremony was so profound that I've been inspired to one day right a book. If I could describe the retreat in one line, \"50 years of deep therapy in 5 ceremonies\" would sum it all up. It\u2019s been almost a week since I last drank and the effects of the medicine is still unfolding. It feels like there has been a huge weight lifted off my soul and I can fully breath to my capacity.\nThe Shaman, Don Joel was a 70+ y/o humble man who went out of his way to heal us with extra plant medicines, sacred baths, and special healing rituals. It was a nice bonus that was unexpected. We even got to be apart of the harvesting and brewing of the medicine.\nThe facilitators Esadora & Karin, made me feel safe and protected in the extreme jungle environment. What sets RHC apart is their intention setting and post ceremony integration meetings with the facilitator. Sometimes it felt like \"1000 bricks\u201d were dropped on my head and I had no idea what just happened. It was nice express my deepest insights, insecurities, and even doubts with someone who I fully trusted.\nThe supporting team made sure the tambos (huts) were clean and filtered water jugs filled. The tambos were nestled deep in the jungle for a truly authentic, peaceful and private jungle experience. A big thank you goes out to the extra helpers and chefs that kept us fed on the Aya-dieta and made sure the days went by smoothly.\nI highly recommend RHC to anyone who is seeking deep healing and a transformation on a soul level. I loved the small and intimate feeling of the retreat. After participating in the small group setting (8ppl), I don't know if I would ever go back to big groups of 25. I left the centre with a big smile, and I\u2019m going to miss everyone!\n-Eddy Phimphrachanh\n\nHi there,\nIt\u2019s been a little over a month ago now since I have left Rainforest Healing Center. This is a very aptly named. These people are serious about healing!\nFor instance there are free bi weekly integration meetings for past guests over the internet. That are very helpful in helping to adjust to our busy lives back home.\nI won\u2019t write much about the amazing facilities and staff, as they are just fantastic and already well-described in other guests\u2019 reviews.\nEverything is very professionally run by people who genuinely care and love what they are doing, something that really shows. I was really fortunately to receive a very generous family discount, otherwise I would not have been able to attend. Despite this, my opinion is in no way affected by this very kind act. This alone shows to me that this place is set up for helping people and not as a money maker. It shows in all the details of the centre.\nThe one word that keeps popping up to describe RHC is \u2018sincere'.\nFor a place as alien and challenging to city slickers as the jungle can be, great efforts have been made by the staff to make it as comfortable as it can get. It still is no 5-star luxurious resort and it will never be that. It\u2019s arguably a far richer experience than that! I personally had no issues being comfortable whatsoever.\nI have attended the 11-day ayahuasca retreat with added Ajo Sacha dieta for integration purposes. All I can say that it has done more for me than years of trying to find help for my issues (a mix of generalised anxiety, mild burnout and PTSD) here in the West, which I felt is just not available. And where the standard suggestion always seems to be to take some antidepressants, which I have always kindly declined.\nDeep down inside I knew that the root of my issues was trauma, regardless if it was caused by others or myself while being in a less conscious state. I had enough of these issues hampering my ability to live a full and satisfying life based on my own terms. I realised I had to go deep inside and get a more complete understanding of my condition and being.\nFor me the retreat was the way. It is like the reset button has been pressed and I can start rebuilding myself anew\u2014not being hampered by old trauma, and with greater awareness and consciousness. This is the real work that needs to be done and still is ongoing. And although the healing centre could/would never claim that they can heal, for legal reasons, take my word for it that it really does. Thanks to my time in the jungle I have managed to kick unhealthy habits such as drinking too much alcohol and caffeine, having a poor diet, and not exercising.\nI fully realise that I have been given this fantastic opportunity to change my life for the better and am now able to take full responsibility for my own well-being, something that I was not able to do to this extent before. This in itself has been very empowering. I am really grateful for this whole experience and am already able to experience moments of deep happiness and inner peace that I had never imagined possible.\nIn hindsight it is the best investment in myself that I could have ever made. Even at full price it would have been.\n\nI have attended RHC last May and I went for a 10 days retreat.\nthe place is absolutely amazing. you're surrounded by beautiful, big trees and plants. There's an atmosphere of peace and tranquility. The whole area is absolutely safe day and night so there's nothing to worry about really.\nI cannot be grateful enough about the Ayahuasca experience. I felt so much better once I left. But I have to admit it , I realised its wonderful benefits in full only when i returned home, back to the everyday life.\nMother ayahuasca helped me reconnecting with who i really am and with people too.\nShe helped getting rid that strong ego I built over the years,and a lot of my fears.\nI feel more positive towards life. I am more grounded and focused, more compassionate and caring with people.\nThe ceremonies in the Maloca are magical in the real sense. every ceremony is different and the outcome varies all the times, but I can guarantee is for the good and the best for you. The Shaman is a humble man and the Icaros he did sing boosted the whole experience during the ceremonies. He doesn't talk much but he definitely knows what he is doing. :)\nI am glad the centre hosts a few people only. And this is one of the reason why I picked RHC.\nThe facilitators played an important role. They supported me and the rest of the group by planning individual meetings to talk about the intentions, the way we felt , the ceremony feedback, suggestions and more.\nThe food was simple, delicious as well as nutritious. it was beyond my expectations!\nThanks Omar for building this beautiful healing centre and a big thanks to the facilitators ,especially Eren and Muri.\nThey made sure we had a great stay. and that's what happened.\nSo far, the best experience of my life.\nMuch love.\n\nI cannot speak highly enough about this center and the people who work there. I was guided and supported from the moment I had my interview to attend the retreat in July. I had various issues with my flights from being delayed to being cancelled, but Karin and the team never let me feel alone. They were communicating with me the whole time to make sure I arrived safely. This helped to start the retreat off on a good note for me. We all lived like a family, no one was more superior than the other. We were all one.\nThe center is so beautifully organized and built. The huts were very spacious and comfortable. There was enough space for you to put your stuff away and an amazing bed to sleep on too.\nThere is a lot of space for you to have 'me' time with a beautiful view and the sound of the jungle...the jungle really does not sleep! The toilet and bath facilities are great considering you are in the middle of the jungle. And the flower bath just topped up the day.\nThe ceremonies were so beautifully organised and managed. As this was my first time with Ayhuaska, I was nervous and anxious however the meetings I had with the facilitators before and after the ceremonies helped me to relax, accept, understand and surrender. I also participated in the Sapo/Kambo ceremony whilst I was there. I would have liked to see more ceremonies with other plant medicines such as Cacao and San Pedro. But I believe this is something they are looking at right now.\nI would definitely go back to this centre again, and next time I do, I will do an isolation retreat.\n\nI did two Ayahuasca ceremonies in the Netherlands and two in Portugal. In June this year I went for the first time to Peru to do a ten day Ayahuasca retreat with 5 ceremonies at RHC Chakra Alegria.\nBoth, Netherlands and Portugal, was a nice experience for me but only after Peru I really understand what Ayahuasca can do for you and how powerful this medicine is. It is comparing amateur football with Champions League!\nRHC wants to heal people and that\u2019s why they will only accept maximum 8 guests so that every person can get the full attention of the manager, it\u2019s staff and the Shaman.\nThe location is perfect, each Tambo stands alone while they\u2019re spread over the property. A bucket shower is like a blessing, your day will start happy! ???? Because of the more than 120 plants on the domain, the water is from an unheard quality, your hair will feel softer, your skin looks better.\nIt\u2019s not easy to prepare a good and delicious meal with the restrictions of the Aya diet but at RHC they manage to do so, food is of good quality and it is tasty.\nI want to say once more: \u2018Thank you very much Murielle\u2019\nMurielle is the manager at RHC and she is a fantastic person, dedicated her life to help others.\nShe travelled throughout the world, has passed her exam at the University of Life Cum Laude and in my opinion, that makes her the perfect person to run RHC and help the guests.\nThe Shaman was not only a nice person but also very professional, His brew was of high quality and he led the ceremonies in a very good way. Once the ceremony is finished, between midnight and 1 am, everyone sleeps in the Maloca, the Shaman and one of the staff will sleep there as well, so they will not leave you alone. As you can see at RHC they really care about you!\nThe rest of the staff and the volunteers, all nice and friendly people, all there to help you, also a big thank you to all of you.\nAnd don\u2019t forget Karin, she\u2019s the one you will meet first via Skype. I spoke to her for 1 \u00bd hour, I immediately had a good feeling and no doubts about the quality of RHC. Thank you as well.\nConclusion: If you\u2019re serious about healing and looking for a professional center I can recommend RHC Chakra Alegria with confidence and with all my heart. You don\u2019t have to look any further.\n\nI was in the isolation tambo, I was bathed in the love and light. I can see so many spirituality from the deep of the jungles. I can feel them touch me and my body, they are dancing and smoke the smudging that I can smell them. It is very peacefulness and love, the jungles have bought me into healing and peace. And during in my kambo frog, my third eye exploded and brung the beauty out of jungle that left me in awestruck of their beautiful. I want to be lost into their dreams of jungles with the ancestors and the kingdom. Ayahuasca drink that healed and bought me out of my childhood death that won't let me go, I have been fought for long time. The mother of vine broken the chain and bounded me from the death. I have been freed from the virus since age two. I have been transformed from kambo frog, uchu Sanango and ayahuasca. I feel so wholeness and I am!\n\nJust booked flights for my 2nd trip back over (from Australia) for this December coming. Considering my 1st stay with you was only 6 months ago, in December 2016, clearly I can\u2019t wait to get back. Last time I was lucky enough to travel over with my bestie and this time I get to bring my partner as well.\nKnowing what the healing space at Chakra Alegria De Amor has challenged and nourished within me, I feel grateful to be returning again and paying it (the love, light and healing) forward so soon.\nAnyway, in my revived excitement about returning, I felt compelled to revisit and reread your website\u2026 through the eyes of a now past guest\u2026 and I can tell you it kicked me right in the feels. Why? Because what you write about Chakra Alegria De Amor and how you portray it to be, is actually the truth. How beautiful is that?! See you lot again soon! xx\n\nI was fortunate enough to have spent a whole month at RHC because my best friend Karin is a team member there. For the first two weeks I was there as a volunteer, helping getting the center ready for the next group. During this time I had my private tambo, which was fantastic! The location of Tambo de Luz is spectacular because you look down on the rainforest and the bathing area is just mind-blowing. You\u2019re in the middle of pristine rainforest and especially towards dusk you can feel peace descend on the forest and the daytime creatures make room for the nocturnal creatures. This changing of the guards takes a good hour in which there is tremendous peace, which gave me a feeling of deep connection with nature and myself.\nI also want to tell you a little bit about my retreat. I was with a really nice group of people, very intimate, which was perfect for me. In Holland I had participated in a few large ceremonies of over 40 people but I quickly realised that this wasn\u2019t for me at all. So the intimate group size and the feeling of brother and sisterhood you have with your fellow retreat-goers and the staff is priceless.\nThe facilitator Muri helped me set my intentions for each ceremony. I couldn\u2019t have wished for a more loving person to walk me through my journey!! We had an amazing connection and she recognised many of the things I was dealing with, so she was a great support. Setting an intention before going into ceremony was a new experience for me, and I wished I had known about the importance of it before. In ceremony, it helped me a lot to direct my attention to the issues I wanted to work on. When I purged, I knew exactly what I was purging, which helped me heal my issues much more deeply. The shaman was another essential factor in my experience at the center. I felt a very strong connection with him, which was enhanced when I lay next to him in ceremony twice. Listening to his icaros released an array of emotions in me; comfort, joy, the feeling of being held, but also the push I needed to purge. His venteadas, or private sessions with me in ceremony, were so powerful! They would induce another wave of release in my ceremony.\nI wholeheartedly recommend RHC as a safe, warm and breathtakingly beautiful center in the middle of the Amazon. The staff and shaman are very loving and were always there for me. I am going back this year to continue my healing journey in this home away from home!\n\nWe absolutely loved our time here. The jungle is a special place and the people here are too. We were treated with respect and true kindness through out our time here. The people here truly care about you and your healing. You will receive one on one guidance throughout your process. I found this to be invaluable; starting from before we arrived in Peru to after our retreat. You are an individual, going through a unique experience and the people at Chakra Alegria understand that and will be there to support you during your journey. Would recommend and would return.\n\nHave been back a week now from spending 11 days in the Jungle at Chakra Alegria De Amor, aka Rainforest Healing Center. I've scanned the other reviews here, and wholly endorse their enthusiasm. I've considered myself almost a professional skeptic most of my life. I was concerned at the time, cost, and various forms of self-denial that this trip would require; mostly concerned that it would amount to chasing rainbows. But desperation drove me to give it a try... and it was all I (the inner me, beneath the skeptic that has run my life) had hoped. In short, it was really, really (REALLY) hard, and so worth it. The people, (Eren, Muri, Omar, Juan) were amazingly genuine, open, caring, and insightful. It wasn't just singing kum-ba-ya; was real, transformative, work. I have a hard time seeing how a club-med version could deliver the same. Also- the small group size they have at one time was... wonderful. We weren't cattle, or 'patients'; we had time to get to know each other, and the staff, which in turn allowed for impactful relationships to form. I'm so thankful to Omar for creating this space, and to Eren, Muri, and Juan for... sharing themselves. They say it's a non-profit, and it clearly clearly is. It's a labor of love for them all, and it shows. If you go, you'll be challenged, but if you're really seeking healing, and are open to it, you won't be disappointed. I know in our group, we all have come away knowing this: We were in the right place.\n\nProfessional, safe, supportive and genuine. Those four words would be my summary of my 10 day retreat at the Rainforest Healing Center (Chakra Alegr\u00eda de Amor, Joy of Love Farm) in December 2016. Highly recommended.\nEven though I am a somewhat na\u00efve person in regard to either therapy or hallucinogens, this experience was profoundly beneficial. Whilst an individual journey, I am thankful for the participant selection process also as I met some truly wonderful people.\nThe setting of the Peruvian Amazon is idyllic surrounded by more shades of green than you thought possible to house the fluro-blue butterflies, Mojo the colorful parrot etc etc. Other reviewers have described the carefully thought through facilities, which are accurate.\nSmall groups of eight people maximum allow a personal connection with staff and the shaman. I have heard of other groups where the participants number into the teens or even twenties; I find it hard to understand how there can be any personal connection or personal support with such a large group of people.\nThe information provided beforehand, whilst not overwhelming, was plentiful and allowed for good preparation. The journey starts when you sign up, not when you turn up. However, once arriving in the middle of the jungle the team very patiently re-iterated the most important information which was key for anyone who felt in unfamiliar territory, either physically in the jungle, or mentally for such an experience. The team offer follow-up afterwards.\nIt is not a free-ride. People who take ayahuasca can be referred to as 'pasajeros' or passengers, but that is only during the ceremonies. Whilst a magical experience, there are no magic wands with instant solutions, be prepared for some tough mental work. Good setting of intentions is vital, but beware that you may get different answers than what you expect. All extremely positive.\n\nInitially I had been very nervous about making this trip and what my experience might be like. Karin the administrator who interviewed me before I arrived was very helpful and walked me through my uneasiness and what I could expect once there and did her best to quell any fears that I had. But still for me an unknown which could not match what my imagination could conjuour up and did at times play somersaults in my head. I knew we were somewhere special, when after about an hour\u2019s hike through the jungle\u2019s muddy path we arrived at the Chakra Alegr\u00eda de Amor healing Forest. Before entering we were smudged on the boundary of the centre. The retreat for me started the moment I first went into the Malloka to discuss my intentions. I felt an energy, presence, vibration? I\u2019m not sure what really, because I struggle with these concepts generally. We were looked after and nothing was too much for the people who ran the centre, I would especially really like to thank Christina, Muriel they continously gave so much of themselves to us. Our tambo\u2019s were amazing 360 degrees of jungle views and sounds, bathing in the jungle was an experience I will always hold in my memory. I don\u2019t think I could have found a way to improve the experience. I came here to work on myself and that was the most difficult part, however the hard work was supported so lovingly by the facilitators and the Shaman who\u2019s icaros was enchanting. He also took us into the jungle to find out about the plant medicines and what they were used for. I went for the 7 days as an introduction course, which consisted of 3 ceremonies. I felt contained and very safe here and my ayahausca journey has just begun and I will be going back again as soon as I can for a longer visit to continue where I left off.\n\nThere simply aren't enough superlatives to describe Chakra Alegria de Amor and the beautiful people who run it. My wife and I went there for an Ayahuasca retreat as the focal point of our honeymoon in Peru, to help us heal past pain and prepare for the rest of our lives together, hopefully as parents in the near future. We are forever changed by the amazing experiences we had there.\nThe CAA team couldn't have been more helpful with their online resources in the months prior to going on retreat. Karin in particular was a source of many gratefully-received pieces of advice, and her recommendation of Hotel La Casona was a very good one for the overnight stay in Iquitos, prior to entering the jungle.\nRight from the moment we arrived at CAA, and throughout our time there, we felt loved, safe and protected by everyone (everyone being Christian, Cristina, Eren, Juanita, Karin, Muriel, our host Omar, the jungle workers, the jungle Herself and the omnipresent Mother Ayahuasca). The whole experience was magical and cleansing. The people of CAA work so hard to make it the best possible spiritual journey for the guests, with love at the core of everything they do. They are crusaders of light and wisdom with hearts of pure gold.\nThe land is treated with the highest regard, and the Mother Vine is re-planted abundantly in place of that which is harvested. The medicine is brewed and blessed with love.\nThe ceremonies themselves are carried out with the utmost respect and integrity. The facilitators genuinely care, and are always there when needed during ceremony. Christian, the shaman, is truly incredible. He has a great wealth of knowledge, experience, and insight. His ritual practices are time-honoured and beautiful, as are his icaros. He has a humble and jovial personality too.\nThe medicine is potent and I am still processing everything I went through. Suffice to say I feel my personal healing has been accelerated and I have been shown some profound truths.\nAjo Sacha was available as an optional extra, again administered with maximum respect for the medicine and its tradition. Kambo was offered and lovingly applied by Cristina. Lou and I love our Kambo scars! They're a reminder of an amazing journey, both inner and outer. The center also provides Chiric Sanango and Uchu Sanango dietas.\nThe food, lovingly prepared by the naturally maternal Juanita, was delicious.\nThe tambos are a delight to stay in! The connectedness with nature is unparalleled and the bucket showers are the most refreshing imaginable.\nI would recommend CAA to EVERYBODY, and would also say that it's a fantastic place at which to volunteer. We met Jimbo while we were there, a volunteer and traveler by trade, who was very happy in his work, and was yet another amazingly friendly, kind and helpful presence.\nThank you again, CAA. All of you. Lou and I think you're amazing. We're deeply grateful and always will be.\n\nI could not have asked for a more safe place and for better guidance as I received at my stay in the Rainforest Healing Center, Chakra Alegr\u00eda de Amor. Going through the experience with Ayahuasca can be the hardest thing you'll ever have to do. So for me I am forever great full for the support, guidance and unlimited love I received during my stay. Not holding back by saying I could not have done the healing I did with (Ayahuasca, kambo and Ajo Sacha) without the wonderful people that work there. So much gratitude and love to every single one. The safety it gives you when everyone that works there knows your name. The intimacy by being a small group so everyone will get noticed, and can be taken care off in the best way possible was so vital to my healing. I hope who ever reads this will have a beautiful and safe journey, Pachamama will guide you with all her love\n\nIt was simply such a blesssing to have found the Rainforest Healing Centre. Making my way to the other side of the planet for this pilgrimage literally took years of preparation, consideration and saving. Originally, I had intended on going to another, well known, retreat. However, once I was in the position to make the decision, something made me look even further than I already had. I am so glad that I did. Amidst all of the other recommendations from North American friends (for whom the distance is not so vast) and internet adverstisements there was something about this place that just had me inquire.\nFrom the first conversation with the intake administrator to the first day at the retreat to finally leaving 18 days later (it was an extended stay), the intention and the integrity of the staff involved with this centre really resonated with me. I, and my partner who also attended, felt comtpletely safe and perfectly cared for the whole time. The facilities are very basic but are just what is needed. The food was very simple, healthy, prepared with love and amazing! We still try to emulate a couple of the meals at home. The centre keeps the groups small in number. This provides for a very personal and intimate space where each person's experience, and their safety, can be optimised.\nThe Rainforest Healing Centre and all of the people involved there are an absolute blessing. We are so very grateful for having had the opportunity conduct our cleansing, grounding, re-setting and healing with them at their beautiful centre.\n\neep inside the Amazon Jungle, there resides a special place some may call it paradise,. Where all are welcome and treated with the same love and respect and this place is called \u201cChakra Alegr\u00eda De Amor\u201d.\nWhat makes this place so special is the staff, the care and attention the love is unparalleled and from the bottom of my heart I cannot thank you enough.\nThe Ayahuasca retreat with Rebecca Sharman is truly magical and a unique experience, you will never find any experience like it, this is a hidden gem not to be missed.\n2 Sharmen\u2019s, the balance of female and male energies, singing Ikaros together in perfect linguistic harmony.\nI highly recommend Chakra Alegr\u00eda De Amor, a place of mystical beauty, love, amazement, animals, true deep healing and a connection you have never felt before. As the transformative energies, cleanse and heal you into a new version of yourself.\n- See more at: http://openmindtrips.com/retreats/peru/loreto/iquitos-1/chakra-alegria-de-amor/#reviews\n\nWhen I decided to go to Peru I spoke with several friends who had been on retreats before, but I wanted my journey to be my own. I wanted to find a center for myself, where it would be a clean slate without any expectations. I found CAA online, and I will admit I was a bit nervous about going. It looked wonderful, but I had never worked with Ayahuasca before, and it felt like taking a huge leap of faith to trust a place and the people there without hearing firsthand that I should. But I took that leap, and I am eternally grateful that I did.\nThe first thing I really appreciated was the screening process. It gave me confidence that the staff at CAA was as interested in making sure I was a good fit for the center as I was about them. It also helped create the amazing family that I ended up sharing my experience with. Other centers don't have a screening process. You just have to hope that you end up with a group of people with whom you are compatible. But CAA takes that extra step to ensure that you're going to be with like-minded people; ones who are there to share their journey with you and support each other along the way. That is exactly the kind of group I ended up with as a result. Plus, Karin is wonderful :) She was so kind and genuine during our interview, and I knew that if the rest of the staff was anything like her that I had chosen the right place.\nI won't go into details about my personal journey while I was there, because everyone's is unique and hearing about my work with the Vine isn't what will help you learn about CAA. I will say that my work was often very difficult for me, and I am so grateful that the staff at CAA is who they are. I don't know that the experience would have been what is was for me if I didn't have them. Yes, the journey is an individual one, and ultimately the work to be done was my own. That's why I appreciate Omar, Matt, and Cristina so much. They allowed me to do the work myself- and pushed me to do it when I needed it- but supported me the whole time. They had such an incredible balance between them as a team. There was softness and compassion, yet they held me accountable and didn't let me off the hook. They were there to hold my hand when I needed it, and there to support me from afar when I didn't. I truly felt like they cared about my experience. When I triumphed, they triumphed.\nOne of the things I loved about Omar's approach to the experience, was the incorporation of processing. Working with Mother Ayahuasca can be an extremely intense experience, and I think it is incredibly helpful to be able to process the thoughts and feelings that come up with others. Again, the journey is an individual one at the end of the day. It was important that we all spent time processing on our own. And we did. We were encouraged to spend time on our own and given all the time we needed to do so. But I also think it can be beneficial to work through stuff with other people. Omar, Matt, and Cristina, were always available to talk about things with us. And happy to do so. I never felt like a burden when I asked to speak with them. They were all incredibly patient and spent as much time with us as we needed. I am so grateful for their openness and kindness.\nIn addition to having an amazing team of facilitators, I couldn't have asked for a better curandero. Pedro is one of the kindest souls I have ever met. He is so calm and comforting. He wasn't removed from us like I know some others can be. He spent time with us. He laughed with us. I felt so safe during ceremony knowing he was there to guide us. He also has the best smile I have ever seen and his laugh will make your heart smile.\nOne of my other favorite things about the experience at CAA (there are a million), is that we were involved in every part of making the Medicine. We picked Chacruna leaves, we beat the vine, we cooked the medicine together, putting everything together by hand. We even got to plant new vine for future generations. It really helped me connect to the process and made the experience that much more meaningful. We did all of those things with Pedro, so it helped us connect with him as well. Omar taught us about the medicine and sat with it with us. Matt even sang to it with us :) Cristina helped us plant the vine. They were there for every part of the process. It was awesome that they were all so involved in our experience.\nI wasn't worried about the facility itself, though I give that the highest marks as well. The tambos were incredibly nice and well-kept. The food that our wonderful and awesomely smiley chef, Juanita, prepared for us every day was delicious and nourishing. The staff was so helpful and friendly. They work so hard and always do it with a smile. And the jungle is just beautiful.\nI will never forget my experience at CAA- I carry it in my heart every day. I am so grateful to everyone there for sharing my journey with me. And I can't wait to go back :)\nSo much love to you all!!\n\nI had never done Ayahuasca before and I'm so glad I chose to have this life enhancing experience at Rainforest Healing Center. I was exploring Ayahuasca because, though I felt I had made tremendous self- awareness progress through my bi- weekly therapy, the occasional yoga class I showed up frazzled and late for, and the sea of self help books I would purchase during torturous layovers at the airport, I was still in a lot of pain and inherently knew I had some healing to do. I'm a very busy 40 year old female executive, and I mention that, because my work identity made it a difficult decision to commit to this trip. Was I going to come back a crazy tree-hugging hippie? I'm far too busy for that. Will I release horrible demons and regress to an angry teenager? That sounded dreadful. I was scared, so safety and legitimacy were my top concerns. The rainforest healing center was, in fact, safe, professional, and very high-touch. I'm so happy with the compassionate staff. Their encouragement and reassurance enabled me to work with the ayahuasca knowing I was in good hands.\nMy 5 recommendations\n1. Don't be scared, just go to Rainforest Healing Center. They'll guide you, just get there.\n2. The experience may be hard work for you, and you may feel scared or exhausted, but keep going! I did and I'm better for it!\n3. It's the jungle, not a resort, \"one with nature\" takes on a new meaning. Bring enough clothes to wear clean things and bring bug repellent.\n4. Try to recognize your ego beforehand, you're going to need to admit it is there, in order to kick it to the curb, so the medicine can work best.\n5. Spend time with the staff. They are amazing people. Their mission to combat addiction, depression, and help literally everyone with anything, is real! Don't take ayahuasca with just anyone, at Rainforest Healing Center, they are the real deal, go there, you'll see.\nThank you for reading my review. I hope you make this investment like I did. It makes me happy just to think of you going to The Rainforest Healing Center. You can do it!\n\nI spent 6 of the most life changing, memorable days of my life at the Rain Forest Healing Center in March, 2016. For my first Ayahuasca experience I spent months researching the many retreat centers in Peru. One of the biggest deciding factors in choosing the RFHC was that they only have groups of 10 or fewer at any one time. I am a 53 year old professional women and I wanted my experience to feel very personal. I didn't want to be one of a much larger group. Omar, Cristina and Mat treat you like you're family. They care for you every step of your journey. During ceremony they're at your side if you need them, always close by. After ceremony they are 100% available to talk, cry, laugh no matter how much your need to hash through your thoughts and feelings, they're there.....their support is amazing. Our Shaman, Christian was absolutely wonderful. His Icaros are incredibly powerful and you will never forget the beautiful sound of them. I came away feeling powerful, full of love and my heart is more open than I ever thought possible. I feel my experience was as strong as it was because of the staff. At all times I felt safe, loved and protected. This journey has just begun, I cannot wait to return to continue it with the loving, caring souls of the Rain Forest Healing Center. Thank you Omar, Cristina and Matt.....much, much love!!\n\nHola! I'm from Ukraine living in Dubai... Just came back from 7 days retreat in rainforest and would like to share my experience..\nThis is a magic place created with love and care.. Nature is amazing and completely dicnect you from this reality.. But also people.. All of them are big magic ayahuasca family and they are spreading their love on everyone) shearing their kindness support care generosity..\nVery important how Matt Omar and Christina are taking care and helping to all guests..during ceremonies and even after (when you need a guidance to help you understand everything what happened with you)..\nAnd how powerful and carying is Shaman! It's unbelievable..????\nMy ceremonies were amazing..I had a great experience which is hard to describe with words... There are different ways how ayahuasca is healing and teaching you..she knows what is better for everyone and giving her wisdom and magic generously.. I'm so impressed with atmosphere and still in my dreams I'm coming back to the jungles and feel connection with mother Aya...\nThank you so much..for everything you've done and keep doing..\nWish you more and more love inspiration and positive energy..\nWith love\nAntonina????????????\n\nI did a 7 day ayahuasca retreat in January 2016 at Rainforest Healing Center in Iquitos (Chakra Alegr\u00eda de Amor, The Joy of Love Farm). I had a great experience and highly recommend it. It was my first time, whereas some of my fellow students have done it before, and we all agreed it was an amazing journey. Omar, Christina, and Matt are experienced, caring professionals with a true commitment to guiding their students along the healing process. The shaman Cesar, and his apprentice Jenny, are strong and gentle practitioners of ayahuasca and provided powerful ceremonies for us.\nChoosing the right healing center is critical for a good experience with ayahuasca so I signed up for Rainforest Healing Center based on a recommendation from a friend I made at a 10 day silent meditation retreat (Vipassana) in Thailand two months ago.\nThe staff provided excellent support and guidance throughout the entire process. From their informative website, to the Skype interview process with the administrator Karin in Amsterdam (critical for screening out people who would be disruptive, disrespectful, or just looking for a recreational drug experience), their comprehensive pre-departure briefing materials (covering the dieta, the agenda, the facilities, and other frequently asked questions), to guiding us during the ceremonies (reminding us to focus on our intentions, focus on what we were purging), to helping us process our visions the morning after the ceremonies. The information provided was not only comprehensive but also timely (Karin seemed to anticipate when we'd have what questions). The center reminded us several times that they were still available to us as a resource even after we left, they referred to us as being part of their family and we are encouraged to reach out for more guidance on how to implement the wisdom imparted to us by Mother Ayahuasca.\nI did not opt for the ajo sacha but a few in my group did.\nThe groups are generally limited to 8 participants but my retreat had 10 people, due to overwhelming demand and also Omar's interest in bringing the ayahuasca healing to as many people as possible. Because the screening process results in like-minded, sincere and committed classmates, I was happy there were 10 of us.\nThe tambos are very large and clean, and the toilet and bathing facilities were also clean and comfortable. The food was good despite the heavy dietary restrictions. Juanita cooks and also does laundry. Leo did a great job looking after our tambos and porting our bags.\nThe only unpleasant experience I would report would be the mosquitoes, but, well that's the Amazon. Bring double or triple the amount of repellent and after-bite than you think you'd need. The 3 kilometer hike through the jungle to the campus wasn't fun either but most others enjoyed it.\nChristina, 34\nSan Francisco, California\n\nIf you\u2019re currently looking for an Ayahuasca retreat, stop looking. You\u2019ve found the right place. I couldn\u2019t have asked for a better experience at the Rainforest Healing Center. Thanks to Karin, Omar, the shamans Pedro and Cesar, Juanita, and the rest of the crew, my life was changed. Trust me, this is the real deal. No tricks here, just unconditional love, respect, and a deep connection with the medicine.\nThat being said, there\u2019s a reason you found out about Ayahuasca and the Rainforest Healing Center. Trust your gut and go with your intuition. I didn\u2019t find this healing center until last minute, and it was by far the best decision I\u2019ve ever made in my life.\nThe healing center is absolutely gorgeous! It\u2019s far from town in the middle of the jungle, which is perfect for meditation and connecting with nature. You\u2019ll only find positive energy and love here. The fresh food, hospitality, and everything else are out of this world. It makes for an unforgettable experience! Prices are more than reasonable compared to other retreats, and everything was done professionally with love and care. I felt safe and well taken care of while I was there.\nI participated in three ceremonies between December 14-20th, 2015. I learned more than I would in ten lifetimes. By the end of it all, I was cleansed of all the negative energy that affected me before. And the effects are still with me weeks later. I\u2019m happy, more grounded with myself and Earth, more calm, and at peace. I have a new perspective on life. When things get rough, I\u2019m always reminded that everything is going to be okay. Mother Ayahuasca will heal you, and guide you to a better life. Afterwords, the last half of the healing process is up to you.\nIf you\u2019re ready to change your life for the better, go for it. You won\u2019t regret it.\nI\u2019m so grateful for my experience. A huge thanks to Pedro for helping me as much as he did. And a special thanks to Omar and Don Kucho!!! But that\u2019s another story. :)\nMuch love,\nRichard\n\nI recently did 5 Ayahuasca ceremonies and an 8 day dieta of Chirik Sanango at this center, and had a life altering healing experience. The center has a serious and respectful approach, the staff provide helpful guidance about what to expect and also help you process and integrate your experiences. The food tastes great, especially considering it's prepared without salt. The shaman was very helpful, talented and definitely 'the real deal'. The setting was also very powerful with the jungle all around me as I was very cozy in my beautiful tambo. All in all an unforgettable experience...\n\nI learned so much from this center. The owner was friendly and informative with the integration. The staff was wonderful, and I felt safe with the shaman and curandera. I recommend this center for those who are serious about getting healed.\n\nI don\u2019t really know were to start. But the first thing that pops in my head when I think about our experience at Chakra Alegria de Amor (Rainforest healing center) is: WOW..that it was the best thing that happened to me in 3 years of travelling, and even one of the best things in my life. If you are searching around on the web for the perfect Ayahuasca retreat, stop searching further, because you have found it!\nWhen we arrived in Peru a month ago (October 2015). I could not stop thinking about Ayahuasca. I felt an extremely strong urge to do it. I intensely felt I needed this.\nOf course I was a bit afraid and nervous. You hear and read so many scary stories about other people\u2019s experiences and about dodgy shamans and centers. So I spend a few days researching on the web. Than I found Chakra Alegria de Amor and knew right away this was the place for me to go. An animal rescue center, small retreat groups, English speaking people, Permaculture farm, Jungle huts and an experienced Shaman, this is what I wanted.\nI emailed back and forth with the Lovely administrator Karin (Who is Dutch like me). She answered all questions really quickly and told me everything I needed to know. We were lucky enough that there we two spaces available for the following week and so we started the Ayahuasca diet straight away.\nOmar picked us up from Iquitos and together with the other participant we made our way to the Jungle. I felt comfortable straight away because of Omars caring and funny personality. His workers even helped me carrying my bag to the retreat. Which is about a 45min walk into the jungle.\nWe were greeted by Gaja the dog, Mojo the bird and Zoey the monkey, who became my new best friend during our stay.\nEveryone got their own private tamboo, which are placed isolated in the jungle. From the main area, you walk for about 10 mins over beautiful paths to get there. The tamboos are so cool. In the middle of the rainforest, with your own bucket/stream to wash yourself. Surrounded by huge butterflies, bright colored frogs, monkeys and noisy insects.\nThanks to Juanita we got delicious Ayahusca diet food 3 times a day (2x on Ceremony days). She is such a friendly and caring woman, and even massaged me one day after the ceremony when my muscles felt tense.\nThere were two shamans that led the ceremonies. The first two ceremonies Ceassar helpt us healing. In the third ceremony Pedro assisted him as well.\nI am so grateful for both of them. They really knew what they are doing and take the healing very seriously. Ceassars Icaros are the best ever! I could not stop dancing during the ceremonies, even though I was laying on my mat.\nAnd then Omar..You can see the passion in him to help other people. I don\u2019t know how he does it. How he can listen to everyone\u2019s problems day in and day out, always knows an answer to questions and gives perfect advice to every problem.\nWe became good friends during our stay and I hope we will stay this forever.\nThe ceremonies were sometimes quit intense for me and Omar or Charlene (the volunteer) were always there to help out, talk to me when needed or help people going to the toilet. I definitely got some important insights out of the ceremonies. In one of them I felt as happy as I never felt before, ever in my life. Happy about myself, happy about others, happy about life in general. In others I had to learn how to let go, stop trying to control life and trust in the universe.\nI am super grateful to everyone who made the experience so unforgettable and I hope I can come back in the future to take the healing to the next level and maybe do one of their Master plant diets.\nLike I said before this is the best place to go to if you are looking to get to know more about yourself, heal and change in a very positive way.\nThanks everyone!\nXxx Thaila\n\nLast month I was lucky enough to go to the Chakra Alegria de Amor - Rainforest Healing Centre.\nI had initially done a lot of research into which centre to go to and from the reviews and overall information from the site I sensed a good vibe about this centre and I must admit I am really happy with my decision.\nI decided to go on the 10-day retreat and what I got from the experience was more than I could have ever imagined. To describe an experience as profound can possibly be seen as an exaggeration, however I had received a lot of healing, dealt with a lot of personal BS that has been holding me back for most of my adult life, and learnt some things that I was not expecting.\nThe retreat is well run and I felt reassured after talks about the medicine pre-ceremony, all early concerns and fears were put aside, being that this was my first experience with Ayahuasca I felt relaxed being at this centre. The medicine was highly respected here and in no way did this place offer an 'Ayahuasca-Tourist' experience for people to just 'trip out'. Everyone participating seemed to be there with good intentions and this seemed supported by Omar and his team.\nThe ceremonies, performed by Pedro were beautiful, all whilst feeling safe throughout. The aftercare and one-to-one chats offered by Omar were personal and reassuringly comforting whilst trying to process the mental download from the medicine. The information I received from the ceremonies was shocking and liberating at the same time. Omar was very supportive I was able to make some sense of the whole experience through talking to someone who has also benefited from the medicine himself.\nI enjoyed time with the group I was at the retreat with and it was nice to be doing the ceremonies in a small group, this was one of the main reasons for me choosing this retreat as it would allow for a more personal experience and assistance which I thought was super important.\nConsidering we were all in the middle of the jungle the accommodation was great and offered a comfortable resting place pre and post ceremony. The food served by the sweet Juanita was pleasantly tasty, considering the diet we have been on for the retreat, we were well looked after and personally I really enjoyed the food.\nIt would be hard for me not to recommend Chakra Alegria de Amor as I got so much from my visit. I went with deeply personal reasons and feel that I got more than I could have ever expected, I am by no way healed but I have made a huge step towards self acceptance and understanding of my problems. The centre definitely helped me in getting these results. From my first interactions with Karin regarding the 10-day retreat I had a good sense that the centre had a personal approach and this was true to the end of the retreat.\nThe whole experience has been positively life changing. I am hoping to continue the positivity whilst still processing the information given to me from Mother Vine.\nIf you have been considering taking Ayahuasca to help with personal healing and looking for a centre has become overwhelming, I believe you can put trust in this place, just like so many others have too.\nMany thanks to Omar and the team.\n\nChakra Alegria de Amor is a sacred spot in the heart of the Rainforest. Not only is the land itself blessed with native medicinal plant life, but the dedicated staff ensures its ongoing growth and respects its powers for traditional healing and ceremonial purposes. The center's beautifully eco-manicured grounds make it possible to be completely immersed in the physical beauty and spirit of the jungle while ensuring the safety and comfort of their guests. While everyone attending should be on a personal journey for self (re)discovery, the support and care I received from the staff and fellow 'retreaters' was invaluable and endearing beyond expectations...I loved the challenges and awakenings I experienced so much that although I initially signed up for the 3 ceremony retreat package, I ended up staying longer to participate in 5 ceremonies!\n\nMy intention for heading to Rainforest Healing Center Chakra Alegria de Amor (RFHC) was very clear. I had for as long as I can remember been hampered by a deep seated existential fear. Despite well over a decade of intentional work to clear past charges this was one that stubbornly refused to budge.\nIt was when I started to realise how instrumental this fear was in catalysing so many of my fearful actions, reeking havoc in my relationships, that I decided enough was enough. Around that time I was conveniently presented with information on Ayahuasca and after doing some research came across and booked into RFHC. 2 weeks later I was on my way to Peru.\nWell, I didn't have to wait long to get stuck into it. My first ceremony proved to be a very powerful and transformative experience. I literally went to the hell in my mind. It was a challenging experience but at some point I saw how I had been carrying a deep seated belief from early childhood that should I act or not act in certain ways I would indeed go to \u2018so called\u2019 hell. The hell I had created in my mind was not something that could be survived hence the fear. This knowledge had of course been suppressed and forgotten many years ago. So the fear had continued to work away undermining pretty much anything I chose to do or not do. Until NOW!!! I am finally free of it.\nOver the last few years one of the most perplexing questions I have struggled with was the question of what are my deepest wishes. What is that I most deeply long for. I asked this question during a ceremony but it is only now on writing this piece that the answer has dropped in. I long to be able to honour the quiet and often simple truth that sits in me. I long to be able to express myself, from this place, as truthfully and wholeheartedly as possible without limiting myself to avoid the disapproval of others.\nI have always had a tendency to withdraw, so desperately in fear of attracting criticism I sealed off my inner world from my outer one. Inwardly a venturer into world of the mind, discovering and releasing identities but outwardly in denial of this new found space. And yet I was wondering why I lacked passion and a sense of purpose in my life. I was simply too afraid to embrace a way of living that so went against everything that I had been conditioned to believe. Though it sounds perhaps far fetched, the truth was that I felt mortally threatened by the disfavour of others. And so I rarely spoke my deeper truth. I rarely told people what I truly thought. I held back and lived in the shadows of life. When the ayahuasca showed me the hell in my mind I was terrified. But then I moved through it. And it didn't kill me. I survived and I now know it isn't real. My expressions can no longer mortally threaten me.\nI am so incredibly grateful for these healing gifts. The power of working with Ayahuasca supported by such a dedicated Shaman duo of Pedro and Rossita has, I am convinced, saved me years of more traditional spiritual work in uncovering these unconscious beliefs and dissolving the associated emotional charges.\nThe RFHC is a indeed set on sacred land. Despite being set in virgin rain forest I never felt in anyway threatened by the setting and the creatures that exist there. Bathing each day in the pure healing waters of a forest stream, being lulled to sleep by the forest symphony and witnessing the clarity of the stars in a place where ambient light is an unknown. Just 3 of many rich experiences that supported the unfolding of my healing journey at RFHC.\nNone of this would have been possible without Omar, his connection to mother ayahuasca and that huge heart of his. The moment I looked into his eyes when we met in Iquitos prior to heading off I knew that I was in very good hands. He has no hesitation in putting you straight should you be heading off-course which is a blessing. Omar has built an excellent team or rather extended family of smiling, open hearted helpers including the lovely Junita who prepared the most delicious food you could hope for especially given that salt, oil, dairy and spices are off limits for the ayahuasca diet. Amongst his RFHC close family are one very cheeky and tactile orphaned capucchino monkey Zoe and a rescued Macaw called Mojo.\nPedro, the ayahauscero with he milky blue eyes, displays an extraordinary level of dedication to serving participants. I\u2019m not sure when he sleeps because he appeared in the middle of the night on several occasions with healing remedies and on ceremony nights he worked late into the night attending to our needs. Thank you Pedro!\nAnd Rossita, I cannot stop smiling when I catch sight of her. She\u2019s been working with ayahuasca since she was 13, trained by her mother as she has trained her daughter and is training her grand children. Her Icaro\u2019s dramatically opened the space of my experiences particularly when I was feeling challenged. Despite being in her years she seems to retain the purity and innocence of a young child along with the wisdom and stature that her long experience gives her. Thank you Rossita!\nThank you Omar!!! for creating this incredible healing sanctuary, offering me your open heart and your friendship. And thank you to each of your team for their part in making the experience at RFHC such a success.\nBig Love\nWilliam\n\nI had MyJourneyToMyself with 10 days of Ayahuasca & 8 days of Chiric Sanango Master Plant Isolation Diet @ this beautiful magical place Chakra Alegr\u00eda de Amor Rainforest Healing Center in Iquitos Peru.\nThese three weeks have been the most sacred & profound of my life. I am completely transformed. I dived deep into my heart, healed everything I needed to heal & I am reborn.\nEndless gratitude & love from the bottom of my heart to\n- Omar for the creation & managing of this magical healing center Chakra Alegria De Amor at the sacred location in the Jungle with the beautiful comfortable tambos, the organization of the trip with so much care & attention to all the details, for the conversations & support during my hard times.\n- Angel Tiffany for supporting & encouraging with her being at all times, for her big heart & unconditional care.\n- Huanita for cooking delicious healthy food with so much love - inspiring me to start cooking (was having big resistance to cooking always!) and to finding the love to nurture myself. Not to forget her latina musica was exactly what I needed.\n- All the helpers who kept everything in order and being always very kind and helpful.\n- Beautiful Shaman Soul Rosita for her powerful icaros & support during the ceremonies and her peaceful presence.\n- The Shaman Pedro for his vast plant wisdom, the ceremonies, his powerful icaros and for being always there for me with so much unconditional love, care & dedication.\n- The Jungle for all its magnificence, love & teachings, its beauty, magic, peace & providing us all the sacred plants for our healing.\nThese Plant Spirits: La Medicina Mama Ayahuasca & Dr. Chiric Sanango have transformed me beyond my wildest expectations.\nWords are not able to express this strong healing which happened holistically on all levels deep down to the cellular level.\nI felt & experienced & understood my pain, suffering & negativity and could release it all and leave it all behind.\nI found Myself & have gained immense understanding about Myself, life and the Universe: such a huge learning experience.\nI had never felt so much gratitude in my life. I was bathing in gratitude and divine love.\nI am so endlessly grateful that The Mother Vine, La Medicina called me. Love You.\nIt was the scariest, hardest, most exhausting & demanding work I have done on myself facing all what was deep down within me & at the same time the most precious divine experience of unconditional love & self-love, bliss, peace and freedom. Not only during the ceremonies, as well as during the entire time there - the learning and expanding was ongoing, as well as after I came back home. The evolvement never ends. And the spirit remains within me.\nFor the first time in my life I am falling in love with myself, my life and have the knowingness that I am transformed, healed.\nI forgave everyone, I let go all negativity, suffering and limitations.\nLove is our BIRTHRIGHT!\nEndless Gratitude & Love,\nSemiha\n\nThis is a beautiful and sacred (and very safe!) environment to do deep healing work, while surrounded by pristine jungle, staying in comfortable tambos, and cared for by true healers. I can't say enough about the shaman, Pedro, who is such a beautiful soul. I felt so cared for and I carry my sacred experiences of this retreat in my heart and soul. I highly recommend Chakre Alegria de Amor to anyone ready to undertake a life transforming journey.\n\nWhere you'll understand and feel the true meaning of unconditional love...\n\nThere are not enough words to describe the experience that I lived through Mother Ayahuasca at CAA. You got to live it to feel it...And one thing I know for sure and I'll sing it to the seven seas...it was definitely the best and most intense experience of my life :)\nHow did I end up at CAA? I actually got lost, had a blackout and woke up there...hehe just kidding! Well, you can browse and research online for a long long time and you'll find tons of different places with nice reviews that will leave you confused and indecisive about where to go...It is a life changing experience so there is a certain pressure about choosing the right place...and that's why I waited forl the right moment and trust me, you'll know when it comes ;)\nFor years I had been hearing and reading articles about Ayahuasca, even Al Jazeera talked about it! Then one day, I saw that a friend of mine had posted pictures on his Facebook about Ayahuasca and his stay at CAA and I thought the world was gonna end! He's one of the most logical and skeptical people I've ever met, so I contacted him straight away and we met. So this was the moment when I knew, where it felt right. He didn't have to convince me to hard, everything he was saying was making perfect sense to me and next thing I knew, I followed my gut feeling and there I was on a airplane (actually 3) on my way to Iquitos and about to know the true meaning of unconditional love.\nHe told me that I could trust the centre and everyone working there with my eyes wide shut and so I did. They make you feel like you belong there and their genuine interest in helping you is so obvious that only leaves space for you to focus on your healing and nothing else. Loved the fact that I was in the middle of the Amazon and surrounded by nature...you feel connected to everything and everybody...Food is amazing there and everything is done as natural as possible. The centre also doesn't take more than 8 people for retreat which is great...\nWhen you decide to experience Ayahuasca is very important to feel safe and supported, as what you'll be going through can be compared to the biggest and wildest rollercoaster. At CAA you always have hands to support you and be there for you at your darkest moment...I had and I'll be eternally thankful for that...\nIt's not just a business, it's a group of people trying to make the difference and genuinely helping us all in the best way they can. They also have the cutest and sweetest dog ever...beautiful Gaia...miss her so much :( There's also Luna, the cat, but I'm more of a dog person.\nI was very sad when I had to leave and come back to reality after 10 days...got in there with a heavy backpack (literally and figuratively) but left lighter than ever! I had never felt so much love and happiness like I felt there and many of my deep hounds were healed, specially my depression...obviously you are always learning and changing and healing is always needed throughout your life...otherwise we would all be perfect and I haven't met anyone else who's perfect besides me ;) hehe joking again!\nI made a new family there that I know I'll always be able to count on and we'll be eternally connected, no matter where we'll be. Don't be afraid and follow your instinct...\n\"The night is at its darkest just before the dawn\".\n\nComing from the corporate world completely lost and desperate, I found exactly what I was looking for and more: the spiritual healing, guidance, acceptance, love & light. The place is full of positive energy, Pedro the shaman was so kind, helpful and knowledgeable, the food was excellent and the staff were super friendly. I can't wait to go back and I would highly recommend to everyone!\n\nWow, where to begin on Chakra Alegria De Amor,\nFirst of all this was not my first ayahuasca retreat centre, but it will definitely be the last. That's not to say i won't be going back to Peru, but i believe i've found \"the one\" in this centre, it's shaman Pedro, and it's owner/facilitator Omar. My other ayahuasca experiences had been somewhat useful in changing the direction of my life but i had begun to lose faith that the medicine could help me with my emotional, and psychological problems (depersonalisation disorder). This place fully restored that faith and then some. Omar is a beautiful soul and a down to earth dude who is just as much up for a good laugh as he is for a deep conversation about the progress of your healing, he's now a friend for life. Pedro the shaman is one of the most beautiful uplifting characters i've ever met in my life, I was skeptical at first because he is a young shaman (in his 30's) and everybody's idea of a stereotypical top shaman is some 80 year old Peruvian who's been working with the medicine from an early age.\nPedro blew all of my previous shaman's out of the water, with the loving, light, youthful, caring and playful way that he conducts a ceremony. it really is beautiful. and no matter whether i can get back to Peru or not in this lifetime, I'll have fond memories of that man and his icaros with me forever. The centre itself is also something to behold, a little more off the beaten path than most, it resides it virgin jungle and the scenery around the tambos is breathtaking and a perfect compliment to the healing process. Your shower consists of running spring water contained in a stream that had been built to go past all of the tambos, using this living water to bathe in daily invigorates the body and soul, and further helps you connect with the beauty around you. The Maloka is amazing, and the food is light, healthy and fantastic (i comfortably lost about 8kg in my 3 week stay). The centre also offers unique options in the way of isolation diets using sanango plants, and ajo sacha diets all of which are harvested right on the property. I myself completed a Chiric Sanango dieta, which was the toughest and most rewarding mission i've ever undertaken in my life. I implore whoever reads this to do the same if you read the outlines of the diet and believe that you're up to it...\nSo to save myself going on about the place for hours i'll just cut it short here and beg you to do yourself and everyone that you hold close in your life a favour, come to this place, and go back home the human being that you've always known you could be. You'll reach your human potential here i can tell you that much for sure\nRyan (Osito) from Australia :)\n\nRainforest Healing Center is absolutely GORGEOUS! There are Blue Morpho butterflies everywhere! Each Tambo (hut) is very comfortable with large double beds. No laying on a dirty mat for this girl! I slept so well! The food is so FRESH and DELICIOUS! I want to cook like that at home! My ceremonies were intense but MAGICAL! I walked out feeling a new sense of peace and clarity. I looked in the mirror and my eyes were clearer and I was glowing from within!\nI highly recommend this center for Sanango Isolation Diets, a few fellow guests raved about them... We made our own Ayahuasca from the property and we replanted some too! I couldn't have asked for a better experience.\nThank you Omar and friends! I will be back!!!\n\nChakra Allegria de Amor is a great retreat to have your healing. I was looking to do an isolation diet and it ticked all the boxes. Its got a perfect balance of comfort to closeness to the jungle. For example it does not have a nice pool, which no-one really needs, but each tambo has its own private stream to have a shower in. All tambos are isolated and you have to walk a 100 yards at least to get to one. Omar and Pedro do things as they should be done. Don't expect spiritual tourism, expect proper healing.\nI was unsure about the place originally, but I met Omar in person in Iquitos and he suggested I go to the retreat that night, see everything for myself and then decide and pay if I am convinced.\nI ended up doing uchu sanango diet, probably one of the hardest ones. And Pedro looked after me for all these 8 days. I was unsure about Pedro at first but towards the end I realised that he is what a true healer should be -- tough enough to fight the condition you have, but empathetic enough to provide the required support.\nThe final ceremony was amazing. The medicine did not seem to work at all up until I thought the ceremony has ended. I thought Pedro fell asleep and that would be it. But in the end I have had the most powerful purge of my life and then I realised that Pedro was actually expecting it. He was visibly uplifted by what has happened and proud that the healing was complete. So don't expect him to give up on you until you get what you came here for!\n\nThe Rainforest Healing Center is operated with such commitment to the land, the medicine, the animals and plants that inhabit it and the way in which medicine is offered. All of the lodging are beautifully constructed and the lay out shows so much presence and dedication to a place like no other. I could tell you my story of being there and the wonderful people I met there but each person writes there own story and it is best to just say that this center is small and selective.\nI looked for months for a center that felt like it held the energy I was looking for. I did not want to be in a club med jungle, I wanted to be in a respected well stewarded rainforest retreat taking baths in real water, rainforest water and melting into the myriad sounds and experiences of what is rapidly disappearing from the area and the world. Hope to go back soon. I spent a total of 21 days there in October of 2014. I loved all of the people I met there and that the medicine actually grew on the land. Beautiful.\n\nI travelled to the Rainforest Healing Center last year, seeking healing from a broken relationship, and found all that I was looking for and much more. This center is non profit, and run for the right reasons - to facilitate healing, with love and compassion. It is built into the rainforest, with great respect for the rainforest and the environment, and with emphasis on sustainability. The medicine is grown and harvested on site, and they replant more than they use.\nI worked with Pedro and Luisa whilst I stayed there, and they are everything I had hoped for, genuine healers with love in their hearts. The ceremonies are taken very seriously with safety and protection a priority. I have heard many horror stories about bad shaman, and poorly run retreats, and I can safely say from my experiences there that this is a safe and genuine place, and I would recommend it to anyone. This center is the real deal, not built for Ayahuasca tourists, but for those looking to really work with themselves and the medicine. It is completely off the grid, and as such is a very authentic experience, allowing us to get back in touch with nature, and ourselves.\nHighly recommended, with love! I will certainly be returning!\n\nThank you!\n\nWhy Retreat?\n\nWe asked people why they go on retreat, here's what they said:\n\nTo give my ego a break from all these construction projects.\nLayth\n\nRetreat Guru's Vision\n\nWe believe human beings are innately wise, strong and kind. This wisdom, although not always experienced, is always present. Going on retreat is a beautiful way to reconnect to our basic sanity and health. Our aspiration at Retreat Guru is to inspire people to experience authentic retreats and reconnect with their innate wisdom, strength and kindness."
