    "text": "Media creativity in the aftermath of the 28 June coup against Honduran President Mel Zelaya has generally been limited to such things as CNN\u2019s classification of the military coup as \u201cmilitary-led,\u201d Honduran media classification of tomorrow\u2019s illegitimate elections as a \u201cfiesta c\u00edvica,\u201d and the publication of articles in mainstream Honduran newspapers with titles like \u201cZelayista Guerrillas Train in Nicaragua.\u201d This particular article, published by El Heraldo on 2 August, is accompanied by a photograph of a ragtag group of joggers\u2014some of them barefoot, one in a cowboy hat, and one in all pink\u2014and bears a caption announcing that \u201cManuel Zelaya\u2019s followers have begun military exercises in fields in Nicaragua.\u201d\n\nMore substantive creative endeavors have been undertaken by Dan Archer and Nikil Saval, who have put together a graphic history of the Honduran coup in two parts thus far. The latter part is based on Joseph Shansky\u2019s piece \u201cSmashing the Silence: Community Defiance in Honduras,\u201d first published on PULSE, and can be viewed below (note: all annotations appear in the original version). The first part of the graphic history can additionally be viewed here, and information on other projects can be found on Archer\u2019s website.\n\nPanel 1 \u2013 Image in the background is from the Honduras Resists blog. Panel 2 \u2013 For evidence, see a recent poll by Washington-based Greenberg Quinlan Rosner, which showed public support for deposed President Zelaya was still strong.\n\nPanel 1 \u2013 The \u2018historic accord\u2019 quote from the previous panel is from Hillary Clinton, and the speech balloon quote in this panel is taken from here.\n\nPanels 1, 3 \u2013 Direct quotes from Micheletti, via CNN. Panel 4 \u2013 CAFTA stands for the \u201cThe United States-Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement\u201d \u2013 based on the same failed neoliberal NAFTA model which promotes privatization and deregulation of key public services. This may explain Senator DeMint\u2019s dislike for Zelaya. Direct quote from Senator DeMint, via Bloomberg News. Panel 6 \u2013 Another direct quote from Demint, from his website.\n\nPanel 1 \u2013 Direct quote, translated from the Spanish. Panel 2 \u2013 Read more. Panel 3 \u2013 Statement from DeMint\u2019s website. Panel 3 \u2013 Henry Kissinger, Secretary of State under Richard Nixon, about Chile prior to the CIA overthrow of the democratically elected government of socialist President Salvador Allende in 1973."
