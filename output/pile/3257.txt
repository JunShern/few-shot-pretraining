Though transforming your business into an environmentally friendly one may not be an easy task, the benefits of doing so are long lasting for the environment, the consumer, and even businesses themselves.\n\nWhat Does It Mean to be An Environmentally Friendly Business?\n\nBeing environmentally friendly in business means that your business makes a conscious effort to reduce its negative impact on the environment. This effort can take form in anything from implementing a green office program to working with your business\u2019s manufacturers and suppliers to reduce the use of non-renewable resources.\n\nBenefits of Going Green\n\nThere are many benefits to a business making the conscious effort to go green:\n\nIt Can Save You Money \u2013 reducing your energy, paper usage, and reusing office supplies where you can, will inevitably reduce overall costs which can then be put into other important facets of a business.\n\nBuilds Consumer Loyalty \u2013 Many studies have found that consumers believe green businesses to be more trustworthy than non-green ones. Moreover, by making a concentrated effort to reduce the negative environmental impact your business has can promote a sense of community between your business and the consumer.\n\nHelps Attract and Retain Employees \u2013 Going green has also been proven to promote positive feelings within employees. Knowing that a business cares about the impact they make on their community boosts employee morale and can attract potential employees who want to feel that they are making a positive difference.\n\nImproves the Longevity of Your Business \u2013 When your business is less dependent on non-renewable resources (i.e. resources that can become depleted in the future), you ensure the longevity and sustainability of your business in the future.\n\nWhat Can Businesses Do to be Environmentally Friendly?\n\nThe first step to transitioning your business into an environmentally friendly one is to first assess and evaluate your current impact on the environment. This can be done by calculating your business\u2019s carbon footprint. In fact, there are many carbon footprint calculators available online that can be used for free. Once you\u2019re aware of your business\u2019s impact on the environment, you can then figure out which areas of your business are the most impactful.\n\nThough transitioning your business into being ecofriendly may seem overwhelming, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that there are many ways, both big and small, that your business can reduce its negative impact on the environment. Some ways include:\n\nReduce Electricity \u2013 encourage employees to turn off lights and electronics when not in use. This will not only save energy but can cut down on costs as well.\n\nImplementing Monthly Lunch-and-Learns \u2013 Reducing your business\u2019s impact on the environment education involves ensuring that your employees are on board with the changes you are making. Lunch-and-Learns can be a great opportunity to educate employees on the efforts they can make to reduce office resources.\n\nImplement a Green Office Program \u2013 reward programs for employees who show the most effort\n\nReduce Paper Usage Where Possible \u2013 only print necessary documentation and deleting unneeded print jobs are just some of the ways you can reduce paper usage.\n\nReduce Air Travel \u2013 Air travel is one of the biggest culprits of increasing your business\u2019s carbon footprint. Businesses can reduce air travel by holding conference calls online instead of meeting in person.\n\nUse Sustainable & Energy-Efficient Products \u2013 This includes using things such as solar power, energy conserving electronics or rainwater tanks in order to reduce your business\u2019s reliance on non-renewable resources.\n\nIf you\u2019re struggling to find more ways to reduce your carbon footprint, try surveying employees to see if they have any suggestions on ways your business can improve.\n\nOE Canada\u2019s Eco-Friendly Efforts\n\nPlant a Tree Program\n\nAt OE Canada, we believe in the importance of sustainable environmental practices in business. That\u2019s why, in partnership with Tree Canada, we implemented the Plant a Tree Program. With this program, OE Canada promises to plant one tree for every printer sold on behalf of our customers.\n\nHow OE Canada Helps Other Businesses Become Ecofriendly\n\nOE Canada offers several eco-friendly printers so that businesses can have peace-of-mind without sacrificing efficiency. The \u201cEco\u201d Toshiba e-Studio 3508LP Hybrid Multifunction Printing System helps businesses transition into eco-friendly practices by utilizing Toshiba\u2019s hybrid technology which combines conventional printing with erasable printing allowing you to reuse paper over and over again. Black and white printing has never been this green with the world\u2019s first copier/printer with erasable toner!\n\nPaperCut software is also offered at OE Canada as a solution to eliminate waste and encourages employees to print responsibly and take accountability for their printing usage. PaperCut allows employees to delete any print jobs that are no longer required which helps eliminate print waste and saves paper."
