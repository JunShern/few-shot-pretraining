    "text": "Cyber Warfare\n\nPublisher's Summary\n\nIn poll after poll, one of the threats facing our nation is the use of a cyber attack to cause a grid-down scenario. There are many bad actors on the international stage capable of cyber terror on a massive scale. The list is long, including Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, Syria, and now even terrorist groups like ISIS. Each is capable of wreaking havoc in the US by shutting down our power grid and enjoying the resulting chaos.\nNo bombs. No bullets. No swordfights. Just a few keystrokes on a computer. And we're done. Cyber Warfare is a primer on the threats we face as a nation from the bad actors mentioned above. It explores the history of cyber attacks and discusses the nuances of the terminology. The policies of the United States and its allies have evolved over the past decade. The problem of attribution is explored, as cyber space allows hackers a convenient place to hide.\nThe all-important issue is raised:\nWhen does a cyber attack become an act of war?\nAfter a thorough review of the threat a cyber war poses for America, in particular on the nation's critical infrastructure, Cyber Warfare will provide preparedness solutions.\n\nSorry for the Short Delay\n\nUnfortunately, that depends on our systems, and they're keeping it to themselves. It could take a few minutes, but there's a chance it will be longer. We recommend that you check back with us in a few hours, when your title should be available for download in My Library. We appreciate your patience, and we apologise for the inconvenience.\n\nSee More Like This\n\nCustomer Reviews\n\nMost Helpful\n\nStop advertising your site every few chapters!\n\nA few valid point about cyber threats and prepping but I didn't buy the book for general tips on prepping and did not pay for the author to try and subliminally get me to buy from their prepping website!"
