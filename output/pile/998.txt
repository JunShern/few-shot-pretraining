    "text": "REGINA\u2014First Nations leaders say they\u2019ll be able to do more projects and build more homes because of changes that give them more control over financial resources.\n\nThe federal government announced Tuesday that First Nations will now be able to carry funding from year-to-year, instead of having to return money if a project wasn\u2019t completed within a fiscal year.\n\nAssembly of First Nations Chief Perry Bellegarde said the problem was that projects often didn\u2019t get approved until late in a fiscal year.\n\n\u201cThere used to always be the requirement, but you know the monies never got out fast enough and everybody would panic that you have resources that have to be expended by the end of March or you lose them or you have to send them back,\u201d Bellegarde said after making the announcement at the AFN\u2019s annual meeting.\n\n\u201cThe monies coming out for housing came out so late, you can\u2019t finish your housing programs, so now you\u2019re going to be able to carry them over to the next fiscal year so that work can continue.\u201d\n\nBellegarde called the old situation \u201cMarch madness,\u201d but said communities won\u2019t have to scramble now.\n\nRead more:\n\nActivists celebrate as statue of controversial Halifax founder covered with tarp\n\nCanadian military must learn more about Indigenous history to avoid incidents like the one on Canada Day: Mi\u2019kmaq organizer\n\nCanada\u2019s top general apologizes for incident at Indigenous ceremony\n\nIndigenous and Northern Affairs Minister Carolyn Bennett said the old process left communities in a situation where projects could be caught in a cycle of starting and stopping.\n\n\u201cThey can start the project and then know that if it\u2019s not done by the following spring, that they still have the money to carry on and finish the project,\u201d said Bennett, who also addressed the AFN on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question these are first steps, but these were real irritants that we can get out of the way.\u201d\n\nOttawa will also work with First Nations on a new approach to funding essential services, such as fire, emergency services, schools, and water and waste treatment systems, she said.\n\nBoth the government and the AFN said the current policy, which was introduced almost 20 years ago, is outdated, and does not reflect First Nations needs.\n\n\u201cThe requirement to find other sources of funding to ensure that you have clean drinking water or emergency management services, it means that some communities go without these essential services,\u201d said Bellegarde.\n\n\u201cThis policy ... does real harm and it\u2019s holding First Nations back.\u201d\n\nLoading... Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading...\n\nEarlier in the day, Bellegarde opened the Assembly of First Nations\u2019 annual meeting with an impassioned plea to end racism.\n\nHe said First Nations face alarming acts of hatred and violence and it must stop.\n\n\u201cEvery child has a right to a safe and healthy home and to grow up in a society where they are treated with dignity and respect and have the same opportunities as other children,\u201d Bellegarde told the assembly in Regina Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe violence, the racism, the discrimination has to end.\u201d\n\nFederal Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould said she shares his concerns.\n\n\u201cWe need to ensure that we do everything that we can to address those realities,\u201d said Wilson-Raybould, who was at the AFN meeting. \u201cWe all need to understand the history and the realities of Indigenous peoples in this country.\u201d\n\nBellegarde cited the hateful reaction to murder charges against a white Saskatchewan farmer in the death of an Indigenous man named Colton Boushie.\n\nBoushie, 22, of the Red Pheasant First Nation, was shot and killed while riding in an SUV that went onto a farm last August.\n\nBellegarde spoke of the counter protests to First Nations seeking the removal of a statue in Halifax of Edward Cornwallis, who founded that city in 1749 and soon after issued a bounty on Mi\u2019kmaq scalps.\n\nOn Canada Day, a group of off-duty Canadian military men disrupted a spiritual event at the statue marking the suffering of Indigenous peoples.\n\nThe men, who now face a military investigation and possible expulsion from the Forces, said they were members of the Proud Boys, a self-declared group of \u201cwestern chauvinists\u201d who have said they are tired of apologizing for \u201ccreating the modern world.\u201d\n\nBellegarde also referenced recent deaths in Thunder Bay, Ont., that has struggled with tensions between local police and Indigenous people."
