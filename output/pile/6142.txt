I bought the car in 2014 and never took the time to learn much about what I had. I was hoping someone could help me figure out what has been done to my engine. To my knowledge the motor and computer is from an '83 zx turbo. Also I told by another user that my valve cover breather hose is causing a major vaccum leak. What should I do?\nThis album is from a previous post, but it has a few good pictures of the engine bay and motor. http://imgur.com/a/4uGkb\n\n(Not sure where to post this) I cross posted this to members projects as well.\nHello,\nWas browsing multiple forums and decided to try out Hybridz for advice. I bought a 1977 280z Frankenstein of a car with an '83 280zx turbo engine swap in 2014 for around five grand. I drove it around for a year or so and it died on me after removing the previous owners sound system. Life got in the way and the car had a parasitic draw and sat for around 15 months. I just brought it to a shop and had the fuel system flushed with new filters, however, got robbed on the price in my opinion. I did some general maintenance (oil, spark plugs, coolant) and have been driving it around for the past week. The car is far from stock and I was hoping some of you guys could help me by identifying what I have. Any help is much appreciated! Below is a numbered imgur album. Sorry it is alot of pictures. My knowledge is weak and I know I need to find a service manual, but I don't know where to start. Its pretty fast when the turbo kicks in, I believe its running around 12 pounds of boost if the gauge is accurate. Definitely kicks your head back.\nhttp://imgur.com/a/4uGkb\n\n(Not sure where to post this) I cross posted this to members projects as well.\nHello,\nWas browsing multiple forums and decided to try out Hybridz for advice.

And with the rb25 n/a what would be some good stuff to pull some extra horse power out ofthe motor i would like to be right around the 300hp to the wheels?\n\nHey guys. I am going to apologize immediately because it has been a while since I posted anything on a forum, and I know all of these sites have different procedures and rules as far as posting goes.\nI am purchasing a 1972 240z from one of my customers (I am a car salesman and he asked me if I wanted to buy a car while his wife was signing paperwork). He is the original owner. The car has just over 50k miles on it. The entire car has been race prepped to run in SCCA races. The engine was built by Bob Sharp and it has a lot of first gen performance parts on it. The car has been stored in a heated garage since it was purchased, but just like every car from this time period it has some cancer in the metal. The good news is that I was a sheet metal welder, so replacing the sheet metal doesn't worry me.\nOn to my first question. The car has not run since 1991, and the current owner told me that I should check with some knowledgeable people (aka you guys) on what steps I should take to turn over the motor. He knows his stuff when it comes to working on the car because he did most of the work on the car back in the day, but he also said that I should start doing my own research in order to get myself more oriented with the whole restoration process. He did mention something about taking out the spark plugs and pouring some penetrating oil in to loosen up the engine in case it was stuck. So, what steps should I take to turn this baby over?\nThanks in advance!\n\nHello i am new to this forum so i am not sure im doing this right but. i recently bought a ms2 DIY kit from diyautotune and all was going well until i was instructed to download the firmware. I got the firmware and downloader from msextra, i run the program and i get a message (in picture). i have checked my power multiple times and the megasquirt has passed all the previous tests using the db9 adaptor from diyautune and the stimulator. i have researched everything and can not find any information on how to get the firmware downloaded with this problem. Ive been struggling with this for a total of 7 hours by now and i just want it to work. ive tried everything. HELP ME!!!!! lol.\n\nI generally keep my car in the garage in the winter. So far, it has only had the occasional struggle starting when left out in the cold. However, this last weekend it was down to -37C, and I was over at a friend's place now it's Tuesday, -10C, and it still wont start (cranks but no firing at all).\nI have heated it well beyond what it should need to start (using several devices). with no luck. I have found the following, the pump still works, there is spark, it cranks just fine, and it won't start even when jumped. It runs and starts just fine above +5C (with no external heater).\nThere is a possibility the fuel lines have frozen but that seems unlikely, and I have no way to test compression, but I hear that is another possibility.\nDoes anyone have ideas or suggestions?\n\nHi all I would like a quick run down of the wiring schematic or any kind of help to get this 1jz started outside of the car.\nCame with all wiring stock from factory as well as ECU.\nECU has four plugs and is a jzx100 motor. Etcs\nWhat wires do I need to hook up to get this baby to run\n\nHello, I am new to this forum. So far, I have found the search function doesn't work as well as some other forums I am on. So if this topic has been beaten to death I apologize, but I did look (both on here and through google). As many posts here have acknowledged, the stock alternators on the S30 leave much to be desired (particularly at idle). I found sites discussing swapping to smaller diameter pulleys, but only in a generic sense. Therefore, I don't know what the alternator on a 1975 280z can handle ...or if it would even help. Has anyone tried putting a smaller pulley in to increase the idle alternator RPM? What are your thoughts and what size might you suggest? Obviously, it will wear faster and I don't want to over spin it. On the note of wear, what do you think of swapping for a clutched pulley while I am at it? If no one answers, I will just try swapping in a internally regulated 70-Amp alternator from a 1986 300zx.\n\nHello everyone! I hope you are all having a pleasant day.\nI recently bought a 1970 240z after saving money for a long time. I was excited and said that it will be easy, that I am gonna build it within the next few months. I was naive and after reading a certain post on this website, i was \"enlightened\".\n\"For the newbie car guys on this forum.. New to building Z cars and etc..\" Is the post I read.\nI now want to take my time to enjoy building the car and learn as much as i can through this \"journey\". I would like to mention that there is no budget concerning this project since I think it will last a life time\nHere I am now to ask all of you who have experienced building a Z.\nI ask you for all the advice you can give me and to answer any question listed below if you please. If you think there is a link that will answer or help me in anyway, go ahead and add it.\n1. What would you recommend to have in a garage in order to modify a car in general? I am new to this so please list everything you deem necessary\n2. What are the reasons you chose a certain engine? The Z i bought has an rb25de neo and I wondering about the positives and negatives about the engines (2JZ, SR20DET, RB26DETT, etc)\n3. For a newbie like me, what would you recommend I do in order to gain more experience?\n4. Where do I begin?\n5. Which differential do you use and why?\nThis is my first time posting so I do apologize for any grammer/spelling mistakes as English is not my first language. I also do not know what information am I missing in this post so, if there is anything you would like to know about me or the Z, please ask away!\nRegards!\n\nHey guys,\nI have owned this car since high school (1999). I have always wanted to fix it up and have it as a weekend cruiser, however I never had the money.....until now! I am in the Richmond, VA area but I am willing to tow this car to DC/Baltimore/MD area or NC area. I am looking for somebody to help me restore this car. It has been sitting for awhile and needs to be gone through to get it back running again. If anybody can point me in the right direction please let me know. I want to get this car running again, I need help with engine/turbo/fuel/electrical etc, but I will handle the body/paint/cosmetic side (unless feasible in area).\nThanks,\nAndrew\n\nHello everyone, i had a question regarding the sr20det swap into the s30 chassis more specifically a 280z. What needs to be done so that the egnine can get enough fuel for about 250-300 crank horsepower reiably? Getting a fuel cell isnt really an option since i plan to daily this car in the future. I was just curious what everyone else was using in terms of fueling in their ka/sr swaps.\n\nI have a 260z thats wiring wise all stock. My fuel, clock and tach(sometimes) gauges all work. My voltage is stuck somewhere in negative so I'm not sure if thats electrical issues involving alternator but i don't mind that one not working. My oil and water gauge does not work. I have a newly bought oil sender, the bullet type water temp sender(is this the sender) with single bullet connector connected but the sensor next to it with two wires coming out isn't connected because they were cut completely off.\nI took off gauge and put battery + terminal to ign(G) and the black wire to ground. i then grounded my oil wire(Y/B) and it only moves to the 0 position. i thought it was supposed to move all the way? Is the gauge bad?\nAny help is appreciated as i really can't afford one right now and don't want to run my car without either of these gauges.\nAlso how can i tell if my water pump is working? I have no leaks but i feel the engine gets very hot very quickly. I took the radiator cap off and i thought bubbles would come out or you would see the coolant flowing or moving but it was very still. I'm afraid thats also bad.\n\nhey guys I currently have a stock 76 280Z and i was wondering if it would be possible to get 16x9 with a 15 offset on without the use of flares ( not a huge fan of flares ) im pretty sure i would need to get my fender rolled but i still need some more knowledge on this. If i could fit them what about tire sizes and etc ?\nAlso i may lower the car with eibach springs in the next couple of months will i still be good without the flares then ? thank you for any help\n\nOk, So I need some help with wiring.\nI am swaping a 1981 l28et into a 1976 280z\nI recently just found out that the wiring harness and ECU that I have is from an 1982; after checking the serial # on the computer and noticing that the wiring harness did not have a hook up for the dropping resistors. I have been having difficulty understanding the wiring diagrams for both the 1981/2 harness and the 1976 harness. I have been using the Bumble Z ( wiring torutrial as a reference but I am still confused. Most of what I have figured out is quite simple: the injectors, CAS, other sensors, but thats about it.\nProblems\n1. The Coil and Ignitor\nThis is my original coil. What can I remove from this harness what should I keep?\nThis is my \"new\" coil I do not have the part of the harness that plugs into it but I have firgured out a way to make a plug for it I just need to know what goes to what. The pins on the ignitor are shaped like a T (a Black w/ whit wire and a Blue wire run to the ignitor from the coil) I cant figure what I should wire to this But I am pretty sure it has to do with the computers spark control.\n2. Fuseable Links\nI have both fuseable links right now for the old engine and the \"new\" In this picture I have them mounted next to each other.\nI understand from the Bumble Z tutorial the only wires I need are the green a brown wire on the \"new\" harness. I am a little uneasy about removing or cutting any of the wires that lead to the existing fusable links. (Do I need this to run my lights or fuel pump?)\n3. Ignition Harness\nThis was pluged into what I belive is the ignition harness of the \"new\" ECU and the back end of this plug should somehow run to the ignitor/coil. In the bumble z tutorial he had a 6 prong plug, his one has 8.\n4. Switched Power\nIn the tutorial there are a lot of things that need to be run to switched power what should I use? I think I have firgured out that the black w/ white wire that runs to the coil should be switched power but im not really sure.\nI will really apreciate some input please dont tell me to search more, maybe at least point me in the right direction. I live in the Seattle area but my car is in lakewood (hour south of seattle). If there are any wiring gurus that can help me I would more than greatfull. Also I am a college student at Seattle University studying photography. i am willing to trade som automotive photography services for help with the wirring.\nSide Note: I am really losing morale I already have had one of the turbo engines I was working on stolen that I bought for $1000, wich is a lot of money to a college student.\nThanks for all the help!!!\n\nSo yesterday, my car was totaled.\nI was at a red light at the bottom of a bridge, and on the left lane there was a guy who was pushing his car because he was having car problems. 30 seconds into waiting for the red light to turn green, I looked into my rearview, I saw a Honda coming at me at least 45 mph. I saw him 2 seconds before he hit me, so I braced for impact. He pushed me to the other side of the intersection. I tried to exit the car but the feders trapped the door, so I climbed out the window. I went up to the driver and asked what happened with him and told him off for being reckless. He told me that he was distracted by the guy pushing his car because he wanted to help him out. So I called insurance and cops took a report.\nToday the adjuster came and said the car is a total loss. He said they'll get back to me within a few days with an offer.\nI've put a lot of time and money restoring this car, but I have a feeling they will try to lowball me. Has anyone had a similar experience? How much were you compensated? How can I make sure I get back what I put in?\n\nHey everyone, I own a 1971 240z with a vg30e motor swap that was done by a previous owner.\nI'm looking for more power and have read up quite a bit on the nA to turbo conversions. I have found a 1985 300zx turbo donor car and I'd like to do the conversion. I'm no mechanic so i do need help.\nDoes anyone have any shop or mechanic recommendations for this type of work?\n\nim new to this. so i pulled my stock vg30 out and have been in the process of a v8 swap. i have the v8 all built heads cam carb but im having a problem i have been trying to mock up the motor location so i can built my motor mounts and the damn oil pan is hitting the rack n pinion. anyone have this problem or know what kind of oil pan i should switch to any help would be great thank you\n\nHey, I havn't hardly posted on here, cause I really couldnt find reason too. Everything I was looking for was already on here asked by 300 other people lol. I seen the last few days yall been having trouble with the website, I'm glad its back up cause seriously this is my #1 source for info on my 280Z. Since I bought it a few years back I've finally got the efi to work and get the car up to where I can enjoy it. The motor is coming out near the end of the season and gonna put some flat tops and megasquirt. I seriously cannot wait to do all this. I just wanted to let everyone here on this forum that posts their fixes, problems, and issues THANK YOU! You've helped me tons and on a limited budget! Not to mention great reading about some of your guys and gals cars in here. Tommorrow the cars gonna get flogged on some north ga mountain roads near my house all thanks to you guys.\n\nI bought a 1977 280Z off my neighbor for $400 garage kept for 20 years when he stopped driving it due to him becoming handicapped. Been driving it for a while, but I do want to do an engine swap on it. I hear alot about these LS1, LS2, LS6's being good also pretty easy being that holley makes kits for them. My friend told me to put an engine from a 90-95 300zx either single turbo, twin turbo, or non turbo. He also suggested a turbo 3000cc or an F20c. I guess what i'm asking is for the more senior car men to give me suggestions on what I will give me the most bang for my buck. Im open to all suggestions of other engines.\n\nWell Guys,\nFirst of all Hi! I'm new to the forum,\nI purchase a 240z about a month now & I started dismantling the car\n(IS A PROJECT)...\nso the old owner made a swap already, to a turbo of a newer version,\nbut I'm not sure about the exact model or year of this engine\nI will guess is a 280zx engine because is turbo, but not sure about it...\nplease check this photo...\nI'm not sure if keep this engine or make an RB25dett swap from a GTS Skyline\nPlease need some urgent help of what should I do\nhow many hp this engine gives and what about the RB\nThank You All"
