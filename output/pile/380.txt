R. 36-3. The panel finds that a published opinion\nmight cast unjust aspersions upon those not before the court.\n\fissue had a substantial and injurious effect or influence on the verdict, we reverse\n\nand remand. See Pulido v. Chrones, 629 F.3d 1007, 1012 (9th Cir. 2010).\n\n                          FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n\n      On January 20, 1998, Stephanie Crowe, aged twelve, was stabbed nine times\n\nby knife in her own bed in her own bedroom. She had been on the phone about 10\n\np.m. and died before midnight. Her body was discovered by her grandmother\n\nabout 6 a.m., the next day.\n\n      Within two weeks of her death, the Escondido police had identified three\n\nteenage boys as suspects, had interrogated them, and had obtained confessions. On\n\nMay 22, 1998, these suspects were indicted for Stephanie\u2019s murder. The district\n\nattorney of San Diego County prepared the case for trial, calling on an F.B.I.\n\nexpert, Mary Ellen O\u2019Toole, for help in developing the case. But in February\n\n1999, the state Attorney General dismissed the indictments without prejudice. This\n\ncourt recently reversed the dismissal of a \u00a7 1983 lawsuit brought by the former\n\nsuspects against the investigating police officers, so that case is going forward. See\n\nCrowe v. County of San Diego, 608 F.3d 406 (9th Cir. 2010).\n\n      Here, however, we consider only the record as it developed in Tuite\u2019s\n\ncriminal trial. That record shows that the day after Stephanie\u2019s death, the police\n\npicked up Tuite, an itinerant known to have been as close as one quarter of a mile\n\n\n                                          2\n\fto the Crowe house at one point on the fatal evening. They took hair samples and\n\nfingernail scrapings, photographed him and impounded some of his clothes, in\n\nparticular a red turtleneck shirt and a white T-shirt. These items were examined on\n\nApril 28, 1998 for bloodstains. Wetting the red shirt completely and using a\n\nfluoroscopic process, the police found no blood on the red shirt. The red shirt was\n\nsubsequently photographed using a tripod that had previously been used at the\n\nscene of the crime without using protective coverings for the legs so as to avoid\n\ncontamination. The white T-shirt had visible bloodstains and was sent to a\n\nlaboratory for DNA testing. The test excluded Stephanie as the donor. Search of\n\nthe Crowe house found no physical evidence of Tuite ever having been there.\n\n      Tuite was a mentally deficient person, without known employment or home,\n\nwho had been living in the San Diego area. On the evening of January 20, he had\n\nbothered three residences as he sought \u201cthe girl\u201d or \u201cTracy.\u201d After Stephanie\u2019s\n\ndeath, he continued this quest during the rest of January, February and March\n\n1998. Sometimes he annoyed residents enough that they called the police. On no\n\noccasion was he violent or did he use a weapon.\n\n      The San Diego District Attorney recused himself. The state Attorney\n\nGeneral took over the case. In May 2002, the Attorney General obtained the\n\nindictment of Tuite for murder in the first degree.\n\n\n                                          3\n\f      At trial, the state presented evidence that a criminologist in 1999 had\n\nretested the red shirt worn by Tuite and found Stephanie\u2019s DNA in a stain on it; in\n\nApril 2003, a second criminologist had retested Tuite\u2019s white T-shirt and found her\n\nDNA on it. The defense countered these reports with expert testimony that the\n\npolice could have inadvertently contaminated the shirts while they were in their\n\ncustody as they investigated the case. O\u2019Toole, the F.B.I. expert first retained by\n\nthe district attorney to prosecute the boys, testified for the defense that in her\n\njudgment \u201cthe crime scene\u201d reflected organization, that is, control of the victim and\n\nof surrounding events and circumstances so that the murder could be brought off\n\nwithout alarming the family members sleeping nearby, and without the murderer\n\nleaving fingerprints or the murder weapon. The prosecution rebutted O\u2019Toole with\n\nits last witness, Gregg O. McCrary, who had been an agent of the F.B.I. for nearly\n\nthirty years, and was now in the business of consulting on criminal behavior. He\n\ntestified that the crime scene was, on the whole, \u201cdisorganized,\u201d reflecting a\n\nrandom attack.\n\n      The defense moved to impeach McCrary by cross-examining him on a letter\n\nhe had written, attacking O\u2019Toole\u2019s analysis of the crime scene, accusing her of\n\nundermining the prosecution of this case, suggesting that she had acted unethically,\n\nand expressing a strong desire that O\u2019Toole be persuaded not to testify at Tuite\u2019s\n\n\n                                            4\n\ftrial. After a hearing outside the presence of the jury, the court excluded the letter\n\nand cross-examination based on the letter.\n\n      McCrary\u2019s excluded letter, dated February 24, 2004, was written to the\n\nInternational Criminal Investigative Analysis Fellowship (ICIAF) about O\u2019Toole\u2019s\n\nproposed testimony for the defense, and what he termed \u201cethical issue[s]\u201d that\n\ntestimony raised. He wrote that Tuite was the \u201ctrue killer,\u201d and that he was hopeful\n\nO\u2019Toole would not testify. He went on:\n\n      Neither the San Diego County Sheriff\u2019s Office nor the Office of the\n      Attorney General for the State of California has requested the\n      assistance of the NCAVC [National Center for the Analysis of Violent\n      Crime] or the ICIAF in this matter. Both agencies are shocked and\n      dismayed that Mary Ellen O\u2019Toole, a representative of both the FBI\n      and [the] ICIAF, has injected herself into this case in what they view\n      as an attempt to obstruct justice and undermine the successful\n      prosecution of Richard Tuite.\n\n(emphasis added). At the hearing, McCrary admitted that he had not spoken to\n\nanyone from the Sheriff\u2019s Office. He also admitted that no one had accused\n\nO\u2019Toole of obstructing justice or undermining Tuite\u2019s prosecution.\n\n      A jury found Tuite guilty of manslaughter. The court sentenced him to\n\nthirteen years imprisonment. He appealed to the California Court of Appeal for the\n\nFourth District, which found that the trial court had committed constitutional error\n\nin excluding McCrary\u2019s letter and cross-examination on it, but held the error to be\n\n\n\n                                           5\n\fharmless and affirmed. The Supreme Court of California denied review. The\n\nfederal district court denied Tuite\u2019s petition for habeas.\n\n      Tuite\u2019s appeal to us focuses on the California\u2019s court\u2019s ruling of\n\nharmlessness. That court held:\n\n             Under the above-stated legal principles, we agree Tuite\u2019s\n      counsel should have been allowed to cross-examine McCrary about\n      his February 24, 2004 letter, and the trial court violated Tuite\u2019s\n      constitutional right to confront adverse witnesses when it precluded\n      such cross-examination.\n\n          The letter was relevant because it demonstrated bias and impacted\n      McCrary\u2019s credibility in a manner that could lead a reasonable jury to\n      question the reliability and validity of his testimony. (See Evid. Code,\n      \u00a7\u00a7 210, 780, subd. (f).) The letter bore directly on McCrary\u2019s\n      credibility and reliability by indicating McCrary had a personal\n      interest in convicting Tuite, whom he referred to as \u201cthe true killer.\u201d\n      The letter also demonstrated McCrary had prejudged Tuite\u2019s case and\n      was acting more as an advocate for the prosecution than as a forensic\n      expert. Moreover, McCrary\u2019s unusual attempt to dissuade O\u2019Toole\n      from testifying revealed a bias in favor of the prosecution and a bias\n      against O\u2019Toole. The letter also revealed McCrary\u2019s tendency to\n      exaggerate; his statement that the sheriff\u2019s office and the prosecuting\n      agency viewed O\u2019Toole as obstructing justice was not only a gross\n      overstatement but was also unreliable because no one from the\n      sheriff\u2019s office had talked to him about O\u2019Toole\u2019s upcoming\n      testimony. For all these reasons, it is likely that a reasonable jury\n      would have received \u201ca significantly different impression of [the\n      witness\u2019s] credibility had [the excluded cross-examination] been\n      permitted.\u201d (Delaware v. Van Arsdall, supra, 475 U.S. at p. 680).\n\nNonetheless, the court of appeal held this constitutional error to be harmless\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n\n                                           6\n\f      The court of appeal weighed the harm of the constitutional error. It held that\n\nthe jury itself was informed of the elements making up \u201cthe crime scene\u201d; the jury\n\nwas not dependent on the experts in determining whether the crime scene was\n\norganized or disorganized. The court of appeal added: \u201cFurther, the error in\n\nexcluding McCrary\u2019s letter had no impact on the central evidence against Tuite \u2013\n\nthe DNA evidence that Tuite had Stephanie\u2019s blood on his clothing.\u201d\n\n      In assessing the harmlessness of the constitutional error, however, the court\n\nof appeal left out of the account these considerations: (1) the improbability of the\n\nprosecution\u2019s case \u2013 namely, that a stranger could enter a house he did not know\n\nwithout leaving any signs of forced entry, make his way to a bedroom occupied by\n\na girl without being seen or heard by the five other family members in the house,\n\nbe moved to kill a girl he did not know, and depart from the house leaving no trace\n\nof any kind of his having been there to commit a motiveless murder; (2) the lack of\n\nexplanation regarding how Tuite could have entered or exited the home, given the\n\nfact that the door commonly used to enter and exit the home was found deadbolted\n\nfrom the inside the morning after the murder, and the other doors did not appear to\n\nhave been used to enter or exit the house; (3) the jury\u2019s view of the evidence as\n\nshown by the length of deliberations and the jury\u2019s reported deadlock after a week\n\nof deliberation; (4) the jury\u2019s compromise verdict of voluntary manslaughter rather\n\n\n                                          7\n\fthan murder, reached after another week of deliberation, a verdict virtually\n\nimpossible to square with the evidence of a series of deliberate knife wounds\n\ninflicted on a helpless victim. The court of appeal did note the strength of the\n\nDNA evidence. But if that evidence had been seen as dispositive, the jury would\n\nneither have reported deadlock nor compromised in reaching a manslaughter\n\nverdict in a case in which the victim was stabbed nine times with a knife. In fact,\n\nmembers of the jury could well have regarded the DNA evidence as not entirely\n\npersuasive, given the contradictions between the earlier and later test results and\n\nthe alternative, contamination explanation offered by the defense. No view of the\n\nevidence was advanced by the prosecutor or by the defense that would have\n\njustified mitigating murder, deliberately inflicted on a defenseless child, into a\n\nmanslaughter conviction. Only a deeply-divided jury could have reached a\n\ncompromise agreement of that sort.\n\n      All these factors increase the likelihood that the Confrontation Clause error\n\nwith regard to the expert testimony had a substantial and injurious effect on the\n\nverdict. Moreover, the court ignored the weight that McCrary\u2019s testimony likely\n\ncarried, given its strategic presentation. Coming at the end of a long trial, McCrary\n\nwas presented by the prosecution as an essential rebuttal witness to O\u2019Toole. He\n\nwas her superior in experience and in his past position at the F.B.I. He was a\n\n\n                                           8\n\fgovernment witness no longer in government, speaking with apparent impartiality\n\non his speciality while in government. Absent some reason not to do so, the jury\n\nwould trust his honest evaluation of the scene. To establish that he was jealous and\n\nresentful of O\u2019Toole, that he was seeking to dissuade her from testifying by\n\nsullying her reputation, that he had developed a personal interest in the case, and\n\nthat he was willing to misrepresent the stance of two governmental agencies to\n\nmaintain his position was to destroy the impartial, measured image of him\n\npresented by the prosecution.\n\n      Without that evidence in the record, the prosecution was able to emphasize\n\nthat McCrary was providing his testimony for free, so he had no motive to lie:\n\n              But really interesting, it was fascinating to me, Gregg Mc Crary\n      was criticized by the defense for coming into this courtroom and\n      sharing with you his knowledge, his experience, his expertise and not\n      charging us for it; while at the same time, Dr. Leo comes in and\n      testifies and charges for it and he gets hammered for charging for it.\n      What is it? Which is it? You do it for free, you got to be a creep; if\n      you do it for money, you\u2019re still bad, evil.\n\n             You know, Gregg Mc Crary explained to you when he testified\n      here he does things sometimes pro bono, for no charge, to the extent\n      that he can. He does have to pay for a mortgage and he does have\n      children and a family and obviously expenses. And I would submit to\n      you that Gregg Mc Crary when he testified in this case was\n      completely credible, it was an honor to have him in the courtroom, it\n      was an honor to have him share his knowledge with us, and it was a\n      courageous thing for him to do. He is a lifetime F.B.I. agent.\n\n\n\n                                          9\n\f      Having promoted him to \u201clifetime F.B.I. agent,\u201d the prosecution emphasized\n\nMcCrary\u2019s independence and integrity and lack of personal animus in challenging\n\nO\u2019Toole:\n\n      Why would he be willing to do that? Because he could see how\n      honestly wrong and inaccurate Ms. O\u2019Toole was.\n              It was courageous for him to do that. And for him to be\n      criticized for not charging the prosecution, I feel like calling the\n      Attorney General\u2019s Office, calling Attorney General, or calling the\n      Governor and saying, you know, I know we don\u2019t have that much\n      money, but isn\u2019t it nice we got Mr. Mc Crary to testify and not charge.\n\n      The prosecutor returned to attack O\u2019Toole and to praise McCrary:\n\n             I want to stay on the subject of means for a second. Let\u2019s talk\n      about crime scene assessment. There were two witnesses; the defense\n      called. Mary Ellen O\u2019Toole and we called Gregg Mc Crary.\n\n             And you recall Mr. Mc Crary described to you his experience\n      with the F.B.I. and crime scene assessment, had I would say\n      phenomenal, extensive, international, the number of cases he\u2019s been\n      involved with, the number of crime scene assessments he\u2019s been\n      involved with, and the number of times that he has testified.\n\n            Ms. O\u2019Toole doesn\u2019t have the benefit of that, of that\n      experience. And I would submit to you that it was reflected in the\n      work done and the conclusions drawn.\n\n             If you recall, Gregg Mc Crary said for a crime scene assessment\n      to be done, there are four things that you look at in combination. The\n      four things are: all of the evidence, and we\u2019ll talk about that in a\n      second, victimology, the crime scene location, and suspect evidence.\n\n              And he said something that I did think really kind of stands out;\n      that is, if any one of those is ignored, then the findings become then\n\n\n                                         10\n\f      unreliable. And unfortunately, that is what Ms. O\u2019Toole did. She\n      ignored evidence in the evidence prong, if you will, and she ignored\n      all of the suspect information. As a result, her findings were,\n      honestly, flat-out inaccurate. As we were going through her findings,\n      undoubtedly, as you were seated there, you probably were thinking,\n      well, that is wrong, that is not true. You know organized versus\n      disorganized. When you see the crime scene itself, there is nothing\n      about the crime scene that is organized at all.\n\n            And then luckily, Mr. Mc Crary can describe for you what an\n      organized crime scene is, was actually involved in doing an organized\n      case. It is not reflected in this case whatsoever.\n\n             One of the things that stood out, I think, in Mr. Mc Crary\u2019s\n      testimony is simply the reality of it as he is touching on different\n      factors. And, you know, we asked \u2013 asked him, well, you know, does\n      luck have anything to do with basically in the commission of a crime?\n      Oh yeah, of course it does. And you know in real life it does; good\n      luck, bad luck, always has some \u2013 some play of what is going on. In\n      this case there is a ton of both. Depends on who you are and which\n      way you see it. With regard to, for example, Stephanie, it was all bad\n      luck completely.\n\n      In contrast to the prosecutor\u2019s argument, as the California Court of Appeal\n\nrecognized, \u201c[t]he letter bore directly on McCrary\u2019s credibility and reliability\u201d; it\n\nshowed that \u201cMcCrary had a personal interest in convicting Tuite\u201d; that McCrary\u2019s\n\nown letter showed that he \u201cwas acting more as an advocate for the prosecution than\n\nas a forensic witness.\u201d His own letter \u201ccould lead a reasonable jury to question the\n\nreliability and validity of his testimony.\u201d Moreover, the letter actually contained\n\nunsubstantiated accusations \u2013 that the San Diego Sheriff\u2019s office and the office of\n\n\n\n                                          11\n\fthe Attorney General of California viewed O\u2019Toole as \u201cinjecting herself into this\n\ncase\u201d in \u201can attempt to obstruct justice.\u201d These were accusations made up by\n\nMcCrary without foundation in fact. These accusations revealed a witness with a\n\npassionate animus against O\u2019Toole. Cross examination on the letter would have\n\nsignificantly undermined his credibility to the jury.\n\n      Given the lack of evidence tying Tuite to the crime, the problems with the\n\nDNA evidence, the jury\u2019s deadlock and compromise verdict, and the weight and\n\nstrategic position of McCrary\u2019s testimony, this case is one of those \u201cunusual\u201d\n\ncircumstances in which we find ourselves \u201cin virtual equipose as to the\n\nharmlessness of the error.\u201d O\u2019Neal v. McAninch, 513 U.S. 432, 435 (1995). We\n\nmust treat the error as affecting the verdict, and are compelled to grant the writ. Id.\n\n      The state argues that, instead of or in addition to our analysis under Brecht\n\nconcerning whether the confrontation clause error caused actual prejudice, AEDPA\n\nrequires us to analyze whether the state appellate court's determination was\n\nunreasonable under Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18 (1967), again asking if the\n\nconfrontation clause error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. In other\n\nwords, the state, persistently and passionately, asks us to apply a standard of\n\nreview less favorable to the state than the one we have employed. As the Supreme\n\nCourt has recognized, the Brecht standard \"obviously subsumes\" \"the more liberal\n\n\n                                          12\n\fAEDPA/Chapman standard.\" Fry v. Plyler, 551 U.S. 112, 120 (2007). Therefore,\n\n\"it certainly makes no sense to require formal application of both tests.\" Id. We\n\nnote that -- as Fry predicts -- were we to apply the AEDPA/Chapman standard, we\n\nwould conclude, for the same reasons stated in the text with regard to the Brecht\n\nstandard, that the state court Chapman harmless error ruling was unreasonable.\n\n      For the foregoing reason, the judgment of the district court is REVERSED\n\nand REMANDED with instruction to issue a conditional writ of habeas corpus.\n\n\n\n\n                                         13\n\f                                                                                 FILED\nTuite v. Martel, No. 09-56267                                                    DEC 06 2011\n\n                                                                             MOLLY C. DWYER, CLERK\nCALLAHAN, Circuit Judge, dissenting:                                           U.S. COURT OF APPEALS\n\n\n\n      Tuite is entitled to habeas relief only if the error had a substantial, injurious\n\neffect on the verdict. Slovik v. Yates, 556 F.3d 747, 755 (9th Cir. 2009). Because\n\nthe excluded cross-examination would likely have discredited both the\n\nprosecution\u2019s and defense\u2019s experts, and would have proven relatively unimportant\n\nin light of the other evidence at trial, I would affirm the denial of habeas relief.\n\n      In assessing the effect of the error on the verdict, we assume that the\n\ndamaging potential of the cross-examination would have been fully realized. Id.\n\nAs the state court described, the cross-examination would have revealed\n\nMcCrary\u2019s strong personal bias toward the prosecution and against O\u2019Toole, his\n\nbelief that Tuite was guilty, and his ability to exaggerate.\n\n      However, the potential damage cut both ways. O\u2019Toole\u2019s own credibility\n\nlikely would have been sullied. In a cross-examination outside the jury\u2019s presence,\n\nMcCrary explained that O\u2019Toole\u2019s report of the crime had been \u201cpulled\u201d and that\n\nhe had prepared the letter at someone else\u2019s request for an ethics investigation.\n\nThe jury might also have been influenced by McCrary\u2019s assessment of Tuite\u2019s\n\nguilt, given McCrary\u2019s vast investigative experience.\n\n      Additionally, in assessing the error\u2019s effect we consider (1) the testimony\u2019s\n\n                                           1\n\fimportance; (2) whether it was cumulative; (3) whether there was evidence that\n\ncorroborated or contradicted the testimony\u2019s material points; (4) the extent of\n\ncross-examination allowed; and (5) the full strength of the prosecution\u2019s case. Id.\n\n      1. The dueling testimony was relatively unimportant to both sides, in light\n\nof the other evidence. As Tuite conceded, the DNA evidence was the strongest\n\naspect of the prosecution\u2019s case. The prosecution only used McCrary to rebut\n\nO\u2019Toole\u2019s testimony concerning whether the crime was organized.\n\n      The defense\u2019s case was directed toward establishing that the original\n\nsuspects killed Stephanie. Most important to the defense\u2019s case were the video and\n\naudiotapes of the suspects\u2019 inculpating statements during their interrogations by\n\nthe police.\n\n      In addition to O\u2019Toole\u2019s testimony, the defense put on an expert who\n\ntestified that the nature of the attack suggested more than one attacker. Moreover,\n\nthe defense put on an expert who testified that after 600 hours of investigation, he\n\nhad found nothing placing Tuite inside the house.\n\n      2. Although McCrary\u2019s testimony was not cumulative of other testimony in\n\nfavor of the prosecution, this factor is outweighed by the other factors that all\n\nsuggest the error did not substantially affect the verdict.\n\n      3. The jury could assess for itself whether the extensive crime scene\n\n                                           2\n\fevidence corroborated McCrary\u2019s or O\u2019Toole\u2019s analysis.\n\n      4. Although the defense was prevented from fully exploring McCrary\u2019s bias\n\nbased on the letter, it was able to establish McCrary\u2019s general bias for the\n\nprosecution as a paid witness. Further, defense counsel skillfully challenged\n\nMcCrary\u2019s interpretation of various crime scene factors and his final assessment\n\nthat the crime scene was disorganized.\n\n      5. Despite the improbabilities of the commission of the crime, the\n\nprosecution had a workable theory on how it was done, and showed that Tuite was\n\nbold and irrational in his hunt for a girl on the night of the murder. Tuite had\n\napproached several homes looking for a \u201cgirl,\u201d who he later declared he wanted to\n\n\u201ckill.\u201d Tuite had opened the front door of one of the homes. He was last seen that\n\nnight heading up the road leading to Stephanie\u2019s house, which was the only home\n\non that part of the road. The prosecution showed that he could have entered\n\nthrough the laundry room door and left through one of two different doors.1\n\nFurther, although family members heard pounding in the house around the time of\n\nthe murder, and Stephanie\u2019s mother woke up and realized that her bedroom door\n\nwas opened and shut, none of the family members investigated the noises.\n\n      1\n          Tuite\u2019s ability to slip through the unfamiliar house seems less improbable\nin light of his wily escape from handcuffs and the courtroom holding tank during\ntrial, which ended with his apprehension hours later in another town.\n\n                                          3\n\f      The jury was also presented with evidence placing Tuite in the house.\n\nStephanie\u2019s DNA was found on the shirt Tuite wore that night. Investigators found\n\na wrapper from an uncommon cough drop and a torn Snickers bar wrapper in\n\nTuite\u2019s pockets, and found wrappers from the same cough drops and a torn\n\nSnickers wrapper in Stephanie\u2019s room. Moreover, although the investigators did\n\nnot find a knife on Tuite when he was detained the day after the murder, the jury\n\nreceived evidence that Tuite was found with a knife on three prior occasions.\n\n       The DNA evidence was the strongest aspect of the prosecution\u2019s case,\n\nalthough it was disputed. During its lengthy deliberations, the jury requested read\n\nbacks of DNA testimony, but not the testimony at issue.\n\n      In light of these considerations, I am convinced that the limitation on cross-\n\nexamination did not have a substantial and injurious effect on the jury\u2019s verdict.\n\nThus, I would affirm the denial of habeas relief.\n\n\n\n\n                                          4\n\f"
