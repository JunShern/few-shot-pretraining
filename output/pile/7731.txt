    "text": "Q:\n\nCombination of smartphones' pattern password\n\nHave you ever seen this interface?   \n\nNowadays, it is used for locking smartphones.\nIf you haven't, here is a short video on it.\n\nThe rules for creating a pattern is as follows.\n\nWe must use four nodes or more to make a pattern at least.  \nOnce a node is visited, then the node can't be visited anymore.\nYou can start at any node.\nA pattern has to be connected.\nCycle is not allowed.\n\nHow many distinct patterns are possible?\n\nA:\n\nI believe the answer can be found in OEIS.  You have to add the paths of length $4$ through $9$ on a $3\\times3$ grid, so $80+104+128+112+112+40=576$\nI have validated the $80$, $4$ number paths.  If we number the grid $$\\begin{array}{ccc}1&2&3\\\\4&5&6\\\\7&8&9 \\end{array}$$ \nThe paths starting $12$ are\n$1236, 1254, 1258, 1256$\nand there were $8$ choices of corner/direction, so $32$ paths start at a corner.\nStarting at $2$, there are\n$2145,2147,2369,2365,2541,2547,2587,2589,2563,2569$ for $10$ and there are $4$ edge cells, so $40$ start at an edge.\nStarting at $5$, there are $8$ paths-four choices of first direction and two choices of which way to turn\nAdded per user3123's comment that cycles are allowed:  unfortunately in OEIS there are a huge number of series titled \"Number of n-step walks on square lattice\" and \"Number of walks on square lattice\", and there is no specific definition to tell one from another.  For $4$ steps, it adds $32$ more paths-four squares to go around, four places to start in each square, and two directions to cycle.  So the $4$ step count goes up to $112$.  For longer paths, the increase will be larger.  But there still will not be too many.\n\nA:\n\nI don't have the answer as \"how to mathematically demonstrate the number of combinations\". Still, if that helps, I brute-forced it, and here are the results.\n\n$1$ dot:  $9$\n$2$ dots: $56$\n$3$ dots: $320$\n$4$ dots: $1624$\n$5$ dots: $7152$\n$6$ dots: $26016$\n$7$ dots: $72912$\n$8$ dots: $140704$\n$9$ dots: $140704$\n\nTotal for $4$ to $9$ digits $:389,112$ combinations\n\nA:\n\nWas bored at work and solved it total combinations are 389432 if using 3 or more\n389112 is using 4 or more.\n\n"
