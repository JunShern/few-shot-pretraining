Also now tasked with rebuild\u00ading are Florida\u2019s major util\u00adi\u00adties \u2014 com\u00adpa\u00adnies like Nex\u00adtEra Ener\u00adgy, Inc., Duke Ener\u00adgy and Emera Inc.\n\nThese com\u00adpa\u00adnies face a choice: To dou\u00adble down on a util\u00adi\u00adty mod\u00adel that\u2019s vul\u00adner\u00ada\u00adble to storms and fuel\u00ading more bru\u00adtal ones, or start tran\u00adsi\u00adtion\u00ading to a grid bet\u00adter equipped to han\u00addle hur\u00adri\u00adcanes \u2014 and help keep them from get\u00adting worse. The ques\u00adtion is whether they can be trust\u00aded to choose well.\n\nAs of Fri\u00adday, rough\u00adly 3.8 mil\u00adlion Flori\u00adda res\u00adi\u00addents were with\u00adout pow\u00ader. The state\u2019s util\u00adi\u00adties will have to restore elec\u00adtric\u00adi\u00adty to their cus\u00adtomers while recon\u00adstruct\u00ading vast swaths of the state\u2019s trans\u00admis\u00adsion lines and gen\u00ader\u00adat\u00ading capac\u00adi\u00adty. Flori\u00adda Pow\u00ader & Light Com\u00adpa\u00adny (FPL) \u2014 a Nex\u00adtEra sub\u00adsidiary and the nation\u2019s third-largest pow\u00ader provider\u2014warns that it could take weeks before all of its cus\u00adtomers are able to turn their lights back on. FPL pres\u00adi\u00addent and CEO Eric Silagy called the scale of the out\u00adages \u200b\u201cunprece\u00addent\u00aded,\u201d and one com\u00admu\u00adni\u00adca\u00adtions rep\u00adre\u00adsen\u00adta\u00adtive from the same util\u00adi\u00adty said that what lies ahead \u200b\u201cis going to be a very, very lengthy restora\u00adtion, arguable the longest and most com\u00adplex in U.S. history.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s an oppor\u00adtu\u00adni\u00adty post-Irma to rev\u00ado\u00adlu\u00adtion\u00adize Florida\u2019s pow\u00ader sup\u00adply, but not one that com\u00adpa\u00adnies like FPL are like\u00adly to take advan\u00adtage of. As a recent report from Insid\u00ade\u00adCli\u00admate News found, FPL start\u00aded spon\u00adsor\u00ading research into cli\u00admate change in the ear\u00adly 1970s before even\u00adtu\u00adal\u00adly get\u00adting involved in efforts to sup\u00adpress evi\u00addence of ris\u00ading tem\u00adper\u00ada\u00adtures. The South\u00adern Com\u00adpa\u00adny, which owns Pan\u00adhan\u00addle elec\u00adtric\u00adi\u00adty provider Gulf Pow\u00ader, for decades con\u00adtributed to pub\u00adlic rela\u00adtions cam\u00adpaigns cast\u00ading doubt on the exis\u00adtence of cli\u00admate change, and fun\u00adneled hun\u00addreds of thou\u00adsands of dol\u00adlars into bogus cli\u00admate skep\u00adtic research.\n\nLike their coun\u00adter\u00adparts in oth\u00ader states, Flori\u00adda util\u00adi\u00adties have gone to war with clean ener\u00adgy, too. Last year, they poured a col\u00adlec\u00adtive $21 mil\u00adlion ($8 mil\u00adlion from FPL alone) into an unsuc\u00adcess\u00adful bal\u00adlot mea\u00adsure aimed at stunt\u00ading var\u00adi\u00adous kinds of third-par\u00adty financ\u00ading for solar pow\u00ader. Beyond that effort, investor-owned util\u00adi\u00adties are a force to reck\u00adon with in Flori\u00adda pol\u00adi\u00adtics; the sec\u00adtor employs one lob\u00adby\u00adist for every two state leg\u00adis\u00adla\u00adtors \u2014 the most of any indus\u00adtry. This spring, FPL was found to have writ\u00adten whole sec\u00adtions of anti-solar leg\u00adis\u00adla\u00adtion spon\u00adsored by state rep\u00adre\u00adsen\u00adta\u00adtive Ray Rodriguez, who had pre\u00advi\u00adous\u00adly accept\u00aded $15,000 from the utility.\n\nWith major util\u00adi\u00adties aligned in oppo\u00adsi\u00adtion, the road to renew\u00adables\u2019 pro\u00adlif\u00ader\u00ada\u00adtion in Flori\u00adda may not be an easy one. John Far\u00adrell, direc\u00adtor of the Ener\u00adgy Democ\u00adra\u00adcy Ini\u00adtia\u00adtive at the Insti\u00adtute for Local Self-Reliance, says that poli\u00adcies to tran\u00adsi\u00adtion Florida\u2019s elec\u00adtric\u00adi\u00adty over to renew\u00adables could go a long way toward being able to get lights back on more quick\u00adly after major storms.\n\nIn an ide\u00adal rebuild\u00ading process, Far\u00adrell told In These Times, \u200b\u201cWhat we would see is, from a pol\u00adi\u00adcy stand\u00adpoint, that [util\u00adi\u00adties] would be more sup\u00adport\u00adive of ways cus\u00adtomers could build their own pow\u00ader gen\u00ader\u00ada\u00adtion. In a sys\u00adtem like we have today, if one pow\u00ader line is knocked out, it can affect tens of thou\u00adsands of peo\u00adple \u2026 If we have lots of dif\u00adfer\u00adent pock\u00adets of gen\u00ader\u00ada\u00adtion, we can fig\u00adure out ways to fill in the gaps.\u201d\n\nThe sys\u00adtem Far\u00adrell describe is what\u2019s known as a micro\u00adgrid. The basic idea behind a micro\u00adgrid is to have a bound\u00aded geo\u00adgraph\u00adic area reliant on the same set of pow\u00ader sources that can be oper\u00adat\u00aded inde\u00adpen\u00addent\u00adly of a larg\u00ader elec\u00adtric grid, or \u200b\u201cisland\u00aded,\u201d in ener\u00adgy-wonk par\u00adlance. This allows homes and busi\u00adness\u00ades to share pow\u00ader, mean\u00ading if pow\u00ader gets shut off dur\u00ading a storm, enti\u00adties that get their pow\u00ader from the micro\u00adgrid can keep their lights on.\n\nUnder Flori\u00adda law and that of sev\u00ader\u00adal oth\u00ader states, such a prac\u00adtice is ille\u00adgal, as it would mean under\u00adcut\u00adting util\u00adi\u00adties\u2019 legal\u00adly pro\u00adtect\u00aded monop\u00adoly. The vast major\u00adi\u00adty of solar arrays are cur\u00adrent\u00adly tied to the elec\u00adtric grid by law, mean\u00ading they shut down when the pow\u00ader goes off.\n\nUnsur\u00adpris\u00ading\u00adly, FPL lob\u00adby\u00adists have fought to keep this statute on the books. If util\u00adi\u00adties allowed micro\u00adgrids \u2014 whether ser\u00advic\u00ading large insti\u00adtu\u00adtions or small com\u00admer\u00adcial and res\u00adi\u00adden\u00adtial areas \u2014 they could help main\u00adtain pow\u00ader in a del\u00aduge. Instead, accord\u00ading to FPL pol\u00adi\u00adcy, even ratepay\u00aders with solar pan\u00adels, who could fea\u00adsi\u00adbly keep their lights on dur\u00ading an out\u00adage, are for\u00adbid\u00adden from doing so. \u200b\u201cRenew\u00adable gen\u00ader\u00ada\u00adtor sys\u00adtems con\u00adnect\u00aded to the grid with\u00adout bat\u00adter\u00adies are not a stand\u00adby pow\u00ader source dur\u00ading an FPL out\u00adage,\u201d the utility\u2019s hand\u00adbook states.\n\nThe prob\u00adlem, Far\u00adrell notes, is root\u00aded in FPL and oth\u00ader pri\u00advate elec\u00adtric\u00adi\u00adty providers\u2019 busi\u00adness mod\u00adel. \u200b\u201cThis is true of investor-owned util\u00adi\u00adties in all states like Flori\u00adda, where there are monop\u00ado\u00adlies: Their mon\u00adey for the share\u00adhold\u00aders comes from get\u00adting a rate of return from cap\u00adi\u00adtal they spend, and build\u00ading some\u00adthing like a pow\u00ader plant,\u201d he told me. \u200b\u201cThe util\u00adi\u00adty can build a micro\u00adgrid and make mon\u00adey from it, but that would mean doing some\u00adthing different.\u201d\n\nBeing able to keep pow\u00ader on in the way that micro\u00adgrids allow for could prove espe\u00adcial\u00adly use\u00adful for places like hos\u00adpi\u00adtals and oth\u00ader insti\u00adtu\u00adtions that pro\u00advide essen\u00adtial and ener\u00adgy-depen\u00addent ser\u00advices. It may have even saved lives this past week. Thir\u00adty-six hos\u00adpi\u00adtals in Flori\u00adda closed as a result of Irma, and eight peo\u00adple were found dead in a swel\u00adter\u00ading Hol\u00adly\u00adwood, Fl. nurs\u00ading home where a pow\u00ader out\u00adage left more than 100 res\u00adi\u00addents with\u00adout air con\u00addi\u00adtion\u00ading. (Exact caus\u00ades of death are still being investigated.)\n\nIt\u2019s not as if there aren\u2019t exam\u00adples of what a more inno\u00adv\u00ada\u00adtive recov\u00adery could look like. In the wake of Hur\u00adri\u00adcane Sandy, storm-impact\u00aded states extend\u00aded financ\u00ading to towns that want\u00aded to devel\u00adop micro\u00adgrids. As a result, Con\u00adnecti\u00adcut became the first state to roll out a statewide micro\u00adgrid pro\u00adgram for busi\u00adness\u00ades and pub\u00adlic ser\u00advices to main\u00adtain pow\u00ader dur\u00ading out\u00adages, and cities such as Hobo\u00adken, N.J. and Fair\u00adfield, Conn. each accept\u00aded their states\u2019 offers.\n\nNew York launched a $40 mil\u00adlion com\u00adpe\u00adti\u00adtion called New York Prize, aimed at mak\u00ading pow\u00ader sys\u00adtems more resilient, with a focus on micro\u00adgrid tech\u00adnol\u00ado\u00adgy. Sandy was a launch pad for New York\u2019s \u200b\u201cReform\u00ading the Ener\u00adgy Vision,\u201d a 2013 plan to dras\u00adti\u00adcal\u00adly alter the state\u2019s ener\u00adgy reg\u00adu\u00adla\u00adtion land\u00adscape. Even New York City\u2019s biggest and hard\u00adly pro\u00adgres\u00adsive util\u00adi\u00adty providers \u2014 PSEG and ConEd \u2014 launched new grid man\u00adage\u00adment pro\u00adgrams in the months after the storm.\n\nLike PSEG and ConEd in New York, there are plen\u00adty of play\u00aders jump\u00ading on the micro\u00adgrid band\u00adwag\u00adon for pure\u00adly prag\u00admat\u00adic rea\u00adsons. For\u00admer FERC chair John Welling\u00adhoff sung their prais\u00ades, cit\u00ading the threats to cyber\u00adse\u00adcu\u00adri\u00adty posed by a high\u00adly cen\u00adtral\u00adized grid. The Depart\u00adment of Defense rec\u00adog\u00adnizes micro\u00adgrids as a key way to pro\u00adtect elec\u00adtric\u00adi\u00adty against ter\u00adror\u00adism and cyber\u00adat\u00adtacks. Fol\u00adlow\u00ading a direc\u00adtive in 2011\u2019s Nation\u00adal Defense Autho\u00adriza\u00adtion Act, the mil\u00adi\u00adtary is cur\u00adrent\u00adly deploy\u00ading them in its oper\u00ada\u00adtions around the world. Rick Perry\u2019s Depart\u00adment of Ener\u00adgy recent\u00adly announced that it would devote $50 mil\u00adlion to research into microgrids.\n\nMicro\u00adgrids are even mak\u00ading some head\u00adway in Flori\u00adda. Duke Ener\u00adgy \u2014 anoth\u00ader major elec\u00adtric\u00adi\u00adty provider there \u2014 had shown inter\u00adest in micro\u00adgrids even before Irma. The util\u00adi\u00adty is part of a $32 mil\u00adlion push from the Depart\u00adment of Ener\u00adgy into Resilient Dis\u00adtri\u00adb\u00adu\u00adtion Sys\u00adtems. The ini\u00adtia\u00adtive is one part of a $50 mil\u00adlion fund\u00ading round that includes $20 mil\u00adlion for a series of cyber\u00adse\u00adcu\u00adri\u00adty projects.\n\nDis\u00adtrib\u00aduted ener\u00adgy is also trendy in Sil\u00adi\u00adcon Val\u00adley, as well as often-over\u00adlap\u00adping green tech cir\u00adcles. In the Bay Area, Tes\u00adla and the city of San Fran\u00adcis\u00adco are each work\u00ading to get micro\u00adgrids online in the event of a major earth\u00adquake. One green tech sum\u00admit in Oak\u00adland last year, VERGE16, pow\u00adered itself entire\u00adly off of a microgrid.\n\nThe tech sector\u2019s excite\u00adment makes sense. To major \u2014 and espe\u00adcial\u00adly monop\u00adoly \u2014 util\u00adi\u00adties, micro\u00adgrids are an inher\u00adent\u00adly dis\u00adrup\u00adtive tech\u00adnol\u00ado\u00adgy, and repli\u00adcate some of the lib\u00ader\u00adtar\u00adi\u00adan-tinged shar\u00ading econ\u00ado\u00admy ethos that ani\u00admates every\u00adthing from Uber to Airbnb.\n\nAlso like those ser\u00advices, what\u2019s being trad\u00aded isn\u2019t the good\u00adwill of strangers, but real mon\u00adey. In that con\u00adtext, the scalar con\u00adcerns that come with micro\u00adgrids\u2019 promise seem almost self-evi\u00addent: If util\u00adi\u00adties allow them and there\u2019s a local appetite for it, com\u00admu\u00adni\u00adties that can afford to cre\u00adate a micro\u00adgrid will. For oth\u00aders, the finan\u00adcial bar\u00adri\u00aders to such a dras\u00adtic tran\u00adsi\u00adtion may well prove too high, espe\u00adcial\u00adly in more rur\u00adal areas with already aged infra\u00adstruc\u00adture. That\u2019s where util\u00adi\u00adties can come in.\n\n\u201cMaybe they use their staff to help con\u00adstruct the project\u2026maybe they help finance the sys\u00adtem, or build the cir\u00adcuit\u00adry,\u201d Far\u00adrell says. \u200b\u201cThere are a lot of ways that util\u00adi\u00adties could pro\u00advide their exper\u00adtise that are dif\u00adfer\u00adent rom sim\u00adply being the sole provider of elec\u00adtric\u00adi\u00adty.\u201d Crit\u00adi\u00adcal\u00adly, big util\u00adi\u00adties could help lev\u00adel the play\u00ading field to help more com\u00admu\u00adni\u00adties access clean, reli\u00adable and storm-resilient power.\n\nWhen it comes to investor-owned util\u00adi\u00adties, the issue isn\u2019t whether the tech\u00adnol\u00ado\u00adgy for such trans\u00adfor\u00adma\u00adtions is avail\u00adable, but whether there are prof\u00adits to be made. For poor neigh\u00adbor\u00adhoods, that may not always be the case. This means that even an earnest embrace of renew\u00adables and more dis\u00adtrib\u00aduted forms of ener\u00adgy gen\u00ader\u00ada\u00adtion could splin\u00adter uneven\u00adly \u2014 leav\u00ading more well-off ratepay\u00aders with state-of-the-art, clean-run\u00adning pow\u00ader that can oper\u00adate dur\u00ading a storm \u2014 and every\u00adone else reliant on out\u00admod\u00aded fuel and infrastructure.\n\nThe dilem\u00admas fac\u00ading micro\u00adgrids are those fac\u00ading renew\u00adables more gen\u00ader\u00adal\u00adly. While the recent growth of micro\u00adgrids has been excit\u00ading, a mas\u00adsive invest\u00adment in both research and devel\u00adop\u00adment \u2014 and actu\u00adal con\u00adstruc\u00adtion \u2014 is need\u00aded to bring such sys\u00adtems to scale. There\u2019s also no fed\u00ader\u00adal plan for what the tran\u00adsi\u00adtion away from fos\u00adsil fuels could look like. The fed\u00ader\u00adal gov\u00adern\u00adment and sev\u00ader\u00adal state gov\u00adern\u00adments \u2014 Florida\u2019s includ\u00aded \u2014 seem com\u00admit\u00adted to mak\u00ading sure that tran\u00adsi\u00adtion nev\u00ader hap\u00adpens. And even if there is polit\u00adi\u00adcal will to get off of fos\u00adsil fuels, how that tran\u00adsi\u00adtion is car\u00adried out could make the dif\u00adfer\u00adence between a cli\u00admate-changed future \u2014 rife with inequal\u00adi\u00adties \u2014 and one that pre\u00adserves every oth\u00ader form of inequal\u00adi\u00adty that\u2019s baked into our cur\u00adrent econ\u00ado\u00admy, only with more solar pan\u00adels and wind tur\u00adbines. Whether com\u00adpa\u00adnies are inter\u00adest\u00aded in devel\u00adop\u00ading micro\u00adgrids is a dif\u00adfer\u00adent ques\u00adtion from whether they\u2019ll help ensure every\u00adone can access them.\n\nAs Hur\u00adri\u00adcane Kat\u00adri\u00adna showed, cor\u00adpo\u00adra\u00adtions and cor\u00adpo\u00adrate-friend\u00adly gov\u00adern\u00adments are more than will\u00ading to swoop in after a major dis\u00adas\u00adter to pull pub\u00adlic goods into the pri\u00advate sec\u00adtor. In Texas, Hous\u00adton has already appoint\u00aded a for\u00admer Shell CEO to head its post-Har\u00advey recov\u00adery operation.\n\nThe ques\u00adtion Irma pos\u00ades is whether the oppo\u00adsite can hap\u00adpen. If util\u00adi\u00adties like FPL aren\u2019t will\u00ading to make the kinds of invest\u00adments need\u00aded to save lives when the worst hap\u00adpens, what alter\u00adna\u00adtives can take their place? And what does the fight look like to beat them polit\u00adi\u00adcal\u00adly? As the cli\u00admate cri\u00adsis accel\u00ader\u00adates, Amer\u00adi\u00adcans will face a fight over their pow\u00ader in more ways than one \u2014 espe\u00adcial\u00adly just after a dis\u00adas\u00adter strikes."
