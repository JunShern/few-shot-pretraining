When I create a new user with full rights and password, it is working.\nWas there something changed?\n\nA:\n\nSo you've gone from version 5.5.44-1ubuntu0.14.04.1 to 10.0.20-0ubuntu0.15.04.1. Sounds scarier than it is, that's just what they called 5.6 for some reason.\nIt seems that newer versions of MariaDB have added a plugin to the user table to force authentication through a fixed path. In this case, the root database user is forced through the unix_socket plugin. This also seems to be known as auth_socket in some circles.\nAnyway this plugin restricts things so only the system root user can log in as the database root, with no password. It's a security choice they've made.\nYou can revert this by blanking the plugin field for the root user:\nshell$ sudo mysql -u root\n\n[mysql] use mysql;\n[mysql] update user set plugin='' where User='root';\n[mysql] flush privileges;\n\nA specified password should work after this. I'm not sure how advisable this is though. \n\n"
