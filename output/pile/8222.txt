The program uses one resource which I was hoping to put inside of the JAR but Eclipse will not put in the executable jar no matter which option I tick when I export or which folder the resource is in - the first problem!\nThe second problem is that whenever I tell eclipse to \"Extract required libraries into generated JAR\" I receive the following error when I double click on the executable Jar:\n\nCould not find the main class: main.Launcher. Program will exit.\n\nI don't suppose that the second problem is too much of an issue at the minute but the first one is extremely frustrating so I would appreciate any help or advice. Thanks in advance.\n(Strangely, and even more frustrating, if I go through the same process with a project I made a while ago with a previous version of Eclipse it works perfectly.)\nThe folder structure of the project is as follows:\nIn the project folder there are the following directories .settings, bin, src as default. I have put the resource, which is a png in the bin folder but I have also tried it in the src folder.\n\nA:\n\nFirst of all, I would like to thank Mike (marksml) for being so helpful and attempting to provide a solution for my problem. Unfortunately, his answer did not work for me!\nI began to look at all of my previous projects and noticed that the one I was having trouble with was the odd one out (because it was the only one that didn't work) and the factor that made it the odd one out, I found to be the JRE system library version. The project was using the JavaSE-1.7 library but when I changed it to the JavaSE-1.6 like my other projects were using it miraculously worked and exported flawlessly! I'm still curious as to why this is the case, but at least I have it working now...\nWith thanks and kind regards, Andy\n\n"
