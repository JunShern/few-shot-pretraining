Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed sources usually estimate the worldwide Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed population to be above 5 million. Most encyclopedias and similar sources estimate between 5 and 6 million Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds in the world in the early 21st century. The religion is almost entirely contained in a single, organized, hierarchical community, but the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed population is spread out into almost every country and ethnicity in the world, being recognized as the second-most geographically widespread religion after Christianity. See Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed statistics.\n\nSummary\n\u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1, the son of the founder of the religion, wrote a series of letters, or tablets, to the followers of the religion in the United States in 1916\u20131917; these letters were compiled together in the book titled Tablets of the Divine Plan. The sixth of the tablets was the first to mention Latin American regions and was written on 8 April 1916, but was delayed in being presented in the United States until 1919\u2014after the end of the First World War and the Spanish flu pandemic. The first actions on the part of Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed community towards Latin America were that of a few individuals who made trips to Mexico and South America near or before this unveiling in 1919, including Mr. and Mrs. Frankland, and individuals who would later be appointed as Hands of the Cause like Roy C. Wilhelm, and Martha Root. The sixth tablet was translated and presented by Mirza Ahmad Sohrab on 4 April 1919, and published in Star of the West magazine on 12 December 1919.\n\nHis Holiness Christ says: Travel ye to the East and to the West of the world and summon the people to the Kingdom of God.\u2026(travel to) the Islands of the West Indies, such as Cuba, Haiti, Puerto Rico, Jamaica, the Islands of the Lesser Antilles (which includes Barbados), Bahama Islands, even the small Watling Island, have great importance\u2026\n\nIn 1927 Leonora Armstrong was the first Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed to visit many of these countries where she gave lectures about the religion as part of her plan to complement and complete Martha Root's unfulfilled intention of visiting all the Latin American countries for the purpose of presenting the religion to an audience.\n\nSeven Year Plan and succeeding decades\nShoghi Effendi, head of the religion after the death of \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 in 1921, wrote a cable on 1 May 1936 to the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Annual Convention of the United States and Canada, and asked for the systematic implementation of \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1's vision to begin. In his cable he wrote:\nAppeal to assembled delegates ponder historic appeal voiced by \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 in Tablets of the Divine Plan. Urge earnest deliberation with incoming National Assembly to insure its complete fulfillment. First century of Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Era drawing to a close. Humanity entering outer fringes most perilous stage its existence. Opportunities of present hour unimaginably precious. Would to God every State within American Republic and every Republic in American continent might ere termination of this glorious century embrace the light of the Faith of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h and establish structural basis of His World Order.\n\nFollowing the 1 May cable, another cable from Shoghi Effendi came on 19 May calling for permanent pioneers to be established in all the countries of Latin America. The Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada appointed the Inter-America Committee to take charge of the preparations. During the 1937 Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed North American Convention, Shoghi Effendi cabled advising the convention to prolong their deliberations to permit the delegates and the National Assembly to consult on a plan that would enable Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds to go to Latin America as well as to include the completion of the outer structure of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed House of Worship in Wilmette, Illinois.  In 1937 the First Seven Year Plan  (1937\u201344), which was an international plan designed by Shoghi Effendi, gave the American Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds the goal of establishing the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith in every country in Latin America. With the spread of American Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds in Latin American, Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed communities and Local Spiritual Assemblies began to form in 1938 across the rest of Latin America.\n\nIn 1946, a great pioneer movement, the Ten Year Crusade, began with, for example, sixty percent of the British Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed community eventually relocating.\n\nAs far back as 1951 the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds had organized a regional National Assembly for the combination of Mexico, Central America and the Antilles islands. Many counties formed their own National Assembly in 1961. Others continued to be organized in regional areas growing progressively smaller. From 1966 the region was reorganized among the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds of Leeward, Windward and Virgin Islands with its seat in Charlotte Amalie.\n\nAmong the more notable visitors was Hand of the Cause Ruhiyyih Khanum when she toured Caribbean Islands for five weeks in 1970.\n\nCountries\n\nBarbados\n\nThe first Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed to visit Barbados was Leonora Armstrong in 1927 while pioneers who moved to the island arrived by 1964. With local converts they elected the first Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Local Spiritual Assembly in 1965. During October 1966 a trip to ten islands was planned by Lorraine Landau, a pioneer in Barbados. Hand of the Cause \u02bbAl\u00ed-Muhammad Varq\u00e1 attended the inaugural election of the Barbados Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds National Spiritual Assembly in 1981. Since then Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds have participated in several projects for the benefit of the wider community and in 2001 various sources report up to 1.2% of the island, about 3,500 citizens are Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds though Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed and government census data report far lower numbers.  In fact, the 2010 Barbados census recorded 178 Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds out of a total population of 250,010.\n\nBelize\nThe Association of Religion Data Archives estimates there were 7,776 Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds in Belize in 2005, or 2.5% of the national population. If correct, the Association of Religion Data Archives' estimates suggest this is the highest proportion of Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds in any country. Their data also states that the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith is the second most common religion in Belize, followed by Hinduism (2.0%) and Judaism (1.1%). However the 2010 Belize Population Census recorded 202 Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds out of a total population of 304,106, yielding a proportion of 0.066%, not 2.5%.\n\nCosta Rica\n\nThe first pioneers began to settle in Coast Rica in 1940. followed quickly by the first Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Local Spiritual Assembly being elected in San Jos\u00e9 in April 1941. The National Spiritual Assembly was first elected in 1961. Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds sources as of 2009 the national community includes various peoples and tribes of over 4,000 members organized in groups in over 30 locations throughout the country. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying mostly on the World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 13000 Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds in 2005.\n\nDominica\n\nThe island of Dominica was specifically listed as an objective for plans on spreading the religion in 1939 Shoghi Effendi, who succeeded \u02bbAbdu'l-Baha as head of the religion. In 1983 Bill Nedden is credited with being the first pioneer to Dominica at the festivities associated with the inaugural election of the Dominican Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds National Spiritual Assembly with Hand of the Cause, Dhikru'llah Khadem representing the Universal House of Justice. Since then Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds have participated in several projects for the benefit of the wider community and in 2001 various sources report between less than 1.4% up to 1.7% of the island's about 70,000 citizens are Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds.\n\nHaiti\n\nThe first Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed to visit Haiti was Leonora Armstrong in 1927. After that others visited until Louis George Gregory visited in January 1937 and he mentions a small community of Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds operating in Haiti. The first long term pioneers, Ruth and Ellsworth Blackwell, arrived in 1940. Following their arrival the first Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Local Spiritual Assembly of Haiti was formed in 1942 in Port-au-Prince. From 1951 the Haitian Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds participated in regional organizations of the religion until 1961 when Haitian Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds elected their own National Spiritual Assembly and soon took on goals reaching out into neighboring islands. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying mostly on the World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 23000 Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds in Haiti in 2005.\n\nJamaica\n\nThe community of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds begins in 1942 with the arrival of Dr. Malcolm King. The first Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Local Spiritual Assembly of Jamaica, in Kingston, was elected in 1943. By 1957 the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds of Jamaica were organized under the regional National Spiritual Assembly of the Greater Antilles, and on the eve of national independence in 1962, the Jamaica Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds elected their own National Spiritual Assembly in 1961. By 1981 hundreds of Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds and hundreds more non-Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds turned out for weekend meetings when R\u00fah\u00edyyih Kh\u00e1num spent six days in Jamaica. Public recognition of the religion came in the form of the Governor General of Jamaica, Sir Howard Cooke, proclaiming a National Baha'i Day first on 25 July in 2003 and it has been an annual event since. While there is evidence of several active communities by 2008 in Jamaica, estimates of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds population range from the hundreds to the thousands. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 5137 Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds in 2005.\n\nPanama\n\nThe same year as the release of the Tablets of the Divine Plan in 1919 Martha Root's made a trip around South America and included Panama on the return leg of the trip up the west coast. The first pioneers began to settle in Panama in 1940. The first Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Local Spiritual Assembly of Panama, in Panama City, was elected in 1946, and National Spiritual Assembly was first elected in 1961. The Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds of Panama raised a Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed House of Worship in 1972. In 1983 and again in 1992 some commemorative stamps were produced in Panama while the community turned its interests to the San Miguelito and Chiriqui regions of Panama with schools and a radio station. One recent estimation of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed community of Panama was of 2.00% of the national population, or about 60000, in 2006. The Association of Religion Data Archives estimated there were some 41000 Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds in 2005 and the largest religious minority in the country.\n\nTrinidad and Tobago\n\nThe Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith in Trinidad and Tobago begins with a mention by \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1, then head of the religion, in 1916 as the Caribbean was among the places Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds should take the religion to. The first Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed to visit came in 1927 while pioneers arrived by 1956 and the first Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Local Spiritual Assembly was elected in 1957 In 1971 the first Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed National Spiritual Assembly was elected. A count of the community then noted 27 assemblies with Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds living in 77 locations. Since then Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds have participated in several projects for the benefit of the wider community and in 2005/10 various sources report near 1.2% of the country, about 10\u201316,000\n\nSee also\n:Category:Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith by country\nBah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith and Native Americans\nBah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed statistics\nReligions by country\nIslam by country\nJudaism by country\nHinduism by country\nChristianity by country\nSikhism by country\nNo Faith by Country\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nBah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed World Statistics\nadherents.com \u2013 A website about religious adherents of numerous faiths\nadherents.com \u2013 Specific compiled stats on Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed communities\n\nCategory:Articles with inconsistent citation formats\n Central America"
