    "text": "With just 69 days left until team\u2019s report back for preseason training (January 22, 2018), the list of offseason drafts and dates has been announced by MLS in preparation for the 2017 Expansion Draft. The Expansion Draft will finally announce the arrival of the LA Galaxy\u2019s newest neighbor as Los Angeles Football Club (LAFC) becomes the 23rd team in the league.\n\nEXPANSION DRAFT\n\nThe Expansion Draft, set for December 12 at 11 AM PT, will see LAFC choose up to a maximum of five players from the league\u2019s other 22 teams.\n\nLAFC can only pick one player from each team and all Homegrown players and Generation Adidas players are automatically protected.\n\nDesignated players are not automatically protected and a club would leave them unprotected at their own risk. If the Designated Player has a no-trade clause then the team must protect them with one of their 11 protection spots.\n\nThis new format is following the 2016 Expansion Draft that brought Atlanta United and Minnesota United into the club. With each team picking a total number of five players. In previous expansion drafts, as many as 10 players were allowed to be selected by each team entering the league.\n\nGeneral Allocation money will be awarded to LAFC in place of the additional picks.\n\nADDITIONAL DRAFTS AND ROSTER DEADLINES\n\nIn addition, MLS has also released the key dates around which important information for building rosters in 2018 will be decided upon by teams and supposedly released to the public (See the Chart Below).\n\nThe Galaxy will need to release the names of players whose options they are exercising (most MLS contracts are two years with the club holding options on each player for the second year), and who are receiving bona fide offers.\n\nThe bona fide offer is important to retaining the rights to a player if they should exit the league and keeps teams from directly competing against each other. If a team makes a bona fide offer and the player rejects the offer the club would retain his rights if any team wanted to sign him. That might mean a trade between the two teams in order to acquire that player.\n\nIt\u2019s a complicated system that rarely makes much sense but was instituted to keep the single entity system of MLS intact.\n\nReports have already surfaced that the Galaxy have released Homegrown players Jack McBean, Jose Villarreal, Jaime Villarreal, Nathan Smith, and Raul Mendiola. With other names expected to join that list shortly.\n\nIf one was in speculation mode, the expanded list would include all three of the Galaxy\u2019s goalkeepers \u2013 Brian Rowe, Jon Kempin, Clement Diop \u2013 and players like Ariel Lassiter, Bradley Diallo, and Rafael Garcia among others.\n\nWith as many as 15 spots cleared from the 30-man roster, the Galaxy will be the \u201clucky\u201d beneficiaries of the first pick in three of the offseason drafts and will get the second overall pick in the MLS Cup Super Draft.\n\nThey\u2019ll pick first in the 2017 MLS Waiver Draft \u2013 consisting of players who have been waived by clubs and do not meet the minimum years of service requirement for Re-Entry draft or Free Agency \u2013 and in both stages of the Re-Entry Draft (stage 1 and stage 2)\n\nThe Re-Entry Draft will consist of players who are out of contract or have had their options declined by the club with a bunch of qualifying caveats.\n\nMLS Expansion Draft Rules (CLICK)\n\n(CLICK) Free Agency Rules (CLICK)\n\n(CLICK) MLS Waiver Draft Rules (CLICK)\n\n(CLICK) MLS Re-Entry Draft Rules (CLICK)\n\nWhile it seems a long way off, momentum is going to start to build towards the 2017 MLS Cup and the expansion draft. The first draft of the season marks the turning point as everyone shifts their attention towards 2018 and building a competitive roster for the upcoming campaign.\n\nFor the Galaxy, it will be even more important. With the Expansion Draft unlikely to greatly affect the Galaxy, their sights must be set on outperforming their crosstown rival and getting back into a competitive position for the playoffs.\n\nAnother misstep that leads to another rebuild is just something this franchise can\u2019t afford to mess around with.\n\nThe pressure is now on Sigi Schmid, Kurt Schmid, and the rest of the Galaxy\u2019s front office to rebuild through these drafts and other player acquisition mechanisms to plug the holes that were left by former General Manager Pete Vagenas and to build depth across the entire squad.\n\nSomething that is much easier said than done.\n\nIf 2018 is going to be a successful year, the moves that are made in the next 45 days should begin to show us the foundation on which the \u201cnew look\u201d Galaxy are building.\n\n2017 OFFSEASON CALENDAR\n\nNov. 27 --------------- --------------- 11 AM PT Option Exercise Deadline Clubs no longer competing in the Audi 2017 MLS Cup Playoffs must notify the League Office in writing of (1) players whose options they are exercising and/or (2) players who are receiving bona fide offers, announced by the teams.\n\n\n\nAll roster decisions will be publicized by the individual clubs.
