Maybe written in Mono, or perhaps something else.\nIt has been suggested to me that I will need to pay a license fee for this. The Android licensing documentation hasn't cleared this up in my mind.\nDo I need to implement any form of licensing or pay any license for this? I stress, the app will be for use by me alone (and maybe my wife), on my phone alone (or hers). It won't go near Google Play Store or anything like that.\n\nA:\n\nAs long as you don't submit the app to Google Play store, you don't need the licence. You can use the app or even give it to your family and friends. However, you cannot submit to the app store.\n\n"
