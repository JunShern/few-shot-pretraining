I get a long list of policy based nat in the format of 'static (outside,inside) x.x.x.x access-list '  Which is what I would expect to have seen from one of those previously attempted commands.\nWhat commands need to be run to see everything involving nat on a 7.2 ASA?  I am not seeing any kind of DST nat (which I expect in this particular case) for the tunnel I'm looking at, but yet the tunnel is up and passing traffic, so it's happening somewhere!\nThank you in advance!\n\nA:\n\n'show run static' is a usable show command as well.\n\nA:\n\nshow global\nshow nat\nshow static\nshow conduit (unless you've switched to ACLs)\nOf course, that's going to be 90% of the entire configuration anyway. (more if pdm isn't enabled, thus flooding the config with pdm location ...)\n\n"
