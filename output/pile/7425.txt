    "text": "The 7 Biggest SEO Lessons I Learned from a Google Employee\n\nIn the past, I broke down the most vital SEO strategy I learned, which came from a Google employee. This time, I thought I would do something similar and share the 7 biggest SEO lessons that I learned from a Google employee.\n\nSome of these things you may already know, but most you probably aren\u2019t too familiar with. And of course, I am not telling you anything that would jeopardize my relationship with or the career of the Google employee.\n\nSo here goes, these are the 7 biggest SEO lessons I learned from a Google employee.\n\nLesson #1: Penalizations and bans don\u2019t work the way most people think\n\nGoogle\u2019s goal isn\u2019t to penalize sites. Their goal is to serve the most relevant listing to each searcher.\n\nFor example, if BMW had a handful of bad links pointing to it or they were caught building links, it could be foolish to ban or penalize BMW.\n\nThe reason being is that BMW is a popular brand\u2026 there are millions of people each year who search for the term \u201cBMW.\u201d\n\nSee, the average person doesn\u2019t know what SEO is. They also don\u2019t care about link building or even Google\u2019s algorithm. They just expect to see BMW.com when they search for \u201cBMW\u201d and if they don\u2019t, they are disappointed in Google.\n\nPlus, BMW is a brand. Google loves brands and trusts them more because you as a consumer trust brands.\n\nAs the Ex-Google CEO Eric Schmidt once said:\n\nBrands are the solution, not the problem. Brands are how you sort out the cesspool.\n\nNow, hypothetically speaking, if Google decided to remove BMW.com from their index and showed you a random site when you searched for \u201cBMW\u201d, Google knows you will be disappointed based on click-through data. And when users are disappointed with Google, there is a higher chance they won\u2019t come back and use Google again, which means less ad revenue in the long run.\n\nFor this reason, Google doesn\u2019t just ban or penalize sites, they keep fine-tuning their algorithm to ignore bad signals such as paid links or negative SEO.\n\nFor example, if your competitor all of a sudden sends 1,000 spammy backlinks to your site, there is a high likelihood that Google sees this as negative SEO and ignores it.\n\nI experienced this when I started a nutrition site years ago (I no longer own it). Someone built thousands of adult links to the site and it made up the majority of the backlinks.\n\nThe site was generating well over 100,000 visitors a month from Google before the adult links kicked in\u2026 and can you guess what happened when they indexed all of those bad links?\n\nNothing!\n\nGoogle was smart enough to see that it was unnatural so they just ignored it. My traffic stayed the same.\n\nAs long as you aren\u2019t doing anything bad, you shouldn\u2019t worry about penalizations.\n\nLesson #2: Google prefers automation\n\nYes, there is a webspam team, but Google prefers automation. They leverage technologies like machine learning to figure out what\u2019s wrong and how to fix it in the future.\n\nAnd, of course, in an automated fashion. They don\u2019t want to hire thousands of people to manually fine-tune their algorithm.\n\nThis is one of the big reasons that Digg didn\u2019t get acquired by Google years ago\u2026 it was because Digg\u2019s algorithm required a lot of human intervention and their engineers weren\u2019t up to par with Google\u2019s.\n\nYou are going to see constant updates on Google\u2019s algorithm on sites like Search Engine Land and Search Engine Roundtable.\n\nBut if you focus on what\u2019s best for your users, you should do well in the long run.\n\nAs for your traffic swings because of algorithm updates, it\u2019s natural. It happens to all of us.\n\nIf their algorithm was perfect you wouldn\u2019t see constant updates. But like every good company, they learn from their successes and failures and adapt. And, of course, they try to do this in an automated way.\n\nAgain, as long as you do what\u2019s best for your users, you should see a nice growth in search traffic over time.\n\nDon\u2019t worry if you see a slight drop due to an algorithm update if you are doing what\u2019s best for users. And don\u2019t worry if a spammy competitor outranks you because it won\u2019t last forever. Their ranking algorithm isn\u2019t perfect, but it is really good and keeps getting better over time.\n\nLesson #3: Don\u2019t waste your money on expired domains (or other shortcuts)\n\nWhen I was in my early 20s, I thought I was a hotshot marketer. I thought I was smarter than a multi-hundred-billion-dollar search engine and that I figured out a shortcut to climb to the top.\n\nOne of those tricks was to purchase expired domains and optimize them. I purchased domains that had EDU and GOV backlinks and skyrocketed to the top of Google for terms like \u201conline casino.\u201d\n\nCan you guess what eventually happened?\n\nMy rankings tanked!\n\nJust like any shortcut that can drastically boost your rankings, it will get closed. The question becomes when.\n\nI know for a fact that expired domains don\u2019t work that well. Not just due to my experience but because Google knows marketers buy them and either 301 redirect them to their site or create a network of blogs to leverage for backlinks.\n\nGoogle is also a registrar like GoDaddy, don\u2019t you think they have all of the information you have, plus more, on domains? \ud83d\ude09\n\nLesson #4: Google ignores most guest post links\n\nDo you get those emails from people offering you paid links on Entrepreneur, Forbes, Buzzfeed, and many other sites that have a high domain authority?\n\nWell, we all do.\n\nAnd they just don\u2019t stop\u2026\n\nNowadays, most of the big sites like Entrepreneur nofollow their links. But even if they didn\u2019t, it isn\u2019t hard to figure out which URLs and profiles on these sites are guest posts.\n\nJust search for \u201cguest writer\u201d on Entrepreneur and you\u2019ll find tons of articles like this.\n\nBy no means am I saying that the author above is selling links, I am saying that it isn\u2019t hard for Google to spot these type of posts and devalue the links even if the publication decides to use do-follow links.\n\nHeck, Google even commented on how links from Forbes were useless.\n\nAs Google commented\u2026\n\nGoogle devalues or ignores bad links, which reflects the changes we saw in Penguin, where Google devalues those links rather than penalizing for them.\n\nIf you want to build links through guest posts\u2026 especially obvious ones that clearly state the article was a guest post, don\u2019t expect those links to have much of an impact on your search rankings.\n\nLesson #5: Google isn\u2019t trying to take clicks away from your website, they are trying to build a better product\n\nOver the last few years, I continually saw SEOs complaining about how Google is just trying to keep people on Google and not drive any traffic to their websites anymore.\n\nSome of these marketers even claim it is unfair because they are just scraping content from your site and using it for their own benefit.\n\nLet\u2019s be honest here\u2026 none of you are going to block Google from crawling your site. You should be happy that you are getting traffic for free!\n\nWho cares if Google scrapes your content\u2026 some free traffic is better than none.\n\nIt\u2019s a big misconception that Google just wants to keep people on their own site. The real truth to this is that Google wants to do what is best for searchers, not marketers.\n\nFor example, one could say that they only care about ad revenue and they should blanket the page with ads\u2026 funny enough, though, over time they have reduced the number of ads per page by removing all sidebar ads.\n\nYes, they are placing a few more ads at the top to make up for it, but overall it is still fewer ads per page.\n\nI know many of you don\u2019t like this, but they are a publicly traded company\u2026 they have to make money. And, ideally, more money each quarter.\n\nWhether it is the knowledge graph or a mobile-first index, their goal is to do what is best for searchers. They know that if they do that their traffic will go up over time and a small portion of you will click on ads.\n\nIt really is that simple.\n\nThey don\u2019t make these decisions based on what they want to do\u2026 they are logical engineers that use data.\n\nFor example, if 99% of their traffic said they hate knowledge graphs, there would be no knowledge graphs. Or if 99% of their users wanted more links per page going to external sites, then that is what they would add.\n\nThey do whatever you want, assuming you have the same opinion as of the masses.\n\nThe lesson to be learned here, don\u2019t worry about Google taking your content or not driving as many clicks to organic results versus paid. You will constantly see changes coming, especially with the popularity of voice search. Know that these changes are based on data that the masses want.\n\nLesson #6: The biggest search opportunity currently lies in YouTube\n\nGoogle loves text-based content. That\u2019s part of the reason why so many companies have a blog.\n\nBut it isn\u2019t as easy to rank on Google as it used to be\u2026 unless you expand internationally. But even that is getting more competitive as we speak.\n\nThe biggest opportunity in search is YouTube. According to Alexa, it is the second most popular site on the web and people tend to find their content on YouTube using the search feature.\n\nIf you aren\u2019t convinced that you should start going after YouTube SEO, here are some interesting stats for you:\n\nYouTube has 1.9 billion monthly active users\n\nOnly 50 million users are creating and sharing video content\n\nAverage viewing session is 40 minutes\n\nRoughly 5 billion videos are watched per day\n\nMobile devices account for 500 million daily video views\n\nIf that doesn\u2019t convince you to go after YouTube, just look at my stats. I should have done it much sooner as the employee at Google pushed me to create videos years ago but I was a bit slow to move on their advice.\n\nAnd now I am generating 724,464 views a month:\n\nOf which 185,290 comes from YouTube search:\n\nHow many of you can say your website is generating over 100,000 visitors a month from Google?\n\nThat\u2019s the power of YouTube\u2026 it has volume and it is easier to rank than on Google. Just look at me, I generated over 100,000 views a month in less than a year from YouTube SEO.\n\nLesson #7: You are not going to like the future\n\nI saved the biggest lesson for last because it affects most marketers who are used to Google in its current form and how it has been for years.\n\nFrom all of my conversations with people who work at Google, they all know the world is changing and they want to make sure Google adapts with it and, more importantly, stays ahead.\n\nFor example, they know a lot of searches are going through voice devices like Alexa and Google Home. If you just look at mobile devices, voice already accounts for 20% of the searches.\n\nAnd it is happening at a rapid pace based on the graph below:\n\nAnd it isn\u2019t stopping there. Both the Internet world and the real world are starting to be connected.\n\nFrom self-driving cars, which Google has spent billions of dollars on, to simpler things you use every day that Google is starting to connect with (like your stove and fridge).\n\nThey want to control it all. And not in a creepy way, more so in a way that makes your life easier.\n\nFor example, if you are cooking and are unsure about a recipe, they want to be there to make sure that you are doing everything correctly.\n\nAs for what it will look like in the future, no one knows yet, not even Google. But they are paying smart product people and engineers to solve these problems. For example, they know that kids aren\u2019t using Google search the same way adults are.\n\nA good example of this is when my 8-year-old nephew isn\u2019t sure about something, he asks Alexa. I, on the other hand, will perform a search on my laptop.\n\nAll we can do here is make sure that we adapt with technology to ensure that we keep getting traffic from Google. This doesn\u2019t mean to just adapt your SEO strategy but more so to adapt your business and ensure that you are staying on top of things and providing users with what they want.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs SEOs, we continually try and play a game of cat and mouse. But why?\n\nInstead of wasting our time on short-term thinking, why not start putting yourself in your customers\u2019 shoes?\n\nThat\u2019s what Google is doing. And the changes they are making to their search engine, their future product roadmap, and even to their algorithm are based on what people want.\n\nIf you want to continually do well, yes you still need to do traditional SEO. But you need to start thinking about your end user and do what\u2019s best for them.\n\nSo, what\u2019s your SEO game plan now?"
