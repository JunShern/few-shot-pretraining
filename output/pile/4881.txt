    "text": "Sugar Bytes recently announced a new bassline synth, Cyclop, that they call \u2018the future of bass\u2019.\n\nThey released this promo video for Cyclop today. While it doesn\u2019t provided any new details on the synth, it does offer a preview of the bassline synths\u2019s sound.\n\nHere\u2019s what they have to say about Cyclop:\n\nIt\u2019s a monophonic monster, armed to the teeth with jaw dropping effects and wobblier than a jelly on a space hopper. CYCLOP is the scratch-looping, sample-mashing, sub-generating, harmonic-splicing mothership of the twisted bass alliance and it\u2019s landing on your desktop soon.\n\nWith masses of new sounds for you audio-junkies, from screaming analog syncs through brutal FM sounds to scintillating spectral shimmers. The integrated sampler also works as wavetable synth and pitch transformer for creating unbelievable and disturbing monster voices. CYCLOP is more than massively loaded with features: 10 incredible filters, unique wobble generator, feedback processor, 3 overdrives and an effects sequencer.\n\nCYCLOP is expected to be released in spring 2012. Pricing is TBA.via SugarBytes:\n\nThat is an impressively well-crafted teaser. Makes it look like this is a pretty flexible and powerful synth. Not clear what\u2019s new about it\u2013 other than a space invaders game built-in. The dancing projector-bot was fun.\n\nDubstep, for the most part, is not about traditional musicality in any sense; it\u2019s about making kids go nuts on the dancefloor, and to that end it is well suited. This genre is completely visceral, designed to illicit an adrenaline charged response from young people. The ebb and flow of trance is here, but with a much quicker build and a massive explosion of bass at climax. This is something that just flat out works on the dancefloor. I\u2019m guessing, given that you have referenced disco, that you are an older fellow, and probably have not experienced this music in a festival/rave type setting with thousands of smoking hot, half naked girls going ballistic to these sounds. It\u2019s like the punk rock of EDM; anyone can do it on some level, but it still takes a talented producer to make the good stuff.\n\nive seen this kind of thing come and go plenty of times\u2026 some years down the road, when the next \u201cbig thing\u201d comes along, i wonder if youd be surprised to find the \u201cold school\u201d brosteppers bitching about it\n\nFor me,Dubstep ain\u2019t my bag,however I don\u2019t feel any great compulsion to trash it or go around deriding it.It\u2019s just not for me.\n\nThat being said I think creating a synth designed for only one genre is a fantastically bad idea.\nDo you think Moog would still be a big name if all those synths could be used for was Prog Rock and Fusion? Much as I love those genres,short answer no.\nI like most of the stuff this dev produces,so here\u2019s hoping the internal architecture of this prog is not just limited to wobble basses,and provides wider scope for wider expression.\n\nJust looked at the spec,(rather than just the video). It seems like my concerns were for naught.\nAlthough it would be good if it were made clear for your average user who (unlike me) doesn\u2019t roll their own presets.A campaign that had all the other types of sound that such a synth could produce then had a bunch of wobbles near the end may be less alienating for potential customers of an Anti-Dubsteppist denomination.\n\nI believe one of the highlight features to emerge will be the sample transformer. Load in a sound \u2014 it could be the sound of your voice \u2014 and sculpt it into something very nasty while scrubbing the waveform back/forth. I\u2019ve had great fun with this while I was \u201cbeta testing\u201d, as heard at the very beginning: http://bit.ly/K4wQqL\n\n\u201cDubstep\u201d is a useful reference and common familiarity, which facilitates discussions of going beyond any limiting genre labels. Like science popularizing, it helps to communicate in ways that appeal, then transition open minds \u2014 and ears \u2014 from there.\n\nMe I would rather hear some wobbles them the same kick/snare or amen break a MILLION times over. But thats just me. Yes dubstep is starting to become lame. But at least it doesn\u2019t sound like ever other electronic music.\n\nUgh\u2026 Can we just have a final knock down drag out argument about dubstep and be done with it. Every time a synth is featured here and it has even a second of dubstep somebodys got to spout their mouth about it. Thread gets hijacked and ends up with the same people arguing over a genre instead of talking about the synth. I don\u2019t really see anything ground breaking with this vst. It\u2019s a bummer seeing good company\u2019s bolt on features to make it easier for people to be unoriginal. However it pays the bills. So it goes\u2026\n\nAnyone have any opinions on the actual sound quality of Cyclop? I can\u2019t make my mind up for some reason. Im not quite sure if it stands up to the quality and clarity of other top synths from the like of NI and U-HE. Not that it doesnt have a place of its own in any VST collection anyway.\n\nAnyone that cant look past the genre specific advertising and terminology within cyclop is a fool. As a monophonic synth it seems quite fun for creating bass, leads, sound effects and noises of all kinds for any genre."
