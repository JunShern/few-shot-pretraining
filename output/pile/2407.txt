    "text": "Brad Troemel\n\nBrad Troemel (born 1987) is an American artist, writer and instructor based in New York City. Troemel is most well known for his development of the Tumblr website The Jogging which has received attention for its work in post internet art.\n\nEducation\nBrad Troemel received a BA in Visual Critical Studies from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, and an MFA from New York University NYU Steinhardt.\n\nWork\nIn 2008, Troemel launched the website On The Make with curator Karly Wildenhaus. That year, Troemel opened the Chicago-based art gallery Scott Projects.\n\nStarting in 2009, Troemel, along with artist Lauren Christiansen, began digitally compositing images that depicted irreverent installation scenes and sculptures on the Tumblr website The Jogging.  Jogging concluded with months of polarizing conspiracy images made by Troemel and the artist Edward Shenk, what critic Zachary Kaplan called \"a body of image macros that took on the look and feel of Truther and right-wing, anti-Obama propaganda while simultaneously subverting it through absurdist content.\"\n\nIn 2011 Troemel began a series of exhibitions with his use of Bitcoin and the Silk Road black market. For the exhibition \"The Social Life of Things\" in Rotterdam, Troemel used a number of objects from the marketplace including a Fake ID containing his real details and picture, bump keys and psychedelic drug seeds which were presented in an installation. Those objects were presented for free to be further used by visitors and Troemel himself used Silk Road-purchased identification to travel from New York to Rotterdam for the exhibition.\n\nIn 2012, Troemel launched an Etsy store primarily featuring temporary food sculptures designed to fall apart during their shipment through the postal service. \n\nTroemel's 2014 exhibition Live/Work at Tomorrow Gallery featured a series of hanging colored ant tanks, each indicative of a different trio of charities. The run of the exhibition served as a competition between the various ant tanks to see which could most productively dig the most tunnels, earning the charity that the ants represented 10% of the exhibitions' proceeds.\n\nIn 2015 Troemel partnered with Joshua Citarella, a former collaborator from Jogging, to create UV Production House, an Etsy store providing material kits and fabrication guidance to collectors for all-original works. In 2016 exhibition \"Freecaching\", Troemel concealed his entire studio inventory in Central Park and presented GPS coordinates as magnetic puzzle certificates of authenticity at Tomorrow Gallery. He described, the exhibition was meant to be a proof of concept for discretely utilizing public space as a sharing economy art storage business model.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:1987 births\nCategory:New York University faculty\nCategory:Artists from New York (state)\nCategory:Date of birth unknown"
