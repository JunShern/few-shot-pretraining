    "text": "The GROBAT is a small-diameter bat featuring a movable Sweetspot Simulator pad that tells the batter that he (or she) is using the correct area on the bat, the sweetspot. Since this area is smaller than that of a regular bat, hand-eye coordination and confidence of the batter improves dramatically!\n\nUnlike other hitting \u201csticks\u201d however, the GROBAT is unique because of its variable length AND weight, and thus can be used by multiple persons of different age and size, or by one person who is growing quickly! It is critically important that during extended batting practice, the hitter use his GAME BAT to maintain proper timing and mechanics. Use of any training device that does NOT mimic the dynamics of the game bat is detrimental to developing consistent swing mechanics. Using lighter or heavier bats in extended practice can defeat their intended purpose \u2014 better hitting!\n\nUnlike other bats, GROBAT can be easily modified in both length AND weight, and comes equipped with a movable choke/collar and a set of weights from 2 to 9 ounces. The GROBAT can mimic any bat, from 28\"/19oz. to 34\"/33oz., or anything in between!\n\nThe GROBAT collar can also be used on the handle of a regular bat (see photo above), so that when you purchase your next bat, you can get a 1\" or 2\" larger bat which will \u201cgrow\u201d with your son (or daughter), saving money and maintaining familiarity.\n\nThe GROBAT is available in 30\", 32\", 33\" and 34\" standard lengths and, un-weighted, are 19, 20, 21, and 22 oz. respectively. The coin-removable threaded end plug allows insertion of any combination of 2, 3, or 4-ounce weights (see photo).\n\nThese features allow the GROBAT to be used as a light weight \u201cstick\u201d to develop quick speed through the zone, or it can be over-loaded to develop and stretch the large muscle groups. This type of practice should be between 20 and 30 percent of your practice regimen, with the remainder using your GROBAT with the same weight and length as your game bat. This practice technique optimizes the most important aspects of your hitting game - batspeed, power, and hand-eye coordination!\n\nProper selection of your GROBAT length is important so it can be used for the maximum number of years by your oldest child. It can always be downsized for smaller players coming up.\n\nIf you need a 27\" - 29\" bat ...then order a 30\" GroBat JR.\nIf you need a 30\" - 31\" bat ...then order a 32\" GroBat\nIf you need a 32\" - 34\" bat ...then order a 33\" or 34\"\n\nWeight-Pac & Choke Collar are included with all bats except the GroBat JR (comes with Choke Collar only). Developed and Tested by Chris Richard, Major League Baseball Player. Recommended for use with Wiffle balls ONLY."
