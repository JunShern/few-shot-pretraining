    "text": "State of the Art and Perspectives of *Vibrio* Research in Europe\n================================================================\n\nAccording to the European Environment Agency the rise of global sea surface temperature (SST) is one of the major physical impacts of climate change. However, SST in coastal European seas has increased 4--7 times faster over the past few decades than in the global oceans ([@B59]). This local increase in SST has been linked to outbreaks of *Vibrio*-associated human illness caused by *Vibrio cholerae* non O1-non-O139, *V. parahaemolyticus*, and *V. vulnificus* in several European countries (Table [1](#T1){ref-type=\"table\"}). However, the lack of mandatory notification systems for *Vibrio*-associated illnesses prevents accurate estimates of the number of *Vibrio* infections occurring in Europe. Also mass mortalities of marine animals increase in frequency (Table [1](#T1){ref-type=\"table\"}), particularly in heavily polluted coastal areas, suggesting human activities as a factor favoring disease epidemics. Prominent examples include several *Vibrio* species associated with the recent great devastation of oyster beds in France. The salmonid farming industry is constantly threatened by *V. salmonicida* and *V. anguillarum*. Moreover, different subspecies of *Photobacterium damselae* are associated with diseases in cultured fish species like sole, sea bass, sea bream and turbot, while *V. vulnificus* causes hemorrhagic septicaemia in eel, derbio, tilapia, trout and shrimps but can also cause septicemia in humans. Finally, evidence has accumulated linking *Vibrio* infections (e.g., *V. coralliilyticus*) to increasing mass mortalities of benthic corals (e.g., *Paramuricea clavata*) in the NW Mediterranean Sea.\n\n###### \n\n**Recent Vibrio-associated diseases caused by Vibrio in Europe**.\n\n  **Agent**                                                              **Pathogenic to**                                **Country**                   **References**\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------ ----------------------------- ----------------\n  *V. parahaemolyticus, V. vulnificus and non-O1/non-O139 V. cholerae*   Human                                            Germany                       [@B25]\n  *V. parahaemolyticus*                                                  Human                                            France                        [@B56]\n  *V. parahaemolyticus*                                                  Human                                            Spain                         [@B41]\n  *V. parahaemolyticus*                                                  Human                                            Italy                         [@B49]\n  *V. cholerae*                                                          Human                                            Sweden                        [@B3]\n  *V. cholerae non-O1-non-O139*                                          Human                                            Italy                         [@B48]\n  *V. cholerae non-O1-non-O139*                                          Human                                            Finland                       [@B39]\n  *V. cholerae non-O1-non-O139*                                          Human                                            Poland                        [@B76]\n  *V. cholerae non-O1-non-O139*                                          Human                                            Austria                       [@B26]\n  *V. cholerae non-O1-non-O139*                                          Human                                            Austria                       [@B28]\n  *V. vulnificus*                                                        Human                                            Denmark                       [@B10]\n  *V. vulnificus*                                                        Human                                            Israel                        [@B5]\n  *V. vulnificus*                                                        Human                                            Spain                         [@B78]\n  *V. vulnificus*                                                        Human                                            Turkey                        [@B52]\n  *V. vulnificus*                                                        Human, finfish, crustacean                       USA, Europe, Asia             [@B2]; [@B47]\n  *V. alginolyticus*                                                     Human                                            Guernsey                      [@B58]\n  *Vibrio* spp.                                                          Human                                            North and Baltic Seas         [@B68]\n  *V. coralliilyticus*                                                   Coral                                            Italy                         [@B84]\n  *V. crassostreae*                                                      Oyster                                           France                        [@B32]\n  *V. aestuarianus*                                                      Oyster                                           France                        [@B24]\n  *Harveyi clade*                                                        Finfish, crustaceans, mollusks                   Mediterranean countries       [@B55]\n  *V. anguillarum*                                                       Finfish                                          Northern European countries   [@B20]\n  *Photobacterium damselae* subsp. *Damselae*                            Fish, humans, crustaceans, mollusks, cetaceans   Mediterranean countries       [@B64]\n\nTo cover the large diversity of infectious vibrios, the development of operational tools to identify and detect emergent pathogens is essential to zoosanitary monitoring of cultivated species as well as on wild animal populations. Yet, compared to human pandemic strains, little is known about the virulence mechanisms of emergent environmental vibrios. This lack of knowledge may be attributed to the high genetic diversity of *Vibrio* isolates and the diversity/plurality of virulence mechanisms. To date pathogenic capacity cannot be inferred by taxonomic affiliation, because virulence factors (e.g., secretion systems, toxins) are rarely species-specific and are often shared between *Vibrio* species by lateral gene transfer. On top of that there are very few animal models to distinguish pathogenic strains and extend our understanding of the mechanisms involved in host-microbe interactions. Hence the elucidation of virulence for agent and target is a prerequisite to develop prophylactic methods to fight infectious diseases.\n\nDue to the extent of the environmental, economical, and public health consequences resulting from *Vibrio* infections, a large scientific community is working on these bacteria in Europe. In order to join fundamental and applied research teams and to investigate the emergence of pathogens in natural *Vibrio* populations, we organized the first European workshop dedicated to the research on vibrios in Paris (11--12th March 2015), that provided a forum for experts in *Vibrio* ecology, evolution and pathogenesis to address societal issues involving ocean health and food security.\n\n*Vibrio* Spread in Europe linked with climate change\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nVibrios preferentially grow in warm (\\>15\u00b0C) saline aquatic environments. Warming of marine and saline inland waters is likely to support larger numbers of *Vibrio* populations and consequently an increased risk of *Vibrio* infections. An increase in the prevalence of human infections caused by *V. parahaemolyticus*, *V. cholerae* non-O1-non-O139 and *V. vulnificus* has been recorded in Europe even at high latitudes ([@B4]). In northern Europe, the increase in reported infections corresponds both in time and space with spikes in domestically-acquired *Vibrio* cases in \"heatwave\" years. Similarly, samples collected in the last 60 years by the continuous plankton recorder (CPR) survey ([@B82]) showed that the genus *Vibrio*, including the human pathogen *V. cholerae*, has increased in prevalence in the last 44 years in the coastal North Sea, and that this increase is correlated with warming SST. Elevated water temperatures might also facilitate the successful invasion of pathogenic variants via food trade ([@B44]), ballast water ([@B16]), travelers ([@B19]) or natural animals. For example, migrating birds may act as vectors of intercontinental transport of *V. cholerae* ([@B83]). The direct comparison of the population structure of *V. cholerae* from a major bird sanctuary (Lake Neusiedl, Austria), with strains collected from six other European countries revealed that several strains in the lake shared the same alleles with other European strains, consistent with pan-European transport between distant ecosystems via birds (A. Kirschner, unpublished data). As a future challenge, macro-ecological studies on the impact of climate change on *Vibrio* persistence and spread in the aquatic environment combined with studies investigating climate change effects on epidemiologically relevant variables, such as host susceptibility and exposure are needed to significantly improve prediction and mitigation strategies against the future occurrence of *Vibrio* disease outbreaks.\n\nVirulence as a Function of Biotic Interactions With Host and Microbiome\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nVirulence is a widespread phenomenon across the *Vibrio* phylogeny ([@B85]). Its expression critically depends on biotic interactions with the host but also with other resident microbiota. On the host side, spatially-structured cross-infection experiments indicated that virulence of only distantly related *Vibrio* strains was lower when infecting oysters from the same geographic location. This suggests that oyster hosts are locally adapted and have evolved resistance to genetic factors shared within *Vibrio* populations ([@B86]). When considering interactions of *Vibrio* with the resident microbiome, the hemolymph microbiome modulates infections but is vulnerable to environmental disturbance ([@B38]). Accordingly, *Vibrio* disease cannot be seen as an isolated event but needs to be considered in the context of the microbiome, which includes other non-virulent *Vibrio.* Indeed, the successive replacement of non-virulent with virulent strains during oyster infections occurs in the natural environment ([@B32]) and the amplification of virulence in the presence of non-virulent strains suggests that also non-virulent strains contribute directly or indirectly to the development of disease. Future research on *Vibrio* disease should therefore focus on the higher order biotic interactions between the environment, the host and the pathogenic as well as the non-pathogenic fractions of microbial communities.\n\nA key feature of the interaction between microbes within a community is the production of molecules that determine behavior like antagonism, competition or cooperation. Cell-to-cell communication in vibrios coordinates virulence gene expression based on the biotic and abiotic environment ([@B11]). For example, the three-channel quorum sensing (QS) system of *V. harveyi* controls the pathogenicity of the bacterium toward different aquatic hosts ([@B13]; [@B51]), and our most recent research revealed that another signaling molecule, indole, controls the virulence of *V. anguillarum* toward sea bass larvae ([@B35]). Another potential signaling mechanism has been described based on the production and release of high concentrations of D-amino acids into the extracellular milieu ([@B30]). First discovered in *V. cholerae*, these D-amino acids are different from those known to be part of the cell wall in bacteria (D-Ala and D-Glu) and were therefore called non-canonical D-amino acids (NCDAAs; [@B8]). NCDAAs released into the media by producer strains can affect non-producer organisms beneficially or detrimentally in a particular niche ([@B9]; [@B1]). The possible implications of NCDAAs in the biological processes of co-inhabitants still remains to be investigated but the enormous energy demand suggests that these molecules should have a great impact in poly-microbial communities. Finally several strains of *Vibrio* have been demonstrated to produce potent antibacterial agents (andrimid and holomycin) or agents that block QS regulated genes (solonamides, ngercheumicin) in human pathogens ([@B87]; [@B40]; [@B29]; [@B46]). Comparative and functional genomics using software like antiSMASH ([@B42]) could identify the genetic determinants of these secondary metabolites (polyketide synthases and non-ribosomal peptide synthetases). Hence further elucidation of virulence regulatory mechanisms will enable us to better understand *Vibrio*-host interactions and ecology, and to identify targets for the design of novel agents to control disease caused by vibrios.\n\nHorizontal Gene Transfer, Genome Plasticity, and Chromosome Partitioning\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEvolution of *Vibrio* species is often driven by mobile genetic elements via horizontal gene transfer (HGT). However, very little is known about HGT in environmental *Vibrio* isolates infecting marine organisms. In 75 marine *Vibrio* spp. isolated from the broad-nosed pipefish, *Syngnathus typhle*, associated prophages were characterized and the virulence of strains carrying different prophages was then assessed by comparing the relative expression of 44 immune genes during controlled infection experiments on juvenile pipefish. Preliminary results suggest that virulence is significantly influenced by the associated prophages, further supporting a role for bacteriophages in manipulating the virulence of environmental *Vibrio* isolates (C. Wendling unpublished data).\n\nVirulence of *V. vulnificus* and *P. damselae* subsp. *damselae* in fish is determined by transferable plasmids (pVvbt2 in *V. vulnificus* and pPHDD1 in *P. damselae*). pVvbt2 contains two highly conserved virulence genes involved in serum resistance (*vep07*) and the ability to grow from eel transferrin (*vep20*) ([@B50]). Interestingly, pPHDD1 also contains *vep07* and *vep20* homologs suggesting that both genes are involved in resistance to fish innate immunity. pVvbt2 also encodes RtxA1~3~, a toxin belonging to MARTX (multifunctional, autoprocessive, repeat in toxin) family. RtxA1~3~ is considered a host-non-specific virulence factor because it is involved in resistance to phagocytosis by murine and human phagocytes as well as in eel death ([@B31]). The other virulence plasmid, pPHDD1, encodes phospholipase-D damselysin (Dly) and the pore-forming toxin HlyA~*pl*~ ([@B62]). A second HlyA (HlyA~*ch*~) is encoded in chromosome I ([@B63], [@B65]) and the three toxins contribute to hemolysis and virulence, and are secreted by a type-two secretion system ([@B66]). While the two HlyA hemolysis produce an additive effect, Dly and any of the two HlyA interact in a synergistic manner, being responsible for maximal virulence for fish and for mice ([@B63]). Due to their host range and their duality as pathogens for both poikilotherm and homeotherm animals, *P. damselae* and *V. vulnificus* constitute valuable biological models to study the role of mobile genetic elements in the rise of novel pathogenic strategies.\n\nVibrios contain large chromosomal integrons ([@B7]) and belong to the group of naturally competent bacteria, which allows them to absorb free DNA from their surrounding environment and recombine it into their genome ([@B69]). For *V. cholerae*, entry into competence is tightly regulated and requires growth to high cell densities on chitinous surfaces ([@B43]; [@B36], [@B37]). Uptake of external DNA is accomplished by a sophisticated DNA-uptake machinery ([@B70], [@B71]; [@B72]). As the competence regulon also encompasses the type VI secretion system-encoding gene clusters, HGT is enhanced through deliberate killing of neighboring non-sibling cells followed by the transfer of their DNA ([@B6]).\n\nThe presence of two chromosomes is another characteristic feature of vibrios. While distinctive localization patterns have been described for the two chromosomes, the selective advantages brought by this bipartite architecture are still under debate ([@B79], [@B80]). Replication of both chromosomes is tightly coupled so that replication termination is synchronized ([@B57]). Moreover, the chromosomal position of genes determines the relative copy number during growth thereby impacting the bacteriums physiology ([@B75]). Notably, mechanistic aspects of chromosome organization, architecture, and cell cycle-dependent dynamics are only starting to be deciphered ([@B88]; [@B14]). The elucidation of the mechanisms that coordinate the interplay between chromosomes, accessory replicons, mobile DNA and HGT mechanisms is essential to better apprehend the evolution and niche adaptation of *Vibrio* species.\n\nAdaptation of Pathogenic Vibrios to Intracellular Life\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe pathogenic *V. tasmaniensis* strain LGP32, a member of the *V. splendidus* clade ([@B22]) was found to be a facultative intracellular pathogen of oyster immune cells called hemocytes ([@B18]). This is a rare example of *Vibrio* adapted to intracellular life. The virulence of LGP32 in oysters correlated with the ability to enter hemocytes ([@B17], [@B18]). Both cellular invasion and pathogenicity depend on the major outer membrane protein OmpU, which serves as an adhesin to invade host cells. Once inside the phagosome, LGP32 releases outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) that protect the organism against antimicrobial peptides and act as vehicles for the delivery of virulence factors ([@B15]; [@B81]). Moreover, entry into hemocytes and intracellular survival of LGP32 are required for expression of LGP32 cytotoxicity toward hemocytes. This capacity to survive intracellularly relies on potent antioxidant and copper tolerance responses, both of which are highly induced in the hostile environment of the phagosome.\n\nSmall regulatory RNAs have been shown to play important roles in regulating virulence gene expression in response to conditions encountered in the host. sRNAs present in multicopies such as Qrrs and CsrBs were found in several *Vibrio* spp. to mediate QS regulation of virulence gene expression ([@B45]). One peculiarity of the *Splendidus* clade seems to be the presence of four highly expressed copies of the CsrB sRNAs in their genome, instead of 2--3 found in other vibrios ([@B33]; [@B77]). CsrB sRNAs are highly transcribed inside oyster hemocytes suggesting a role in adaptation to the intracellular environment (Vanhove et al., submitted). The landscape and phylogeny of putative sRNAs encoded by LGP32 demonstrate rapid vertical evolution, with a vast majority of sRNAs being species/strain specific, and only a small number (28/250) conserved in all *Vibrio* sequenced so far ([@B77]). Thus, sRNAs contribute to a high diversity between species and provide opportunities for adaptation/colonization of new hosts and virulence emergence, a question that will be tackled by comparative functional studies of conserved *Vibrio* sRNAs.\n\nModel Systems to Study Pathogenicity Mechanisms and *Vibrio*-host Interactions\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMicrobiologists are increasingly aware that how organisms behave *in situ* in the \"real world\" might be distinct from those that occur in laboratory monocultures grown under tightly controlled conditions ([@B74]). Thus, model systems, which replicate at least part of the natural processes of infection, are needed in order to examine the relevance and biological impact of *in vitro* findings. *In vivo* models that reproduce the main clinical and pathological signs of disease seen following the consumption of contaminated food or water, are available for toxigenic and non-toxigenic *V. cholerae*, and for *V. parahaemolyticus* ([@B60], [@B61]; [@B73]). In these studies, a combination of microbiological, histological and genetic analysis was used to identify key virulence factors and the pathologic mechanisms associated with the respective strains (e.g., see [@B89], [@B90]). However, a growing number of *Vibrio*-associated illnesses are associated with a diverse group of strains, some of which lack known virulence factors ([@B21]; [@B27]; [@B49]). A future challenge will be to examine the pathogenesis of these strains and identify additional virulence markers, which should be used to improve risk assessment tools targeted to the different pathogens. Furthermore, a growing number of human *Vibrio* infections in Europe were not food-borne, but instead associated with the ability of non-O1-non-O139 *V. cholerae*, *V. parahaemolyticus*, or *V. vulnificus* to cause septicemia via wound infections (Table [1](#T1){ref-type=\"table\"}). Models to examine this aspect of their pathogenicity are currently lacking and should become a high priority given the poor prognosis of individuals acquiring this type of infection.\n\nNext to models for human pathogens there is also an increasing need for aquatic animal models. However, studies aimed at investigating the pathogenicity mechanisms in aquatic hosts are often confounded by the presence of the natural microbiota (which usually contains *Vibrio* spp.). Gnotobiotic animals provide researchers with a means to examine host-microbe interactions without interference or influence from unknown microbiota ([@B23]). A model based on the use of gnotobiotic 1-day old larvae of brine shrimp (*Artemia franciscana*) has been recently developed to study *V. campbellii*, *V. harveyi*, or *V. anguillarum* pathogenesis ([@B12]). An alternative model system for *V. anguillarum* involves the use of gnotobiotic European sea bass (*Dicentrarchus labrax*) larvae, where survival is monitored over 1 week ([@B34]). Finally, specific-pathogen-free (SPF) juveniles of *C. gigas* ([@B54], [@B53]) have been developed to investigate the diversity and dynamics of microbial populations in an oceanic environment during disease. When combined with methods to monitor gene expression and activity of vibrios during infection (e.g., [@B67]; [@B13]), a better understanding of the infection process(es) will emerge.\n\nConclusion\n==========\n\nThis workshop clearly demonstrated the importance of vibrios to our understanding of emergent diseases in marine and inland aquatic ecosystems as well as their potential impact on society. The rising frequency of disease events not only affects humans directly but also indirectly by reducing food security and ecosystem health. The synergistic investigation of mechanistic and ecological processes contributing to disease is therefore paramount for our understanding of the larger scale consequences of changing *Vibrio* populations. A better understanding of *Vibrio* ecology is pivotal for the development of prevention and mitigation strategies. In addition, the mechanistic knowledge of virulence regulatory mechanisms could ultimately be used to inhibit disease. However, these tasks are complicated by the high diversity present within *Vibrio* populations, and the fact that biotic interactions within and between microbial communities, modify disease expression on different levels. Therefore, we have to consider *Vibrio* disease as an emergent, multi-faceted phenomenon that will require experimental model systems covering molecules to whole organisms. Expertise for most of these crucial challenges already exists and became united at the workshop under the European umbrella of *Vibrio* research thereby fostering a more productive combination of basic and applied research in the future (Figure [1](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}).\n\n![**Perspectives of the European ***Vibrio*** network. (A)** Sharing of common tools and databases. Large-scale sampling for *Vibrio* collection in the environment and retrospective analysis of *Vibrio* populations could be improved using the continuous plankton recorder (CPR) technology and the historical CPR archive. An \"encyclopedia of *Vibrio* genome sequences\" could be developed by the Genoscope (Evry, France) allowing access for the community to the Microbial genome annotation and analysis platform (MAGE). A genetic resource center, initially created under the scope of EMBRC France, could be improved thanks to other teams performing genetic development. Several teams developing *in vivo* and *in vitro* models to investigate host-*Vibrio* interactions as well as structural biology were also identified. Training sessions (such as summer schools) in the field of bioinformatics or microbial genetics could be organized. **(B)** Collaborations addressing specific questions have already been stimulated by the workshop.](fmicb-06-00830-g0001){#F1}\n\nConflict of Interest Statement\n------------------------------\n\nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\nWe warmly thank EUROMARINE, EMBRC-France, the Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) for their financial support and EFOR organization to this first workshop.\n\n[^1]: Edited by: *Maurizio Labbate, University of Technology, Sydney, Australia*\n\n[^2]: Reviewed by: *Daniela Ceccarelli, University of Maryland, USA; Yan Boucher, University of Alberta, Canada; Fabiano Thompson, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil*\n\n[^3]: This article was submitted to Aquatic Microbiology, a section of the journal Frontiers in Microbiology.\n"
