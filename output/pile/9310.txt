    "text": "American Action Network/American Action Forum\n\nPosted on\nFebruary 26, 2014 | Updated on May 16, 2014\n\nPolitical leanings: GOP/center-right\n\nSpending target: Unknown\n\nThe American Action Network \u2014 a self-described \u201caction tank\u201d that advocates for \u201ccenter-right policies\u201d \u2014 was founded in February 2010 before the midterm congressional elections. It was started by Norm Coleman, a former Republican senator from Minnesota, and Fred Malek, a longtime Republican fundraiser and strategist.\n\nMalek is the founder and co-chairman of Thayer Lodging Group, a hotel investment firm. He also was the founder of Thayer Capital Partners, a private equity firm now managed by HCI Equity. Coleman serves as the group\u2019s chairman, and Malek sits on the board of directors. Brian O. Walsh, who previously worked as a senior strategist for the National Republican Congressional Committee in 2009-2010, is the group\u2019s president.\n\nThe American Action Network is a 501(c)(4) organization and, therefore, does not have to disclose its donors. The group raised $22.6 million in the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2012, and $24.4 million from July 1, 2012 through June 30, 2013. Federal Election Commission records indicate that the American Action Network spent $11.1 million during the 2012 campaign on TV ads and other independent expenditures \u2014 placing it among the top 25 biggest outside spenders in that campaign cycle. But that was down from nearly $19 million in the 2010 cycle \u2014 the third highest amount spent in that cycle.\n\nFor the 2014 campaign cycle, American Action Network is again focusing on House races and, again, on Shea-Porter, the New Hampshire congresswoman.\n\nIn November 2013, the AAN spent $200,000 on a direct-mail campaign to seniors in three congressional districts. The organization stated that the mail campaign was intended to \u201ceducat[e] area seniors on how Obamacare is leading to higher costs, fewer jobs, and reduced access to care.\u201d This was followed by two online ad campaigns in December2013 with similar anti-ACA messages. Shea-Porter was the only member of Congress targeted by all three ad campaigns.\n\nThe American Action Network\u2019s policy arm and \u201csister organization,\u201d the American Action Forum, is a 501(c)(3) organization and is also exempt from disclosing its donors. Douglas Holtz-Eakin, previously a senior policy adviser for John McCain\u2019s 2008 presidential run, is the forum\u2019s current president. Malek also serves as the group\u2019s chairman. Other members of American Action Forum leadership include former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and former Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao. Chao is now a distinguished fellow at the Heritage Foundation. She is also married to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nTax records indicate that the American Action Forum raised $4.9 million in the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2012, and spent an equal amount during that time on \u201cpolicy research and education.\u201d The group\u2019s website contains information on a number of topics, including the Affordable Care Act, minimum wage and immigration reform. FEC records show American Action Forum spent no money on independent expenditures in 2010 or 2012.\n\nRelated Posts\n\nAsk FactCheck\n\nQ: Will people living in the U.S. illegally receive \u201camnesty bonuses\u201d because of President Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration? A: There is no automatic payment, but some working immigrants could claim up to four years of earned income tax credits if they meet eligibility requirements."
