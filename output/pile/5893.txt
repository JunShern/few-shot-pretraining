    "text": "Introduction {#S1}\n============\n\nSelf-renewal is the process by which cells make more of themselves and has been ascribed to both normal and malignant stem cell populations ([@R16]; [@R20]). In many cancers, tumor cells are hierarchically organized, with a distinct population of undifferentiated cells exclusively retaining self-renewal and long-term growth potential---these cells are commonly called tumor-propagating cells (TPCs). TPCs are often refractory to conventional chemotherapies, thereby leading to relapse and metastasis ([@R1]). While molecularly defined TPCs have now been identified in many cancers ([@R1]; [@R8]; [@R28]), the molecular pathways that drive cancer stemness, self-renewal, and differentiation arrest are not well understood.\n\nRhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a common pediatric malignancy that shares morphologic and molecular features with embryonic skeletal muscle ([@R30]). RAS is a major oncogenic driver of the embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS) subtype, with \\>90% of patients having activation of this pathway ([@R4]; [@R13]; [@R24]). However, additional pathways are likely required for eliciting full transformation and imparting self-renewal to transformed cells. To date, only a single paper in the literature has defined acquired oncogenic pathways in regulating stem cell pathways in human ERMS, defining important roles for the Hedgehog signaling pathway in regulating TPC number in ERMS ([@R23]). However, despite this pathway being turned on in a fraction of human ERMS, activating mutations in the Hedgehog pathway are uncommon, and the extent to which this pathway contributes to ERMS to drive continued tumor growth by modulating TPC number is under active investigation. As with other tumors that sustain long-term growth through TPCs, it is likely that additional pathways regulate TPC number, growth, and maintenance in human rhabdomyosarcoma.\n\nZebrafish have become an important animal model to uncover evolutionarily conserved pathways that regulate rhabdomyosarcoma growth, TPC cell number, and self-renewal ([@R5]; [@R8]; [@R13]; reviewed in [@R10]). Using transgenic approaches, we have generated zebrafish that develop embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma that are molecularly and histopathologically similar to human disease ([@R13]). The zebrafish model has also been used to assess tumor cell heterogeneity and to identify functions of molecularly defined cell fractions in driving tumor growth. For example, zebrafish can be created that express fluorescent proteins under control of muscle-specific promoters that are active only during specific states of muscle cell maturation ([@R8]). Using this approach, we have uncovered that *myf5:GFP+/mylz2-mCherry-negative* TPCs share similar characteristics with normal muscle satellite cells, can sustain tumor growth, and are regulated by similar molecular pathways ([@R5]; [@R8]; [@R13]; reviewed in [@R10]).\n\nBuilding on our knowledge that muscle development, regeneration, and stem cell self-renewal are regulated by the NOTCH1 pathway ([@R6]; [@R11]), we undertook experiments to assess a role for NOTCH1 in regulating human rhabdomyosarcoma growth through specifically affecting TPCs. Our work uncovered important roles for intracellular NOTCH1 (ICN1) signaling in regulating self-renewal, differentiation arrest, and growth in zebrafish, mouse xenografts, and human cell culture. Functional studies showed that SNAIL1 *(SNAI1)* is activated downstream of *ICN1* in human ERMS and stimulated self-renewal and growth, in part, by repressing expression of the muscle differentiation transcription factor *MEF2C*. Our data provide a mechanism by which oncogenic NOTCH1 regulates the overall number and properties of tumor-sustaining cell types in ERMS and provides therapeutic targets for this disease.\n\nResults {#S2}\n=======\n\nThe Notch1 Pathway Expands the Number of TPCs in Zebrafish ERMS {#S3}\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo assess a role for *NOTCH1* signaling in ERMS, we compared zebrafish ERMS cells that express *kRASG12D* with those that co-express both *kRASG12D* and *intracellular-activated NOTCH1* (*ICN1*)([Figures 1A and 1B](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Gene expression analysis confirmed that transgenic *ICN1* was expressed at physiological levels found in normal development ([Figure S1A](#SD1){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). Primary ERMS onset, penetrance, and tumor size did not differ between tumors arising in *kRASG12D* or *kRASG12D+ICN1*-expressing fish ([Figures 1C and 1D](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}). However, following the cell transplantation of equal numbers of ERMS cells into syngeneic CG1 recipients (1 \u00d7 10^4^ cells per fish), fluorescent-labeled *ICN1-*expressing tumors grew qualitatively faster and had increased penetrance of disease ([Figures 1E--1G](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}; p = 0.012, log-rank/Mantel-Cox test). *ICN1*-expressing ERMS also expressed significantly higher levels of muscle stem cell genes, including *myf5*, *pax7a*, and *c-met* ([Figure 1H](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}). This gene signature is highly and specifically expressed in the *myf5-GFP+* ERMS TPCs ([@R8]). *ICN1*-expressing ERMS also exhibited a 23-fold increase in TPCs when assessed by bulk limit dilution cell transplantation into syngeneic recipient animals ([Table S1](#SD1){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}; n = 4 tumors per group; p \\< 0.000001, extreme limiting dilution analysis \\[ELDA\\]). Our results have uncovered a dominant role for *NOTCH1* signaling in elevating the TPC number in zebrafish *kRASG12D*-induced ERMS.\n\nOne explanation of our results is that *ICN1* may expand the number of previously defined *myf5-GFP+* TPCs ([@R8]). To directly test this hypothesis, we generated ERMS in syngeneic *myf5-GFP/mylz2-mCherry* transgenic fish. These fluorescent transgenic lines have been previously used to show that tumor-propagating activity is exclusively confined to the *myf5-GFP+/mylz2-negative* ERMS cells ([@R8]). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis revealed that primary *ICN1*-expressing ERMS had a 3-fold increase in the numbers of *myf5-GFP+/mylz2-negative* cells while also decreasing the more differentiated *mylz2-mcherry+* ERMS cells ([Figures 1I--1P](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}; n = 5 tumors per group; p = 0.013, Student\\'s t test). Similar results were observed in ERMS that developed in transplant recipient fish ([Figures 1Q--1V](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}; n = 5 independent tumors per group; p \\< 0.001, Student\\'s t test). Importantly, the *myf5-GFP+/mylz2-negative* ERMS cells continued to retain tumor-propagating activity when assessed by limiting dilution cell transplantation ([Figure 2H](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}; [Table S2](#SD1){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). Thus, ICN1 pathway activation expands the number of classically defined *myf5-GFP+/mylz2-negative* TPCs that have been previously shown to drive the growth of zebrafish *kRASG12D*-induced ERMS ([@R8]).\n\n*ICN1* Confers Tumor-Propagating Activity to Mid-differentiated ERMS Cells {#S4}\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*ICN1* increased molecularly defined *myf5-GFP+/mylz2-negative* TPCs 3-fold when compared with tumors that express only *kRASG12D*, yet *ICN1*-expressing ERMS cells had a 23-fold increase in TPCs when assessed by limiting dilution cell transplantation. These data suggested that *ICN1* could confer tumor-propagating ability to more differentiated ERMS cells. Mid-differentiated *myf5-GFP+/mylz2-mcherry+* ERMS from *ICN1*-expressing tumors expressed early muscle progenitor markers, including *myf5*, *c-met*, and *m-cadherin* yet retained more differentiated muscle gene expression, including *myoD*, *myogenin*, *mylz2*, *tnni2a*, *actc1b*,and *myh9a* ([Figures S1B--S1N](#SD1){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). We had previously shown that proliferation largely resided in the *myf5-GFP+/mylz2-mCherry*-*negative* ERMS population in *kRASG12D*-driven ERMS ([@R8]). By contrast, both the *myf5-GFP+/mylz2-mCherry*-*negative* and the mid-differentiated, double-positive cells from *ICN1*-expressing ERMS were highly proliferative when assessed for EDU incorporation following a 6-hr pulse ([Figures S1S--S1U](#SD1){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). These data suggest that mid-differentiated cells likely drive continued tumor growth in ICN1-expressing ERMS and that TPC function could be imparted to more differentiated ERMS cells.\n\nTo directly assess whether more differentiated ICN1-expressing ERMS cells had gained tumor-propagating potential, highly purified ERMS sub-populations were isolated by FACS and implanted into syngeneic recipient fish at limiting dilution (purity \\> 86.6%, and viability \\> 86.9%; [Figure 2A](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Consistent with previous findings ([@R8]), the *myf5-GFP+/mylz2-mCherry*-*negative* ERMS sub-population engrafted into recipient fish with no differences in engraftment frequencies between *kRASG12D* and *kRASG12D + ICN1*-expressing tumors ([Figures 2B--2D, 2H](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}, and [S2A--S2E; Table S2](#SD1){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}; n = 5 tumors analyzed). By contrast, the mid-differentiated *myf5-GFP+/mylz2-mCherry+ ICN1-*expressing ERMS cells could also now robustly engraft a tumor (p \\< 0.01; [Figures 2E--2H](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"} and [S2F-- S2J; Table S2](#SD1){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). Serial transplantation experiments confirmed that both ICN1-expressing ERMS cell populations had long-term engraftment capacity ([Figures S2F--S2P; Table S2](#SD1){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}).\n\nOne potential cellular mechanism by which mid-differentiated ERMS cells can drive tumor growth is to undergo de-differentiation and become classically defined *myf5-GFP+/mylz2-mcherry-negative* self-renewing TPCs. To test this possibility, we isolated highly purified mid-differentiated *myf5-GFP+/mylz2-mCherry+* ERMS cells (97.5% sort purity, \\>95% viable) and transplanted 10--20 cells into recipient fish. The calculated probability of en-grafting a tumor from a single TPC was calculated at \\>99.7% ([Table S3](#SD1){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). Sort purity was independently confirmed by confocal microscopy (n = 100 of 100 tumor cells were G+R+ \\[*myf5-GFP+/mylz2-mCherry+*\\]), obviating the possibility of contamination by classically defined *myf5-GFP+/mylz2-mCherry-negative* TPCs. Highly purified double-positive ERMS cells engrafted robustly and made ERMS tumors that contained all fluorescent tumor cell subfractions, including the less differentiated *myf5-GFP+/mylz2-mCherry-negative* ERMS cells (n = 3 of 3; [Figures S2Q-- S2V; Table S3](#SD1){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). Taken together, we conclude that *ICN1* imparts tumor-propagating potential to mid-differentiated cells and enables these same cells to oscillate between cellular states, leading to the production of less differentiated ERMS cells that can self-renew and drive tumor growth.\n\nNOTCH1 Regulates Cell Growth, Self-Renewal, and Differentiation in Human ERMS {#S5}\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo extend our findings to human ERMS, we first analyzed transcript expression of *NOTCH1* in primary patient tumors and uncovered that *NOTCH1* was highly expressed in 60% of both human alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS) and ERMS when compared with normal muscle controls ([Figure 3A](#F3){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Importantly, transcript expression of well-known downstream targets of NOTCH1 was also concordantly deregulated, including *NOTCH3*, *HEY1*, and *JAGGED1* ([Figures S3A--S3D](#SD1){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). Real-time qPCR of primary human rhabdomyosarcoma independently confirmed that *NOTCH1* was highly expressed in a majority of tumors (n = 8 of 12 samples expressed a \\>4-fold increase in *NOTCH1* when compared with normal muscle; [Figure 3B](#F3){ref-type=\"fig\"}; [Table S4](#SD1){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). Next, ICN1 protein expression was assessed in a panel of human rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines, and we uncovered that all rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines expressed activated ICN1 to varying degrees (n = 9; [Figure 4C](#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Finally, high *NOTCH1* expression was associated with reduced survival and poor outcome in human rhabdomyosarcoma patients (p = 0.013, log-rank statistic; [Figure 3C](#F3){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Rhabdomyosarcoma subtypes also exhibited a trend toward worse outcome based on high NOTCH1 expression ([Figures S3E and S3F](#SD1){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}), yet these analyses failed to reach statistical significance due to small sample sizes. We conclude that *NOTCH1* signaling is found in a large fraction of human ERMS, likely identifying a group of high-risk patients.\n\nTo test the function of *ICN1* in human ERMS, we next performed knockdown of NOTCH1 using three different short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) in RD and SMS-CTR cell lines, both of which are ERMS, have activating RAS mutations, and express high levels of ICN1 ([Figures 3D--3H](#F3){ref-type=\"fig\"} and [S3G--S3J](#SD1){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). All three shRNA constructs reduced ICN1 expression ([Figures 3D](#F3){ref-type=\"fig\"} and [S3G](#SD1){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). shRNA knockdown that reduced ICN1 expression by 90% led to loss of proliferation and cell death in RD lines ([Figure 3H](#F3){ref-type=\"fig\"}). By contrast, knockdown of ICN1 using two additional shRNAs resulted in 41%--71% reduction in ICN1 protein expression, yet it had significant effects on reducing growth ([Figures 3F, 3G](#F3){ref-type=\"fig\"}, and [S3H--S3J](#SD1){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). Following stable knockdown of ICN1 using these two shRNAs, both RD and SMS-CTR cells acquired morphological and gene expression changes associated with differentiation, while scrambled shRNA controls had no effect ([Figures 3I--3M](#F3){ref-type=\"fig\"} and [S3K](#SD1){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). These results are consistent with those reported previously by the C.M.L. group who identified roles for NOTCH1 in regulating differentiation arrest in human rhabdomyosarcoma ([@R2]).\n\nTo test the role of ICN1 on regulating TPC number, we next used sphere formation assays under minimal growth factor conditions, a surrogate for assessing tumor-propagating activity in vivo ([@R28]). Knockdown of NOTCH1 with two independent shRNAs resulted in significantly reduced sphere formation in both RD and SMS-CTR cells (p \\< 0.01, Student\\'s t test; [Figures 3N--3Q](#F3){ref-type=\"fig\"} and [S3L--S3N](#SD1){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). Furthermore, pharmacologic inhibition of NOTCH1 using the gamma-secretase inhibitor dibenzaze-pine (DBZ) reduced sphere formation in a human PDX ERMS (p \\< 0.05, Student\\'s t test; [Figure 3R](#F3){ref-type=\"fig\"}). These results were independently confirmed in RD cells, where DBZ treatment reduced ICN1 protein expression ([Figure 3S](#F3){ref-type=\"fig\"}, bottom), enhanced differentiation as assessed by myosin heavy-chain (MF20) staining ([Figures S3P--S3R](#SD1){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}), and reduced colony formation following 10 days of drug treatment (p \\< 0.001, Student\\'s t test; [Figure 3W](#F3){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Conversely, gain-of-function experiments using constitutively active NOTCH1\u0394E resulted in a 10-fold increase in sphere-forming ability in RD cells ([Figures 3S, 3U, and 3W](#F3){ref-type=\"fig\"}; p \\< 0.001, Student\\'s t test). Because the membrane-bound NOTCH1\u0394E requires cleavage by \u03b3-secretase to become activated, we verified the specificity of our results by treating these cells with DBZ. DBZ treatment reduced sphere colony formation back to near-wild-type DMSO-treated control cells (p \\< 0.0001, Student\\'s t test; [Figures 3V and 3W](#F3){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Our results establish a major role for the NOTCH1 signaling pathway in regulating TPC function and growth in human ERMS, consistent with our findings from the zebrafish model.\n\n*NOTCH1* Regulates *SNAI1* to Modulate TPC Function in Human ERMS {#S6}\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGene expression studies were completed to identify potential downstream targets of *ICN1*. Not surprisingly, a subset of known *NOTCH1* target genes were reduced following shRNA knockdown of *ICN1* in both RD and SMS-CTR cell lines (*NOTCH3*, p = 0.001; *HEY1*, p = 0.02; and *JAGGED1*, p = 0.001, Student\\'s t test; [Figures 4A](#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"} and [S4A](#SD1){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}) ([@R2]; [@R22]). *SNAI1*, *SNAI2*, and *SOX9* were also highly expressed in ERMS tumors and cell lines, compared to normal muscle; however, only *SNAI1* mRNA and protein expression were reproducibly reduced following shRNA knockdown in both RD and SMS-CTR cells ([Figures 4A, 4B](#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}, [S4A, and S4B](#SD1){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). Transcriptional analysis of zebrafish ERMS had previously shown that *snai1a* and *snai2* were highly and specifically expressed in the TPC cell population in RAS-driven ERMS ([@R13]). These same factors were also upregulated in ICN1-expressing ERMS and were highly expressed in both the *myf5-GFP+/mylz2-mCherry*-*negative* and mid-differentiated *myf5-GFPmylz2-mCherry+* subpopulations in ICN1+ ERMS ([Figures S1Q and S1R](#SD1){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}) ([@R13]). Since *SNAI1-*related family members have been implicated in regulating self-renewal in both normal and malignant stem cells in the breast epithelium ([@R15]; [@R31]), we reasoned that these factors might be downstream targets of ICN1 and regulate self-renewal in human ERMS.\n\nRemarkably, rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines expressing high ICN1 also co-expressed high SNAI1 protein, correlating well with graded gene expression between the two factors ([Figure 4C](#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Gene expression analysis also uncovered a high correlation of *SNAI1* and *NOTCH1* transcript co-expression in human primary rhabdomyosarcoma ([Figure 4D](#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}; p \\< 0.0001; Pearson correlation, 0.604). This correlation was even higher than well-known *NOTCH1* target genes *NOTCH3* and *HEY1* ([Figure 4D](#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Additional gene expression studies confirmed that high-*NOTCH1*-expressing primary tumors also had high *SNAI1* ([Figure 4E](#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}; n = 8 of 8). Finally, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments showed that *SNAI1* was a direct transcriptional target of NOTCH1, with NOTCH1 binding enriched \\>15-fold within a 1-kb region upstream of the *SNAI1* promoter ([Figure 4F](#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}; p \\< 0.01).\n\nWe also assessed whether *NOTCH1* signaling was correlated with Hedgehog and canonical WNT/b-catenin signaling pathways previously shown to be associated with stemness and differentiation in rhabdomyosarcoma ([@R5]; [@R23]; [@R33]). We found that *NOTCH1* transcript expression highly correlated with *GLI3* and, to a lesser extent, with *GLI1*; however, *NOTCH1* expression did not correlate with either *PTCH1* or *PTCH2*, or with Hedgehog-associated embryonic stem cell gene *NANOG*, suggesting that Notch and Hedgehog programs may regulate distinct self-renewal programs in rhabdomyosarcoma ([Figures S4D and S4E](#SD1){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). Similarly, there was no correlation between *NOTCH1* and canonical WNT target genes *AXIN2* and *DKK1* or stem cell genes previously identified to drive TPC growth in human rhabdomyosarcoma, including *NANOG*, *POU5F1*,or *SOX2*. Together, these results show that *SNAI1* is a bona fide downstream target of *NOTCH1* in ERMS and suggest non-overlapping roles for the *NOTCH1/SNAI1* axis in regulating stem cell programs that drive tumor growth.\n\nWe next assessed roles for *SNAI1* in regulating ERMS differentiation and self-renewal using shRNA knockdown in both RD and SMS-CTR cells. Similar to NOTCH1 knockdown, SNAI1 loss also resulted in reductions in cell number and acquisition of morphological characteristics associated with differentiation (three independent shRNAs; [Figures 5A--5E](#F5){ref-type=\"fig\"} and [S5A--S5E](#SD1){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). Stable knockdown moderately decreased SNAI1 protein expression ([Figure 5F](#F5){ref-type=\"fig\"}) yet had profound effects on increasing differentiation and reducing ERMS self-renewal in sphere colony formation assays performed in RD cells (p \\< 0.01, Student\\'s t test; [Figures 5F--5N](#F5){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Consistent with *SNAI1* regulating self-renewal, expressing *SNAI1* using tamoxifen-inducible *SNAI1* (SNAI1ERSS) ([@R9]) resulted in enhanced sphere formation (p \\< 0.001, Student\\'s t test; [Figures 5O](#F5){ref-type=\"fig\"} and [S5F--S5H](#SD1){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). Finally, epistasis experiments were completed to show that *SNAI1* is downstream of NOTCH1. For example, stable knockdown of *ICN1* led to increased differentiation in RD and SMS-CTR cells. Following the addition of 4-hydroxytamoxifen and activation of SNAI1ERSS activity in these cells, differentiation was blocked ([Figure S5I](#SD1){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). Similarly, reducing ICN1 levels with DBZ in RD cells resulted in reduced sphere colony formation, which was rescued by activation of the SNAI1ERSS construct ([Figures 5P-5T](#F5){ref-type=\"fig\"} and [S5J](#SD1){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}; p \\< 0.001, Student\\'s t test). These experiments show that *SNAI1* is activated downstream of *NOTCH1* and is required for regulating self-renewal and differentiation of human ERMS.\n\n*NOTCH1* and *SNAI1* Are Required for ERMS Xenograft Growth and Maintenance {#S7}\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGiven that *NOTCH1* and *SNAI1* have potent effects on ERMS self-renewal in vitro, we expected that inactivation of either factor would result in reduced xenograft growth in mice. As expected, knockdown of either *NOTCH1* or *SNAI1* significantly impaired RD xenograft growth when compared with scrambled-control-infected cells ([Figures 6A--6C, 6I--6K](#F6){ref-type=\"fig\"}, [S6A--S6E, and S6F--S6J](#SD1){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}; p \\< 0.001). By 30 days post-transplantation, 9 of 12 *NOTCH1* knockdown tumors had fully regressed, while all control tumors had grown substantially ([Figures 6A and 6B](#F6){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Similarly, knockdown of *SNAI1* in RD cells using two different shRNAs resulted in significantly reduced tumor growth in vivo when assessed by luciferase imaging at 21 days and after tumors were palpable ([Figures 6I--6K](#F6){ref-type=\"fig\"} and [S6F--S6J](#SD1){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}; p \\< 0.001, two-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett\\'s multiple comparisons test).\n\nAt necropsy, tumors isolated from *NOTCH1* and *SNAI1* knockdown xenografts weighed significantly less ([Figures 6C and 6K](#F6){ref-type=\"fig\"}; p \\< 0.001, Student\\'s t test). Tumors were stained by H&E and revealed loss of cellularity in both *ICN1* and *SNAI1* knockdown tumors ([Figures 6D, 6E, 6L, and 6M](#F6){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Further, KI67 staining revealed that both *NOTCH1* and *SNAI1* knockdown tumors were significantly less proliferative when compared to scrambled-control-shRNA-expressing RD cells ([Figures 6F--6H, 6N--6P](#F6){ref-type=\"fig\"}; p \\< 0.002, Student\\'s t test). Together, these data support roles for *ICN1* and *SNAI1* in regulating continued tumor growth and maintenance in vivo.\n\n*MEF2C* Is Repressed by *NOTCH1/SNAI1* Signaling and, when Activated, Leads to ERMS Differentiation and a Loss of Self-Renewal {#S8}\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFinally, we explored the downstream molecular pathways deregulated by *NOTCH1/SNAI1* to uncover how this signaling axis regulates differentiation and self-renewal. [@R14] have elegantly shown that promyogenic factors *JDP2*, *MEF2C*, and *RUNX1* are actively repressed in human ERMS RD cells and, when reactivated, can potently induce differentiation. Remarkably, expression of *RUNX1* and *JDP2* were unaffected by *NOTCH1 or SNAI1* knockdown, while only *MEF2C* was re-expressed ([Figures 7A and 7B](#F7){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Further, gene expression analysis showed that *MEF2C* was expressed at lower levels in both human ERMS and ARMS when compared to normal muscle ([Figure 7C](#F7){ref-type=\"fig\"}; p \\< 0.001, Student\\'s t test). An immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis confirmed that MEF2C was expressed in only a small fraction of human ERMS cells ([Figure 7D](#F7){ref-type=\"fig\"}), yet constitutively active NOTCH1\u0394E could further reduce MEF2C+ cell numbers by 2.5-fold (p \\< 0.01, Student\\'s t test; [Figure 7D](#F7){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Conversely, knockdown of either *NOTCH1 or SNAI1* resulted in increased numbers of MEF2C+ cells when assessed by IHC analysis (p \\< 0.001; [Figures 7E and 7F](#F7){ref-type=\"fig\"}).\n\nTo confirm that MEF2C is a downstream target of the *NOTCH1/SNAI1* signaling axis, epistasis experiments were completed. Knockdown of MEF2C in the setting of NOTCH1 silencing lead to reduced differentiation of ERMS cells (p \\< 0.01, [Figures 7G and 7H](#F7){ref-type=\"fig\"}). To test whether MEF2C was able to modulate differentiation and self-renewal of ERMS, we next engineered cells to express a doxycycline-inducible form of MEF2C. Following the overexpression of MEF2C, RD cells underwent terminal differentiation and expressed high levels of myosin heavy chain ([Figure 7I and 7J](#F7){ref-type=\"fig\"}). MEF2C also had important roles in modulating self-renewal in sphere colony formation assays where elevated MEF2C expression resulted in a 50% reduction in sphere colony formation ([Figure 7K](#F7){ref-type=\"fig\"}; p \\< 0.01, Student\\'s t test). Finally, we performed additional epistasis experiments to show that SNAI1 is downstream of NOTCH1 and regulates MEF2C-induced differentiation ([Figure 7L](#F7){ref-type=\"fig\"}). RD cells expressing a tamoxifen-inducible SNAI1 construct were treated with or without DBZ to suppress NOTCH1 activity. As expected, DBZ reduced ICN1 levels concomitant with elevated differentiation and expression of both MEF2C and myosin heavy chain. Following the reactivation of SNAI1 by treating cells with tamoxifen, differentiation was severely impaired, with reduction in both MEF2C and myosin heavy chain protein expression, indicating that NOTCH1 signaling through SNAI1 leads to the block of ERMS differentiation ([Figure 7L](#F7){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Gene expression analysis of zebrafish ICN1-expressing ERMS also suggested the use of this molecular pathway in regulating differentiation and TPC self-renewal ([Figure S7](#SD1){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). In total, our experiments show that the *NOTCH1/SNAI1* axis suppresses *MEF2C* expression, locking cells in a less differentiated cell state while elevating the overall self-renewal potential of rhabdomyosarcoma.\n\nDiscussion {#S9}\n==========\n\nOnly a single report in the literature has assessed a role for ICN1 in regulating human ERMS growth in vivo, which was largely attributed to regulation of the downstream transcriptional activation of *HEY1* ([@R2]). Despite these studies uncovering important roles for NOTCH1 in regulating rhabdomyosarcoma growth, roles for *NOTCH1* or *HEY1* in regulating stem cell programs that elevate overall numbers of TPCs was not reported. Rather, our work has uncovered prominent oncogenic roles for NOTCH1 in regulating the balance between ERMS self-renewal and differentiation, prominently impacting overall tumor growth. Remarkably, using the exceptional ability of our in vivo zebrafish ERMS model to differentially label ERMS tumor cells based on molecularly defined differentiation states, we also show that NOTCH1 pathway activation can break the rigid muscle stem cell hierarchies and modulate cell-state transitions between TPC and differentiated, non-proliferative cell populations. Importantly, these oscillating cell-state transitions are absent in ERMS expressing *kRAG12D* alone and differ markedly from the well-described roles for Notch1 in regulating symmetric stem cell divisions within the muscle satellite cell pool that increases the overall number of stem cells after injury ([@R6]; [@R11]).\n\nOur in vivo findings that the *NOTCH1* pathway breaks rigid stem cell hierarchies and can modulate cell-state transitions in ERMS was unexpected. Plasticity of the stem cell fate is an uncommon phenomenon, with only a few reports published in normal and malignant contexts. For example, in vivo cell-lineage tracing of intestinal epithelial cells was used to show that differentiated cells can repopulate the stem cell niche only after injury by de-differentiating into stem cells ([@R3]). Similar reports have now been seen in the lung and the liver where NOTCH1 can directly reprogram differentiated cells into less differentiated progenitors that drive regeneration ([@R12]; [@R32]). In melanoma, tumor cells can oscillate between stem-cell-like states by expressing JARIDB ([@R21]), reconciling the lack of cell-surface markers that identify pure populations of TPCs and suggesting that extreme cell-state transitions and plasticity can be found in a subset of cancers ([@R18]). To date, many of these studies lack plausible molecular mechanisms to account for these shifting cell fates. In ERMS, we show that the *NOTCH1/SNAI1/MEF2C* pathway regulates self-renewal and de-differentiation. Further, given the overall high conservation of molecular pathways used in normal and malignant muscle, we posit that ICN1 may have similar roles in de-differentiating myoblasts during injury into functional stem cells.\n\nWe have found that *NOTCH1* transcriptionally regulates *SNAI1*, a neural crest cell and EMT (epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition)-expressed factor whose expression and function in muscle is largely unexplored. Rather surprisingly, we find that *SNAI1* is highly expressed in rhabdomyosarcoma tumors and that knocking it down reduces self-renewal and growth while elevating tumor differentiation. Our understanding of *SNAI1* function is largely defined in neural crest cells, cancers of epithelial origin, and endothelial cells, where it is found to function as a transcriptional repressor that is also a part of chromatin-modifying complexes that regulate cell motility and EMT ([@R17]; [@R26]). However, *SNAI1* and other EMT factors have also been recently implicated in regulating stemness in normal and malignant breast epithelial tissues. For example, [@R15] explored the relationship between EMT factors and stemness in immortalized human mammary epithelial cells and discovered that the EMT program can reinitiate stem cell features, including the ability to form mammo-spheres and to increase efficiency of engraftment in vivo. Building on these findings, [@R7] and [@R31] found that an EMT network directed by *SNAI2* can regulate mammary stem cell properties in vitro and that co-expression of *SNAI2* and *SOX9* in human breast cancer cells enhanced tumorigenic ability and metastatic spread. In addition to regulating stemness and EMT-associated processes in epithelial tumors, our findings point to *SNAI1* function in regulating stemness in ERMS.\n\nIn ERMS, *SNAI1* modulates stem cell self-renewal programs by suppressing the expression of *MEF2C*, a well-known transcriptional activator that binds MYOD-binding sites and is required for robust terminal differentiation of myoblasts ([@R14]). Thus far, only a single report implicates a role for *SNAI1* in regulating *MYOD* transcriptional networks during muscle differentiation. In this report, [@R25] found that SNAI1 preferentially binds at GC-rich E-box elements enriched in differentiating myotubes, thereby competing with MYOD for access to enhancers and promoters that regulate myoblast differentiation. Our work has uncovered unexpected roles for *MEF2C* in blocking self-renewal in addition to enhancing differentiation in human ERMS, suggesting that *MEF2C* acts as a molecular switch that regulates both self-renewal and differentiation programs downstream of *NOTCH1* and *SNAI1*. Indeed, others have shown that *MEF2C* is poorly expressed in human ERMS and, when re-expressed, leads to potent differentiation of RD cells ([@R14]). Thus, it appears that differentiation is not just the default state of rhabdomyosarcoma cells that exit the cell cycle. Rather, once differentiation programs are initiated by MEF2C, self-renewal programs are actively turned off, suggesting important insights into how self-renewal and differentiation programs are reciprocally regulated in muscle and rhabdomyosarcoma growth.\n\nOur results are particularly important, as NOTCH1 inhibitory antibodies are now being assessed in preclinical models that have increased specificity and less gastrointestinal toxicity as pan-g-secretase inhibitors ([@R29]), raising hope that these strategies might be applied to the treatment of rhabdomyosarcoma in the future. Finally, given the importance of *NOTCH1* as an oncogene in other cancers ([@R19]), it is likely that similar effects on self-renewal, stemness, and cell-state transitions will be observed in other Notch-driven tumors.\n\nExperimental Procedures {#S10}\n=======================\n\nAnimals {#S11}\n-------\n\nAnimal studies were approved by the Massachusetts General Hospital Subcommittee on Research Animal Care under protocols \\#2011-N-000127 (zebrafish) and \\#2013N000038 (mouse) and by the Partners Human Research Committee under institutional review board (IRB) protocol \\#2009-P-002756 (human).\n\nZebrafish used in this work include: CG1 strain, *myf5*-GFP transgenic zebrafish, *myf5-GFP/mylz2-mCherry* double-transgenic CG1-strain syngeneic zebrafish ([@R8]). NOD (non-obese diabetic)/SCID (severe combined immunodeficiency)/IL2g null mice used in this study were obtained from Jackson Laboratory.\n\nMicro-injection and ERMS Generation {#S12}\n-----------------------------------\n\nThe *rag2-kRASG12D*, *rag2-ICN1* (zebrafish intracellular notch1a), *rag2-GFP*, and *rag2-dsREDexpress* constructs were linearized with *Xho1*, phenol:chloroform extracted, ethanol precipitated, resuspended in 0.5 \u00d7 Tris-EDTA + 0.1 M KCl, and injected into one-cell-stage embryos of the respective backgrounds, as previously described ([@R13]).\n\nQuantification of Zebrafish Rhabdomyosarcoma Size and Initiation {#S13}\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nZebrafish were followed for tumor onset using an epifluorescent stereomicro-scope. Primary tumor size was quantified at 30 days of age using fluorescence intensity multiplied by the pixel area using the ImageJ software package as described previously ([@R5]). Kaplan-Meier tumor onset analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism software.\n\nFACS and ERMS Cell Transplantation {#S14}\n----------------------------------\n\nZebrafish ERMS tumor cells were fluorescently labeled with GFP, dsRED, or mCherry and stained with DAPI to exclude dead cells and were sorted twice using a Laser BD FACSAria II Cell Sorter. Sort purity and viability were assessed after two rounds of sorting when possible, exceeding 85% and 95%, respectively. Sorted ERMS cells were transplanted into syngeneic CG1 fish and monitored for tumor engraftment under a fluorescent dissecting microscope from 10 to 120 days post-transplantation. TPC frequency was quantified using the Extreme Limiting Dilution Analysis software (<http://bioinf.wehi>. edu.au/software/elda/).\n\nGene Expression Analysis {#S15}\n------------------------\n\nReal-time qPCR was completed using the Roche Lightcycler 480 machine. PCR primers and specific conditions are provided in [Table S5 and Supplemental Experimental Procedures](#SD1){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}. RNA isolation and cDNA preparation were performed as previously described ([@R5]).\n\nBioinformatic Analysis of Human Rhabdomyosarcoma Samples {#S16}\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nPreviously published transcriptome data from 65 ERMS samples ([@R24]) were processed using a standard Tuxedo pipeline ([@R27]). The resulting gene expression were log~2~ transformed and standardized (*Z* scored) using a set of 63 normal tissue samples. Using the \"Hmisc\" package in R, the Pearson correlation was determined for specific genes.\n\nHuman Rhabdomyosarcoma Cell Lines and PDX Tumor {#S17}\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nThe human RD cell line was obtained from the ATCC; SMS-CTR, 381T, Rh3, Rh5, and Rh30 cell lines were obtained from Dr. Corinne Linardic; the Rh18 (fusion-negative) cell line was obtained from Dr. Peter Houghton; and RMS176 and RMS559 ERMS cells were obtained from Dr. Jonathan Fletcher. The ERMS PDX tumor PCB00234 was obtained from Dr. Charles Keller under IRB protocol \\#2009-P-002756 and Partners Institutional Biosafety Committee (PIBC) \\#2012B000024.\n\nWestern Blot Analysis {#S18}\n---------------------\n\nTotal cell lysates from human rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines and human myoblasts were obtained following lysis in 2% SDS lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Western blot analysis used primary antibodies: rabbit a-NOTCH1 (Abcam), a-Cleaved NOTCH1 (Cell Signaling Technology), a-SNAI1 goat pAB (R&D Systems), a-Myosin Heavy Chain mouse mAb (monoclonal antibody) myosin heavy chain (a-MF20, R&D), MEF2C rabbit mAb (CST); and secondary antibodies: HRP (horseradish peroxidase) anti-rabbit (CST, 7074) or HRP anti-mouse (GE Healthcare, NA93IV). Membranes were developed using an ECL reagent (Western Lightning Plus ECL, PerkinElmer; or sensitive SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate, Thermo Scientific). Membranes were striped, rinsed, and re-probed with the respective internal control rabbit a-Lamin B1 (Abcam) or rabbit a-GAPDH (CST).\n\nChIP Assay {#S19}\n----------\n\nChromatin from 5 \u00d7 10^6^ RD cells was isolated and fixed with 1% formaldehyde, sonicated, and processed according to the manufacturer\\'s protocols (ChIP Assay Kit, Millipore). Immunoprecipitation was performed using 5 mg rabbit anti-NOTCH1 antibody (Abcam) or rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) and Pierce Protein A/G Agarose (Thermo Scientific). The immunoprecipitated DNA was subjected to real-time PCR with primers that target the SNAI1 promoter with negative controls in a region 7.5 kb upstream and an ORF (open reading frame)-free region in chromosome 6. All signals were normalized against input by the percentage input calculation method and normalized to IgG signal. Significance was calculated by Student\\'s t test.\n\nImmunofluorescence Staining {#S20}\n---------------------------\n\nCells were fixed at 72 hr post-transfection in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA)/PBS, permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100/PBS, and incubated with rabbit a-MEF2C (CST) and a-myosin heavy chain (R&D) in 2% goat serum/PBS. Secondary antibody detection used Alexa 488 goat anti-mouse and Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-rabbit (Invitrogen). Cells were counterstained with DAPI (1:10,000) and imaged. Images were processed in ImageJ and Adobe Photoshop.\n\nLentiviral, Retroviral, and siRNA Knockdown {#S21}\n-------------------------------------------\n\nScrambled control shRNA and gene-specific shRNAs were delivered on the pLKO.1-background vector and packaged using 293T cells. Retroviral particles were made in Plat-A packaging cells using FuGENE6 (Promega). rhabdomyosarcoma cells were infected with viral particles for 24 hr at 37\u00b0C with 4 \u03bcg/mL of polybrene (EMD Millipore). Gene-specific smart-pool or control small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) (Dharmacon, GE Life Sciences) (1 pmol) were reverse-transfected into cells using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX Transfection Reagent (Life Technologies) in flat, clear-bottom 96-well plates.\n\nMouse Xenografts, Bioluminescent Imaging, and Caliper Measurements {#S22}\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLuciferized RD cells were co-infected with shRNA lentivirus as outlined earlier. At 3 days post-infection, cells were collected, counted, and analyzed by flow cytometry to determine viability using DAPI. Equal numbers of viable cells were then embedded into Matrigel at a final concentration of 1 \u00d7 10^6^ cells per 100 \u03bcL and injected subcutaneously into anesthetized mice. Tumor growth was monitored weekly using bioluminescence imaging following injection using Luciferin at 75 mg/kg (15 mg/mL injected intraperitoneally). Comparison between groups was performed using a Student\\'s t test. When palpable, tumors were measured using a caliper scale to measure the greatest diameter and length, which were then used to calculate tumor volume.\n\nSupplementary Material {#S23}\n======================\n\nThis work was funded by NIH grants R01CA154923, R24OD016761, and U54CA168512 (to D.M.L.) and grants K99CA175184 (to M.S.I.); the Harvard Stem Cell Institute (to D.M.L.); Alex\\'s Lemonade Stand Foundation (to D.M.L. and M.S.I.); a St. Baldrick\\'s Research Grant (to D.M.L.); and a CPRIT grant RR160062 (to M.S.I.).
