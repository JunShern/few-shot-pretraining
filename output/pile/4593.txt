See Quick Start in\n  the Expo documentation for instructions on getting started using Expo\n  CLI.\n\nUnfortunately, react-native-cli is outdated. Starting 13 March 2017, use create-react-native-app instead. Moreover, you shouldn't install Yarn with NPM. Instead, use one of the methods on the yarn installation page.\n1. Install yarn\nVia NPM. According to its installation docs, you shouldn't install yarn via npm, but if necessary, you can still install it with a pre-v5 version of npm. \n\nUPDATE 2018  - OCTOBER\nNode 8.12.0 and NPM 6.4.1 is already compatible with create-react-native-app. Really some minors previous versions too. You don't need more downgrade your npm.\nOn Ubuntu.\ncurl -sS https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -\necho \"deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list\n\nOn macOS, use Homebrew or MacPorts.\nbrew install yarn\nsudo port install yarn\n2. Install the Create React Native App\nyarn global add create-react-native-app\n3. Update your shell environment\nsource ~/.bashrc\n4. Create a React native project\ncreate-react-native-app myreactproj\n\nA:\n\nYou got the order wrong. You should be\nyarn add global react-native-cli\nyarn add react-native\nreact-native init sample\n\n"
