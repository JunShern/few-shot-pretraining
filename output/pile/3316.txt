May Contain other Nuts.\n\nVegetarian\n\nCustomer reviews - Whole Earth Original Crunchy Peanut Butter 340g\n\nReviews\n\nPeanut Butter - Sat 28th Nov 2015\n\nThis has a delicious earthy crunch that is made for celery sticks. However after hearing about the ecological damage done by growing palm fruit I am disappointed to see palm oil used in this product. I will look for another alternative in future.\n\nReviewer's Name: Miss Ty\n\nAddictive! - Wed 29th Apr 2015\n\nVery very moreish! And very crunchy too. It passed our spreadability test with ease and good to know it's a healthy option.\n\nReviewer's Name: Karen\n\n- Mon 24th Mar 2014\n\nPeanut buttery goodness, can't really go wrong.\n\nReviewer's Name: C O'connell\n\nvery filling - Tue 28th Jan 2014\n\nI feel the crunchy texture adds a little something extra over the smooth version as it gives me something extra to munch on and enjoy more, but I suppose it depends on what it's used on or with.\n\nReviewer's Name: JM\n\n- Wed 13th Nov 2013\n\nMy husband is a big fan of peanut butter, he likes this one a lot, good sized jar and value for money.\n\nReviewer's Name: lorna wallace\n\n- Tue 15th Oct 2013\n\nTry spreading on rice cakes or ryvitas, then spreading strawberry jam on top and topping with sliced bananas, delicious.\n\nReviewer's Name: L E Champion\n\nOur favourite. - Tue 16th Jul 2013\n\nThis is delicious peanut butter. Whole Earth have it spot on. Not too grainy, it has a lovely nutty crunch, not too salty, spreads well, I can't fault it. I wonder if they could sell it in litre tubs as we go through so much of it. My son is a lover of the smooth peanut butter, and it is just as yummy. I wont consider buying other brands now, as none compare to this.\n\nReviewer's Name: Amye Armstrong\n\n- Sun 7th Jul 2013\n\nI've repurchased this item many times before, this peanut butter is great added to a peanut butter blondie mixture, mix with some agave syrup and put inside a split banana (skin still on) then placed under a grill or simply spread on ryvitas or rice cakes and topped with jam and sliced bananas. Delicious.\n\nReviewer's Name: L E Champion\n\nThe bestest peanut butter in the world - Wed 10th Oct 2012\n\nThe subject line says it all!\n\nReviewer's Name: Miss H C Schofield\n\n- Wed 20th Oct 2010\n\nBest peanut butter in the world!\n\nReviewer's Name: A L Williams\n\n- Sun 4th Mar 2007\n\nYou really have to try this item - the flavour is incredible and you will find yourself eating the whole lot before you know it - just dip your finger in and lick it off - scrumptious"
