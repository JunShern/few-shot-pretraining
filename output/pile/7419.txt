    "text": "Various types of structures that are generally referred to as towers are in use on recreational and pleasure boats. The towers are typically fabricated from metal tubing or pipe. The towers form a structure over part of the deck surface of the boat. The tower is typically fastened to some part of the deck of the boat and extends upward from the deck surface. The towers are also known to those of ordinary skill in the art variously as arches, half towers, tuna towers, towers, hardtops, and hardtop support systems. The towers can be used to provide sunshade, shelter from the elements, mounting points for a variety of equipment for various purposes, and additional control stations.\nThe present invention is directed to a device for permitting multi-directional movement of the tubing framework and for easily mounting, removing and replacing tubing on boats. In the prior methods and devices for attaching these structures to boat decks, the most common method is to utilize mating male and female fittings. Generally, in the prior methods, the female fitting is attached in some manner to the upper surface of the boat deck. The towers all have several legs that form the mounting points on the deck. In order to be able to place and withdraw the male component from the female component of the fitting, it is necessary for the female component of the fittings to all have the same directional orientation. One problem with creating the proper orientation is that the deck mounting surfaces on many boats is generally not flat but varies over its surface at some angle to the horizontal. Due to this variation in the deck surface, it is difficult to install the plurality of fittings with a uniform vertical orientation for the female fitting. Consequently, mounting and removing the towers can be difficult.\nThe prior art presents a variety of approaches that have been engaged to mount, remove and replace tubing on boats. Notwithstanding these efforts to provide suitable mounts and fittings, the existing prior art devices are limited in numerous respects. Accordingly, what is lacking that the prior art has not provided is a simple fitting that provides for multi-directional movement of the tubing framework."
