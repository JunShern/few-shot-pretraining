    "text": "Content Marketing is a Long Game\n\nI just got back from having coffee with a client. We were talking about content, its importance, and the fact that you simply can\u2019t game the system (by system I mean Google).\n\nWe were also lamenting the fact that honest and effective SEO companies are not always the ones that \u201cwin the bid.\u201d The client will not always want to hear what these SEO providers have to say. Instead what they want to hear is \u201cwe will get you 100s of leads overnight for next to nothing.\u201d\n\nSure, we all like to dream. We all like to get the best deal. But, remember, you get what you pay for. I\u2019m not just talking about money here. I\u2019m also talking about time. Because, time is money.\n\nEverything Google does is geared towards delivering the best search results to its users. Think about that. What is a good search result in your industry? What are your clients looking for?\n\nI\u2019ve gotten into debates in the past with less than stellar SEO companies about their efforts to game the system. For example, one company wanted to create a series of pages for every location the client served\u2026 each having the same content! I warned them that Google was warning against this. Their answer\u2026 \u201cwell, it works great right now.\u201d I think you can see where this is headed.\n\nContent marketing, \u201ca marketing technique of creating and distributing valuable, relevant and consistent content to attract and acquire a clearly defined audience \u2013 with the objective of driving profitable customer action,\u201d is another piece of this strategy.\n\nIt\u2019s a long game. What does this mean? It means that marketing with content (good utility content) will not convert right away. You can\u2019t expect to write a blog post, like this one, and get a sale from it tomorrow. You might, and it doesn\u2019t hurt to ask, but it isn\u2019t the point.\n\nThe point of content marketing is build trust in your brand. You\u2019re working to become THE resource in your industry. The go-to. To do this, you need to consistently provide value, answer questions, and solve problems\u2026 expecting nothing in return.\n\nThis might seem crazy to some. But, think about it this way. You could \u201csell, sell, sell\u201d right out of the gates and maybe get a few leads. But, how many people have you turned off in the process? And how many people will refer you to their contacts based on this approach? Not many. Why would they? You haven\u2019t given them anything. And that\u2019s the way it works today.\n\nJon-Mikel Bailey - Before co-founding Wood Street in 2002, Jon worked in sales, marketing and business development for technology and marketing firms. A popular speaker, he gives seminars on marketing, internet marketing, branding and web design to chambers of commerce, trade associations and colleges. He has a BFA in Photography from Frostburg State University and still shoots photos for Wood Street clients.\n\nFor almost 60 years our company has been manufacturing reliable construction equipment. The trust in the EDCO brand comes from decades of superior face-to-face customer service and training. To grow, we needed to expose more people to our high-quality service. Obviously, an upgraded Internet presence was the best way to reach new audiences. We had lots of online training ideas, but our outdated website prevented us from realizing them. We brought big ideas to Wood St who created an entirely new website based on... Read More"
