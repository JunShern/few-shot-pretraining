Can't say I've been too impressed with them, especially because they keep reusing the same characters in the same ways with slight twists in the plot that really don't add to the overall creativity of the episode. It's become predictable and mundane. I'd really love to see an episode that makes me laugh really hard at least once.\n\nHey big douche OP, I don't understand your english. Seriously, I know its the internet but at least make your posts somewhat coherent. What're you like twelve anyway? Were you even born when the show started? That's what your ramblings make me think. Honestly though you are lauding this show as high art? I'm sure Matt and Trey will probably tell you their first goal on this show is to make a show that people will laugh at. That the majority will laugh at, none the less.That is the goal of any comedy series. They started out with construction paper honestly c'mon. You are the person that they consistently make fun of in their episodes. You need to take step back and stop dwelling on the negative. Again you big giant douche.\n\nAlso I have to say: Character and plot development in the course of twenty two minutes is f*cking ridiculous to think possible in the day to day life of an episode. The episodes lately have had potential that they haven't reached but its time constraint related. So to do what they do in a week is actually pretty amazing you big douche.\n\nSomehow I think anyone who does comedy has to think their own work is hilarious because humor can be really subjective. You can get away with making formulaic crap in music that is produced specifically to be hit material, but I don't think it's possible for someone to write comedy for a mass audience that they themselves don't think is funny.\n\nSpeaking of selling out, has anyone here seen THIS at their local supermarket?\n\nWhen this caught my eye, I did a double-take and almost dropped my groceries and ran out of the store screaming.\n\ntommy2tone20 wrote:Dear Fellow Members and/or devoted fans, I have started this forum to recruit those of you who believe that south park sold out after the 10th season. This is a funeral. This is a debate. I want those who disagree with me to please join this madness. The world ends when the show is killed! Chef died! Issac Hayes converted to scientology! God Damn it! it was so wonderful at it's peek and has become way to direct with it's messages. It used to be subtle and now it's sickeningly uncreative. I am angry and want you to be angry with me! i am depressed and want you to be depressed with me! Why is kenny a drug addict? Why is Mr. Garrison a man again! What the f*ck happened to Cartman! They made him too blunt. They gave away the secret and threw away the magic and recipe. WHere is the piano music? WHere is the cynicism and since when did south park become the new family guy or even The Simpsons? When did this happen and how can we change it? How can i be offended by south park? I am a fan of the show being offensive! I love you guys! Trey Parker and Matt stone are brilliant but dissapoint me. I am dedicated to watching each episode! Does any other fan agree with me? Am i alone! PLease help me! What happened to towlie? Who's saying baby that don't mean a thing? Nowadays clancy can;t even sing! I guess this economy is effecting everyone, even our heroes, the animators and show writers!\n\nMaybe you should like... do something productive with your life calling Matt and Trey your heroes, eating sleeping and breathing South Park, hating every episode since season 10 yet still obsessively watching it as of season 13. \"Am I alone! Please help me!\" OH NO! My favorite TV show isn't as good to me anymoar! HELP! Yes, my friend, South Park is certainly serious bussiness.\n\nWelcome to the all new southpark.cc.com!\n\nWe've Updated Our Terms\n\nBy clicking outside of this box or X, you agree to the Site's updated Terms of Use and consent to the collection, use, disclosure and transfer of information as described in this Site's updated Privacy Policy and to third parties receiving information about the videos you watch as described in this Site\u2019s Video Privacy Terms.
