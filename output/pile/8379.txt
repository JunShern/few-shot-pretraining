Would be nice to have an alternative.\n\nA:\n\nHow about ProcessBuilder?\nA bit more:\nIntroduced in Java 1.5, allows you to gain more control on the process environment - set the working directory, let you redirect the error stream to the input stream (from java POV) and a few more things. \nFrom Oracle's site:\n\nProcessBuilder - The new ProcessBuilder class provides a more\n  convenient way to invoke subprocesses than does Runtime.exec. In\n  particular, ProcessBuilder makes it easy to start a subprocess with a\n  modified process environment (that is, one based on the parent's\n  process environment, but with a few changes).\n\n"
