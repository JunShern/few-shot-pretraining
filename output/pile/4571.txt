    "text": "\nThe ad tech renaissance - taylorbuley\nhttp://bokonads.com/the-ad-tech-renaissance/\n======\noxymoron\nI'll concede that the analysis isn't completely without merit, but having\nspent the last few years in ad tech, I sincerely hope that there won't be a\nrevival. It's a race to the bottom. Publishers are struggling and are\nincreasingly willing to accept ever more outrageous ad products. Advertisers\nare desperate for advertising that actually works, but will mostly only do\nwhat agencies tell them, and the agencies are only interested in maximizing\ntheir own margins. In the middle we've got any number of middle men scrambling\nfor some pieces of the cake, sometimes but usually not providing some value,\nleaving the publishers with a pathetic fraction of the advertiser spend.\n\nSo essentially we've got a whole bunch of companies with no growth desperately\nvying for the attention of 23-year old media buyers who in turn are mostly\ninterested in getting someone to take them clothes shopping and picking up the\nbill. These companies are doing it mostly by doing ever more intrusive things,\nsince advertisers can't accept that the reason their ads don't perform is that\nnobody wants their stuff and keeps looking for a silver bullet.\n\nI've come to believe that the only reasonable justification for most\nadvertising is that it's in some sense a way for other industries to subsidize\njournalism. Since that's going away, I'm looking forward to the inevitable ad\ntech carnage ahead, and if a potential next wave actually brings higher\nquality advertising and better end user experiences I'll happily eat my shoes.\n\n~~~\nvosper\nAll of this, plus the vast amounts of bot traffic that no one wants to look\ntoo closely at, because everyone except the advertiser is making money off of\nit...\n\n~~~\nec109685\nBot traffic is accounted for in the price advertisers pay for ads. Advertisers\ndon't run unprofitable ads.\n\n~~~\nsimo7\nAdvertisers do run unprofitable ads and marketing campaigns all the times.\n\nAnd they are fine with that too. That's the case of VC-backed startups: they\naccept a negative ROI to get the chance to start making money one day.\n\nThen you have the less consciuous ones, which might be big brands who want to\nexperiment a bit with new media/ad formats.\n\nIn any case, if you think about it, the real losers are...the honest\npublishers. Because the money on the table is not increased by fraud, it's\njust shared in a way that takes something away from good publishers to\nbad/fake ones.\n\n~~~\nec109685\nI agree honest publishers are at a definite disadvantage. Advertisers aren't\nbecause the roi calculation they come up with judges their campaigns based on\nits performance, which incorporates good and bad clicks over time.\n\n------\ndjur\nI don't see any mention of ad blockers. Are these seen as having a significant\neffect on the online advertising industry? Are there any serious proposals to\ndeal with them other than continuing the ad-blocker-blocker-blocker... arms\nrace?\n\nIt seems that there's an increasing understanding among publishers that low-\nquality and intrusive ads encourage their visitors to use ad blockers or\nanother site. Several relatively high-profile sites (like The New Yorker) have\nstopped using networks like Outbrain and Taboola. (Obnoxious ads from the\nlatter, along with autoplaying video ads on numerous sites, resulted in me\nfinally installing an ad blocker after resisting for years.)\n\nAdblock Plus offered a way forward with its \"Acceptable Ads\" program but it\nseems like that has been roundly rejected by both advertisers and blocker\nusers. Maybe publishers and advertisers could work together to develop a\nstricter set of advertising guidelines that show respect for users? I suppose\nsuch a program is essentially doomed without cooperation from Google and\nFacebook, and I don't know if they'd be willing to work with the little fish\n(or each other).\n\nIt seems like an intractable problem. I'm not convinced technology (machine\nlearning! the solution to all problems!) is capable of providing the solution.\n\n~~~\ntomjen3\nThe problem is that most ads suck. Facebook knows more about me than I do, but\nthey can't come up with ads for things I want. What possible chance does a\nrandom newspaper have?\n\n~~~\npascalxus\nI completely agree. 99.99% of the ads I see on facebook are for things I don't\nwant. They really need to get more AI and more information about the user for\nbetter targeting. They may have world class targeting, but it still sucks\ncompared to advertisement that can read my mind (doesn't exist yet).\n\n~~~\npdkl95\nA common misconception is that targeting is about _your_ interests. An AI\nwon't select ads for things you want. Instead, it will use all of that\ntracking data to select ads that are more effective at misleading you or\n_changing_ your interests.\n\n~~~\ntomjen3\nWhat is easiest? Sell me things that I already want but don't know about, or\nchanging my interests and then convince me to buy a particular product?\n\nIncidentally 5 years after moving into an apartment I still need a good\ncurtain for the kitchen. If I see an ad for a place I can upload measurements\nand get the results sent to me I would be very happy to pay.\n\n------\nniftich\n_> The end of impressions and banners in favor of views and \"publisher\nrendered\" (aka native) creative_\n\nNative advertising, which I'd re-phrase as 'sponsored content' or 'content\nplacement', I can actually enjoy, if the sponsorship is made clear and the\ntopic is genuinely relevant to the audience. After all, who better to tell\nwhat kinds of content readers want to see besides the publisher who puts it\nout there? But it _has_ to fit -- out-of-place content will be painfully\nobvious, and cause further user aversion for ads.\n\nBut the thing is: all of this can be accomplished without ad networks that\ntrack your travels through the web. The client can engage the publisher\ndirectly or through a broker. Where does that leave today's adtech?\n\n~~~\nandygates\nThat seems unduly optimistic. The content will be uploaded from the same old\nterrible content farms, and be the same old rubbish only with a heavier local\nserver load.\n\n------\nsoared\nVery interesting read, thanks OP! I've started using some platforms with\nintegrated ml, and it seems to be much better. Its difficult to get used to\nstarting a campaign, and instead of meticulously setting up targeting (males,\n$50k income, denver, into football and skiing, etc) the ml lets you just ..\nupload an ad and a web page. No targeting. Click GO and it will find your\ncustomers. If Google or facebook can get into this space they'll succeed\ngreatly because they have so much data and users already trust them.\n\n~~~\nmars4rp\ncan you please name those platforms ???\n\n~~~\nsoared\nI'm at an agency and have access to some closed betas, but I've been pretty\nimpressed with StackAdapt for their native. They just added video and display\nI believe but I haven't used them. You do a little bit of manual targeting but\ntheir ml really does well.\n\n~~~\nfumar\nWhen you say \"does well,\" what type of goal or kpi are referring to?\n\n~~~\nsoared\nWhite paper downloads for elderly people. For some reason their interface\nunderreports conversions though. But we've tied their traffic directly to\npurchases! One note though.. like some other channels you're buying a mixed\nbag. There is a lot of low quality traffic, but the diamonds in the rough do\nmake up for it.\n\n------\nkeldaris\nSince there's rarely any widely interpretable public data available, articles\nlike this and many others are my best gauge for noting that even the Internet\nadvertising industry itself recognizes that it's dying. This is very pleasant\nto observe.\n\nPersonally, I can't remember the last ad I've seen while browsing. The\ncombination of AdBlock Origin (with a very generous combination of various\nblocklists), Ghostery / Privacy Badger and NoScript effectively renders most\nadtech useless. The few remnants that refuse to be blocked I happily skip\noutright rather than enable. As far as I'm concerned, the only acceptable form\nof advertising consists of things like hardware companies supplying free\nsamples to review sites without any preconditions and even there a slippery\nslope exists, as evidenced by the sad state of the games \"journalism\"\nindustry, where corruption is endemic.\n\nAnd the best part is that, unlike many political and social issues, users\nreally do have all the power here, and it's trivially easy to exercise it.\nInstall a few trusted browser extensions and you've helped hasten the demise\nof a harmful parasite of an industry, and improved your own security at the\nsame time. And nowadays it's easy to persuade even non-technical users to do\nthis due to how disgusting and intrusive ads have become.\n\n~~~\nkirso\nCongratulations! You are in the 10% of people who have adblock :) Within the\n600B advertising industry. You get the point right? Normal people think\ndifferent. In addition, mobile is overtaking everything and adblocking there\nis more tricky, thats why Facebook is generating 80%+ of their revenues via\nmobile ads (fun fact, in 2010 it was 0%). You can ask your parents for\ninstance whether they know how to limit ad tracking.\n\n------\nlcw\nI _feel_ like another piece missing from why these companies are \"flat\" year\nover year is the fact that they are running into a wall of what people will\ntolerate. I don't think that there will be a renaissance like the author\nconcludes. As a guy who worked in ad tech these tricks have been exhaustively\ntried. I think right now the industry trend is to pay for premium content\nrather then be inundated with Ads especially when it comes to games, video and\nmusic. I imagine we will see this pattern continue especially with the mobile\ngaming industry figuring out the key to everyone's wallet: in app purchases.\n\n------\nmanigandham\nThis article is mostly bullshit.\n\nAppNexus is one of the major SSPs (sell-side platforms) but they still have\nmajor fraud and legacy tech issues. They are also one of the primary causes of\nmiserable user experiences across the web. They will not be part of any adtech\nrenaissance.\n\nGoogle won't flinch if margins really do go down to single-digit margins.\nThey're already built for worse conditions than today and are just pacing the\nmarket, as seen with the whole header bidding scenario. They also have Google\nCloud rapidly scaling and will likely be a bigger source of revenue than their\nentire ads division in a few years.\n\nMeanwhile AppNexus can barely survive on their current margins and will be out\nof business if it hits single-digits. The disintermediation mentioned in this\narticle will also apply just as harshly to AppNexus.\n\nThe lame insights about machine learning and formats aren't anything special.\nThis is why Google and Facebook get all the money already, because they have a\nmuch faster, cleaner, more relevant, and more effective ad experiences. The\nrenaissance is already here and it's getting increasingly harder to compete\nwith these data behemoths. It's not impossible though and there are several\nniche focused ad startups, but there's no big sea change about to happen. This\nis all just business as usual.\n\n------\nawongh\nThis is a space I wish I knew more about- but it seems like it has it's own\nsub-culture that to me, is hard to parse.\n\nCan someone tell me what some of the things are that he refers to in this\narticle?\n\n\\- dfp, dsp, ssp, gdn, dbm, adx, dcm, dfp\n\nIs there a good technical-minded rundown of all the players in the ecosystem\nand what they do? Internet ad industry information is impossible to google\nbecause it mostly turns up spam.....\n\n~~~\nwastedhours\nI've tried to find a long form piece on it (ideally a physical book as\nreference), but failed.\n\nDSP: Demand Side Platform, is the tool agencies and advertisers use to buy the\nad spots automatically based on tracking profiles.\n\nSSP: Supply Side Platform, is the tool publishers use to sell their ad spots\n(publishers push an impression to an SSP, a DSP will evaluate it and an agency\nwill buy an ad on it - Google is main SSP and DSP [I think?] so people are\nwary about them.)\n\nDFP: DoubleClick for Publishers perhaps, as in, ad tech for media sites to\nmanage the display process (guess it could be called Google's SSP).\n\nDBM: DoubleClick Bid Manager, is Google's DSP\n\nADX: guessing just an ad exchange, so a place advertisers and publishers do\nthe deal.\n\nGDN: Google Display Network, posh AdSense where you can place your ads across\n3rd party sites, not just the SERP.\n\nThen we get into the world of Header Bidding (which, as far as I understand\nit, is even more tech to bypass your usual SSP/DSP process to get the best\ndeal from different ad exchanges) and that whole murky world...\n\nI've only been on the advertiser end, speccing a programmatic campaign through\na specialist agency. It makes me nervy as our only marketing attribution is\nlast touch and that rarely works with broad reach display. Retargeting is a\nmuch more valuable one to explore.\n\nIf anyone would be interested in a guide, I can look to put one together with\ndefinitions and a few anecdotes from some players? Username @ gmail.\n\n~~~\nssharp\nI think it's worth adding how DSPs and ADXs fit together. There are only a\nhandful of ad exchanges out there -- Google ADX, OpenX, AppNexus, etc. Some\nbrands and agencies are large enough to buy inventory directly through these\nbut for most brands and agencies, it's too expensive and cumbersome to do so.\nThis is where DSPs fit in. DSPs buy large batches of inventory from the ad\nexchanges and resell them to brands and agencies and try to add value where\nthey can.\n\n------\nintrasight\nI've come to believe that this isn't a technology problem. It's a people\nproblem - specifically a \"publisher people are lazy\" problem. That lazyness\nmade them hand their value over to Google and Facebook, and now there's just\nno easy way to get it back.\n\n------\ncm2012\n85% of new ad dollars are going to fb and google. Everyone else is fighting\nfor scraps.\n\n~~~\nkirso\nNot actually true, these scraps are still worth billions => google AppLovin\n\n------\npetercooper\nI know it's not for everyone but I hope more publishers can work out a shift\nto a no-graphics-needed-to-render-this \"advertisers<->publishers\" approach.\n\nAre your readers the sort of people advertisers want to connect with? Great!\nSell space and support to them. Or is your audience so diverse and ephemeral\nthat advertisers don't care? Move into publishing stuff that's useful to an\naudience advertisers value, because when everyone else is slipping down the\nladder, it's a great time to try climbing it.\n\n------\nna85\n>The internet needs an ad tech renaissance, one based on creating real value\nfor publishers and marketers,\n\nCould not disagree more.\n\nAdvertising as a whole needs to die in ignominy. Obviously that'll never\nhappen, but we should be working towards ways to make advertising obsolete or\nunprofitable, and we should be ostracizing people like the author who try to\nor want to make things better for advertisers.\n\nThe promise of the internet was users as first-class citizens, not users as\nmindless consumers of hostile advertising.\n\n~~~\nSerLava\nHostile advertising and advertising in general aren't the same thing.\n\nI'd be the first to point out that advertising has motivated a wide array of\nterrible things, especially in the last few years. But advertising at its\nbarest sense can be and usually is a net positive force.\n\n~~~\nna85\n>Hostile advertising and advertising in general aren't the same thing.\n\nAre you sure?\n\n~~~\nSerLava\nGood point.\n\n------\nmonochromatic\nWe don't need an ad tech renaissance. We need to burn it to the fucking\nground.\n\n~~~\nHugoDaniel\n^ this.\n\n------\nmajewsky\n> The tracking tech renaissance\n\nFTFY\n\n------\nTheAdamist\nI don't know if it was due to manual ad reviewers being on holiday or what,\nbut i was getting a bunch of ad hijacking or malvertisements over the weekend\nfrom legit websites. If even legit sites can't keep up with this then no\nwonder everyone is running ad blockers just to keep safe from legit sites.\n\n------\ndedalus\nreally nice article detailing some nuances\n\n~~~\ndedalus\nreally surprised by the downvote without any reason. so much for tolerance of\nopposite views. The author is an authority in adtech (CEO of App Nexus). I\nexpressed an opinion of the piece (which you are free to disagree with and\nmaybe the disagreement is downvoting??)\n\n------\nfieryeagle\nVery good read that highlighted the current state of the industry - G and FB\nreign as kings. I'd expect the fraud cycle to restart in gaming industry\nseeing that display and mobile are essentially saturated.\n\n"
