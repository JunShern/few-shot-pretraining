Perhaps the most powerful of those time-tested tools is the custom magazine.\n\nSuffering from a lack of motivation? Look outside\u2014it may be the weather.\n\nIf you feel less motivated than usual on those days, you\u2019re not alone. Scientists haven\u2019t been able to identify exactly why our motivation disappears when the sun does, but they have some ideas. There\u2019s even a mood disorder called Seasonal Affective Disorder, or SAD, that affects people who live in places that are consistently dark and dreary.\n\nSo what do you do on those mornings when you feel like you can\u2019t get anything done? Instead of sending yourself into a caffeine coma, try some of these methods to get your motivation back.\n\n\u201cPrint is dead.\u201d If you\u2019ve heard it once, you\u2019ve heard it a thousand times.\n\nThese days it\u2019s impossible to go very long without reading or hearing about how smartphones and tablets are replacing printed materials. But while it\u2019s 100% true in many respects, there\u2019s one medium where print still reigns: magazines.\n\nThere\u2019s a common belief that only older people read magazines. Even if you\u2019ve read about how custom magazines drive online sales and web traffic, you may be hesitant to spend time planning and launching a custom publication for your organization for fear of a slow and steady decline as the Baby Boomers get older.\n\n\u201cHow often should I blog?\u201d Type those words into Google and you\u2019ll find more than half a billion-with-a-b results trying to answer that question. Everyone is looking for an answer to the same question, but with so many experts offering so much conflicting advice, it can be almost impossible to make sense of it all.\n\nComing up with a blogging plan can be an even bigger challenge for a hospital marketer. There are few hospital blogs to use as examples as you hone your own organization\u2019s blogging strategy, and what works for a Fortune 500 company or for a small business might not be best for your audience.\n\nAccording to Hoffman \u201ctours\u201d last approximately four years (but with a review after two years). That\u2019s how long a company can expect to sign up an employee to one job. After four years both sides should sit down and decide if another tour works for both parties. If not, you\u2019re a \u201cfree agent\u201d!\n\nIf I had to bet on one thing you have not done, this would be it: I\u2019d bet you have not developed personas of your patients.\n\nI\u2019d bet on this because I\u2019ve developed a persona of you. My persona of you says you have very little time. And with very little time available this is a step in marketing it\u2019s very tempting to skip. (I\u2019ve skipped this step many times myself and I\u2019m in marketing too.)"
