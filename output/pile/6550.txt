    "text": "Developers of the game Tony Hawk Underground 2, and the upcoming games Fantastic Four and Myst 5: End of Ages will now answer to a new parent company. Beenox Studios, which is located in Quebec, Canada, announced that Activision acquired them as a wholly owned subsidiary. Working with Activision since 2003, it is obvious that Activision liked what they saw coming from Beenox. Under the terms of the agreement, several management and key employees from Beenox Studios have signed long-term contracts with Activision. Also noted is that the 32 person team of developers will remain based in Quebec. This is undoubtedly good news to them and won't interrupt release schedules. Speaking of which, Myst 5: End of Ages is scheduled for release Fall of 2005 and Fantastic Four is scheduled to hit store shelves next month.\n\nUSER COMMENTS 4 comment(s)\n\nTypical(4:03pm EST Thu May 26 2005)First, Myst was cool when it first came out but I find the recent versions lame. I guess some people like though or it would not be continued.\n\nAnyway regarding Fantastic Four, this game, which may or may not be cool, is being released for PS2 and XBox and Game Cube. Where possible, I expect this type of release to continue into the future (for at least the PS3 & XBOX 360 once developers figure out how to program and port games between consoles). So, all the fanboy BS will likely be meaningless.\n\nBut if you want to pick one of the next generation consoles, start with XBOX 360 (which will be out first, will likely be easier to program and may actually have more useful power for game processing even though the PS3 will have more pure processing power) and then pick up the PS3 in about 2 years when the price drops, the developers figure out how to program for it effectively and there actually is some media out there on blue ray disk.\n\nOr your could just pick the console based on the fact that you are a fanboy or stupid (but I repeat myself).\n\nAnyway, I am not sure why anyone would buy a game for a current version console now with the next gen consoles out so soon. Rent it and play it if you must but it seems reasonable to wait to upgrade any game you have (after all, most new games are similar to an existing game) until the next gens are here. \u2013 by IP Student\n\nRE: Why buy current games\u2026(6:41pm EST Thu May 26 2005)Um. Because they will still work on the new consoles? Because they want to wait for prices to drop before splurging for a new, unneeded console? There are many reasons to continue buying games for current consoles.\n\nAnd most people buy consoles because they like the games for it, not because of its potential or because of they are \u201cfanboys\u201d. But I guess in your world\u2026 \u2013 by QM\n\nwhatever(7:04pm EST Thu May 26 2005)people buy games because they are good , not for next gen console\u2026to hell with Sony or mrofsoft ,my current system is good enough and the last time I check ps3 & evolution is backward compatible \u2013 by llinks\n\nwow(8:39am EST Fri May 27 2005)in the immortal words of dennis miller: \u201cif the phrase woop-de-fvckin-doo didn't already exist, i would invent it right now\u201d \u2013 by JunkTheMagicDragon"
