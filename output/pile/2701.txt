I couldn't figure that out why this is happening.\nDoes anyone know anything about this?\n\nA:\n\nCan you check what is the error reported in the crash log? Just look for main thread crash and search in the google - this might give some clue.\nNot sure if it's related to this:\nhttps://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=465693\nWhen crash happens, you'll see a rectangular dialog with a title of JVM Terminate on your screen and Studio will disappear. This indicates Java itself has crashed, but it creates a log file in the process.\nBy default, the crash file should be in either the Studio installation directory, or in the system temp directory, most likely with a file name of hs_err_pid*.log. If you still could not locate it, follow the directions here:\nFinding your Error Log\nOn OS X, the location is ~/Library/Logs/Java/*.crash.log or ~/Library/Logs/CrashReporter, and the file will have the word java in its name.\nhttp://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/guide/Crashes_and_Freezes\n\n"
