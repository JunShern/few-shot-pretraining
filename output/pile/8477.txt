These disturbing findings cannot be swept under the carpet.\n\n\u201cThe fact that more than 80 people are dying each week shortly after being declared fit for work should concern us all. We need a welfare system that supports people to find decent jobs not one that causes stress and ill health.\u201d\n\nFind out what you can do if you're wrongly declared 'fit to work' here.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nThe Mirror first used Freedom of Information laws in 2012 to expose how every week 32 people were dying after being put into the work-related activity group following \u201cwork capability assessments\u201d.\n\nThe DWP insisted that the death rate for people on benefits had fallen over 10 years to 2013 \u201cin line with the general working age population\u201d.\n\nBut the death rate of those in the \u201cwork related activity group\u201d, who now get the same rate as the jobseekers allowance, rose in 2013 to 532 per 100,000 \u2013 more than double the general working age population.\n\nBack to work deaths 2,380 People died in just over two years after being declared fit to work by Government officials\n\nRob Holland, of Mencap, said: \u201cThese tragic figures warrant further investigation. We know the fit for work test is failing disabled people, with devastating consequences.\u201d\n\nA DWP spokesman said: \u201cThe Government continues to support millions of people on benefits with an \u00a380billion working age welfare safety net in place.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, Work Secretary Iain Duncan Smith announced that he planned changes to the work capability assessments."
