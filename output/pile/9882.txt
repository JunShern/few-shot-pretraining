Doh, I know this. The balloon notification appears in the bottom right of the screen:\n\nHow can I disable this annoying warning (which interrupts and delays the startup process btw)?\nNote that this is a \"balloon warning\" from the righthand side of the taskbar (where utilities/hardware are located). The activating software is the \"Intel PROSet Wireless WiFi Software\".\nHere is the \"Customize\" options from Windows with the Wireless item among them. Note that there is no \"Show Icon and Hide Notifications\" choice:\n\nA:\n\nI figured out how to solve the problem. The key is to single click on the notification balloon. You have to do this fast, because it disappears after a few seconds. When you do this the following \"troubleshooter\" pops up:\n\nNotice how there is a blue \"Disable notifications\" label in the lower left. This is actually a toggle believe it or not. Click it once to disable notifications.\n\n"
