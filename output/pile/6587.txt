    "text": "U.S. technology employment boom is looking unstoppable\n\nAccording to Cyberstates 2018, the annual IT Industry outlook report published by CompTIA, last year the number of tech jobs in the United States grew by 200,000, to approximately 11.5 million. The tech industry contributed $1.6 trillion to the economy \u2014 the largest individual sector in America. There doesn't seem to be any stopping this technology employment boom.\n\nRole of IT in economy\n\nThe technology employment boom is playing a prominent role in state economies as well. In 22 U.S. states, the IT sector was among the top five economic players and it was among the top 10 in 42 states.\n\nTodd Thibodeaux, president and CEO of CompTIA, clarified that the local, regional, and federal economies\u2019 direct gains due to the technology sector was just one part of the complete picture.\n\nHe went on to explain that technology was leading the way for progress, innovation, and development in almost every industry including:\n\nHighly specialized manufacturing\n\nTransportation\n\nBuilding smart communities\n\nEducation\n\nPower and energy\n\nMedicine\n\nJob trends in IT\n\nThey predict that the current trend \u2014 an annual increase in 200,000 tech jobs since 2010 \u2014 will prevail in 2018 as well and even more so in 2019. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics expects the core technology jobs to reach 626,000, in 2026. If you consider the number of jobs created due to retirements and career-shifts, then this number could be as high as 1.2 million, in 2026.\n\nThe demand and supply mismatch also continues nationwide, with experts confirming that more jobs than qualified applicants were currently available.\n\nThe number of jobs in new age technologies grew by 27 percent every year, throughout the U.S. This further substantiated the trend that showed increased investments in sectors such as:\n\nInternet of Things\n\nArtificial intelligence\n\nMachine learning\n\nSelf-driving vehicles\n\nAugmented reality\n\nVirtual reality\n\nThese technology jobs also offered better pay than those in other sectors. The Cyberstates 2018 report revealed that the average annual pay in the IT sector was $112,890, a mindboggling 107 percent above $54,420, the national average for all other sectors.\n\nOther findings of Cyberstates 2018\n\nOther key findings of the research were as follows:\n\nIn 2016, the tech sector grew in 36 states. This pattern continued and in 2017, 38 states showed an increase in the number of tech jobs. The five states contributing the maximum number of new jobs were:\n\nCalifornia (43,600)\n\nTexas (13,400)\n\nMichigan (13,200)\n\nFlorida (12,000)\n\nNew York (10,400)\n\nIn terms of percentage growth, the top states that created the most new IT jobs in 2017 were:\n\nUtah (+ 3.6 percent)\n\nMichigan (+ 3.4 percent)\n\nNorth Carolina (+3.1 percent)\n\nWashington (+ 2.9 percent)\n\nIdaho (+ 2.8 percent)\n\nThe top five states with regard to the size of the technology workforce in proportion to other sectors were:\n\nMassachusetts (10.6 percent)\n\nWashington (9.9 percent)\n\nVirginia (9.9 percent)\n\nThe District of Columbia (9.7 percent)\n\nColorado (9.7 percent)\n\nThe gender split in the sector remained unchanged from 2016 with men forming 66 percent and women 34 percent of the total workforce. At 39.8 percent, the District of Columbia had the maximum number of women workers in the sector. South Dakota, North Carolina, Wisconsin, and Missouri were the other states in the top five, in this statistic.\n\nFor the sixth straight year, the number of technology businesses grew. The number at last count was 503,000.\n\nNew businesses drive the technology employment boom\n\nAt present, 6.7 million people work in the technology industry. Where is this technology employment boom coming from? In the last quarter century, new businesses (operating for less than five years) created almost all new jobs added to the private sector.\n\nIn stark contrast, according to Jason Wiens and Chris Jackson at the Kauffman Foundation, from 2008 to 2011, older tech companies did away with more jobs than they added. This trend was evident for all except eight years during this period (you should also be aware that new sectors create more jobs than traditional ones).\n\nJob growth due to automation\n\nIf we were to learn from history, increased automation should result in job creation in all fields in the economy. The Atlantic\u2019s James Bessen pointed out that e-discovery software applications had replaced the demand for a huge chunk of paralegal tasks.\n\nDespite this, the number of jobs for both lawyers and paralegals grew well above the national average. Bessen explained that since 1980, jobs that required an above average use of technology, grew much faster \u2014 0.9 percent per year \u2014 than other more computer independent jobs.\n\nThis logic-defying trend was evident because automation brought down the cost of the service, leading to a surge in demand. This increased demand led to more job creation as opposed to job losses, as was anticipated when the technology first emerged.\n\nWith an increase in demand for a product or service, there is often an increase in new jobs as well. The jobs, which emerge post-automation, are at a higher skill level than those that technology replaced. Most often, these jobs were filled with local workforce because:\n\nCompanies could now afford to pay as per national norms (due to increased business).\n\nSince the older, less skilled monotonous work was automated, the jobs carried out by outsourced employees ceased to exist.\n\nAutomation and outsourcing\n\nThe latest elections brought to the fore the impact of outsourcing on the customer service sector \u2014 which outsourced the maximum number of jobs in the past. Both outsourcing and automaton have in the past negatively affected this industry.\n\nEconomic advantages led to the export of several jobs in the sector to countries such as India and the Philippines, where the operations were more cost-effective. The size of the global contact center business is pegged at $300 billion-$350 billion. Approximately a quarter of this (20 percent-25 percent) is outsourced.\n\nDuring the call-center boom, quality of customer service plunged because the customers had to interact with foreigners with inadequate training and poor language skills. All of that is changing due to technology.\n\nCustomers now prefer to use chats or email as opposed to telephone interactions. This is driving quality of interaction up while keeping cost of operations low because of less dependence on phone-contact centers.\n\nThe advent of smartphones, apps, and interconnected devices has made data collection more efficient.\n\nEmerging technologies used in these platforms track the user\u2019s every move, and discern the right facts from this data, making every customer interaction extremely effective and pocket-friendly. Therefore, the tasks that once required 500 foreigners can now be accomplished by 40 U.S. residents.\n\nGrowing automation is extending the tech boom\n\nThe growing automation due to Big Data, mobile app innovation, cloud computing, blockchain, and machine learning that we are seeing in the U.S. today is a continuing economic opportunity for the country and is a main catalyst for the technology employment boom.\n\nAutomation is expanding the scope of American jobs across the technology sector. When it comes to advanced quality work in the tech sector, the U.S. has an edge over most other markets. It appears evident that the technology employment boom is likely to continue at least in the near term.\n\nRead Next\n\nBenjamin Roussey\n\nBenjamin Roussey is from Sacramento, CA.

However, some months back I came across a startlingly troublesome statistic - this article purported that 25% of our current workforce was still computer illiterate. So, this part of the working population will not be able to reap the rewards and benefits of working in a technology field. How do we fix gap for future generations of workers? It's a given that almost all industries will be affected by technology and knowledge workers will be ascendent for decades to come.\n\nThat is an excellent point to make A.J. It is a vast problem with this country. It is not being emphasized enough. America is not producing enough tech pros. The problem is political correctness, teachers' unions, and public schools. Until we tackle those issues, which we may never be able to do, this problem and other educational problems will persist.\n\nWe need math, tech, and engineering grads, not humanities and philosophy graduates.\n\nLatest Podcast\n\nRecommended\n\nFollow Us\n\nU.S. technology employment boom is looking unstoppable\n\nTECHGENIX\n\nTechGenix reaches millions of IT Professionals every month, and has set the standard for providing free technical content through its growing family of websites, empowering them with the answers and tools that are needed to set up, configure, maintain and enhance their networks."
