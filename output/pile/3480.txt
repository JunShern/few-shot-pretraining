In your case you could simply use a \"trigger\" to indicate at least one finding and do the if after the loop:\nfound = False\nfor n in range(len(lista)):\n     if str(search) in lista[n]:\n         print(lista[n])\n         found = True\nif not found:\n     print(\"search not found in list\")\n\nHowever better would be to iterate over the list directly instead of a range of the length:\nfound = False\nfor item in lista:\n     if str(search) in item:\n         print(item)\n         found = True\nif not found:\n     print(\"search not found in list\")\n\nIf you don't like the trigger you can also use a conditional comprehension to get all the matches and use the number of matches as indirect trigger:\nfindings = [item for item in lista if str(search) in item]\nif findings:  # you got matches:\n    for match in findings:\n        print(match)\nelse:         # no matches\n     print(\"search not found in list\")\n\n"
