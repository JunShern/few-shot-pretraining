    "text": "The present invention relates generally to washers used in the assembly of mechanical structures, and particularly to two-piece washers that can be inserted in a mechanical structure after assembly.\nDuring and after the process of putting together a mechanical structure it is often discovered that a washer has either been inadvertently left out of the assembly or that a washer should be assembled in order to more precisely adjust the final assembly. This need may arise because of excess play along the shaft or to improve relative rotational movement between component parts. Usually, and under the best of circumstances, the only solution is to disassemble at least part of the structure to allow the washer to be slipped onto the shaft in the proper order of assembly, and then reassemble the remainder of the component parts. Under other circumstances, perhaps where the structure has been welded together, the only solution is to destroy some parts and start the assembly process from the beginning. These are time-consuming processes that cost money and efficiency in a commercial setting, and frustration for the mechanic in all situations.\nSolutions to this problem have been proposed, but none have met reasonable commercial acceptance. For instance, U-shaped spacers have been utilized in this application, but these must have some means of being securely locked into place or they can work themselves free of, or out of, the area in which they are meant to remain. Such hardware is relatively expensive to manufacture and less reliable in use than is required in a commercial assembly operation.\nAnother solution is proposed in U.S. Pat. No. 1,777,614. Generally, the washers described are designed to eliminate axial shifting relative to the shaft while, as will be discussed further below, the washer of the instant invention requires such shifting to move into and out of the interlocking position. In FIG. 5 a two-piece washer, including male and female parts is depicted. The male member has outer ends formed into ratchet teeth and the female member has ends terminating in spring jaws and ratchet teeth that engage with those on the male member. The two pieces are not identical and must be flexed or sprung apart in order to engage each other. Non-identical parts result in a more costly manufacturing requirement, call for greater logistics and packaging, and more difficulty in assembly because of the need to handle two parts. Additionally, the need to flex one or both pieces in order to interlock them is not always possible because of other close-fitting parts or components.\nYet another proposed solution is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 1,558,364. There is shown a two-piece structure using identical parts, each with a male end and a female end. However, the female end is bent open for assembly and must be physically bent into a locking position around the male end. The need to bend components makes this possible solution more impractical because, as pointed out above, often there is inadequate space available to insert pliers or other tools to accomplish this end.\nIt would be desirable and beneficial to provide a washer that would overcome the above-noted disadvantages of known washers.\nIt is an object of the instant invention to provide an improved washer that can be easily inserted onto an assembled shaft without the need to disassemble other component parts already fitted to the shaft.\nIt is another object of the instant invention to provide an improved washer that is more cost-effective, durable, cheap to produce, easier to use, and reliable than those known in the prior art.\nIt is yet another object of the instant invention to provide an improved washer that can be inserted at substantially any location along the length of a shaft with other component parts thereon without the need to disassemble the structure.\nIt is a still further object of the instant invention to provide an improved two-piece washer that includes a tab, or tabs, extending outwardly there from adjacent the interlocking elements to aide in the placement or removal of the washer, thus eliminating the need for special tools and the likelihood that parts will be dropped or mishandled during use.\nThese and other objects are obtained by providing a two-piece washer that can be inserted in a fully or partially assembled shaft structure without the necessity of removing component parts. The two identical substantially inflexible pieces each have, on the circumferential ends thereof, a tab and recess that interlock with the corresponding tab and recess on the respective ends of the mating piece. To insert the washer, the mating surfaces of the component parts at the insertion location on the shaft must be separated a distance at least twice the thickness of the washer so that the two pieces of the washer can be placed around the shaft and moved axially along the shaft and relative to each other into the interlocking position.\nThe foregoing and other objects, features and advantages of the invention will appear more fully hereinafter from a consideration of the detailed description which follows, in conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein one primary embodiment of the invention is illustrated by way of example. It is to be expressly understood, however, that the drawings are for illustrative purposes and are not to be construed as defining the limits of the invention."
