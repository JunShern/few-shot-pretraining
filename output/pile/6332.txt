PII may also be referred to as personally identifiable data or individually identifiable information. NOTE: Although PII alone is not health information, it must be protected the same as PHI. Whenever PHI is referenced in this presentation, the same standard applies to PII!\n\n8\nTP O \uf0a8 PHI is to be accessed for work-related purposes only \u2013 those that relate to T reatment, P ayment or health care O perations (TPO \u2013 defined later in this presentation) \uf0a8 Your access to PHI must be restricted to only the information necessary for you to perform your job o This

Privacy Rule. * Consult the Privacy Officer to ensure data has been sufficiently de-identified when in doubt\n\n11\n\uf0a8 Know \u201chow\u201d and \u201cwhere\u201d you should store PHI o Paper files should be stored in a filing cabinet or secure location when not in use (or at a minimum, turned facedown) o PHI stored in electronic databases, document logs, spreadsheet applications, etc. must be password protected and saved to a secure location, such as a department folder.\n\n12\n\uf0a8 Store important documents in a secure location (such as your user area or in a department folder) \uf0a8 Lock your screen before leaving the room (never leave your computer unlocked when unattended)\n\n13\n\uf0a8 All s must include confidentiality notice (see next slide for example) \uf0a8 When sending

required to disclose a member\u2019s PHI to the member\u2019s family or friends in emergency situations where the member becomes incapacitated or unable to agree or object \uf0a8 Generally, management should approve emergency disclosures, but use your best judgment \u2013 if there is not time for approval, document the situation thoroughly and notify your supervisor afterwards\n\n19\nMember
