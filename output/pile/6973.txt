    "text": "GADTs are obviously currently a hot topic in functional programming research. Most of the papers focus only on the GADT mechanism (how type checking works etc.). The only example that one usually sees is the \"typed evaluator\".\n\nI am not an expert on this topic, and I'd like to know more about how they would actually be useful in practical programming.\n\nFor example, I wonder how a parser would look like if it is impossible to construct \"wrong\" ASTs. Would type checking then effectively take place during parsing? How would a type error in the parsed program be detected and thrown?\n\nWhat other interesting applications exist? In general, how do GADTs change the programming model?"
