    "text": "Exploring my experiences with mental illness\n\nMonthly Archives: July 2017\n\nI\u2019ve spent the last week mulling over the death by suicide of Linkin Park singer Chester Bennington. was one of those 90s kids who picked up their first album, Hybrid Theory, and I really loved their first few albums, though I started to drift away as time went on. There was something about the music, the lyrics, the power behind what was being sung that really spoke to me \u2013 probably because, whether I knew it or not, that was a relatively dark period in my life. For my last two years of high school \u2013 1996-98 \u2013 I was dealing with the fallout of having a thyroid condition that was mostly unmedicated, and a lot of the symptoms mimicked depression pretty well. This continued into college, where I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder when I was 20. I was not in a good place mentally, so many of the songs of Linkin Park spoke to me \u2013 Numb, Crawling, In The End, Somewhere I Belong\u2026 I didn\u2019t know much about Chester Bennington or his background, then, but the things he was singing about really felt close to my heart.\n\nHearing about his suicide was kind of a blow because of that impact his music had on me. I\u2019ve learned more about who he was and what he had dealt with in his own life over the last week, and I can see now why his songs touched me \u2013 because it seems like he had many of the same kinds of feelings I did. And I\u2019ve attempted suicide myself, as well as lost a close friend to it, so I know what it can feel like to be on both sides of that divide. I even managed to have an acquaintance-ending argument with someone on social media because of the way they reacted to Mr. Bennington\u2019s death; they asserted that his choice was weak, selfish, and a ticket straight to hell, and I strenuously disagreed.\n\nI can\u2019t speak to what Mr. Bennington felt; I never met him, and I only really know him through his music. But the idea that suicide is somehow weak or selfish is one that just burns me up. For me, and for some other people who have contemplated (or attempted) suicide that I have spoken with, suicide is a solution of last resort, when the pain \u2013 usually emotional and mental \u2013 just becomes too hard to deal with. It\u2019s not a spur-of-the-moment decision, but usually comes with prolonged suffering. Only it is suffering that others can\u2019t see, and it is suffering that often those who suffer can\u2019t (or don\u2019t feel they are able to) show, because of how that suffering is perceived. There\u2019s a sort of societal assumption that \u2018real\u2019 suffering has to have a visible component; a broken limb, a huge gash, even a tumor. If it can\u2019t be seen, then, some assume, it must not be real, it\u2019s just imaginary.\n\nWhile yes, it is all in the heads of those who are suffering, that doesn\u2019t make it any less real. Being in one\u2019s head does not somehow make suffering imaginary. But when people feel like their pain won\u2019t be taken seriously, they keep it inside, and that just lets it grow and fester, like an infected wound \u2013 only there is no iodine or antibiotic for emotional trauma. People living with that pain fight a daily battle just to be even marginally functional, and when you\u2019re fighting a part of your own brain, there\u2019s really only so long you can keep fighting without help. For some that means medication, others therapy, still others can find some activity to help, and a combination works for many. But it\u2019s not weakness to give in after fighting a losing battle \u2013 if that were true, we\u2019d view the Spartans as weak for losing at Thermopylae.\n\nAs for selfishness, that\u2019s trickier. Suicide can appear selfish to someone who has never thought of it, and again, I can only go on my own experience and what has been told to me by others. But depression can get your mind so twisted up that you feel like a burden to others \u2013 your family, friends, the people you work with, even casual acquaintances. It feels like every time mention is made of how terrible one feels, that it is somehow a burden to those around us. So we pull back, and stop sharing, because we don\u2019t want to be a burden. but that puts more metaphorical weight on us, and we pull back more, until we become certain that removing ourselves from the lives of those we care for will be the best thing we can do for them. I know in my darkest times, I believed that my friends and family were so burdened by my presence and by the things in my head that my loss would actually be a comfort to them, that it would be a relief to not have to deal with my issues anymore. It seems nonsensical \u2013 how could someone we love and care for be such a burden that their death would be good for us? \u2013 but that\u2019s the insidious nature of depression. It twists our thoughts around to such a degree that up seems like down, black seems like white.\n\nDon\u2019t even bring up suicide being a trip straight to hell with me. I am a Christian, and I know that one can read one of the commandments \u2013 \u2018thous shalt not kill\u2019 \u2013 to be a condemnation of not just murder, but suicide as well. I\u2019m familiar with the medieval treatment of suicide, seeing it as a crime against God and man alike, so much so that suicides were buried, not in graveyards, but at crossroads (discussed here). My response to any of that is this \u2013 that God, who is infinitely loving and compassionate, must see the pain that someone who died from suicide was in, and that they may not have been thinking clearly. Such a loving and compassionate deity would see that soul\u2019s pain and, instead of banishing them to hell, accept them into heaven, because surely they had already suffered enough. And a God who would condemn someone who died from suicide to an eternity in hell because they finally gave in to the pain they were suffering from is not a God I would feel is worthy of worship. There may be a theological argument for hell being self-imposed, that perhaps a person who died from suicide felt themselves unworthy of God\u2019s love and intentionally separate themselves from their deity, but I would think that in such a case, the door would still be left open to them. If you really want to have this argument with me \u2013 and I don\u2019t suggest it \u2013 it will start off hostile, and will probably involve a whole host of profanity. So let\u2019s move on, shall we?\n\nI\u2019m going into social work, as anyone who has read many of my previous entries will know, so therapy is what I want to be able to do. This is because I want to be able to reach out to people before they reach the point of no return; I\u2019ve been there, and I know how hard it can be to reach out, but having someone to talk to, who isn\u2019t going to judge you, make fun of you, or try to second-guess you, can be a godsend. I don\u2019t know how Mr. Bennington handled his feelings, and I wish he hadn\u2019t died the way he did, but I know the demons that can be crawling in our skin. I know there are wounds that won\u2019t heal, that can\u2019t be seen. I know what it can be like to feel so numb that pain is the only thing that makes an impact, and death seems like the only answer. These are real things, even if they aren\u2019t visible, and there are millions of people in this country alone dealing with them every day.\n\nI welcome discussion here. If you have questions about my own experiences, please ask them. If you want to talk to me about anything, feel free to message me, and I\u2019ll answer. I know that here, I\u2019m just an anonymous voice on the internet, but I know that talking to someone else can help, even if only a little. I\u2019m not as eloquent in my handling of this topic as a former colleague of mine, one of the most intelligent and well-read people I have ever had the pleasure of learning alongside, who covered this in his own way with The Grendel Crawling In Our Skin: In Memory of Linkin Park\u2019s Chester Bennington. And I know that for people who are suffering from thoughts like this, it can often be nigh-impossible to reach out, even to someone who may have an idea what they are going through. I\u2019m sorry; I wish the internet allowed me to just step through it and sit with you through your pain, and do what I can to help. But right her, right now, this is what I can do.\n\nGoodbye, Mr. Bennington. Your music helped me through some very difficult periods in my life, and I know it helped many others. Your music helped inspire the work of another of my favorite artists, Icon for Hire (whose singer did her own cover of Numb several years ago); many of their songs are about dealing with emotional issues and mental well-being. It may not have helped you, but it did reach many who might otherwise have felt alone in their suffering. Wherever you are, I hope you have found some measure of peace."
