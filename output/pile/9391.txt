    "text": "Doctor Who: Jodie Whittaker Officially Your New Doctor\n\nThe next Doctor has been announced, and for some, it\u2019s completely out of left field. Enter actress Jodi Whittaker. Peter Capaldi\u2014who plays Doctor Number 12\u2014is set to step out of the Tardis once last time this year in the Doctor Who Christmas special and fans were speculating who is replacement would be.\n\nTo back up for a minute (SPOILERS); the last time we left the Doctor, he had just defeated the Cybermen once again with the aid of his companions and two versions of his arch nemesis, The Master\u2026you ready that right, two of them. The classic act of regeneration kicked in because of the damage The Doctor sustained, but this time The Doctor refused to change.\n\nNews of Capaldi leaving the show ramped up bets on who would take up the mantel. Many said it was time for an actor of color to take the role while others wanted an actress to play the character as it had been long overdue.\n\nAs always, the crowds are left with their heads scratching on who is Jodi Whittaker\u2014when announced\u2014 and to that I say,\n\n\u201cWatch Attack the Block and especially BBC\u2019s Broadchurch.\u201d\n\nWhittaker\u2019s performance is absolutely brilliant in the show which co-stars another former Doctor, David Tennant.\n\nThe introduction of a female Time Lord is not set outside the realm of possibility as the recent years have brought in Missy, a female version of The Master, that some would say was played amazingly well by actress Michelle Gomez.\n\nWhittaker, 35, said it was \u201cmore than an honour\u201d; to become the Doctor and I would have to add that it\u2019s going to be an interesting and most likely a fantastic performance from her.\n\nWelcome aboard Jodie Whittaker, you\u2019ll fit in just fine among the past Doctors.\n\nJodi Whittaker will make her regeneration debut this year when Peter Capaldi bids farewell during the Christmas Day show.\n\nManaging Editor, Writer\nLifelong film fanatic, Mark Salcido was discovered frozen in carbonite by C.H.U.Ds. He was released to the surface level to spread his rants and opinions on anything of film and digital. Batman calls him for advice."
