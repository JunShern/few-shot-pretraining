    "text": "There is an increasing amount of noise surrounding \u201cfreedom of speech,\u201d \u201cfake news,\u201d and everyone\u2019s right to be heard. This has particular bearing on the gaming community, where the term \u201cfreedom of speech\u201d is often used incorrectly.\n\nOn the other hand, online personalities are often playing a role in game marketing, and issues with GamerGate and other hate groups latching onto gaming means that games, studios and publishers are confronted with the task of moderating community and forum posts and interactions while being told they are censoring others. Hence, depriving someone of their right to free speech.\n\nAs an entertainment attorney with over seven years of experience in a practice dedicated exclusively to gaming culture and industry, this has been an ongoing cause for concern. It\u2019s an issue my clients face daily.\n\nLegally, there\u2019s no argument to be had. Let me explain why.\n\nNo One is Entitled to a Platform\n\nFelix Kjellberg, aka PewDiePie, blamed the press immediately after apologizing for his bad judgement, which brings up some interesting legal points about his situation.\n\nHe seemed to be operating under the assumption that the Wall Street Journal and mainstream media intentionally destroyed his business relationships. However, based on his own explanation, it\u2019s more than likely he broke his contract under any number of contract theories, as we\u2019ll examine below.\n\nThis was my first notice of PewDiePie, so I\u2019m not bringing any baggage into this debate. I don\u2019t like him or dislike him. I just know he\u2019s being widely discussed, and I\u2019m familiar with the legal aspects of these situations.\n\nHis departure from Google and Disney seems like a no-brainer to anyone with a basic understanding of entertainment contracts. His first mistake likely came from his presumption that either Google or Disney have a sense of humor, or value him for his comedic chops.\n\nCompanies typically won\u2019t support you when doing so will harm their brand or otherwise expose them to liability\n\nThe contracts he signed with Google (through YouTube) and Disney (through Maker Studios) should have made it apparent that they do not. Any tolerance on their part would be based on financial interest, not out of any respect for his freedom of expression or his budding career as a \u201crookie comedian.\u201d That is not the business they are in, as evidenced by how quickly they dropped him when his humor became a liability.\n\nCompanies typically won\u2019t support you when doing so will harm their brand or otherwise expose them to liability. That\u2019s why YouTube has a code of conduct, and why most contracts for endorsement include rather robust non-disparagement/no disparaging effect clauses. Disney includes this in its terms of use:\n\n\u201cYou may not submit or upload User Generated Content that is defamatory, harassing, threatening, bigoted, hateful, violent, vulgar, obscene, pornographic, or otherwise offensive or that harms or can reasonably be expected to harm any person or entity, whether or not such material is protected by law.\u201d\n\nOr, if you\u2019d like a more direct example from one of my own agreements:\n\n\u201cInfluencer may not: [\u2026.] engage in conduct or a pattern of behavior that may: (i) diminish Influencer\u2019s reputation as a personality in the gaming community; or (ii) as a result of [Company\u2019s] association with Influencer, harm [Company\u2019s] reputation.\u201d\n\nTypically a non-disparagement clause won\u2019t act alone to limit influencer conduct in an agreement. Some agreements will include strong \u201cmoral\u201d clauses, broad warranties and representations, and at will termination as additional means of controlling the influencer or providing backers a buffer if the Influencer\u2019s conduct creates a problem.\n\nFor example, a moral provision may prohibit an influencer from engaging in behavior in his or her private life that may amount to a scandal, while almost any reps and warranties provision will include a proviso prohibiting content that is defamatory or otherwise subject to legal action. The goal is to make sure, if you get into a scandal, you can be cast off quickly and with little legal repercussion.\n\nRead every word of your contract\n\nIn the interest of fairness, it is possible that the relevance of such provisions weren\u2019t made clear to Kjellberg. In an effort to court lucrative talent, backers may treat such verbiage as boilerplate until and unless something triggers it. I\u2019ve heard \u201cthey said we don\u2019t need to worry about that part,\u201d from more than a few clients.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t absolve responsibility on the part of the talent. You should read and treat as enforceable anything you want to sign. If you\u2019re not sure, consult an attorney and save yourself trouble down the road. However, it\u2019s generally common sense that companies like Google and Disney are in this for two main reasons: it helps their bottom line, and it\u2019s good for brand building.\n\nWhen an influencer under contract does something that harms that brand, that influencer is materially breaching their contract. That means termination.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that the relationship can still be repaired. However, he broke the rule any competent attorney would advise in a matter concerning an open dispute: the less you say, the better. An eight minute diatribe placing blame on third parties and treating your business partners as complicit in the conspiracy against you probably isn\u2019t going to help smooth this out.\n\nThus my surprise when Kjellberg admitted that his content was offensive and he crossed the line, that he exhibited poor judgment and that his amateurish attempt at comedy was a failure. He effectively admitted to breaching his contracts with Disney and Google, and then immediately sought to blame the press.\n\nThe context for his \u201cjoke,\u201d and whether mainstream media took it out of context, never really had anything to do with it. It\u2019s reasonable for companies like Disney and Google to consider mainstream media as the litmus test for what is considered offensive; their respective brands cater to a far broader demographic than PewDiePie\u2019s followers, after all.\n\nWelcome to the wonderful world of entertainment, Felix. You\u2019ve joined an elite club of performers, comedians and artists who crossed the line. No one is entitled to a platform, and your platform is a privilege that you will lose if you breach the terms under which that platform operates. In all likelihood you broke your contract. You even explained how you broke that contract in a video. It\u2019s irrational to conclude that a third party is responsible for the failure of your contract.\n\nThis Has Nothing to do With Free Speech\n\nMore alarming is the response by supporters, or rather, the response against detractors. The idea that companies or institutions are infringing on someone\u2019s freedom of speech is commonly expressed, often in very strong language. When Twitter banned Milo Yiannopolous, we heard the same refrain. Kjellberg himself has already confirmed that a subset of his fan base consists of white supremacists. As many of us have witnessed, that particular subset is known to be more vocal about a perceived injustice than your average netizen.\n\nLet me go ahead and get this out of the way:\n\nA private individual\u2019s right to tell you to shut up, and a company\u2019s right to censor your offensive content, are both protected by the first amendment.\n\nIf a client of mine terminates a player\u2019s subscription because they violated a game\u2019s code of conduct by spamming a chat channel with anti-Semitic rhetoric, they are well within their contractual rights to terminate that subscription. Your participation on a platform like Twitter, YouTube or one of the excellent games offered by my clients, however, is not. That is strictly governed by the Terms of Service or EULA you agree to when you sign up.\n\nIf you are an Influencer, your continued support from your backers is contingent on your compliance with whatever non-disparagement language you\u2019ve agreed to. Almost every platform available to you is offered by a private entity. Surprise! Welcome to Capitalism!\n\nThe first amendment isn\u2019t prohibitive against society at large; it protects society from government action. This typically shouldn\u2019t be a point of confusion, as the text itself is clear and unequivocal:\n\n\u201cCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\u201d\n\nThe context of \u201cfree speech,\u201d in roughly every territory where free speech exists, is uniformly a limitation on government power to suppress that right. Your personal feelings about censorship notwithstanding (or mine, for that matter), your only recourse against censorship on a platform provided by a private company is to not use that platform. There is no legal recourse. In fact, if there were, that really would violate the First Amendment. Clearly no one wants that.\n\nWhen someone decries \u201ccensorship\u201d and claims \u201cfree speech,\u201d they generally are not talking about the right to say what they want. They are talking about the right to say what they want wherever they want to share it, and that is a distinction that crosses the line between \u201cfundamental human right\u201d and \u201cmoral rationalization.\u201d\n\nNo one is morally obligated to listen to another person\u2019s opinion. No one should feel morally obligated to offer a platform for someone\u2019s message when they consider that message offensive. Freedom of speech does not place one person\u2019s rights above another person\u2019s right, simply because the other provides the platform. That rationale subverts the fundamental right to freedom of speech generally.\n\nWhat does this all mean?\n\nWe like to see the Internet as an open platform for the free exchange of ideas. Many of the companies who make the Internet possible, and they are each and every one private corporations, do their best to make that a reality.\n\nBut as we begin to recognize the risks associated with that free exchange, companies must take measures to safeguard the privacy and happiness of their consumers. This necessarily means censoring the content shared online. We are comfortable with censorship intended to protect us (e.g., prohibitions against sharing your personally identifiable information, passwords, etc. online), but we are less comfortable with censorship designed to protect others (e.g., codes of conduct).\n\nThe bottom line is that when you engage in free speech online, you typically do so as a consumer of the platform you are using. Normally you won\u2019t have the opportunity to negotiate the contracts you are bound to (whether it be a ToS or EULA) when you use those services.\n\nEven the most successful influencers, Kjellberg included, are bound by provisions that limit their behavior. Ironically, they are often subject to greater restrictions because of their influence on the brand. The reality is that your right to free speech may directly conflict with the agreement you\u2019ve entered, and engaging in some kinds of speech will almost certainly cost you a contract."
