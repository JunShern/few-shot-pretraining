Sporting over 200 music selections, the AMI has been fully restored by Games Room Company engineers, with all the classic features intact. A spectacular analogue sound system produces a deeper, richer \u2018vinyl to valve\u2019 sound.\n\nThe jukebox shows its \u201950s roots with an iconic automobile screen and a lit pierced chrome bumper. Triangular patterned motifs liberally decorate the cabinet, which is finished with sparkling, finely illuminated \u2018jewels\u2019 for a bit of fifties chic.\n\nThe AMI is a souvenir hailing from the Golden Age of Jukeboxes; a highly collectable and truly ageless product, available in finishes of spearmint green, and pink and black.\n\nWe also provide a record sourcing and title strip service to owners of 100 Selection Vinyl jukeboxes, and this breaks down into 3 separate stages dependent upon how much assistance you need.\n\nStage 1 - Title strip service.\n\nWhilst much of the character of your jukebox can be attributed to its unique sound and vintage styling, we have always considered it important to maintain the retro vibe by fitting authentically presented music title strips in the machine\u2019s window. After all, these will be the immediate focus of attention for anyone making their selections. To this end, we offer a title strip service whereby all 200 track names and artists are typed out and trimmed to size. (A jukebox which holds 100 records effectively offers 200 selections, including the A and B sides, and each strip displays both tracks) We use a 'typewriter-style' font appropriate to the period and the strips themselves incorporate retro-styled borders.\n\nIf the jukebox has been purchased from The Games Room Company the strips will also be inserted in the display panels.\n\nStage 2 - Title strips and music sourcing\n\nAt this level we undertake the service described above, whilst also sourcing and buying 100 records in the requested genre. Please note that this does not include the sourcing of any specific tracks.\n\nStage 3 - Sourcing records to order\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for specific music we can generally get hold of most tracks, and these will be the original 45\u2019s. This is charged on a per record basis, and sadly we are not able to guarantee the quality of the B side. The A side, i.e. your requested track, will however be scratch free and of sound quality.\n\nThe cost of these services in set out in the menus on the right.\n\nThe Games Room Company is one of the oldest jukebox dealers in the country. Our founder, Reginald Waldersmith, first learned about jukeboxes in the early 1950s when we were servicing jukeboxes on American Air Force bases. We\u2019ve been selling jukeboxes since 1962, so know a thing or two about our products! Our showroom will gladly assist you on any questions you may have before or after you purchase any Games Room Company equipment.\n\nCOOKIE POLICY: WE USE COOKIES ON THIS WEBSITE.
