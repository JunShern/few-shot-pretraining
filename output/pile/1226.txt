Pushing this to the rest of the web will mean I'll\nmiss real errors through the noise because they happen so infrequently that\nI'll just stop checking if every website has a red icon.\n\n~~~\nbriansmith\nBrowsers completely stop the page from loading and show a full-page error for\na certificate error. There's a huge difference between that and a small icon\nin the location bar. Plus, if the red icon that is suggested in that bug\nreport is too loud, a less loud indicator could be used instead.\n\nThere's a lot more to designing a UI for this than just changing the icon. For\nexample, when you type \"foo.com\" into the address bar, browsers generally\ndefault to \"[http://foo.com\"](http://foo.com\") instead of\n\"[https://foo.com.\"](https://foo.com.\") And, consequently, browsers tend to\nshow \"[http://foo.com\"](http://foo.com\") as \"foo.com\" to suggest that you\ndon't need to type the \"[http://\"](http://\") part. All of that needs to change\nto become a lot smarter in order for this type of idea to succeed. However, it\ndoesn't seem completely unreasonable to consider making all those changes. In\nfact, I think these changes should be a high priority for browsers makers.\n\ntl;dr: I suggest people brainstorm ways to improve upon the idea to make it\nworkable, instead of trying to shoot it down.\n\n~~~\ncodezero\nHonestly, I'd prefer a heuristic that could determine whether https was\nsignificant on the current URL. Are there submitted values, cookies of\nimportance, get parameters? There are a lot of reasons https is important and\nthere are a lot of places where it's totally not important.\n\nIf you draw people's attention to something that isn't seriously important,\nthen those times when the whole screen sends a warning you go, \"oh well, I had\nthat red warning going all along and it didn't matter, so why do I care?\"\n\nI am saying that by pushing a warning where it's not necessary, you diminish\nthe value of any warning.\n\n~~~\nbriansmith\n> There are a lot of places where it's totally not important.\n\nSee my other replies on this page for some reasons why I think there are no\npages where HTTPS is not important.\n\nI agree with you regarding the UI issues and the potential to generate apathy\nby crying wolf. That's why I think that the specifics of the linked-to\nproposal won't work. But, I think the general idea is worth investigating. It\njust requires some user research.\n\nAlso, the fact that browsers support a non-HTTPS mode at all is really the\nbigger UI issue. Imagine if HTTPS was the only option. The biggest UI security\nproblems would instantly vanish! That's a big reason why a lot of people are\nactively working so hard on finding ways to make HTTPS work for everybody on\nevery site.\n\n------\nmplewis\nPutting a red icon on 90% of all websites means the meaning of the icon will\njust saturate and people won't pay attention to the red icon any more.\n\n~~~\nbriansmith\nFWIW, ~33% of all pages are loaded over HTTPS already in Firefox, according to\nthe metrics collected by the browser. And, over 50% of all HTTP requests\n(including subresources like images and scripts embedded on a page) are over\nHTTPS, again according to the usage data collected by the browser.\n\n~~~\nscrollaway\nI'd be willing to bet quite high all these HTTPS requests are all on the same\nspecific services (facebook, gmail, google would already take most of them).\n\n------\ndanso\nNo.\n\nNot all sites exchange data worth the SSL-layer...let's say, 30-50% of the\nsites...that means for roughly half a user's non-email/social-networking web-\nbrowsing, they're going to either be saturated with a warning message that, if\npsychology research is to believed, is going to be promptly ignored like your\napartment's super-sensitive smoke detector or the boy watching out for wolves.\n\nWhat's the actual reasoning in OP's mind here? That the average web user is\nsomeone who, when the computer gives some warning sign that is disconnected\nfrom any kind of discernable threat, that the user will automatically take it\nseriously? That they'll demand to know why they're in danger, and then will\nrise up and petition the Internet regulatory commission to make all sites do\nwhat it takes to make that red icon go away, and the web will be more secure?\n\nI don't want to be overtly negative towards well-intended idealism, but this\nis such a bizarrely naive viewpoint that it must be openly challenged. That,\nand it just blithely ignores all the research showing what happens when humans\nare overloaded with impotent warning signs. This is the kind of idealism-\nwithout-consequences that can end up causing more harm than good.\n\n~~~\nscrollaway\nThis is not a user-oriented proposal, this is clearly directed at the website\nowners which are not going to want _their_ users to see red stuff on the URL\nbar.\n\n~~~\ndanso\nNot a bad strategy. Until the website owners take the path of least resistance\nbetween:\n\nA. Reconfiguring their stack to use SSL.\n\nB. Putting a Javascript-powered banner helpfully informing all Firefox users\nthat their browser has a security flaw (\"that's why that red icon is there\")\nand they should follow the included hyperlinks to install the latest versions\nof Internet Explorer or Chrome and then delete Firefox from their systems.\n\n~~~\nscrollaway\nThat B strategy might have worked a few years back for grandmas that got\nFirefox installed by their geeky grandson, but Firefox is popular now. And\npeople (geek or no geek) don't like being told the stuff _they_ use is not\ngood.\n\nHere's an experiment you can do at home: Try telling an emacs user Vim is\nbetter.\n\n------\nomni\nWhy should my blog of static pages need to be served over HTTPS to avoid\nhaving Firefox slap a scary red icon next to it?\n\n~~~\nscrollaway\nWhy shouldn't it is the real question.\n\nThere's a parallel universe where ssh is plaintext, and only \"sensitive\ncommands\", such as \"sudo\", are encrypted. In that universe though, plaintext\nHTTP doesn't exist and they're making fun of us.\n\n~~~\nmynameisvlad\nBecause no sensitive content is being transferred. Why put the extra hassle of\ngetting and installing a non-self-signed certificate for a blog where the user\ndoesn't even submit data? There's no reason for that connection to be secure.\n\n~~~\nscrollaway\n> Because no sensitive content is being transferred.\n\nYou're answering \"why\" instead of answering \"why not\" again. \"Why should you\nlock your door if you don't have anything expensive?\"\n\nPlaintext HTTP should not exist, then we wouldn't be having this discussion. I\nwouldn't have to come up with elaborate scenarios where having HTTPS from the\nget go would have saved lives, and you wouldn't have to come up with crazy\n\"but that'll never happen\" retort to them.\n\nUnfortunately, plaintext HTTP exists, so here we are, with me telling you that\nthe pro-gay rights piece you wrote on your static blog contains keywords that\nmake it be viewed as extremism/terrorism by Russia's automated monitoring\nsystems and anyone reading it gets immediately added to a watchlist.\nUnfortunately, a few of your readers are from russia and six months later\nthose readers join a political protest against the killing of kittens or\nsomething. Their government notices that and makes sure to \"take action\". And\nto think HTTPS could have avoided that.\n\n~~~\nYver\n> \"Why should you lock your door if you don't have anything expensive?\"\n\nLocks come standard on every door, they don't expire after a given time and\nevery child knows how to use them. See how your comparison to acquiring,\nsetting up and maintainning an SSL certificate is nonsensical?\n\n> And to think HTTPS could have avoided that.\n\nIf the NSA tags people who look for info on TOR as extremists, an hypothetical\nstate might tag people who use HTTPS. And to think that HTTP could have\navoided that! I mean, if every argument is an hypothetical, anything is\npossible.\n\n~~~\nscrollaway\nIf HTTPS is used globally, people can't be flagged for using it (or the flags\nend up being useless). Right now, you are correct, people could hypothetically\nbe flagged for using HTTPS. This would not happen if every static blog and\nwhat not out there would use it.\n\nThank you for reinforcing my point, I appreciate the help.\n\n------\nrcthompson\nWhat about warning the user when they start to type in a login box on a non-\nhttps site? Browsers should already know what is a login box, since they know\nhow to prompt you to remember the password.\n\n~~~\ntimmclean\nSort of like what IE used to do the first time you submitted a form?\n\n[http://bmlinks-committee.jbmia.or.jp/eng/image/EnDlg03.gif](http://bmlinks-\ncommittee.jbmia.or.jp/eng/image/EnDlg03.gif)\n\n~~~\nscrollaway\nTalk about full circle.\n\n------\njohn2x\nThe proposed icon is hard to parse. Better an open lock? And maybe in orange\ninstead of jarring red.\n\nOr even better, make the secure icon something universally positive, like a\ngreen smiley face or a check mark. Then the insecure icon can be an orange sad\nface or X mark. (Lock icon can be ambiguous to non-techies. i.e. why is the\nurl locked? or is that a suitcase/purse?)\n\n------\nKarunamon\nGreeaaaat. Just what everyone needs. An extra expense and further entrenchment\nof our exploitative CA system.\n\nI like this idea, but not when it puts more money in the pocket of the CAs.\n\n~~~\nscrollaway\nIf a better/broader alternative to CAs comes along and is adopted (say, such\nas SPDY), I take it the icon would behave the same way. Your comment is really\nunwarranted...\n\nNot to mention this is just some random guy. It's not like mozilla is actually\nthinking about this (they really should).\n\n~~~\nKarunamon\n>Your comment is really unwarranted...\n\nNot really - changes like this don't exist in a vacuum. Anything that makes\nthe existing CA's more indispensable (say, by driving customers their way by\nmaking it appear bad to not do business with them) is a net negative.\n\n------\nkbaker\nThey should at least wait for DANE + DNSSEC, which is a tangible (and free)\nalternative to the CA system, even though it would still be quite a bit of\neffort.\n\nI'd be curious to know how this would affect local servers in the intranet.\nSurely we wouldn't want to have to start issuing certs for everything inside\nthe firewall as well?\n\nI think this is a bit too shortsighted of a bug report. Anyways, since this is\nnot an official proposal, I think it will just be closed as invalid by\nMozilla.\n\n------\npeterkelly\nI vote for the NSA logo\n\n"
