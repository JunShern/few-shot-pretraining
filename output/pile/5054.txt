    "text": "President Trump Donald John TrumpOmar fires back at Trump over rally remarks: 'This is my country' Pelosi: Trump hurrying to fill SCOTUS seat so he can repeal ObamaCare Trump mocks Biden appearance, mask use ahead of first debate MORE\u2019s unexpected victory in 2016 was in no small part due to his promise to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d in Washington. And among members of the White House Cabinet, no agency head has done more to follow the president\u2019s lead in draining the swamp than Scott Pruitt Edward (Scott) Scott PruittJuan Williams: Swamp creature at the White House Science protections must be enforceable Conspicuous by their absence from the Republican Convention MORE, who leads the Environmental Protection Agency. Make no mistake, that\u2019s why the left and its allies in the media are working overtime to smear him.\n\nThey know he\u2019s being effective \u2014 perhaps the most effective member of Trump\u2019s Cabinet when it comes to actually translating rhetoric into reality \u2014 and they know they cannot stop him, so in typical swamp fashion, they are intent on destroying him. After eight years under President Obama, Americans were fed up with being ordered around by liberal elites in a distant capital city, and by bureaucrats who put in place job-killing regulations and pushed policies that steadily reduced the number of Americans looking for work year after year, all while calling it \u201cprogress.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPresident Trump has reversed that. He has led the way on draining the swamp, with a White House directive to agencies to cut two regulations for every new regulation proposed, with tax reforms that simplify the tax code and allow Americans to keep more of their hard-earned paychecks, and with decisions like the one he made to remove the United States from the unfair and ineffective Paris climate accord.\n\nAt the EPA, one of the very worst of the alphabet soup bureaucratic fiefdoms that make up the swamp, Pruitt took charge and immediately focused on returning the agency to its stated goals of improving air quality, shoring up our water infrastructure, and cleaning up contaminated areas. This was a huge change after the Obama administration, which used the EPA to issue volumes of job-killing regulations to mollify environmental extremists. Among its most egregious efforts, it utilized \u201csue and settle\u201d practices to abuse legal limits on rulemaking and reward ideological allies.\n\nIn his first year in charge of the EPA, Pruitt finalized more than 20 deregulatory actions, saving taxpayers more than $1 billion in regulatory costs. He also ended the \u201csue and settle\u201d practices. The agency is rescinding and replacing the ridiculous and onerous \u201cWaters of the United States\u201d rule, and acting on President Trump\u2019s order to review and overturn the Obama administration\u2019s so-called \u201cClean Power Plan.\u201d\n\nDelivering these results has put a \u201cyuge\u201d target on Pruitt\u2019s back. The environmental left, liberal bureaucrats and academics, and their allies in the media have been relentlessly attacking him in what appears to be a coordinated media assault, but he won\u2019t back down and he won\u2019t be intimidated. This year, Pruitt is ensuring the EPA adheres to the rule of law and continues to remove burdensome regulations that are harming workers and consumers. Just this week, the EPA announced its decision not to move forward with the Obama administration\u2019s anti-consumer fuel efficiency standards, which could have harmed consumers by artificially driving up the price of American cars and trucks.\n\nLikewise, in a huge blow to the environmental left, Pruitt has announced the agency will end the use of \u201csecret science\u201d \u2014 data that is not subject to public scrutiny \u2014 in crafting new rules for the agency. In a recent interview, Pruitt said, \u201cWe need to make sure their data and methodology are published as part of the record. Otherwise, it\u2019s not transparent. It\u2019s not objectively measured, and that\u2019s important.\u201d More transparency in decision-making at an agency under as much pressure from activists as the EPA is critical to ensuring taxpayers and consumers aren\u2019t harmed by rulemaking gone amok.\n\nIn spite of his coming under attack from the radical left and their allies in the liberal media, Pruitt is making real progress for the American people at an agency that the left believes it alone should run and control. President Trump unified a governing coalition behind the promise of draining the swamp in Washington, and of all his Cabinet members, Scott Pruitt has done the most to help him advance the cause.\n\nJenny Beth Martin is chairman of Tea Party Patriots Citizens Fund."
