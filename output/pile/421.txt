    "text": "A man loses the woman he intends to marry.A woman loses her best friend.\nRetired Army Captain Liam Brosnan and US Marshal Chelsea Kilpatrick are forced to question what they know about a murder that forces them together. Uncertain connections from Liam\u2019s military career rope them into a cloak-and-dagger investigation that offers more questions than answers.\n\nBeing duty-bound while in the throes of grief is a dangerous mixture. They struggle with unexpected sparks of passion and question their loyalty to a woman they loved while a murderer closes in on his next target.\n\nWill the explosive solace Liam and Chelsea find in one another lead to a love neither expected? Or will it blind them to looming danger and death?\n\nCristin Harber\u2019s larger-than-life military/terrorism conspiracy plots often skirt closer to the edge of the unbelievable than many of the books I\u2019ve gone through but then again, that\u2019s part of the basis of the romantic suspense genre: the homing in on particular individuals upon whom the fate of the country or the world hangs, no matter how ludicrous the situation might be (even when the connections are far from water-tight).\n\nYet \u2018The Savior\u2019 is an intriguing start to a new series that I\u2019m curious enough to want to continue: the somewhat taboo attraction between a retired army captain and a federal agent, brought together ironically by the death of the death of his girlfriend (who also happened to be latter\u2019s best friend).\n\nChelsea Kilpatrick and Liam Brosnan do make a good pairing somehow, especially so after Liam learns that the tragedy they\u2019d both lived through was in fact, premeditated\u2026and carefully planned over a few years.\n\nPile on the guilt, the hesitation, the electric sexual tension and a mite bit of push-pull. The icky dead-partner as the third party vibe isn\u2019t altogether absent, nonetheless. We\u2019re not quite given much of their history together however, only that they knew each other marginally through Julia, yet Liam and Chelsea \u2018adulted\u2019 quite well and I liked their inadvertent (and fairly mature) way of dealing with their burgeoning attraction to each other.\n\nWhat was strangely surprising was the lack of action that brought the steady pace to a sort of lull until the last quarter of the book as things pulled together. (I didn\u2019t get the Vietnamese-sounding terrorist names, by the way.) Harber\u2019s writing style did feel somewhat \u2018off\u2019 and uneven at times though: some collocations didn\u2019t quite make sense logically if you actually think carefully about it, or the moments where more was needed but wasn\u2019t given and vice versa. Some were even jarring enough to kick me out of the narrative; well, the whole point being, I did think a finer-toothed comb was necessary in weeding out these errors, developmental or otherwise.\n\nBeing cautiously optimistic about this new series is what I\u2019m left with by the end, abrupt as it seemed.\n\nColin questioned his recruitment to Delta team from day one, but he's made sure to earn his accomplishments twice over. No one could accuse his diplomat father of pulling strings.\n\nFalling for Adelia is everything he never planned and always wanted. No complications. No agenda. Just a sweet girl who made him smile.\n\nBut Adelia has spun a network of lies around the world to help save women from human traffickers, and she's stolen from Mayhem motorcycle club, the men who saved her life, to do it. Anonymous friends back her unseen good deeds\u2014until a link snaps. Actions have consequences in the Mayhem MC world. The repercussions are deadly.\n\nEverywhere she turns, the fallout ripples. Friends become enemies. Family walks away. There's no one left to save her except for the man she's fallen in love with, and she'd do anything to keep him from Mayhem's ricochet.\n\n\u2018Delta: Ricochet\u2019 started out well enough, but this is my dislike for MCs-type stories speaking here, which Cristin Harber has integrated more and more into her Delta series with the longstanding topic of human trafficking taking priority in the last few of these books. I definitely prefer Harber\u2019s Titan storylines that are more in the grain of the type of romantic suspense that I like to read, and clearly this preference is what\u2019s partially accounting for my rating.\n\nUndoubtedly, the setup of Colin\u2019s and Adelia\u2019s story is an intriguing one and it works well enough as a standalone since Harber does drop hints of what happened before. The first quarter brings Colin\u2019s and Adelia\u2019s paths together in way that is easy to follow (and is in my opinion, the best bit about the story which I sailed through), though their slow, slow burn does stretch past this mark. \u2018Ricochet\u2019 is however, a way longer read than what Harber typically churns out. Topping at 400+ish pages on my reader, however, my doubts crept in after I hit the 30% mark and my reading process faltered badly.\n\nThe funny thing about Harber\u2019s characters is that they don\u2019t necessarily behave the way and say the things you expect them to. \u2018Ricochet\u2019 isn\u2019t too different, but the result here is one of meandering dialogues, character responses that don\u2019t address questions head-on and a prolonging of the advancement of plot. The less-than-succinct delivery meant that a fair bit of editing\u2014for structure, for the huge number of writing errors that really, really shouldn\u2019t be there at this stage and for the roundabout dialogue\u2014would have streamlined the \u2018Ricochet\u2019 into a read that had less stutters and abrupt lulls as action scenes built and simply dwindled away.\n\nStill, the amount of riddles, courtesy of the work of secondary characters (which happily ran interference both for plot and structure) and Adelia\u2019s deliberate and frustrating-as-hell in-but-not-in stance with Colin tanked the whole story for me. If Adelia started out as a protagonist whom I admired, this soon changed after the extraordinary lengths she went to obfuscate what she\u2019d been doing all along in Mayhem when it became clear at a certain point that full disclosure (to the right parties) was needed.\n\nI\u2019m all for strong and independent heroines, don\u2019t get me wrong. But having said this before, I think this merits it being said again: such a character isn\u2019t afraid to ask for help, is brave enough to know when she is out of her depth and doesn\u2019t play games when time is of the essence\u2014all of which I thought Adelia fell alarmingly short of when the situation called for it. Calling for blind trust from Colin when she wouldn\u2019t give hers stank of hypocrisy, not to mention the mind-boggling idiocy she showed when she stubbornly decided to go at things on her own without asking for the support she knew she so badly needed. Acting the martyr (yes, a goodbye note was included) was not only unnecessary at this point, but the stupidity of it threw me off so much that I stopped reading completely as \u2018Ricochet\u2019 neared its climax.\n\nFrom a fantastic start to a muddling finish that soured quickly, \u2018Ricochet\u2019 capped off what has been a disappointing series for me, more so because Harber\u2019s earlier books had made me a stalwart fan of hers. Thus far, the later Titan books and the Delta series haven\u2019t run any bells for me to the point where I\u2019m almost wary to pick up another book of hers\u2026for fear of being disappointed once again.\n\nSeven is an enigma. A motorcycle club princess. The daughter of a notorious gangster. The best friend of the deputy mayor. A coffee shop owner. The single mom of two young, adopted children. She\u2019s colorful, in every way possible\u2014from her attitude to her piercings and bright pink hair\u2014and she\u2019s a woman on a mission with the power to help broker a clean break between a powerful motorcycle club and a South American drug cartel. But not all players are ready for the game to change, including the ones she can\u2019t see like the CIA. Jax Michaelson has a bad attitude and a good shot. The former Navy SEAL has been on Titan\u2019s problem list for running his mouth since the day he showed up for work, but he does a hell of a job, and they\u2019d never let him go. Call him cocky, that\u2019s fine, because then you\u2019d have to admit he\u2019s the best at anything and everything\u2014except diplomacy. When Titan is forced into the seedy drug world filled with cartel glitz and Harley-riding MCs, Seven and her family become an unexpected bargaining chip right after she and Jax find a way to stand each other\u2014in bed. Will friends become lovers? Or are they too far gone to be opposites that attract? Is Jax nothing but a bad boy who leaves her hoping for a military hero when the burden of living as Mayhem royalty backfires and her children disappear.\n\nOne consistent thing about Cristin Harber\u2019s characters is that they do tend to behave in ways I\u2019ll never expect. Jax and Seven are no exception to this general rule that I\u2019ve come to learn of the Titan gang; neither is the direction that Harber takes in this book that completely surprised me. Characters whom you thought you can\u2019t warm to can suddenly turn around and show that the notion of \u2018heroism\u2019 doesn\u2019t always conform to some pre-determined idea that you have\u2026though as much as I hate to say it, the opposite applies too.\n\nTitan\u2019s ops thus far have been more paramilitary covert ops, so when Jax\u2019s story came wrapped up in a MC\u2019s dealings, I couldn\u2019t say I was entirely enthusiastic about this turn, but it\u2019s clearly my own sub-genre preferences speaking here. Jax, the known arse and the bastard-to-go-to in the past few Titan books, had a story and I was itching to uncover it, and this itch surpassed even my general dislike for MC stories.\n\nThe result is an MC-centric book that I couldn\u2019t really get into but for Jax\u2019s and Seven\u2019s dance around each other and the fact that they aren\u2019t quite the stereotypical characters I tend to read in such stories. There is action, of course and Jared Westin\u2019s mobilisation of his Titan troops is always an awesome thing to read about, but that only comes much later\u2026past the talking, posturing and the laborious sifting through truth and lies.\n\nAbove all, Jax made the story for me, as self-titled as this books is anyway, I didn\u2019t expect anything different when Harber fleshed him out to be a protagonist who was so much more than his crusty, abrasive surface. I couldn\u2019t quite say the same for the rest of the characters, who were simply varying shades of unlikable. In fact, I cheered Jax for giving it stubbornly to the Titan team who admittedly hadn\u2019t been on his side to begin with and Jared/Sugar\u2014a couple whom I\u2019d adored when their book came out\u2014behaved in fact, like idiots for most of this, tarnishing the sheen of the halo I\u2019d initially put on them. Soon enough, it got just as hard to like Seven, whom I felt simply needed to grow a spine where Jax was concerned because she couldn\u2019t decide where her loyalties were going to lie when it was all said and done.\n\n\u2018Jax\u2019 is a very different type of Titan book for which I needed a huge effort to suspend disbelief. That Jax\u2019s so-called mortal enemy was dealt with all-too-easily\u2014he was flitted in and out, appearing to play an important role but didn\u2019t, and realising that he was ultimately, another plot device to help alter other characters\u2019 perception of Jax tanked the read for me.\n\nBut I\u2019ll reiterate that my own response to the plot and characters is just that\u2014a catalogue of issues that just didn\u2019t work for me, which simply outweighed Jax as the shining star of his own book and explains my half-hearted rating of it.\n\nThat was all that the woman would share when Delta team\u2019s expert trigger man, an Australian named Ryder, pulled her from the pits of a human trafficking nightmare and took the gun from her hand.\n\nHe didn\u2019t mean to steal her revenge but survival was the priority. Now that Victoria was home? She had a past he was trying to understand while keeping a secret from her that might tear her apart.\n\nBut he\u2019s not the only one. When she goes missing, Delta team discovers that Victoria No Name was a one-woman vigilante force, taking on whoever crossed her path, from gun runners to a drug pushing motorcycle club.\n\nShe was exactly who Ryder thought she might be, and now he was coming in to help\u2014whether she wanted backup or not.\n\nCristin Harber\u2019s books used to be like crack for me, though I\u2019ve got to admit that I\u2019ve been disappointed in them as the Titan series grows. Harber does write good suspense; everything that involves Titan is typically drawn out, fairly complex and what they do actually rolls out hypothetical scenarios that aren\u2019t too hard to envision coming true of late. \u2018Delta: Redemption\u2019 is Victoria/Ryder\u2019s book, 2 secondary characters that I\u2019d long forgotten about in Harber\u2019s previous book, but it wasn\u2019t hard to get caught up in the hostile Russian conspiracy in middle-America and the shady link to the brutal world of human trafficking.\n\nI liked the start of the story, as Cristin Harber portrayed a victim of circumstances and rape who\u2019d lost her self-confidence and her perceived standing in her small-town community. Both Ryder and Victoria\u2019s connection was\u2026for the want of a better word\u2026a sympathetic one which I thought I could relate to. Both had lost something/someone and Harber certainly writes that soul-deep connection between the both of them especially well as Victoria was recovering from her ordeal.\n\nBut it went downhill for me from that point onwards and yes, was Victoria herself who rubbed me the wrong way. Upfront, I felt the problem was her TSTL behaviour that proved to be the costly catalyst that helped account for the action that happened in the rest of the book. Insisting on going at things alone when she knew full well that she needed help on this was stupidity of epic proportions; going ahead full steam while actually condemning herself\u2013which shows some amount of perception that she wasn\u2019t doing it right\u2013for keeping things secret made it worse.\n\nThe need for revenge is always explained away as a lone-wolf, bloodthirsty, cannot-be-ignored trait and it\u2019s simply reiterated here with her PTSD seemed swept under the rug with a softly-softly approach that Titan gave her, as did her friend Seven, ironically proving exactly what she never wanted others to think of her from the start: helpless when it came to crunch time yet having no issues eluding and deceiving when it suited her, only to lead Titan/Delta to her rescue a second time.\n\nI\u2019m all for assertion of independence, though all too often it\u2019s done without thought, which then crosses the line straight into idiocy for me. \u2018Delta: Redemption\u2019 was to say the least, a read that didn\u2019t go down too well, though clearly, what I ranted above has been one of my personal beefs for a long time. I couldn\u2019t stop my eye-rolling for a long time, but as I\u2019ve always said, just because it didn\u2019t go too well for me, doesn\u2019t mean it wouldn\u2019t for others as well. In fact, I\u2019m quite happy to say the opposite, in fact, happens.\n\nTHE STOIC SPECIAL FORCES OPERATOR There\u2019s only one person to blame for darkening the last years of Locke Oliver\u2019s military career: Cassidy Noble. And damn if he doesn\u2019t have to save her from the side of a frozen mountain. Even after the job is done, he can\u2019t shake the woman from his thoughts. He blames her for the deaths in his Army unit so many years ago, and he\u2019s not ready to let that go. It\u2019s driving him to the point of distraction, and now his Titan Group boss says to get his act together or get out.THE FEISTY, FALLEN REPORTER Cassidy is a disgraced journalist, once accused of treason\u2014Or she\u2019s an American hero. It depends on who you ask. She\u2019s on a mission to rebuild her name and started with a simple question but discovered a complex web of spies and possible human trafficking. Titan Group believes in her. Locke does not. Until he can\u2019t deny the truth any longer about the past or what she\u2019s uncovered in her investigation.BECOME AN INSEPARABLE TEAM Cassidy volunteers to go undercover. Locke would do anything to stay by her side as she slips into the network and is sold to the highest bidder. All is going right until everything goes wrong. Nothing is as they expect, including falling in love with the woman he thought he hated.\n\nIt took me an extraordinarily long time to go through this book that I\u2019m actually wondering whether it\u2019s sort of the end of the Titan series for me right now.\n\nHaving been a fan of Titan in the early days, I wondered how Cristin Harber was going to go on with the series after Jared Westin\u2019s core team had found their respective HEAs. \u2018Locke and Key\u2019 is a book past that particular series arc but I\u2019ve been struggling since the chapter closed on the core team.\n\nI\u2019ve admittedly found myself lukewarm and half-hearted about the Titan series after Parker\u2019s book came out as a dud for me but the biggest problem in \u2018Locke and Key\u2019 was that I couldn\u2019t find any character likeable, despite them having been fantastic protagonists in their own time in previous books who have since undergone some personality transplants. Here, they came across as volatile idiots lacking compassion or any sense of kinship and that famous \u2018brotherhood-in-arms\u2019 spirit which I tend to read about in RS books seemed sorely lacking here. Instead, what I saw was loads of peacock strutting, macho posturing and too many over-the-top type of reactions that felt like petty and unnecessary squabbles.\n\nIn essence, the volatility of the characters\u2019 behaviours resulted in my own volatile reactions to difference scenes and dialogues. There were chapters that made me think I could get behind some characters and other chapters that had me rolling my eyes and ready to give up the book. The only things that kept me going were the secondary characters whose fight Titan inevitably became a part of to reunite their family and I read on, cheering for them alone.\n\nObviously, it\u2019s one of those books that grated on me, but I\u2019m hoping at least, that the overall sense of dissatisfaction with the series might pass. Whether there\u2019ll still be Titan or Delta in my to-be-read list however, well, that\u2019s still something that\u2019s up in the air for me.\n\nFrom Liliana Hart's New York Times bestselling MacKenzie family comes a new story by New York Times bestselling author Cristin Harber... When Luke Brenner takes an off-the-books job on the MacKenzie-Delta joint task force, he has one goal: shut down sex traffickers on his personal hunt for retribution. This operation brings him closer than he's ever been to avenge his first love, who was taken, sold, and likely dead. Madeleine Mercier is the daughter of an infamous cartel conglomerate. Their family bleeds money, they sell pleasure, they sell people. She knows no other life, sees no escape, except for one. Maddy is the only person who can take down Papa, when every branch of law enforcement in every country, is on her father's payroll. It's evil. To want to ruin, to murder, her family. But that's what she is. Ruined for a life outside of destroying her father. She can't feel arousal. Has never been kissed. Never felt anything other than disgust for the world that she perpetuates. Until she clashes with a possible mercenary who gives her hope. The hunter versus the virgin. The predator and his prey. When forced together, can enemies resist the urge to run away or destroy one another?\n\nIn the mad, mad world of Cristin Harber\u2019s Titan and Delta, very few things make sense in the logical realm, or at least that\u2019s the lesson I\u2019ve come to learn the further and deeper I get into the Titan books. A mercenary meets and falls in lust/love with the virgin daughter of a far-reaching human trafficker, and somehow thinks there is a common ground between his very unnatural addiction to pain and her own special brand of fighting back against her father.\n\nI\u2019ve come to associate these peculiar oddities and plot weirdness only with Ms. Harber: there\u2019re always switchbacks, unpredictable moves and odd behaviour patterns of the characters that I can\u2019t ever put my finger on \u2013 and perhaps this is a turn-on for some. Yet the brevity of the book sadly, hugely contributes to the unbelievability of the tale; as much as Ms. Harber\u2019s trademark, distinctive writing helps pad the surreal feel of the story, I was left sceptically scratching my head about Luke and Maddy\u2019s tenuous connection and a plot so fantastically crazy it can only belong in a James Bond spoof.\n\nParker Black wants the one woman he shouldn\u2019t have\u2014his buddy\u2019s girl. She's sweet and smart, but clueless about how deep Parker lives in Titan\u2019s virtual world. Everything is controlled. Chaos is mastered. Black and white data and risk analysis. That is the way he understands his world, how he plays his role to keep Titan teams alive.\nBut he\u2019s wrong.\nAbout everything.\nLexi Dare lives two lives. She\u2019s an unhappy fianc\u00e9e stuck in a spiraling relationship, unsure how she ended up with a ring on her finger and an abuser in her bed. But she\u2019s also elusive. Elite. A master hacker playing deadly stakes.\nWhen the lines blur and the truth comes out, Lexi\u2019s only shot at survival is the trust of her rival\u2014her equal\u2014before it\u2019s too late.\n\nGoing into Parker Black\u2019s world is like stepping into hacker central and BlackDawn, his virtual codename \u2013 unbeknownst to him \u2013 has actually been an anchor for another hacker named Silver Chaos for the past decade. But Silver Chaos is in fact, Lexi Dare, a woman who in real life, is a victim of abuse, and in the small world of Titan, Lexi also happens to be the fianc\u00e9e of Parker\u2019s friend Matt.\n\nOther Titan characters flit in and out of the story, but Black Dawn is really, a step away from an actual Titan op and into the fluid ethical boundaries of hacking and coding, a world that Parker has always believed is black and white. Parker\u2019s professional and personal lives are set on a collision course when Lexi stumbles into his life; discovering her true virtual identity pushes them into unimaginable danger just as his attraction to her spikes along the way.\n\nI thought this latest Titan installment was just entertaining as the previous Titan books have been, even if the action is over-the-top and require way more than a tad bit of suspension of disbelief, even if there\u2019re few principles of hacking and coding that I truly understand. Instead, I\u2019ve always been drawn to Titan\u2019s quirky characters, their funny names and their antics, especially the alpha men who are strangely unafraid to fall into their heroines\u2019 arms and call time on their bachelor status. Parker Black might be the latest, but hopefully not last to do so, if his story truly signals the end of the Titan series."
