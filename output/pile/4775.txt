I flew out with my mother on a trip to Rome, and there must have been something about the terminal that struck me, even then.\u201d\n\nStramaglia, a New Jersey resident, has thrown himself into a quixotic campaign to save the Pan Am Worldport from almost certain demolition by the New York/New Jersey Port Authority and Delta Air Lines, which now owns it. In 2011 he joined a grass-roots Save the Worldport campaign, founded by a former Pan Am employee, Kalev Savi.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a preservationist by trade,\u201d said Stramaglia. \u201cI\u2019m an IT guy. But this is something I latched on to. I have a close emotional tie with it.\u201d\n\nOpened on May 24, 1960, the Worldport conjures up images of a time when air travel was seen as sophisticated and glamorous. With its massive, cantilevered roof suspended over a structure of concrete and glass, the terminal is a sleek embodiment of 1960s style and the emergence of the Jet Age. Some call it a flying saucer; and for Stramaglia, it\u2019s a flying saucer worth saving.\n\n\u201cMidcentury modern is disappearing these days. Some of it is making a comeback with TV shows like 'Mad Men,' but we\u2019re afraid that if this goes it\u2019s going to be one of those Penn Stations,\u201d Stramaglia said, referring to New York City\u2019s original Pennsylvania Station, which was demolished in 1963.\n\n\u201cWith the Worldport, the threat was clearly dire and the significance of the place was really compelling to us,\u201d said Roberta Lane, spokesperson for the National Trust, told Yahoo News by phone. \u201cOur aim is to help people embrace modern design and to preserve our modernist heritage. The Worldport embodies the very best of the tradition that came out of the Jet Age, and it occupies a significant place in aviation history as well.\u201d\n\nStramaglia says he appreciates the publicity his cause has received, but he worries that it might be too late. According to the Times, workers have already started to remove asbestos and lead paint from the terminal to prepare for the wrecking crews.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not looking good at this point until we get in front of Delta,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know the terminal\u2019s obsolete as far as travel\u2014that\u2019s a given. But the saucer can be repurposed.\u201d\n\nSuggestions from the Save the Worldport campaign have included a museum as well as restaurants, shops and an observation space.\n\nThe organization has yet to receive a response from Delta on these proposals. And while Stramaglia and his team have spoken with the Port Authority on several occasions, they say that\u2019s not enough.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a small victory,\u201d said Stramaglia of those meetings. \u201cBut they can\u2019t do anything here\u2014they need the private funding from Delta.\u201d\n\nStill, the National Trust believes it can use its status as a top preservation advocacy group to rally support for the Worldport.\n\n\u201cRaising public awareness can be an extremely powerful thing, and we\u2019ve had a good record of that with our annual lists of endangered places,\u201d said Lane, who cited the successful refurbishment of JFK\u2019s futurist TWA Flight Center after that building appeared on the organization\u2019s 2004 list. \u201cThere\u2019s been a real groundswell for groups like Save the Worldport.\u201d\n\nMore than 6,700 people have joined the group\u2019s Facebook campaign, while an online petition has garnered signatures from almost 70 countries. Stramaglia said people aged 16 to 64 have signed the petition.\n\n\u201cIt shows you how much younger people care for the architecture and the history,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Worldport has been on the chopping block since 2001, when the Port Authority conducted an eligibility report on the terminal\u2019s status as a historical landmark. According to the Times, Delta plans to turn the site into a parking zone for its aircraft by 2015.\n\n\u201cThey said there\u2019s nothing original about the building,\u201d said Stramaglia of the Port Authority\u2019s 2001 report. \u201cThey said that the terminal\u2019s cantilevered roof and the suspension cables were something you see every day. They\u2019re not. Those techniques might be common in architecture, but it\u2019s the uniqueness of how they were applied here that makes the building special.\u201d"
