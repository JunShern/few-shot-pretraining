    "text": "Q:\n\nICommand vs IValueConverter\n\nI am new to WPF. I am currently developing an application in WPF where I had to enable/disable a button based on a value from database. I found solutions on the net to do so using Command as well as Converters. So which one is a better solution and why?\n\nA:\n\nWhen working with buttons it would be best to use the command implementation , since it is built in \nand you can provide a command parameter for predicate , the converter is something you would need to \nwrite , instance and place in each place you would wan't to use it .\nTo summarize a command with CanExecute would be more reusable and maintainable . \n\n"
