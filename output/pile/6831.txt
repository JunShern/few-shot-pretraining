    "text": "Energy dampening devices have been known for many years. A most common usage for such energy dampening devices is in the vehicle bumpers so that the force of impact will be dissipated by such energy dampening apparatus, thereby minimizing the actual damage to the motor vehicle. For example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,960,397 to Janci, 3,961,818 to Roth, 4,366,876 to Granig and 4,257,581 to Keeler are representative of such devices for absorbing shock and preventing damage to a motor vehicle by connecting such energy dampening devices to the bumper thereof."
