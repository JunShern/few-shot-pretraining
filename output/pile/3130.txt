Dunn) for the plaintiff;\n\n       Barnes, Richardson & Colburn (Frederick D. Van Arnam) for defendant Hartford Fire\nInsurance Company;\n\n       Defendant World Commodities Equipment Corp. did not participate in this action.\n\n\n       On July 16, 2007 the United States Department of Homeland Security, Customs and Border\n\nProtection (\u201cCBP\u201d or \u201cCustoms\u201d) filed with the Court a summons and complaint to enforce civil\n\npenalties and recover unpaid duties pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1592 (2000) for an entry of fresh garlic\n\nimported into the United States on July 16, 2002.1 Customs alleges that Defendant importer World\n\nCommodities Equipment Co. (\u201cWCE\u201d) attempted to enter the fresh garlic into the commerce of the\n\nUnited States by means of documents containing \u201cmaterial false statements\u201d showing that the garlic\n\noriginated from Mexico, when the actual country of origin was the People\u2019s Republic of China.\n\nCompl. at \u00b6 \u00b6 5, 7. However, Customs has apparently failed to effect service of process on WCE\n\nwithin the 120-day time period required by CIT Rule 4; currently before the court is Customs\u2019 out-of\n\n-time motion to serve the summons and complaint on WCE approximately one month beyond the\n\n120-day deadline.\n\n       Co-defendant surety Hartford Fire Insurance Co., (\u201cHartford\u201d) asserts that Customs\u2019 failure\n\nto effectuate service of process on WCE within the 120-day deadline requires dismissal as to WCE.\n\nHartford asserts further that if dismissal is granted as to WCE, the court must grant its motion to\n\n\n       1\n        Pursuant to the five-year statute of limitations provided in 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621, July 16,\n2007 was the last date in which the action could be filed.\n\fCourt No. 07-00263                                                                              Page 3\n\n\ndismiss the action against Hartford as well (pursuant to Rule 12(b)(5)) or, alternatively, \u201cto convert\n\nthis matter to summary judgment\u201d or decide the action in Hartford\u2019s favor based on the pleadings.\n\nHartford\u2019s Mot. In Opp. at 13. For the reasons set forth below, the court will (1) deny plaintiff\u2019s out-\n\nof-time motion and dismiss the matter as to WCE, and (2) deny Hartford\u2019s motion to dismiss.\n\n                                             Background\n\n       On July 16, 2007 Customs sent to Hartford and WCE a notice of the commencement of the\n\ncurrent action with a request that each of the defendants waive formal service of a summons. See\n\nCIT Rule 4(d). Defendant Hartford signed and returned the waiver on August 28, 2007; defendant\n\nWCE apparently never acknowledged receipt of those documents. Because WCE did not waive\n\nformal service of process, Customs was required, pursuant to CIT Rule 4(m), to formally serve the\n\nsummons and complaint on WCE within 120 days after the July 16, 2007 filing of the complaint.\n\nDay 120 fell on November 13, 2007, but Customs had not served WCE. On November 30, 2007,\n\nCustoms filed with the Court a pleading entitled \u201cPlaintiff\u2019s Out of Time Motion for Leave to Serve\n\nSummons and Complaint Out of Time on Defendant [WCE].\u201d In that motion, Customs states that\n\nthe summons and complaint had not been served on WCE, but that service was expected to occur\n\n\u201con or about December 3, 2007.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Out of Time Mot. at 1. Customs eventually served WCE on\n\nDecember 10, 2007.

Dismissal as to WCE\n\n       Rule 4(m) of the Court\u2019s Rules provides\n                      (m)   TIME LIMIT FOR SERVICE.\n\n                             If a service of the summons and complaint is not made\n               upon a defendant within 120 days after the filing of the complaint, the\n\fCourt No. 07-00263                                                                             Page 4\n\n\n               court upon motion or its own initiative after notice to the plaintiff,\n               shall dismiss the action without prejudice as to that defendant or\n               direct that service be effected within a specified time; provided that\n               if the plaintiff shows good cause for the failure, the court shall extend\n               the time for service for an appropriate period. This subdivision does\n               not apply to service in a foreign country pursuant to subdivision (f)\n               or (j)(1).\n\nCIT R. 4(m). Subsequent to the passage of the 1993 Amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil\n\nProcedure, most jurisdictions require that the consideration of whether to extend the time for service\n\nof process under Rule 4(m) requires a district judge to engage in what is essentially a two-part\n\ninquiry.2 First, the court must determine whether \u201cgood cause\u201d exists for an extension of time; if the\n\ncourt finds that good cause exists, it must extend time for service \u201cand the inquiry is ended.\u201d\n\nPetrucelli v. Bohringer and Ratzinger GMBH, 46 F.3d 1298, 1305 (3d Cir. 1995). Second, \u201ceven\n\nif there is no good cause shown,\u201d the court must then consider whether the circumstances of the case\n\nwarrant the grant of a discretionary extension of time. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m) and Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\nadvisory committee notes, 28 U.S.C. App., p. 654 (authorizing courts discretion to grant an extension\n\nof time \u201ceven if there is no good cause shown,\u201d noting that \u201c[r]elief may be justified, for example,\n\nif the applicable statute of limitations would bar the refiled action, or if the defendant is evading\n\nservice or conceals a defect in attempted service.\u201d); Henderson v. United States, 517 U.S. 654, 662\n\n(1996) (recognizing that the 1993 amendments to the rules accorded courts the discretion to enlarge\n\nthe 120-day service period even without a showing of good cause).\n\n       Prior to the 1993 Amendments, this Court established a standard for demonstrating \u201cgood\n\n       2\n           Prior to December 1, 1993, CIT Rule 4(m) was designated as 4(h) and the comparable\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure was 4(j). After December 1, 1993 (and the 1993 Amendments)\nthe letter designations were harmonized so that CIT Rule 4(m) and Federal Rule 4(m) are the\nsame rule.\n\fCourt No. 07-00263                                                                             Page 5\n\n\ncause\u201d pursuant to Rule 4 in United States v. Gen. Int\u2019l Mktg. Group, 14 CIT 545, 742 F.Supp. 1173\n\n(1990). In that case, Judge Watson concluded that\n\n               a fair standard of good cause is one which requires people to show\n               behavior consistent with the recognition that a 120 day deadline\n               exists. It is worth noting that the word \u201cdeadline\u201d originated in\n               prisons to describe a line or boundary, the crossing of which\n               subjected prisoners to the penalty of death. It would seem reasonable\n               therefore to require plaintiffs to make such efforts at service as are\n               consistent with a recognition that 120 days may otherwise mark the\n               death of the action.\n\n14 CIT at 548, 742 F.Supp. at 1176. In Gen. Int\u2019l, the Court found that the plaintiff failed to\n\ndemonstrate good cause because the plaintiff\u2019s efforts at service were essentially limited to simply\n\nmailing the summons and complaint to the defendant\u2019s last known address. Although Gen. Int\u2019l\n\npreceded the 1993 amendments to Rule 4, the court sees no reason to deviate from the \u201cgood cause\u201d\n\nstandard established therein to address the first part of the inquiry.\n\n       In the current matter, Customs asserts that \u201cgood cause\u201d exists for an extension of time\n\nbecause the principal attorney on the case suffered \u201ca broken arm, which required surgery upon two\n\noccasions and significant time out of the office for recovery and medical appointments.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Out\n\nof Time Mot. at 2. Customs contends that the court\u2019s standard of \u201cgood cause\u201d should include an\n\nattorney\u2019s illness, as noted in LeMaster v. City of Winnemucca, 113 F.R.D. 37 (D. Nev 1986)\n\n(finding \u201cgood cause\u201d for 17-day delay in service where plaintiff\u2019s sole attorney was being treated\n\nfor terminal cancer). Additionally, Customs notes that \u201cWCE would not have good arguments based\n\nupon the delay,\u201d because \u201cit appears that WCE attempted to evade service.\u201d Customs bases this\n\nallegation on its contention that (1) service of process was delayed by a week because WCE\u2019s\n\nregistered agent was not found at the address listed by the Texas Secretary of State; and (2) \u201cit took\n\fCourt No. 07-00263                                                                             Page 6\n\n\nthe process server numerous attempts\u201d to serve additional documents on WCE. Pl.\u2019s Resp. to\n\nHartford\u2019s Mot. in Opp. at 8.\n\n       Customs argues further that even if no good cause exists, the court should exercise its\n\ndiscretion to grant an extension of time for service. Customs urges the court to consider (1) the fact\n\nthat the running of the statute of limitations would bar refiling of the claim; (2) that WCE was served\n\n\u201cless than one month beyond the statutory deadline\u201d and would suffer no prejudice from the delay;\n\nand (3) that Hartford has suffered \u201cno prejudice whatever\u201d as a result of the delayed service to WCE.\n\nId. at 10. Finally, Customs asserts that Hartford \u201clacks standing to assert the legal rights of WCE\n\nas to the delayed service,\u201d because Hartford was timely served with the complaint. Id. at 11.\n\n       The court cannot find that good cause exists for the delay in service here. Given that\n\nCustoms agreed to accept the waiver of service within 60 days of July 16, 2007, Customs would\n\nhave been aware on September 15, 2007 that WCE refused to waive service, yet it took no further\n\naction in the matter until November 30, 2007, almost two weeks after the expiration of the 120-day\n\nservice period. Except for the initial request for waiver of service, Customs apparently made no\n\nattempt whatsoever to serve WCE within the 120-day period. Such complete inaction cannot\n\nplausibly be interpreted as \u201cbehavior consistent with the recognition that a 120-day deadline exists.\u201d\n\nFurther, even if the court were to adopt the \u201cgood cause\u201d standard from LeMaster, it is unlikely that\n\nthat standard would affect the court\u2019s decision here. In LeMaster, the only attorney serving the\n\nplaintiff underwent weekly treatments of chemotherapy and radiation to treat what eventually\n\nbecame terminal cancer. LeMaster, 113 F.R.D. at 38. In this case, the plaintiff is represented by the\n\nUnited States Department of Justice, and the individual attorney assigned to the case broke his arm\n\fCourt No. 07-00263                                                                             Page 7\n\n\non September 22, 2007. Although the court is sympathetic to counsel\u2019s injury, a broken arm cannot\n\nrealistically be compared to terminal cancer. More importantly, counsel for the plaintiff is hardly\n\na solo practitioner with limited resources: counsel is an attorney for the Department of Justice. The\n\nplaintiff has provided no reason why counsel could not have obtained assistance on this matter after\n\nhis injury, or why counsel\u2019s supervisor could not have the matter reassigned to another attorney.\n\n       Finally, although a defendant\u2019s attempt to evade service of process is generally a compelling\n\nreason to find good cause, Customs\u2019 vague allegations as to a single address change and difficulty\n\nin serving other pleadings (which, pursuant to CIT Rule 5(b), may be served by \u201c[m]ailing a copy\n\nto the last known address of the person served\u201d) cannot reasonably be viewed as evasion of service.\n\nMoreover, because the difficulties resulting from the address change or in serving other pleadings\n\ntook place well after the 120-day service period, Customs cannot realistically expect the court to find\n\nthat those occurrences were a cause of the belated service.\n\n       However \u2013 as noted above \u2013 even without a showing of good cause, the court must still\n\nconsider whether the totality of the circumstances warrant a permissive extension of time. Paneras,\n\n94 F.3d at 341. Unfortunately, other than noting that relief \u201cmay be justified\u201d in situations where\n\nthe statute of limitations has expired or where the defendant is evading service, neither the caselaw\n\nnor the Advisory Committee notes provide clear guidelines as to what other circumstances may\n\nwarrant a discretionary extension of time. Moreover, even the passage of the statute of limitations\n\nis far from a guarantee of discretionary extension, as Courts in most jurisdictions routinely dismiss\n\nactions where other factors are more compelling. See Tuke v. United States, 76 F.3d 155, 156 (7th\n\nCir. 1996) (upholding dismissal and observing that \u201can attorney who files suit when the statute of\n\fCourt No. 07-00263                                                                               Page 8\n\n\nlimitations is about to expire must take special care to achieve timely service of process, because a\n\nslip-up is fatal\u201d)3; Coleman v. Milwaukee Bd. of School Dir., 290 F.3d 932, 934 (7th Cir. 2002)\n\n(upholding dismissal where statute of limitations had run, noting that \u201cthe judge understandably was\n\ntroubled by the fact that the plaintiff had delayed till almost the last minute in attempting service.\u201d);\n\nZapata v. City of New York, 502 F.3d 192, 199 (2nd Cir. 2007) (upholding dismissal in spite of\n\npassage of the statute of limitations where plaintiff \u201cmade no effort to effect service within the\n\nservice period, neglected to ask for an extension within a reasonable period of time, and has\n\nadvanced no cognizable excuse for the delay\u201d). With no concrete factors, district judges have\n\nessentially determined each case on an individual basis while taking care not to \u201coverlook any of the\n\nfactors urged . . . by the plaintiff for exercising discretion in [its] favor.\u201d Coleman, 290 F.3d at 934.\n\n        In this case, the court is unconvinced that a discretionary extension of time is appropriate.\n\nCustoms waited until the last day of the five-year statute of limitations to file the action, but instead\n\nof \u201ctaking special care to achieve timely service of process\u201d Customs sat on its hands until two\n\nweeks after the passing of the 120-day service period. Even in cases deemed worthy of a\n\ndiscretionary extension because the plaintiff was pro se or because the method of service was\n\nunusual or complicated, the plaintiffs made some (albeit botched) attempt at service that oftentimes\n\nhad the effect of providing actual notice of the claim to the defendant. See Coleman, 290 F.3d at\n\n935-36. However, nothing indicates that such is the case here: the plaintiff is not pro se, the rules\n\n\n        3\n          The court notes that Zapata v. City of New York, 502 F.3d 192 (2nd Cir. 2007) and\nother cases support the notion that the filing of an action actually \u201ctolls\u201d the statute of limitations\nuntil service of process is completed or the 120-day period expires. Hence, a plaintiff who had\n60 days left in the statute of limitations when he filed would have that 60 days tacked onto the\nend of the 120 day period in order to refile.\n\fCourt No. 07-00263                                                                               Page 9\n\n\nof service are no more complex than any other customs case, and there is no clear indication that the\n\ndefendant had actual notice of the claim. Accordingly, the court will deny the plaintiff\u2019s out-of-time\n\nmotion and dismiss the action as to WCE. Although the court\u2019s dismissal is technically without\n\nprejudice to refiling, the expiration of the statute of limitations essentially ends the action as to WCE\n\nbecause Customs appears to be time-barred by the statute of limitations from refiling the claim.\n\n                                     II. Dismissal as to Hartford\n\n        The court must now determine whether Custom\u2019s action against Hartford must be dismissed\n\nif WCE is no longer a party to the case. Hartford argues that the court must dismiss the case against\n\nit because, without WCE as a party to the case, \u201cthe government cannot establish at court the\n\nelements proving that WCE violated 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1592(a).\u201d Def.\u2019s Reply to Pl.\u2019s Resp. to Mot. to\n\nDismiss at 10. Hartford essentially contends that the government must establish the elements of the\n\nsection 1592(a) violation in an action \u201cagainst the importer as a predicate to prosecuting a claim for\n\nduties against the surety under section 1592(d).\u201d Def.\u2019s Reply to Pl.\u2019s Resp. at 7 (emphasis added).\n\n        The court does not agree. Nothing in section 1592(d) indicates that the only manner by\n\nwhich the government may prove a violation of section 1592(a) is via successful suit against the\n\nimporter. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1592(d) provides:\n\n                (d) Deprivation of lawful duties, taxes, or fees\n\n                        Notwithstanding section 1514 of this title, if the United States\n                has been deprived of lawful duties, taxes, or fees as a result of a\n                violation of subsection (a) of this section, the Customs Service shall\n                require that such lawful duties, taxes, and fees be restored, whether\n                or not a monetary penalty is assessed.\n\n19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1592(d) (2000). Although section 1592(d) requires a \u201cviolation of subsection (a)\u201d as\n\fCourt No. 07-00263                                                                              Page 10\n\n\na prerequisite for an award pursuant to section (d), nothing in the plain language of section 1592(d)\n\nindicates that such a violation can only be established in a suit against the importer. This Court has\n\ndiscussed this concept in a number of cases involving sureties. In United States v. XL Specialty Ins.\n\nCo., the Court addressed this very issue:\n\n                Of course, such violation must be established for there to be any such\n                collection, but it does not necessarily follow that that predicate be\n                established in an action between the government and the importer.\n                That is, Blum held there to be a direct cause of action against a surety\n                for recovery of lost duties due to violation of section 1592(a), which\n                is this matter at bar. The government is not foreclosed from\n                commencing this kind of action first. To be sure, when it does so, it\n                bears the burden of proving such violation of the statute, just as it\n                does in any action brought by it against an importer pursuant to 19\n                U.S.C. \u00a7 1592.\n\n462 F.Supp.2d 1364, 1366-67 (2006) (emphasis added) (discussing United States v. Blum, 858 F.2d\n\n1566 (Fed. Cir. 1988). See also United States v. Washington Int\u2019l Ins. Co., 28 CIT__ , 374 F.Supp.\n\n2d 1265 (2005) (surety successfully defended against Customs\u2019 suit for duties by showing importer\n\nhad committed no violation under section 1592(a), even though the importer was not a party to the\n\ncase).\n\n         The only difference between XL Specialty and the current matter is that instead of bringing\n\nan action against the surety first, Customs is now maintaining an action only against the surety.\n\nHowever, the court sees no reason to bar such a lawsuit: pursuant to the concept of joint and several\n\nliability that is the mainstay of the surety-principal relationship, as well as the language of the bond,\n\nCustoms has the option to sue either party for duties. See 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 113.62 (\u201cBasic importation\n\nand entry bond conditions\u201d); Washington Int\u2019l Ins. Co. v. United States, 25 CIT 207, 225, 138\n\nF.Supp. 2d 1314, 1331 (2001) (holding that the joint and several liability stemming from the\n\fCourt No. 07-00263                                                                            Page 11\n\n\nlanguage of the bond \u201cgrants the United States the discretionary authority to seek payment from [the\n\nbond surety] independently of any action that may be brought against the principal.\u201d); Blum, 858\n\nF.2d at 1570 (holding that \u00a7 1592(d) \u201cprovides the United States with a cause of action to recover\n\nduties from those parties traditionally liable for such duties, e.g., the importer of record and its\n\nsurety.\u201d); Balboa Ins. Co. v. United States, 775 F.2d 1158, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (holding that a\n\nsurety bond \u201ccreates a three-party relationship, in which the surety becomes liable for the principal's\n\ndebt or duty to the third party obligee (here, the government).\u201d). As the United States Court of\n\nAppeals for the Federal Circuit observed:\n\n               The surety's obligation to pay does not wait for completion of legal\n               contests between the principal and the creditor. If a surety's\n               obligation to pay only arose upon conclusion of lawsuits, the creditor\n               would lose a significant part of the protection it bargained to obtain.\n\nIns. Co. of North America v. United States, 951 F.2d 1244, 1246 (Fed. Cir. 1991). Hence, the court\n\nfinds no support for Hartford\u2019s contention that Customs cannot establish a violation of section\n\n1592(a) without WCE as a party to the suit, and can see no reason why Customs inability to bring\n\nan action under section 1592(a) would otherwise preclude it from suing a surety under section\n\n1592(d), see United States v. Jac Natori Co., Ltd., 108 F.3d 295 (1997) (permitting recovery of\n\nduties under section 1592(d) even where the statute of limitations under former 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621\n\nbarred an action for recovery of penalties under section 1592(a)).\n\n       The court recognizes that Hartford may have several defenses against the current action\n\npursuant to its status as a surety and relating to whether its obligations as a surety have been\n\fCourt No. 07-00263                                                                         Page 12\n\n\ndischarged.4 However, Hartford has asserted no defenses in this regard and it is not within the\n\npurview of the court to do so on its behalf. Accordingly, the court will deny Hartford\u2019s motion to\n\ndismiss and allow the suit against Hartford to proceed. If Hartford wishes to submit a proper motion\n\nfor summary judgment to this effect, it must do so in accordance with CIT Rule 56.\n\n                                           Conclusion\n\n       Upon consideration of the foregoing, Customs\u2019 out-of-time motion for out-of-time service\n\nof process upon the defendant WCE is denied, and the matter dismissed as to WCE. Hartford\u2019s\n\nmotion to dismiss is denied.\n\n       SO ORDERED.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   /s/ R.
