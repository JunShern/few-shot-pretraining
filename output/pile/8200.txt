Also there is no terminal.\nIf you want to build apps for iOS you generally use code on a mac.\nHowever there are some apps that allow programming on the iPad but all run inside the app. Examples of this include Swift Playgrounds from Apple and various interpreters for Python, Javascript and Lua. (I have not provided links as I have not used them and my quick search found low rated or old apps) there are also interpreters that you can build on the Mac and install like Pharo ( a version of smalltalk).\n\n"
