The PR has not been reviewed|accepted.\nMeanwhile I wanted to submit a separate (non-overlapping) PR and followed instructions here to create a 2nd copy of the remote repo in my GitHub account (R\").\nI wrote the code and committed the changes to it (R\") but I'm unable to submit a PR using the GitHub UI.\n\nAm I screwed?\nOr is there a way I can add back the original origin so that I may submit the PR?\nI Googled around and tried:\ngit remote add upstream https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-builders-community.git\nBut that made no difference.\nAny guidance would be appreciated!\n\nA:\n\nYou shouldn't need to \"fork\" twice: from the local clone of your first fork, you can simply \n\ncreate another branch (from upstream/master), \nmake a second patch in that branch, \npush that second branch\nmake a second PR from said second branch on your GitHub fork.\n\n"
