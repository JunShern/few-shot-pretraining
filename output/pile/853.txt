Is this problem NP-hard? If so, how can I prove this?\n\nA:\n\nIn general, you can show that a class of problems is NP-Hard by taking a known NP-hard problem and reducing it to a problem in your class (being careful that size of the problem does not increase too much.)  \nSince some well known NP-hard problems can easily be rewritten as nonlinear optimization problems with non-convex constraints, the class of non-convex nonlinear optimization problems is in general NP-Hard.   \nHowever, this says nothing about your particular non-convex optimization problem.  \n\n"
