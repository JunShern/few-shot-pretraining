Fairfield Ludlowe was eighth with 102 points.\n\n\"It's tough to swallow, coming that close and not winning it,\" he said. \"But you have to keep it all in perspective. There were a lot of different things that happened that could have changed the outcome, but of the six wrestlers who made the finals for us, five are underclassmen.\""
