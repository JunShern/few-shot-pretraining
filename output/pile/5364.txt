As political science was able to be established in the Czech Republic only after 1989, in the mid-1990s this field of study was far from anchored in institutional, personal, or content terms. Therefore, I had the chance to write about the political consequences of the works of the Czech poet V\u00edte\u02c7zslav Nezval, whose works I found charming, and whom I also remembered as one of the prominent Czech writers who most loyally took part in building the totalitarian regime in Czechoslovakia after 1945. The thesis was supervised by Blanka R\u02c7\u00edchov\u00e1, currently head of the Department of Political Science at the Faculty of Social Sciences, Charles University.\n\nHowever, the study of Nezval's personal path and its intersection with Czechoslovak politics of the first half of the twentieth century rather than clear answers brought me in the years 1995 and 1996 a number of additional questions, this time about entire artistic movements and generations. That is why I decided to significantly expand my research territory and concentrate on the question of the mutual influence between the Czech politics of the left and the cultural and intellectual sphere. In terms of time, my research was limited on the one hand by the 1890s, when following the partial application of general suffrage in the Czech lands the first modern political parties and other political figures were established, and on the other hand by the year 1938, when after the Munich Dictate the Masaryk-era democratic First Czechoslovak Republic ceased to exist. I decided to concentrate on the intellectual and ideological grassroots of the interwar communist artistic vanguard, as it grew from communist, utopian-socialist, and Marxist and Leninist positions. Apart from this theme I also focused on the development of the coexistence of these groups with the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia between the two world wars.\n\nThe above-mentioned theme was extensively covered by Czech historiography and literary science after 1948; however, I was of the opinion that their research naturally bore an ideological mark, was exposed to (self-)censorship and also failed to utilize certain sources. Therefore, I decided to review so far unused resources (particularly communist intellectuals' own literary works), but I also turned to until then largely ignored sources\u2014interwar leftist press, which was not institutionally connected to the Communist Party, as well as some newly available archives. I spent almost two years in the archives, mainly in the National Library in Prague. I would like to express my appreciation to the librarians in the magazine section of the library for their support, and also to Martina Bene\u0161ovsk\u00e1, librarian of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, whose assistance and contacts helped me reach a number of significant sources. I was able to discuss a number of questions with my friends\u2014students of mass communication, political science, and Czech studies\u2014particularly Lubo\u0161 Brabec, Radek Dyntar, Martin Ehl, Michal Lamprecht, and Eva and Radim Proch\u00e1zka.\n\nAll the collected information was sorted mainly with the help of the consultant of my dissertation, Vladim\u00edr Novotn\u00fd, who now works at the Department of Czech Studies at the School of Education, University of West Bohemia in Pilsen. The final form of the dissertation was significantly influenced by Ivan Bernik, a sociologist and my mentor during my studies at the Faculty of Social Sciences at the University of Ljubljana/Slovenia, where I spent one year of my doctoral study. Ivan Bernik offered me the theoretical and methodological framework for organizing my research findings\u2014mainly in the form of the theory and sociology of culture\u2014and at the same time tactfully and uncompromisingly saw to it that I finished the dissertation. For this, as well as other things, he has my appreciation.\n\nI successfully defended my dissertation in 1999 and subsequently had it published in Czech. It was first published in 2000 by the Institute for Central-European Culture and Politics (ISE)\u2014my thanks mainly to the director of the publishing house, Rudolf Kuc\u02c7era\u2014and it was published for the second time in 2005 by the publishing company of Ale\u0161 C\u02c7ene\u02c7k. I am very happy that I can offer my revised edition of this text to a larger number of readers. For this I would like to thank mainly Michael Sisskin from Lexington Books and also the Department of Politics and International Relations at the Faculty of Philosophy and Arts, University of West Bohemia in Pilsen, where I have been teaching for more than ten years and which provided the necessary financial support to publish the English version of the book. Special thanks to Zuzana Krc\u02c7\u00e1lov\u00e1 and Alera Frankov\u00e1 for their help throughout the process of publication.\n\nAnd last but not least, I would like to thank my family, my wife, \u00e1rka Waisov\u00e1, and my daughter, Hanna, for their continued support and understanding. I dedicate this book to them.\n\n# Chapter 1\n\n## Introduction\n\nTheoretical Fundamentals\n\nIn terms of politics, the end of the nineteenth century and especially the beginning of the twentieth century brought revolutionary changes that significantly affected and changed the nature of political life. The gradual spread of the right to vote and the introduction of new, increasingly liberal laws meant the end of politics as the privilege of a small group of the chosen few. The coming of the masses that J. Ortega y Gasset writes about so impressively1 necessarily brought about painful conflicts, which very much changed the character of a century coming to its end. The efforts to achieve a more just world order based on economic, social, and political democracy in many places ended up in authoritarian and totalitarian regimes, which especially in Europe between the two world wars gained a very strong position.\n\nAlso in the field of culture, the turn of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries brought considerable changes. The disintegration of the so-far more or less unified view, based on the Ancient\u2013Jewish\u2013Christian tradition,2 foreshadowed in the disagreement between romanticism and realism in the first half of the nineteenth century, resulted in terms of culture in the eruption of modernism. The essentially uniform esthetic roots until that time fall apart, giving way to alternative artistic trends that often combine their artistic requirements with political views. Already before WWI, there were calls for new, modern \"world orders,\"3 which would also ensure free art production based on new esthetic ideas.\n\nAccording to D. Bell, modern cultural trends, which he calls subcultures, are a manifestation of the disintegration of the unified culture of the classic capitalist era. At the turn of the century, social relations became so complex and differentiated that it was no longer possible to speak of a culture that would reflect the entire society. Thus specialized subcultures are formed, each with its own means of expression, symbols, and so on.4 Similar ideas are displayed in the work of P. Berger, who considers private, meditative subculture to be an element which ensures the stability of private life in modern society.5 \"In connection with the term subculture, Berger uses another two terms: 'balkanization' (crumbling) and pluralism.\"6\n\nModern culture sets off the disintegration of until then leading traditionalism and academism becomes one of its alternatives. This is based on the assumption that the basic criterion of modernism is the absolute rejection of existing values, both artistic as well as political ones. The conflict between traditional culture and modern trends sharpens, which especially in the 1920s and 1930s gives rise to a wave of avant-garde trends, offering very radical solutions both in the cultural as well as political fields. According to some authors, this negative relationship toward traditional society climaxed in futurism and surrealism. \"The most strict judgment [of traditionalism] can be found in the work of Breton, who demanded that the bourgeois way of life be defamed, even by opening fire on a crowd of people; and in the work of Marinetti, who suggested the destruction of its entire cultural heritage, etc.\"7\n\nModern culture is also characterized by the fact that the lack of adaptability, oftentimes bordering on a masochistic effort not to be successful, is paradoxically considered to be a success. For example, in surrealism success is considered something undesirable.8 This form of struggle against existing conventions and norms soon transforms into the political sphere. L. Bu\u00f1uel, the only unquestionably surrealist film director, mentions in his memoirs that surrealists were attracted to the idea of revolution. \"Surrealists, who did not consider themselves to be terrorists or armed activists, fought against the society they hated, their main weapon being scandal, which for a long time they considered an all-powerful tool in the fight against social injustice, human exploitation, the stupefying influence of religion, brutal colonial militarism, revealing the secret and invisible driving forces of the system, which needed to be brought down.\"9\n\nAccording to Bu\u00f1uel, surrealists never strived to create a new literary, artistic, or philosophical movement. Their main goal was to subvert the existing society. However, because a scandal was not a sufficiently powerful means, many surrealists10 soon redirected their attention to the political sphere and \"mostly joined the communist movement, which alone bore the characteristics of a revolution.\"11\n\nTo follow up on the definition of a subculture by Bell or Berger, surrealists, or members of the avant-garde, represent a certain subculture. However, this is true only up until the moment when cultural and artistic work starts to combine with political activity. That is why both authors strictly differentiate between subculture in the true sense of the word and counterculture. \"The first one is defined in relation to the predominant culture and applies to a special space, special reality, in which the values of the general society (especially the universal ones) are abandoned; to a special world which corresponds with its primary interests and identification and which gives its members a feeling of safety, unity,12 etc.\"13 On the other hand, counterculture represents gathering because of specifically defined social and mainly political goals. \"Members of the counterculture do not avoid [the conflict], but they fight and take over 'foreign' worlds. Counterculture is a true alternative to predominant culture, an alternative in the sense of a possible replacement of existing rules with new ones. For members of the counterculture, co-existence with the predominant culture is unacceptable.\"14\n\nOf course, it is difficult to draw a line between subculture and counterculture because the goals set by the avant-garde cultural movements, as well as the means they use for their implementation, are so different and also very specific, that it is impossible to define unquestionable and unchanging criteria as for their distinction. According to Rupel, there are usually several countercultural movements,15 all with their own political ambitions. Individual avant-garde movements focus not only on subverting the existing cultural and political system, but they also compete with one another, they deny one another's avant-garde nature and try to prove their own exclusive position among modern intellectual movements, \"they often change and sooner or later refer to a right of cultural renewal and harmony with the historical (and also political) present.\"16\n\nThe combination of some cultural trends with political movements in the 1920s and 1930s resulted in the militarization of a great many intellectuals. This process is also noticeable in interwar Czechoslovakia, not only on the left of the political spectrum in artists joining the Communist Party, but also on the right side of political life, for example, in literary Catholicism.17 Political parties on both sides of the Czechoslovak political scene unscrupulously took advantage of their \"modern nature,\" which they offered to supporters of new cultural trends as a political basis for implementing their esthetic ideals. This militarization of the Czechoslovak cultural left, which can be observed as early as in WWI, is the main topic of this material.\n\nThe emerging communist movement was initially very attractive for artists and intellectuals due to its ideology of the inevitability of world revolution, which was about to bring a better world order. Members of all generations of artists supported the left, hazy socialist ideals and also Soviet Russia, which was supposed to implement these ideals in practice. While some, under the impression of the practical politics of the Communist International and the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, gradually sobered up, others became all the more zealous followers of communism in its soviet form.\n\nThus, the cultural left in Czechoslovakia moved from the subcultural to the countercultural position. This process, very much inconsistent and often disorganized, will be the subject of my description and analysis in the following text. The focus is on important events in both the cultural as well as political field. Much attention is paid to the formation of the Communist Party in Czechoslovakia. I consider this process, influenced by many ideological as well as personal disagreements between representatives of individual movements, which in the 1920s merged in the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, to be the foundation to understanding a number of events and mainly conflicts within the Communist Party, not only in the area of culture (for example, activities of former anarchists).\n\nMethodological Foundation\n\nThis text was originally written as a dissertation thesis at the Institute of Political Science and was primarily designed as a work of political science. From the theoretical introduction it is clear that the relationship between politics and culture requires a multilateral approach, based not only on politological methodology, but also on a number of other sciences.\n\nIn the first place we must mention cultural sociology, an invaluable aid in searching for theoretical, generalizing knowledge of the development of culture, its changes, and splits, and so on. Especially in the 1960s and 1970s, in connection with a wave of Muslim immigrants into Western Europe, the sociology of culture has undoubtedly developed into a very important field of study, which deals with research of the changes to culture,18 but also studies the relationships between individual cultures, their competitiveness, the replacement with one another, and also their collaboration. The basic ideas about cultural development in the twentieth century, which I described in the theoretical fundamentals part, were also presented by scientists who operated on the verge of political science, sociology, and culturology.\n\nAnother substantial field of study, virtually indispensable in the work of political science, is history. It is certainly not a coincidence that a number of Czech as well as world historians and political scientists maintain a balance between these two fields. From time to time there are objections to the excessive convergence between political science and history in the Czech academic community; I, on the other hand, consider it a plus that, considering the \"historical conditions,\" a great many Czech political scientists have come with historicizing approaches.\n\nAs the publication deals mainly with artists, in some sections one cannot avoid the approach of literary criticism. In the majority of cases, expert opinions are provided; however, the text also contains my own evaluations of some works of art, based on my personal judgment and taste. Although I do realize that one's taste in art is a highly subjective and relative thing, still I hope I have managed to achieve a maximum degree of objectivity.\n\nA large portion of the text is comprised of press analyses. As a political scientist, I am aware of the fact that the information I work with has already been processed and that it can often\u2014especially in the communist press\u2014be quite non-objective; but using such information, naturally compared with other, preferably original sources describing the same event, is crucial for my research as it enables the identification of deceitful and deliberately distorted information. My experience with the communist press urges me to use utmost caution in using information.19 The same applies to the use of sources of a private nature, such as memoirs, for example. It is not rare to encounter a situation where one and the same event is described by several people very differently. Altering reality, whether it be because of a rich imagination, artistic intentions, or for other reasons, is a characteristic trait of artists especially.\n\nWhile writing this publication I took a multidisciplinary approach that corresponds with the selected topic and flows from the possibilities that the various fields of study offer. I do believe this decision was made to the benefit of this work.\n\nNotes\n\n1. Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset, Vzpoura davu\u02da (Prague: Na\u0161e vojsko, 1993).\n\n2.

C\u02c7SDSD was part of the Austrian Social Democratic Party and thus also part of the Second International, an international formation of Marxist parties established in Paris in 1889. The Social Democratic Party's agenda was based on the principles adopted by the Austrian social democratic congress held in Hainfeld at the turn of the years 1888 and 1889. The following are the main principles adopted by the congress:\n\n\u2022 The Social Democratic Party is an international party (unity within the entire Austro-Hungarian Empire).\n\n\u2022 The party spreads socialist ideas (teachings of Karl Marx).\n\n\u2022 In spite of the party's doubts about parliamentarism, the party demands universal suffrage.\n\n\u2022 As its basic organizational units, the party forms strong and unified trade unions.\n\n\u2022 The party demands free education for everybody and separation of the church and the state.\n\n\u2022 The party demands the replacement of a permanent military by the arming of the general population.1\n\nThe Hainfeld congress can be viewed as a German-Czech congress, especially when we take into consideration the nationality of the delegates; there were ninety-seven Germans, ten Czechs, two Slovenians, and one Pole.2\n\nIn spite of the proclamations of the Hainfeld congress, the national segments within the Austrian Democratic Party started practically from the early 1890s to practice independent politics. This tendency became most noticeable following the implementation of the suffrage reforms by the prime minister, Kazim\u00edr Badeni, thanks to which a so-called general (fifth) curia was formed. Because of the reform, the social democrats could for the first time be represented in the Imperial Council. Out of seventy-two seats reserved for the fifth curia, the Social Democratic Party gained fourteen mandates\u2014in terms of nationality, there were seven Germans, five Czechs and two Poles.3 However, entry into parliamentary politics could result in\u2014and in the end actually did result in\u2014the danger of dissension. The social democratic members of parliament faced a dilemma, whether within the Imperial Council to defend international interests (and vote in unison) or national interests (and vote along with representatives of other national parties).\n\nThe tension between the supporters of the joint effort policy of all nationalities (centrists) and the supporters of the idea of more independent national politics of individual national parties was also the main item on the agenda of the sixth Austro-Hungarian Social Democratic Congress in June of 1897. The congress transformed the party into a federation of national parties: German, Czech, Polish, South Slavic, and Italian. The social democrats thus inclined to the principles of so-called austromarxism. According to these principles, social democrats \"limited the question of nationhood only to the language and culture.\"4 However, this measure did not manage to prevent the frequent involvement of social democratic members of parliament in individual national Blocs, and consequently disagreement in the entire Austro-Hungarian social democratic movement.\n\nThe final breakup of individual national social democratic segments occurs in the first decade of the twentieth century. The national disagreements mainly between the two strongest segments of the party\u2014Czech and German\u2014reach such proportions that they are no longer sustainable. Czech social democrats strive for a complete detachment of all organizations from the Austro-Hungarian structure, which causes frequent criticism on the platform of the Second International. The definitive breakup comes in connection with the declaration of independence by the Czechoslovak Trade Unions, formed in March of 1910 as the only trade union of the Czech social democrats. The August congress of the Second International held in Copenhagen in the same year condemns this step as damaging the internationalism of the social democrats,5 but the leaders of the Czechoslovak Social Democratic Workers' Party refuse to accept these objections. There is dissent within the party, when mainly certain Moravian social democratic organizations and associations insist on membership in the Trade Unions of Austria-Hungary. Following their expulsion from C\u02c7SDSD, these organizations establish an independent political party\u2014the Czech Social Democratic Party\u2014which in professional literature is often labeled as centrist.6 Centrists become part of the Austro-Hungarian Party; however, their number, compared to the Czechoslovak Social Democratic Party, is very small.\n\nLet me emphasize that the disagreements in the Social Democratic Party of Austria-Hungary were part of a more general trend, which started to become noticeable in the socialist movement and the Second International at the turn of the century. The movement starts to split and there arise at least three streams that take on an independent direction.\n\n1. Reformists, a stream striving for a revision of the Marxist revolutionary program, gradually modified until the idea of a revolution was abandoned. Among its representatives were, for example, E. Bernstein in Germany and F. Modr\u00e1c\u02c7ek in Bohemia. We can find reformists in an institutionalized form in the Russian Menshevik Party, and in Bohemia in the form of the Czechoslovak Social Democratic Workers' Party, established in 1919 (see chapter 3).\n\n2. Centrists, a stream holding Marxist positions, but its practical steps are starting to divert from the Hainfeld program. Centrists formed the strongest segment of the international working-class movement.\n\n3. The Left, which starts to emerge only gradually and until the end of WWI, appears in an institutionalized form only in the Bolshevik Party in Russia. The prominent representative of this stream was V.I. Uljanov-Lenin, who strived for the development of K. Marx's theories and their modification to specific historical and political conditions. The German social democrats K. Liebknecht and R. Luxemburg also leaned toward the Left. The authors of Pr\u02c7ehled de\u02c7jin Komunistick\u00e9 strany C\u02c7eskoslovenska attribute an affiliation to the social democratic Left also to the main figure of prewar C\u02c7SDSD and the first chairman of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, Bohum\u00edr meral.7 However, this statement, considering meral's practical politics before as well as during WWI, cannot be taken seriously and it needs to be attributed to the time of the book's publication and also political interests. In spite of their disagreements, practically all of the movements' segments remain within the Second International.\n\nFollowing the introduction of general suffrage (for men) during the Imperial Council election in 1905 (first applied in 1907), the Czechoslovak social democrats become the strongest Czech political party. Social democrats gained 37 percent of votes cast in Bohemia, but thanks to the electoral distribution, only 22 percent of the mandates. Thus, having won twenty-four mandates, they found themselves behind the Agrarian Party (twenty-eight mandates) and the National Liberal Party (twenty-six mandates). Only electoral reform and the connected spread of the right to vote enabled the Social Democratic Party to use to the fullest the potential of its organization's basic component, the workers' trade unions. However, the party is incapable of confirming this trend in the following election and loses five seats. The probable cause is steering away from revolutionary rhetoric and the leaning of practical politics under meral's leadership toward centrist positions. As early as in 1909, meral announces the party's demands, moving away from the Marxist idea of revolutionary change. meral declares two basic ideas:\n\n1. Complete national autonomy for each of Austria's nationalities, based on the principle of personality in the national and cultural sense of the word.\n\n2. Democratization, self-governance, and decentralization of the state administration and state institutions in all other aspects.8\n\nAccording to meral, all nations of the monarchy should gain by the change (evolutionary rather than revolutionary) their own parliament and government for the matters of language and culture; all other matters would remain in the authority of the common institutions of Austria-Hungary.\n\nApart from abandoning the idea of revolution, shortly before the outbreak of WWI, C\u02c7SDSD also begins to turn away, as do other national social democratic parties in Austria-Hungary, from its internationalism. At the party's last prewar congress (eleventh congress in December of 1913 in \u017dof\u00edn, Prague), social democrats support the need to maintain Austria-Hungary as a common state in its existing geographical boundaries: \"The Czechoslovak Social Democratic Workers' Party considers this state to be the historical foundation of its activities and all other ideas . . . , commonly labeled with terms such as Pan-Germanism and political Pan-Slavism, are considered to be contradictory to the interests of the Czech workers.\"9\n\nThe general crisis of the social movement, which in the end culminated in the agreement of the national social democratic parties to war loans and dissension within the Second International, also affected the Czechoslovak social democrats. meral's leadership not only failed to stop the nationalization of the party, which only resulted in damage (see the previously mentioned results of the Imperial Council election in 1911), but meral himself became a staunch promoter of national (meaning Austrian) politics. In meral's defense, it needs to be noted that before 1914, there was not a strong enough opposition that would point out the disadvantages of turning away from internationalism. Even meral's future great ideological opponent, F. Modr\u00e1c\u02c7ek, assumes a clearly pro-Austrian position in 1913, when declaring the following at the party's congress: \"We Czechs, who suffered so much in this state, are a nation which has nowhere to run away to. . . . We exist in this state and we cannot rely on anyone.\"10 Entry into practical parliamentary politics and also the threat of German chauvinism placed the party in a difficult situation it was not capable of coping with quickly (for more details, refer to the next chapter).\n\nThe Anarchist Movement\n\nIf we look for the combination of culture and leftism in the prewar era, we find it in the Czech anarchist movement. As early as in the 1890s, probably the most expressive and persistent promoter of the narrow relationship between left-oriented politics and culture, Stanislav Kostka Neumann, identifies with the ideas of anarchism. At the turn of the century, part of the young intelligentsia gathers around his magazines Nov\u00fd Kult and Z\u00e1druha, after previously being associated with the so-called modest socialist clubs\u2014these were clubs that followed in the tracks of the Hnut\u00ed Omladiny (Youth Movement), which was closed down in 1899. For Neumann at this time, the combination of anarchism and culture was more ideological than a thing of practical politics. \"Neumann considered anarchism mostly an ideological program rather than a political movement. The ideas of individualism and countering authority, belief in absolute freedom and the right to one's own ethical code corresponded with Neumann's art creed and ideas. . . . In this spirit, S.K. Neumann also founded the Nov\u00fd Kult magazine with the motto outside and above everything and everyone.\"11\n\nThe group around Neumann, formed in Prague, was convinced of the special role of education and campaigning, which it also took up. These opinions can be found in Neumann's work following his association with communism. On these he even founded his activities in the cultural organizations connected to the Communist Party. Among the supporters of the Czech anarchist movement were Fr\u00e1n\u02c7a r\u00e1mek, Jir\u02c7\u00ed Mahen, Karel Toman, Franti\u0161ek Gellner, Franti\u0161ek Kupka and others. However, the group was quite small in size. According to J. Tu\u02dama, the Prague group represented a special case in the anarchist movement. \"(In Prague) also small groups of petit bourgeoisie and radical artistic intelligentsia professed anarchism. Prague was the ideological center of the anarchist movement, while the north and the north-east of Bohemia represented its grassroots.\"12\n\nTu\u02dama's mention of North Bohemia and the grassroots of the anarchist movement refers to the formation of independent anarchist trade unions in connection with the coal miners' strike in 1900. At the Duchcov conference held on September 2, 1900, these originally spontaneously formed clubs agree on the idea of establishing a separate trade union, independent of political parties. Anarchist unions, joined in a federation, represented several industries, mainly the mining, textile, and glassworking industries.\n\nIn this very liberal movement without any formal organization, both main groups, the Prague group and the North-Bohemian one,13 soon got into disagreement. In February of 1903, a dispute erupts at the Czech anarchists' congress in Most between the representative of the trade unions, K. Vohryzek, and the theoretical group led by S. K. Neumann. The root of the dispute was the role of trade unions in the anarchist movement. According to Neumann, trade unions are one of the means of influencing workers en masse, but not the only one, and it is not possible to keep them in a neutral position; instead, they should have a truly anarchist character, that is, they should be transformed into political unions. Neumann also criticized the underrating of theoretical work and campaigning. On the other hand, his opponents considered trade unions \"merely\" an intermediary during negotiations on improving working conditions for their members. The congress finally concluded with a compromise. \"The proposal that the anarchists establish free groups focusing on education and campaigning was accepted; however, the congress results also fully endorsed the neutral orientation of trade unionism supporters.\"14\n\nIn 1904, both anarchist groups attempted to establish their own coordinating body. On November 27, the Czech Federation of All Trade Unions (hereinafter referred to as C\u02c7FVO) is founded; around Christmas 1904, twenty-two anarchist groups are united in the Czech Anarchist Federation (hereinafter referred to as C\u02c7AF). However, the membership of both federations was very small. According to some sources, C\u02c7FVO consisted of approximately a thousand members.15 Although both organizations closely collaborated with each other, their job content was completely different. While trade unionists \"emphasized the orientation towards economic struggle . . . , the Prague groups pressed the theoretical aspect of the anarchist movement and put first educational, promotional and agitation activities.\"16 In 1905, Neumann even attempted to publish a magazine called The Anarchist Revue; however, it had to be closed down in 1906 due to low readership numbers and a subsequent lack of resources to continue. At this time, most of Neumann's supporters from the same generation leave him.17\n\nDisputes between the two main streams of the anarchist movement also continue in the following years. At the third congress of the Czech anarchists, R. Te\u02c7snohl\u00eddek comes with strong criticism of the C\u02c7FVO. He speaks \"against the idea of developing federalized trade unions, which, based on the principle of complete neutrality, would accept all workers regardless of their political opinions or nationality. . . . He also warns against overrating the importance of membership size and appeals to the tradition of anarchist groups which consisted only of class-conscious and informed members.\"18 On the one hand, in Te\u02c7snohl\u00eddek's speech we encounter signs of nationalism, which is in contradiction with the ideas of European anarchism, but also with an idea that is very significant for the following chapters. It is the idea of certain elitism, based on education and an understanding of the basic theoretical postulates of the revolutionary movement (in this case, an anarchist one). Similar opinions are presented by anarchists who after the war join the communist movement.\n\nIn the summer of 1907, a European anarchist congress was held in Amsterdam, at which \"the domination of the collectivist orientation as well as the purposefulness of legal forms of organization was confirmed. . . . The delegates [from Bohemia, K. Vohryzek and L. Knotek] were recommended to organize mass antimilitarist struggles and set up antimilitarist sections.\"19 Based on the conclusions of the congress and in connection with the first antimilitarist congress of the national socialist youth in 1908, especially the young anarchist generation becomes more closely acquainted with some of the representatives of the socialist youth (E. patn\u00fd, A. Hatina, J. Trnobransk\u00fd). This combination has its importance with a view to future developments in the anarchist movement as well as inside the National Socialist Party.\n\nAt approximately the same time, the young generation of anarchists, represented mainly by B. Vrbensk\u00fd, starts to oppose Vohryzek's leadership of C\u02c7FVO and considers a transformation of the movement into a political party. This effort reaches a more specific form at the C\u02c7AF congress in April of 1914, where the Federation of Czech Anarcho-Communists is founded, including both representatives of C\u02c7AF and C\u02c7FVO (the group around Vrbensk\u00fd). Due to the outbreak of WWI and subsequent persecution by the Austrian authorities, the federation never launched its activities.\n\nAnarchists did not play an important role on the Czech political scene, partially because of their small number, and also because of their refusal of the standard means of struggle for political power. It is not just about not wanting to take part in the elections, but also about rejecting the usual and purposeful forms of political organization. Thanks to these positions, anarchists did not succeed in uniting themselves in a political party which would represent the movement.20 With regard to the topic of this book, it is particularly the Czech Anarchist Federation organized by Neumann, which, in spite of its low membership, was especially significant, providing an umbrella for independent groups of theoreticians of culture and art, promoters of campaigning and education as the main means of winning the proletariat over.\n\nNational Socialists\n\nThe modernization of suffrage, connected with the suffrage reforms initiated by K. Badeni's government, previously mentioned in this chapter, also required the modernization of the inner works of political parties and the related modernization of the party system in the Czech lands. This causal relationship is most noticeable in the National Liberal Party, which, prior to the establishment of the fifth curia, was the dominant Czech political party. This monolith comprised supporters of various political orientations, who began to split from the party following the spread of suffrage rights. The very first party formed by way of secession from the National Liberal Party were the so-called national workers.\n\nThe foundation of this formation is directly linked to the entry of the Czechoslovak Social Democrats to the Imperial Council. Social democrats introduced their activity in the parliament's lower chamber by an \"anti-sovereignty\" proclamation, which was a reaction to the traditional demand for sovereignty by the Czech deputies upon entry to the Imperial Council. In their speech in March 1897, the social democrats condemned the sovereignty proclamation as digging for rusty historical privileges and documents.21 In an immediate reaction from part of the \"bourgeois members of parliament,\" a political organization was established, which was to offer a similar program to that of the social democrats, and on top of that, it would also be a national organization. Already on April 4, 1897, a constitutive meeting of the so-called national workers is held at the Old Town Hall in Prague. The meeting was inspired by the N\u00e1rodn\u00ed listy (the National Paper) editor, V\u00e1clav Jaroslav Klof\u00e1c\u02c7.22 A preparatory committee of a new political party was formed, led by F. Kv\u00e1c\u02c7a and A. Simonides. The newly established political party was called the National Workers' Party.\n\nIn April of the following year (April 9\u201311, 1898), the constitutive congress of the National Socialist Party in Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia, and Lower and Upper Austria was held. At the congress, the first official political program was passed for a party, which finally rid itself of the label of the left faction of the National Liberal Party and set out on an independent journey. National socialists demanded the declaration of a Czech state based on broad democracy. \"The Czech national workers' movement is based on today's political, economic and social evils. Under political evil we understand bureaucratic centralism, the inadequate dominance of Germans and the exclusion of the wide masses from the administration of public affairs.\"23 National socialists demand the introduction of general suffrage, the right to self-determination of the Czech nation and religious freedom. One of the pillars of their program is also strong antimilitarism. On the other hand, they resolutely reject the internationalism of the social democrats as well as the Marxist teachings on revolution and the necessity to change ownership relations by force. Thus, the first non-Marxist left-wing party emerges in Bohemia, demanding democratization changes by way of reform instead of revolution. Unlike the social democrats, the national socialists profess the untouchability of private ownership and are also much more nationalistic.\n\nIn comparison with the social democrats, the national socialists had very weak trade unions (Czech Workers' Community), which was also a consequence of their \"burghers' grassroots.\" The initially declared orientation toward blue collar voters was later expanded to small producers and tradesmen. The National Socialist Youth, established in 1901, gained a strong position within the party and took radical antimilitarist and anti-Austrian positions, which brought it into a parliamentary conflict with the state authority. Following the antimilitarist congress in 1908, the authorities struck against the National Socialist Youth, arresting the entire central committee of the organization and a number of supporters of the party. In the political trial that commenced on June 30, 1909, a total of forty-six people were sentenced for seditious activities.24\n\nAlready in the first election it had taken part in (Imperial Council election in January of 1901), the National Socialist Party achieved relative success by gaining four seats in the Imperial Council. Following the introduction of general suffrage, before the election in 1907, the party unites with the Radical State Rights Progressive Party and by winning nine seats becomes the fourth most powerful Czech political party. Finally, in the last Imperial Council election, the national socialists collaborate with the National Liberal Party, which secures them an increase in the number of parliamentary seats to fourteen.\n\nAccording to the election results, it is clear that the national socialists, during their short existence, managed to constantly strengthen their position on the Czech political scene. V. J. Klof\u00e1c\u02c7, who played the role of ideological leader of the party\u2014although he was not the party's chairman\u2014even had the ambition to become an integrative figure in the consolidation of a group of Czech burgher parties (more details on these aspirations will be provided in the next chapter). In spite of their relatively radical views, the national socialists were closer to the so-called burgher parties in the prewar era than to the social democrats, who they considered to be nonnational. To put it in simple terms, we could say that national orientation was more significant for them than socialist ideology.\n\nNotes\n\n1.

Following the closing of the Imperial Council and the provincial assemblies on July 25, 19141 and the suspension of a number of civil rights (for example, the freedom of speech and assembly), within a short period of time political life was completely paralyzed. Censorship immediately focused its attention on the press of political parties. The parties' activities were also undermined by the total disruption of the membership base, which was the result of war mobilization and the drafting of the majority of active members to the front.2 It is thus understandable that most political parties concentrated only on maintaining their existence, all the more because the military regime used the tightened conditions of political life as a pretext for doing away with the actual, but also the alleged enemies of the regime.\n\n\"Already in the first days and weeks of WWI, several dozens of newspapers and magazines were closed down and a number of people, together with V\u00e1clav Klof\u00e1c\u02c7, leader of the National Socialist Party, as well as other opponents of Austrian militarism, were preventatively arrested.\"3 Gradually, representatives of various political movements found themselves in prison, from the anarchist communist Vrbensk\u00fd to the nationalists Machar and Dyk. In May of 1915, in connection with measures against the rising pro-Russian or pan-Slavic tendencies among the inhabitants of the Czech lands, Karel Kram\u00e1r\u02c7 and the Sokol president, Josef Scheiner, were also arrested. While Scheiner was released after a few weeks, Kram\u00e1r\u02c7, together with another prominent representative of the National Liberal Party, Alois Ra\u0161\u00edn, was sentenced to death for treason and espionage. Although the sentence was never carried out, not only the Young Czech Party, but also other political formations were so affected by the intervention by the authorities that until the amnesty or release (e.g., Klof\u00e1c\u02c7 was never sentenced) of their leaders, they were incapable of any major resistance.\n\nAbroad, T. G. Masaryk, a representative of the Czech People's Party, gathers around himself a group of people seeking support for his idea of an independent Czechoslovakia. \"Masaryk left the country with the trust of some members of his own party and several members of other bourgeois parties [mainly the marginal State Rights Progressive Party]; however, without the formal mandate from the main political parties of the Czech bourgeoisie.\"4 Masaryk's appeals to the Agrarian and the Young Czech parties to send their representatives into exile were left without a response. Therefore, Masaryk had to rely on a narrow circle of his colleagues\u2014the former social-democratic correspondent Edvard Bene\u0161, the Slovak Milan Rastislav tef\u00e1nik, serving in France at the time, and the Russophile member of parliament for the Agrarian Party, Josef D\u00fcrich\u2014with whom he formed in 1916 the Czechoslovak National Council, of which he became chairman.\n\nOn the domestic political scene, with the absence of the leaders of the burgher parties, another team of politicians is orchestrating a joint political effort. \"Under the patronage of the doyen of Czech politicians, Karel Mattu\u0161, of the Old Czech Party, with the active participation of the leader of the Agrarian Party, Anton\u00edn vehla, and leaders of the Young Czech Party activists, Franti\u0161ek Fiedler and Zdene\u02c7k Tobolka, and with the knowledge of the social democratic leadership, negotiations were under way for several months about . . . forming the National Partnership.\"5 These negotiations led to the establishment of the National Party, uniting the National Liberal Party, the Old Czech Party, the national socialists, and the Progressive Party. With the leading figures missing, the individual segments were unable to agree on a political agenda. With the departure of the national socialists and realists (the Progressive Party), the National Party ceases to exist before it began its real political activity.\n\nAt least a partial agreement was reached by representatives of the domestic political parties on November 19, 1916. Nine Czech and Moravian parties6 agreed to set up two organizations which were to coordinate Czech politics. The first was the Czech Union, consisting of members of the Imperial Council, the second being the Czech National Committee. The Czech Union, chaired by F. Stane\u02c7k of the Agrarian Party, was not joined on the one hand by the pro-Austrian centrists, who from the beginning of the war acted in line with the pan-Austrian leadership of the social democrats, or on the other hand by the state rights party members and realists, who supported the exile efforts of T. G. Masaryk. In January of 1917, the Czech Union confirmed its pro-Austrian loyalty when, based on the initiative of the minister of foreign affairs, it told the U.S. President, W. Wilson, that it refused to accept the diplomatic note sent by the countries of the Alliance, which, among other war objectives, included the liberation of the Czech people from foreign domination. \"Actions of the Czech Union, in which pro-Austrian activism culminated during WWI, were conducted with the knowledge and consent of the National Committee in Prague.\"7 The National Committee, headed by Karel Mattu\u0161, managing director of the Zemsk\u00e1 banka (Provincial Bank), was according to its founders supposed to coordinate a joint effort of the Czech political parties in all matters national. The pro-Austrian character of its activities encountered resistance from the general public and the National Committee in fact ceased to exist in 1917. However, this was preceded by events which significantly changed not only the Czech, but also the entire Austrian political scene.\n\nThe Czech Left in the Years 1914\u20131917\n\nConvergence between the National Socialists and Anarchists\n\nNaturally, the Czech left-wing parties were not spared the persecution by the Austrian authorities either. The first blow, as was mentioned in the previous chapter, was directed against the National Socialist Party. Already on September 2, 1914, the party press was closed down, two days later came the arrest of V. J. Klof\u00e1c\u02c7, followed by other representatives of the party, who were sent to prison or detention camps. Thanks to the until then unprecedented persecution, within a few months the party ceased to exist, not only in terms of its membership base\u2014which to various degrees was the case of other Czech parties as well\u2014but also on the leadership level. \"Until 1917, there can be no mention of the existence of this wrecked and scattered party. Imprisoned leaders, dispersed organization, halted press, men on the front lines or behind them, on the other side.\"8 At the beginning of the war, the party's continuity was maintained mainly by the younger generation, in which a young editor of C\u02c7esk\u00e1 demokracie (the Czech Democracy) magazine, Jir\u02c7\u00ed Str\u02c7\u00edbrn\u00fd, stood out. Young national socialists, who were critical of the neutral politics of the Czechoslovak Social Democratic Party, found a common ground with the anarchist communists, especially with the representatives of anarcho-syndicalism.\n\nAnarcho-syndicalists rejected the introduction of any ideology into trade unionism (neutral trade unions) and in their activities they focused exclusively on gaining advantages for members of the trade unions, regardless of their political affiliation.9 Relations between young national socialists and anarchist are formed primarily based on unofficial contacts, often established in prison. For example, E. patn\u00fd, A. Hatina, and J. Trnobransk\u00fd met B. Vrbensk\u00fd, M. K\u00e1cha, C\u02c7. K\u00f6rber, and T. Barto\u0161ek at the G\u00f6lersdorf detention camp in Lower Austria.10\n\nYoung national socialists and anarchists also try to establish contact with opposition groups, which gradually spring up in the Social Democratic Party. This topic is elaborated on in more detail in the section dedicated to the attempt to form a unified Czech Socialist Party.\n\nThe Czechoslovak Social Democratic Party in the Years 1914\u20131917\n\nFor the social democratic movement, the outbreak of WWI brought dissension and a virtual collapse of the united leadership represented by the Second International. Not even after the assassination of Franti\u0161ek Ferdinand, heir to the throne, did the representatives of the International's centrist leadership (Victor Adler, Karl Kautsky, and others) foresee the possibility of a war conflict.11 In spite of their declared antimilitarism, social democrats did not oppose the mobilization and supported the governments of individual national states. The social democrats in Austria were no exception. At the meeting called after the mobilization on July 28, 1914, the German delegates expressed their agreement with the war, while the Polish delegates demanded the declaration of war not only on Serbia, but also on Russia.12 The Czech delegation, consisting of B. meral, V. Tusar, F. Tom\u00e1\u0161ek, and G. Habrman, did not take a clear pro-war position either. At the end of August 1914, a meeting of the International Socialist Bureau was held in Brussels (with C\u02c7SDSD represented by A. Ne\u02c7mec), which only confirmed the fact that the international socialist democratic movement had fallen apart. Leaders of individual national parties stated that they were incapable of effectively and jointly opposing the war. This position, supported also by specific pro-war steps taken by individual national parties,13 meant in fact the end of the Second International.\n\nFollowing the congress in Brussels comes the definitive end of the united Austrian social democracy, which results in the collapse of meral's concept of Austria's federalization. Feelings of smallness and despair befall meral. \"Like by a strike of lightning, we faced events of immense measures.\"14 In his opinion, the most suitable and also the safest way out for Czechoslovak social democracy is to reduce the party's activities to a minimum both in terms of political as well as economic struggles, and focus only on social and charitable efforts and maintaining the party's continuity at the leadership level. An order was issued to stop the activities of local organizations.15 Practically until 1916, no major opposition in social democracy stood against this position, which can only be described as opportunistic.\n\nThe war and the resulting interventions of the authoritarian military regime in the political parties' activities16 put social democracy in a new situation. By losing its support of the international movement, the party sought room and also ties for itself on the Czech political scene. From the beginning of the war, Czech social democrats establish contact with politicians of other Czech political parties. As I have mentioned before, the party's representatives enter the National Committee, a panel of united Czech politics, with meral (together with Z. Tobolka of the Young Czech Party and A. vehla of the Agrarian Party) becoming a member of the leading threesome and a vice-chairman of the Czech Union in the Imperial Council. Social democracy becomes a partner respected by other Czech political parties, as confirmed by the negotiations on the form of the state rights declaration by Czech members of parliament upon entering the Imperial Council in 1917. In spite of the ideological shift which took place during the war, social democrats maintained the natural-law concept of the Czech nation's position within the monarchy, as opposed to the historical-law concept advocated by the other political parties. The negotiations resulted in the social democratic deputies joining the compromise text of the declaration, that is, the first factual and tangible proof of possible collaboration with other political parties.\n\nRecovery of Political Life\n\nCzech Politics in the Years 1917\u20131918\n\nIn connection with the February Revolution in Russia, the Austrian government decided to call a meeting of the Imperial Council. Czech public opinion stepped up its pressure on the political representation. This process culminated in an open letter to the Czech delegates at the Imperial Council, the so-called writers' manifesto of May 17, 1917, whose text was written by a poet, Jaroslav Kvapil. More than two hundred Czech artists and scientists openly called upon Czech politicians to advocate Czech interests at the Imperial Council. \"Fulfill your sacred duty and defend Czech rights and Czech demands at this historic juncture, as your decisions will affect the destiny of the Czech people for centuries to come,\"17 as stated in the Manifesto.\n\nAt that time, negotiations were under way in the Czech Union on a joint action at the Imperial Council. The problem was wording the state rights protest so that it could be supported even by social democrats. The result was a compromise, which at the first renewed Imperial Council meeting was read out by the chairman of the Czech Union, F. Stane\u02c7k. Czech members of parliament expressed in it their conviction that the existing dualistic state created a governing and a suppressed nation and in order to do away with this national injustice, the monarchy needs to be transformed into a federal state of independent and self-governing national states.18 This compromise of a statement can be understood as a renouncement of the exile political efforts of T. G. Masaryk, as it considers reforms within the monarchy, but not the establishment of an independent state.\n\nThe second half of 1917 began with the release of the imprisoned leaders of the Czech bourgeois parties. In October, Kram\u00e1r\u02c7 and Ra\u0161\u00edn resume their leading positions in the Young Czech Party and initiate negotiations with other bourgeois parties on a merger. Similar efforts are also made by V. J. Klof\u00e1c\u02c7; however, he soon admits that at the time of the internment of the Bloc of Bourgeois Parties, the National Socialist Party has already moved away too far. Negotiations on the integration of Czech bourgeois parties was finally concluded on February 9, 1918, with the merger of the National Liberal Party, the State Rights Progressive Party, the Progressive and Moravian People's Progressive Party and the formation of the Czech State Rights Democracy. In March, the united right-wing conservative party is also joined by the Old Czech Party.\n\nAt the beginning of 1918, the Czech political parties held a general congress of the Imperial Council members at the Municipal House in Prague. At the congress, members of the Imperial Council signed the so-called Three Kings Declaration, in which they advocated the idea of a nation's self-determination. Among other things, the declaration says:\n\nBitterly, we lament that our nation was stripped of its independence as well as its right to self-determination by artificial electoral regulations, subjected to the German minority and the German centralist bureaucracy. Our Slovak branch has become a victim of the Hungarian brutality. . . . We, deputies of the Czech nation, hereby declare that peace, which would not bring our nation justice and freedom, could not represent true peace for us, but the mere beginning of a new, massive and consistent struggle for the country's independence, in which the nation would exert all of its strength, material and moral, and would not cease until it achieved a happy ending.19\n\nWith this declaration, the Czech politics finally officially espoused Masaryk's exile activities.\n\nIn July of 1918, Masaryk initiated the reorganization of the National Committee, which was to launch preparations for the takeover of power in the state. \"This step was taken following great hesitation, only when the Czechoslovak National Council was recognized by the French government as the Czechoslovak interim government on July 29.\"20 Unlike in its previous structure, the National Committee consisted of real personalities of Czech political life. The position of chairman was held by Karel Kram\u00e1r\u02c7, its vice-chairmen were the agrarian Anton\u00edn vehla and the socialist V\u00e1clav Klof\u00e1c\u02c7. Franti\u0161ek Soukup, a representative of the social democrats, the remaining relevant political party in Bohemia, was appointed Secretary of the National Committee. In its individual work streams (e.g., constitutional, economic, etc.), the National Committee took steps to ensure a peaceful takeover of power.\n\nAttempts at Integrating the Left-Wing Side of the Political Spectrum\n\nDemocratization of the political conditions in Austria in the first half of 1917 also stirred up the left-wing part of the Czech political spectrum. As early as in 1916, opposition is formed in the Social Democratic Party against the opportunist leadership of B. meral. The first movement, represented mainly by G. Habrman and L. Pik, can be considered nationalistic. Its supporters' goal was to remove meral from the party's leadership and bring the party closer to the bloc of Czech national radicalism. With this position, part of the Social Democratic Party drew closer to the national socialists. Another opposition movement within social democracy started to form around F. Modr\u00e1c\u02c7ek, who gradually steered away from the basic axioms of Marxist teachings.\n\nIn the first half of 1917, the national socialists also resume their activities. Following his return from prison, on May 28, V. Klof\u00e1c\u02c7 takes up the role of party leader. At the end of June 1917, there appears a magazine called Czech Democracy,21 a platform mainly for young national socialists to publish. The magazine also provides room for opposition groups of the social democrats, who did not get a chance to publish their work in their own party press. It is on the platform of Czech Democracy where the first contact is established between national socialists and social democrats, who work toward a common program. The social democratic opposition also forms ties with the anarchists\u2014contact between F. Modr\u00e1c\u02c7ek and J. tych is mentioned, for example, by J. Tu\u02dama.22 In the summer of 1917, it seems that the foundation of a future united left-wing party is starting to be formed; a party which should constitute a counterweight to the united bourgeois or Agrarian Party.\n\nThe events in the social democratic movement are strongly affected by the congress of the Second International in Stockholm in June of 1917, which tries to find possible solutions to the war conflict. The congress itself did not bring any breakthrough to the war's development or the socialist movement; besides, a number of streams and national parties did not even attend the congress. However, from the Czech point of view, it played an important role. \"In Stockholm, representatives of the social democratic party\u2014Ne\u02c7mec, Habrman and meral\u2014personally met Professor Maxa, a representative of Masaryk's foreign resistance. Unlike the previous, mainly informative contacts between the exiled resistance movement and the home country, this was the first time that extensive and long-lasting political negotiations had taken place. While both Ne\u02c7mec and Habrman clearly supported the position of the foreign resistance, meral insisted on his skeptical position regarding Czechoslovak independence.\"23 Let it be said that the conference was also attended by Masaryk's social democratic supporters operating outside of Austria, Karel Pergler for example, on behalf of the Czech branch of the Socialist Party of America.\n\nThe Stockholm conference of the Second International and the participation of the Czech delegation further deepened disagreements within the social democratic movement. Pressure from the intraparty opposition on meral culminated in September of 1917 with his forced resignation. He was replaced in his position of the social democratic parliamentary club's chairman by G. Habrman, in the Czech Union by V. Klof\u00e1c\u02c7, and in his position of chief editor of the Pr\u00e1vo lidu (The Right of the People) paper by J. Stiv\u00edn. The pro-Masaryk group around G. Habrman, R. Bechyne\u02c7, F. Soukup, J. Stiv\u00edn, V. Tusar, and others takes over the lead of the Social Democratic Party.\n\nHowever, not even with meral's resignation did social democracy manage to rid itself of the inner split. Already in August of 1917, the group around F. Modr\u00e1c\u02c7ek proclaimed themselves to be the radical socialist opposition and came up with a non-Marxist program. Modr\u00e1c\u02c7ek rejected one of the basic principles of Marxism\u2014state socialism established by the confiscation of means of production. He proposed the establishment of a cooperative system instead. According to Modr\u00e1c\u02c7ek, concentrating economic power in state hands is unsuitable, for in connection with political and legal power it would create a threat to the freedom of individuals and lead to the excessive growth of administration. Modr\u00e1c\u02c7ek also started publishing his own magazines by the name of Socialistick\u00e9 listy (the Socialist Paper). The new leadership of social democracy deemed Modr\u00e1c\u02c7ek's views unacceptable; however, no steps were taken. Modr\u00e1c\u02c7ek's opinions were adopted by a group around Czech Democracy (J. Str\u02c7\u00edbrn\u00fd, E. Franke), which temporarily took over control of the National Socialist Party during Klof\u00e1c\u02c7's attempt to integrate a united bourgeois party. Klof\u00e1c\u02c7, not realizing the party's transformation resulting from the influence of the young generation, thought that national socialists could be the basic building block around which a strong bourgeois party could be built under his leadership. Therefore, on August 19, 1917, he invited the representatives of most bourgeois parties to Luhac\u02c7ovice. However, the conference did not turn out to be a success, as mainly delegates from the National Liberal Party and the Moravian People's Party saw the integrating figure not in Klof\u00e1c\u02c7, but in K. Kram\u00e1r\u02c7.\n\nI have already emphasized the role of Maffia's representatives during the formation of the Czech Democracy magazine. The main goal for Masaryk's supporters was to create a strong party, whose leadership Masaryk could take over upon his return. This party was to integrate the national socialists, social democrats (excluding meral), the Progressive Party, and with a certain degree of caution also the anarchists. It was Modr\u00e1c\u02c7ek's previously mentioned program of cooperative socialism, with which the majority of national socialists identified themselves, that formed the foundations on which the integration could be built.\n\nIn mid-November of 1917, the radical social democratic opposition did come with a demand for a merger with the National Socialist Party. However, V. Klof\u00e1c\u02c7 at this time still kept ties mainly with bourgeois parties. National socialists concentrated around Czech Democracy at the time started accusing the leadership of the Czechoslovak social democracy of not being sufficiently Czech, but \"subjected to German and Jewish influences from Vienna and Berlin.\"24 It is no wonder that following such proclamations, not even the strongest nationalists in social democracy could support national socialists. Yet negotiations were still in progress, officially marked as private\u2014attended by Bechyne\u02c7, Habrman, Klof\u00e1c\u02c7, and Str\u02c7\u00edbrn\u00fd. Following their return from prison at Christmas of 1917, a representative of the anarchist syndicalism, B. Vrbensk\u00fd, also joined the negotiations. From January of 1918, Vrbensk\u00fd cooperated with Modr\u00e1c\u02c7ek in the Socialist Paper. At their conference held in Duchcov on February 3, 1918, the Federation of Czech Anarcho-Communists agreed to the merger with the National Socialist Party. The delegates commissioned to lead the negotiations were J. Kov\u00e1r\u02c7, M. K\u00e1cha, J. tych, L. tychov\u00e1, and B. Vrbensk\u00fd.25\n\nOn the same day, the nationalist group, represented by Habrman and Bechyne\u02c7, was booed at the meeting of C\u02c7SDSD provincial committees in Prague, while B. meral found himself in the limelight. meral, having left the leading positions in social democracy, leaned toward the left of the international socialist movement, represented mainly by the Bolshevik Party in Russia. Following the October (November) Revolution, in which the Bolsheviks took over the government, meral somewhat paradoxically became leader of the emerging Left stream within social democracy. He \"proceeded in close contact with the left wing of the Austrian social democratic party, which had close ties with the leftist Spartacus movement in Germany. The objective of this stream was the Bolshevik revolution in both countries of power.\"26 meral considered the formation of an independent Czech (Czechoslovak) state useless, considering the international and \"supranational\" character of the Bolshevik movement. These views were clearly in direct contradiction to the views of the national wing of social democracy, let alone the position of the National Socialist Party.\n\nOn February 17, 1918, V. J. Klof\u00e1c\u02c7 presented conditions on which the national socialists were willing to enter the merger:\n\n1. Class struggle to achieve a class-free socialist system of government.\n\n2. New International of equal nations.\n\n3. There is no evolution without revolution.\n\n4. National state power only has the right of authority, a supervisory and regulatory role.\n\n5. Class-based united trade unions.\n\n6. United socialist organization, both political and professional.\n\n7. An independent socialist state of the Czech nation.27\n\nIn social democracy, mainly Modr\u00e1c\u02c7ek's opposition and also part of the nationalist leadership agreed with these conditions; however, the party's provincial conferences refused to accept them. On March 22, social democrats offered the national socialists the formation of a common political body, the Socialist Council, for the sake of joint preparations of the May 1 celebrations and a joint effort in the National Committee. On behalf of the national socialists, who were preparing for the congress, J. Str\u02c7\u00edbrn\u00fd tentatively agreed.\n\nThe national socialists' Eighth Easter congress, held in late March and early April of 1918, was supposed to be the first in a series of steps leading to the integration of Czech left-wing politics into a united pro-Masaryk party. The common Czech Socialist Party, established at this congress, was, apart from the national socialists, also joined by members of the Federation of Czech Anarcho-Communists, Czech Democracy, the Voln\u00e1 My\u0161lenka (Free Thought) magazine, and part of the Progressive Party. The newly formed party also accepted a program drafted by E. Franke, based on the ideas by F. Modr\u00e1c\u02c7ek. Among other things, this program included the demand for an independent state with a socialist form of government, the elimination of the wage payment plan and the transfer of all means of production to the ownership of the nation, which is to entrust trade unions with the production. Socialists demanded the establishment of a two-chamber parliament, which was to have not only legislative, but also executive power. Furthermore, the separation of church and state was to be carried out, the armed forces were to be dissolved and replaced with a militia system, and so on.28 At the same time, socialists declared their willingness to merge with the Social Democratic Party. A. Ne\u02c7mec from social democracy also attended the congress as a guest.\n\nFollowing the failed joint action during the organization of the May 1 celebration, socialist parties agreed to form a common Bloc. Socialists were represented at this informal meeting by E. Franke and B. Vrbensk\u00fd, the social democrats by F. Soukup and G. Habrman. Nonetheless, the nationalist wing of social democracy failed to gain sufficient support for the idea of a merger in their party. Representatives of both parties agreed on September 6 to at least form a coordinating body for the joint steps in the reorganized National Committee\u2014the Socialist Council. The Council, for which each of the parties delegated nine representatives, even included B. meral. A definitive stop to the efforts to unite social democrats with the socialists was put by the congress of the Czechoslovak Trade Union Association, held between September 28 and October 1, 1918. The congress rejected the merger with the socialist trade union organization Czech Workers Community, that is, also the merger of the two political parties.\n\nOn October 14, the Socialist Council tried to intervene in the \"tentative and cautious process of the National Committee and take radical action.\"29 In connection with the preparation of the general strike against the export of foodstuffs from the Czech lands, the Action Committee of the Socialist Council30 decided to stage a coup. According to the instructions issued by the Action Committee, the speakers at the demonstrations were to declare \"our independence in the sense of a sovereign Czech republic. Emphasis was put on the execution of the principles of democracy in our state and the resolution of important socialist problems.\"31 Such a strike caused a fierce conflict among Czech parties. In the end, the bourgeois bloc thwarted the socialists' efforts and accused the Socialist Council of disloyalty to the National Committee. meral, accused of establishing a Bolshevik soviet, was forced to leave the highest echelons of politics, not only in the National Committee, but also in his own party. Following the plan's failure, the Socialist Council was subordinated to the National Committee.\n\nNotes\n\n1. The Czech provincial assembly had closed down the year before.\n\n2.

Although even after the proclamation of an independent Czechoslovakia the leadership of both political parties attempted a joint action, the development within the parties, the signs of which started to show already before October 28, 1918, accelerated after the establishment of the sovereign republic, which resulted in the gap between the two parties getting even bigger. On the official, especially the governmental level, socialists and social democrats declare unity as late as in November of 1918.\n\nIn mid-November of 1918, the played-out Socialist Council is replaced by the so-called Socialist Bloc, which \"in its joint proclamation emphasized it wanted to build the republic in collaboration with all other parties.\"1 Both parties claim support for the politics of the all-national coalition and two days later send their representatives to the government of the Prime Minister Karel Kram\u00e1r\u02c7. The social democratic members of the cabinet were F. Soukup as minister of justice, G. Habrman as minister of education and L. Winter as minister of social affairs; the socialists were represented by V. Klof\u00e1c\u02c7 as minister of national defense, J. Str\u02c7\u00edbrn\u00fd as minister of post and telegraphs, and the anarchist B. Vrbensk\u00fd was appointed minister of supply.\n\nDespite the relatively conservative representation of parties and political figures in the cabinet, including the prime minister, in the first few months of its existence, the government practices very radical politics. \"As one of only a handful of countries around the world, already in December of 1918, C\u02c7SR (Czechoslovak Republic) passed a law introducing an eight-hour workday, implemented generous welfare for the unemployed and war veterans, and distrained estates.\"2 However, not even these radical and a few months previously totally unthinkable measures managed to calm down the disorderly crowds, struck by the postwar revolutionary wave, who demanded the transformation of the republic into a socialist, if not directly a Bolshevik nation.\n\nBoth socialist parties provided support for President T. G. Masaryk. The main supporting pillar of Masaryk's politics was the socialist party, in which he found common ground with J. Str\u02c7\u00edbrn\u00fd. When Foreign Minister Bene\u0161 was deciding which political party to join, based on consultations with Masaryk, he chose the Czechoslovak Socialist Party. Social democracy, \"not having its own professionally educated theoreticians, accepted . . . fully Masaryk's views, while emphasizing the need for evolutionary development.\"3 However, this trend was in contradiction with the Marxist program of revolution, which the party officially professed. Therefore, alongside the pro-Masaryk stream within social democracy, a left-oriented wing started to form, which stood against the existing establishment in Czechoslovakia and promoted the idea of a world revolution.\n\nSituation in the Social Democratic Party\n\nDevelopment of the Bolshevik Platform in Czechoslovak  \nSocial Democracy\n\nThe first noticeable presentation of a platform which identified itself with the vision of the spread of the Bolshevik revolution from Russia was the Twelfth congress of the Czechoslovak Social Democratic Workers' Party, held in Prague from December 27 to 30, 1918. It was at this congress, which among other things renamed the party Czechoslovak, that supporters of the Czechoslovak Communist Party in Russia, formed in May of 1918 by the pro-Bolshevik supporters of social democracy in Russia,4 officially presented themselves. The most significant representative of the Czech communists was Alois Mun\u02c7a.5 Apart from this stream, there also starts to be constituted the local communist platform, represented mainly by the Kladno organization. This group, whose unofficial spokesman is Anton\u00edn Z\u00e1potock\u00fd, castigates the party's participation in the government side by side with bourgeois parties and also rejects attempts at a merger with the socialist party. At the congress, Z\u00e1potock\u00fd comments on this issue: \"It seems to me that the proposal for a merger comes late. It is not the idea of unity that captivates workers; there is yet another idea which surpasses it. It is the idea of a revolution which interests them more. The idea of the revolution of the proletariat, brought to us by the Russian Bolshevik comrades and which seizes our proletariat.\"6 At the congress, Z\u00e1potock\u00fd stood by meral, who was criticized for his actions in the Socialist Council.7\n\nOn the contrary, the negotiations on the possible merger were positively commented on, although only retroactively, by J. Hudec, a supporter of Modr\u00e1c\u02c7ek's group in social democracy. In his opinion, \"the congress discussed the merger of the socialist parties in Czechoslovakia, that is, the social democrats and the national (Czechoslovak) socialists, to whose unification the national socialists were inclined. This matter was of interest to the entire Czechoslovak working class and became the motto of the day in both parties. At the social democratic congress, the majority was in favor of the merger.\"8 Hudec does not directly state why the merger did not actually take place; however, the explanation is not hard to find. Even in his opinion, the December congress marks the end of the party's unity. Merger with crumbling social democracy would undoubtedly bring more problems than benefits to the socialists.\n\nThe congress also approved the party's short-term program, which among other things demanded the confiscation of estates, mines, and larger industrial plants, the taxation of war profits, the replacement of a regular military with a militia corps, and so on. Also approved was the presence of the social democratic ministers in Kram\u00e1r\u02c7's government, which can be considered a success for the right wing. On the other hand, the Bolsheviks managed to make their way\u2014although as a minority\u2014into the inner circle of the party's executive committee: B. meral and J. Stiv\u00edn held seats in the seven-member executive committee.\n\nOnly a few days later, the newly elected executive committee had to deal with the question of communists coming from Russia. Following the assassination of the prime minister, K. Kram\u00e1r\u02c7, which took place on January 8, 1919, and which was supposedly carried out by a communist supporter, the executive committee discussed expelling members of the Czechoslovak Communist Party in Russia from social democracy. This measure was passed in a vote 25:20, which very much speaks about the division of power within the party. However, later communists from Russia became regular members of the party and as a result of their presence in the party lines, the revolutionary opposition within the party further crystallized and strengthened itself.9\n\nIn February of 1919, Bolsheviks disturb party discipline when under the editorial leadership of B. meral they start publishing a weekly outside the official party structures\u2014Soci\u00e1ln\u00ed demokrat (the Social Democrat). The first issue of the magazine, published with the motto Proletarians of All Countries, Unite, features an Introductory Word with the following statement: \"To us, October 28 does not mean an end to the revolutionary development. We deem it necessary for the proletariat to drive the revolutionary development through the upper class and further through its goals. We welcome the establishment of the Czech Republic; however, our goal is not only a bourgeois democratic republic, but a socialist republic.\"10 The magazine, which apart from meral's work also publishes the works of Stiv\u00edn, Z\u00e1potock\u00fd, Muna and others, strongly criticizes the participation of social democracy in the government, demands the dissolution of the Revolutionary National Assembly, and also criticizes Modr\u00e1c\u02c7ek's non-Marxist group on the social democratic platform. Editors of the Soci\u00e1ln\u00ed demokrat welcome with enthusiasm the establishment of the Third International11 at the Moscow congress of left-wing platforms in the socialist movement held on March 2 to 6 1919. On the other hand, they provide rather cold comments on the attempts of the former anarchists in the socialist party at cooperation (I will provide a more detailed description of these attempts later). According to J. Skal\u00e1k, cooperation cannot be established with anarcho-communists, who want to eliminate any kind of authority and profess radical ideas of equality. \"The consequence [of anarcho-communism] is not only social ownership of means of production, but an overall socialization of work results and their communal use according to the principle 'to each according to his need' and thus a more or less complete socialization of both one's private and family life.\"12 According to Skal\u00e1k, these ideas have nothing in common with Bolshevik communism, especially because they renounce the teachings of the class struggle.\n\nThe establishment of the communist platform in the Social Democratic Party in late 1918 and early 1919 and its association with the Soci\u00e1ln\u00ed demokrat magazine meant a serious\u2014and as it later turned out, also irreversible\u2014dissension in social democracy. The social democratic leadership was unable to effectively face the rise of the Left in the first half of 1919.\n\nDeparture of Modr\u00e1c\u02c7ek's Group from the Social Democratic Party\n\nNext to the emerging communist Left in the social democratic party, there also existed a reformist group around F. Modr\u00e1c\u02c7ek, which started to form around the Socialistick\u00e9 listy (the Socialist Paper) as early as in the summer of 1917. Modr\u00e1c\u02c7ek's journal\u2014similarly as meral's Soci\u00e1ln\u00ed demokrat\u2014stood outside the official party structure. It has already been said that Modr\u00e1c\u02c7ek rejected the Marxist theories of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the nationalization of the means of production, and opposed it with his own vision of cooperative socialism. His teachings, similar to the anarchist views of the Russian thinker A. Kropotkin, brought him closer to some radical groups in the socialist party. As has already been mentioned, E. Franke let himself be inspired by Modr\u00e1c\u02c7ek's views while developing the program of the new socialist party, and the anarchists, who merged with the national socialists, also publicly supported Kropotkin's teachings.13 Modr\u00e1c\u02c7ek and his views were in conflict not only with the social democratic leadership, but also with the emerging Left, which refused to accept the anarchist opinions that were in contradiction with the Bolshevik axioms.\n\nFrom the very beginning of the existence of the social democratic Left faction, Modr\u00e1c\u02c7ek attempted to push it outside the party lines. He proposed that the leadership expel the leftist supporters;14 however, he failed to gain the support of the moderate right-wing leadership, which feared the party would split. Furthermore, in their struggle against the Left, which was gaining strength, people around Bechyne\u02c7 counted on the support of the Agrarian Party, particularly that of A. vehla, minister of the interior. In April of 1919, Modr\u00e1c\u02c7ek and J. Hudec, another member of parliament, decided to leave the party and founded the Socialist Czechoslovak Workers' Party, which set out to promote the principles of cooperative socialism. Social Democracy, together with the help of other parties, stripped the two members of their mandate.\n\nIn 1920, Modr\u00e1c\u02c7ek's party unsuccessfully participated in the first parliamentary elections,15 and following a definitive dissension within the Social Democratic Party and the establishment of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, it returned to social democracy. The ambitions the party had at the time of its formation, that is, to bring together dissatisfied members of social democracy and the Socialist Party, were unfulfilled, especially due to the quickly shifting views of these groups; I mean particularly the anarcho-communist group in the Czechoslovak Socialist Party.\n\nDevelopment within the  \nCzechoslovak Socialist Party\n\nJust as in the social democratic party, in the Czechoslovak socialist party there were also differences of opinion shortly after the establishment of the independent Czechoslovakia. This trend can be found also in non-socialist parties\u2014as most parties were formed as conglomerate organizations, especially in the period before the parliamentary elections in 1925, various factions splintered off. Especially the anarchist groups that joined the Socialist Party were dissatisfied with the share of power given to them by the party leadership, the majority of which consisted of members of the former national socialist party. Apart from the government seat held by B. Vrbensk\u00fd (minister of supply), anarchists held only one parliamentary seat, occupied by S. K. Neumann.\n\nAnarchists openly voiced their dissatisfaction with their positions in the party at their congress, held on February 1 and 2, 1919. The congress was organized without the knowledge of the Socialist Party's leaders, there was no mention of the congress in the C\u02c7erven (June) or Hornick\u00e9 listy (Miners Journal) magazines, which were associated with the anarchists. \"The organizers even considered not inviting the party leaders; Vrbensk\u00fd and Neumann faced strong criticism by the party leadership for their disloyal actions.\"16 Thirty-four delegates representing 4,600 supporters of the anarchist movement gathered at the congress. S. K. Neumann demanded that anarchists take over leadership of the Socialist Party and expressed the conviction that it is the anarchist groups that must drive the establishment of socialism, that is, cooperative socialism, in Czechoslovakia. In his opinion, \"in neither Czech social democracy, nor the Czechoslovak Socialist Party are there any socialists except for Modr\u00e1c\u02c7ek, and therefore the anarchists are called upon to build up Czech socialism.\"17\n\nAccording to Minister Vrbensk\u00fd, the anarchists agreed with the idea of merging with social democracy; however, they were skeptical of the inner developments in this party. In Vrbensk\u00fd's words, \"they are unwilling to unite with the opportunist wing of the party, led by meral.\"18 Vrbensk\u00fd's statement that he agrees with the revolution in Russia \"from Kerensky up to the Bolsheviks\" undoubtedly alarmed the government parties. Both groups\u2014the Prague group and the North-Bohemian group\u2014let it be heard that they wished to remain in the Socialist Party, but at the same time they demanded their own press institution. Thus, as of the beginning of March, the C\u02c7erven magazine became, as its subtitle read, \"a weekly for radical streams and cultural politics.\"19\n\nThe anarchists' positive attitude toward the Bolshevik revolution in Russia prevented any possibility of collaboration with Modr\u00e1c\u02c7ek's group, which the anarchists considered their ally. It was Modr\u00e1c\u02c7ek who most strongly criticized in social democracy the post-revolutionary conditions in Soviet Russia. On the other hand, the anarchists claimed that \"socialist Russia is the cornerstone of a future socialist Europe.\"20 Neumann, C\u02c7erven's editor-in-chief, gradually shifted from the anarchist position (supporting Kropotkin's teachings of cooperative production) to Marxist-Leninist positions. This development can be seen in the contents of the C\u02c7erven magazine. Apart from the previously mentioned Kropotkin, the C\u02c7erven magazine publishes the Art Program of the Commissariat for People's Education, led by the People's Commissar, Lunacharsky,21 but also Lenin's treatise \"Class Society and the State.\"22 In spite of its radicalization in this time period, we can also find articles in C\u02c7erven by other than left-oriented authors, for example, by Karel C\u02c7apek.\n\nWith regard to the topic of this publication, it is very important that C\u02c7erven is first to deal with questions of leftist culture and the cultural policies of left-wing parties. Apart from publishing informative articles on the cultural policy of the Bolshevik party, such as the above-mentioned Lunacharsky and others, Neumann also makes an attempt at his own approach to this issue. In July of 1919, an article entitled \"Proletarian Culture\" is published under the pen name \"-n,\" in which the author ponders the relationship between the state's political system and culture. \"Our culture is in essence directly as well as indirectly managed by the ruling class, although the majority of the cultural workers, especially the best of them, are proletarians.\" According to the author, the conditions for artistic work are set by the bourgeoisie, which hold the power. Therefore, in order for proletarian culture to be developed, it is necessary that the power be in the hands of the proletariat. \"Our goal is socialist culture (the healthy results of the bourgeois culture shall merge with the results of value of the proletarian culture); proletarian culture is only a temporary means, just as proletarian politics or the so-called dictatorship of the proletariat can be the means to socialist freedom, equality and brotherhood.\"23\n\nNeumann\u2014who undoubtedly wrote the article\u2014endorses the idea of proletarian art, yet he does not accept the class approach professed by the Bolshevik party. His approach is a sort of a transition between the anarchist views before WWI (see chapter 1) and communist views. Similarly as before the war, Neumann puts the greatest emphasis not on the class struggle and revolution, but on education and campaigning.\n\nOn the platform of the C\u02c7erven magazine, the first significant community of leftist artists is formed: the Socialist Council of Public Education Workers, established on July 6, 1919. C\u02c7erven publishes a proclamation, \"To the Entire Productive Working Class in the Czechoslovak Republic,\" in which the Socialist Council is defined by its members as \"for now a free community of several forces envious of the freedom of literary, artistic and scientific work, yet also determined to stand by the masses joining the march into the new world.\"24 The proclamation is signed by E. Ehrenstein, J. Fleischner, J. Hora, H. Mal\u00edr\u02c7ov\u00e1, F. Ne\u02c7mec, S. K. Neumann, I. Olbracht, H. Sonnenschein, A. Sova, F. r\u00e1mek, and F. Werfel. The artists declare the will \"to always be helpful wherever help may be needed in the struggle for a socialist republic, in its establishment and development.\"\n\nSupporters of Neumann's stream at this time clearly distanced themselves from meral's wing in the social democratic party. The article entitled \"Two Types of Communists\" reads as follows: \"Our socialist minority, led by the ideas of authoritarian communism, should understand that its terror could only lead to disasters prolonging people's ordeal, fratricidal struggle, or even the victory of the reaction. . . . Ideas of authoritarian communism cannot be applied in our state permanently. They are in contradiction to the Czech nature.\"25 On the contrary, people around Neumann at this time welcome the establishment of the Third International, which sets them apart from Vrbensk\u00fd's group. Once again, differences appear and deepen between the Prague intellectual group and the anarchists from North Bohemia; however, both groups at this time remain part of the official structure of the Czechoslovak Socialist Party.\n\nDeepening Dissension in Social Democracy, Formation of an Institutionalized Left Faction\n\nDifferences of opinion between the social democratic leadership and the Left faction, which were mentioned in the previous chapter, culminated in mid-1919 due to the positions of the two groups on several events which took place during this time. The first one was the formation of revolutionary epicenters near the Czechoslovak-Hungary border on March 21, 1919 and the Czechoslovak-Bavaria border on April 7, 1919. Especially the approach to the Hungarian revolution resulted in serious conflicts within social democracy.\n\nAs one of the parties in power, social democracy actively participated in the military campaign against Hungary, which involved Czechoslovak and Romanian armies as part of the Allied forces. Its left faction immediately established cooperation with the Kun regime. The cooperation was mediated by a group of Czech and Slovak Bolsheviks, who in Hungary organized the Bolshevik propaganda in Czechoslovakia. \"Immediately following the establishment of the Hungarian Soviet Republic, the Red Newspaper starts to be published in Hungary as an institution of Slovak communists. This newspaper, together with leaflets published in Hungary, informed the public in Slovakia of the objectives of the revolutionary Hungarian power.\"26\n\nThe revolutionary tendencies were noticeably strengthened in connection with the counter-offensive of the Hungarian revolutionary forces, which was initiated on May 20, 1919. The breakthrough, which for a brief period of time meant the occupation of a major part of Slovakia, caused an outburst of dissatisfaction and revolutionary spirit all across Czechoslovakia. Between May 22 and May 27, the situation \"led to large-scale, spontaneous protests, demonstrations against high prices and strikes, which in a number of locations grew into fierce hunger riots.\"27 In many places, the unrest led to the pillaging of stores. The riots were of an organized nature only in the Kladno region, which represented the strongest support for the left wing in the Social Democratic Party. While handling the critical situation, the government managed, thanks to the social democratic leadership, to avoid a harsh military intervention. Social democrats sent their confidants onto the streets, who \"were marked with a red ribbon and used their trust among the working class to try to convince the demonstrators to disperse.\"28 The government also weakened the social democratic Left by arresting a number of its representatives and supporters.\n\nThe development was more critical in Slovakia, where under the patronage of the Hungarian revolutionary government, the Slovak Soviet Republic was proclaimed in Pre\u0161ov on June 16, 1919. Prime Minister Anton\u00edn Janou\u0161ek, a Bolshevik from Kladno, was appointed prime minister of the government, made up of people's commissars, which was formed based on the inspiration of Soviet Russia and Hungary. This government adopted a number of socialization measures, such as a decree on the nationalization of banks, large estates, and factories with more than twenty employees. The ties with Janou\u0161ek were important also for the Kladno wing of the Bolshevik left in Bohemia, where especially A. Z\u00e1potock\u00fd and A. Mun\u02c7a \"maintained direct contact with representatives of the Hungarian revolutionary government, particularly with Bela Kun himself.\"29 However, the existence of the pro-Hungarian Bolshevik republic in West Slovakia was soon terminated by the withdrawal of Hungarian armed forces from Slovakia in July of 1919.\n\nEvents connected with the revolutionary explosion and especially the views and actions of the Left put the Social Democratic Party in an unpleasant situation. The government party was discredited by a group which negotiated with the enemy. The party leaders therefore had no objections when representatives of the Left were arrested and faced trial. \"The arrests were made on the grounds of contacts with Kun's government and its Czechoslovak emissary, Janou\u0161ek. . . . The situation in the party at the helm of state politics reached such proportions that prominent members were arrested for treason and for communicating with the enemy at the time of war between the Czechoslovak Republic and the Soviet Hungary,\"30 J. Hudec complained a few years later after having left the party due to its inability to rid itself of the supporters of Bolshevism.\n\nIn spite of the strengthening dissension, both groups continued to be part of one and the same organization, under one leadership. In the press organ of the Left, the Soci\u00e1ln\u00ed demokrat magazine, an article entitled \"Unity of the Party, Unity of the Working Class\" is published in early May of 1919, in which its author writes: \"We could not split the party. We could not do this mainly for purely personal reasons. . . . We honestly love the party.\"31 The \"right-wing\" leadership did not consider dividing the party either and tried suppressing the Bolshevik faction by cooperating with the Agrarian Party.\n\nAnother event, which in mid-1919 significantly affected the inner development in the social democratic party, was the accession of Tusar's government of the red-and-green coalition, brought about by the results of the municipal elections in June of 1919.32 The elections, in which the socialist parties (not only the Czechoslovak Socialist Party, but also socialist parties of ethnic minorities) achieved a considerable success, caused an increase in the activity of the Bolshevik Left. The Left saw the establishment of Tusar's government as a better chance for the transformation of Czechoslovakia into a socialist state. Three days following the government's establishment, J. Stiv\u00edn rejoices in the Soci\u00e1ln\u00ed demokrat magazine that the anti-Soviet Kram\u00e1r\u02c7 government has fallen, and welcomes the new government dominated by socialists.33\n\nUnder the supervision of the Communist International, the positions of the Left soon reversed when it stood against Prime Minister V. Tusar, who was accused of tolerating anti-Soviet politics. On October 5, the Left presented the representatives of social democracy with a text called Proclamation of Party Tactics, in which it criticized the party's leadership. \"In the area of political administration, social democratic ministers did not hesitate to sign special laws and collaborate in the persecution of their own comrades. . . . Considering the fact that a joint effort with the bourgeoisie weakens the inner position of the workers' representatives, strengthens the bourgeoisie in its resistance and leads to a compromise, by which the bourgeoisie tries to maintain its domination. . . . Social democratic representatives in the government were forced to take joint responsibility for such measures in both domestic and foreign politics, which could not be subjected to democratic and socialist criticism. In particular, it was the unconditional participation in the willful attack against the Hungarian Soviet Republic.\"34 The Left calls on the party leaders to leave the government and return to the \"original, proven methods.\" At this time, the Left starts establishing works councils, which were to become its instruments in industrial plants. However, the Left failed to gain majority support at the two-day conference. In the Soci\u00e1ln\u00ed demokrat magazine, J. Stiv\u00edn summarized the results of the conference rather laconically: \"Let us openly admit that the conference decided on further dichotomy, for the politics of the organization as both the government party and its opposition.\"35\n\nAt this time, the dissension between supporters of the Left and the social democratic leadership begins to deepen more noticeably. In November, the Soci\u00e1ln\u00ed demokrat magazine enthusiastically welcomes the decision of the left wing of the German social democracy to enter the Comintern; less than two weeks later (December 7, 1919), the first independent conference of the Social democratic Left is held. In its keynote address, the Left labels itself as a temporary body within the party, formed in order to press, unlike the Right-oriented leadership, the teachings of Marx \"in both the party's theory and practice.\" As its short-term goals, the Social democratic Left has set out to drive forward the socialization of production and the exchange of products. \"Only the working class can make socialization happen, as it alone can achieve its own liberation. Therefore, the proletariat must be aware of the fact that a precondition to socialization is to take over power in the state.\" The Left also professes the untouchability of the principle of the dictatorship of the proletariat and in the end it endorses the politics of the Comintern: \"We shall demand that the Czechoslovak Social Democratic Party, when it changes its current politics, become its member and take part in building another International.\"36 The keynote address was published only in the second half of January 1920 in the Soci\u00e1ln\u00ed demokrat magazine.37\n\nThe Left faction, which in December of 1919 established itself as a stand-alone organization within the social democratic party, was not strong enough at this point to attempt to take over the party's leadership against the current leaders' resistance. When in January of 1920 the Left attempted to organize a general strike in the Kladno and Ostrava regions, only about 100,000 people took part.38 Both groups tried to suppress each other. The Right fought against the Left by collaborating with other political parties, while the Left gradually took over various positions in the party and asserted its influence in the established works councils. However, the decisive battle was to come at a more convenient time.\n\nPrior to the parliamentary elections, which following the adoption of the Constitution of the Czechoslovak Republic on February 29, 1920, were set to take place on April 18 (House of Representatives) and April 22 (Senate), the Left presented its preelection manifesto, which in terms of its contents was a follow-up to the keynote address given at the constituent congress in December of 1919. The Left criticized the new constitution because it maintained the privilege of property ownership. \"The privilege of private ownership, which after the world war weighs most heavily on the proletariat, was left untouched by the bourgeois constitution.\"39\n\nAlready before the elections, the Left declares that it will reject any other coalitions with other parties in the government. For the first time, the idea of dividing the party appears: \"If there are concerns that the movement of the Left could threaten the party's unity, let it be known that it is not about dividing the movement, dividing the masses, but about splintering elements, which are closely connected with the bourgeois politicians and which have alienated themselves from the class and uncompromising proletarian politics. The movement and the social democratic party will not only not suffer by their departure, but it will gain in unity and integrity.\"40 The Left also stands up against members of the party's right wing taking over the party leadership, particularly the parliamentary group, and immediately after the elections demand an extraordinary congress of the party be held. With respect to the approaching elections, the Left drew all of its supporters' attention to the fact that \"they, as organized members of the social democratic party, are obligated to play the role of the party's agitators and speakers and thus fulfill their duty in securing a successful election for their party.\"41\n\nIn the April elections, social democracy became the strongest political party in Czechoslovakia, having gained 37.4 percent of all votes. The election results of the other parties were as follows: the People's Party 16.4 percent, the Agrarian Party 14.2 percent, the Socialist Party 11.8 percent, and so on.42 A number of experts see this victory as an effective win for the Left faction;43 however, the distribution of power was in favor of the right wing: of a total number of forty-one social-democratic members of parliament in the first count, fifteen supported the Left, while the share of voice in the party's representation was even stronger\u2014for example, the vote on whether to remain part of the red and green coalition on April 29, 1920, resulted in a 41:11 result. The elections were undoubtedly the last joint effort of the two streams.\n\nNotes\n\n1.

During the second half of 1919 and the first half of 1920, the differences of opinion between the former anarchists and the national socialists further intensified. The first sign of the suppression of the anarchists, who formed a sort of a left faction in the party, was the removal of B. Vrbensk\u00fd from his ministerial post. It was at the wish of the Agrarian Party that he was the first to be replaced in Tusar's government by a member of the right wing of the Socialist Party, one of the owners of the Czech Democracy magazine, Ferdinand Heidler. In North Bohemia, where anarchists were quite strong in the union movement, this move caused a wave of strikes.1\n\nAfter the parliamentary elections in 1920, the last of the former anarchists, S. K. Neumann, a member of parliament at the time, left his top political post in the Socialist Party. Four former anarchist supporters got the mandates; however, these four\u2014B. Vrbensk\u00fd, T. Barto\u0161ek, L. tychov\u00e1 and V. Draxl\u2014were not collaborating with Neumann's group at the time. As has already been mentioned, in 1919 Neumann sided with the politics of the Communist International and the Russian Bolshevik Party; the magazine he led then became a platform for spreading communist ideas. Until the parliamentary elections, people around Neumann kept their distance from the social democratic Left, particularly because of B. meral, whom they blamed for his opportunist politics during the war. As of April of 1920, contact between the group around the C\u02c7erven magazine and the social democratic Left intensifies.\n\nIn April of 1920, Neumann and the C\u02c7erven magazine officially support the Comintern. On April 8, an article entitled \"On the Issue of the Communist Party in the Czechoslovak Republic\" is published in C\u02c7erven, which reads: \"From such brew only one thing can arise: a communist party, which would bring liberation from today's confusion and merely by its existence would make others admit their true colors. . . . It is an unconditional moral prerequisite of the future communist party that those who see it as necessary and want to join its ranks stop hiding behind Marxism, anarchism or the Left and, without a compromise and a vain emphasis on various shades of color, call themselves communists.\"2 At a preliminary meeting of the Federation of Czech Anarcho-Communists, people around Neumann decide on the transfer of anarchist groups in the Union of Communist Groups; on May 13, 1920, the Proclamation to the Northern Proletariat is published in C\u02c7erven, announcing the termination of all contacts with the Czechoslovak Socialist Party and endorsing the idea of a communist party. The authors of the leaflet call upon the proletariat to \"put aside any fruitless theoretical feuds, break contact with all social patriots and come together in a united communist party.\"3\n\nAt a workers' conference in Lom in North Bohemia, held between May 23 and 24, Neumann announces the objectives of the Union of Communist Groups. \"Our goals are not riots, useless strikes and hot-blooded stunts, but disciplined organization and raising public awareness. It is up to us to spread and explain the program of the Third International, the program of socialism in action, which finally came into existence following all the utopian and pseudo-scientific straying; our job is to explain and spread the institution of workers', rural and military soviets, get the proletariat acquainted with the constitution of the soviet republic, the proletarian and socialist republic and act with the collaboration of all class-conscious workers with the mind and hands of theoretical as well as practical preparation for a time, when the domestic and foreign situation of our country will call upon the proletariat to fight its last battle against the old capitalist world.\"4\n\nStarting on June 15, the C\u02c7erven magazine starts a new section called the Newsletter of Communist Groups. In its first appearance, the Communist Groups define themselves as \"independent and non-secret local groups of confidants that promote uncompromising socialism of the Third International and carry out preparatory tasks for the foundation of a communist party in the Czechoslovak Republic. . . . Therefore, they cannot be too numerous or accept in their midst people without proper selection.\"5 S. K. Neumann and H. Sonnenschein were entrusted with the establishment of contacts abroad, especially with the Third International. At that time, a member of the Union of Communist Groups, Emanuel Vajtauer, was stationed in Soviet Russia, having left for Moscow in January of 1920. From there, he contributed to the C\u02c7erven magazine with his observations of the Soviet model.\n\nIt is important to note that the Union of Communist Groups was a direct successor of the prewar anarchist movement, although the group around Vrbensk\u00fd, who after being ousted from top political posts remained in the Socialist Party, refused to join it. Proof of the continuity of the anarchist movement is the geographical distribution of communist groups, which can be found particularly in North Bohemia. A special exception, similarly to the pre-war era, is formed by the Prague Left Intelligentsia, surrounded around C\u02c7erven, which oftentimes with its anarchist methods assumes the decisive power in the Union of Communist Groups. The Prague group, especially its ideological leader, S. K. Neumann, often used reasons and means which contradicted the policies of the Comintern, and its members sometimes displayed opinions following up on the anarchist past, completely ignorant of the actual political situation and especially the Comintern's demands. For example, Vajtauer in his articles defended the idea that the revolution should triumph in Russia even without the political organization of the working class, that is, without the Bolshevik Party. This opinion undoubtedly relates to the anarchist ideas that all political organizations, including political parties, need to be eliminated.6\n\nThe Union of Communist Groups was established as an exclusive organization, a sort of an avant-garde of communism in Czechoslovakia, and their organizers considered themselves to be the founding fathers of communism in Bohemia. \"Against the essentially correct idea of the Marxist Left to form a strong and influential mass revolutionary party, the communist groups presented their own concept, laden with the remainder of anarchist individualism, i.e. by the effort to form a small, exclusive, purely communist party, a party of leaders.\"7 The organizers of the communist groups did not want to wait with the establishment of the Communist Party for the resolution of the schism in social democracy and believed that it was possible to found the Communist Party right away, even without mass support. This position obviously complicated communication with meral's leadership of the Left in social democracy. Therefore in spite of the similarity in ideology they declared, for another year both groups acted on their own and oftentimes even encountered mutual conflict. This is not meant as criticism of Neumann's group, but I do consider it necessary to point out the feeling of exclusiveness of the former anarchists, who in many cases were artists, journalists, and so on,8 a feeling which was to appear also in later years.\n\nThe Union of Communist Parties also sent its own delegation9 to the second congress of the Communist International, which was held from July 19 to August 6, 1920. E. Vajtauer and I. Olbracht were joined in Moscow by H. Sonnenschein and H. Mal\u00edr\u02c7ov\u00e1. \"They were commissioned to inform comrades Kamil Zeman [I. Olbracht] and E. Vajtauer about the progress of the communist movement in our country and together with them draw up a memorandum on the situation in the Czechoslovak Republic for the Third International and request further directives from the Executive Committee of the Third International.\"10 Following the congress, on August 17, 1920, Sonnenschein voiced strong criticism of the Czechoslovak social democratic Left before the Comintern's Executive Committee. In his speech, he labeled meral an opportunist and in the end demanded that the Comintern recognize the Union of Communist Parties as the Communist Party in Czechoslovakia. However, the Executive Committee refused to accept this on the grounds of the extreme leftism of the Union of Communist Groups. The main reason was the idea that it was possible to build a small communist party; the Comintern at the time was dominated by the stream which demanded the building of mass communist parties. However, it is not clear what role B. meral played in the decision making of the Comintern's Executive Committee, while he stayed in Moscow already from April of 1920.\n\nTwo days before Sonnenschein's speech, the first meeting of the Central Council of the Communist Groups was held in Prague. According to C\u02c7erven, \"most speakers resolutely rejected further waiting and depending on elements that were once again very much of an opportunist nature.\"11 A resolution was unanimously passed to immediately establish the Communist Party: \"Without any further ado, the communist party must be established in the Czechoslovak Republic, which is to be built up entirely on the foundations of the Third International. . . . In the near future (in four weeks at the latest), the communist party must be established and its proclamation, program and organizational rules published.\"12\n\nThe Union of Communist Groups immediately got down to organizing the Communist Party. The editorial staff of the C\u02c7erven magazine distributed membership cards among supporters; the Preliminary Organizational Rules of the Union of Communist Groups were published in the magazine's twenty-forth issue and C\u02c7erven was bound to be subscribed to by all members as the Union's official press institution: \"Each member of the Union is obliged to subscribe, either directly or through the local newspaper delivery service, to the Union's official paper, which at this time is the C\u02c7erven weekly.\"13 In early September of 1920, the \"Conditions of Acceptance in the Communist International\" are published in C\u02c7erven. the magazine's thirtieth issue then brings the \"Message of the Executive Committee of the Third International to the Czechoslovak Proletariat,\" which reads: \"The Executive Committee expects with all certainty that both the Marxist Left and the communist groups will unite their efforts to establish a united communist front in the entire Czechoslovakia. In the near future, an initiative must come out of the Czechoslovak movement to form a united centralized communist party, which would include the revolutionary proletariat of all nationalities on Czechoslovak territory.\"14 Despite this appeal, the relationship between the Union of Communist Groups and the social democratic Left does not get any better, not even after the September social democratic congress, at which the Left gained positions in the party. During the congress (which will be dealt with in a separate chapter), the C\u02c7erven magazine assumed a very critical position in its article on the Union of Communist Groups and the Left Social Democratic Party. According to its author, \"the compromise of a result of the congress of the left-wing social democratic party once again caused chaos among the proletariat. . . . However, blame cannot be attributed to the dissension in social democracy, which is a healthy and natural necessity of the time; what should be blamed is the fact that for tactical reasons the split of social democracy was not carried out in a clean manner. . . . Communists, completely independent of the social democratic party, must go their own way.\"15 The Union of Communist Groups was not drawn in to collaborate, even though the Left promised the Union in an addendum to the Organizational Rules two seats on the party's executive committee; just for the sake of illustration, the communist legionaries were promised three times as many seats.\n\nOn the contrary, C\u02c7erven added oil to the flames when, starting with its thirty-fifth issue, it published a series of letters by H. Sonnenschein from Moscow. In his articles, entitled \"Moscow and Prague,\" Sonnenschein gives an account of his appearance in front of the Executive Committee of the Comintern, where, among other things, he said: \"So far there is still no communist party in Czechoslovakia (the current communist groups exist only of their own initiative). . . . Also in the Czechoslovak Left, whose leaders always depended on the ideas and politics of German and Austrian social democracy, the spirit of Kautsky still lingers on.\"16 Sonnenschein also wages an attack on B. meral as a representative of the Left.\n\nDear Dr. meral, it is said that also you have learned in Soviet Russia that the essence of the Russian comrades is their revolutionary spirit. It is very unfortunate for revolution, though, when it is people like yourself who take the lead, people who have neither the revolutionary instinct nor development; in many ways such people represent a threat to the revolutionary development. . . . Dr. meral, may you have more of the revolutionary spirit and courage, fewer tactics and more common sense, fewer words and more actions.\"17\n\nAccording to Sonnenschein, the Union of Communist Groups, which he considers to be the true communist organization, merges with the social democratic Left.\n\nIt is an ungratifying, difficult, and unpopular role for the Union of Communist Groups to play the part of a guardian, safeguarding that the necessity of revolution is not buried in fruitless discussions and that communism is not compromised among the masses by the opportunist tactics of incompetent revolutionaries! Until then we are forced to distinguish ourselves from the leadership of the social democratic Left, which due to a lack of reason and desire has so far been hesitant to take advantage of the revolutionary crisis in a revolutionary manner.18\n\nDissension in the Czechoslovak Social Democracy\n\nAlthough following the parliamentary elections in April of 1920 the government of the red and green coalition was renewed with social democratic Prime Minister Vlastimil Tusar, his cabinet could no longer count on the support of the members of parliament, who sided with the Bolshevik Left in social democracy. Upon their entry to parliament, twenty-eight left-wing deputies and senators issued a proclamation distancing themselves from the government and thus joining the opposition.19 The text of the proclamation deals mainly with the issue of improving the social standing of the population by way of economic socialization. At its end, the signatories endorse the idea of world revolution: \"We also see the Third, Moscow International as the only possible political body integrating the proletariat of all countries, void of any illusion or self-deceit, and with longing in our hearts we are awaiting a time when also the Czechoslovak proletariat will join it with both word and action.\"20 Despite this rhetoric, left-wing members of parliament did support the government of Prime Minister Tusar.\n\nThe Left's center remained in Kladno. Immediately after the elections, Anton\u00edn Z\u00e1potock\u00fd proposed to the social democratic leadership that the party leave the government, but his proposal did not get the necessary support. Following this failure, the Kladno organization took the lead in the resistance movement against the party's leadership. \"Several days after the parliamentary elections, on April 23 and 24, new works council elections were held in the Kladno region. Fifty local and eight regional councils were set up, and on May 2, at their representatives' conference, an interim Central Works Council was elected. These organizations, copying the example of the Bolshevik soviets, tried ever more daringly to interfere with the political and economic processes in their areas, when next to Kladno also the Brno and Rosice-Oslavany regions were also turning 'red.' The country faced the threat of double government.\"21 As an insert to the Left's paper Kladensk\u00e1 svoboda (Kladno Freedom), the Works Councils' Newsletter starts to be published. The presidential election held on May 27, 1920, also revealed the political positions and goals, when A. Muna received four votes and the former leader of the Slovak Soviet Republic, A. Janou\u0161ek, gained two votes.\n\nThe Social Democratic Party's disintegration occurred in the summer of 1920 in connection with the development of the Polish-Russian war, which started in April of 1920 with the Polish military campaign toward the East, which in essence meant a continuation of the Allies' intervention against Soviet Russia. Although Tusar's government maintained neutrality during the conflict\u2014much to Poland's displeasure\u2014it was accused by the social democratic Left of supporting and supplying weapons to the Polish army. However, following the initial success of the intervention forces, the Red Army launched a counterattack and in mid-August, its units advanced to just before Warsaw. The advancement of the soviet forces gave rise to a wave of revolutionary and pro-communist sentiment not only in Czechoslovakia, but virtually all across Europe.\n\nIn the mid-1920s, the social democracy's right wing looks for ways of ridding the party of communist supporters. On July 12, a meeting is held in the National House in Sm\u00edchov to decide on the organized fight against the party's left wing. The Leftists were supposed to be \"expelled from the party so they could not participate in the congress.\"22 The congress was scheduled for late September of 1920. At this time, fierce fights were taking place as to who should be delegated to attend the congress. The Left pressed for a large delegation to be sent from the works councils, whereas the Right counted more on the so-called virilists, chosen by the party's leadership. After the second congress of the Comintern, at which the conditions for acceptance into the Communist International were passed, the Left practically proclaims itself to be the party's leadership. The Soci\u00e1ln\u00ed demokrat paper publishes twenty-one conditions for entry,23 and although it is not the official press body of the party, it convokes the party's congress.\n\nThe social democratic leadership, unable to withstand the schism in the party, seeks support for its resistance against its left wing in the Agrarian Party and also in President Masaryk. On September 14, on the same day that the party's leadership announces the postponement of the congress till December 25, 1920, social democratic ministers hand in their resignation. \"The crisis of the Cabinet as well as the entire domestic crisis lay in the crisis of the social democratic party, whose communist section ceased to support the red-and-green coalition and was at the time of the resignation of Tusar's government expelled from the party. The measures that were originally proposed by Hudec and Modr\u00e1c\u02c7ek's group in the spring of 1919 and received with scorn, were carried out one and a half years later, when communists had already infiltrated the party through all pores possible, having gained the majority in the party, so in fact the minority was expelling the majority from the party\u2014which soon became evident.\"24\n\nThe Left reacted by accusing V. Tusar of subverting the party. \"Upon Prime Minister Tusar's proposal, the party's representatives decided to delay the congress to December 25, which the Right explained by the fact that the issue between the coalition and the bourgeoisie had ceased to exist and that it was also necessary to discuss in the organizations the question of entry to the Third International. The true reasons for this act of violence was the effort to subdue the Left wing of the party, backed by a vast majority of workers, as at the same time, on Tusar's orders, a proposal was passed by the party's representation to make the party's executive committee take all steps necessary to ensure the party's existence, which in fact meant that uncompromising comrades were to be expelled from the party so that the party could become more acquiescent a tool for the bourgeoisie.\"25 The Left then, by means of the Soci\u00e1ln\u00ed demokrat paper and following the forceful occupation of the editorial office of the Pr\u00e1vo lidu newspaper, convokes also through the Rud\u00e9 pr\u00e1vo (Red Law) newspaper the congress of the Social Democratic Party on the original date. The congress was to show the amount of support the communist Left enjoyed.\n\nThe nationwide congress of the party was preceded by the congress of the Slovak Social Democratic Party, which although postponed by the party's leadership, was held on September 19, 1920, in Turc\u02c7ansk\u00fd Sv. Martin. Of the 128 delegates present, only 11 supported the party's leadership and left the congress. The congress then accepted the conditions of the Comintern and declared the formation of the revolutionary Party in Slovakia. \"The social democratic party in Slovakia was practically eliminated by this congress.\"26\n\nOn December 25, the thirteenth congress of the Czechoslovak Social Democratic Workers' Party was held at the Municipal House in Prague. The congress was attended by two thirds of the delegates.27 The opening speech was presented by B. meral, the vice-chairman of the party's central executive committee. In his speech, meral denounces the politics of the party's leadership for the previous two years. \"The past two years have shown that the system of coalition with bourgeois parties cannot lead to the fulfillment of what the proletariat must strive for.\"28 The congress also declares the new press bodies of the party, so instead of the Pr\u00e1vo lidu (Right of the People) and its Vec\u02c7ern\u00edk (Evening Paper)\u2014both in the hands of the social democratic right\u2014the new official papers of the party were Rud\u00e9 pr\u00e1vo (Red Law) and Rud\u00fd venkov (Red Country). This step led to a change in the form of the former official press of the Left, the Soci\u00e1ln\u00ed demokrat, which starts to focus on articles on the history of the communist movement and other educational activities.\n\nSenator Josef Hybe\u0161 was appointed honorary chairman of the party, which kept the name \"social democratic,\" while the position of the party's chairman was held by B. meral. The congress accepted the condition of the Comintern and approved its action program, which for example states that \"the best form of a proletarian state and the higher type of state administration is the proletarian democracy, the democracy of the working masses, the expression of which is the system of councils.\"29 The delegates at the congress also espouse the Third International: \"The Executive Committee is appointed to immediately establish contact with the Moscow Committee of the Third International to ensure that our acceptance becomes reality. Measures are to be taken to ensure that the general public of comrades be informed of these steps at all times and that the organizations have the possibility to have their say regarding the decision to join and its conditions either by way of a referendum or at the party's congress.\"30\n\nA representative of the left wing of German social democracy in Czechoslovakia, K. Kreibich, also gave a speech at the congress, by which the communist movement in Czechoslovakia gained an \"international\" character in line with the requirements of the Communist International. In his speech, Kreibich, among other things, said: \"What we expect of you is to raise the red flag of international revolutionary socialism and invite us to join you under the flag to create a united, strong war front of the entire revolutionary proletariat of this state.\"31\n\nHowever, in German social democracy in Czechoslovakia, the left and right wings were in balance at this time and acted as one party, as was confirmed at the party's congress in Karlovy Vary in October of 1920. There, the party's Left faction was defeated when J. Seliger, a member of the Right, was elected chairman of the party. The congress also passed a resolution, in which it \"binds the members to absolute unity, while recognizing the right of all members to discuss all problems of socialism according to their creed. Members are to refrain from any hateful, personal feuds within the party, either in the party press, at meetings or in the party's organizations.\"32\n\nIn the Czechoslovak social democracy, on the contrary, the congress of the Left resulted in a definitive schism and practically the establishment of a new, Bolshevik party, which still presented itself under the name of social democracy. meral and the institutions elected at the congress considered themselves the only bearers of the continuity of social democracy,33 while the right wing of the party considered the congress invalid. On September 30, the old executive committee (of the Right) also expelled from the party participants of the \"communist conference.\" On October 7, the left-wing deputies and senators separated themselves from the social democratic parliamentary group and formed a group of their own. The congress of the Left brought about double government, for which the only possible solution was the formal division (the factual division had already occurred) of the party.\n\nThe dissension in the Social Democratic Party was accompanied also by the splitting of related organizations. In Bratislava on September 5, 1920, the Socialist Youth of Slovakia at its congress claims allegiance to the Comintern and changes its name to the Union of Communist Youth Workers in Slovakia. At the second congress of the Czechoslovak Social Democratic Youth held on October 23 to 24, a major difference of opinion arises between the organization's right and left wings, which resulted in the left wing separating and becoming independent. A similar process also occurs in late October and early November of 1920 in the German Social Democratic Youth in Czechoslovakia. In late November of 1920 (November 27 to 29), a congress of the Right34 is held, which in terms of ideology clearly separated itself from the Left. Social democracy presented itself as an anti-communist, anti-soviet, and a reformist party. The collaboration with bourgeois parties thus far was assessed as successful.\n\nI have already mentioned that at its congress, the Left declared it was taking over the party's property. However, the right-wing leadership did not agree with this decision and sought a legal way of getting the People's House Hall, which was formally35 owned by A. Ne\u02c7mec, a supporter of the Right, back. \"The legal proceedings resulted in a court decision, according to which the Left was to clear the People's House Hall as well as the editorial and printing offices. When the Left refused to accept the court's decision, on December 9, the People's House Hall was taken over by the police.\"36 The property was then put in the hands of representatives of the right wing. This event became an immediate cause for a revolutionary outbreak, which turned into an attempt at a communist coup in Czechoslovakia.\n\nAlready on December 10, the Left called a general strike, shortly after joined by roughly a million people. The strike was not supposed to be a mere protest against the occupation of the People's House Hall. Communists also presented other requirements of a revolutionary character, such as putting an end to the persecution of the communist movement and releasing the left-wing supporters who had been arrested during the occupation of the People's House Hall; the resignation of the caretaker government of Jan C\u02c7ern\u00fd; a stop to the confiscations and a guarantee of unlimited freedom of speech; setting up workers' controls at large farms and factories; increasing wages by 30 percent, and so on.37 The Kladno organization led by A. Z\u00e1potock\u00fd took the most active position in the attempt at revolution.\n\nAs in many places around the country, the strike ended in the theft of private property and looting, C\u02c7ern\u00fd's government managed quite quickly to suppress the coup attempt. What helped the swift intervention was that noncommunist parties and other organizations distanced themselves from the strike, thus limiting its support only to members of the communist movement. The social democratic Left was joined only by Kreibich's wing of German social democracy and the Union of Communist Groups. A harsh intervention against the organizers of the unrest made the Left call off the strike and admit defeat already on December 15. More than three thousand people were imprisoned and a number of them were later brought to trial. The harshest, eighteen-month sentence was handed out to A. Z\u00e1potock\u00fd, leader of the Kladno communists. Z\u00e1potock\u00fd commented on the defeat as follows: \"The defeat we suffered led to the conclusion that not even the social democratic Left and its leadership is the element which would be able to resolve the basic and tactical problems the Czech and Slovak proletariat has faced in the revolutionary time following WWI. Also in the social democratic Left there was still much fluctuation and little clarity. There were tendencies towards old-style politicking and individual elitism. Selfish interests of individuals were at play, when for lack of true class loyalty, people could not subordinate the interests of individuals to the interests of the whole. However, learning about all these mistakes and insufficiencies did not lead to depression. On the contrary, it sped up the development of the calling for a real tool of the revolutionary struggle against capitalism, a disciplined communist party.\"38\n\nThe defeat of the communist coup had a positive impact mainly on the activities within the Social Democratic Party. The era of double government came to an end and the position of the right wing as the party's continual successor was confirmed. The Left, which had been hesitant about dropping the name \"social democratic\" from its name, quickly began to move toward the establishment of a communist party. In the following months, the situation on the left side of the party's political spectrum cleared.\n\nNotes\n\n1.

The Communist International called on the Czechoslovak Marxist organizations to establish a Communist Party as early as in August of 1920; however, for the reasons presented in the previous chapter, no major steps were taken to build an international (meant within Czechoslovakia) Bolshevik party until the end of 1920. As of the beginning of 1921, the situation changes.\n\nAlready on January 1 and 2, a nationwide conference of the Czechoslovak social democracy (the Left) is held in Prague, attended by representatives of the left social democratic wings of all nationalities in Czechoslovakia.1 Its participants agreed on an organized joint effort to establish a united Communist Party. The conditions of entry to the Communist International were to be discussed in local, district as well regional organizations, after which the constituent congress of the Communist Party was to be convoked on March 26 to 27, 1921. The conference also demanded new parliamentary and municipal elections so that \"the composition of these organizations corresponded to the change in the electorate's convictions.\"2\n\nApart from the coming together of the left wings in individual social democratic parties, the process of the establishment of the Communist Party is joined by the until then autonomous Union of Communist Groups. I have already mentioned that the editors of the C\u02c7erven magazine joined the general strike in December. In January of 1921, the Union of Communist Groups strongly protested against the trials of the initiators of this strike. In an article entitled \"Traitors Again,\" we can read:\n\nThe treason trials, which are in the works, are the last proof of our bourgeoisie trying to equal in all aspects the old Austria. The trials will not be much different from the treason trials conducted in Austria: in essence it will be one and the same thing. What the trials are about is the suppression of a political and social movement. . . . The bourgeoisie in all countries knows that discussions with true socialists, whose number is rapidly increasing, can be had on just about anything except the war against Soviet Russia. Just as the bourgeoisie looks up to its holy alliance of the League of Nations as its general staff and to Paris as the center point of its reactionary politics, the brave socialists and the revolutionary proletariat look up with all their might, love and hope to the Third Communist International.\n\nYes, our headquarters is in Moscow, as that of the bourgeoisie is in Paris. In old Austria we were imprisoned and persecuted, they called us troublemakers and traitors not because we were nationalists, but because we worked for revolutionary socialism and against all forms of reaction in the state. The old regime is returning under a different flag and different dynasty\u2014it cannot expect the old socialists to act differently under the same circumstances.3\n\nFollowing an extraordinary congress of the left wing of the Social Democratic Youth, which on February 6, 1921, approves the organization's joining the Young Communist International, the Union of Communist Groups calls upon its youth organizations to join the International Communist Youth Union in Czechoslovakia.\n\nOne of the first left wings of social democratic parties to espouse the idea of joining the Communist International was the Marxist Left of Slovakia and Carpatho-Ukraine, at its congress held in Lubochna on January 16 and 17, 1921. The delegates4 unanimously supported joining the Comintern and also approved the action program, which organized the interim Slovak Communist Party until it joined the united countrywide party.\n\nIn late January of 1921, a conference of the Union of Communist Groups was held in Lom, North Bohemia, which called for the creation of a united Communist Youth Union. Two weeks after the February 6 congress, representatives of all national sections agreed on its establishment. The merging of youth organizations and their connection with the emerging Communist Party raised the attention of government institutions. \"Based on Decree No. 7538 of the presidium of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of March 24, 1921, the organizations in Teplice anov, \u00dast\u00ed nad Labem, Liberec, Podmokly, Trutnov, Chomutov, Karlovy Vary, Krumlov, Brno, Ostrava, umperk, Jablonec, Fr\u00fddlant, Opava, luknov and in other places were closed down.\"5 According to Rud\u00e9 pr\u00e1vo newspaper, the excuse for shutting down the above-mentioned organizations was that they were established as associations without respecting the obligations defined by the law, and their activity was directed against the foundation of the Czechoslovak Republic and \"intended to spread subversion in the Czechoslovak army.\"6\n\nThe process of clarification also took place in the German Social Democratic Party in Czechoslovakia. On January 8, 1921, the party's leadership, without J. Seliger, who died in October of 1920, strongly criticized the fact that the Left around the Liberec organization and K. Kreibich had joined the general strike in December of 1920. This act was considered a breach of party discipline and the Karlovy Vary declaration. Shortly afterward (January 9 and 10), a conference of the Left was held in Liberec. Toward its end, the delegates passed a resolution, which stated:\n\nWe demand that an extraordinary congress of the party be summoned, which should make it clear whether the entire party wants to unconditionally accept the twenty-one conditions of the Third International and join it, leave behind opportunism and become an operational party and single-mindedly support the establishment of an international Communist party in Czechoslovakia.7\n\nA week later, on January 17, the Liberec organization was expelled from the German social democracy. The conference of the Liberec region, held on January 30, 1921, called an extraordinary congress for March 12, which was to deal with the conditions of the Comintern. This congress transformed into the constituent congress of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (its German section).\n\nGerman communists in Czechoslovakia at the time were already collaborating with the Union of Communist Groups, whose delegates attended the congress. S. K. Neumann, who represented the Union, criticized the Czechoslovak Left at the congress. \"This proclamation of yours will undoubtedly contribute a great deal to the elimination of the chaos in the working class movement and also to helping open the eyes of the proletariat, which due to its indecisiveness and the lack of courage of its leaders, is still in social democracy.\"8 Neumann's speech targeted B. meral, who for tactical reasons hesitated in renaming the social democratic Left to the Communist Party. Thanks to his position, he came into conflict not only with Neumann and Kreibich, but also caused dissatisfaction in the Moscow headquarters of the Third International, especially after the congress was moved from March to May. The International even sent agents to Czechoslovakia who were supposed to speed up the process of establishing the Communist Party. One of these agents was a Hungarian revolutionary, Bela Kun.\n\nThe constituent congress of the German section at its meeting approved a resolution, which read: \"The congress is fully aware that a precondition for all revolutionary proletarians in the Czechoslovak Republic joining the Third International is the foundation of a united international Communist Party. With today's resolution [of March 13, 1921], a temporary union of the German revolutionary proletariat comes into existence under the communist flag and that of the Third International, and its members are ready to unite with the revolutionary proletariat of other nations of this state in a united Communist Party. When and in what way the unification will be carried out depends on the development of the Czech Left, of which the Czechoslovak revolutionary proletariat expects that at its Whitsuntide9 congress it will also pass a resolution to establish a Communist Party and join the Third International.\"10\n\nWith regard to the topic of the book, it might be useful to mention a not very large, but still very interesting organization, which in late 1920 and early 1921 also undergoes a process of disintegration, caused by the formation of its communist faction. I am talking about the Realistic Club, formed mainly by supporters of the Progressive Party, who after the dissolution of the party in 1920 did not join the Czechoslovak Socialist Party. Toward the end of 1920, the Club, which was of a cultural and intellectual nature, faces a split regarding the view of the general strike and other related events. The Club's right wing, formed around Emanuel R\u00e1dl, rejected the December strike and the idea of the government of the people or revolution in general. In the Realistick\u00e1 str\u00e1\u017e (Realistic Guard) magazine, R\u00e1dl writes: \"People without leaders are an anonymous herd, of which it cannot be said that it is right or wrong.\"11\n\nThe opposing view of the social democratic left is assumed by Zdene\u02c7k Nejedl\u00fd, who supported the December strike. At the Realistic Club's congress on January 30, 1921, the two groups part. Nejedl\u00fd leaves the Realistic Club and establishes the Socialist Society, which in May of 1921 professed loyalty to the Communist Party. In the fall of 1921, Nejedl\u00fd's group starts to publish a communism-oriented cultural and political magazine called Var.\n\nIn early 1921, a strong communist wing also forms in the legionary movement. On January 23, 1921, the Union of Uncompromising Socialist Legionaries is founded. The pro-Soviet legionaries proclaim that \"today's state of our government is not in keeping with the promises and ideas we had while abroad, as it only benefits the bourgeoisie and international capital. . . . We do not believe that the bourgeoisie would voluntarily give up its power in the state, therefore it is by force we need to take back the state, which we helped to build and which was taken over by foreign elements.\"12 At its congress on May 8, 1921, the Union renames itself the Union of Communist Legionaries.\n\nPractically the last organization which hesitated with the acceptance of the conditions of the Communist International was the Czech social democratic Left, led by B. meral. I have already mentioned meral's hesitation about whether to rename the party to bear the attribute \"communist.\" Connected with this hesitation is a list of seven points for the upcoming congress, a sort of an action program, which meral publishes on February 27, 1921, in Rud\u00e9 pr\u00e1vo newspaper:\n\n1. Rejection of an isolated revolution given the current circumstances in Central Europe.\n\n2. Rejection of the immediate establishment of a united, international Communist Party of Czechoslovakia.\n\n3. Struggle against the tendencies of \"national bolshevism.\"\n\n4. Rejection of putschism. All political events must be connected with the activities of trade union organizations.\n\n5. Trade unions and workers' physical education clubs shall not be fragmented,13 but permeated by uncompromising ideas.\n\n6. The Communist International headquarters is to be represented by exceptionally capable comrades in Central and Western Europe, who would objectively report true news and would not be under the pressure of their own countries' fate, as was the case of some Hungarian comrades.14\n\n7. Rejection of financial help from outside.\n\nEspecially the second point on the agenda faced criticism and protests, for example, by the Union of Communist Groups.15 On March 6, representatives of the Left passed a proposal of the delegates from Moravia to postpone the party's congress from late March to mid-May. The conference of Communist Women also denounced the procrastination in forming the Communist Party (in fact, there were two conferences\u2014the Czech conference in Prague and the German one in Liberec) on March 12 and 13. The delegates suggested that in case of further delays, the Union of Communist Women should unite with German communists and join the Comintern separately, regardless of what happens in the Czech social democratic Left.16\n\nEstablishment of the  \nCommunist Party of Czechoslovakia\n\nAn extraordinary congress under the name of the Fourteenth Congress of the Czechoslovak Social Democratic Workers' Party (the Left) convened on May 14, 1921, in the Municipal House in Karl\u00edn. The main speaker was  \nB. meral, who explained why he had postponed the formation of the party. The basic idea was that he did not want a rather small communist faction to split from social democracy, but rather he strived to transform it into a mass Communist Party. Therefore, he waited for the wave of nationalism which captivated Czech workers following the proclamation of an independent Czechoslovak state to subside. According to meral, \"on October 28 the Czech proletariat revolted for social reasons, just as legionaries abroad; however, as a result of the disorientation caused by opportunism and social-patriotism, the Czech proletariat wrongly directed its revolt only against Austria, not taking the fight any further, against its bourgeoisie.\"17 According to meral, the current situation is suitable for the establishment of a mass Communist Party. meral's speech, in which among other things he analyzes the political situation in Europe, finished as follows: \"We are more than a political party. We are the vanguard of a new life. We are creating a new system, and we also want to create a new type of people.\"18\n\nDelegates of other communist institutions in Czechoslovakia also attended the congress. After the speech, a representative of the Union of Communist Groups, E. Vajtauer, accused meral of insincerity and cautiousness. Otherwise, the congress went as originally scheduled. Out of a total number of 569 delegates, only seven voted against joining the Communist International; all their names were put down in the proceedings from the congress. In its resolution on entry to the Third International, the congress announces the separation of the communist Left from the Social Democratic Party:\n\nThe congress of the Czechoslovak social democratic Left solemnly proclaims its support to unconditionally join the Third International in Moscow. As of this moment, the congress changes the name of the party from the social democratic Left to the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, which in fact marks the actual departure from the party of social patriots. The delegates representing their organizations solemnly pledge under any circumstances to fulfill their obligations expressed in the twenty-one conditions.19\n\nImmediately after the congress, meral came into conflict not only with the representatives of other movements that pledged allegiance to the united Communist Party, but also with Comintern's guidelines when he refused to summon the unifying congress of communist groups and organizations. meral based his decision on a conviction that the organizational unification of all communist organizations in a united international Communist Party of Czechoslovakia would be premature, and if it is not to be a formality, the party needs to proceed with caution.20 This position was criticized by the party's left wing (particularly Kreibich, Bolen, and J\u00edlek), which demanded an immediate consolidation of all components, even at the expense of losing the mass character, which meral so doggedly insisted on. The conflict between the two groups was not resolved until the third congress of the Comintern held in Moscow on June 22, 1921.\n\nSurprisingly smooth\u2014especially considering the past conflicts and ideological differences\u2014was the incorporation of the Union of Communist Groups into the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, when at its Central Council meeting on June 24 it decided to wind up its existence. Its proclamation, published in the C\u02c7erven magazine, read:\n\nThe role of the Union of Communist Groups, rather ideological and moral than an organizational one, in fact finished at the moment when all Left wings of the Social Democratic Party proclaimed themselves to be part of the Communist Party. . . . It would be a mistake, if because of a lack of trust in this or that person [undoubtedly refers to meral], or this or that group, it would not be included in the party.21\n\nThe former anarchists fully submitted themselves (as we will see later, only for the sake of appearance) to party discipline and changed their original decision, according to which the Union was to be dissolved only at the unifying congress.\n\nThe third congress of the Communist International started on June 22, 1921. The Czechoslovak communist organizations sent to Moscow a delegation consisting of twenty-five members, led by meral, whose main goal was to achieve inclusion in the International. However, this was achieved prior to the congress itself at the joint meeting of the Czechoslovak delegation and the Executive Committee of the Third International on June 16 1921. On this occasion, the Executive Committee issued a statement on the situation in the communist movement in Czechoslovakia.\n\nTrusting in the communist proletariat in Czechoslovakia, the Executive Committee turns to the Czechoslovak party to point out a number of phenomena which raise a concern: that is the centrist and semi-centrist tendency, which surfaced during the party's congress. While accepting the twenty-one conditions, the congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party also included a speech by comrade meral, editor-in-chief of Rud\u00e9 pr\u00e1vo newspaper and a faction leader, who first of all strongly deflects from the views of the Communist International.22\n\nThe Executive Committee mainly criticized meral's resistance to a quick merger of all communist groups in a united party. On the other hand, not even the Left was spared criticism, especially K. Kreibich, whose views were considered a bit too leftist. It was the \"leftist deviations\" that the third congress of the Communist International targeted. The Executive Committee approved, although with reservations, the entry of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia as well as its German section to the Comintern, but only on condition that the parties merge as one within three months.\n\nIt has already been mentioned that the congress of the Comintern dealt mainly with the problem of Menshevism, or leftist deviations, penetrating the communist movement. Any tendencies that led to the weakening of the mass character of communist parties were considered Menshevik. According to the conclusion of the congress, in the following period, the communist movement, under the motto of the so-called united front, was to gain support from the proletariat, the majority of whom stood outside the Communist Party. Communists were to set up factions in noncommunist trade unions, communist parties were to be built up on the structure of plant cells. The congress was the first sign of the Moscow Bolsheviks leaving the idea of a fast worldwide communist revolution.\n\nFollowing the return of the Czechoslovak delegates from Moscow on August 27, 1921, a joint conference of Czechoslovak communist organizations was held, calling the unifying congress for October 30. Prior to the unifying congress, women's communist organizations agreed to unite at a conference held on October 15 and 16. Among the most crucial conclusions of the unifying congress, held in Prague from October 30 to November 4, was, apart from the decision on the merger of all communist organizations in the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, also the approval of interim organizational rules, which cancelled the unelected board of representatives of the party and transferred all decisive power to the party's executive committee. A centralized network of communist organizations, ranging from local committees to the congress of the party, was also set up.\n\nAt the end of 1921, a powerful political party with massive following is established in Czechoslovakia, whose actions are almost completely subordinated to the decisions of the Moscow headquarters of the Comintern. What is very important is that not even after the unification could the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia be considered a homogenous organization. All through the 1920s, various influences and ideological differences appear throughout the organization, given by the varied development and the history of individual segments, which under pressure from the Comintern's leadership are gradually dissolved or expelled from the party if their supporters are not willing to sufficiently quickly and consistently change their views and align them with the requirements coming from Moscow.\n\nNotes\n\n1.

In the same way as during the process of the formation of the Communist Party, and also during the creation of the structure of leftist cultural organizations, anarchist communist groups, later transformed into the Association of Communist Groups, played a much more active, and in this case undoubtedly also more important role than the social democratic left.\n\nStanislav Kostka Neumann was unquestionably the most prominent person and a spiritual leader who concerned himself with left-wing culture as early as the end of the nineteenth century. His name appears in connection with all major events in the Communist Party during the era of the First Republic. As an advocate of anarchism, Neumann was imprisoned in the last years of the nineteenth century, and during the first decade of the twentieth century he criticized social democrats for their negative relationship and animosity toward the intelligentsia.1\n\nFollowing his return from the war, Neumann established the C\u02c7erven and Kmen magazines, which served as the tribune for the best Czech poets and writers. The magazines provided young authors, for whom Neumann was somewhat of an idol, with room to write. Neumann was also present at the foundation of the first significant association of leftist artists; on July 6, 1919, the aforementioned Socialist Council of Public Education Workers was founded. Leftist writers founded a free association of socialist artists and in their proclamation declared that they wanted to contribute with all their might to the fight for the socialist republic. Middle-generation writers used this declaration, addressed to the entire productive working class in the Czechoslovak Republic, to proclaim allegiance to the Marxist left, and proclamatively conformed all their actions to its needs. Leftist cultural and political organizations during this time usually came into existence spontaneously and in an unorganized way. Various communist-oriented arts, sports, and educational clubs were formed among workers; however, these never achieved massive proportions and were not even recognized as the general form of cultural organization in the Marxist left.2\n\nWith respect to the topic of the publication, we cannot fail to mention the birth of the Deve\u02c7tsil Artistic Federation, which was officially founded on October 5, 1920, at the Kr\u02c7emencova Street grammar school, and among whose first members we find several prominent names. Deve\u02c7tsil's chairman was Vladislav Vanc\u02c7ura, while the members were, among others, Karel Teige, Adolf Hoffmeister, and Karel Vane\u02c7k. Writings by Deve\u02c7tsil members virtually right after the organization's establishment appeared on the pages of the C\u02c7erven magazine, and its members did nothing to conceal their leftist, or revolutionary and pro-Soviet opinions.\n\nOverall, it can be said that the majority of clubs, with various intellectual standards and membership base, were not incorporated into the party structures of the social democratic left until 1921, and conducted their activities on their own. The exception were anarchist communist clubs, or the Association of Communist Groups, which thanks to S. K. Neumann and other artists associated with the C\u02c7erven magazine in 1919 and 1920 gained a more solid structure.\n\nProletarian Culture\n\nWhen in the mid-1920s the wave of enthusiasm for proletarian poetry subsided, Karel C\u02c7apek attempted a study to define what exactly proletarian art was.3 I have mentioned C\u02c7apek's opinion because he did not take part in the dispute over the character and content of proletarian art and thus kept a sober and, most importantly, impartial stance, although he did intervene in the dispute over the form of proletarian art several times. Let us leave aside his assessment of proletarian art, which at this time would not be based on the knowledge of some important phenomena, but let us rather pay attention to the classification of C\u02c7apek's definition of proletarian art. In his view, there are four ways of understanding what proletarian art is:\n\n1. Art produced by the proletariat;\n\n2. A work of art about the proletariat;\n\n3. A work of art for the proletariat;\n\n4. Art based on the spirit accompanying the rise of the proletariat (collectiveness, spirit of revolution, internationalism).\n\nProletarian art was in no way a thing of one generation\u2014the age difference between its protagonists was up to thirty years\u2014but still the individual generations' views of the contents and goals of proletarian art varied, which often resulted in major differences of opinion. Therefore, it can be stated a priori that proletarian art was not a homogenous ideological stream, but its ideological modifications depended on specific artistic personalities.\n\nIn the initial phase, artists who accepted the idea of proletarian art expressed their views in Neumann's C\u02c7erven magazine. It was no coincidence that the first articles dealing with the problem of proletarian culture were published in C\u02c7erven. Already in March of 1919, in C\u02c7erven's Documentary section, the arts program of the commissariat for Russia's public education was published. The program came into being in Soviet Russia in November of 1918 under the supervision of people's commissar A. Lunacharsky. As of August of 1919, C\u02c7erven published a series of Lunacharsky's articles entitled \"Cultural Goals of the Working Class.\" At this stage, neither Neumann nor anyone else attempted to come up with their own definition of proletarian art.\n\nIn mid-1919, the social democratic left and its paper, Soci\u00e1ln\u00ed demokrat, declared its support for the idea of proletarian culture. In June of 1919, its editors established the Council of Intellectual Workers.\n\nThe time in which the proletariat gains in weight and is often a decisive voice in the Czechoslovak Republic, it requires even the intellectual force among the proletariat to be brought together to strive to create what we call proletarian culture, which springs from the very substance of the nation's core, the Czechoslovak people, of all proletarians in the Czechoslovak Republic. . . . [Proletarian culture] must come from down below, from the needs, the pain and the anxiety of the Czechoslovak proletariat. . . . An example of this new culture in Russia, embodied in practice and in spite of the enormous obstacles, which have brought beautiful and beneficial results, is the work of the people's commissar A. Lunacharsky. . . . The undersigned form the Council of Intellectual Workers, which is to monitor all cultural, arts and ethical issues. To educate, enlighten and create\u2014that is our eager wish.4\n\nHowever, the Council never actually took any action, and there is no mention of its activities in Soci\u00e1ln\u00ed demokrat until February of 1920. This fact only proves that for the social democratic left, culture at this stage was of secondary concern and that it concentrated more or less exclusively on political issues.\n\nThe group around C\u02c7erven, which later transformed into the Association of Communist Groups, further promoted the ideas of proletarian culture and tried to establish contact with representatives of an organization which in their opinion stood alone in promoting these ideas\u2014the Soviet Proletkult, founded by A. Lunacharsky, which \"should have been an institute of proletarian culture, a laboratory, where a new art form was supposed to originate and from where it should have spread.\"5 According to J. Weil, Proletkult soon changed its focus and its activities were cut back. \"The main core of Proletkult's work is the same everywhere: revolutionary cultural production, the collection of emerging elements of the new culture in life, science, art, development and systematization.\"6 In Weil's opinion, the originally creative work, which should have been performed by autonomous local organizations of Proletkult, changed to organized work, centrally managed from the head office.\n\nProletkult was also close to the left wing of the social democratic party, which considered the role of a communist, or rather proletarian artist differently from Neumann and other artists associated with C\u02c7erven. An article entitled \"Main Ideas or Proletkult\" was published in the Soci\u00e1ln\u00ed demokrat paper in February of 1920. Among other things, the article stated: \"Proletkult is not based on the opinion that poets, painters and musicians must only become creative through divine grace. On the contrary: just as part of the economic production falls on everyone, so should a share of art be available for everyone as well. The beautiful must enter our lives, the workshops, and every worker, if at least a little capable, should take a creative and artistic approach in his or her profession. . . . Thus art, having descended from the heights, shall become part of every man's daily life. It will be possible for a worker not only to use his or her skills in production, but also create the product, so far a dead object for him, through his ideas and suggestions. Therefore, Proletkult studists (student workers in Soviet Russia) shall remain in companies, where they can operate in the sense of acquired culture. The current studists are pioneers of the new era.\"7 It is clear that mainly due to the authors' ignorance, Proletkult's evaluation and its prospects and expectations in terms of proletarian culture ranged between utopian and nonsensical.\n\nS. K. Neumann took a much more pragmatic approach when, as an editor of the Kmen and C\u02c7erven magazines, he decided to press the ideas of proletarian culture in real life. In the October 1920 issue of the Kmen magazine, Neumann published an article entitled \"To Poets,\" in which he declared the beginning of censorship of young authors. Among other things, the article said: \"Starting with the next issue of Kmen, we shall no longer publish poems by young poets unless: 1) they are clear in form and understandable to an ordinary reader, and 2) they consciously and with the contents clearly declare support for the socialist state and social revolution.\"8 By doing this, Neumann made it impossible for some young writers to publish in magazines he controlled and transformed Kmen into a sort of artistic institution of the Marxist left. At the same time, he hinted at what type of art he considered social (meaning proletarian). This art form was supposed to be understandable to all people. Its contents were to be based on predetermined clich\u00e9s.9 In terms of form, authors of proletarian works were supposed to use primarily the descriptive style, which was later called socialist realism.\n\nOne of the best literary critics of that time, A. M. P\u00ed\u0161a, who himself was involved in Neumann's C\u02c7erven, opposed Neumann's requirements. In the article \"Socialist Poetry\" he wrote: \"Every creative act is social. . . . Let us not imagine socialist art production in the role of a promoter of common political postulates.\"10 In the article, P\u00ed\u0161a mentions what many supporters of simple and campaigning proletarian art had forgotten\u2014whether intentionally or not\u2014which is that art has an existence of its own, which cannot be subjected to the need for political agitation. Many authors around S. K. Neumann later realized this fact (Hora, Olbracht, Mal\u00edr\u02c7ov\u00e1); however, Neumann himself stood by his opinion until the end of his life, which brought complications to many leftist authors especially after WWII.\n\nIn 1920 there was no specific danger involved in disagreeing with Neumann's concept of proletarian art. The most prominent representatives of this different concept were artists brought together in the Deve\u02c7tsil Artistic Federation. Following its establishment in May of 1920, Deve\u02c7tsil attracted other young artists and commenced its own cultural and educational activities. On December 6, 1920, an article entitled \"U. S. Deve\u02c7tsil\" was published in the Pra\u017esk\u00e9 ponde\u02c7l\u00ed magazine, which informed of Deve\u02c7tsil's existence and goals. According to the authors of the article, an individual cannot achieve great success either in terms of organization or art, which is why it is necessary to unite all left-oriented artists. In their program, members of Deve\u02c7tsil promised to organize lectures, recitals, theater performances, almanacs, and so on. There is an important mention of proletarian art, which is directed at Neumann's \"monopoly\": \"To its activities [meaning Deve\u02c7tsil], particularly to the series of lectures called Proletarian Culture, an invitation was, among others, extended to S. K. Neumann.\"\n\nAs the most expressive representative of the new generation of leftist artists, Deve\u02c7tsil supported the idea of proletarian culture; however, it took quite some time before this rather inconsistent association managed to formulate its ideas of what proletarian culture was. Meanwhile, Deve\u02c7tsil searched for its collective face. Over a period of time, Karel Teige, a literary critic and art theoretician with an extensive general education, became Deve\u02c7tsil's ideologist and driving force. It was Teige who shifted Deve\u02c7tsil to proletarian art, based on theoretical assumptions. Teige regarded Marxism as the most modern philosophical movement and therefore he also considered art based on Marxism the most modern.11 However, the art production of individual members of Deve\u02c7tsil was inspired by different modern artistic styles, which resulted in criticism by Neumann and other \"realists,\" who rejected such work for its incomprehensibility to the ordinary person.\n\nDeve\u02c7tsil was not ideologically unified, either. Especially many Moravian members of the Association did not share Teige's Marxist views; they did not identify with the ideas of the proletarian revolution. This, among other things, led to the formation of a splinter Literary Group in Pr\u02c7erov in 1921, whose spokesperson was F. Goetz. The group leaned toward utopian socialism.\n\nProletkult\n\nImmediately before the Constituent Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, S. K. Neumann presented the idea of Proletkult. His proposal was to build it up based on the Soviet example; however, at the same time he wanted to imprint his own ideas on it. In Russia, Proletkult served as an educational and promotional institution of the Bolshevik party. Artists only conformed to the role which they were supposed to play in favor of communism. Neumann published an article in the C\u02c7erven magazine entitled \"Proletarian Culture,\" in which he analyzed the role of Proletkult: \"Proletkult's role cannot be the suicidal attempt to teach the entire work force to rhyme, draw or play the piano . . . , its purpose is to multiply the creative force serving the proletariat and discover the latent genius hidden within.\"12 Here Neumann slightly abandoned his requirement for understandable art; however, this change of heart was only illusive. As the prominent person of the next Proletkult he always rigorously advocated the principle of understandable art for the masses against Teige's art by proclamative communist artists, that is, art as per C\u02c7apek's category 4 definition.\n\nIn C\u02c7erven's fourth year, the magazine's subtitle read \"Proletkult\u2014  \ncommunism\u2014literature\u2014new art,\" which clearly indicated in which direction Neumann wanted to take the magazine. Already in the first issue of its fourth year, the magazine defined its role in promoting proletarian culture as follows: \"The foundation of a unified Communist Party is a matter of a short while. . . . The tasks will be divided; there will be no more tactical differences so strong as to use up all the strength and cause decomposition everywhere. The strictly political role that C\u02c7erven played will be finished. . . .  \nIt is up to the politicians to lead this force now. It is the job of the cultural workers to continuously uplift the quality of the whole. . . . We could say that C\u02c7erven will become the first attempt at an exclusively Komunistick\u00e1 revue, but the word revue is too broad, compromised and bourgeois.13 We want a lively and belligerent magazine.\"14 Thus, Neumann once again voices his conviction that he represents a sort of an avant-garde, which has a license for the only truly leftist culture. With this attitude he inevitably came into conflict with the political leaders of the Communist Party. At this stage, however, the disagreement in the cultural-political field was not apparent and following the constituent congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, Neumann actively participated in the centralized cultural organization of the party\u2014the Proletkult.\n\nProletkult was founded in August of 1921 as the unified cultural organization of the Communist Party. In the Rud\u00e9 pr\u00e1vo (Red Law) newspaper of August 14, 1921, we can read: \"Based on the resolution of the executive committee of the Communist Party in the Czechoslovak Republic (Czechoslovak department), we have founded a unified and concentrated organization for proletarian culture, Proletkult.\"15 According to the preparatory committee headed by S. K. Neumann, all cultural organizations supporting the Communist Party were to be gradually acquired by the unified organization of Proletkult. According to the article, Proletkult was supposed to concern itself with science, physical education, art, and education. Among other things, a proletarian university was supposed to be established\u2014The Prague Communist College.\n\nNeumann considered C\u02c7erven a press institute of Proletkult. In September, an article entitled \"Proletkult\" was published in C\u02c7erven, which read:\n\nWith the announcement released in Rud\u00e9 pr\u00e1vo newspaper on August 14, after much deliberation, an organization of proletarian culture in the communist sense of the word was finally established. . . . The organization of Proletkult itself will unavoidably be complicated; besides that, it will be necessary to ensure the safe inclusion of Proletkult in the Communist Party, which is currently working on its definitive organizational structure. . . . There will certainly be comrades who, no matter what Proletkult does, will consider its actions useless and not revolutionary, because they will not be rude, dull and noisy. And on the other hand, there will be bourgeois-bred experts, who will consider all actions of Proletkult superficial and wrong, because they will view them as one-dimensional, revolutionary, Marxist and avoiding all unproductive expert philosophizing.16\n\nWith this declaration, Neumann a priori denounced any criticism or disagreement with his concept of proletarian culture, yet at the same time he perhaps unknowingly demonstrated the coarseness and rudeness of the communist movement.\n\nVirtually from the very beginning, disputes over Proletkult's form sprung up. While the party establishment envisioned it as a unified, centralized organization of all communist cultural activities, there were a number of clubs who did not like the idea of being dissolved in Proletkult and toyed with the idea of forming a sort of autonomous confederation of communist cultural organizations, only formally included in Proletkult. These disputes are mentioned, for example, by J. Hora in his article \"On Cultural Activities in the Party,\" which was published on September 23, 1921, in Komunista17 magazine. According to Hora, \"politicians and party organizers envision it (Proletkult) . . . as a cultural and educational action force, which is to ensure the expansion of communist knowledge and understanding, scientific and social upbringing of party members, for which it forms various divisions and sections. This force is part of the communist party.\"18 Hora then continues that those who came up with the idea of Proletkult, including Neumann, have a different concept. \"The comrades on whose initiative Proletkult was founded envision its organization somewhat differently. In their opinion, Proletkult is to become a confederation of various organizational units of the party.\" In the final part of the article, published a week later,19 Hora demands that Proletkult be included in the organizational structure of the communist party and be subject to its leadership. \"Only when the existing cultural and press organizations of the party dissolve in it and become united, will we finally see how much work, which the old social democrats failed to do, there is to be performed by the cultural workers of the party,\" Hora adds at the end.\n\nToward the end of 1921, Neumann closed the C\u02c7erven magazine down so that \"it would be possible to start anew in the new year!\"20 According to Neumann, \"C\u02c7erven has already concluded its role as a magazine for individuals, standing outside the party lines: as an editor I can now merely take part in creating collective work, and thus hopefully give rise to an institute of proletarian culture in the Czechoslovak Republic. . . . The institute of Czechoslovak Proletkult must become a collective achievement, a reflection of the intellectual power and efforts of our communism. Its direction will be determined by the needs of the proletariat, not by the will of an individual or the interest of intellectual groups, more or less leaning on bourgeois ideology.\" Thus Neumann proclamatively distanced himself from the opinions which he had promoted in mid-1921, that is, that it was him and a group of leftist intellectuals around C\u02c7erven who were predestined to organize the cultural policy of the communist party in Czechoslovakia. The merger of the C\u02c7erven and Komunista magazines gave rise to the Proletkult magazine, with Neumann as its editor.\n\nIn the first issue of Proletkult, subtitled \"the Czechoslovak Communist Party's Weekly for Proletarian Culture,\" Neumann defines its goals: \"The Proletkult weekly, as a central institute of proletarian culture in Czechoslovakia, will be a willing and impartial, but also a consistently communist support for the party's cultural efforts . . . it must take into consideration the wider masses (unlike C\u02c7erven) and meet their needs.\"21 On the one hand, Neumann declares impartiality, but on the other hand Proletkult is considered a press institute of the Communist Party and is subject to its supervision. According to Proletkult's organizational rules, a special cultural, educational, and promotional group was supposed to be established in every major city as part of the central Proletkult, with mandatory membership for all cultural workers, that is, writers, editors, teachers, and scientists, who were members of the Communist Party. \"The responsibility of the cultural, educational and promotional groups is to ensure the entrenchment of communist knowledge and understanding, both theoretically and practically. Besides that, they should look after the social as well as scientific revolutionary education of all party members in their respective location.\"22 What is interesting is that Neumann encouraged organizers of the local branches of Proletkult to avoid using the word cell to refer to themselves.\n\nEvidence of Proletkult's inclusion in the Communist Party and the fact that its activities were controlled by the party's leadership lies in the foundation of the so-called cultural committee of Proletkult, appointed by the executive committee of KSC\u02c7 as an \"advisory board, which is to meet when needed and shall not convene excessively.\" Interestingly enough, S. K. Neumann, an editor of the Proletkult magazine, was not a member of the cultural committee.23 The central executive committee issued an ordinance on January 24, 1922, which stated that \"all lectures, courses and educational activities must be held under the auspices of Proletkult and with the knowledge of the respective political organization.\"24\n\nThere is no doubt that Neumann managed Proletkult similarly as he controlled the C\u02c7erven magazine, that is, that he carefully saw to it that its contents were in line with his view of proletarian culture. This approach of his was subject to criticism by some, for example, this is what F. Peroutka wrote about Neumann: \"As our censor confiscates the work of Bezruc\u02c7 and Havl\u00edc\u02c7ek, in Proletkult S. K. Neumann confiscates Neruda's poems on the suspicion of counter-revolutionary spirit.\"25\n\nFrom its very beginnings, the Proletkult magazine encountered problems, especially low readership. Therefore, the magazine often contained appeals encouraging people to increase the number of issues of their subscription, which was considered mandatory. Fast centralization by way of the voluntary merger of cultural clubs and organizations was not very successful, either. The idea that all independent, although proclamatively communist organizations will smoothly and of their own will give up their independence and also their financial resources to be dissolved in the party-led Proletkult encountered resistance. Thus, the KSC\u02c7 leadership was forced to use its influence to achieve unification. Under its supervision, agreements between individual organizations and Proletkult were subsequently concluded. An example of such a deal is the Agreement between the representatives of the KSC\u02c7 executive committee, Proletkult and the Federation of Communist Public Education Associations, signed at a joint meeting on May 15, 1922. According to the Agreement, the Federation of Cultural and Public Education Associations kept its autonomous status and was given space in the party press, however, it could only deal with atheistic issues.26 This agreement clearly proves that the KSC\u02c7 leadership was initially reluctant to execute the mergers forcibly. \"The Federation of Cultural and Public Education Associations cannot be suddenly closed down, but temporary measures need to be taken to ensure its merger with Proletkult.\"27\n\nNeumann himself tried to speed up the process of organizational merger, especially with regards to the upcoming congress of the Communist Party. In August of 1922, his article in Proletkult read:\n\nIt is crucial that the organizational framework of Proletkult be finished by the end of the summer, so that we can all start regular work in the fall. We encourage comrades and locations interested in the idea of Proletkult to speed up the process at their regional committees and demand that regional Proletkults be founded immediately. As soon as the regional Proletkults are organized, it will be possible to proceed with the formation of a network of local Proletkults, which have been growing and spreading only randomly and unsystematically. We need to represent a completed organization at the party's upcoming congress, at least in terms of extent and number.28\n\nIn the same period, a dispute started firstly between the Communist Party leadership and Proletkult and then with the Federation of Workers' and Sports Organizations. The reason behind the dispute was the Federation's request for a grant for its activities. On September 4, Proletkult's cultural committee convened to deal with this request and issued the following statement: \"The central Proletkult (the cultural committee and the secretariat) forbids all of Proletkult's sections from requesting or accepting direct governmental funding, as it contradicts communist honor and it threatens the revolutionary future of the party. Proletkult's head office asked the central executive committee of KSC\u02c7 to issue the same ban for all organizational units of the party.\"29\n\nEven before the regular congress, Neumann as well as the entire Proletkult faced continual criticism from some of the party's representatives, especially A. Z\u00e1potock\u00fd and J. Skal\u00e1k, for whom Proletkult was an intellectual and reformist organization. Neumann tried to oppose this criticism. In his article \"Against Demagogy,\" he says:\n\nIt is the first sign of demagogy to say that the management of all things should only be in the hands of workers, while forgetting about qualified staff, or if you like, to have all the professional employees of the party become mere henchmen of the merely manual labor staff. . . . If some comrades think that the party's revolutionary spirit would be strengthened and guaranteed if only workers were in charge, that is a big mistake: there are only two types of revolutionaries, natural born ones and opportunists, and the clothes that people wear cannot change that.30\n\nAlso in other issues we can find advocacy of Proletkult's existence and activities. An article entitled \"Struggles, Goals and Achievements of KSC\u02c7's Proletkult,\" signed by the pseudonym of Lokalides, states: \"Some comrade leaders from various sections of our party do not view Proletkult as a superstructure of educational and promotional work, whose task is to concentrate this work, discipline it and give it its true communist backbone, but rather as some kind of a novelty, a new club, which perhaps wants to compete with some sections or individuals.\"31 In its follow-up, released in the next issue, the author complains about the conduct of the Federation of the Workers' and Sports Organizations, which often failed to respect Proletkult as an institute of the party. \"Proletkult was designed by its founders as a supervisory and harmonizing superstructure above the promotional and educational sections of KSC\u02c7. Proletkult is not one of these sections, but a party-wide institution.\"32\n\nAll these articles show that Proletkult was considered by many members, as well as entire sections of the Communist Party, a foreign object, some kind of elitist group of intellectuals, and which made matters even worse, led by a former anarchist, Neumann, who permanently got into disputes. To provide a typical example of why Neumann was regarded as an elitist, here is an epilogue to the first volume of the Proletkult magazine, in which Neumann reacts to criticism that the magazine is often incomprehensible to the general masses:\n\nProletkult as the central institute of education and promotion is not intended for the widest circle of comrades, but only for that part which through its self-education managed to reach such a level as to be able to follow the expert explications of certain questions, so important for us communists, in every detail. . . . Proletkult cannot become an institute for the masses, and this should be considered in the judgment of its comprehensibility. We are convinced that it is comprehensible for those it is intended for.33\n\nWith this statement Neumann contradicts his own reasons for closing down the C\u02c7erven magazine, in which a year before he had claimed that the contents of the Proletkult magazine would be decided by the proletariat. At the end of 1922, Neumann was once again the elitist anarchist communist usurping license for the only possible truth.\n\nInitially, Proletkult was included in the agenda of the first regular congress of the KSC\u02c7, held on February 2 to 5, 1923. However, Neumann, somewhat disenchanted, later wrote that \"by request of the party leadership, the paper on Proletkult was cancelled. . . . Proletkult was mentioned only as part of Mr. meral's report, which presented a suggestion of Proletkult's organizational rules.\"34 During the discussion about Proletkult's organizational rules, members of the Communist Youth League attacked the organization's activities and called them cultural-reformist and demanded its immediate incorporation into the structure of the communist party. Neumann defended Proletkult against this attack: \"The struggle which Proletkult, or better yet, its head office has led with various organizations and individuals has always been conducted by Proletkult in such a way as to ensure its organic incorporation into the party and to make sure that Marxist-communist education would suppress all cultural-reformist efforts of individuals or organizations.\"35 Subsequently, Neumann unscrupulously attacked the Communist Youth League: \"What is officially called Communist Youth in our country is represented by several German and Hungarian comrades who are not sufficiently informed about the conditions in most of our organizations and are not familiar with the Czech element in the country.\"36 In the end, in his self-criticism Neumann admits poor communication with local and regional Proletkults. In Neumann's opinion, this drawback should have been resolved by a general conference of Proletkult.\n\nThe conference eventually approved Proletkult's organizational rules, which subjected it fully to party leadership. Section 3 of the organizational rules states: \"All three bodies of Proletkult's secretariat37 are subject to the supervision and the authority of the party executive.\"38 The Proletkult magazine, whose editor was to be appointed by the KSC\u02c7 executive, was subordinated to the press censorship committee, a stand-alone institution that formed part of the party's executive. All organizations of the Communist Party were obliged to subscribe to Proletkult.\n\nLack of trust in the party's intelligentsia seeped through the congress meetings, proof of which are these words from meral: \"Under no circumstances can we allow the Communist Party's educational activities to be conducted parallel to the political activities of the Communist Party; on the contrary, it must be in compliance with political views, daily concerns and needs. In terms of organizational rules, this must be strongly reflected by not selecting the functionaries responsible for the party's educational activities from some men of letters, aesthetes, writers or various other intellectuals, who stand on the party's periphery like kibitzers on the battlefield of revolution, but these should be chosen from among the best political functionaries.\"39 What is interesting is that in the entire text of Proletkult's organizational rules, there is no definition of its activities.\n\nThe overall result of the congress in the issue of Proletkult is the diminished role of S. K. Neumann. Although he was appointed editor of the Proletkult magazine, he had to conform to the party's control. Following the congress, the Central Educational Council was established, whose responsibility was to oversee the cultural workers' activities. This organization, directly subordinated to the central executive committee of KSC\u02c7, replaced the relatively autonomous Cultural Committee of Proletkult.40 The Communist Party leadership assumed a very skeptical attitude toward Proletkult's activities. An expression of this skepticism was a meeting of the Central Educational Council41 held on April 9, 1923. The central executive committee of KSC\u02c7 posed three questions related to the future of Proletkult. The question whether under the current circumstances it was useful to publish the Proletkult magazine was answered by the Council in the affirmative. The Council also supported the magazine's theoretical focus, which the party leadership intended to transfer to a more fictional style and move the theoretical articles to the Communism magazine, which was published alongside Proletkult. The Council also rejected the party leaders' request that next to Neumann's Proletkult, the organization's newsletter be also published, which would be controlled directly by the party's central executive committee. However, the Central Council ordered Neumann to substantially extend the newsletter section of the magazine.42\n\nIn 1923 the magazine experienced a major crisis, caused mainly by a lack of interest in it. Starting with its twenty-seventh issue, it is published only as a biweekly. \"We have reduced its price [Proletkult's price] to half and hope that there will not be a single conscientious communist who will not read Proletkult in his or her own best interest.\"43 After that, in almost every issue we find appeals for more subscriptions and spreading of the magazine. Proletkult finally comes to an end on January 9, 1924 with its thirty-ninth issue. Officially, the magazine was closed down due to a decision taken by the first congress of KSC\u02c7 in order to centralize the party's press. In January 1924, Proletkult merged with the Communism and Agitator magazines to form Komunistick\u00e1 revue. As of this time, it was fully subordinated to Party leadership\u2014it is symptomatic that its first article, \"Goals of Our Revue,\" was written by B. meral. In his opinion, Komunistick\u00e1 revue should watch over the purity of communist ideas, which in practice meant \"not letting the great revolutionary goal out of its sight\u2014attaining power by the proletariat, supported by working farmers.\"44 S. K. Neumann still remained secretary general of Proletkult, a position fully subordinated to the secretary of the Communist Party, A. Z\u00e1potock\u00fd. Proletkult itself focused on promotional and educational activities, while its cultural, or artistic aspect, was suppressed.\n\nDeve\u02c7tsil, the Literary  \nGroup and Proletarian Culture\n\nI have already mentioned that beside the concept of proletarian culture, promoted mainly by S. K. Neumann in the Proletkult magazine, there were also other perspectives on this issue. Probably the best-known view which stood in opposition to Neumann was the concept of proletarian culture promoted by the Deve\u02c7tsil Artistic Federation, whose membership base partially overlapped with that of Proletkult, for example, K. Teige was a member of the group around the C\u02c7erven magazine already in 1919, V. Vanc\u02c7ura was a member of Proletkult's Cultural Council, H. Sonnenschein was even an ambassador of the Association of Communist Groups at the congress of the Komintern, and so on.\n\nThe first presentation of Deve\u02c7tsil's views was the lecture Proletarian Art given by Jir\u02c7\u00ed Wolker. The following quotation provides a clearer picture of Deve\u02c7tsil's views of proletarian culture:\n\nWe consider the current order unsustainable and unjust and believe in a better reconstruction of society. We find the new, specific plan in Marxist principles and view the world through the eyes of historical materialism. Therefore, for us the new art is that of the classes, the proletariat, a communist art. We do not wish to debate its possibility. To us it represents a benchmark and reality. . . . The new characteristic of the new art is revolutionism. An artist abandons the cult of the personal approach and joins in with the multitude of those who are fighting one and the same battle. . . . Collectivism replaces individualism, l'art pour l'artism is replaced by the tendency. . . . The new art will be realistic. With all our hearts we believe in the specific. . . . We will portray facts, which will be reality.45\n\nIn his lecture, Wolker defined precisely what he alone was willing to adhere to. Although his entire work can be critically measured against the resolutions from his lecture, the work of other Deve\u02c7tsil members respected Neumann's definition of proletarian culture only marginally, and with not much success. While Wolker was a true proletarian poet both in form and content, unafraid to even call his own art tendentious, the work of other Deve\u02c7tsil members, led by Teige's theoretical tone, although not forgetting to proclaim their loyalty to Marxism, the Communist Party and proletarian art, was influenced by individualism and modern trends, so patiently and meticulously surveyed and presented to the other members by Teige the theoretician.\n\nIt is not clear whether the individual members of Deve\u02c7tsil were familiar with Wolker's lecture and whether they agreed with it, but their subsequent activities at least did not confirm their inner identification with proletarian art. What is also important is that Deve\u02c7tsil distanced itself from organizing itself in communist organizations, especially Proletkult.\n\nThe Literary Group's sphere of activities was mainly in Brno, where the editors of the Host magazine led by J. Goetz and J. Mahen were located. The parallel existence of the Literary Group and Deve\u02c7tsil meant in fact the division of the \"generation of the twenty-year-olds\"; however, close contacts were maintained between both groups, especially by members of the Literary Group who traveled to Prague. One of them was J. Wolker; another Moravian artist who cannot be ignored in terms of Deve\u02c7tsil's activities was V\u00edte\u02c7zslav Nezval.\n\nJust like the other Moravians, Nezval was also a member of the Literary Group, which rejected Deve\u02c7tsil's enthusiasm for proletarian revolution. If we wanted to sum up his opinions, we could refer to the early stages of Neumann's work. Similarly as Neumann in the last decade of the nineteenth century, Nezval also had his roots in Kropotkin's anarchism rather than Marxism or Leninism. In his memoirs, Nezval admits becoming acquainted with the Communist Manifesto only upon his arrival in Prague to start his studies.46 Still at the beginning of 1922, Nezval viewed Deve\u02c7tsil rather skeptically, as documented in his letter to Jir\u02c7\u00ed Svoboda of March 11, 1922:\n\nThe Deve\u02c7tsil Artistic Federation is made up of several young people who profess approximately the following: away with everything that is here now or that was here before. In the name of Marx and revolution we have founded a literary group, which will use terror to fight everything around us, because what we want from Marx is an austere and strict church as in the Middle Ages. . . . They also wanted me to join Deve\u02c7tsil, but I am not attracted to the masses.47\n\nHowever, Nezval attended Wolker's lecture already as a member of Deve\u02c7tsil.\n\nNezval's arrival in Deve\u02c7tsil meant the end of proletarian art in this group. Nezval the individualist soon drove out Wolker and replaced him in his position as Teige's \"insinuator.\" Just like the other members of Deve\u02c7tsil (with the exception of Wolker), Nezval also more or less unsuccessfully attempted to write proletarian poetry. Compared to the quantity and quality of his modernist poetry, the results of his endeavors were rather dismal. Nezval did not have much respect for Wolker's artwork and plotted against him in all kinds of ways. The following is an extract from another of Nezval's letters to J. Svoboda from December 30, 1922:\n\nAccording to Kalista, Wolker's play [Nejvy\u0161\u0161\u00ed obe\u02c7\u0165\u2014transl. The Greatest Sacrifice] was a total flop and kitsch of the worst kind, but [probably should have been 'and'] Teige wrote to me that the play was very poor, dully conventional and naturalistic. And believe me, George, when I say that in our Anthology [Deve\u02c7tsil], among the works of Seifert and C\u02c7ern\u00edk, the Ballad of the Stoker's Eyes shrinks to a garrulous, traditionalist and tediously elegiac poem, and that Wolker's most recent poem, Dvojzpe\u02c7v noci (The Nighttime Duet) radiates boredom, the poet's overly expressed wisdom and old age.48\n\nIt is no wonder then that at the beginning of 1923, Wolker left Deve\u02c7tsil for the Literary Group. Paradoxically, with Wolker's departure Deve\u02c7tsil lost an artist who dealt the most and the best with proletarian art. Moreover, Wolker joined the Literary Group, which only a few months before had distanced itself from proletarian art and espoused utopian socialism: \"We do not believe in historical fatalism, in pre-determined development of the world to social and economic revolution.\"49 Probably because of Wolker's bad health, Teige refrained from a critical campaign.\n\nAlmost all other leftist artists expressed doubts about Deve\u02c7tsil's ability to create proletarian art. J. Hora objected to the absence of a definition of proletarian art in Deve\u02c7tsil. A. M. P\u00ed\u0161a voiced doubts whether because of their age the members of Deve\u02c7tsil would be able to achieve the goals of proletarian art. At this time, S. K. Neumann paid attention to Deve\u02c7tsil only marginally as he was putting Proletkult together. It was Neumann who partly softened the difference of opinion between the older and middle-aged generation of leftist artists and the young \"generation of twenty-year-olds\" when in his article \"Campaigning Art\" he rejected the idea that proletarian art must serve only as a tool of agitation for the communist party.50 According to Neumann, the goals of proletarian culture were public education and edification of the working class, which was denied this by the bourgeois regime. J. Hora was in agreement with this opinion and added that proletarian art must be diverse.\n\nThe middle-aged and older generation, for whom the proletarian motif and a simple, usually descriptive style were typical, thus gave the young generation space for proletarian artwork. This occurred at a time when because of his illness Wolker's art production was very limited and Deve\u02c7tsil was sobering up from its euphoria for proletarian art. All of its members attempted to create proletarian art, but poems celebrating the Communist Manifesto and other proletarian fetish could not hold a candle to the quality of Wolker's work. Teige, Deve\u02c7tsil's ideologist, still waged attacks in different directions\u2014especially on the Literary Group\u2014from his position as a theoretician of proletarian culture, but Deve\u02c7tsil's own activities gradually started to divert from proletarian art. For the first time, although not last, Teige looked for a way out of a pigeon hole which he himself had created.\n\nA symbolic end to the proletarian chapter of Deve\u02c7tsil came in the form of Jir\u02c7\u00ed Wolker's death at the beginning of 1924. Following his passing, Deve\u02c7tsil still declared its loyalty to proletarian art, but the poetry which its members turned to in the mid-1920s had very little in common with the original design of proletarian art. S. K. Neumann used these words to comment on the diversion: \"The young from Deve\u02c7tsil have done something very reasonable. They are leaving behind the declamations and farfetched theories of proletarian art and are following the voice of their heart. Their hearts are closer to the circus racket and the busy commotion under the tent of the modern 'art world' . . . than the ascetic goal of educating and entertainingly encouraging the proletariat to revolt. I do not reprove them for it, I just state the facts.\"51\n\nIn spite of all the aforementioned criticism and facts, Deve\u02c7tsil undoubtedly remained a group which very noticeably influenced the form of leftist art and culture in Czechoslovakia between the two world wars. Therefore, I will further survey its activities and the activities of its members and followers in the following chapters.\n\nNotes\n\n1. S. K.

What such a front was supposed to look like is expressed in the speech by G. Zinove\u02c7v presented before the Executive Committee of the Comintern on December 4, 1921:\n\nAs the present is a time of division and because we have gained notable power, we can, in certain conditions, collaborate with the Second and Second-and-a-half International in order to bring the wider masses to communism. If we had not split away, we would not have become such a factor that we are nowadays and we would not be able to carry out this maneuver. It is quite possible that we will have more splitting to do, but we will still go up to the socialists and say: Yes, we support a union based on this and we ask all socialists to support it as well. We will make a formal compromise, but we will remain an independent party.1\n\nBolsheviks thus decided to infiltrate and subvert noncommunist leftist organizations.\n\nThe main tool for gaining noncommunist proletariat was supposed to be the activity of the communist groups in the up-to-then united Trade Union of Czechoslovakia. However, when it came to this issue, meral's leadership clashed with the leftist wing of the Communist Party, represented mainly by B. J\u00edlek and V. Bolen. The Left was against communist unionists staying in the united trade unions; moreover, it did not even agree with the mass concept of the Communist Party. According to J\u00edlek,\n\nas a mass party [KSC\u02c7], it must be permeated by a flexible apparatus, which would react to every instruction from the party's leadership and at the same time precisely set the party's direction. A mass of people is not flexible, even if it consists of people with one and the same goal. The mass moves like a mammoth. It's hard to turn around, hard to control. . . . In our party we must not abide solely by the rule of just increasing our numbers. Our joint effort should be to deepen the class consciousness of all party members, enhance the party's strength and strengthen its class character.2\n\nAccording to J\u00edlek, the Communist Party was to be formed as a fairly narrow political body in terms of its numbers, which would be able to function operatively and react quickly to any change in conditions. J\u00edlek's concept of the party as a vanguard of the working class was in direct contradiction to the tactical requirements of the Communist International and also meral's leadership.\n\nThe conflicts between the two groups intensified following the congress of the Trade Unions of Czechoslovakia held in late January and early February of 1922, where communists failed to gain leadership positions for their delegates. Before the congress, the Comintern issued the following instructions: \"The breakup with Amsterdam should in no way have any impact on the unity within trade unionism in your country. On the contrary, it is essential that the unions stick together and remain strong. They must incorporate workers of all political affiliations. . . . Whichever program your congress decides on, either Moscow's or that of Amsterdam, the Czechoslovak trade unions must unconditionally remain united.\"3\n\nHowever, following the failure at the party's congress, the Left within KSC\u02c7 demanded that the communists leave and form their own trade union. This idea was most actively supported by V\u00e1clav Bolen, chairman of the Agriculture and Forestry Trade Union. It was under Bolen's leadership that the union was expelled from the Trade Union for not having paid the membership fees. meral immediately accused Bolen of doing so deliberately. The Communist International attempted to appease the conflict between KSC\u02c7 and the Left. In July of 1922, a wider meeting of the Executive Committee of the Comintern was held in Moscow, at which Karl Radek gave an account of the situation in KSC\u02c7:\n\nThere is undoubtedly tension in the leadership of the Czechoslovak communist party between the group comprised of Muna, meral, and Kreibich on the one hand, and the group consisting of J\u00edlek and Dr. V\u00e1clav Houser on the other. The reason for the dissention between these two groups lies in the fact that the spirit of last year's conflicts between meral and the Left still lingered. . . . The Executive Committee must take the healthy, proletarian and revolutionary part from J\u00edlek and Houser's group and use it to strengthen and focus the right politics of meral.4\n\nFor meral, taking over the Trade Union of Czechoslovakia was also the final marginalization of the influence of the Social Democratic Party. Therefore, he tenaciously insisted on the communist groups remaining part of the united trade unions. However, in mid-1922 the trade unions took steps to get rid of the communist element. Apart from the Agriculture and Forestry Trade Union, also the pro-communist part of the Metal Workers Union and the rather numerous (78,000 members) Communist Chemicals Workers Union were expelled from the Trade Union of Czechoslovakia. In October of 1922, the two expelled organizations merged to form the International All-Union League, the so-called Red Trade Unions, which joined the Moscow-based Revolutionary Trade Union International. Thus, the communists lost any influence in the strongest trade union in Czechoslovakia, for which the representatives of the Left were expelled from the party in September of 1922.\n\nCommunists also tried to negotiate the united front with representatives of the Czechoslovak Socialist Party. In mid-1922, a meeting took place in parliament between the delegations of the two political parties.5 Following the meeting, imek of the Socialist Party made this note: \"Czech communists, not giving up on their ultimate goals, would be willing to form a majority [meaning a majority socialist government] with all socialist parties. . . . They demanded primarily a united front of the proletariat for the current and future struggle for higher wages. They do not wish to take the initiative. That would be our job, to negotiate with the social democrats.\"6 However, the socialists did not trust the offers made by the communists and there were no more meetings between the two parties.\n\nThe only exception was the leftist faction in the socialist party, represented by former anarcho-communists, who found themselves in conflict with Klof\u00e1c\u02c7's party leadership in May of 1922, when they refused to return to the party's name, the Czechoslovak National Socialist Party. Klof\u00e1c\u02c7 strongly criticized the Left and considered them to be communist cells in the party. The Presidium of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Socialist Party then issued a resolution, which ruled out any kind of collaboration with the communists:\n\nThe communist party once subverted a strong social democratic party and now it systematically subverts trade union organizations. By striving to form a united front and mainly the social [probably should have been joint] effort, the communist party pursues a well thought-out plan to infiltrate our supporters and under the pretense of a united front campaign for the communist tactic and, when the time is right, plans to bring about the collapse of our party. All of this is being done on orders from Moscow, which even authorized the use of radical methods of fighting.7\n\nThus the Communist Party did not find an ally on the Czech political scene in 1922 for its tactic of a united front and was forced to rely solely on its own strength, which on the one hand was weakened by disputes within the party, and on the other by the joint action of the other political parties against the communists. For example, the five parties intentionally postponed the local government election scheduled for the fall of 1922, in which the communists could have won positions at the expense of an appreciably weakened Social Democratic Party. According to J. Hudec, \"following the split, the communists were undoubtedly dominant, while the social democrats fought hard to gain one lost position at a time.\"8 The social democrats also maintained their majority of deputies in the National Assembly,9 while the communists demanded a preliminary election in the hopes of a major strengthening of their positions.\n\nOn November 5, 1922, the fourth congress of the Communist International was held in Moscow, which among other things also dealt with the disputes in its Czechoslovak section. The congress cancelled the expulsion of the representatives of the Left and punished them \"only\" by ridding them of all offices until the next congress of KSC\u02c7. This intervention by the Comintern proves that the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia was almost completely subject to the Moscow leadership. The Left was criticized mainly for wanting to publish its own press (the Komunista magazine), which constituted a gross breach of party discipline. The congress also rejected the accusation by the Left, according to which meral had attempted to form a government with socialist parties.\n\nThe demands in the opposition's political program, expressed in its draft compiled by Vajtauer, include syndicalist and anarchist, and therefore non-Marxist and non-communist views. The fact that the opposition backs these views only proves that when it comes to these main issues, the opposition displays an anarcho-syndicalist tendency, which diverts from the main principles of the Communist International. Still, the Fourth congress considers the expulsion of the opposition from the party inexpedient.10\n\nmeral's leadership was also the subject of criticism, especially for its erroneous concept of the tactic of a united front as a coalition with socialist parties, and for underestimating the fight for the united front built from the bottom upward.\n\nThe party must know well that a workers' government in Czechoslovakia is possible only if by extensive campaigning we manage to convince the masses of the national socialist, social democratic and non-partisan workers of the necessity to part with the bourgeoisie, and if part of the agricultural workers and part of the petit bourgeoisie that suffer from the high prices split from the bourgeoisie and join the anti-capitalist front.11\n\nTwo months later (February 2 to 5, 1923), the conclusions of the congress of the Comintern were discussed at the first regular congress of KSC\u02c7. Anton\u00edn Z\u00e1potock\u00fd presented one of the main tasks assigned by the Comintern, which was \"to watch over the purity of the members of the communist party and carry out occasional registrations and parades, check their activity and expel those who turn out to be useless and unreliable, or those who harm the interests of the party.\"12\n\nBohum\u00edr meral claimed at the congress that the leftist opposition led by J\u00edlek attempted to remove him from office in Moscow and thus split the party. meral saw the Comintern's decision to accept the seven expelled representatives of the Left back into the party as a threat to his own position (this concern was subsequently confirmed after the fifth congress of the Comintern). The congress set the motto of a workers' government to be the main goal, whereas little attention was paid to the problems of the communist party's influence in villages. This diversion from the Comintern's instructions was done away with in mid-1923, when the KSC\u02c7 leadership decided that the united front must also include the Agrarian Party, particularly by separating its lower echelons. However, the party continued to declare itself as a proletarian party and refused to integrate agricultural workers. For example, V. Friedrich wrote the following in the Komunismus magazine: \"We know very well that agrarian parties cannot play forever their independent political role. Agricultural workers will either follow the bourgeoisie or join the proletariat. . . . The proletariat has much more to offer the poor from the country and small farmers than the bourgeoisie.\"13\n\nThe congress passed a policy defining the most important tasks, which among other things assessed the state of socialist parties. \"Social democrats discredit themselves more and more every day, there are clear signs of disintegration among Czech socialists. The influence of our party on the masses is good.\"14 The resolution further set the obligation for all party members to campaign among noncommunist workers. Communists who were members of noncommunist trade unions were forbidden to leave them; on the contrary, they were to take advantage of their position to gain more supporters from among the noncommunists. Thus, a mass infiltration of noncommunist parties and trade unions was started.\n\nDeparture of Anarchists from  \nthe Czechoslovak Socialist Party\n\nThe hopes, thanks to which people around B. Vrbensk\u00fd joined the radicalizing national socialist party, were left unfulfilled. Anarcho-communists were not represented in the top positions of the newly formed socialist party, with the exception of the ministerial post temporarily held by B. Vrbensk\u00fd. Together with V. Barto\u0161ek, Vrbensk\u00fd drew up a very radical program of the socialization of the state, which included the confiscation of industrial, commercial, and transport companies with more than twenty employees, tenement houses, former imperial farms and manors, and so on.15 However, this program was not well accepted by the socialist party, and furthermore, in the spring of 1919, Vrbensk\u00fd was removed from his ministerial post.\n\nAlthough unhappy with their role in the Socialist Party, the people around Vrbensk\u00fd were hesitant to follow the lead of their anarchist colleagues\u2014Neumann's Prague Group\u2014who joined the newly formed Communist Party. Vrbensk\u00fd was afraid of a communist coup in the Czechoslovak Republic, which would result in an embargo on Czechoslovakia and thus in the suffering of its people. His concerns were fuelled by the situation in Soviet Russia. Anarcho-communists thus remained as the left wing of the socialist party.\n\nIn 1922, the disputes between the left and the party's leadership intensified and reached a critical stage following the resolution of the presidium of the party's central committee issued on September 24, 1922, which I mentioned in the previous subchapter. As of that moment, the anarcho-communists became an undesirable element in the party, while the anarcho-communists themselves in their actions ceased to take the policies of the party's leadership into consideration. L. Landov\u00e1- tychov\u00e1 played the most active role in the process of alienation when in the fall of 1922 she joined several activities of the Communist Party.16 In spite of the negative position of the party's leadership, Landov\u00e1- tychov\u00e1 demanded that commercial relations be established with Soviet Russia.17 B. Vrbensk\u00fd defended her actions before the party's leadership.\n\nThe beginning of 1923 saw an event which substantially influenced not only the left, but the entire development of the Czechoslovak political system. Alois Ra\u0161\u00edn, a national democratic politician and the minister of finance, was attacked on January 5. Two weeks later, Ra\u0161\u00edn died as a result of the injuries he suffered during the assassination attempt. The assassin, J. oupal, was a bank clerk with anarchist opinions and a former member of the Social Democratic and Communist Parties.\n\nThe terrorist act caused a wave of anti-communist sentiment. \"Several hours after the public learned about the assassination, leaflets were distributed in Prague calling a public gathering as a protest against the committed murder. . . . At the meeting, for the first time ever, a movement which had just started to form only a few months before spoke publicly. It was a movement demanding strict government and welcoming fascism in Italy.\"18 The main demand of the Czech fascists was the fight against the communist threat, but they also supported a major limitation of democratic rights in Czechoslovakia.\n\nFollowing long negotiations and mainly as a reaction to pressure from the socialist parties and the Czechoslovak president, the leadership of the Czechoslovak National Democratic Party finally distanced itself from its fascist faction. The five parties agreed to pass a law on the protection of the Czechoslovak Republic, which had already been drawn up the year before, but the government parties were hesitant in accepting it. \"Following the assassination of A. Ra\u0161\u00edn, the situation objectively improved. The discussion on the bill was accompanied by a fierce campaign against the communist party, which was held responsible for the assassination.\"19\n\nDuring the months of January and February, a heated debate took place in the party press about the chance to pass the law on protection of the Czechoslovak Republic. Politicians and journalists supported the bill in the press organs of all government parties. The only exception was the socialist paper C\u02c7esk\u00e9 slovo (The Czech Word), which published several articles opposing the bill. The articles were written by supporters of the left opposition, mainly V. Borek and J. Koz\u00e1k, who were both laid off from the C\u02c7esk\u00e9 slovo magazine because of the articles. Also against the bill were the former anarchists from the socialist party, who in March of 1923, together with deputies from the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, the Slovak People's Party, parties of national minorities and several deputies from the Czechoslovak People's Party, voted against the bill.\n\nAlready on March 8, the disobedient socialist deputies\u2014B. Vrbensk\u00fd, L. Landov\u00e1- tychov\u00e1, T. Barto\u0161ek, and V. Draxl\u2014were expelled from the party by a vote of the central committee of the Czechoslovak Socialist Party. All of the above-mentioned expelled members joined the party in 1918 as former anarcho-communists. Several other former anarchists (Borek, tych, Danda, Hrdlic\u02c7kov\u00e1- r\u00e1mkov\u00e1) spoke out against the expulsion; however, shortly afterward, they were also expelled from the party. On June 22, 1923, the four expelled deputies were removed from their legislative posts by the electoral court.\n\nThe expelled socialists immediately began to surround themselves with former anarchist groups, gaining support in their traditional region in North Bohemia. From the point of view of this publication, an undoubtedly important achievement was the acquisition of the splinter group from the Association of Independent Czechoslovak Socialist Students, led by Ivan Sekanina. Vrbensk\u00fd and his followers first claimed their expulsion was not legitimate and continued to consider themselves members of the Socialist Party. They also set up a \"splinter\" magazine called C\u02c7eskoslovensk\u00fd socialista (Czechoslovak Socialist), later renamed Socialista (Socialist). In parliament, anarchists joined forces with people who had broken away from the Social Democratic Party,20 forming a joint club called Socialist Unity. Following the electoral court's decision regarding the removal of the deputies from office, on June 28 and 29 the group transforms itself into the Independent Socialist Workers' Party, which supports the idea of collaborating with KSC\u02c7 in the united front, yet it rejects any consideration of joining the Communist Party, \"as they have their own idea of party discipline, and the discipline of the communist party is unacceptable to them.\"21 Vrbensk\u00fd and other former anarchists surely did not identify themselves with the method of democratic centralism, which was implemented by the communist leadership.\n\nDespite their different views on some issues, the two parties\u2014Independent Socialists and the Communists\u2014collaborated in many areas, mainly in organizing the strike movement. When in September of 1924 Brodeck\u00fd's group returns to the Social Democratic Party, the Independent Socialist Workers' Party started to find a way of merging with KSC\u02c7. At the party's second congress on September 26 to 27, 1925, the Independent Socialists voted on whether to join the Third International and merge with the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia; however, the party's trade union organization opposed this decision.\n\nThe Independent Socialist Workers' Party was definitively dissolved at the third congress of the KSC\u02c7, which was held practically at the same time as the congress of the Independent Socialists (September 26 to 28, 1925). Two former anarchists became members of the Communist party's executive committee and L. Landov\u00e1- tychov\u00e1, the most active supporter of the merger, was elected to the National Assembly on the communist ballot in the parliamentary elections in the fall.\n\nThe dissolution of the Independent Socialist Workers' Party meant the disappearance of an interesting, yet not very strong element of an anarchist concept of socialism from the Czechoslovak political scene. The entry of Vrbensk\u00fd's group to the KSC\u02c7 was only a logical consequence of the events that had taken place in Czechoslovak politics from 1918. The reason why the anarchists divided themselves in their view of the forming communist left in 1920 can be found not in the ideology implemented by the communists, but mainly in some individuals, who took the lead of the social democratic left. The anarchists' resistance to meral's opportunism was so strong in so many of them that they postponed their merger with KSC\u02c7 until his formal removal as head of the KSC\u02c7.\n\nKSC\u02c7 in the Years 1924\u20131925\n\nOvercoming the lengthy postwar economic crisis which struck Europe between 1921 and 1923 meant for the world communist movement a need to change their fight tactics. The temporary stabilization of capitalism, as the Marxist-Leninist terminology called the economic growth between 1924 and 1929, did not result in the loss or weakening of the electoral base of the KSC\u02c7. The other political parties had the chance to find that out as early as in March 1924 during the by-election to the National Assembly in Subcarpathian Ruthenia. \"Here communists achieved a real victory, gained five mandates back, while all the other parties gained only four mandates.\"22 The success was all the bigger as laborers, who presented the main support base of the Communist Party, constituted a much smaller part of the population in Subcarpathian Ruthenia than the 40 percent of the vote they got.\n\nThe main tactical issue of the Communist Party even at this time remains the infiltration of trade union organizations affiliated with other political parties. This trend was confirmed by the nationwide conference of the KSC\u02c7 held in Brno on May 4 and 5, 1924. The passed resolution on the tactic of the KSC\u02c7 in trade union organizations reads:\n\nConquering the trade unions continues to be a task for the communists and individual party members' departures from the reformist trade unions cannot be tolerated by the party. The opinion of some party members that all communists belong in red trade unions, formed as a result of the dissension within reformist organizations, contradicts the fundamental view of the communist party of its members' role in the trade union organizations. Communists working in reformist or reactionary trade unions and fulfilling their revolutionary duties cannot be considered lesser comrades and can in no way be punished by their political organizations. On the other hand, disciplinary action can be led against those who are members of reformist organizations but do not follow the instructions of the party regarding campaigning and propaganda. . . . The motto under which we are going to conquer the trade unions will be: One plant\u2014one class international industrial organization. This motto shall be used for promotional purposes, which means that individuals are not to be brought to join the red trade unions, instead, all the other trade union organizations of the particular plant shall be recruited for the idea of a united industrial organization.23\n\nCommunists intended to achieve the proclaimed united front by causing dissension and subsequently taking over noncommunist trade union organizations. Apart from the trade unions affiliated with Social Democracy, the Socialist Party and also partly the Agrarian Party, the resolution also explicitly mentions the need to infiltrate the trade unions of German political parties, which, according to the communists, were to be considered separatist and disrupting internationality (meaning the national internationality of communists of all nationalities in Czechoslovakia).\n\nApart from the issues of tactics, the conference also dealt with the problems of the internal structure of the Communist Party. It is clear from the Resolution on the Reconstruction of the Party's Organizational Structure that it was necessary to give up the territorial type of organizations and instead build up a party based on plant-based sections; the Resolution rejects the expression 'cell' as unsuitable, \"as in Czech it does not refer to an independent organizational unit, but it also mistakenly denotes a mere faction.\"24 Generally, the proposition for changes is rather unclear and refers to the outcome of the fifth congress of the Communist International and the second congress of the KSC\u02c7.\n\nThe fifth congress of the Comintern convoked in Moscow from June 17 to July 8, 1924, was mainly supposed to set the direction for the international communist movement following the death of V. I. Lenin. The congress stated that the failure of the revolutionary struggles in Germany, Bulgaria, and Poland in the fall of 1923 was a sign of the changing international conditions for spreading world revolution. The solution to this situation was supposed to be the Bolshevization of individual communist parties, sections of the Third International.\n\nCzech communists themselves interpreted the term Bolshevization as \"the process of internalizing the internationally relevant qualities of Bolshevism by individual sections of the Communist International, which took place during a tenacious fight for dictatorship and with the assistance of the Third International's leadership.\"25 In fact, Bolshevization means the utter subordination of individual sections of the Communist International to its Moscow-based headquarters and potentially replacing the national leaders who might not want to fully conform to the policies of the Comintern with more loyal communists.\n\nThe Czechoslovak delegation was subjected to criticism for the continuing \"social-democratic element. The entire party leadership, i.e. deputy Dr. meral, deputy Kreibich, secretary Z\u00e1potock\u00fd, and Muna, received a vote of no confidence. All of a sudden, they were criticized for opportunism and the tendency to lean to the right. Part of the Czechoslovak delegation openly spoke out against the above-mentioned leaders and their politics.\"26 Two different opposition groups form against meral's leadership. On the one hand, there was the pro-Stalin group of mainly the young generation (Klement Gottwald, Jan verma, etc.), and on the other hand the people demoted at the fourth congress of the Comintern (J\u00edlek, Bolen, etc.)\n\nmeral attempted to defend himself against accusations of social democratism, which he faced in the second half of 1924, in the communist press. For example, on March 19, 1924, he wrote this in Rud\u00e9 pr\u00e1vo newspaper: \"I wasn't a revolutionary then [before the war]. I was a typical social democrat, a typical member of the Second International. I was a weak politician and I even admit to being a coward. I am fully aware of that and I am not trying to deny it.\"27 However, not even this self-criticism helped meral keep his post of chairman of the KSC\u02c7.\n\nThe tactic of Bolshevization, which the Moscow leadership intended to implement in the national communist parties, displayed one substantial characteristic which cannot be ignored. The International criticized the old leadership of the individual parties for their bad political work; however, what is quite paradoxical is that the representatives of the communist parties until then in most cases had followed quite loyally the Soviet model. Bolshevization was to bring a change of course from this model;28 it was supposed to be based on \"a struggle to take Lenin's theory and apply it creatively to specific historical conditions in individual countries.\"29 This requirement, which was in direct contradiction to the basic principles of Marxist teachings\u2014and which was called Leninism\u2014was naturally misconstrued on the part of many communists, who after the fifth congress started to be called right deviationists.\n\nAs a follow-up to the outcome of the congress of the Comintern, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia initiated a discussion within the party lines, which was concluded by the second congress of the KSC\u02c7, held from October 31 to November 4, 1924. The interests of the Comintern were defended by D. Manuilskij, who repeatedly interfered during the meetings and firmly defended the policies of the fifth congress of the Comintern, against which a strong wave of criticism rose within KSC\u02c7. \"(Manuilskij) managed to ensure the election of a new executive committee made up of supporters of the party's radical direction, entirely dedicated to Moscow. The new executive committee took over the implementation of the bolshevization of the party.\"30 B. meral and A. Z\u00e1potock\u00fd continued to work in the party's central committee.\n\nThe new direction was also expressed in the resolution on campaigning and Leninism, which among other things states:\n\nMarxism and Leninism are an inseparable, monolithic system and only as inseparable teachings can they lead the proletariat to victory. . . . The final ideological victory of Marxism and Leninism over the pseudo-Marxism of the Second International and the entire bourgeois ideological trash, the profound rooting of Marxism and Leninism in the minds of the leadership as well as the grassroots of the party mean the party's real bolshevization.31\n\nThe congress also noted the failure of Proletkult32 as an institution of propaganda, campaigning and educating the communist party, and decided to replace it with a new institution, fully subordinated to the tactical intentions of the KSC\u02c7 and the Third International's leadership. The institution was called Agitprop and it was subordinated directly to the central committee of the KSC\u02c7. Its management was entrusted to the hands of the representatives of the Bolshevik stream in the party, K. Gottwald and J. Guttman. According to the Resolution, \"a group of trained workers must be formed who are familiar with all the weapons of this vanguard theory and who are capable of arming the masses of members with these weapons. It is especially important that the youth internalize this theory.\"33\n\nThe second congress also saw the introduction of the new Organizational Rules of the KSC\u02c7, based on the principles of so-called democratic centralism, whose main principle was \"mandatory respect for the decisions of the higher bodies of the party by the lower ones; strict party discipline and swift and precise execution of the decisions of the party's leading bodies. Members of the party may discuss the party's issues as long as they have not yet been decided on by the responsible political bodies.\"34 What democratic centralism in fact meant was that the views of the highest political body of the communist movement, that is, the Comintern, were always right and any discussion on their correctness was unacceptable.\n\nThe central committee became the highest political body of the Communist Party and all the party institutions, including the press, were subordinated to it. The Organizational Rules also define what factions are\u2014communist groups in other than communist party organizations (trade unions, etc.). These factions were a full-value part of the Communist Party. Communist deputies and senators were subject to an especially strict regime. \"The comrades in Parliament are subordinated to party discipline even more than other party members. They can be removed at any time by the Central Committee or the Imperial Conference. . . . Each comrade, prior to his election, must sign a declaration that he will respect such dismissal and submit it to the Central Committee or the regional committee.\"35\n\nA group of deputies led by J. Bubn\u00edk stood up against the new situation in the party. The right wing, which is what Bubn\u00edk and his group were called, protested against some protest and provocation events that the Communist Party organized in early 1925. Based on the so-called anti-high prices struggle, communists caused mass protests and demonstrations in many places in Czechoslovakia. However, Bubn\u00edk criticized these events, saying \"on the conditions of stabilization, mass struggles of the working class cannot be organized.\"36 Bubn\u00edk and his followers acquainted the Executive Committee of the Communist International with their position. However, the Communist International did not allow any discussion and Bubn\u00edk, together with another deputy, Warmbrunn, were expelled from the Communist Party. They were soon followed by another five communist deputies, among whom were Teska and Rouc\u02c7ek. The parliamentary club of the KSC\u02c7 shrank by almost a third, from twenty-two deputies to fifteen.\n\nBubn\u00edk and his followers then founded the Independent Communist Party, which flopped in the parliamentary election in the fall of 1925 when it gained only 7,854 votes. \"Independent communists did not have a clear political program. They campaigned against Zinovev's dictates, they demanded a purge of the old party and promoted a positive approach to politics as opposed to the rhetoric of revolutionary mottos and gambling with the lives of workers. This faction in no way shook up the old communist party and completely failed in the first election it took part in. It dissolved and a number of its supporters announced their return to the Social Democratic Party.\"37\n\nIn March of 1925, the fifth wider plenary session of the Executive Committee of the Communist International dealt with the situation in the KSC\u02c7. According to the resolutions issued, the problems in the KSC\u02c7 were caused by the temporary stabilization of capitalism. \"In the transition period from the revolutionary boom to a relative calm, reformist illusions gain in strength and the true danger increases, further intensified by the composition of the party's membership (70 percent former social democrats) and the influences of nationalism among the Czech working class.\"38 The solution to the crisis was to be the implementation of the principles of Bolshevization and suppressing or expelling supporters of the right wing from the party.\n\nThe crisis within the party, which affected the KSC\u02c7 in the first half of 1925, meant a signal for Social Democracy to increase its efforts to strengthen its positions. Social Democrats, who in the summer of 1924 came into conflict with the Agrarian Party for not implementing the agreement on a joint effort to enforce agrarian taxes and the law on social insurance, started to sink lower on the Czech political scene.\n\nBy promoting the demands for social insurance, the Social Democratic Party attempted to strengthen its position among the working class, regain its influence and importance, which were lost after the establishment of the communist party. At the same time, Social Democracy continued to be pressed by the politics of the communist party, which criticized the inconsistency and moderation of the social democratic procedures.39\n\nFurther weakening of the social democratic position occurred after the Agrarians managed to at least partially change the customs tariff of agricultural products in June of 1925. The social democratic reaction was to try to speed up the parliamentary elections in the spring of 1926. In the end, together with the socialists and a group around the president, the party managed to arrange for the election's postponement until the fall of 1925. \"Social democrats thought that, considering the inner conflicts within the communist party and the dissension caused by seven deputies being removed from Parliament and establishing the Independent Communist Party, it was the right time for an election.\"40\n\nFor the first time in the early election, the KSC\u02c7 was to show its position among the electorate.41 Before the election, the Communist Party convoked the third congress, which was held from September 26 to 28, 1925. The congress confirmed the course of the Bolshevization of the party\u2014the party's top posts were seized by representatives of the emerging left (for the first time, K. Gottwald was elected to the Central Committee)\u2014as well as the return of the functionaries removed from office following the fourth congress of the Comintern (Bolen, J\u00edlek, Neurath). On the other hand, people connected with the social democratic past of the party were removed from the party's leadership. \"After the Third Congress of the party, one of the founders of the communist party, Bohum\u00edr meral, was also removed from political life in the Czech Republic. It was for his moderate views that he was removed from his leading position in the party at the end of 1924. In 1926, meral left Czechoslovakia and worked in the Communist International apparatus. He returned to Czechoslovakia only occasionally.\"42 The congress also formally terminated the activities of Proletkult. The Independent Socialist Workers' Party, which also negotiated with representatives of Bubn\u00edk's Independent Communist Party, merged with the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia.\n\nThe early parliamentary election in November was a display of the real strength of the Communist Party. The KSC\u02c7 gained 934,000 votes (13.15 percent) and became the second strongest political party in Czechoslovakia, second only to the Agrarian Party. The Communist Party's rival, Social Democracy, finished fourth with 631,000 votes (8.88 percent). In comparison to the parliamentary election in 1920, when the united Social Democracy gained 1,590,000 votes, the Communist and Social Democratic Parties did not seem to lose too many votes in total. What must be taken into consideration, though, is the fact that in 1925, the communists also got the votes of the national minorities, who in 1920 supported the minorities' social democratic parties. The overall election results need to be viewed as a strengthening of the right, proof of which was the subsequent appointment of the centre-right government of Prime Minister A. vehla in October of 1926.\n\nThe disputes and dissension within the KSC\u02c7, caused by the implementation of Bolshevization methods in the party's processes, did not weaken the party too much in the mid-1920s. Especially among the working class, the party maintained a strong influence, which was further intensified by the activity of the party's supporters in noncommunist trade unions. The Communist Party's activity and its success in the election also forced other left-oriented parties to radicalize and shift further to the left, which was mainly the case of the social democrats and socialists.\n\nNotes\n\n1.

From its beginning, the newly formed magazine Komunistick\u00e1 revue (Communist Revue) devoted its attention mainly to matters pertaining to campaigning and propaganda, whereas it only rarely published articles on culture. Also, the Komunistick\u00e1 revue, right from the start, faced low readership. The magazine's first issue contained this wish: \"If we have managed to get more readers than planned, it would be important if the magazine could report on the entire cultural and literary life in Russia.\"1 The author makes no mention of Czech, or Czechoslovak culture.\n\nIn the same issue, the Cultural section led by S. K. Neumann appears for the first time. Neumann, Proletkult's Secretary, subordinated to the central secretary of the KSC\u02c7, Anton\u00edn Z\u00e1potock\u00fd, sees his role clearly. \"For our comrades, working in our education movement, as well as for all other comrades, in this brief overview we want to summarize the important events and significant dates from international cultural (or even anti-cultural) life, if they deserve the attention of the class-conscious proletariat and if they could give them an idea of what is happening in the superstructure of today's society.\"2 Neumann thus gave up on philosophizing on the role and form of proletarian culture and (temporarily) changed from a theoretician of leftist culture to its chronicler.\n\nApart from the Cultural Chronicle, the Komunistick\u00e1 revue also features a newsletter of the education section (Proletkult) of the KSC\u02c7, which in each issue informs about all the lectures and events organized by Proletkult. The newsletter instructs the lower organizational units of Proletkult to consult everything with the central secretary of this organization. All the events approved by the magazine's head office were to be announced in the party press, including Rud\u00e9 pr\u00e1vo newspaper. The Communist Party's leaders thus completely suppressed the cultural aspect of Proletkult, so important for Neumann during the establishment of the organization, and changed it to the party's educational and promotional body. In spite of this shift in the magazine's focus, Neumann stayed in Proletkult and adapted to the new conditions.\n\nHowever, even after the changes that Proletkult underwent, the party's leadership found the magazine's structure and activities insufficiently effective. In early April of 1924, A. Z\u00e1potock\u00fd noted with sadness in the Komunistick\u00e1 revue that \"Our party has its educational section (Proletkult), whose importance and activity constantly grow, but it has not yet branched out across the party in such a way which is required by its role and the need to concentrate and discipline all the communist activities.\"3 In spite of the comment on the magazine's growing importance, it seems that at that time it had already been decided that Proletkult would be closed down. An indication of this is the conclusion of Proletkult's regional conference in the first region of the KSC\u02c7, held in May of 1924.\n\n\"It was said that the section of communist cultural activity is still not sufficiently developed and that in the near future it will be necessary not only to take a clear stand on individual issues, but also to reorganize Proletkult and the entire system of cultural institutions within the KSC\u02c7. The conference issued eighteen resolutions, one of which demands that these institutions be dealt with at the earliest congress of the party and for which the work council is to prepare its propositions.\"4\n\nFollowing the fifth congress of the Comintern, the Komunistick\u00e1 revue, and also Proletkult, starts dealing with the topic of the Bolshevization in the area of theoretical and educational work. V. Friedrich presents these propositions:\n\n1. To gather capable comrades around the Komunistick\u00e1 revue; enhance its quality and expand it.\n\n2. To perfectly organize a centralized school and raise interest in it mainly among working class youth.\n\n3. To organize short courses in Leninism and have communist confidents from plants attend them.\n\n4. To publish a theoretical-popular supplement with the Saturday's issue of Rud\u00e9 pr\u00e1vo newspaper, which would acquaint people with the basics of Marxism-Leninism.\n\n5. To revive the Communist Publishing House.\n\n6. To pay more attention to Proletkult and get it suitably involved in the above-mentioned activities.5\n\nThe role that Friedrich set out for Proletkult foreshadowed the events at the second congress of the KSC\u02c7. At the congress, Neumann presented a report on the activities of Proletkult, in which he noted that the party's cultural activities are stagnant. This was caused by the low interest in the lectures as well as Proletkult's press itself. Neumann complained about the lack of interest in reading the magazine by the workers. However, considering the intellectual structure of Proletkult, rather difficult for the lay public to read, and the fact that the overall share of intellectuals among the Communist Party's members was merely half a percent, the lack of interest is not surprising. Neumann also criticized several cultural organizations, which, in spite of the directives of the executive committee of the KSC\u02c7, were not incorporated into the structure of Proletkult.6 On the orders of the party's leadership (the task was to be set at the October Imperial Conference of Proletkult), Neumann drew up Principles of Educational and Propagandistic Activity, whose fifth point proposed the cancellation of Proletkult, which as an institution of propaganda was detached from politics. According to Neumann, the campaigning, propagandistic, and cultural activities were to be incorporated into the political apparatus of the party.\n\nAfter the second congress of the KSC\u02c7, Neumann leaves all official cultural and political institutions of the Communist Party7 and also stops contributing to the Komunistick\u00e1 revue. In 1925, he sets up his own magazine, Reflektor (Spotlight), in which he continues to express ideas of proletarian culture. Away from the official structure of the party, he gains more room for debates with other representatives of leftist culture, especially with the Deve\u02c7tsil group (see the next chapter for more detail). Although the changes in the KSC\u02c7 cost him his position in the party, he welcomed the removal of meral, whom he had always considered an opportunist, as well as the party's Bolshevization.\n\nProletkult was not entirely closed down until the third congress of the KSC\u02c7, at which the Organizational Rules on Campaigning and Propaganda were issued, containing no mention of culture whatsoever. The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia for some time gave up on any controlled attempts at managing cultural production by directives of the party leadership.\n\nPoetism\n\nAlready in the chapter on proletarian culture I mentioned the young generation of communist artists gradually being steered away from proletarian art in the form promoted by S. K. Neumann. This emancipation and the search for their own paths culminated in the \"Manifesto of Poetism,\" which K. Teige published in the Host magazine in July of 1924. The Manifesto means a breakthrough in the artistic orientation of the youngest generation. Embracing poetism represented a definite departure of the Deve\u02c7tsil generation from proletarian art and consequently also a \"breakup\"8 with the official line of the Communist Party. The fundamental change from proletarian culture was not a shift to another ideological movement, but rather a sobering up from the unattractive proletarian topics and a move to livelier motifs that were closer to the Deve\u02c7tsil members. \"Poetism lacks any philosophical orientation. . . . It is not a world view, as Marxism is, but rather the atmosphere of life, but definitely not that of the office, library, or museum. . . . Most importantly, poetism is modus vivendi. It is a sign of life and at the same time its fulfillment: It is the architect of human happiness and wonderful peace, unconditionally pacifistic.\"9 It was no longer revolutionary struggle, but quite the opposite, the joy of peace and peaceful living.\n\nThe transformation of Deve\u02c7tsil corresponds with the establishment of closer ties with the Literary Group, proof of which, for example, are the \"Manifestos of Poetism,\" published in the periodical of the Host Literary Group. Also published in the same (June) issue of the magazine is a proclamation by the Literary Group on this close relationship:\n\nAfter the revolution, the young joined the literary circles in close-knit groups and collectively clarified their opinions, formulated their positions on the basic phenomena, built up new aesthetics. The general meeting of the Literary Group brings a decisive turnaround. The majority, which voted for the binding collaboration between Deve\u02c7tsil and other groups of the young generation in the Host magazine, expressed their opinion that today all these groups and collective organizations of intellectual workers become mere clubs, whose purpose is to execute such functions, which an individual would be incapable of doing alone (publishing a magazine, etc.). A poet frees himself spiritually from any collectively formulated programs. . . . Today it is not about fulfilling a program\u2014but about the modern creation of values. . . .  \nWe will each go our own way\u2014and still, we are sure that we will go in the same direction. That is why we join forces with our friends from Deve\u02c7tsil.10\n\nThus the Host magazine was to become a common platform for the entire young generation to publish in, regardless of their individual political views. The most significant act is the declaration of individual freedom in artistic production. This shift from proletarianism at any cost to emphasizing the quality of artwork was viewed rather ambivalently.\n\nOne of the views pointed out the connection between Deve\u02c7tsil's diversion from proletarian art and the death of J. Wolker. This connection was mentioned in the Pr\u02c7erod (Transformation) magazine by J. Kopta. Kopta criticizes mainly Teige, who in his opinion \"first as a proletarian theoretician shot at everything else, including S. K. Neumann's civilism, only later to completely turn around. . . . It seems that with Wolker's passing, his fellow Deve\u02c7tsil members rediscovered freedom for their artistic work. Exhausted and bored by the constantly recurring motifs, which Wolker was good at finding new and rich ways of putting in verse, they gladly escaped the straitjacket of the program order.\"11\n\nThe official newspapers of the Communist Party unanimously denounced Deve\u02c7tsil. On August 17, 1924, the Rovnost (Equality) magazine published an article entitled \"Deve\u02c7tsil's Step Back,\" which reads: \"The poets did not want to debate the possibility of class-conscious Marxist art\u2014and now we see a sort of a withdrawal. Poet Seifert and graphic artist Teige join the Literary group. . . . For them, Marxism was only an experiment.\" The article further speaks highly of the older generation of artists, who continued to be loyal to proletarian art, and thus also to the Communist Party.\n\nOn behalf of Deve\u02c7tsil, A. C\u02c7ern\u00edk responded to the wave of criticism, as both Teige and Seifert were in Paris at the time.12 In his article \"Deve\u02c7tsil's Step Back?\"13 he argues against the opinions and accusations of those who criticized Deve\u02c7tsil. C\u02c7ern\u00edk characterizes the \"step back\" as a step toward \"freeing art from the submissive and inferior role of a dependent voice of the party's political program.\" He draws attention to the fact that the Literary Group openly abandoned utopian socialism and that Host was to become the magazine of a particular generation, not ideology.\n\nS. K. Neumann did not take a clear position on this whole issue. He never concealed his conviction that the activities of Deve\u02c7tsil were not in terms of campaigning of any relevant importance to the party, and therefore its work could not in fact be interpreted as proletarian art. In his position as Proletkult's secretary, appointed and directed by the executive committee of the KSC\u02c7, he also had to denounce Deve\u02c7tsil politically. While in late 1923, when the actual diversion of Deve\u02c7tsil from proletarian art was already noticeable, Neumann actually welcomed Deve\u02c7tsil's departure; following Deve\u02c7tsil's open statement, Neumann, as a representative of the communist party, had to respond with public criticism. This occurred at a time of deep crisis in Proletkult, when its own end was drawing near.\n\nDeve\u02c7tsil responded to Neumann's criticism in the P\u00e1smo revue.\n\nS. K. Neumann worries about our future and in the name of Proletkult publicly repudiates Deve\u02c7tsil in the Rud\u00e9 pr\u00e1vo newspaper. However, what else are we doing but fulfilling his original call to keep up with the world's artistic avant-garde. . . . There is a problem, though: the issue of art and the proletariat cannot be solved by agitational discussions on the 'communist education' of young writers. Only good agitation art can be made for the proletariat, which is the only form of art that can educate the masses. The stress here is on \"agitation,\" not on \"art.\" However, we would like to make art. Do not condemn us for that!14\n\nThe most realistic reaction to the whole issue was that from J. Hora, who not only refrained from denouncing Deve\u02c7tsil, but also looked for the reasons that led Deve\u02c7tsil to diverting from proletarian art. One of the aspects he takes into consideration was the political and economic situation. \"The revolution takes too long. . . . What was once romantic and gigantic in the eyes of poets, impatient to see the spectacular end of the old world, is history now. . . . That is why poets abandoned proletarian poetry.\"15 Furthermore, Hora points out the fact (completely ignored by the communist critics) that the artistic value of individual Deve\u02c7tsil members had gone up.16\n\nFor Hora, the \"Manifestos of Poetism\" are a logical reaction of young artists to, in his opinion, the bad condition of society.\n\nThis era does not long for pain. It wants to sing, even on the verge of an abyss, so there is no wonder that young poets also want to sing with joy. The wonders of technical civilization stand side by side with the horrors of political and economic collapse in the poetry of our gullible Nezvals and Seiferts in remarkable harmony. And besides, what else are those ostentatiously proclaimed programs, promoting literature which does not want to be literature, sweet poetry, which does not want to contemplate, but reality like a tree or love, or a passionate longing for happiness, absent in today's world, as some have lost it irretrievably, while others have not yet gained it.17\n\nUnlike Neumann, Hora does not think that Deve\u02c7tsil members should also be considered revolutionary artists.\n\nIt would be wrong to think that the young poets, who followed the motto of poetism, promoting art as a playful game, unwilling to convert political ideas and revolutionary gestures into poetry, but rather cultivated beautiful words and indulged in beautiful and fantastic images, vibrant with life, which in spite of all the social poverty is so beautiful, ran away from socialism. Our poets, joined in Deve\u02c7tsil, always professed their affiliation to the idea of revolution and managed to prove it by turning poetry into a beautiful play; they have given the proletariat more than proletarian poetry ever could.18\n\nAs mentioned in the previous chapter, following his departure from the leading position in Proletkult, S. K. Neumann established his own magazine, called Reflektor (Spotlight), in which he continued his campaign against Deve\u02c7tsil. In early 1925, Deve\u02c7tsil terminates its collaboration, once so expressly proclaimed, with the Literary Group. The reasons for this move, formulated by Teige and Seifert, were published in the February issue of the P\u00e1smo magazine. In it the authors write that they have left the editorial staff of the common Host magazine because \"during the three months they found out that only the left of this generation, represented by Deve\u02c7tsil, is truly modern, therefore, the working partnership with groups outside Deve\u02c7tsil is delusive and pointless.\"19 On behalf of the Literary Group, J. Goetz rejected these ideological reasons and noted that the main reason was that \"Deve\u02c7tsil needs the illusion that they are in control, that they lead.\"20 The core of the dispute was which of the two groups would have more room to publish. Teige's narrow-mindedness thus thwarted an attempt at creating a generational magazine of young artists.\n\nAnother thing Teige did to prove his talent at getting into disputes with just about anyone was the magazine article \"Dosti Wolkera\" (Enough of Wolker), in which Deve\u02c7tsil protested against the emerging cult of J. Wolker as a national poet. In the article, Deve\u02c7tsil disputed the opinions that following Wolker's death it moved away from the modern style. Teige tries to rebut the notion that Wolker's death represents a symbolic death of revolution. Until then, there was not much that Deve\u02c7tsil could have been reproached for; however, the last part of the article sparked much controversy. It read: \"Enough of Wolker! They say he was the last big bad poet\u2014an ideological one. His death prevented him from becoming a good poet. Today, this story is a source of virtue for the bourgeoisie. Wolker created, plainly and with all naivety, a new kind of humanity, that is why we loved him; however, he did not give rise to a new form. It is only after Wolker that truly new and grand art begins.\"21\n\nThese words outraged members of the Literary Group, which Wolker had left to join Deve\u02c7tsil. \"It is foolish to say that Wolker was the last big, bad, ideological poet. It presupposes that . . . the irrational romanticism of poetism . . . is the only great art of the future. . . . Deve\u02c7tsil does not have the right to throw the bourgeoisie at its opponents, etc. Deve\u02c7tsil itself abandoned proletarian art.\"22 In his article \"Likvidace Wolkerova kultu\" (Doing Away with Wolker's Cult) in the March issue of the Avantgarda magazine, J. Fuc\u02c7\u00edk clearly defined the momentary mood in Deve\u02c7tsil: \"But the revolution did not come, as Seifert had sung . . . and left for Paris to cure his hoarse vocal cords. Wolker remained alone. He took the unbeaten path towards proletarian hearts, while Deve\u02c7tsil members took the traditional path of bourgeois entertainment.\"23 Two years later, B. Mathesius puts Fuc\u02c7\u00edk's observation even more harshly in the article \"Politick\u00e9 hrany\" (\"Political edges\"): \"Proletarian poetry . . . They are twenty years old and they want to die on the barricades, but the revolution is not barricades. It is a long process, spread over a period of a number of years. Seifert's eyes are opening, he doesn't want to die anymore, because even proletarians desire ham, wine, and caviar.\"24 In April of 1925, S. K. Neumann published a very laconic, summarizing conclusion in the Reflektor magazine: \"With Wolker dead, the others, following Karel Teige, their theoreticizing drummer, moved away quickly from the proletariat. The end of proletarian art drew near.\"25\n\nHora continued to defend Deve\u02c7tsil, while Deve\u02c7tsil members themselves fought back against Neumann's criticism in the P\u00e1smo magazine, not from the position of proletarian culture, but rather from the position of those who rejected Neumann's constant moralizing. \"S\u00e1\u0161a [S. K. Neumann], who recently turned fifty, so prolific in the past, gives up on poetism and art for other than artistic problems. Old age, which demurs both the ingenuity as well as shrewdness of the bourgeoisie. . . . Reflektor would benefit from a little more modernness, more small pictures and less moralism, narrow-mindedness and moralizing by the Deve\u02c7tsil generation, which has long ceased to be the 'C\u02c7erven' baby.\"26\n\nThe discussion between Deve\u02c7tsil and Neumann resulted in a debate on the mission of a communist artist. One view, held among others by Neumann, was that artistic work must serve the purpose of promoting communist ideas and play a campaigning role. The opposing view, held primarily by Deve\u02c7tsil, rested in the conviction that an artist's political affiliation cannot be measured against the agitational impact of his work. F. C. Weiskopf expressed this view aptly in his article \"Pryc\u02c7 s karbanictv\u00edm\" (\"Away with Gambling\").\n\nWe cannot expect a poet to exalt in his work the resolutions of some regional conference of the communist party or turn into poetry the editorials of some local communist press. . . . What we can do is to invite him to give up the blissful isolation he enjoys and join us in one big organization of leftist\u2014in the broad sense of the word\u2014art. Let us transform the often slogan-based long-distance discussion to an everlasting discussion and criticism within a new organization of leftist art, both politically and artistically! Long live the united leftist front in art!27\n\nIt was the first mention of a term to be used later to refer to an organization, which would be another attempt at uniting leftist, or if you like, pro-communist artists in Czechoslovakia. V. Nezval supplemented Weiskopf's statement with a definition of the criterion of leftist art. \"Originally, an artist's leftism was decided by his political conviction, later his so-called ductile revolutionism. The only true criterion, it seems to me, is distinct newness and quality.\"28\n\nPoetism as Deve\u02c7tsil's new program and the discussion around it did not result in any particular conclusion; however, it deepened the gap between the young leftist artists and the Communist Party, which in the mid-1920s practically gave up on any kind of cultural activity. The continuity of proletarian culture was thus maintained by the middle-aged generation of writers, mainly by S. K. Neumann. Although Deve\u02c7tsil continued to formally profess communism, its connection with the communist party was purely superficial. Most Deve\u02c7tsil members did not take part in campaigning in favor of the Communist Party and their artwork did not meet the requirements of the department of campaigning and propaganda. In spite of all this, Deve\u02c7tsil considered itself to be a communist organization. The dispute as to whether proletarian art was determined by its form, content, or the author's political affiliation, remained, largely due to the passive approach by the Communist Party, unresolved.\n\nNotes\n\n1.

The symptom of the crisis was to be the diversion of the proletariat from mass events organized by the party; the fault was attributed to the right-leaning leadership of the party, represented by V. Bolen and B. J\u00edlek.1 What is paradoxical is that in 1922 this group was temporarily expelled from the KSC\u02c7 for their ultra-left views.2 This discrepancy not only proves the confusion of communist terminology, which arose mainly in providing reasons for someone's expulsion, or the disposal of \"non-adaptable comrades,\" but also partly answers the question of what the development of the communist movement looked like in the second half of the 1920s not just in Czechoslovakia, but also in most other countries. Thanks to having overcome the postwar crisis and in the stage of economic prosperity, the revolutionary mood among the population gradually cooled off. Members of the party as well its functionaries were exposed to the same process.\n\nNot even at this time does the party's leadership abandon the tactic of the united front; however, reality forces it to proceed more moderately, as corresponds with the climate in society. The refusal to organize mass revolutionary events, which was earlier used as an excuse to expel Bubn\u00edk and other functionaries from the party, becomes quite a common procedure in 1927 and 1928. The Communist International, irritated by such policy, constantly tries to intervene and by modifying the inner workings of the KSC\u02c7 changes the party's \"unrevolutionary passivity.\" The party sees a rise in tension and a not very transparent struggle among several splinter groups or individuals. Following the departure of B. meral and shortly after him also the departure of K. Kreibich to the Moscow headquarters of the Comintern, comrades V. Friedrich and B. Hu\u02dala are expelled from the party after being labeled as Trotskyist and opportunist elements.3 By pressure from J\u00edlek's group, A. Neurath is removed from the party's central committee. Gradually, two major factions start to crystallize. One of them is J\u00edlek's group, backed by a number of artists mainly from the middle-aged generation (Hora, Olbracht, Neumann, etc.), while a certain center of opposition is formed around the Agitprop department (of campaigning and propaganda), led by K. Gottwald from 1926.\n\nJ\u00edlek's leadership gradually gained the upper hand in the Communist Party and assumed most of the decisive competencies. For authors of communist publications on the history of the KSC\u02c7, this was proof of bad leadership; however, neither before 1925, nor after 1929, when J\u00edlek was removed from the Communist Party's leadership, was the process of decision making based on collective decisions of the central committee (although formally it was made to look that way). Quite the contrary, the central committee was fully subordinated to the directives of the Communist International, that is, a narrow group within the party's leadership. In the handbook De\u02c7jiny KSC\u02c7, published in 1966, we can read that\n\nas of the third congress, the party was managed in such a way that the secretariat of the party's central committee, consisting of only a handful of people and led by B. J\u00edlek as Organization Secretary, managed 'in the interest of alleviating the burden of the politburo' even political issues. Gradually, the party's leadership was concentrated in the hands of a very small group. . . .  \nIts consequence was the formal management of the party's affairs and its events, their stereotypical character and the dullness of the party's work.\"4\n\nB. J\u00edlek's position in the Communist Party was also confirmed by the fourth congress of the KSC\u02c7, held from March 25 to 28, 1927. In his speech, J\u00edlek expressed his contentment with the progress of the Bolshevization in the party; on the other hand he criticized the insufficient efforts of the department of campaigning and propaganda. J\u00edlek also managed to fill the position of editor in chief of Rud\u00e9 pr\u00e1vo Evening Paper with I. Olbracht, who was loyal to him. J\u00edlek's leadership was ever more frequently in conflict with the Communist International, which regularly criticized the laxness in organizing mass events directed against the bourgeois republic. However, the activity of the KSC\u02c7 was faced with an obstacle in the form of the previously mentioned consolidation of the economic situation in Czechoslovakia and the resulting weakened interest of the people (including many supporters of the KSC\u02c7) in these events. J\u00edlek rightfully pointed this out; however, Stalin, by means of the Comintern and his supporters in the KSC\u02c7 (mainly Gottwald and Guttman), demanded that the KSC\u02c7 leadership organize mass events at any cost.\n\nThus, under pressure from within as well as from without, J\u00edlek and his supporters gradually found themselves in an indefensible position. At the turn of 1927 and 1928, the Red Trade Unions attempted, in collaboration with representatives of the \"reformist\" trade unions, to organize mass protests against the plan to curtail social insurance, but this effort did not attract the needed mass support. A similar fate awaited the miners' strike, aimed at increasing miners' wages in North Bohemia in February of 1928. Three days later, the strike was called off after an agreement was made between the strikers and the employers. With a view to the public's diversion from mass events, in April of 1928, the KSC\u02c7 leadership withdrew from organizing a general strike to protest against the worsening social standing of the working class. In the spring of 1928 (prior to the sixth congress of the Comintern), especially young members of the Communist Party started to form an opposition against the politics of B. J\u00edlek, criticizing it publicly. \"The opposition was supported by the department of campaigning and propaganda of the central committee, led by Klement Gottwald, as well as some regional organizations and the communist youth movement. The party press, especially the theoretical magazine Komunistick\u00e1 revue (the Communist Revue), played an important role in the fight of these revolutionary groups against opportunism.\"5 Some authors have a tendency to overrate the importance of the Komunistick\u00e1 revue, probably because K. Gottwald published his views in it. The truth is that it was the department of campaigning and propaganda that became the base for the attacks on J\u00edlek.\n\nThe so-called Red Day meant the actual end of J\u00edlek's leadership. To protest against the ban on Spartakiad, the Communist Party called a mass demonstration in Prague for July 6, 1928. However, the authorities were well prepared for the event and managed to crush it at the very beginning.6 The several thousand unorganized supporters of the KSC\u02c7, who arrived at Wenceslas Square, were dispersed. During the event's assessment at the KSC\u02c7 central committee's meeting on July 9 and 10, the opposition, led by K. Gottwald, spoke up against J\u00edlek's leadership. Gottwald criticized J\u00edlek not only for the mistakes in his political as well organizational efforts, but mainly for his strategic and tactical orientation.\n\nBetween July 17 and September 1, 1928, the sixth congress of the Communist International was held in Prague.7 During the congress, a special committee discussed the situation in the Czechoslovak section. The committee emphasized the need for an intraparty debate, which was to be based on the letter of the Executive Committee of the Communist International entitled \"From Opportunist Passivity to Bolshevik Activity.\"8 The International also removed J\u00edlek from the Czechoslovak section's leadership and appointed K. Gottwald to lead the section. Thus, the Comintern did not even attempt to maintain any kind of illusion of the KSC\u02c7's autonomy and itself decided on the changes in the party's leadership. This procedure only shows that the KSC\u02c7, as well as the other sections of the Comintern, were fully subordinated to their Soviet headquarters.\n\nFollowing the publication of the open letter by the Communist International's Executive Committee, a debate on the party's activity was initiated in the KSC\u02c7. The main topic of the discussions was the heavy loss suffered during the Red Day event and its causes, further discussed were the measures necessary to ensure the continuation of Bolshevization, the struggle against opportunists and the question of the party's future leadership. The result of the discussions was known in advance\u2014the former leaders had to be removed and replaced with people from Gottwald's group. This can be proved by an article by K. Reissner entitled \"From Opportunist Passivity to Bolshevik Activity in the Department of Campaigning and Propaganda of the KSC\u02c7,\" published on October 5, 1928 in Rud\u00e9 pr\u00e1vo newspaper and also in the November issue of the Komunistick\u00e1 revue.\n\nThe author claims that \"until the fifth congress of the Communist International, there was no clear understanding in the party of the essence of the campaigning and propagandist work, its methods or organizational forms. Systematic campaigning and propaganda in the central institutions only began in 1925. The heritage left to J\u00edlek's central committee, called upon to fight against the real threat within the KSC\u02c7, was undoubtedly not too great.\"9 According to the author, J\u00edlek's leadership not only failed to improve the situation during the previous three years, but further worsened it. The height of his incompetence, as the author puts it, was the failure of the Red Day. On the other hand, the author claims that Agitprop (the department of campaigning and propaganda), led by K. Gottwald, sets a good example of good propagandistic work.\n\nJ\u00edlek attempted to defend himself by pointing out that no one else could have elicited revolutionary enthusiasm, as nobody was interested in it. He also criticized the functionaries appointed to the party's leadership by Stalin. \"The department of Agitprop was led by . . . a member of the opposition group, comrade Gottwald, and so he should be the first to bear responsibility for the insufficient ideological preparation of the party's members.\"10 The roles of individual groups were to be defined by the upcoming fifth congress of the KSC\u02c7; however, this was only wishful thinking on J\u00edlek's behalf (details in the following chapter).\n\nLeftist Culture between 1926 and 1928\n\nSimilarly as in political feuds, on the cultural field in the period between 1926 and 1928 the enthusiasm of a larger part of the cultural workers affiliated with the Communist Party was also on the wane. This trend was partially described in the previous chapter. In this subchapter I will only marginally mention several events and statements that are typical of the development in the leftist cultural community at that time. First I will cover an interesting event, which led to what later befell the Communist Party and the leftist cultural community.11 The event was so-called Causa Vanc\u02c7ura (Vanc\u02c7ura's case), played out on the pages of the left-oriented cultural press in 1926.\n\nVladislav Vanc\u02c7ura, the first chairman of the Deve\u02c7tsil Art Association, came up with an interesting idea in the Tvorba (Creation) magazine, run by Franti\u0161ek Xaver alda, in connection with the factional disputes within the Communist Party. In his article, entitled \"Against the Secretaries of My Party,\" Vanc\u02c7ura called himself an idealist communist, who is not bound by the instructions and decisions of KSC\u02c7 leaders, no matter their contents. Further, he stated that \"all cultural blunders and damage can be attributed to the virtue of the Secretariat.\"12\n\nF. C. Weiskopf responded to Vanc\u02c7ura's article in the communist students' magazine Avantgarda.13 In his article \"In All Directions,\" he generalizes the case of the disagreement of one person with the policies of KSC\u02c7 leadership to a more general issue of the relationship between an artist and communism. According to Weiskopf,\n\nwe cannot expect that\u2014at least during the era of the transition from capitalism to collectivism\u2014the antagonism between collectivity and an artist's individuality was done away with. The development of the new revolutionary art will walk the path of 'struggle' between the individualism of an artist and collective society; between a more or less anarchist artist and the bearer of the idea of collectivism, i.e. a member and the tightly organized vanguard of the proletariat. However, that does not mean that the vanguard organization (communist party) shall by some kind of mechanism interfere with this development. No! What it means is that a left-leaning artist's development and artistic production will be affected also by his individual efforts, as well as the efforts of the struggling proletarian vanguard, which he belongs to. His path will therefore be the resultant of these two forces.14\n\nWeiskopf does not condemn Vanc\u02c7ura, yet at the same time, he believes Vanc\u02c7ura's critical view of the developments in the Communist Party is caused by the fact that he is an artist. Such \"presumption of guilt\" of an artist or an intellectual is quite typical of the communist mentality and doctrine, as has already been shown in the previous chapters, and as will be emphasized in the following chapters.\n\nAnother paradigmatic example of the skeptical communist view of the role of the intelligentsia in world revolution can be found in Z\u00e1vi\u0161 Kalandra's article \"The Problem of Intelligentsia and Kostufra\" in the same issue of the Avantgarda magazine. According to Kalandra, Kostufra (Communist Students' Faction) must give up on winning students over to the idea of revolution, as it is the task of the proletariat. \"Kostufra's goals have always been more modest, but all the more reachable and, most importantly, more practically valuable: \"we are trying to neutralize the masses of students so that they would not stand up against the proletariat at the time of revolution.\"15 The young communist intelligentsia thus gives up on taking part in the revolution, and consequently also on the effort to gain positions in the Communist Party.\n\nThe development of the culture of the left in the period between 1926 and 1928 continued in the spirit of ever stronger diversion of leftist artists from revolutionary rhetoric and disputes between the young and middle-aged generations over the form of revolutionary or modern art. F. X. alda attempted to overcome the generation gap by establishing the previously mentioned magazine Tvorba, where representatives of all artistic movements of the left could publish. Also the Fronta anthology, edited by Franti\u0161ek Halas, Bedr\u02c7ich V\u00e1clavek, and others, was run in the same spirit. In 1927, the Fronta anthology turned into the Fronta magazine. In its first issue, especially representatives of the young generation of artists (among others, J. tyrsk\u00fd, Toyen, V. Nezval, J. Honzl, and others) embrace the idea of social revolution and communism. At the same time, they proclaim the necessity to separate modern art from all \"-isms,\" which only cause its haziness. The main goal they set for themselves was to revolutionize culture and join it with political revolution.16\n\nIn mid-1927 another round of discussions starts on poetism, that is, Deve\u02c7tsil. In the June issue of the Tvorba magazine, J. Hora publishes an article, \"The Future of Poetism,\" in which he writes: \"Proletarian poetry as a literary style died for many reasons other than literary ones. Poetism in our country starts exactly at the time when the wave of social revolutionism in Western Europe is subsiding and communism is becoming a socio-political method, a way to a slow, patient organization of the masses.\"17 According to Hora, poetism is merely a thing of the past, only a layover designed by Teige.\n\nK. Teige expresses disagreement with this opinion and in the newly established Revue Deve\u02c7tsilu magazine shows that it was in 1927 that thus far the best works of art were created by Deve\u02c7tsil members professing pietism.18 According to Teige, it was Revue Deve\u02c7tsilu (further referred to as ReD), whose first issue came out in October 1927, which proves the viability of the idea of poetism. \"ReD intends to become a synthetic magazine of international modern art. . . . The positions of ReD are those of the Association of Modern Culture 'Deve\u02c7tsil,' which the ReD magazine belongs to. ReD shall be a sample book and an anthology of pietism.\"19\n\nHowever, it soon became clear that the magazine was a purely artistic revue, which restrained itself from commenting on political issues. The magazine's second issue featured an article entitled \"Ten Years of Soviet Culture,\" which says that \"all significant achievements of modern Russian culture originated in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, not in counter-revolutionary emigration\u2014and it certainly is not a historical coincidence that the major growth of Russian cultural work started with the October revolution in 1917;\"20 other than that, the authors focus mainly on art.\n\nReD gained a partly political character in mid-1928, when it ran two of J. Fuc\u02c7\u00edk's articles against K. C\u02c7apek and F. Peroutka, that is, people who developed theories rejecting the communist ideas. In its June issue, Teige publishes an article, \"Manifesto of Poetism.\" He claims that \"poetism was meant as a new esthetic and philosophical view, as a confession before the end of the millennium\"21 and continues by recapitulating the development of the culture of the left after WWI.\n\nThe generation of artists that was born during the war, influenced by the social upheaval and stirred to fight against the old world and for new orders, lived by the motto \"proletarian art,\" which promoted turning away from the sentimentality of private erotic and ethical crises, from expressionist decadence and from esthetic confessionalism and exhibitionism, the abandonment of subjectivism and the merger of the new class-conscious reality with typical and collective life forms. \"Proletarian art\" lacked the time to create its new forms and its own systems, it fossilized in its naive rhetoric and forgot about itself in the whirl of class struggle. Dissatisfied by the alarm of this \"proletarian art,\" we attempted to revise its program and explain things from the Marxist point of view. Ever more often it showed that the program of proletarian art was a completely false and insufficient solution, an incorrect answer to the questions of the revolutionary era. We have learned that proletarian art, as preached by Lunacharsky, is a non-Marxist delusion22 and esthetic nonsense. Even poems whose intention was to campaign for the revolutionary movement turned out to be not only insufficient poems, but also a very bad campaigning tool.23\n\nIn mid-1928, the situation in the area of leftist art is similar to that in the communist party. There are several groups, each with its own concept of proletarian art. While the old and middle-aged generation of artists (Neumann, Hora, and others) still interprets it as art for the proletariat and produced by \"intellectual proletarians,\" the group around K. Teige uses the term proletarian art rather loosely and suggests that only now do its members produce genuine proletarian art, based on real artistic quality, although incomprehensible to the proletariat itself. According to Teige and others, the proletarian character of this art is ensured by the artists' proclamation of support for the Communist Party. Apart from these two most exposed groups, there are others, of whose proletarianness, especially in the Communist Party, there can be no doubt. These are mainly people associated with the Association of Literary and Graphic Artists,24 whose art is not only sufficiently comprehensible, but what's more, also serves very well the purpose of political agitation.\n\nIn the second half of 1928, the Communist Party undergoes an ideological split and during this time does not deal with its cultural policy. The party's Bolshevization, orchestrated by Stalin and the Communist International, was such a turbulent process that culture, as many times before, was considered the least of the party's priorities.\n\nNotes\n\n1.

J\u00edlek and his followers from leading positions in the Communist Party and their replacement with mostly very young Bolsheviks, completely loyal to Stalin, caused a large-scale discussion within the Communist Party as well as in the party press not only on the party's past, but also on the agenda of the upcoming fifth congress of the KSC\u02c7 and the future of the communist movement in Czechoslovakia. The majority of artists who supported the Communist Party and who often worked in the communist periodicals sided with B. J\u00edlek (for example, J. Hora, M. Majerov\u00e1, J. Seifert, etc.). On the other hand, Gottwald's group published their views mainly in the theoretical magazine Komunistick\u00e1 revue.\n\nThe dominance of Gottwald's group, whose members replaced some of J\u00edlek's supporters, was shown at the meeting of the KSC\u02c7 central committee in December of 1928. J\u00edlek remained a member of the central committee as it was necessary to formally keep him \"in power\" in order to give the notion of a standard, \"democratic\" change of leadership. KSC\u02c7 leadership, already dominated by the Bolsheviks, decided to postpone the fifth congress and thus extend the so-called intraparty discussion by another two months. During this time, regional conferences of the KSC\u02c7 were held, at which the support of Bolshevization was discussed and voted on. The information on the support of the political line of the sixth congress of the Communist International, that is, the Gottwald group, is rather inconsistent. For example, V. C\u02c7ada states that \"in most cases, the regional conferences of the KSC\u02c7 concluded with the victory of the Marxist-Leninist movement.\"1 Other publications claim that in all eighteen regional organizations, Gottwald's group gained the support of more than 90 percent of delegates.2 It is likely that similarly as during the fifth congress of the KSC\u02c7, this coverage was also often manipulated.\n\nIn the January issue of the Komunistick\u00e1 revue, Gottwald publishes an article entitled \"On the Fifth Congress of the KSC\u02c7,\" in which he searches for the reasons of the weakening communist influence. \"Reformism . . . in our country represents a strong social and political force and especially most recently has been gaining in strength. The reasons for its growth are objective on the one hand ('positive' aspects of the reconstruction period), and on the other hand, there are subjective reasons (passivity of the communist party).\"3 Apart from the potential resistance of J\u00edlek's group and the strengthening of revolutionary activity, Gottwald sees the main danger for the KSC\u02c7 in the so-called reformist parties, that is, Social Democracy and the National Socialist Party.\n\nIn the same issue of the Komunistick\u00e1 revue, P. Reimann comments on the issues on the agenda of the fifth congress of the KSC\u02c7. In his opinion, the congress should direct its program against social democracy and Masarykism. \"These views are in irreconcilable contradiction with communism. Both the ideology of Masarykism and the social democratic ideology are concepts of maintaining and developing the bourgeois social order. . . . These movements, which are very close to each other, have nothing in common with socialism.\"4 In his article \"What Do We Do Now,\" J. Guttmann further complements Reimann: \"The former leadership lacked any kind of strategic plan. S. J\u00edlek fervently defended himself against this accusation, which his opponents presented in Moscow both in the delegation and the Czechoslovak commission, until the very end (including his closing speech before the commission).\"5\n\nThe fifth congress of the KSC\u02c7 was held from February 18 to 23, 1929. What speaks of the transition of power within the party is that the opening address was not presented by J\u00edlek, who was still \"in power,\" but Gottwald, appointed by Stalin. J\u00edlek's role at the congress was that of a quixotic scapegoat, who unsuccessfully attempted to defend the legitimacy of his reservations to the Comintern's program for its Czechoslovak section. Five out of seven speeches were given by the Bolshevik opposition (Gottwald, Guttmann, Sl\u00e1nsk\u00fd, Reimann, Fried) and only two by the existing leadership (J\u00edlek and Stern).\n\nIn his opening speech, Gottwald accused J\u00edlek's leadership of opportunism and social democratism. Among other things, he reproached him for preaching solidarity between classes, which damaged the interests of the proletariat. Gottwald emphasized the role of mass strikes and stated that the only solution to the intraparty crisis was to gain power and establish the dictatorship of the proletariat. He also accented the role of the Red Trade Unions in recruiting new supporters of the Communist Party.6 He also encouraged the communist factions in noncommunist trade unions to intensify their activity.\n\nIn order to ensure the victory of the course of the Communist International, the congress was manipulated in various ways. The meetings were held in a different place every day and \"reliable\" confidants told \"reliable\" delegates only in the morning where the meetings were going to take place. Thus, the anti-Gottwald wing was practically excluded from the meetings. The new central committee was elected en bloc and according to the proceedings, it (just as with all other provisions) was approved unanimously. In spite of all this effort, the takeover of power did not go entirely smoothly. The intraparty opposition came forward on two main political fronts.\n\nImmediately after seizing power in the KSC\u02c7, Gottwald's leadership also intended to take control of the press and of various satellite communist organizations. The first test of the strength of the new party leadership was taking over the International All-Union League, whose leaders remained loyal to J\u00edlek's group and postponed their congress, which prevented the Stalinists from staging a coup, as they did at the fifth congress of the KSC\u02c7, and taking over the leadership as well as the organization's considerable resources. Thus, the Stalinists were forced to convoke a parallel congress on May 4 and 5, similar to that held by social democracy in 1920. The third All-Union congress (of the Red Trade Unions), which \"elected\" its new leadership, also meant the collapse of the International All-Union League. Approximately 90,000 of its members were transferred to the Red Trade Unions, controlled by the communists, while the remaining 75,000 joined the Czechoslovak Social Democratic Trade Union in 1930.\n\nAnother major opposition which formed in the KSC\u02c7 against Gottwald's leadership were the so-called Leninists. These were twenty-six7 communist members of parliament and senators, led by B. J\u00edlek, V. Bolen, and A. Neurath, who on March 27 published the Proclamation of Twenty-six Against the Decisions of the fifth Congress of the KSC\u02c7. The signatories of the Proclamation, written by Bolen, criticize the coup in the KSC\u02c7, the politics of the Communist International as well as Stalin himself.8 On April 9, these members of parliament and senators established their own parliamentary club. Before long, in early June 1929 (June 1 and 2 to be precise), all of its members were expelled from the KSC\u02c7.\n\nThe way the new communist party leadership dealt with its opposition was a reflection of its political course. A long time always passed between the appearance of the \"dissenters\" and the counteraction against them. During this time, a meeting of the presidium of the Communist International's executive committee took place, which then encouraged the dissenters to admit their mistake and support the new leadership, and instructions were issued (not publicly) on how the opposition was to be subdued in order to quickly resolve the difficult situation.\n\nFollowing the fifth congress of the Communist Party, opponents of the new leadership of the KSC\u02c7 lost access to the party press; therefore, in May of 1929 they renewed the Komunista (Communist) magazine, formerly published by A. Muna and closed down in 1921, which was to become the magazine of the communist opposition. In its first issue, O. E. Berger explains the reasons for the revival of the Komunista magazine.\n\nOur political program is Marxism and Leninism; however, these have long been abandoned by the official party leadership, only to be replaced by anarcho-syndicalism and romantic, self-proclaimed ultra-leftism. . . . If we had not been sure of our cause and if we had not been convinced that the development of both international as well as domestic politics would one day prove that we were right, had we not been sure that we were obligated to do so in the interest of the proletariat and particularly for the sake of the Russian revolution\u2014we would not have formed an opposition.9\n\nFrom its early existence, the opposition attempted to surround itself with members and organizations of the KSC\u02c7 that did not agree with the trend set by the fifth congress of the KSC\u02c710 and encouraged them to put up resistance to the new leadership, which in Muna's opinion introduced a nondemocratic form of governance in the party. \"The party sees the introduction of a regime of a complete dictatorship of students, who seized power unprepared and incompetent, and whoever does not succumb to their dictate will be driven out of the party, expelled or, disgusted, will voluntarily withdraw from the party. . . . Comrades! Our old friends: Let us get back to work to save the party that we all love, for which we fought, made sacrifices for and which must remain our party, a party of honest revolutionary workers. Away with the dictatorship of students with bourgeois roots.\"11 The impression one gets from reading the article is that the \"old and worthy\" communists did not care about the party any more. What is interesting is the reference to the class roots of the new leadership, which points out an important attribute of Bolshevization. The leadership was taken over by trained apparatchiks and publicists, who did have \"proletarian roots;\" however, they never made a living as laborers (this phenomenon will be dealt with in more detail in the next subchapter).\n\nThe Leninists rejected their expulsion from the Communist Party and called the imperial conference of the opposition in the KSC\u02c7 for June 29 and 30, which labeled the situation in the Communist Party as a profound crisis. Among others, the assessment of its causes includes: \"Objectively, what is at play here is the process of the stabilization of capitalism, which gives the proletariat all kinds of illusions. Subjectively, there are various influences of the leaders and the role of their politics. . . . The politics of the current leadership of the communist party is erroneous and wrong. Its general course leads from the mass party to a sect, from Lenin's principles of class struggle tactics to politically adventurous anarcho-radicalism, to the politics of suicidal hazard, the self-destruction of hard-earned positions among the proletariat and on the revolutionary front against the bourgeoisie.\" The Communist International was not spared criticism either:\n\nas a result of the faction struggle within the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and as a consequence of the natural disagreement and difficulties resulting from the increasing stabilization of capitalism and the development of socialism, it initiated the wrong, ultraleft course on an international scale, forcing its individual sections into its implementation. This was combined with the bureaucratic, anti-Leninist course of the party, eliminating the fundamental principles of intraparty democracy and expelling from the party essential ideological debate and the healthy flow of ideas.12\n\nOn the one hand, the conference openly supported the continuity of the Communist Party, but on the other hand it elected its own thirty-member imperial committee, from which a smaller committee was selected to be in charge of the operative tasks.13 The conference also expressed its disagreement with the increase in membership fees, ordered by Gottwald's leadership in June of 1929, and started issuing its own membership cards and stamps.\n\nIf we put the efforts of the people around the Komunista magazine in the international context of the communist movement, we can view the group as an opposition of the emerging cult of J. Stalin. To this fact also speak the protests against the expulsion of Bukharin from the Comintern's Executive Committee, comparing it to the removal of Trotsky; they also predict very accurately that Bukharin will face the same fate as Trotsky. However, the opposition did not manage to find sufficient support for its program in the KSC\u02c7, which was caused mainly by the opposition's inability to spread its views among other party members by means of the party press. Members of the opposition were removed from the main communist periodicals (Rud\u00e9 pr\u00e1vo/Red Law, Rovnost/Equality, and others), and the Komunista magazine was never read on a mass scale.14 Moreover, the opposition faced a lack of financial resources, which meant the Komunista magazine soon closed down; its last, twenty-seventh issue came out on October 24, 1929. However, before then, the opposition proved that it cared about the future of the party by calling on its supporters to vote for the KSC\u02c7 in the preliminary parliamentary election. \"Of course, this does not mean that we endorse the wrong course of the party's leadership and those representing it.\"15\n\nIn 1930, most members of the opposition realized that their position in the party and the communist movement in Czechoslovakia was weak, and returned (together with the splintered part of the International All-Union League) to the Social Democratic Party, which it had left in 1920. What undoubtedly contributed to this decision was the fact that all opposition members of parliament and senators lost their mandates in the parliamentary election.\n\nThe parliamentary election in October of 1929 was supposed to demonstrate the real power of the Communist Party. Compared to 1925, the KSC\u02c7 lost 180,000 voters, its election results dropped to 10.2 percent of cast votes (the worst election results in the history of the KSC\u02c7/Communist Party in the Czech Lands). On the one hand, the election results confirmed the decrease in popularity of KSC\u02c7 among the population, but on the other hand, they showed that the Bolshevik leadership was supported by a considerable number of not only party members, but also other supporters. The parliamentary election also dealt with the problem of \"Leninists,\" which further strengthened Gottwald's leadership within the party. For the first time, Gottwald became a member of parliament; this enabled him to step up his propaganda, which he had already mastered as head of the department of campaigning and propaganda.\n\nProclamation of Seven Writers\n\nThe third group which stood up against the changes in the leadership of the KSC\u02c7 was the group of communist writers. Although it was the least numerous group and had virtually no significant influence in the party, its views received the most publicity.\n\nIn reaction to the results of the fifth congress of the KSC\u02c7, seven communist writers signed and published an open letter called \"Communist Writers to Communist Workers.\" Among other things, it reads:\n\nKSC\u02c7 is in a state of crisis, which threatens to destroy it as a fighting workers' party. . . . The indifference of its members to the party's events is on the increase, there is strife within the party that is substantiated neither by the profit of the party, nor the benefit of the working class, but flows from the mistakes made by comrades who in utter misunderstanding of the nature of the proletariat as well as the overall situation, lead the Czechoslovak proletariat into the politics of purely factional hazard, which can only end in the destruction of the mass character of the KSC\u02c7 and the weakening of the offensive power of the proletariat in our state. . . . We cannot keep quiet about the suicidal politics of incompetent roaring words and division at any cost. . . . Workers . . . take the initiative, demand rectification! Let there be an extraordinary congress of the party, which for the sake of the unity does away with the dispute of the trade union organizations, and may the party's leadership be taken over by those communists who want to work towards a party united, a party of the masses. . . . The Communist party is in danger, comrades! Never before has it been in a bigger one.16\n\nThe open letter was signed by Josef Hora, Marie Majerov\u00e1, Helena Mal\u00edr\u02c7ov\u00e1, Stanislav Kostka Neumann, Ivan Olbracht, Jaroslav Seifert, and Vladislav Vanc\u02c7ura. Examining their ties with the Communist Party, we learn that most of them worked in various press organizations of the KSC\u02c7. I. Olbracht was editor-in-chief of Rud\u00e9 pr\u00e1vo Evening Paper, in which J. Hora was in charge of the culture section; H. Mal\u00edr\u02c7ov\u00e1 was responsible for the women's sections in both Rud\u00e9 pr\u00e1vo as well as its Evening Paper, while M. Majerov\u00e1 was similarly in charge of the children's sections; J. Seifert worked as an editor at the Communist Publishing House. S. K. Neumann also had close ties with the communist press. Only V. Vanc\u02c7ura, who\u2014as stated above\u2014stood up against the frequent changes in the leadership of the KSC\u02c7 and the tactics of the communist movement's political activity as early as at the turn of 1925 and 1926, was not a communist journalist.\n\nThe proclamation, which was not published in the communist press and apart from being run in the Lidov\u00e9 noviny paper, was circulated around Prague in the form of leaflets,17 is not explicitly clear as to whether it is directed against the new leadership of the KSC\u02c7, or in favor of the old establishment. It did not originate immediately after the fifth congress of the KSC\u02c7, which would otherwise provide a clear context. The writers' primary concern was the dissension inside the KSC\u02c7 and its satellite organizations, particularly the International All-Union League. The letter contains numerous parallels that refer to specific individuals involved in the dissension. The writers accuse the KSC\u02c7 of \"factional terrorism and immature fanaticism, which turns the proletariat into guinea pigs of paper revolutionism.\" The immature fanaticism undoubtedly refers to Gottwald's leadership, nicknamed the \"Karl\u00edn boys.\" The writers also accuse the party leadership of \"incompetent megalomania, which has completely alienated itself from Lenin's teachings and the true spirit of Leninism.\" There is no proof that the open letter was drafted by I. Olbracht on the orders of B. J\u00edlek, for whom he often wrote speeches, although its authorship is often attributed to him. For example, F. Hele\u0161ic claims that Olbracht is considered to be the initiator of the open letter, because \"in Rud\u00e9 pr\u00e1vo paper and in its evening edition, he supported their (J\u00edlek's group) politics even at a time when J\u00edlek, Bolen, and others were from 1922 to 1924 stripped of their leading positions in the party.\"18\n\nRud\u00e9 pr\u00e1vo paper responded to the writers' manifesto with an extensive article entitled \"Projev sedmi\" (\"Manifesto of the Seven\"). First, the writers were condemned from the point of view of their party discipline:\n\nEach member of the communist party has a right to express his opinions within the party, in their local organization, at conferences and congresses. Each party member can turn to the central committee of the communist party with their proclamations, and if need be, even to the highest authority of the world communist movement, the Communist International. . . . No member of the party, whether a famous writer or an ordinary worker, is allowed to oppose the party before the bourgeois public.19\n\nApart from the threats of harsh consequences, the signatories were labeled opportunists of J\u00edlek and Bolen's character20 and the article concludes with a summary, whom to fight against: \"Bourgeoisie is forgetting one thing: the communist party and the revolutionary movement are not built up on the basis of the party's secretaries, members of parliament, senators or writers. The communist party is made up of the revolutionary proletariat.\"21\n\nThe crackdown on the writers was carried out immediately. Those who worked for the Communist Publishing House or the communist press were dismissed from their positions. On March 26, at a meeting of the KSC\u02c7 central committee, Seifert, Olbracht, Hora, Mal\u00edr\u02c7ov\u00e1, and Majerov\u00e1 refused to take back their signature on the proclamation. Subsequently, all the signatories were expelled from the KSC\u02c7. The heaviest caliber the party used against the rebels was issuing a counter statement by their artist colleagues and friends called \"The Essential Position on the Proclamation of the 'Seven,'\" published in the Tvorba magazine on March 30, 1929.\n\nAmong other things, the counterstatement read:\n\nToday, when we clearly see its rising revolutionary energy [of the KSC\u02c7]; today, when it finally finds the strength to rid itself of everything unprincipled; it is today that seven writers, seven of our friends stand where they should never have stood: against the revolutionary democratic organization. No matter how we may try to interpret their move . . . we cannot see it as anything else but a big mistake . . . as a threat to modern art production. They did not just overstep the limit of their competence, they also stepped away from the line that we all have to follow if we do not want to betray the entrusted task, and therefore we issue this statement\u2014not in order to correct their mistake\u2014but to make it clear that our paths have parted.22\n\nThe counterstatement was signed by twelve young artists and literary critics, mostly Deve\u02c7tsil members; namely K. Teige, V. Nezval, F. Halas, K. Konr\u00e1d, L. Novomesk\u00fd, V. Clementis, B. V\u00e1clavek, J. Weil, J. Fuc\u02c7\u00edk, V. Tittelbach, K. Biebl, and V. Z\u00e1vada.23\n\nThe Davist\u00e9 (from magazine Dav\u2014Crowd) movement also came out with a similar denouncement in the article \"V\u00e1m, padl\u00fdm na ducha barik\u00e1d\" (\"For You, the Fallen of the Spirit of the Barricades\"). \"At a time most critical for the proletariat, they lost their balance and joined the front that is in the way of revolutionary progress.\" The strongest criticism is directed against Olbracht, \"who must be all the more harshly condemned, as his is the act of a party politician rather than of a disoriented man of letters.\"24\n\nThe \"division\" within the leftist cultural community can be assessed from several vantage points. The first may be the generational point of view. Of the seven writers, only J. Seifert and V. Vanc\u02c7ura belonged to the Deve\u02c7tsil generation, who encountered Marxism only after WWI, that is, during the time of the communist movement's activity and in the revolutionary postwar wave. The remaining five, who can be said to belong to the middle-aged generation of artists, pressed the ideas of social reform earlier. It was with a great deal of suspicion that S. K. Neumann viewed the young generation of leftist artists associated with Deve\u02c7tsil when they embraced communism. He never concealed the fact that he never considered the works of the Deve\u02c7tsil members to be proletarian art.\n\nAnother dimension of the generation problem corresponds with the age of the members of the new KSC\u02c7 central committee. On average, members of the new leadership were slightly over thirty years of age. Writers of the middle-aged generation were ideologically closer to the former leadership than to the Gottwald \"predators,\" who were conducting a shakedown in the party, aimed especially at the middle-aged and older generation, which in 1921 transformed the left wing of social democracy into a communist party. It was S. K. Neumann who was personally involved in the transformation process. Throughout the 1920s, Neumann's concept faced opposition from Deve\u02c7tsil, especially from its theoretical and ideological spokesperson and leader, K. Teige.\n\nAnd it was K. Teige who took to defending the processes taking place in the KSC\u02c7 as correct. Surprisingly, he was not opposed by S. K. Neumann, but Josef Hora. Rud\u00e9 pr\u00e1vo newspaper initiated the discussion, when it started a political campaign against the \"renegades.\" Following the \"Proclamation of the Seven,\" an article entitled \"Those Who Left\" was published, which brought \"facts\" on how the seven writers maintained contact with party members. The article comments that all seven signatories were virtually inactive in the party, and therefore they have no right to criticize what is happening in the KSC\u02c7. \"Ivan Olbracht has not attended a single public or a members' meeting since 1925. . . . Marie Majerov\u00e1 has not been to a political meeting for years. Jaroslav Seifert, who can hardly be accused of understanding politics, did not attend meetings at all. . . . S. K. Neumann and V. Vanc\u02c7ura have long shut themselves out of any of the party's activities.\" The accusation against the writers for their alleged inactivity was not completely groundless, considering that they were, with a few exceptions, employed in the press institutions of the KSC\u02c7. As a pretext for further attacks, Rud\u00e9 pr\u00e1vo paper took advantage of the fact that those who made a living writing newspapers, took jobs working for the social democratic and national socialist newspapers (Hora, Seifert). They were later labeled as social fascists.\n\nObjectively speaking, it needs to be said that the wording of the \"Proclamation of the Seven\" was rather unfortunate. On the one hand, it was too general, which allowed its critics to also base their counterattack on a similarly general foundation. Moreover, the group of seven was too heterogeneous, as were the motives for signing the proclamation.25 Considering the future of the Communist Party, the gravest motive was stated, though much later, by S. K. Neumann. Supposedly, Neumann was afraid that the KSC\u02c7 was beginning to find itself in a critical situation, where it was losing its mass character and influence on the proletariat.26 This opinion, if indeed it was his motive,27 was not too far from reality. The popularity of the KSC\u02c7 continued to drop. It was written that the constituent congress of the KSC\u02c7 was already being held in the shadows of the failed attempt at a socialist revolution in the second half of 1920. At the time of its constituent congress, the KSC\u02c7 had 360,000 members, at the time of the third regular congress in 1925 the KSC\u02c7 membership numbered only 93,000 and at the time of the fifth congress in 1929, there were only 25,000 members of the KSC\u02c7.\n\nThe early parliamentary election in October 1929 was to become the barometer for the opinions of the left-leaning public on the events in the KSC\u02c7. The election results confirmed Neumann's concern that the dispute within the Communist Party could mean a loss of public support. However, as has already been said, the decrease in the number of voters was not as dramatic as Neumann, Muna, and others had anticipated.\n\nChanges in the Communist Press\n\nThe writers, who at the same time worked as journalists in communist newspapers and magazines, were dismissed from their jobs immediately after their proclamation against the new KSC\u02c7 leadership. The party press was considered as playing a crucial role and therefore the new leaders tried to find entirely loyal journalists as their replacements. The chairman of the party, K. Gottwald, had himself worked as a journalist practically during the entire existence of the party, just as other members of the new establishment\u2014Josef Guttmann, Jan verma, and V\u00e1clav Kopeck\u00fd. Already in 1923, Gottwald wrote: \"The party must use its best people to organize and lead the press, for the party is as good as its press.\"28\n\nFollowing his arrival in Prague in 1926, when he became head of the department of campaigning and propagation, Gottwald surrounded himself with a group of people who identified themselves with the ideas of Bolshevization, especially by complete loyalty to the Communist International. The group consisted almost exclusively of new members of the Communist Party, who had no ties to the party's social democratic past, coming from the Communist Youth Union, or Kostufra. It is this group that after the fifth congress takes the leading positions in the communist press. Among others, the leading positions were filled by Julius Fuc\u02c7\u00edk, Z\u00e1vi\u0161 Kalandra, Ladislav Novomesk\u00fd, Jo\u017eka Jabu\u02darkov\u00e1, and others.\n\nThe party leaders maintain their decisive power in managing the press. From October of 1930, Gottwald was the political director of Rud\u00e9 pr\u00e1vo paper and following the removal of the ultraleft E. Fried, J. Guttmann took over the role of managing the personnel issues and management of the department of campaigning and propagation. Gottwald insisted that the leading functionaries of the party had to take part in creating the party press. \"While the organizational apparatus affects only a small number of the proletariat, the press speaks and gives directives to the masses.\"29 Thus, campaigning and promoting becomes the main activity in the job description of the Communist Party leaders. \"The Politburo, the secretariat or the department of campaigning and propagation actively interfered with the activity as well as the contents of Rud\u00e9 pr\u00e1vo paper and other party periodicals. They decided on the authors of the editorials, the topics of articles and commentaries, the events the press was to organize, . . . any changes in the personnel structure of the editorial staff.\"30\n\nAfter overcoming the disputes in the Communist Party, its leaders further moved to reorganize the press institutions. In the name of centralization, or for the sake of better supervision of the contents of the press, tens of local communist papers and magazines were closed down and ordered to merge with the regional institutions. This move ensured content unification of the communist press. \"Crucial political articles, or the printed speeches from congresses, conferences, the parliament, the senate, or public meetings, were mostly those by Klement Gottwald and other leading functionaries of the party, the red trade unions, and mass organizations.\"31\n\nCultural sections of the party press were also fully subordinated to the supervision of the party's leadership. J. Fuc\u02c7\u00edk was put in charge of the cultural section of Rud\u00e9 pr\u00e1vo paper, while its literary insert was led by L. Novomesk\u00fd. It was Fuc\u02c7\u00edk who pushed the idea that until 1929 the communist press was tendentiously oriented toward the proletariat and had forgotten about promoting leftist culture. In his opinion, KSC\u02c7 has a clear and specific goal, which is to win the intelligentsia over for the cause of proletarian revolution. According to Fuc\u02c7\u00edk, the target group which the campaign of the communist press was to focus on was supposed to be the intelligentsia, whose only choice was either fascism or communism.\n\nIn the analysis of the reorganization of the communist press, we need to mention the renewal of the Komunistick\u00e1 revue in October of 1930.32 As its main goal, the Komunistick\u00e1 revue sets out to study the \"lessons learned\" from the crisis in the Communist Party. From the magazine's first issue, J. Guttmann begins to publish an analysis of the events in the Czechoslovak communist movement from 1918. This analysis critically assesses all stages in the development of the KSC\u02c7 as well as all its participants, with the exception of the new leadership headed by Gottwald. \"The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia has little experience with direct revolutionary struggle. The lesson from 1920 should have been all the more analyzed a long time ago. . . . Opportunist establishments led by meral, Neurath and J\u00edlek were not in favor of such analysis. Firstly, they underestimated the importance of theoretical work; secondly, they were afraid that a critical analysis would make the glory of the party leaders fade significantly.\"33\n\nIn a short period of time, the new Bolshevik leadership of the KSC\u02c7 managed to subordinate the party press to its complete supervision. New editors modified their articles, mostly reports, based on the instructions and requirements of the party's department of campaigning and propagation. \"Editorial work . . . was important political work. It wasn't about any kind of writing, but such that would correspond to the party's political course and the communist conviction of its editors.\"34 On the one hand, the party's cultural politics was mentioned as an important part of the process of Bolshevization; however, on the other hand, the party's leadership did not want to risk another failure like that of Proletkult. The party attempted, on the basis of collaboration with mainly young artists who supported the new leadership, to build up a cultural organization which would be completely controlled by the KSC\u02c7. Thus, Lev\u00e1 fronta (Left Front), to which the next chapter is devoted, came into existence.\n\nNotes\n\n1.

The previous chapter dealt with the so-called \"Proclamation of the Seven\" in terms of this group's conflict with the new KSC\u02c7 leadership. The party press led a denunciative campaign against the \"renegades\"; the central committee of the KSC\u02c7 expelled them from the party and their artist \"comrades\" officially distanced themselves from the group. While expelled trade unionists and members of parliament usually wound up in social democracy, the seven writers did not share their fate. Further development of these seven writers, of which we will focus on J. Hora and S. K. Neumann the most,1 will help us illustrate and evaluate the procedure of cultural propagation at the time of the so-called generation debate, which took place roughly in the period between the fifth and sixth congress of the KSC\u02c7.\n\nFirst of all, it needs to be said that Josef Hora was the only signatory of the \"Proclamation of the Seven,\" who afterward never became closely affiliated with the Communist Party. He became the target of unscrupulous propaganda waged by the KSC\u02c7, namely through Karel Teige. However, Hora was not merely a passive target who would not defend himself. Quite the contrary, he managed to retaliate and even matched Teige's masterly eloquence, proof of which are the articles \"The Writer and Politics\" and \"Literature and Politics.\" I intend to base my explanation of Hora's  \nposition on these articles. Moreover, Hora had a sufficient amount of room to defend himself in the Pl\u00e1n magazine, which was published under his editorial supervision from 1929.\n\nHora's first article, entitled \"The Writer and Politics,\" describes the consequences of the campaign led by the KSC\u02c7, mainly through Rud\u00e9 pr\u00e1vo paper, against the seven writers. He expresses his bitterness over how quickly the KSC\u02c7 disposed of people who had done so much for the party in the past:\n\nAlthough referred to as liquidators and traitors, which is common terminology in the revolutionary language of the communist parties, we were somewhat surprised by the articles and verbal attacks in the communist press, which not only cursed our political expression, but also damned even our innocent literary works that came long before the proclamation. Our works were added to the list of forbidden books by the overzealous secretaries and for several months now they have not been available for the good Komsomol (communist youth organization). You will no longer recite Neumann, Hora, Seifert, or read any of the works by the others.2\n\nIn this article, Hora did not point out the fact, which presented momentum in the so-called generation debate, and which for leftist artists, particularly for the ideologists of leftist, or communist art, was very obvious. The new party establishment expelled from the community of communist writers those artists whose work most corresponded with the theme of so-called proletarian art, and in the campaign against these writers, the party willingly took advantage of artists who at the time were diverging from poetism, which was very distant from proletarian art both in its theme and form. For the time being, Hora stuck to political discussion; however, the other side, namely Karel Teige, rejected such debate.\n\nTeige attacked Hora not from the political point of view, but as an integral personality. For the so-called avant-garde art of the 1920s, such attack was something new.3 Until then, all conflicts of opinion among individual leftist artists had taken place in a more or less amicable atmosphere. The \"caf\u00e9 generation\" resolved their disputes politely, although artists expelled from Deve\u02c7tsil complained about Teige's ideological intolerance. For example, J. Seifert mentions this in his memoirs.4\n\nThe denunciation of Josef Hora was to become an example of how the art of the left was going to work under Bolshevik leadership. The fact that it was really supposed to be a denunciation is proved by Teige's words from the article \"Karel Teige: 1929\":\n\nIf with the strengthening cultural reaction there are even more cases of desertion, character somersaults and shameful coat-turning, it could be the role of the Left Front5 . . . that such cases would mean utter disqualification and moral suicide of the particular author, whereas today they are proven to be the beginning of an official career, professional advancement and academic merit. One of the most embarrassing cases of this sort is that of Josef Hora. It is not only a political case. It is clearly not only a matter of one's political conviction, if an author who parts ways with the communist party and signs a proclamation supporting the destructive opposition moves directly to work for an anticommunist, or even a social fascist evening paper.6\n\nFurther, Teige calls Hora the Czech \"Trotsky,\" a henchman of the Melantrich Publishing House (owned by National Socialist party); he accuses him of impoverished cultural conscience and literary character and labels his poetry as revolutionary tendentiousness.\n\nHora's response to Teige's criticism was also aimed personally.\n\nIn his criticism, Teige appears to be a communist of the current politburo who with a boyish radicalism dares spit on everything that lacks the seal of his political secretariat. I would accept this speech of his if I knew that Teige really is what he pretends to be, that is, a true communist. The crazy conviction of our leftist communists that apart from them and their lengthy theorems there is otherwise no life in the world can in a normal person only invoke a smile of understanding at their mental state. But Karel Teige is a communist just as much as a cockatoo is a bird of prey, which could easily be revealed if he were to take a test in the ABCs of communism. Communism is only a coquettishly donned mask of youthful radicalism on his face. Today, Teige finds communism convenient just as he found intellectual individualism convenient in the past. I wrote in my brochure [Literature and Politics] about communist snobs, and Teige is one of them. . . . Everything positive that Karel Teige did in our culture grew outside communism and is tightly linked with today's bourgeois European culture. Therefore, next time, Karel Teige, for the sake of communism as well as in his own interest, should apply his temperament, his skills and his promotional and polemic strength in his own sphere and leave communism alone.7\n\nTeige then reproached Hora for accepting, together with V. Vanc\u02c7ura, the State Literature Award, which according to Teige was evidence of their political opportunism. Hora responded to this criticism in the C\u02c7in (Act) magazine led by M. Majerov\u00e1:\n\nIn the Dav (Crowd) magazine, Teige is referred to almost as 'the chairman of a generation' and we rejoice over the fact that he has finally received such recognition from the young generation. He fights in their name, he coins slogans for them, supported by theses of the Politburo just as promptly as 'Dada' did in the past. He finally got to where he could have been a long time ago. He assumed the role of an avant-garde leader of the truly left, i.e. communist cultural front.8\n\nI have devoted so much attention to the Hora-Teige dispute for several interconnected reasons. Firstly, Hora was the only \"liquidator\" who never found his way back to the KSC\u02c7. Secondly, this dispute was also a sort of a climax of generation disputes between poetists and their critics from the middle-aged generation of leftist artists. Thirdly, it was conducted within a clearly defined conflict of two different views of the changes in the Communist Party in 1928 and 1929. And fourthly, Teige's shifting positions demonstrate his constant adjustment to the newest, fashionable trend, whether it be in the area of art or politics. Gottwald's leadership was new and modern, as it had no ties with the party's social democratic past, which is why Teige gave it his full and unconditional support.\n\nThis typical salon communism, which for a long time ignored the real consequences and effects of the politics of the Communist Party, that is, the Communist International, was given the most room for its attacks against people with a different view of the events and changes in the communist movement during the period following the fifth congress of KSC\u02c7, that is, at the beginning of the activity of the Left Front. Teige was undoubtedly one of the typical communist intellectuals in the inter-war period in Czechoslovakia\u2014ignoring the real effects of communism, mindful of the empty phrases of Marxist theory, which for the Soviet and, following the fifth congress of the KSC\u02c7, also for Czechoslovak Bolsheviks meant nothing more than an ideological crutch, which could have been modified any time under the slogan of Leninism, that is, a \"critical\" approach to Marxism and its application to specific political conditions. Teige's lack of criticism of Soviet communism and its Czechoslovak section lasted for twenty years, while a number of other leftist intellectuals never sobered up at all.\n\nHora never found a staunch supporter;9 however, he continued to speak out against the current KSC\u02c7 leadership and the communist movement. In his criticism of the coup in the KSC\u02c7 leadership, Hora included his findings from his trip to the Soviet Union in 1925:\n\nI returned from Russia with the image of a great and incendiary effort, the image of a heroic country. . . . But we also came to the realization that . . . there is also another kind of communism, a communism taken over by small and incompetent people . . . who are foolish enough to believe that such communism can win by turning the movement into a mechanical, bureaucratic machine, turning people into machines of revolution. . . . The living human being has disappeared from the decadent communist movement in various countries, replaced by the Communist International with mere bearers of ideological theses.10\n\nProfessional literature dedicated to the problems of the interwar art of the left often states that the generation debate was initiated by Jindr\u02c7ich tyrsk\u00fd in his article \"Koutek generace\" (Generation Corner), published in the Odeon magazine. Considering the fact that the article was published before the \"Proclamation of the Seven,\" this view can be accepted. tyrsk\u00fd attacked the Deve\u02c7tsil generation that he was a member of himself for its \"corruptness, spinelessness and meretriciousness. The quality is measured [by artists of the Deve\u02c7tsil generation] by the degree of success achieved by knowing the right people. . . . The poet has freed himself of all prejudice and admires the heroes of the revolution (as much) as the heroes of the counterrevolution.\"11\n\ntyrsk\u00fd's article did not bring a breakthrough in the relationship among leftist artists. When tyrsk\u00fd accuses his generation of abandoning its ideals, set out in the manifesto New Proletarian Art, he is certainly not the first one to do so, and his article is not the most offensive of all the reactions to Deve\u02c7tsil's poetists. Not taking into account the criticism by right-wing artists, we can mention the reactions of the leftist artists of the older generation (see the previous chapters). tyrsk\u00fd's primacy lay in his self-criticism as a member of Deve\u02c7tsil. Still, it is unlikely that his article, which mainly dealt with the choice of artistic criteria of leftist writers, would launch the avalanche of debates seen in the following months. In my opinion, the real impetus of the generation debate was the proclamation of the \"seven\" and the \"twelve\" that is, the dispute between Josef Hora and Karel Tiege.\n\nBefore I begin the treatise on the generation debate, I need to clarify certain expressions that are and will be used in the text. If I speak about the generation debate, I use this expression as a technical term, realizing that it does not refer to a debate of a generation, but rather a debate about a generation. However, even this description is misleading, as the debate was not narrowed down to a polemic about artists associated with Deve\u02c7tsil, that is, leftist artists born around 1900. Therefore, in order not to confuse the terminology, I will stick to the established expression generation debate. Further, to simplify the explanation, I will use the terms realists and modernists. The term realists refers to those artists of the left who stuck to the concept of proletarian art as an art of realistic description; while the term modernists denotes those of leftist artists whose artistic work was not subjected to (socialist) realism.\n\nIn fact, the entire generation debate took place in the Tvorba magazine, which in 1928 F. X. alda handed over to Julius Fuc\u02c7\u00edk, a leftist critic of the young generation. J. Fuc\u02c7\u00edk unconditionally subjected himself to the new leadership of the KSC\u02c7, so we cannot expect to find any articles by Hora in Tvorba. However, generally it can be said that the KSC\u02c7 did not intervene too noticeably in the generation debate, though it is clear that the party was involved in it. At the fifth congress of the KSC\u02c7, the new leadership definitively turned away from the Proletkult concept of cultural politics and declared a \"struggle to gain the best writers of progressive literature.\" The KSC\u02c7 welcomed the active approach of writers at the party's events; however, it was accentuated that the main expression of the political activity of communist writers is their own artwork. Among other things, the generation debate attempted to formulate the criteria that the KSC\u02c7 was to apply in the assessment of whether a writer was a communist.\n\nWhat were the realists' reservations about the modernists, paradoxically worded by J. tyrsk\u00fd, who himself was a modernist? What does he mean by the crisis of criteria? According to the manifesto New Proletarian Art, the primary prerequisite for and a sign of new (that is communist) art was to be its revolutionism. Further, the manifesto read: \"The new art will be realistic. We strongly believe in factuality, . . . experience, and recognition.\" Thus, the young Deve\u02c7tsil artists embraced Marxist dialectic, but following their shift from proletarian art to poetism, their artwork had very little in common with dialectics and realism, and that is what tyrsk\u00fd had in mind when he wrote about the crisis of criteria.\n\nRepresentatives of literary realism, especially S. K. Neumann, soon noticed and described this contradiction between theory and practice. The lack of interest in cultural politics until 1929 on the part of the KSC\u02c7 meant that modernists could officially produce their art next to the realists without anyone doubting their communist sentiment. Josef Hora pointed this out when he wrote:\n\nIt was a mistake to think that the young poets\u2014who from 1924 followed the slogan of poetism, promoting art as a playful game, unwilling to transform political ideas and revolutionary gestures into rhyme, but instead wielding beautiful words and indulging in gorgeous and fantastic images of a vibrant world, which in spite of all the social misery is so beautiful\u2014ran away from socialism. Our poetists, associated with Deve\u02c7tsil, always claimed their loyalty to the idea of revolution and managed to prove it by turning poetry into a beautiful game. They are giving the proletariat more than proletarian poetry ever could.12\n\nThus, poetism was questioned, not by the KSC\u02c7, which attempted to gain as many popular artists as possible, but paradoxically by one of its own, a member of the leftist cultural community. In his article, tyrsk\u00fd questioned whether Deve\u02c7tsil writers could be considered socialist or communist, if they use an individualistic style based on the modernist cultural trends of the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nIt could be said that the generation debate took place among leftist art theoreticians and literary critics. Apart from theoretical contemplation on the form of socialist art, virtually all participants of the generation debate expressed their opinion of the \"Proclamation of the Seven,\" condemned by most. What is important is that apart from Karel Teige, the polemic was joined also by other communist literary critics\u2014especially the new, mostly realistic generation, whose most well-known representatives were J. Fuc\u02c7\u00edk, Vladim\u00edr Clementis, Eduard Urx, B. V\u00e1clavek and Ladislav toll. F. X. alda also took part in the debate.\n\nAs alda's view is most void of personal antipathy and dogmatic accusations, and because this publication does not intend to focus on a description of the debate on literary theory, I will include several excerpts from alda's article \"Disputes and Conflicts in the Deve\u02c7tsil Generation,\" published in the Tvorba magazine. First, alda defends the seven signatories of the Proclamation:\n\nI have never been a member of the communist party, I have never lived a political life in the party and therefore I cannot judge whether the accusation of the seven writers was substantiated\u2014but I know all of the protesters as true and honest individuals, who dearly loved communist ideas and that for years they lived them and served the party selflessly. I know that this proclamation was not done out of recklessness or for an external effect. Perhaps they were mistaken in their accusation, they may have judged unfairly\u2014but still, they should have received guidance instead of being expelled and silenced. No party, not even the communist party, may have the absolute power of the church,13 because it cannot have its absolute dogma: the right to discuss must be granted, especially to intellectuals.14\n\nAt the time the article was published, alda was involved in the establishment of the Left Front, an independent section of the KSC\u02c7, but his judgment is based more on the point of view of literary criticism than politics. Still, alda did not refrain from giving advice to the seven expelled writers on what they should do following their proclamation.\n\nWhat did some of the expelled writers do, mainly Hora and Seifert?15 They began to write for bourgeois papers\u2014first, they published their poems in the Lidov\u00e9 noviny and C\u02c7esk\u00e9 slovo papers,16 later they joined the editorial staff of these papers\u2014Hora is an editor of the national socialist evening paper today. I think that was a mistake and I stated that in a letter to Hora in the summer: what impression will it leave on a worker who used to read Hora's works in Rud\u00e9 pr\u00e1vo paper and now sees his writings in the Lidov\u00e9 noviny paper, where editors constantly disparage communism? The seven writers should have established their own magazine or moved en masse to some of the socialist papers.17\n\nalda never mentions that the new leadership of the KSC\u02c7 gave instructions to denounce the signatories, that their artwork was forbidden to be read by party members, that the party press published articles doubting not only the artistic value of their work but also the writers' moral qualities. I would not want to suspect him of neglecting facts. I am more willing to believe, considering the later sobering and departure from the Left Front, that he really was not informed of these things. To defend the expelled writers, we need to add that they did attempt to establish their own magazines. I have already mentioned Hora's Pl\u00e1n; however, it was terminated in 1932 due to insufficient financial resources. During the magazine's three-year existence, only eight issues were published. In 1929, M. Majerov\u00e1 became editor of a new magazine called C\u02c7in.\n\nalda addresses the generation debate through Hora's dispute with Teige, which substantiates my opinion that it was this dispute which provided the generation debate with momentum and without which it would never have reached such proportions. alda notices Teige's motivation resulting from his position of the generation's speaker:\n\nK. Teige attacks Hora, but why Hora? Because as a journalist he was the closest target\u2014but I am probably not mistaken if I also hear a sort of a generation aversion to Hora, who is not a \"pure\" Deve\u02c7tsil member. His age is closer to the so-called pragmatic generation. . . . Teige is convinced that a new, modern poet must also have a modern world view, that is, Marxism and communism. . . . But Hora replies \"I continue to be a communist, because communism is something else and much more than the communist party, let alone its current leadership, which hands out instructions today but tomorrow may very well be thrown out of the party: communism is my faith, my conviction . . . a source of my poetry.\"18\n\nalda gives a true picture of what the generation debate at that time (early 1930) was really all about. It was not about the criteria, but the writers' membership in communist organizations. During the debate, two contradicting views emerged. One, defended by Hora, can be simply formulated as follows: One can be a communist and write in the spirit of proletarian art without being a member of the Communist Party. On the other hand, the opposing view, reinforced by the KSC\u02c7 by creating the Left Front, can be summarized as: The contents and form of a work of art do not determine whether its author is a communist writer; the only criterion distinguishing a communist writer is his membership in the Communist Party or some of its satellite organizations. Karel Teige held this view in the debate.\n\nTeige, who was considered as the speaker and ideologist of Deve\u02c7tsil, was obsessed with modernism. He welcomed with enthusiasm new trends in art and politics and was willing to do almost anything to implement the fashionable \"novelties.\" He embraced revolutionary art and collectivism, and his activities19 speak to the fact that it was not a mere whim. At the same time, though, his artistic work or his views of art theory (not political views) are evidence that he was an individualist, unwilling to conform to directives and the collective concept of public engagement represented, for example, by the organization of a political party. The fact that he felt he was a communist, yet at the same time refused orders from above, was a contradiction.20\n\nTeige wanted to remain a communist; however, he was not willing to give up his position as an independent art ideologist of Deve\u02c7tsil. It is possible that this motive for defending his own autonomy and the right to choose any artistic style within communist art was reflected in his aggressive attacks against Josef Hora. If such motive did in fact exist, then it went along with the temporary intention of the cultural politics of the new leadership of the KSC\u02c7, which made maximum efforts to win leftist artists over to their side. As it was impossible to attract everyone to become members of the party, it was necessary to establish an organization that would be controlled by the KSC\u02c7, while it would seemingly maintain its independence. The Left Front, established on October 18, 1929, was to become such an organization.\n\nThe Left Front\n\nIt has already been said several times that one of the main goals the Communist Party set for itself at the fifth congress was to win over the intelligentsia, which the party had previously rejected mainly for ideological reasons. According to F. Hele\u0161ic, the new cultural organization of the KSC\u02c7 was to target \"that part of the middle class, particularly its intelligentsia, which had not expressed itself politically and held the position of nonconformism, bourgeois democratism or humanism.\"21\n\nFollowing the overthrow of the group of people who oversaw the cultural policy before the fifth congress\u2014let me just remind you that these were mainly artists rooted in the former, anarchist-based Union of Communist Groups\u2014there came forward a communist cultural organization which prided itself on its members' proletarian roots and also the true proletarianism of their art production: the Czechoslovak Workers Amateur Actors Association. Movie and theatre director Franti\u0161ek Spitzer, a member of the Association, expressed his idea of the cultural policy of the communist party as follows: \"At a time when the economic front merges with the political front, we cannot allow a third, cultural front to emerge.  \n. . . The bourgeois culture must be put in quarantine so that it cannot reach the workers.\"22 According to Spitzer, all cultural workers of the Communist Party should be transferred to the economic front, that is, under the Red Trade Unions. His suggestion was that the Communist Party give up on any kind of cultural policy. Two months later, this proposal was rejected by E. Urx in the article \"Putting Down the Weapons on the Cultural Front. F. Spitzer's Big Mistake.\"23 Meanwhile, Karel Teige was already organizing the Left Front.\n\nOn October 18, 1929, from Teige's initiative, about thirty cultural workers met at the Opera caf\u00e9 in Prague. It was a meeting of people \"bound together by the organized and conscious resistance of the intellectual productive force against the leading and decomposing liberal culture, against its traditions, anachronisms, esthetic and morality, against the disorganized and withering social system.\"24\n\nAn organization called the Left Front was established at the meeting.\n\nThe Left Front intends to concentrate and mobilize the cultural left. . . . At the same time, the Left Front strives to establish a direct connection with its audience. . . . The activities of the Left Front will be of an international character. . . . The Left Front intends to concentrate on working together in all activities, whose production is enlivened by the modern spirit and which is the manifestation of modern will\u2014modern architects, writers, journalists, lawyers, [etc]. . . . 25 The base the Left Front is being built upon is the revolution. The Left Front, as a non-political organization, is not affiliated with any political party, but rather a working collaboration of the international intellectual community.26\n\nAt the end of the proclamation, the names of several members are provided: F. X. alda, V. Vanc\u02c7ura, V. Nezval, V. Z\u00e1vada, K. Teige, F. Halas, J. Seifert, L. Novomesk\u00fd, I. Sekanina, M. C\u02c7erm\u00ednov\u00e1 (further referred to only as Toyen), J. tyrsk\u00fd, B. V\u00e1clavek, and others. The list of names could make one believe that the Left Front was merely Deve\u02c7tsil expanded by representatives of other generations and professions, but this feeling would be entirely misleading.\n\nThe Left Front was definitely not a loose association of left-leaning intellectuals. Already in the initial proclamation, everyone who agrees with its viewpoint and wants to actively participate in its work is asked to become a member.27 An even more warning signal was the proclaimed concentration of the intellectual productive leftist force. Anyone who was not a member of the Left Front could be labeled unprogressive, unproductive, that is, right wing.28 Exactly this type of argumentation was used against Josef Hora, when he expressed the conviction that in terms of ideology he could be a communist even without being a member of the KSC\u02c7.\n\nHora continued to insist on his opinion. In the first issue of the second volume of his Pl\u00e1n magazine, he ponders the role of the magazine. He sees its main role in once again bringing together leftist artists.\n\nThe first volume of Pl\u00e1n started to be published last year [1929], at a critical time for the young literary generation in our country. Especially for the left wing of literature, it was a time of painful disputes and organizational split-ups. We came at a time when the idea of generation began to disappear from the thoughts of its bearers and when its individual, maturing members started to move away from the common foundation. And also at a time when the crisis of our cultural left manifested itself in many breakups. . . . Our ambition is to gather, if possible, all the talent of the young generations. Let us not forget that Pl\u00e1n has no intention of supporting the reaction and the mustiness, but rather of remaining what it started out as: a paper aware of the fact that modern art is possible only on the platform of socialism, that it thrives on its spirit and grows against anarchy, bringing the twilight of the capitalist social order.29\n\nHowever, Hora's insistence on modernness did not rid him of the curse cast by the Communist Party. The establishment of the Left Front resolved the main problem of the generation debate. The program of the Left Front rejected Hora's views, while giving those of Teige the green light. From then on, the general rule was that an artist or an intellectual was considered progressive, communist, and so on, as long as he was organized either directly in KSC\u02c7 or in one of its satellite organizations\u2014in this case, in the Left Front\u2014or at least gives the impression of being a member.30 Under these conditions, they are given freedom as to the contents and form of their art production.\n\nThe role of chairman of the Left Front was taken by the \"generation chairman\"31 Karel Teige. It would be unfair to consider this role as a mere reward for the uncompromising campaign against Hora. Even independent observers, for example, Karel Pol\u00e1c\u02c7ek or V\u00e1clav C\u02c7ern\u00fd, viewed Teige as the true spiritual leader of the generation. The Left Front was also a solution to the polemic on what would replace the fading poetism. Teige did not have to look for a new, collectivizing -ism, because the Left Front's main job was to carry out \"collectivization.\"\n\nThe figure of Karel Teige as head of the Left Front did not appeal to \"the lost son\" S. K. Neumann, who joined the generation debate in the spring of 1930 with his article \"Discussion on the Generation's Purity.\" In the article he rejected any speculation about a crisis of the criteria of Marxist writers. For Neumann, the criterion is clearly dialectical materialism, applicable to all areas.\n\nThe confusion on the left front [does not refer to the organization] was caused by communist theoreticians and critics who systematically accepted everything that was \"avant-garde\" and \"non-conformist,\" always putting it in the right place in the development of modernness, revealing the roots of trends, personalities and their work and the \"right\" and \"left\" elements in them . . . they overlooked all the dialectical materialism and flirted with spiritualism. . . . Karel Teige elevated surrealism in a way that for me, as a communist, is incomprehensible and unacceptable. . . . In our country, there is no tradition of dialectical materialism, revolutionary Marxism is deeply rooted neither as a method, nor a world view. Only in the area of politics was something substantial achieved, otherwise almost nothing. . . . I would like to tell Karel Teige, the most talented, and as far as esthetics goes, the most educated and hardest working representative of this generation, this: Look, comrade, you are wasting your energy by serving as an agent for all kinds of would-be avant-garde movements and phenomena, big and small.32\n\nS. K. Neumann thus presents dialectical materialism as a universal remedy which can resolve the generation debate, because if everyone produces art from the same point of view, then there will be no more disputes.\n\nWith its proclaimed concentration, the Left Front represented true Bolshevization in the area of culture in the KSC\u02c7. The independence of political parties, which the Left Front boasted, later turned out to be mere fiction, as evidenced by the following steps in the area of cultural policy. The birth of the Left Front also resolved the problem of intellectual opposition within the KSC\u02c7. However, the generation debate went on, because the Left Front lacked a specific program and main goals.\n\nDuring 1930, the Left Front was gradually transformed into an organization fully subordinated to the KSC\u02c7. Its communist members (I. Sekanina, L. Novomesk\u00fd, and others) \"attempted to free this organization of intellectuals from the narrow avant-garde concept, increase its membership numbers with unaffiliated intelligentsia and bring it closer to the struggle of the revolutionary proletariat, and even subject it to the political objectives of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia.\"33 The affected change meant the replacement of Karel Teige as the Left Front's chairman with his theoretical opponent of many years, S. K. Neumann, who also became an editor of the Lev\u00e1 fronta magazine, which served as a platform for the young generation of communist art critics to publish. The Left Front was still not structured in any way; it was merely a relatively loose group of people who communicated with one another by way of its leaders, or its press, which was rather unusual for a satellite organization of the Communist Party. Neumann also insisted that the Left Front must remain independent of what was happening in the Communist Party. \"The Left Front is not an institution of a political party: no idea voiced therein can threaten the unity or discipline of a larger unit, therefore, the method of the Left Front may be free, yet sensibly conducted discussion, and as for the supporters of various shades, its methods can be patience and persuasion rather than criticism and expulsion.\"34\n\nThus Neumann\u2014probably based on his own experience with Gottwald's leadership\u2014keeps his distance from the KSC\u02c7 and intends to build up the new cultural organization similarly to Proletkult in the early 1920s. His comments on the politics of the Communist Party were very skeptical.\n\nOne by one, our leaders and ideologists went to Moscow and they all failed. Simply said: If I know that I would have failed, had I bet everything on meral's success; if I know that I would have also failed, had I bet it all on Neurath's or J\u00edlek's success, what is the guarantee of betting on Guttmann's success, for example? In Czechoslovakia, a thinking person who does not want to be swayed like a leaf in the wind must find such guarantee only in his or her own informed judgment.35\n\nNeumann's skepticism from the development in the Communist Party illustrates how much confusion the ideological disputes and constant changes in the KSC\u02c7 caused on the left cultural scene. Neumann's opportunist opinion that it is best not to affiliate oneself with any \"faction\" of the KSC\u02c7, could have only been the bitter sigh of a leftist intellectual with bad experience, but also criticism of K. Teige, who recklessly jumped into all the sorts of \"modernness\" that appeared.\n\nBetween November 6 and 15, 1930, the International Congress of Revolutionary Literature was held in Kharkov. A paper on the situation of leftist culture in Czechoslovakia was presented by V. Clementis, who described the transformation of Deve\u02c7tsil to poetism and stated that \"the Deve\u02c7tsil group suffered from proletkultism,\"36 and continued to speak about the proclamation of the seven writers, whom he divided into social fascists (Hora and Seifert) and those who remained progressive, revolutionary intellectuals (S. K. Neumann).\n\nMore important than Clementis's speech, which only superficially described the development of the left avant-garde, was an open letter, which the congress addressed to the revolutionary writers in Czechoslovakia. The letter also summarizes the recent developments in the Czechoslovak left avant-garde, but additionally it also contains a sort of an algorithm telling Czech writers what to do to calm the turbulent situation. Among others, the instructions include:\n\nIn order to newly build, remedy and fortify the literary revolutionary movement in Czechoslovakia, it is necessary to establish a strong organization as a platform and revolutionary line of all literary work. Its foundation will be the ideological and creative platform of the International Bureau of Revolutionary Literature, which sets the following conditions for its cooperation:\n\n1. struggle against the imperialist war and for the protection of the Soviet Union,\n\n2. struggle against fascism and the white terror, and\n\n3. energetic struggle against all facets of social fascism.\n\nRevolutionary literature in Czechoslovakia can no longer limit itself to literary masterpieces and the collaboration with proletarian and agrarian writers, but mainly on working with the masses. . . . Writers need to collaborate with the revolutionary proletariat on an international scale and with revolutionary writers from around the world. In order to achieve that, systematic cooperation on an organizational basis must be initiated in Czechoslovakia. Its foundation can be the Tvorba magazine.\n\nSigned by Egon Erwin Kisch, who represented Czechoslovakia at the fifth world conference of proletarian revolutionary literature in Charkov.37\n\nIt was not true that the Left Front had done nothing until then; for example, J. Fuc\u02c7\u00edk had drawn up a list of newspapers and magazines to which no \"orthodox\" leftist intellectual should contribute. Thanks to S. K. Neumann, the Lev\u00e1 fronta magazine kept a certain distance and partial autonomy. Neumann continued to present his own evaluation of the developments in KSC\u02c7 with regard to Bolshevization, which was not always fully in line with the official policies of Gottwald's leadership. Neumann based his evaluation on a conviction which he reached while assessing the activities of intellectuals in the KSC\u02c7. \"It is more beneficial for the party and even for intellectuals, provided the intellectual stands outside the party lines, if the party is not responsible for his deviations, scruples, moods and whims and if it doesn't suppress them; if the intellectual is not directly responsible for his work and life to the party.\"38\n\nThe sixth congress of the KSC\u02c7, held between March 7 and 11, 1931, only confirmed that the Left Front really was not an independent organization. At the congress the Left Front was presented as a faction of the KSC\u02c7. Although the agenda focused mostly on the economic crisis and the party's activities at this time, it also included the area of culture. For the first time in the history of KSC\u02c7 congresses, there was a presentation of revolutionary artists,39 given by an \"unknown\" member of the National Theater, Mr. Fam\u00edra, instead of one of the leading figures in the cultural field, who only sent their greetings (V. Nezval, S. K. Neumann, V. Vanc\u02c7ura) which were presented with special attention at the congress.\n\nThe fact that the congress was attended by representatives of all classes was to emphasize the party's popularity with all people of revolutionary spirit. The closing speech, presented by K. Gottwald, laid the foundations for the establishment of the so-called popular front, which was to include a maximum number of left-leaning people. Therefore, the KSC\u02c7 did not see its biggest enemy in the right-wing and fascist parties, but instead in the socialist parties.40 The Left Front was to play a role in the KSC\u02c7's campaign against these parties. Steps were taken to transform the Left Front into a real faction of the KSC\u02c7. Following the communist party's sixth congress, the leadership of the Prague branch of the Left Front was joined by Z. Nejedl\u00fd, L. toll, P. Reiman, and others.\n\nAlready on June 6 and 7, 1931, the first imperial conference of the Left Front was held in Brno in order to carry out its institutionalization in line with the requests of the International Bureau of Revolutionary Literature. The main speeches were presented by L. toll and V. Clementis, which speaks to the fact that the conference was under close supervision by the communist party. P. Reiman also sent a letter to the conference. Among other things, the letter stated: \"An exclusive organization of intellectuals, separated from other proletarian organizations, is useless . . . the Left Front should also include workers among their midst, which can only be done provided they refrain from leading scholastic intellectual discussions, but rather concentrate on serious educational Marxist work.\"41 Reiman thus promotes the conclusions of the Kharkov congress of revolutionary literature.\n\nThe documentation of the Left Front conference shows a remarkable similarity to the resolutions of the sixth congress of the KSC\u02c7 in the area of strategy, and also a remarkable similarity to the resolutions of the Constituent and the first regular congress of the KSC\u02c7 as far as organizational issues are concerned. Following a general criticism of the existing economic and political system in Czechoslovakia and the \"non-Soviet\" world, the Left Front declares war on this establishment:\n\nThe working intelligentsia42 is left with only one choice, which fully corresponds with its interests: uniting with the proletariat, the narrow group becoming one with the proletarian masses in both the city and the country. On this road, the working intelligentsia, side by side with the proletariat, must defend its economic, political and cultural interests. The most important issues of this struggle at present are:\n\na) Struggle against economic impoverishment of the intelligentsia, especially against unemployment\n\nb) Struggle against political reaction, against Fascization and anything that might be supporting it; against counterrevolutionary social democracy and other \"socialist\" parties, etc.\n\n. . . We are convinced that the struggle of the working intelligentsia in all areas must be planned and its organization improved. The main goal in this sense of the word is the transformation of the Left Front into a real, mass organization of the working intelligentsia, which as a bridge will include the intelligentsia in the proletarian class struggle. This is how the Left Front will achieve this goal:\n\na) Sections will be organized in all areas of the intelligentsia.\n\nb) Members of these sections of the Left Front will form tight-knit groups in the corresponding trade union organizations and there, by way of collective and personal campaigning, they will show the working intelligentsia the right way and lead the struggle for its vital interests\n\nc) Members of the Left Front will be obliged to set up new branches of the Left Front, wherever there are suitable conditions . . .\n\nf) By its press, which requires the 'Lev\u00e1 fronta' weekly to be transformed into a magazine for the masses.43\n\nThere could have been no more doubt about the purpose the Left Front was to serve and who it was subordinated to. With this resolution, it took on all signs of the communist organizational structure, including the mandatory establishment of cells. Moreover, the Lev\u00e1 fronta paper was to be transformed into \"Rud\u00e9 pr\u00e1vo for the working intelligentsia.\"\n\nThe Left Front further announced its cultural concept, in which, similarly to the KSC\u02c7, it distanced itself from the Proletkult concept of new culture and formalist sectarianism,44 from Trotskyism, reformism, and other \"deviations.\" On the other hand, it accented the importance of the working class for the progressive intelligentsia: \"We reject the understatement of the proletariat's influence on other classes.\"45 This cultural concept also showed that writers were still perceived slightly differently from other working intellectuals, as they were mentioned separately: \"In the area of literature, we are fully behind the resolutions of the Charkov conference of proletarian writers and we want to work both for revolutionary culture of the proletariat in general as well for revolutionary proletarian literature, and we are fully supportive of the Association of Proletarian Writers in Czechoslovakia in these areas.\"46 The Left Front further set up so-called cultural sections, which were to apply the views of the revolutionary proletariat in the area of art. These sections were supposed to closely collaborate with the Association of Proletarian Writers, and so on.\n\nThus, before its first imperial conference, the Left Front transformed itself into a proper satellite organization of the KSC\u02c7 with a similar structure, program, goals, and terminology that were typical for the Communist Party itself. For writers, the conference meant a complete inclination to the understanding of revolutionary art only as art based on dialectical materialism. At the time it did not mean a farewell to \"formalist\" movements of many writers, especially because following the departure of some of the seven signatories, they represented a sort of flagship or formal revolutionary art. For now, modernists were only assigned to lower positions in the Lev\u00e1 fronta paper, which was taken over by communist critics J. Fuc\u02c7\u00edk, L. toll, and others, who used it to publish official views of the party line and in their reviews targeted mainly \"social fascist\" writers and publicists.\n\nNotes\n\n1.

This undoubtedly resulted from the fact that it was difficult to determine the position of the intelligentsia in the ideology of proletarian revolution. In spite of the communists' skeptical attitude, many members of the intelligentsia supported the KSC\u02c7, collaborated with it, and became members or loyal followers. However, the KSC\u02c7 could hardly deny its \"proletarian\" style. With the exception of the constituent congress of the Communist Party, which was attended by S. K. Neumann in the role of an observer, the presidia of congresses held between the two world wars, let alone the political bureau or the central (formerly executive) committee, included hardly any members of the intelligentsia, unless we consider the journalist functionaries who took control of the party press following the fifth congress of the KSC\u02c7 as members of the intelligentsia.\n\nThe Communist Party refused to entrust its leadership to anyone else but a representative of the proletariat, that is, only people with \"working class roots.\"1 Still, the party did not want to give up on gaining a certain share of the left intelligentsia in society. Therefore, the Left Front was transformed into an institution of the party with a party-like organizational structure and the obligation to establish offshoot sections of the Left Front, whose lead was taken over by artists who considered themselves not only the avant-garde in arts, but also politics.\n\nLeftist artists were soon to prove their ideological loyalty to communism and also to the Bolshevik leadership of the KSC\u02c7. The occasion was the world economic recession, which in the 1920s and 1930s also affected Czechoslovakia. Although this is not the main topic of this publication, I cannot help but mention the conduct of KSC\u02c7 at this time. However, I will attempt to describe these events in the light of aspects that are often overlooked, or considered irrelevant and of secondary importance.\n\nWhen in 1930 S. K. Neumann claimed that his signature below the proclamation of seven writers was a mistake flowing from the difficult situation of the KSC\u02c7 at the time following the party's fifth congress, and from the assumption that Bolshevization would mean a catastrophic loss of popularity of the party with the Czechoslovak public,2 then either in connection with the results of the parliamentary election he was content with the \"mere\" loss of two hundred thousand supporters when compared to the support in the 1925 parliamentary election, or he was very well aware of the following. After its Bolshevization, the KSC\u02c7 did face a decline in popularity with its supporters, which considering the division of the communist trade unions in half could have been much more substantial. One of the reasons why such a decline did not occur was on the one hand the economic crisis and the activity of the KSC\u02c7 during this time, and on the other hand the (in)activity of other political parties which could have potentially attracted disgruntled followers of the KSC\u02c7.3\n\nThe opinions on the conduct during the economic crisis varied in the KSC\u02c7. The party obviously supported and instigated strike movements\u2014during which writer members of the KSC\u02c7 and the Left Front were to raise the strikers' morale4\u2014the root of the disputes was more related to the degree of collaboration with so-called reformist parties that presented a certain competition. The sixth congress of the KSC\u02c7 forbade any kind of cooperation with these parties, and declared war on them, particularly social democracy.\n\nHowever, this stance was not supported by a relatively strong faction of the Communist Party led by J. Guttmann. While according to the resolutions of the sixth congress the so-called popular front under the auspices of the KSC\u02c7 was to be established at any cost, Guttmann suggested that at the time of economic crisis a united front be formed on the basis of a compromise with the social-democratic program.5 The Komunistick\u00e1 revue, revived in 1930 after more than an eight-month break, became a platform for promoting these ideas. Guttmann was considering seizing power in the country by a coalition of left-wing parties, an idea officially pressed by the KSC\u02c7 in the last few years of the existence of the first Czechoslovak Republic. However, the party rejected Guttmann's views as an opportunist trend.\n\nGuttmann's proposal of partnership between the KSC\u02c7 and social democracy was unacceptable also for social democrats themselves, who felt strong hostility toward the Soviet Union and considered Stalin a dictator. The anti-Soviet views probably played a decisive role in the potential return of a large number of members of the KSC\u02c7 and its satellite organizations to social democracy.\n\nThe views of the KSC\u02c7 somewhat changed with the rise of Nazism in Germany. As one of the primary goals of his political program, Hitler declared war on the Communist International, which in turn urged its sections as early as on March 3, 1933 to create a united front against fascism. Following the convention of the Central Committee of the KSC\u02c7 on March 16, an open letter to the executive committees of reformist parties, that is, the Czechoslovak and German social democracy and the Czechoslovak National Socialist Party, was published with an appeal to put up a united fight against \"hunger, fascism and war.\" The KSC\u02c7 offered the reformist parties a joint fight against Gajda and Str\u02c7\u00edbrn\u00fd.6 Three days later, the conference of the Red Trade Unions came with similar appeals and offers to all trade unionists.\n\nThe propositions of cooperation must be perceived as opportunist, especially considering the tone the communist press had used to refer to both Czechoslovak and German social democrats only days or weeks before. As an example of such rhetoric, let me quote from P. Reiman's article \"Hitler's Dictatorship in Germany,\" which was published in the February issue of the Komunistick\u00e1 revue:\n\nOnly the confused petite bourgeoisie can believe that the establishment of a fascist dictatorship in Germany is a major turnaround. The claim of the Communist International that there is not a big difference between democracy and fascism is completely true even now. . . . Hitler did not come masked as some \"revolutionary,\" but as a legal heir [of German social democrats] to Noske, Scheidemann and Bert.7\n\nIn February of 1933, the KSC\u02c7 still referred to social democrats as social fascists, and a month later, it offered to collaborate with them.\n\nHowever, the reformist parties that at the time formed the government refused to take part in activities led by the Comintern and the KSC\u02c7. Within the KSC\u02c7, though, there was still the moderate wing represented by Josef Guttmann. His views of a compromise with social democracy\u2014and criticism of the Comintern's tactic in German politics, especially its perception of social democracy as the same evil as fascism\u2014were rejected by the Comintern's Executive Committee and Guttmann was asked to resign from his leadership role in the KSC\u02c7 and be \"transferred to Moscow.\" Guttmann did not act on this request and continued to express his \"opportunist\" views. He attacked the German Communist Party for succumbing to fascism and expressed the heretical idea that at the time of fascists' victory, it is necessary to suspend the revolutionary struggle and move to more moderate, unified positions.8\n\nEspecially because of Guttmann, the Komunistick\u00e1 revue ceased to be published in October 1933.9 In its last issue, representatives of Gottwald's leadership explain the reasons behind its closure. In Gottwald's words, \"because we are entering a time of the most severe struggle, a time when the bourgeoisie attempts to deprive our movement of legality, we have to stamp out any expression of opportunism.\"10 According to another author, B. K\u00f6hler, the press \"led by Guttmann and Reiman11 daily expressed views that were entirely in contradiction to the party's political line, without causing vigorous resistance against this opportunist distortion of the party line. . . . The rotten liberalism pushed out the revolutionary, Bolshevik alertness in the daily politics of the party.\" Guttmann and several other communists from the group associated with the Komunistick\u00e1 revue are labeled Trotskyists.12 Not being issued a new membership card in late 1933, Guttmann ceases to be a member of the KSC\u02c7.13\n\nIt needs to be said that in 1933 and 1934 the KSC\u02c7, similarly as in previous years, was not in an easy situation. The governments of the agrarians Franti\u0161ek Udr\u017eal and Jan Malypetr took major steps against undemocratic parties. Already in February of 1931, Rud\u00e9 pr\u00e1vo paper was closed down for almost half a year. Other significant interventions against communists and also other undemocratic parties were made possible by newly passed laws, for example, the press law, which allowed the distribution of the press to be limited or even confiscated and completely banned; or the amendment to the Act on the Security of the Czech Republic, which tightened the sanctions for criticism of not only top government representatives, but also government authorities. On October 25, 1933, a law was passed allowing political parties to be banned and dissolved, which put the Communist Party on the verge of legality.14\n\nAlthough on June 9, 1934 the Czechoslovak Republic officially recognized the existence of the Soviet Union, the attitude of the government elite toward the KSC\u02c7 did not change until the end of 1935. Moreover, communists led a very disgusting campaign at the time of T. G. Masaryk's  \nreelection as president of the Czechoslovak Republic. Among other things, the campaign accused Masaryk of fascism.15 In reaction to the communists' conduct, warrants were issued for the arrest of KSC\u02c7 members of parliament Gottwald, Krosn\u00e1r\u02c7, Kopeck\u00fd, and te\u02c7tka. They represented the hard line of the party, who under the threat of trials and possible imprisonment left for the Soviet Union. For more than a year, the party's chairman, Gottwald, loses direct oversight of the events in the KSC\u02c7.16\n\nThe Surrealist Group in the Left Front\n\nThe politicking described in the previous subchapter did not really affect leftist writers, and if it did, it was in the negative sense of the word. Because of his opposition to the strict anti-Masaryk stance, F. X. alda withdrew from the Left Front, followed by S. K. Neumann. The Deve\u02c7tsil generation never took part in the Left Front's activities. From 1932, the backbone of the Left Front was made up of communist critics L. toll (from 1932 editor of the Lev\u00e1 fronta paper), J. Fuc\u02c7\u00edk, B. V\u00e1clavek, and others, who directed their attacks against social fascists K. C\u02c7apek, F. Peroutka, and so on. With such focus, the Left Front could hardly set aspirations to become an integrating force of left-wing intelligentsia and culture. Furthermore, under toll's leadership, the Lev\u00e1 fronta magazine abandons its role as the cultural newsletter of the KSC\u02c7 and instead focuses on the problems of political struggles and informing about some areas of life (not cultural) in the Soviet Union.17 The Left Front, transformed into an appendage of the Communist Party, thus started to lose credit among leftist artists and intellectuals.\n\nThe generation debate, which thanks to the establishment of the Left Front stopped midway, was supposed to come to an end at this time. It is clear that the main representatives of Deve\u02c7tsil, especially Teige, joined the Left Front only on the basis of the conviction that they would be able to continue in what proletarian art and poetism meant to them, that is, modernness. The idea that the Left Front would give Tiege more room for avant-garde art turned out to be erroneous. Moreover, Teige was not even in charge of the Left Front's organization, which he probably had difficulty accepting. Therefore, he looked for a way out.\n\nAs with every ideologist who has lost his way, Teige first turned to the past and focused on the history of Deve\u02c7tsil. In 1933, in his article \"Modern Culture Association Deve\u02c7tsil,\" he wrote:\n\nFrom the beginning, the modern culture association Deve\u02c7tsil was the centre and foundation of avant-garde trends. . . . No matter how Deve\u02c7tsil's membership changed, this group was always a narrow working partnership of the intellectual left. . . . For ten years, the Deve\u02c7tsil group worked on a program that had two facets and played two historical roles: the first role, played also by previous progressive groups, gained in urgency after the world war, which interrupted international cultural cooperation and contacts, could be characterized by the motto opening the windows into the world, catching up with Europe; while the other basically represented surpassing Europe. . . . The first part of the action program and historical mission of Deve\u02c7tsil was modernness. The other, revolutionary role was to get ahead of Europe.18\n\nAfter the four years that Teige devoted to the Left Front, he once again started to \"catch up with Europe.\" Therefore, he joined the newly established surrealist group.\n\nThe surrealist group was founded in early 1934 by some of the former Deve\u02c7tsil artists\u2014painters Toyen and J. tyrsk\u00fd, theatre and movie director J. Honzl, and poet K. Biebl, among others. From the list of signatories it is clear that Teige and Nezval joined the group only after it had been established. However, Teige became the ideologist of the group, which in terms of its program followed up on Deve\u02c7tsil. The birth of surrealism can be attributed to a much earlier date; its first manifesto was published in the mid-1920s;19 however, its application within the KSC\u02c7, or the Left Front, was problematic. Surrealism, which rejected any ties between politics and art and instead wanted to focus on changing man rather than the political system, was strongly opposed by communist literary theoreticians and critics. They criticized surrealism for its incompatibility with scientific materialism (a view held mainly by S. K. Neumann) and for not being involved in the struggle against fascism (J. toll and other Bolshevik critics in the Left Front).\n\nIn May of 1934, a debate on surrealism took place. Surrealism was defended by Teige, Nezval, and Honzl, while toll played the role of opponent. The discussion occurred in the questions of esthetics\u2014the contributions of all participants were published in the anthology Surrealismus v diskusi (Surrealism in Discussion).20 The absence of politically motivated criticism on the part of Bolshevik journalists from the Left Front was likely caused by the critics' waiting for instructions from Moscow, more specifically for the resolutions of the first All-Union Congress of Soviet Writers, held in August of 1934.\n\nMeanwhile, Teige turned the surrealist group into a close-knit \"communist\" cell. The group displayed all signs of a political organization. It was no longer a free community of artists, but a strictly organized group with clearly defined principles, the most fundamental of which was to break all rules, which worried some of its members, especially Nezval.21 The surrealist group was formally part of the Left Front, as it was the only organization of communist intellectuals acknowledged by the Communist Party. If Teige and the others had moved the group outside the Left Front, they would have automatically been considered undesirable. Still, Teige could be content. Once again he had managed\u2014although only partially\u2014to revive the collectivist spirit of Deve\u02c7tsil. However, many Deve\u02c7tsil members did not join the surrealist group. The majority did not artistically identify themselves with surrealism, but there were also other reasons. For example, Jaroslav Seifert states that \"he understood the attempt at reviving Deve\u02c7tsil as the communists' attempt to gain a campaigning tool following the failure of the Left Front, when it was abandoned by alda and Neumann.\"22 Nezval joined Teige only due to their friendship,23 and that is why we can hardly speak of the revival of the Deve\u02c7tsil collectivism. The existence of the surrealist group within the Left Front, that is, an organization under the direct supervision of the Communist Party, shows that at that time communists maintained their positions, on which the Left Front was founded. The party considers essential neither the form nor the content of artwork, but only the artist's agreement with the policies of the Communist Party. This trend was also confirmed by the All-Union Congress of Soviet Writers, which was held in 1934 under the close supervision of the Soviet party leaders. The main issue on the agenda was a discussion on the form and content of the literary work of communist writers. At the congress M. Gorkij and A. Zhdanov formulated the principles of socialist realism, which considered \"ideologically\" correct only such work that was based on the principle of dialectical materialism. On the other hand, Bukharin defended another approach, which emphasized form and artistic mastery, and which deemed the esthetic aspect to be the decisive criterion. Thus, the congress did not approve the art of socialist realism as the only possible art form, but it did initiate a discussion on the issue.24 This discussion will be elaborated on in more detail in the next chapter.\n\nApart from the formation of the surrealist group, perhaps the most significant event on the \"left front\" at this time is the skirmish among leftist writers at the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the passing of Jir\u02c7\u00ed Wolker.25 At the beginning of 1934, the Listy paper ran an article entitled \"Jir\u02c7\u00ed Wolker after Ten Years,\" authored by four writers under the pseudonym F. Hlz (Halas, B. Fuc\u02c7\u00edk, Levit, and Z\u00e1vada). The authors critically view Wolker's cult:\n\nIf we are to salvage at least the substance of Wolker's poetry, we need to do away with Wolker's cult and silence his literary and especially personal friends who still today are taking the vain effort to make Wolker literary history, recording every insignificant detail of his walks to the caf\u00e9. We must not forget it was they who led his hand and his steps to the caf\u00e9, that they played a leading role in Wolker's fame. No wonder we see the phony apotheosis, a \"magic\" folly of Jir\u02c7\u00ed Wolker with a star on his forehead. . . . Poor Wolker! How heavy all those stars must weigh on him in the grave.26\n\nThus, Halas and others attacked the Deve\u02c7tsil generation, as in their opinion they usurped Wolker as a symbol and idol. They also contested the concept which linked Jir\u02c7\u00ed Wolker to the Communist Party.27 Their article was a sort of open appeal to a discussion, not only on Wolker, but also on the relationships among left-oriented writers. A number of prominent artists affiliated in the present or in the past with the KSC\u02c7 joined the discussion.\n\nOn behalf of the \"official\" line of the KSC\u02c7, Teige and Nezval replied in their article \"Poet Franti\u0161ek Halas Believes in Communism, Melantrich and One Poetry.\" This article contains criticism of just about anything which in one way or another does not correspond with the official policy of the KSC\u02c7. Not only does the article criticize Halas and B. Fuc\u02c7\u00edk for \"partnering with Catholics in Melantrich,\" Melantrich for \"printing the works of failed ex-communists,\" but also I. Olbracht, F. X. alda, and  \nS. K. Neumann, who had parted with the Left Front. The article talks the least about Wolker.28\n\nS. K. Neumann also joined the discussion by publishing an open letter to F. Halas called \"About the Dead and the Living.\" Neumann compares the protest against Wolker's cult to the execution of a poet, whose \"misfortune, both human and literary, was the fact that he died too young.\" Quite objectively, Neumann shows that Wolker's potential development would have led to one of today's enemy groups of leftist writers and that he can be believed as neither a model poet \"who would never betray the communist party,\" nor a model poet \"who would surely understand the harmfulness of what is happening in the KSC\u02c7.\" At the end, Neumann writes: \"Dear Franti\u0161ek Halas,29 everyone gets a fair share of attention, but don't you think that Jir\u02c7\u00ed Wolker will get a great deal more of it than you, because he wanted to achieve something, while all that you want to do is lament.\"30\n\nHalas replied to Neumann in an open letter published in the Rozhledy paper. First of all, he protests against Neumann's questioning his right to use the salutation comrade: \"Comrade Neumann. . . . I have to defend the word, which is so dear to me, and I don't think that only a membership card gives a person the right to use it.31 One cannot be expelled from one's faith, where the only arbiter is conscience and awareness. The measuring of leftism and orthodoxy, so commonly encountered in caf\u00e9s and sectarian sessions, concerns me.\"32 Halas attacks Neumann for his activities fifteen years previously in the C\u02c7erven magazine: \"Perhaps you also found out that 'the red raspberries had not ripened yet'\u2014if I can quote your own words, with which you commented on Wolker's poetry in C\u02c7erven's correspondence column.\" Halas denies initiating the whole discussion \"merely for the benefit of those who see poetry differently.\"33\n\nHalas's article spoke against Wolker's cult of a bourgeois poet. Still, the article provoked a response from representatives of the official line of the KSC\u02c7 (Teige), \"independent\" followers (Neumann) as well as the \"opposition\" (Hora), all of whom saw the article as an attack on them and also a pretext for an attack against those leftist writers who openly disagreed with the principle that only members of the KSC\u02c7 are communists. The discussion on Wolker is only an example which shows that the first half of the 1930s was filled with disputes between writers belonging to the official line of the KSC\u02c7 and \"reformist\" writers, which mirrored the disputes between the KSC\u02c7 and its opposition made up of former communists.\n\nNotes\n\n1. The definition of working class roots is very unclear. In the communist press and literature we can come across a claim that working class roots depend on whether the parents were or are workers. The question remains of how to address the so-called working intelligentsia. In my opinion, the term working class roots was only used for purposeful manipulation and labeling of enemies.\n\n2. S. K.

All attempts by the Communist Party to establish contact or cooperation with other left-wing parties had failed. The strict measures of the concentration governments against extremist parties on both the left and right of the political spectrum led communists to use semi-legal as well as illegal activities.1 Despite this fact, in the mid-1930s the Communist Party becomes an important factor on the Czech political scene, significantly affecting both the domestic and foreign policy of the state. The reason for such turnover was the rise of fascism (Nazism) not only in Germany, but also its gradual spread into other countries near the Czechoslovak border and virtually all across Europe.\n\nChanges in the practical politics of the Communist Party occurred very slowly and only based on the directives of the Comintern. Therefore, immediately after Hitler's rise to power in Germany, the criticism of Czechoslovak communists all the more targeted social democrats.2 The Comintern urged all its national sections to come together in the struggle against the emerging fascism, but at the same time it welcomed it, the reason for which was the ideological conviction that Hitler's regime was only a temporary phenomenon which would cause the radicalization of the political climate in Europe and eventually would help the Comintern achieve its goals. From this point of view, the attack on the reformist parties seems logical\u2014reformists represented the biggest competition in the fight to win over the proletariat. \"Social fascists\" thus became the subject of an unscrupulous campaign, in which the communists did not hesitate to compare social democrats to German fascists.\n\nThe exception was the previously mentioned group around J. Guttmann, which tried to push the idea of a temporary truce and collaboration among all left-wing parties in the struggle against the threat of fascism. However, this group was silenced, while the position of the German Communist Party, which significantly participated in the dissolution of the democratic regime of the Weimar Republic, was presented as exemplary Bolsheviks. For example, one of the KSC\u02c7's main ideologists, V. Kopeck\u00fd, denounced Guttmann and his ideas in the last issue of the Komunistick\u00e1 revue, in an article symptomatically entitled \"Following the Example of the Bolshevik Communist Party of Germany.\" According to Kopeck\u00fd,\n\nGuttmann's views and his criticism of the Communist Party of Germany were . . . unanimously rejected and even denied in the final speech of comrade Gottwald [at the twelfth plenary session of the Executive Committee of the Communist International], but the mistake was that this denial was not made sufficiently clearly known to the entire party. This would have prevented what followed\u2014that some comrades, Guttmann in particular, supported the resolution of the twelfth plenary session only formally, but in fact stuck to their own views and continued to push them.3\n\nGuttmann, who at that time was still a member of the KSC\u02c7, is labeled by Kopeck\u00fd as a Trotskyist. This label, which I will explain later, can be encountered in communist terminology quite frequently after 1933. Being called a Trotskyist meant a definitive excommunication from the communist movement and being added to the blacklist of the biggest enemies of the Soviet regime.4\n\nIn 1933, Guttmann and others began to point out the discrepancy between the official ideological rhetoric of the Communist International's leaders and the practical politics of the Soviet Union. \"Stalin began to push the theory of socialism in one country, on the other hand, the Trotskyist opposition promoted its concept of so-called permanent revolution and its 'export' to the world.\" The Soviet leaders, among whom Stalin gradually eliminated his competitors and concentrated all the power in his hands, were particularly afraid of the possibility of an alliance of western democracies and Hitler's Germany and their joint attack against the Soviet Union. As a result of this fear, Soviet foreign policy changed. The Soviet Union removed Germany from the League of Nations and began to conclude allied contracts directed against Germany's expansionist tendencies.5\n\nIn 1934, official collaboration with Czechoslovakia was established. \"It consisted of the exchange of important information and mutual political support. Czechoslovak Minister of Foreign Affairs Bene\u0161, as chairman of the Council of the League of Nations, actively prepared the accession of the Soviet Union to the League of Nations, which was finalized in the fall of 1934.\"6 The Czechoslovak Republic acknowledged de jure the existence of the Soviet Union shortly before the parliamentary election in Czechoslovakia (May 16, 1935). After that, a Czechoslovak-Soviet agreement on mutual cooperation was signed, which confirmed the warming of relationships between the two countries. According to E. Bene\u0161, the agreement, bound to similar agreements concluded between the Soviet Union and France on the one hand, and France and the Czechoslovak Republic on the other, meant the foundation of collective security in Europe.7\n\nThe parliamentary election on May 19, 1935 confirmed the rise of right-wing extremism. The political scene in Czechoslovakia was practically divided into two Blocs\u2014the Pro-democratic Bloc, represented by the government parties and gradually supported also by the KSC\u02c7, and the Fascist Bloc. Thanks to the strong, authoritarian and almost fascist-oriented wing in the Republican (Agrarian) Party, there was no clear borderline between these two Blocs. The election resulted in victory by the existing government coalition, although the strongest party following the election was Henlein's Sudetendeutsche Partei, which gained 15.2 percent of the vote. The KSC\u02c7 gained 10.3 percent of the vote, which was a similar election result to that in 1929. The electoral increase of one percent represented no more than 100,000 votes. KSC\u02c7 lost support mainly among German voters; on the other hand, it saw the biggest success in Subcarpathian Ruthenia, where the Communist Party gained about 25 percent and thus became the strongest party in the region.8\n\nFrom the point of view of the subject matter of this publication, we cannot help but mention the campaign waged prior to the parliamentary election in the communist press Hal\u00f3 noviny. It was a survey called \"Why I will vote for the communist party,\" whose respondents were prominent personages from cultural life. Writers expelled from the KSC\u02c7 in 1929 also joined the campaign, for example, S. K. Neumann explained his choice saying that \"they are the only consistent force fighting against fascism of all colours and for the Soviet Union.\" Similar reasons are also given by I. Olbracht, M. Pujmanov\u00e1, V. Vanc\u02c7ura, and V. Nezval. They all see the only alternative in the struggle against fascism, that is, the Soviet Union, and claim that the postwar liberal democratic regimes in Western Europe are to blame for this situation. Among the culprits of these events they also included the socialist parties of the government coalition, which opposed the Communist Party.\n\nThe new Czechoslovak concentration government, formed on June 4, 1935, was similar to the previous government. The post of prime minister was again taken by J. Malypetr, a representative of the moderate wing in the Republican (Agrarian) Party. The democratic character of the republic was thus maintained; however, this government was not to last long. In November of 1935, the right wing of the Republican Party, represented by Rudolf Beran, gained the upper hand. The moderate Malypetr was replaced as prime minister by Milan Hod\u017ea. Following the subsequent abdication of President Masaryk, Minister of Foreign Affairs Bene\u0161 also left the government when he accepted the candidacy for president. In the vote, where the right-wing parties nominated as their candidate B. Ne\u02c7mec, the KSC\u02c7 supported Bene\u0161's candidacy.9\n\nWhen in the subchapter's title I used the word positive in quotation marks, what I meant was the discrepancy between the undoubtedly positive moves of the KSC\u02c7 in the period of the fascist threat to the republic on the one hand, and the revolutionary rhetoric on the other. The two sides of the party's activity did not reach harmony until after the seventh congress of the Communist International, which was held in Moscow between June 25 and August 20, 1935. This congress approved a new political line for the international communist movement, whose foundation was the creation of a unified popular front against fascism. The strategy of the struggle against fascism and the immediate goals of the movement were reevaluated. The fight for the dictatorship of the proletariat was replaced as the Comintern's immediate goal with the fight against fascism. According to the new program, power was not to be assumed by the proletariat, but \"it was first supposed to be a government of all antifascist forces on the eve of the victory of the socialist revolution.\"10 Immediately before the presidential election, B. meral conveyed this change of position to the central committee of the KSC\u02c7. According to his speech, \"the party must concentrate on the defense of democracy and the independence of the Czechoslovak Republic against Hitler.\"\n\nDespite the warming relations with the democratic forces in Czechoslovakia and despite all the positive announcements toward the reformist parties, the KSC\u02c7 continued with its independent politics, whose final goal was the assumption of power. Proof of this is the Comintern's stand on the issue of so-called popular fronts, in which communists were to join forces with reformists in the fight against fascism. The Comintern consistently insisted that the leading role in the popular fronts must be played by communist parties.11 This trend within the KSC\u02c7 became evident following the return of the party's chairman, K. Gottwald, released under the amnesty, to Czechoslovakia at the beginning of 1936. Gottwald criticized the current verma leadership for overly converging with the domestic Czechoslovak regime and with reformist parties, particularly the social democrats. At the plenary meeting of the central committee of the KSC\u02c7 in February of 1936, he said that the party \"had succumbed to the tendency of diminishing the difference between the communist politics of the class struggle and the social democratic politics of class peace.\"12\n\nSimilar tendencies which relativized the positive politics of the KSC\u02c7 also showed at the seventh congress of the party, held between April 11 and 14, 1936. The whole congress was organized in an antifascist spirit. Former members of Henlein's party wore sackcloth and ashes and praised the advantages of internationalism. The congress once again denounced J\u00edlek and Bolen's \"sectarian leadership.\" Also openly discussed at the congress was the \"Trojan horse\" tactic in gaining new members and followers of the KSC\u02c7, both in trade unions and directly in other political parties. Party chairman Gottwald spoke of another great danger for the communist movement, Trotskyism, which \"had to be rooted out.\" The main resolution of the congress was the definition of the so-called popular front, which under the supervision of the KSC\u02c7 was to be the only organization of antifascist fighters in the country.13 This ineradicable feeling of exclusiveness, which coincided neither with the real political situation nor with the position and the support of the Communist Party, can be marked as the borderline of positive politics of the KSC\u02c7.\n\nEn Route to Socialist Realism\n\nIn the previous chapter I talked about the dispute between supporters of socialist realism as the only acceptable art form of the communist movement (Gorkij, Zhdanov) and advocates of the plurality of art forms (Bukharin). The seventh congress of the KSC\u02c7 showed that the surrealist group, which until then had been tolerated in the communist movement, found itself on the edge and in danger of excommunication. What happened was that the congress leaned toward socialist realism at the expense of surrealism; however, surrealism fits in the wider discussion on socialist realism, which I am about to describe in more detail.\n\nThe discussion on socialist realism and surrealism in Czechoslovakia is practically one and the same as these were the two most important streams within the Left Front. Communist critics tried to prove that only the art of socialist realism, that is, art about and for the proletariat, art connected with politics, could be considered communist art. On the other hand, the main ideologist of surrealism, K. Teige, opposed that with his own vision of progressive art. His defense of surrealism was based on the belief that \"just as a revolutionary's job is to build things up in the Soviet Union and wreak destruction in the West, art in the West must also provide support against the enemy reality, it must have a destructive, surrealist form.\"14 According to Teige, there is no need to understand modern artwork, it affects us directly by a so-called short connection. Both the spectator and the reader must become coauthors and finishers of a work of art, they must eliminate all obstacles of the mind and conventions. Teige sees the reason why modern art leaves people cold in the wrong attitude of man to artwork and his tastes, spoiled by bourgeois trash. In Teige's opinion, people must be educated to appreciate modern art. He never fails to emphasize that all works of surrealism are a tribute to Marx, whose materialist dialectics prepares us to \"overcome the pre-history of mankind.\"\n\nIt is clear that surrealism had nothing in common with proletarian art as the communist leadership understood it. However, as long as Teige professed Marxism and based his reasons on theoretical quibbles, the KSC\u02c7 could not really intervene. In the speeches of the party's representatives, we encounter open criticism of surrealists, particularly in connection with their weak involvement and the minor impact of their works on the proletariat. For example, V. Kopeck\u00fd spoke against the surrealists in his speech at the seventh congress of the KSC\u02c7.\n\nWe must not uncritically applaud every form of 'leftism' in culture and art. There is an unhealthy form of leftism, which drives masses of people away, and which might very well cause the left to get sidetracked instead of getting to lead the nation. This type of leftism sends masses into the arms of the fascists, who under this kind of 'leftism' have a free hand with their demagogy that follows up on folk elements, ignored by the leftist art, and thus can incite people against true leftist culture, against truly leftist intellectuals and artists in general.\n\nWe, communists, do not wish to order artists so far as what form of expression and artwork to use, but what we are saying is that we would be happy if some poets and writers tried to do more for the popular front by searching for inspiration in the healthy mind of the people instead of the questionable subconscious mind.15\n\nIn his speech, Kopeck\u00fd pointed out as an example of cheap folk art S. K. Neumann and Osvobozen\u00e9 divadlo (Liberated Theater with Jan Werich and Jir\u02c7\u00ed/George Voskovec).16\n\nThis evaluation of the role of art as a means of gaining as many followers as possible could be disputed. Today, we know that official fascist or Soviet art used similar promotional methods. The question of the impact of such art on the \"masses\" can be relativized, but the then KSC\u02c7 leadership did not see the issue from the distance that we have and supposed that surrealism was not an art form which could bring new members to the KSC\u02c7. The question is if any kind of art can in fact bring new members to a political party, or whether this can be credited to individual charismatic artists who in their political activity support some political movement.\n\nBecause of their membership in the party and the Left Front, and thanks to Teige's power of argumentation, for a long time surrealists could officially claim to be part of the cultural policy of the KSC\u02c7. Their contribution for the benefit of communist art was insignificant. They took part in events supporting the Spanish Republic, congresses defending culture in 1935 and 1938, and they publicly claimed their loyalty to the KSC\u02c7. In the surrealism anthology, which was published in February of 1936, Nezval described the situation of surrealism in Czechoslovakia rather optimistically: \"We are pleased, both for ourselves and for the politics of the KSC\u02c7, that no major or long-lasting misunderstanding occurred between us. . . . In Prague, sooner than anywhere else, professional politicians as well theoreticians of dialectical materialism acknowledged the revolutionary significance of surrealism and its art work.\"17 This proclamation came only two months before Kopeck\u00fd's speech at the seventh congress of the KSC\u02c7, in which socialist realism became the official line of communist art, and it was only a matter of time and the right excuse before the party intervened against the surrealist group within the Left Front. Meanwhile, a strict campaign by communist critics continued against the surrealist group.\n\nThe Blok Group\n\nIn 1936, next to the Left Front appears another cultural formation, which attempts to unite the splintered leftist cultural communities. The group was called Blok (trans. Bloc), which in February of 1936 starts, under the editorial supervision of B. V\u00e1clavek, L. Jilemnick\u00fd, and J. Noha, publishing its own quarterly, called U. In their proclamation, the group declares the effort to develop \"to the full extent those creative perspectives that were foreshadowed, among others, also by the congress of Soviet writers two years before and the Paris congress of writers for the defense of culture against fascism the year before.\"18 The group embraces the idea of socialist realism and attempts to reunite all pro-communist cultural workers based on a unified art form. The list of signatories19 suggests that the Blok had close ties with the Left Front and the KSC\u02c7 (particularly B. V\u00e1clavek, J.V. Pleva, and J. Taufer). Its attempt at the collectivization of leftist culture was directed mainly against the surrealist group.\n\nIn his evaluation of the situation in Czechoslovak literature at the time, which was published as the feature article of the first issue of the U revue, B. V\u00e1clavek attempts to analyze the dissension in the left-wing cultural community. He claims that poetists\n\nalso always kept an essentially materialist perception and the feeling of a great historical turning point, which tainted all revolutionary literature after the war. In the subsequent years of social reaction, both streams\u2014proletarian literature and poetism\u2014were shattered and their individual representatives gradually left the fighting front. There were personal disputes, related to the return to the old individualism of self-pity, other times it was the loss of a clear perspective that the world is headed for socialism.20\n\nAccording to V\u00e1clavek, the cause of the dissension in leftist art is the retreat from artistic collectivism, represented by new art styles that put an emphasis on individuality. The main style of these was surrealism, which V\u00e1clavek, though indirectly, attacks.\n\nNot art production for art production itself, but such production which contributes to the grand work of finally liberating mankind from the dominion of nature and from the dominion of exploiters, and also to the work of the never-ending development of human body and soul. . . . New synthetic [meaning collectivized] art is born today by hundreds and thousands of acts. It is alive and part of the activity of that social front of today, which fights for life and its development; an activity manifested by a special art form [social realism]. Those who formed the Blok group as well as its magazine have devoted all their strength to serving this new art form.21\n\nThus, V\u00e1clavek drew a clear line between artists who adhered to communism and its enemies.\n\nThe close ties between Blok and the KSC\u02c7 became absolutely clear in the second issue, which mentioned the names of other artists who had joined the group. The list includes S. K. Neumann, I. Olbracht, M. Majerov\u00e1, and M. Pujmanov\u00e1.22 S. K. Neumann joined the discussion on synthetic (collectivized) leftist art by writing an article entitled \"Blok\u2014The Way I See It.\" According to Neumann, what needs to be done first and foremost is to unite socialist art production.\n\nI think that after the experiences from the past ten years, it is possible to achieve today what was not achieved during the time of so-called proletarian poetry. Both the views and the means of expression of socialist art production are more profound now. . . . It is clear today that he who is skilled in production should produce, and if it is necessary today to fight on all fronts, then he should also fight by means of his production. However, it is the hardest way to fight, much harder than by articles, polemics, manifestos, etc.23\n\nBy elevating socialist art production as the hardest way of fighting, Neumann once again confirmed his elitist views, of which he could not free himself.\n\nIn the third issue of the U magazine, published in October of 1936, we can find two very fierce attacks on surrealism by K. Jir\u02c7\u00edc\u02c7ek and L. Svoboda. In his article entitled \"On the Issue of Surrealism,\" Jir\u02c7\u00edc\u02c7ek contemplates on the influence of surrealism on leftist art and concludes that \"the core of reactionary influence of the individualist theory of surrealism as well as the reactionary aspect of its practical effects lies in wanting to fully lean on fantasy; on a component of the human psyche, which not only does not exist isolated from the rational conscience, but which in comparison to the rational mind represents a lower stage of development, an archaic element.\"24\n\nAfter Jir\u02c7\u00edc\u02c7ek's theoretical contemplation comes a frontal attack by L. Svoboda in his review of A. Breton's book Position politique du Surr\u00e9alisme. According to Svoboda,\n\nsurrealists often and loudly proclaim that they walk hand in hand with the revolutionary proletariat and that they also accept Marxist-Leninist philosophy. There can be no doubt about that, says Breton. What he claims, at all times and with due emphasis, is that he finds unacceptable much of what is declared by the official representatives, both Soviet and foreign, in matters pertaining to cultural policy. Everything that happens on the cultural front in the Soviet Union and is then \"unreasonably spread\" also to other countries is a big misunderstanding. He considers the cultural policy of the Soviet Union unfortunate and even futile, as shown by the cultural development there. He speaks particularly harshly against the current political regime of the USSR, mainly driving at the \"servitude\" not only to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, but directly to one person\u2014Stalin.25\n\nSvoboda thus brings up a topic which meant a definitive split not only of the Czechoslovak, but also the world cultural left in the second half of the 1930s. The topic was the cult of personality developed around J. Stalin, built upon bloody political purges in the Soviet Union, on which neither the cultural left nor the majority of democratic politicians and artists under the fascist threat managed to take a clear disapproving stand. It was the surrealists who were the most vocal critics of Stalinism within the communist movement. These were mostly prominent artists and cultural personalities, whose opinion had relevance and who represented a real threat for the Comintern. Their \"Trotskyist views\" were therefore resolutely rejected by the Comintern and its sections, and surrealists were ousted from the communist movement.\n\nNotes\n\n1.

While previously the Soviet regime was considered to be immoral, undemocratic, and tyrannical, following Stalin's diversion from the idea of exporting the revolution to the theory of socialism in one country, the perception of an aggressive Bolshevik regime changed in the eyes of many observers to a friendly acceptance. This was very noticeable also on the Czechoslovak political and cultural scene. Czechoslovakia's orientation toward the Soviet Union, supported by the mutual agreement from 1935, aroused in a large number of politicians, publicists, and artists an attitude oscillating between uncritical admiration, false hope, and reverent restraint in the criticism of the domestic political situation in Soviet Russia. Z. Kalandra aptly described this atmosphere when he wrote: \"Some friends of the Soviet Union look at this country as if it were a greenhouse that must beware of any stones that could be thrown at its sides by an enemy. In its defense, they could get the idea that the regard for the existence and the needs of the USSR limits the possibilities of our revolutionary maneuvering.\"1\n\nAs a leftist intellectual, identifying himself with Lenin and Liebknecht's legacy, Kalandra was unable to cope with the inner transformation in the Soviet Union and the communist movement. He considered Stalin's policy a retreat from revolutionary ideas and during the 1930s he repeatedly pointed out the discrepancy between the Soviet theory and the practices of the Bolshevik regime. Kalandra was convinced that the rigidity of the Soviet regime and the postponement of the world revolution were the biggest danger that played into the hands of fascism. Therefore, according to Kalandra, the idea that the Soviet Union as the main guardian of world peace against fascism must not be criticized in order not to threaten its stability was a mistake. \"The Soviet Union is not a greenhouse but a stronghold; it is not the brake of our possibilities but its engine.\" Kalandra considered the uncritical attitude to the change of political direction in the Soviet Union a step in the wrong direction, but his approach aroused very little interest and Kalandra became the target of criticism not only by communist, but also noncommunist publicists.2\n\nDuring this time, from the mid-1930s, a political purge was taking place in the Soviet Union, which affected hundreds of thousands of members of the Bolshevik party and millions of inhabitants. By means of these purges, Stalin got rid of most of the high-ranking functionaries who had helped establish the Soviet regime (Zinovev, Kamenev, and others) and practically became the sole ruler of the Soviet empire with unlimited power. The position on the politically motivated trials, whose main target, L. D. Trotsky, had lived in exile from 1929, represented a differentiating mark in the world as well as the Czechoslovak left, political and cultural, and in the end brought about a definitive dissension in the artistic avant-garde. \"The Moscow trials and their perception became a great trauma for the Czech inter-war left. . . . For the first time since the bolshevization of the KSC\u02c7 in 1929, the party intellectuals faced a major inner dilemma between the course dictated by the Soviet leadership and their own fundamental free-mindedness, which meant a forced departure from the communist movement.\"3\n\nThe political trials that took place in the Soviet Union remained veiled in mystery for a long time. This was caused mainly by the lack of credible and undistorted information. If there was someone who was at least partially informed about the trials, it was the leftist artists. Artists sympathizing with the Soviet Union4 met at fancy parties in the Tereza villa in Prague, the seat of the embassy of the Soviet Union in Czechoslovakia. These parties were organized by the ambassador, Alexandrovskij, who in 1938 became a victim of the purges himself.\n\nThe first negative reactions to the Moscow trials came already in 1935. I mentioned Svoboda's criticism of Breton's book, Position politique de Surr\u00e9alisme. In the book, Breton criticized the cultural policy of the Soviet Union, which persecuted avant-garde artists. One of the first people to protest against the trials in Czechoslovakia was Z. Kalandra. As Tvorba's editor-in-chief, he spoke out against Moscow's leadership of the Comintern and its policy. He accused Spanish communists of a coup, the Bolshevik party of betraying the international revolution, and the KSC\u02c7 of betraying Leninism. He also spoke on behalf of those accused in the Moscow trials. Kalandra's views resulted in his being accused of Trotskyism and the cancellation of his membership in the KSC\u02c7.\n\nFollowing his split with the communist movement, Kalandra became a fierce critic. He based his criticism of Stalin's policy and the policy of the KSC\u02c7 on Lenin's convictions, which in many ways were identical to those of Trotsky, who lived in exile at the time. Together with the earlier excommunicated J. Guttmann, in September of 1936 Kalandra published an article entitled \"Odhalen\u00e9 tajemstv\u00ed moskevsk\u00e9ho procesu\" (Mysteries of the Moscow Trial Revealed).5 According to its authors, the only aim of the processes is \"Stalin's attempt at terrorizing Leninist revolutionaries and scaring all honest communists around the world who do not identify themselves with the anti-Leninist direction of the Comintern. . . . The opposition, gathered under the flag of the new International,6 is to be drowned in dirt and blood.\"7\n\nGuttmann and Kalandra criticize the Soviet Union's policy in Spain and France, as well as its internal Soviet policy, particularly the adoption of the new constitution, which limited the powers of the soviets. \"The old doubts about the correct policy of the seventh congress have changed into a conviction of its insincerity and destructiveness. Each new move by people like Thorez, Diaz, and Gottwald on their social patriotic path steps up the discontentment of ordinary members of communist parties.\"8 The authors also criticize the top representatives of the KSC\u02c7, who advocate the Moscow trials as a way of reckoning with the criminal elements that were threatening Stalin's life, and point out the apparently enforced confessions of all the accused:\n\nIn Rud\u00e9 pr\u00e1vo paper Jan verma \"proves\" that the confessions of the accused are the best proof of their guilt. It is surprising that such \"proof\" should be supported by verma, who so many times before \"pleaded guilty\" under the much more subtle terror of the Comintern's bosses and admitted to doing things he had never done and repented for sins he had never committed. Jan verma knows well how things are run in Moscow. That is exactly why he lends himself as a tool of Stalin's deceit: he prefers his wages to Bolshevik honesty.9\n\nAt the end of the article, Guttmann and Kalandra support the ideas of Trotsky and the Fourth International.\n\nThe Moscow trials aroused doubts also among leftist artists. Mainly Karel Teige, who was well informed about the persecution of avant-garde artists in the Soviet Union, did not hide his skepticism about the legitimacy and legality of the trials. Teige's doubts were supported by V. Nezval, who in early September of 1936 wrote to Teige: \"I have a feeling that we both see it the same way.\"10\n\nA major dissension among communist intellectuals was caused by A. Gide's book, Return from the USSR. In 1936 Gide visited the Soviet Union and gave a realistic account of the situation in that country. He wrote: \"I saw the best and also the worst of the USSR.\" Gide's criticism was directed mainly against the political trials, which avoided no one, not even the top communist elite.\n\nS. K. Neumann quickly reacted to Gide's accusations with his \"anti-book,\" Anti-Gide, or Optimism without Superstitions and Illusions. In his book, S. K. Neumann, not knowing the real situation in the Soviet Union, avoids any kind of evaluation of the political situation there and defends the country not based on reality, but using ideological phrases about the first workers' state, the most democratic system of government, and so on. There are also signs of skepticism, when Neumann writes that life in the Soviet Union may not be perfect but the ideas the Soviet regime is built upon are undoubtedly correct. Neumann directed his ideological criticism against everyone who disagreed with the Comintern's trend, but who claimed to be part of the communist movement. Such people he labeled Trotskyists and considered Trotskyism as a \"revolt of the intelligentsia against the people, miniature Gide-ism and mass Kalandra-ism.\"11 Neumann, just like the others, lacked information but made up for it with ideological obedience. Any doubt about Stalin and the Soviet Union would have been unacceptable for him. We need to emphasize that virtually all reactions to the trials were only speculative, not fact-based. Teige, Kalandra, and others at least speculated\u2014and doubted\u2014however, the majority of leftist intellectuals uncritically defended the political trials.\n\nNeumann's Anti-Gide provoked a fierce exchange of opinions among leftist intellectuals. The book was unequivocally welcomed by the orthodox communist critics gathered in the Tvorba magazine, for example, L. toll.12 On the other hand, the book was rejected by Kalandra and also Kamil Bedn\u00e1r\u02c7, who accused Neumann of \"just showing his individual path from anarchism to bolshevism.\" In January of 1937, the Pr\u02c7\u00edtomnost magazine initiated a discussion on the political trials in the Soviet Union. Apart from Kalandra, Gide's critical book was also defended by Guttmann. On the other hand, Z. Nejedl\u00fd took the opposing stand by accusing Gide of publishing his objections to the Soviet Union only after his return.\n\nGide's book and Neumann's reaction aroused a strong reaction also inside the Blok group. Mainly B. V\u00e1clavek accepted with enthusiasm Neumann's Anti-Gide.\n\nExtremely important is Neumann's persuasive account of the communists' relationship with democracy, who sincerely defend the democratic republic against fascism as the best form (of government) for the proletariat in capitalism (Lenin), but knowing its weaknesses, they strive to replace formal liberal democracy with a higher form of proletarian democracy, the transition stage to which is left, revolutionary democracy. Everyone with a sincerely democratic leaning is pushed by fascism to this form of democracy. . . . A higher form of democracy, democracy for the majority of the people, is implemented in the USSR today. The process of development from formal to proletarian democracy takes place around the whole world and its connection with the first proletarian state is evident.13\n\nIn his article, V\u00e1clavek (perhaps not knowingly) admits to what I pointed out at the beginning of this chapter, which is that ever since the USSR joined the antifascist, \"democratic\" camp, criticism of the Soviet Union had been considered unacceptable.\n\nInside the Blok, only one of the three editors, J. Noha, stood by Gide. Noha objected to the distasteful campaign which the communist press waged against Gide. \"During his stay in the Soviet Union, Gide dared to see, and what's worse, when he came back, he dared to write what he had seen. And what happened was that the European as well as the Soviet press turned the 'representative spirit of mankind' into a naive, conceited and selfish individual, an incompetent babbler and a homosexual.\"14 Noha subsequently joins the anti-Stalinist trend in the world communist movement:\n\nI didn't know that A. Gide was a Trotskyist . . . but now I know that a Trotskyist is anyone who looks for the bloody questions the Soviet Union asks us every day. Now I know that a Trotskyist is he who looks for the Fourth International in the lead of the world's working class, who is concerned by questions such as who is responsible for the defeat of the Chinese revolution, the German proletariat and later the murder of the Spanish revolution. Are these facts and experiences not appalling? Is the faith that you [meaning S. K. Neumann] prescribe to young people enough: \"Stay calm and keep your faith that in the end it will be mankind that will win, not its parasites.\"15\n\nNeumann replied to Noha's criticism in the same issue of the U magazine. He tried to prove that Trotsky had never been a true communist and had joined the \"revolution at the last moment (in August of 1917).\"16 According to Neumann, Trotsky had always been a hateful opponent of Lenin, whom he considered to be a \"professional exploiter of the working-class movement.\" Neumann concludes by saying that \"the first real staff of the October revolution, elected on October 10, 1917, based on Lenin's recommendation, were: Stalin, Sverdlov, D\u017eer\u017einskij, Bubnov, and Urickij. Against the revolution were Trotsky, Zinovev and Kamenev.\"17\n\nNoha's defense of A. Gide has an aftermath. In the following issue of the U magazine (January 1938), we can read that \"the discussion between Jan Noha and S. K. Neumann was transferred to the inner forum of the Blok group, where almost all of Blok's members took part in it in written form.\"18 At a two-day meeting, held on October 31 and November 1, 1937, the survey's results were evaluated. According to the article, the intra-editorial discussion\n\nwas mostly against the opinions expressed in the Noha\u2014Neumann discussion by J. Hora. . . . As the Blok's general directive, the cultural popular front was passed as well as a unanimous resolution . . . in the future not to publish views either concerning cultural policies or art theory that could threaten the public function of the Blok as the nucleus of the cultural popular front in the area of literary art. The discussion resulted in a change in U's editorial staff, when Jan Noha resigned as editor.19\n\nLater, on December 11, 1938, Jan Noha also announced his departure from Blok. Thus the Blok group proved that in the \"interest\" of the cultural popular front, it had not shied away from politicking similar to that practiced by the official communist press, whether political or cultural.\n\nPosition of the Surrealists\n\nUndoubtedly the most critical and skeptical position among leftist artists not only on the political trials in the Soviet Union, but also on the overall transformation of the goals of the Communist International, was held by the surrealists. In the second half of the 1930s, the most prominent world representatives of this art style strongly criticized the situation in the USSR, both in the area of politics as well as culture and art. Breton, Bu\u00f1uel, and others did not conceal their outrage at the persecutions of old Bolshevik politicians and avant-garde artists. The most complex and fact-based criticism came in the form of the previously-mentioned Gide book, Return from the USSR, which aroused a wave of hysteria in the communist press not only against Gide, but also against surrealism as a whole. In Czechoslovakia, S. K. Neumann took advantage of Gide's artistic affiliation for an attack on surrealism. At the beginning of 1938, Neumann published a critical evaluation of surrealism in the Tvorba magazine, in which he labeled surrealism as a decadent bourgeois movement, which disrupts the unity of the leftist cultural front by being influenced by individualism and Trotskyism. A number of leftist intellectuals opposed this attack, although some of them were not members of the surrealist group themselves, for example, Novomesk\u00fd, Vanc\u02c7ura, and Hoffmeister. K. Teige, leader of the surrealist group, protested against Neumann's criticism most vehemently when he compared the Marxist rejection of surrealism to its suppression in Nazi Germany.20 It was this comparison that was later used as an excuse for \"dissolving\" the surrealist group. Before the group's dissolution, though, the KSC\u02c7, through the statements of its leaders, appeared as if nothing had happened.\n\nTo Hoffmeister's concerns that Neumann's criticism discourages progressive artistic elements from collaborating with the Communist Party, KSC\u02c7 replied through V. irok\u00fd's article in the Tvorba magazine, which, among other things, states:\n\nThe Communist party did little to change its cultural policy and as before\u2014putting emphasis on the development of all the elements of socialist cultural production\u2014it continues to have the most positive approach to all truly progressive elements in art. . . . We have never prescribed how an artist should create, what forms to use, and we are not going to do so in the future either. For us, the decisive thing is what his world view is. . . . But if nowadays every criticism, even substantiated, of our comrades arouses resistance among part of those that Hoffmeister calls progressive elements in art, it is a politically extremely unhealthy phenomenon, which in the end would threaten even the creative power of these very progressive elements. Yes!\u2014such is the answer we can give A. Hoffmeister and all those on whose behalf he posed his question\u2014it would not be right to scare away and discourage artists from the common progressive front only because they search for new forms of artistic expression, but that never occurred to us, communists.21\n\nIn his article, irok\u00fd clearly outlines what was to come. So far, Teige and the surrealist group resisted pressure for their expulsion from the Left Front, and subsequently from the KSC\u02c7, because their deft defense was based on Marxist principles, compared to the artless and cumbersome critique. As it was not possible to remove surrealists on the grounds of art theory, a political reason came in handy.\n\nOn March 24, 1938, by order of the Communist Party, V. Nezval announces in the Hal\u00f3 noviny the dissolution of the surrealist group. The reasons supplied are, among others, the following:\n\nAt a time when this group started to voice such political opinions which I consider, given the role of the Soviet Union and the effort to form a united anti-fascist front, wrong and dangerous, I deemed it my right and my duty to announce the dissolution of the group, for which as its founder and thanks to my activity in the group I have assumed responsibility in the public eye.\n\nAs one of the reasons for the group's dissolution, Nezval also mentioned Teige's comparison between Nazism and communism.22 Nezval admitted his \"mistakes\" by saying that \"at the time of the trials with Zinovev, I was one of those who did not understand the trial. . . . When I recently found out that the members of the group (Teige, tyrsk\u00fd, Toyen, Brouk) did not understand the substance of the Soviet trials, that they did not interpret them as criminal trials, I made the decision to dissolve the group. . . . We must approve even of such acts of the Soviet regime like the death penalties handed out in the Moscow trials.\" On the orders of the communist leadership, Nezval exposed himself to self-criticism, repented and gladly declared the dissolution of the surrealist group, in which he no longer felt comfortable anyway. It did not matter that not only had he not established the surrealist group, but he had never played a major role in it either. For his act, he received praise from the Bolsheviks and strong criticism from the surrealists.\n\nMost members of the surrealist group rejected their \"dissolution\" by Nezval. Quite the contrary, Teige and Toyen announced in the press that Nezval had been expelled from the group. The surrealist group found itself outside the Left Front and the KSC\u02c7, or more precisely, in opposition to these organizations. In his new role as nonmember and Trotskyist, Teige loses his respect for the international communist movement and openly criticizes the Moscow trials. He publishes a brochure called \"Surrealism Against All Odds,\" in which he criticizes just about everybody; Neumann for his book Anti-Gide, Nezval for attempting to dissolve the surrealist group, the communist literary critics for socialist realism.23\n\nOn the cultural left, the excommunication of the surrealist group aroused another discussion on the form of socialist art and obviously also on the political situation in the Soviet Union. While the Left Front had nothing but scorn for the surrealists, the U Blok strove for a more profound analysis of the crisis among Czechoslovak intellectuals. According to an anonymous article in the first issue of the third volume, \"[leftist intellectuals] are disappointed\u2014some because there is still a class struggle going on in the USSR and they are beginning to speak out against its 'goriness.'24 Others accuse the USSR of their own, 'European' defeatism, saying the Soviet Union does not care enough about the rest of the world (mainly Spain).\"25\n\nIn the following issue, Blok responds to Teige's criticism of socialist realism and its ties with the Soviet regime: \"What . . . we must resolutely reject is the assertion that socialist realism and its representatives and supporters in Czechoslovakia are only agents of Soviet culture, as if they did not have their own ideas, as if there were no preconditions for socialist realism in this country and our socialist realism were only an attempt at conforming our cultural efforts to the Soviet directives.\"26 The Blok group\u2014unlike the exclusively Stalinist style of the Left Front\u2014kept a foolish and unreal vision of its independence, but its ideological views were dangerously similar to those of the official communist course.\n\nThe most zealous advocate of Teige's book Surrealism Against All Odds was Z. Kalandra, who believed that Teige's pamphlet was to be understood as an expression against Stalinist reaction. \"Publishing [the pamphlet] is proof that the most conscious part of the artistic and intellectual avant-garde in Czechoslovakia today understands the necessity of waging a war on all efforts at uniformity, on two fronts\u2014against both the conservative academic right and reaction, and also against the cultural policy of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia.\" Kalandra also criticizes the communist critics who \"very well stand out among the other repentant bureaucrats, who in a lecture from 1927 recalled his campaign against poetism, only later\u2014influenced by the Open letter of the Charkov literary conference\u2014to take it back.\"27 Kalandra namely mentions K. Konr\u00e1d, J. Ryb\u00e1k, and L. toll; however, the biggest share of criticism belongs to S. K. Neumann. Nezval also gets his share of condemnation: \"Finally, there is the embarrassing example of V. Nezval, whose most recent pure Stalinist orthodoxy go hand in hand with celebrative poems about the well-known leader of the Czech bourgeoisie28 in one unit of undoubtedly commercial orientation.\"29\n\nAccording to Kalandra,30 the main contribution of Teige's book is in uncovering similarities between the Soviet and Nazi regimes.\n\nThe merit of Teige's book is in entangling the halo above the heads of Czechoslovak Stalinist cultural agents\u2014but its main significance lies in something else. It lies in defending the freedom of artistic and scientific work against the pressure of uniformity, which today comes from both Moscow and Berlin, and where against the Goebbelses and Jezhovs he emphasized the right and obligation of revolutionary intellectuals to explore the territory of cultural reaction by way of Marxist analysis in both the Soviet as well as the western world.\n\nKalandra suggests that surrealists, just as the Trotskyists, found themselves \"between the streams\" looking for a \"third way\" between Hitler and Stalin.31 Unlike the communist critics, Kalandra was convinced that surrealist art could positively affect the masses, although he was partly skeptical as far as the comprehensibility of surrealists' works of art for the general public was concerned.32\n\nI consider Kalandra's most significant discovery, which leads to a natural culmination of this book, to be the disclosure of the naivety and blindness of the majority of the Czechoslovak cultural left in the interwar era, particularly in the 1930s.\n\nSome prominent members of the cultural avant-garde still do not want to see the connection between the cultural and political reaction. They are attacked, whether directly or indirectly, in their production by Neumann-type enforcers of uniformity and therefore cannot be oblivious of the harmful effect of the reactionary Stalinist cultural policy. . . . On the one hand they oppose the persecution of Mejerchold and Pasternak, but on the other hand they condone the executions of Zinovev, Kamenev, Rykov and the raging campaign against comrade Trotsky. It will not be a minor achievement of Teige's book if it contributes to the half-seeing and half-blind finally fully regaining their sight. . . . Those who know the danger of the murky stream of the anti-Leninist, chauvinistic reaction, which spreads around the world from the epicenter of Stalin's bureaucratism, will welcome the voice of the Prague surrealist group as proof that the best of our intellectuals today are clearly heading up the stream.33\n\nThe leftist cultural scene has thus split at the threshold of WWII. In the end, it was only a handful of leftist intellectuals who stood against the current represented by Stalin's practical politics and its advocates not only in Czechoslovakia, but virtually all around the whole democratic world. In Czechoslovakia, it was, for example, F. Bidlo, B. Brouk, V. C\u02c7ern\u00fd, J. L. Fischer, L. Gr\u00f6lich, F. Halas, J. Hora, J. Je\u017eek, Z. Kalandra, V. Kaplick\u00fd, J. Krejcar, F. Kov\u00e1rna, J. Noha, K. Reiner, J. Seifert, J. tyrsk\u00fd, K. Teige, Toyen, and others. These people who found themselves crushed by the system, in which as if there was no good alternative, became the target of unscrupulous criticism, which at the turn of the 1940s and 1950s transformed into professional, if not outright physical elimination.\n\nThe policy of the KSC\u02c7 was similar in nature to the Stalinist theory of the inner enemy and targeted left-leaning critics much more resolutely than the truly anti-Marxist and ant-communist politicians or publicists. Proof of this lies in the contents of the articles on culture and art in the communist press, which instead of defending the position threatened by the arrival of the authoritarian right, if not directly fascism, focused on the criticism and denunciation of \"renegades\" labeled as Trotskyists. An example of such approach is J. Taufer's article entitled \"Karel Teige between the Currents,\" published in the U Blok magazine.\n\nAccording to Taufer, Teige's resistance to the communist movement can be tracked down to the dissension in Deve\u02c7tsil, which\n\nlay in the attitude toward the USSR and the Soviet reality in general. That part of the artistic left which led to surrealism never identified itself with Marxism as a method of thinking to be able to see the Soviet as well as non-Soviet reality in an on-going process.34 At the time of revolutionary transformation, they remained mere me-tooers and only upon the coming of fascism did it become clear that they were incapable of finding new perspectives of development . . . it became evident that mere platonic identification with dialectical materialism does not necessarily mean internalizing it. How this 'me too,' this consent with the dictatorship of the proletariat, gave no indication as to what the artist's whole sentence was going to be. The trials, revealing ever more noticeably the fingers of fascism reaching for the result of the revolution = the USSR, and showing that Trotskyism has long ceased being a faction of the workers' movement and became only a criminal act, the bloody reprisals, which had not been there before, started to scare the nodding artists.35\n\nTaufer concludes with a threat:\n\nTeige's \"against the current\" is a mere peripety in a surrealist tragedy, exposing the dismal remnants of this sect to the position of between the currents, under the slogan of the fight \"against Nazism and the Soviet reaction,\" which means to stand facing the USSR with one's back turned on fascism. Such is the well-known parasitic position of Trotsky and his followers; the real target of their attack is known. May Teige and the others realize that going against the current, which is what they are doing, does not bring progress, but leads to being swept away.36\n\nThe Czechoslovak cultural left was definitively divided into the majority, which went \"with the current\" and the minority, which dared criticize and was to be punished for it. The symbolic end to the interwar avant-garde of the left in Czechoslovakia is the break-up of the \"inseparable\" Nezval-Teige duo, the first of whom obediently joined the line of pro-Stalin artists,37 while Teige held on to his cultural and political views until his death in the early 1950s. He continued to give momentum to the surrealist group in Czechoslovakia even after the communist establishment declared socialist realism as the only acceptable artistic style.\n\nNotes\n\n1.

Historians will probably refer to the dates March 15, 1939 and February 25, 1948. These two days were undoubtedly the turning points which significantly determined further development of Czechoslovakia; however, they are more like symbols of which history is so fond. Fascism and communism began shaping the Czechoslovak political scene much earlier, practically right after the establishment of the independent state in October of 1918.\n\nThe transformation of the political regime in Russia, caused in 1917 by the resistance of people without rights to militarism and the tyranny of the Czarist regime, brought about a wave of revolutionary sentiment in war-stricken Europe, which greatly contributed to ending the war, after which it grew into a number of revolutionary attempts that led to changes in the domestic political situation in many countries. Although the communist ideology proclaimed by the new Kremlin establishment with V. I. Lenin in the lead never took over the government, it significantly affected the thinking of those who, thanks to the democratization by means of their votes, contributed to the formation and shape of political systems in the interwar era.\n\nIn most countries, the communist ideology, promising social justice, which was to be the result of the revolutionary transformation of property and ownership relations, soon attracted a great many supporters. Apart from the poorest classes in society, for whom communism represented a dream of improving often very bad living conditions, the ideas spread by the Moscow headquarters of the Third International were adopted by a number of intellectuals, often from wealthy and influential families. While the first group was driven by material motivation, leftist intellectuals saw in Leninism, which was presented as a modification of K. Marx's ideas to specific historical conditions, mainly a new philosophical trend, which was to become the means to understanding the world following the breakdown of the cohesive cultural tradition at the turn of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, as well as a remedy to the disillusionment caused by the catastrophic war conflict.\n\nThe war and its consequences meant disillusionment for the major part of the population of all countries that participated in the conflict. Not only the defeated, but also the victors paid for the war conflict with disruption of their industry reoriented to arms production and a severe economic crisis, which served as the matrix for the revolutionary sentiment. Russian communists immediately attempted to use these circumstances to export the revolution. The establishment of soviet republics in Hungary, Bavaria, and Slovakia as well as attempts at communist revolution in other countries were warded off only by a concentrated defense and mutual assistance of countries guaranteeing the stability and immutability of the so-called Versailles system, that is, mainly France, Great Britain, and the countries of the Little Entente. The activities of the communist parties that openly called themselves national sections of the Communist International were subjected to strict supervision; in some countries, communist parties were later banned.\n\nApart from communism, the postwar era saw a rise in another totalitarian ideology, also fed by the discontentment of some social classes, the fascist ideology. While supporters of communism saw the changes brought about by the war as insufficient, supporters of fascism turned mainly to the prewar era. While communists wanted to achieve social justice by establishing a classless society, supporters of fascism promoted a corporate model of a political system, which was to be safeguarded by a \"strong government.\" Both totalitarian ideologies were based on a similar collectivist model aimed at creating a seemingly just society ensuring the equality of its citizens, but only those who would fully identify not only with the goals, but also with the methods of the ruling class.\n\nCommunism and fascism in interwar political systems found themselves at the two extremes of the political spectrum and considered each other to be their biggest enemies. It was often a mere rhetorical game and the supporters of the two ideologies concordantly fought against the democratic political parties. Probably the clearest evidence of this is the disruption of the democratic regime of the so-called Weimar Republic.\n\nThe democratic states, which attempted to overthrow the communist regime in Soviet Russia by international intervention, did not manage to oppose with the same vigor the fascist regimes that started to take over European countries as early as the early 1920s. The reason was mainly the conviction of a lesser threat posed by fascism, which was thought to serve as protection for Europe against the dangers of communism. This fallacy, which in the 1930s grew to a shameful and treacherous policy of appeasement, was later paid for dearly by the democratic powers in the form of a shameful alliance with Stalin's Soviet Union and subsequently fifty years of Cold War.\n\nCzechoslovakia was one of the few states that managed to resist both communist as well as fascist pressure during the entire interwar era and change came only from without, against which there was virtually no defense. In spite of this resistance, communist ideology gained relatively major support from the Czechoslovak people in the 1920s and 1930s. Throughout the duration of the first Czechoslovak republic, the Communist Party enjoyed the electoral support of more than 10 percent of voters. Despite its relatively strong position, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia never shed the stigma of an undemocratic and anti-systemic party and during the first republic it never once became a governmental party. Communists were exposed to strong pressure from the repressive bodies of the government and particularly in the first half of the 1930s, they balanced on the brink of legality. Their political activity was banned in December of 1938, that is, during the so-called second republic, whose regime was moving very quickly toward an authoritarian, if not a directly fascist model.\n\nJust as in other countries, also in Czechoslovakia part of the intelligentsia and artists became enthusiastic about the communist idea. This enthusiasm was experienced by people across all generations. While the older generation of artists (S. K. Neumann, J. Hora, and others) approached communism for individualist reasons, influenced mainly by anarchism, representatives of the younger generation leaned toward communism mostly based on collectivist theories of avant-garde artistic styles that already before the war had preached the need for artistic and political revolution, which would bring about the collapse of the existing culture and complete liberation of artistic production.\n\nThis definition of leftist artists in two groups, clearly divided in terms of generation and ideology, cannot be accepted generally and without reservation; on the contrary, I have attempted to describe as precisely as possible all the events and persons that defy the simple definition of the split within the cultural left in this complex process of ideological cleavage. I believe I have managed to present evidence that the hazy term \"collective thinking\" is in reality confronted by individual thinking and also the conscience of an individual. Perhaps the clearest confrontation between collectivism and individuality can be seen in the surrealist group, where the strict organizational rules are confronted by the unfettered artistic individuality of its members.\n\nWhat brought leftist intellectuals together not only in Czechoslovakia was the illusion that historical development can be predicted and thus subsequent identification with communist teachings of the inevitability of a transfer to a classless society. Based on this illusion, leftist artists became enthusiastic advocates of the Soviet regime, about which they usually knew nothing except for what was written in the newsletters and bulletins published by the leadership of the Communist International. This ignorance of the actual conditions was one of the reasons for disagreement among the cultural left.\n\nIntellectuals in the Communist Party stood on its periphery and were considered to be a foreign and suspicious element by many top representatives. In relation to the older generation, this skepticism is characterized by meral's leadership of the anarchism-bred Union of Communist Groups, or by S. K. Neumann, who represented the spiritual leader of this organization. It is paradoxical that it was Neumann who became the leader of the first united cultural organization of the communist party\u2014Proletkult\u2014and also the leading advocate of proletarian art based on the principle of socialist realism.\n\nThroughout the interwar era, Neumann' biggest ideological opponent on the cultural left was K. Teige, who spoke on behalf of avant-garde movements, which professed the independence of art creation from political dictates. The disputes between these two outstanding theoreticians, which went through various stages, in which the communist establishment once backed Neumann and then Teige, show the inconsistency within the party and the entire communist movement. This inconsistency was the result of a fact which the majority of the cultural left did not realize; neither the Soviet leaders nor the leadership of the Communist International ever stuck to a clearly defined ideology, be it Marxist, Leninist, or any other. All modifications to the strategy proclaimed by the Comintern were merely an expression of the adjustment of an otherwise disrespected ideology to the special interests of the Soviet Union, or those of Stalin himself.\n\nA discussion on leftist culture took place in Czechoslovakia without any major interference from the Communist Party until the fifth congress of KSC\u02c7; the majority of disputes of leftist artists and art theoreticians on the form and content of the artwork of a proletarian artist was conducted out of sight of the party leadership, in an atmosphere of a free creative approach. During the 1920s, the Communist Party underwent a process of constant ideological splitting, which occupied it to such an extent that the cultural organization found itself at the bottom of the Communist Party's list of priorities. The first wave of hysteria swept across the permanent discussion on leftist culture and art after the Bolshevization of the KSC\u02c7 in connection with the rejection of this process by seven writers, who until then had been considered to be exemplary proletarian artists. Although, with the exception of Josef Hora, everyone once again clung to the Communist Party and its cultural organizations, the \"pre-bolshevization\" discussion on proletarian art was never resumed. While until the fifth congress of the KSC\u02c7 this discussion was based on academic principles, in the 1930s it continued ever more often to be transformed into mere political campaigning, if not directly a controlled elimination of ideological opponents.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1930s, the voluntary collectivist spirit, which captivated the cultural left in the 1920s, quickly disappeared, to be replaced by the cumbersome Left Front, from which many significant writers either left or their affiliation was only a formal act. The joyous and playful spirit which gave rise to manifestos of proletarian art and poetism was destroyed and gave way to the stiffness and vulgarity of communist critics gathered around the Tvorba magazine.\n\nThe Bolshevized Communist Party immediately began to knowingly take advantage of the militarized intellectual left for its political objectives. Artists were involved in organizing strikes during the time of economic crisis, they participated in press campaigns against their colleagues from the conservative, liberal, and socialist streams, they publicly promoted the policy of the Communist International and denounced all expressions of disagreement, such as Trotskyism. The climax of the abuse of the cultural left at this time was the propaganda in connection with the Spanish civil war, where Soviet foreign policy resigned itself to the tactic of the so-called popular front and pursued purely Russian goals.1\n\nAgainst constant changes to the tactic of the Communist International and the Soviet Union, which in their opinion deformed the original communist ideology, various opposition groups formed both within the Comintern and the KSC\u02c7, the members of which were also leftist intellectuals. This inner opposition was intervened against by individual leaders of the KSC\u02c7 by way of purges and denunciation campaigns. Partisan purges did not spare leftist intellectuals either. As early as in the 1920s, the Communist Party expelled, for example, K. Vane\u02c7k, who was known mainly for his own, embarrassing ending of Ha\u0161ek's The Good Soldier Schweik. It was Vane\u02c7k who together with Ha\u0161ek founded the so-called Jac\u02c7ejka, one of the first Czech communist cells among Austrian deserters of Czech origin.\n\nThe most well-known purge among the leftist intellectuals is undoubtedly the excommunication of the seven writers who in 1929 (temporarily) refused to accept the change in KSC\u02c7 leadership ordered by Stalin. These were people who significantly contributed to the establishment of the Communist Party in Czechoslovakia, mainly S. K. Neumann. I would like to again point out that these were mainly members of the older generation of artists, who based themselves on theories of individualism at the turn of the century, and in some cases directly on anarchism. Their critical position is therefore not surprising; what is surprising, though, is the quick return of the majority of expelled writers under the wings of the Bolshevized party and their further activity. Even such a critical soul as S. K. Neumann joins the distasteful campaigns against the critics of Stalin's bloody methods in the second half of the 1930s.\n\nThe last big prewar purge directed against intellectuals in the Communist Party was the expulsion of surrealists from the Left Front at the beginning of 1938. The official reason for this move was the disagreement of some representatives of Czech surrealism with the political trials in the Soviet Union,2 whose victims were both ordinary people as well as architects of the revolution. The campaign against surrealism was not merely a defense against critics of Stalinist deformations in the communist movement, but also an intervention against an alternative form of communist art production and a definitive confirmation of the method of so-called socialist realism as the only acceptable art form.\n\nIt is symptomatic that until their excommunication, the majority of the expelled were passionate advocates of the Soviet Union and communist ideas. The sobering caused by the discovery of the political intrigue of Stalin and his Czechoslovak followers could not be left without comment by the leftist intellectuals. Perhaps the loudest declaration of his sobering came from K. Teige, who without hesitation compared the methods of fascist Germany to Soviet Russia. Although Teige speaks only of the cultural policy, we cannot ignore the fact that Teige, a former zealous promoter of the Soviet regime and the leading advocate of the Bolshevization of the KSC\u02c7 on the cultural left, managed to perform a profound self-reflection and point out all the detrimental phenomena in the Soviet Union.\n\nCriticism of Stalin's practical politics led most leftist intellectuals to positions that communist journalism referred to as Trotskyism.3 The synonym for this position in Czechoslovakia was Z. Kalandra and on the cultural left the previously mentioned K. Teige. Being a Trotskyist meant disagreeing with the current political development in the Soviet Union, yet still believing in the rightness of communist ideas, which according to Trotskyists were merely distorted. Supporters of this idea were associated with the views of Soviet communist emigrants, whose main representative was L. Trotsky.\n\nIn the second half of the 1930s, swept up by the panic from the fascist threat, criticism of the Soviet Union from both noncommunist and especially communist positions was viewed as something undesirable and harmful. Teige, Kalandra, and others found themselves crushed in the wheels of the system, from which they looked for a third way out. A very convincing account of these \"outcasts\" is given by L. Bu\u00f1uel in connection with the Spanish civil war.4 Statements from the Trotskyist cultural left as well as the practical activities of Trotskyist politicians\u2014again the best example is the involvement of the POUM units in Spain\u2014provide evidence that not only its distorted form but the communist teachings themselves are based on violence. Let us remember Kalandra's statement, in which on the one hand he expresses his doubts about the political trials in the Soviet Union, and on the other hand he clearly states his views:\n\nIf we were still in the fortunate situation that we were for only a few short years, when we could believe the words of the leaders of the official communist party and trust its press, then everything would be perfectly easy. Then the Moscow trials would be about eliminating the terrorist enemies of the USSR who had sunk so deep as to conspire with Hitler, in which case we would all be the first to support the carrying out of the merciless sentences. For we do not condone deceitful bourgeois humanism and we have nothing but scorn for the hypocritical cry of reactionaries over the fate of those deservedly struck by the punishing sword of revolutionary justice.5\n\nSuch is the position of a typical carpet communist, who is the best first step to the establishment of communist concentration camps, if not directly genocide, as was the case in Pol Pot's Cambodia.\n\nDespite all the reservations, the Trotskyists hold one primacy. It was them who loudly and clearly pointed out the fact that the 1930s brought the world to a situation in which there is nothing clear. While the majority of intellectuals\u2014not only on the left, but also liberal intellectuals\u2014rejected any kind of criticism of the Soviet Union as they deemed it indispensable in the struggle against fascism, it was the so-called Trotskyists who pointed out the fact that the world is not black-and-white6 and that one needs to differentiate between individual acts and avoid uncritical admiration of the Soviet regime. However, with this position, they found themselves on the edge, expelled from the cultural left and misunderstood by the majority of other intellectuals.\n\nFollowing the revelation of Stalin's cult and its proclamation as a mere deviation from otherwise unquestionable teachings, there appeared an opinion which admitted the errors\u2014but not criminality\u2014of the political trials in the Soviet Union; however, it still defended the supporters of these trials. According to this statement,7 Teige and other critics of the political trials were right, but they should not have exposed it, because it harmed the communist movement. On the other hand, the leftist intellectuals who defended the trials are presented almost as martyrs; they often knew the trials were illegal and the accusations fabricated, but they still defended the official position of the Stalin-controlled Comintern for the \"higher cause.\"\n\nThe course of WWII and its results allowed Stalin to make at least part of his prewar efforts come true. The Yalta agreement, based on which Europe was divided into power zones, opened the door for the Soviet model into Eastern and Central Europe and granted pan-Russian imperialism its biggest territorial gain in history. The vassal governments made up of members of the Communist Parties were fully subordinated, with a few exceptions,8 to directives from Moscow. Obedience was ensured also by Soviet agents operating in the armed forces of the so-called peoples' democratic and later socialist countries, as well as by the Soviet military presence in these countries.\n\nLeftist intellectuals were actively involved in implementing Soviet methods in the area of culture. The tool for the implementation of these methods in Czechoslovakia was the newly established ministry of information led by the KSC\u02c7's leading ideologist, V\u00e1clav Kopeck\u00fd. The ministry's high-ranking officials were those artists who in the prewar era had shown loyalty to Stalin's politics and its methods. The prewar representatives of many avant-garde artistic movements, V. Nezval, F. Halas, and A. Hoffmeister, held positions of deputy ministers.\n\nMany leftist artists became merely ordinary communist bureaucrats, through whom after 1948 the Communist Party dealt with those who dared to disagree and doubt. Apart from the representatives of other than leftist art forms, mainly literary Catholicism, the cultural policy of the Communist Party after 1948 focused its attention primarily on representatives of the leftist avant-garde art forms, who were often labeled as Trotskyists and tried. Perhaps the most well-known victim from the inter-war intellectual left is Z\u00e1vi\u0161 Kalandra, who was executed in 1950. The spiritual leader of the surrealist group, Karel Teige, died of heart failure in 1951, while awaiting a similar fate. In the same year, Konstantin Biebl committed suicide by jumping from a window. A number of other artists avoided communist reprisals by fleeing the country.\n\nThe pro-Soviet intellectuals and artists, whom in the foreword I called subculture or counterculture, were given a chance to make the eternal dream of avant-gardists true in Czechoslovakia\u2014the political movement for which they provided ideological support took over the government.9 While in the prewar era, as representatives of one, far from dominant movement in Czechoslovak culture, communist intellectuals focused mainly on the politicization of art, in the communist state this activity was transformed into the aesthetization of politics.10\n\nForeshadowing this transformation was the proclamation that socialist realism was the only acceptable method for communist artists which came together with the expulsion of the surrealist group from the Left Front, and its comparison to political Trotskyism. While the representatives of avant-garde art forms, professing the idea of communist revolution, stuck to the position of the politicization of art, whether in the era of proletarian art, poetism, surrealism, or other art forms, socialist realists laid as the main axiom for art production by communist artists the aesthetization of politics. What is paradoxical is that in the communist state, an avant-garde art form was transformed into the leading movement, which stepped down from one of the fundamental principles of avant-gardism by proclaiming itself to be the ultimate art form.11 This feeling of finality is undoubtedly connected with the communist belief in the \"end\" of history, which is to occur with the formation of a communist society.\n\nIf I attempt to expand Bell and Berger's terminology, then socialist realism, which in the prewar era can be viewed as one of the countercultures, in the people's democratic states of the Soviet Bloc after WWII does not just become the official culture, but grows into a sort of a superculture, which suppresses other cultures, pushing representatives of other (sub)cultures into a position bordering on illegality,12 if not directly eliminating them.13 This superculture in a totalitarian system identifies its activity with the needs of the ruling political party, or the elite.\n\nFrom here, there is just one step to a theoretical comparison of communism to the political avant-garde and socialist realism as the cultural avant-garde, which accompanies communism. If we identify ourselves with the statement that the moment when socialist realism became the official, ruling culture, which meant the definitive collapse of avant-gardism, can we similarly think about communism as a political idea? Did perhaps the moment when the Communist Party took over power and its ideology became the official, ruling ideology mean the collapse and emptying of communism?\n\nIt seems that the characteristic feature of the twentieth century, which could be called the century of political and cultural avant-gardisms, is the avant-garde interpretation of politics and culture, which is always based on the idea of superiority and inferiority. Communism, fascism, Trotskyism, nepotism, racism, tribalism, modern nationalism, and other political-isms that apart from politics also put the emphasis on culture, are built on the idea of \"avant-garde\"\u2014class, nation, race, tribe, and so on. If some current advocates of communism claim that the political practice which we knew in Czechoslovakia for more than fifty years was only a distorted and deformed version of the right idea, this opinion needs to be resolutely rejected based on the fundamental axiom of communist doctrine, which is the conviction of a natural supremacy of one social class over others, which is entirely irreconcilable with democratic principles.\n\nNotes\n\n1. The Soviet tactic in Spain is well covered, for example, by F. Furet, who believed that Stalin deliberately tried to prolong the civil war and thus divert the attention of German Nazis from the Soviet Union. Fran\u00e7ois Furet, Minule iluzije. Esej o komunistic\u02c7ni ideji 20. stoletja (Ljublana: Mladinska knjiga, 1998).\n\n2. It would be a mistake to think that K. Teige or the surrealists were the only leftist intellectuals who pointed out the criminality of the Moscow trials. As an example of slightly different criticism, we can mention Josef Hora's autobiographical book Dech na skle (transl. Breath on Glass), published in 1938, in which Hora criticizes the current leadership of the communist movement (\"It is all you. You love the world but hate the people.\") and shows the similarities between Stalinism and fascism. By means of a letter from a fictitious friend, he points out the reality of contemporary life in the USSR:\n\nDear John,\n\nI'm sending a letter through a friend who is going to Prague. It is nice of her, she is very brave. Everyone has turned away from me. Some unthinkable things have happened here. My husband was unexpectedly arrested and taken away, no one will tell me where. He is accused of having ties with the opposition, they accused him of sabotage. I never saw it coming, I still cannot believe it. I cannot cross the border. . . .\n\nGoodbye,\n\nTamara.\n\nThe novel contains a very strong condemnation of the Stalinist form of communism, for example: \"These saviours of the world, whether they be communists or fascists, have more pride than love. They do not care about the poor, about the nation, only about their vain idea about how the poor and the nation should behave.\" Taken from the article \"Horo, Horo, vysok\u00e1 jsi,\" Report\u00e9r 20 (1990/V): 5\u201311 October 1990.\n\n3. Some pro-communist intellectuals, for example, J. Hora, completely turned away from the institutionalized form of communism.\n\n4. \"It was total war. It was out of the question to remain neutral, to support the tercera Espan\u02c7a (third Spain), of which many dreamed at the bottom of their hearts.\" Luis Bu\u00f1uel, Do posledn\u00e9ho dychu (Bratislava: Slovensk\u00fd spisovatel, 1986), 187.\n\n5. Z\u00e1vi\u0161 Kalandra, Intelektu\u00e1l a revoluce (Prague: C\u02c7esk\u00fd spisovatel, 1994), 222.\n\n6. The doubts and uncertainty in the evaluation of events in the second half of the 1930s can once again be illustrated in the position of L. Bu\u00f1uel, who oscillated between support for the Soviet Union and Trotskyism. In his doubts, Bu\u00f1uel even finds understanding for Franco's dictatorship in Spain, although he actively fought against it and finally had to flee the country. \"I have never been a fanatical opponent of Franco. In my eyes, he did not impersonate the devil. Sometimes I toy with the idea that he saved the bleeding Spain from Nazi occupation. As far as my feelings about Franco, they are not entirely unambiguous.\" Bu\u00f1uel, Do posledn\u00e9ho dychu, 207.\n\n7. The statement can be found, for example, in the anthology C\u02c7esk\u00e1 literatura proti fa\u0161ismu (Transl. Czech Literature against Fascism). C\u02c7esk\u00e1 literatura v boji proti fa\u0161ismu (Prague: C\u02c7eskoslovensk\u00fd spisovatel, 1987).\n\n8. It needs to be said that even countries that managed to resist the Soviet influence built their own models of communism on very undemocratic methods. Albanian communists stuck with Stalinist methods until the 1980s, and the Maoist regimes in China and Cambodia also displayed a high degree of brutality. Tito's Yugoslavia represented a special case, which initially copied the Soviet methods, but which from the 1960s adopted a number of democratization measures.\n\n9. Speaking of subcultures and countercultures, we cannot help but mention the era of the so-called second republic, in which a similar chance was given to representatives of literary Catholicism and ruralism.\n\n10. For example, W. Benjamin writes about this phenomenon. Walter Benjamin, Umetni\u0161ko delo v c\u02c7asu tehnic\u02c7ne reprodukcije (Ljubljana: Mladinska knjiga, 1981).\n\n11. D. Rupel called this phenomenon the \"emptying of avant-gardism.\" Dimitrij Rupel, \"Alternativa gibanju v kulturi,\" in Zbornik socialo\u0161kega srec\u02c7anja Neformalne dejavnosti v slovanski druz\u02d8bi (Ljubljani: Center za druz\u02c7benopolitic\u02c7no izobraz\u02c7evanje, 1987, 224.\n\n12. The phenomenon of the underground.\n\n13. In the Soviet Union, this phenomenon can be noticed earlier.\n\n## Bibliography\n\nAvantgarda zn\u00e1m\u00e1 i nezn\u00e1m\u00e1, sv I.
