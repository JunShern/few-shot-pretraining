Gas engine power outputs must be approximately twice the pump power requirements shown above.\n\nWe recommend a 1.15 service factor be specified when selecting an electric motor as the power source. To compute specific pump horsepower requirements use the following formulas:\nElectric HP = (GPM X PSI)/1450\nas HP = (GPM X PSI)/1100\n\n*Engine power varies based on horizontal or vertical orientation, as well as by makes and models from each manufacturer.\n\nREPAIR KITS\n\nITEM#\n\nPART#\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nQty.\n\nPlunger Packing Kit \u2013 Part #09737\n\n33A\n\n08087\n\nGrooved Ring\n\n3\n\n36\n\n06359A\n\nPressure Ring\n\n3\n\n36A\n\n04117\n\nGuide Ring\n\n3\n\n36B\n\n05263\n\nSupport Ring\n\n3\n\n37\n\n06360\n\nSleeve\n\n6\n\n38\n\n13422\n\nSleeve Support Ring\n\n3\n\n39\n\n13424\n\nLeakage Seal\n\n3\n\nValve Assembly Kit \u2013 Part #09738\n\n40\n\n07214\n\nO-Ring\n\n9\n\n44A\n\n06362\n\nTension Spring\n\n6\n\n44B\n\n07283\n\nValve Spring\n\n6\n\n44C\n\n06363\n\nValve Plate\n\n6\n\n44D\n\n06364\n\nValve Seat\n\n6\n\n44E\n\n07035\n\nO-Ring\n\n6\n\nOil Seal Kit \u2013 Part #09577\n\n31\n\n07133\n\nOil Seal\n\n3\n\nRepair Kits Available\n\nThe repair kits listed to the right are available for this pump.
