Pasterjak shows how you can take a few pieces of angled iron, 8 skate wheels, and some miscellaneous nuts and bolts to whip up a 'Ladder Dolly' inspired slider design. He doesn't really mention the words Ladder Dolly, but this design has basically been around for quite a while. Cheap ladder dollies although will still run you upwards of $700 dollars, and that's still missing the $100+ dollar Ladder. His design if being selective of where you choose your parts, in my own head, i'm estimating still falls under the $45 dollar mark and you can get away with just about anything for rails. You can find his DIY video here: DIY Inexpensive Camera Slider.\n\nBelow i've embedded a video from Hague showcasing the layout of wheels used for a Ladder Dolly Design. You can find more information about the Hague here: Video Camera Ladder Dolly System\n\nI built the same thing after I saw this video. It came together pretty easy and it works great. Put a ball head mount on the top of it so you can level your camera and your all set to slide both horizontal and diagonal.\n\nOddly enough, the entire concept of \"Ladder Dolly\" never even entered my rudimentary, reptilian brain. It's like I looked at a panther and a housecat and said \"Those two things are completely different and not related at all and one doesn't even remind me of the other in the least.\"\n\nI mean, I'v used ladder dollies. Had I remembered that, I'd have probably looked back at some design elements. For God's sake, I even USED A TINY LADDER as part of the build at one point."
