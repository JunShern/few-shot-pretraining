    "text": "Dan Kennedy's blog on media and politics \u2022 published by the Boston Phoenix from 2002 to 2005\n\nTuesday, August 31, 2004\n\nNOT BAD FOR A CYBORG. But\nthe nets missed a chance to cut to Dick Cheney when Arnold\nSchwarzenegger said,\n\"And when Nelson Mandela smiled in election victory after all those\nyears in prison, America celebrated, too.\"\n\nCheney, when he was a Wyoming\ncongressman, voted\nagainst a 1986 resolution calling for Mandela to be freed from a\nSouth African prison.\n\nBUSH ON THE COUCH.Newsweek's cover\npiece on George W. Bush\ncontains some mighty telling details about his relationship with his\nfather. Let's cut right to the chase:\n\nMany of Bush's friends, as\nwell as his critics, wonder why Bush failed to consult one\nparticularly experienced and able expert in the field of foreign\naffairs: his father. \"41\" often calls \"43,\" but usually to say, \"I\nlove you, son,\" President Bush told NEWSWEEK. \"My dad understands\nthat I am so better informed on many issues than he could possibly\nbe that his advice is minimal.\" That is a pity, say some old\nadvisers to 41, because 43 badly needed to be rescued from the\nclutches of the neocons, the Defense Department ideologues who, in\nthe view of the moderate internationalists who served in 41's\nadministration, have hijacked American foreign policy.\n\nBut the fact is that President\nBush did not want to be rescued. To say he has a complicated\nrelationship with his father is an understatement. Bush clearly\nadmires, even worships, his father, says a friend who notes that\nBush wept when his father lost political races. But he doesn't\nwant his father's help. To some degree, he is following a Bush\nfamily code. According to family lore, Bush's grandfather Prescott\nrefused an inheritance from his father, while W's dad refused\nPrescott's plea to put off joining the Navy in World War II before\ngoing to college. \"No, sir, I'm going in,\" said the 19-year-old\nGeorge H.W. Bush. In the Bushes' world, real men are supposed to\nmake it on their own, without Dad's looking over their shoulders.\nAfter the 1988 presidential campaign, W was eager to shed the\nnickname \"Junior.\"\n\nBut George W. hasn't just been\nindependent, he's been defiant. The degree to which Bush defines\nhimself in opposition to his father is striking. While 41 raised\ntaxes, 43 cut them, twice. Forty-one is a multilateralist; 43 is a\nunilateralist. Forty-one \"didn't finish the job\" in Iraq, so 43\nfinished it for him. Much was made of 43's religiosity when he\ntold Bob Woodward that \"when it comes to strength,\" he turns not\nto 41, but rather to \"a higher father.\" But what was the president\nsaying about his own father?\n\n...\n\nYou don't have to be Freud or\nSophocles to conjure up some rivalrous or rebellious feelings of\nthe son toward the father. George W. spend much of his early\nyears, and a good deal of his adulthood, trying and failing to\ncatch up to his father as a student, athlete, aviator, businessman\nand politician. When Bush, in a drunken rage at the age of 26,\nchallenged his father to go \"mano a mano\" with him, all his father\ncould say was how \"disappointed\" he was. What could be more\nwounding?\n\nBut that was many years ago.\nBush without question bears scars, possibly serious ones, that\naffect his behavior today. But unlike so many other sons of the\npowerful, he pulled his life together and made some kind of peace,\nor at least truce, with his demons.\n\nWritten by Evan Thomas, Tamara\nLipper, and Rebecca Sinderbrand, the piece - \"The Road to Resolve\" -\nis striking in its willingness to plumb the president's psychology.\nIt seems unlikely that a vanilla publication such as Newsweek\nwould have been willing to publish something that would be so likely\nto piss off the notoriously touchy Bush clan a year ago, when the\npresident was still riding high.\n\nAlso, check out this\nJonathan Alter column on Bush's nasty campaign style, epitomized by\nhis reluctance to dissociate himself from the lying Swifties. Writes\nAlter: \"So much for any sense of decency. The man who was once an\ninept right-wing president but a nice guy is now just an inept\nright-wing president.\"\n\nRUSH SAVES BUSH FROM TRUTH.\nGeorge W. Bush told the truth on Saturday. But don't worry. He's not\ngoing to let it happen again. He made sure of that earlier this\nafternoon in a characteristically fawning interview conducted by\nRush\nLimbaugh.\n\nAs you may recall, the president\nwas asked by Matt Lauer, in an interview\nfor NBC's Today show, whether the US could win the war on\nterrorism. (The interview was broadcast yesterday.) Bush replied: \"I\ndon't think you can win it. But I think you can create conditions so\nthat those who use terror as a tool are less acceptable in parts of\nthe world - let's put it that way.\"\n\nIt was a good, honest answer.\nUnfortunately, it was also at odds with the triumphalism of his past\nremarks. As Elisabeth Bumiller reported\nin today's New York Times, Bush said as recently as July 14,\n\"I have a clear vision and a strategy to win the war on terror.\"\nBumiller went on to write, \"It was unclear if Mr. Bush had meant to\nmake the remark to Mr. Lauer, or if he misspoke.\" Misspoke?\nRe-read what he said. Rarely has he been so honest and\ncoherent.\n\nOf course, Bush's candor was\nimmediately labeled a mistake. It would have been nice if John Kerry\nor John Edwards had jokingly welcomed Bush to the real world. But no.\nEdwards made a stiff statement\ninsisting, \"This is no time to declare defeat. It won't be easy and\nit won't be quick, but we have a comprehensive plan to make America\nsafer.\" (Note that Edwards didn't say that Bush was wrong.) Even\nBush's sycophants on the Fox News Channel said Bush had stepped in\nit, though they tried to explain it away.\n\nSo today ... El\nRushbo to the rescue!\n\"Well, I appreciate you bringing that up,\" Bush - calling in from Des\nMoines, where he was campaigning - told Limbaugh, adding that he\nshould have been \"more clear.\" Bush explained: \"What I meant was that\nthis is not a conventional war. It is a different kind of war. We're\nfighting people who have got a dark ideology who use terrorists,\nterrorism, as a tool.\" And: \"In a conventional war there would be a\npeace treaty or there would be a moment where somebody would sit on\nthe side and say, 'We quit.' That's not the kind of war we're in, and\nthat's what I was saying.\"\n\nAfter talking a bit about his\nconfidence that Iraq and Afghanistan will become \"free nations,\" Bush\nsaid, \"I probably needed to be a little more articulate,\" then\nfollowed up with this: \"I know we'll win it, but we have to be\nresolved and firm, and we can't doubt what we stand for.\"\n\nStill more: \"We're making great\nprogress. Today at the [American] Legion I said\nwe're winning the war on terror, and we'll win the war on\nterror. There's no doubt in my mind.\"\n\nLook, optimism has its place. But\nterrorism is clearly a problem to be contained and controlled. To say\nthat it will be defeated entirely is unrealistic to the point of\nfoolishness. Just ask the Israelis and the British. Bush could have\nfollowed up his remarks to Lauer by expanding on them in order to educate the public. Instead, he\nwent right back to pandering. No surprise there.\n\nBush and Limbaugh went back and\nforth for about 20 minutes, justifying the war in Iraq, engaging in a\nsome light Kerry-bashing, and previewing his Thursday-night\nconvention speech, although only a bit. \"I'm going to save some of it\nfor the speech if you don't mind,\" Bush said. \"You're a good friend,\nand I hate to let you down.\" Replied the groveling Rush: \"I\nunderstand, I understand completely.\"\n\nAs they were closing, Bush asked\nthe longtime OxyContin abuser, \"How you feeling?\" Limbaugh replied,\n\"I've never been happier,\" no doubt grateful every day that he never\nreceived the sort of \"justice\" that the Bush family is famous for\ndishing out to drug abusers, and that Limbaugh himself has supported\nin the past. Limbaugh also told Bush that people are \"praying\" for\nhim.\n\n\"That's the most important thing\npeople can do, is pray. And I appreciate that,\" Bush said.\n\n\"I can't speak for everybody,\"\nLimbaugh said in closing, \"but I can speak for quite a few. They love\nyou out there, Mr. President, and they only wish you the\nbest.\"\n\nGee, how come Matt Lauer didn't\nspeak to Bush that way?\n\nNo sooner had Bush gotten off the\nphone than Limbaugh got weird. \"I want to make a prediction. I hope\nI'm wrong, but I want to make a prediction,\" he said, noting that he\nexpected mainstream news organizations would cover the interview. \"I\nwouldn't be surprised - I would not be surprised if somewhere early\non in their stories ... don't be surprised if they find a way to work\nin the Abu Ghraib prison stuff.\"\n\nHuh? Well, there's no\narguing with Rush. After all, as he said of the mainstream media, \"I\nknow these people like every square inch of my glorious naked body.\"\nGot that?\n\nWONDERFUL OR MARVELOUS?\nMSNBC.com's \"Question of the Day\" is up on the home page right now.\nHave\na look. The question: \"Did\nRudy Giuliani's speech reassure you or move you to support the\nBush-Cheney ticket?\" The choices: \"Reassure\" and \"Move you to\nsupport.\" Really.\n\nI chose \"Reassure\" so that I could\nsee the results. It looks like I voted with the majority, 75 percent\nto 25 percent. Of course, we'll never know how \"Turn you off\" or\n\"Drive you to support the Kerry-Edwards ticket\" might have fared.\n(Thanks to John\nDoherty.) [Update: Well, that didn't take long. The question now reads \"Did Rudy Giuliani's speech move you to support the Bush-Cheney ticket?\" The new options are \"Yes\" and \"No.\"]\n\nMcCAIN THROWS BUSH A\nLIFE-PRESERVER. Rudy Giuliani spoke to the delegates. John McCain\nspoke to the country. That's why - despite the gushing you hear over\nGiuliani's funny, serious, nasty, and at times eloquent speech last\nnight - McCain actually did Bush more good, and got a leg up on his\nNew York rival in (God help us) the 2008 presidential\ncampaign.\n\nI can't find it online this\nmorning, but I'm pretty sure it was Fox News nitwit Morton Kondracke\nwho called McCain's speech \"self-serving\" in comparison to\nGiuliani's. What Kondracke liked about Rudy was the way he slashed at\nKerry. Later, Kondracke amended his remarks to allow that, well,\nMcCain did offer a rationale with the war in Iraq, and that\nwas useful to Bush.\n\nWell, duh. In fact, McCain - who'd\nwanted to go to war with Iraq for years - put forth a far more\neffective argument than George W. Bush has ever managed to muster. If\nBush can figure out a way to incorporate McCain's case into his own\nstump speech, he'll be a lot better off. McCain was wrong, but he was\nwrong in a way that was so much more palatable than Bush. Here's the\nheart of what\nMcCain said:\n\nThe years of keeping\nSaddam in a box were coming to a close. The international\nconsensus that he be kept isolated and unarmed had eroded to the\npoint that many critics of military action had decided the time\nhad come again to do business with Saddam, despite his near daily\nattacks on our pilots, and his refusal, until his last day in\npower, to allow the unrestricted inspection of his arsenal. Our\nchoice wasn't between a benign status quo and the bloodshed of\nwar.\n\nIt was between war and a graver\nthreat. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Not our critics\nabroad. Not our political opponents.\n\nHe followed that immediately with\nhis memorable attack on Michael Moore.\n\nNow, of course, there is much in\nMcCain's assessment with which to disagree. He failed to mention that\nMohamed ElBaradei, director-general of the International Atomic\nEnergy Agency, had already concluded that Saddam Hussein did not have\nnukes. McCain also left out the fact that UN weapons inspectors were\nswarming around Iraq, and that they actually had to leave so that\nBush could commence bombing. And, of course, there is the matter of\nBush's giving the finger to the world rather than building a genuine\ninternational coalition - a tragic mistake given the horrors that are\ntaking place in Iraq today.\n\nStill, McCain was right when he\nargued that sanctions had pretty much run their course, and that\nsomething had to be done. (After all, that's why John Kerry voted to\ngrant war-authorization powers to Bush.) It's just that the\n\"something\" Bush chose has turned out to be a widely predicted\ndisaster.\n\nAs for McCain's failure to rip into\nKerry, a failure that Kondracke found so distasteful - well, everyone\nwho follows politics knows that McCain likes and respects Kerry on a\npersonal level and detests Bush. (The depth of McCain's distaste for\nthe lying Swiftie ads is revealed in this\nR.W. Apple piece today.)\nWould anyone have found it even remotely credible if McCain had\nsuddenly gone after Kerry as a flip-flopping weasel?\n\nRather than coming off as a\nRepublican partisan, McCain projected an image as a truly independent\npolitician who's chosen a man he dislikes over one he likes strictly\nas a matter of principle. Just as Giuliani thanked God for Bush, Bush\nought to thank God for McCain. If McCain managed to help himself in\nthe process, well, what of it?\n\nTHE REST OF THE STORY. It's\nnot online, unfortunately, but there's a hilarious omission in\ntoday's Boston Globe. The \"Names\" column includes a photo of\nVanessa and Alexandra Kerry with this caption:\n\nPOP AND POLITICS - Vanessa\n(left) and Alexandra Kerry ask for quiet while urging the crowd to\nvote this fall at the MTV Video Music Awards Sunday in\nMiami.\n\nThe discerning will note that the\nreason they were asking quiet was that they were getting\nbooed\n(and cheered) by the\ncrowd.\n\nMonday, August 30, 2004\n\nThe medals and the\nCambodia charges are partisan hack stuff, cynically repeated in\nservice of the greater Republican good. What genuinely upsets\nconservatives - including conservative veterans - is something\ndifferent. First, conservatives think it's hypocritical for Kerry,\nwho denounced the war, to now take credit for having fought in it.\nAs The Wall Street Journal editorialized this week, Kerry\nhas \"managed the oxymoronic feat of celebrating both his own\nwar-fighting valor and his antiwar activities when he\nreturned home.\" But what's oxymoronic about that? What Kerry\n\"celebrates\" is that he volunteered for Vietnam - and served\nheroically - when elites (including Bill Clinton, Dan Quayle, and\nGeorge W. Bush) were finding ways not to go. That's noble, even if\nKerry thinks the war itself was not. And, if Kerry is a hypocrite\nfor having served in a war he opposed, what about Dick Cheney -\nwho avoided serving in a war he supported?\n\nJournalists, in short,\nbecame accomplices to fraud. And they should have known better. In\n2000, Bush and his right-wing allies learned that the way to win\npolitical arguments is to launch rhetorical attacks based only\nloosely - if at all - on the facts and then depend on reporters to\nspread them as credible perspectives on the truth. And, ever\nsince, this White House has conducted its business the very same\nway, shamelessly peddling lies about everything from budget\nprojections to weapons of mass destruction without the slightest\nfear of retribution.\n\nNever in a campaign has a\nmore disreputable group of people, whose accusations have been\nrepeatedly contradicted by official records and reliable\neyewitness accounts, had their claims taken so seriously.\n\nIs the New Republic\npartisan? Well, sure. It's nominally Democratic in a centrist,\nhawkish kind of way. But it also supported the war in Iraq, even\ngoing so far as to endorse Joe Lieberman in the Democratic primaries.\nIt also ran opposing views in favor of other Democrats - and couldn't\nfind a single person willing to write on Kerry's behalf.\n\nIn other words, TNR is far\nfrom being the house organ for the Kerry-Edwards campaign, and at one\ntime it was even sympathetic to Bush. [Update: I originally referred to the \"Bush-Edwards campaign.\" D'oh!] So its judgment on the Swifties\nbears paying attention to.\n\nMAYBE I SHOULDN'T HAVE STAYED\nHOME AFTER ALL.Editor & Publisher has some\neye-opening details on the luxuries\nawaiting reporters assigned to the Republican National Convention.\nHey - who's got time to do any real reporting when you're getting a\nfacial and sucking down a few bottles of complimentary\nbeer?\n\nPRAGUE SPRING? Earlier today I took part in a media conference call with some of the\nfounding members of Mainstream\n2004, a group of\nself-described moderate Republicans who are seething over the\nright-wing extremism that has come to dominate their party. The\norganization debuted with a splash today, taking out a full-page ad\nin the New York Times.\n\n\"We're seeing a Republican Party\nthat's being taken over by some pretty hardcore activists at the\ngrassroots level who are often way out of the mainstream of the\ncommunities they are from,\" said former Arizona attorney general\nGrant Woods. He went on to call the right-wingers folks who \"don't\nhave anything better to do\" than to engage in political activism,\nwhile the people who should be the heart and soul of the Republican\nParty are engaged in more-normal endeavors - like working.\n\nLike the others who spoke, Woods\nwas particularly exercised over the modern Republican Party's sorry\nrecord on the environment and on outreach to African-Americans and\nother minority communities.\n\nThe organization's agenda sounds\nlike that espoused by most Democrats: environmental protection;\nfiscal responsibility; ending barriers to stem-cell research;\nappointing \"mainstream federal judges\"; enhancing domestic security\nat chemical and nuclear plants and in shipping; and rebuilding\nalliances to \"restore America's standing in the world.\"\n\nYet these Republicans, at least as\na group, will not go so far as to renounce George W. Bush's\nre-election campaign. Woods allowed only that he's backing a\nhoped-for presidential run by his home-state senator John McCain in\n2008. Former Michigan governor William Milliken declined to say who\nhe plans to vote for, saying he has \"severe misgivings\" about Bush\nbut adding, \"I don't see in John Kerry at this stage the answer to\nall the problems that confront us inside the country and\ninternationally.\"\n\nThe exception was Rick Russman, a\nformer member of the New Hampshire Senate, who said he's decided to\nsupport Kerry if only \"because I think the party needs to lose a few\nelections\" to find its bearings again.\n\nIn some ways, the group - rounded\nout by former New Mexico governor David Cargo - sounded like New\nEngland Republicans. For some years now, the region's moderate\nRepublican senators have been a thorn in the side of the national\nRepublican Party, standing for an old-fashioned mix of fiscal\nconservatism and social liberalism. This movement is epitomized by\nMaine's two GOP senators, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as\nby Rhode Island's Lincoln Chafee. Vermont senator Jim Jeffords even\nwent so far to change his affiliation from Republican to independent\na few years ago to protest his party's march to the right.\n\nGiven that background, I asked\nRussman whether he thought the New England Republican Party had\nanything to teach the national party. \"I'd like to see some of our\nleaders, like these senators from Maine and others, take the lead in\nthat and try to take the party back to the mainstream,\" he responded.\n\"There's got to be a critical mass that says the pendulum's gone too\nfar. We're starting to lose a great number of people.\"\n\nThat's probably an exaggeration.\nBut there's no question that the hard-right extremists are\nout-of-touch with mainstream, independent voters, and Karl Rove knows\nit. That's why this week's speakers are heavy on moderates such as\nNew York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, former mayor Rudy Giuliani,\nand McCain. As Woods said, if party leaders wanted to show their true\nface, \"they should have Tom DeLay deliver the principal\nspeech.\"\n\nStill, though the Mainstream 2004\nfolks may be in touch with the electorate-at-large, there's not much\nevidence that they're in touch with modern Republicanism. Everyone\nwho spoke during the conference call today was a former\nofficeholder. Cargo shone the best possible light on that, saying,\n\"We can really tell it like it is.\" But their status only served to\nunderscore the sense that there is no place for them in today's\nGOP.\n\nMilliken praised thisNew York Times op-ed piece by former US senator Ed Brooke, a\nMassachusetts Republican, an African-American, and a liberal. Brooke\nwarned that the 2004 convention may be shaping up, in its\n\"extremism,\" like the one that nominated Barry Goldwater 40 years\nago. Yet what neither Milliken nor Brooke want to admit is that\ntoday's GOP - which is far to the right of what Goldwater could even\nhave imagined, or wanted - is thriving and winning\nelections.\n\nI was unable to get an immediate\nreaction from the Republican National Committee; if I receive one,\nI'll post it. What I was hearing from the dissident moderates,\nthough, sounded like the Republican version of 1968's Prague Spring.\nThe difference is that the Rove gang won't have to roll in the tanks\n- certainly not this year, and maybe not ever. Woods himself said\nthat the focus is on the long-term. Yet both major parties are\nbecoming more ideological, not less. It's hard to see how Mainstream\n2004 is going to change that.\n\nROMNEY BEHAVES HIMSELF. Give\nMitt Romney this much: at least you can take him out in public. Our\nsilky-smooth governor always says exactly what he wants to say, and\nno more. And he would never say anything that would call into\nquestion his nice-guy reputation. Of course, there are those of us\nwho happen to think that waging war on poor families and gay couples\nisn't something that a nice guy would do, but I'm talking about\nmanners here, not substance.\n\nAnyway, I was watching this\nmorning's Fox & Friends a little while ago - yes, I am\nspending a great deal of time with the Fox News Channel, for reasons\nthat will become evident later this week - when on came Romney for\nsome chit-chat. It wasn't long before E.D. Hill and boys were baiting\nRomney with their favorite subject: the phony Swifties, whose lies\nabout John Kerry's military service are being kept alive at this\npoint solely by right-wing talk radio, the Internet, and the Fox News\nChannel. (That is to say, by no one who has actually done any\nreporting on the matter.)\n\nRomney started off shakily, saying\nthat the whole thing was a \"mistake ... on both sides of the aisle,\"\nadding that Kerry \"really brought on a lot of this on himself\" by\nbasing so much of his campaign on his record as a Vietnam War\nveteran.\n\nReally, Governor? Has Kerry\nmade too much of his military service? Probably, at least so far as\nit has kept him from talking more specifically about what kind of a\npresident he would be. Does that mean it's his fault that he's\nbeen subjected to weeks of lies about the medals he won and\ncircumstances under which he won them? Er, isn't the answer to that\nobvious?\n\nBut then Romney settled down and\nsaid:\n\nBut fundamentally John\nKerry served his country with honor and pride. He's heroic for\nhaving fought there. Anybody who found themselves under enemy\nfire, in harm's way, is someone whom I respect. And I think the\npeople who are attacking him for his Vietnam service are making a\nmistake. I think it's wrong. I wish they wouldn't do so. I don't\nknow what it's going to do politically.\n\nNot bad - similar to the position\nthat George W. Bush has taken, only a bit more fleshed-out and\ncoherent.\n\nNaturally, Romney also attacked\nKerry for having \"not followed the example of Bob Dole\" in resigning\nfrom the Senate (Kerry instead appears to have followed the example\nof Bush, who did not resign as governor of Texas in 2000), and\nfor wanting to \"go back to the politics of weakness and uncertainty\nand vacillation.\" But obviously that's well within the bounds of\nproper political discourse.\n\nWhat's interesting about this - and\nmy apologies for taking so long to get to the point - is how the\nRepublicans are reaping the benefit of having it both ways with\nregard to the lying Swifties. Their vicious accusations - which have\nbeen almost entirely discredited - have presumably had a lot to do\nwith Kerry's recent drop in the polls. Meanwhile, Republicans such as\nBush and Romney take the high road.\n\nYou could give credit to Romney for\ngood manners. In fact, though, whether he knows it or not, he's\nplaying a role that only helps to further the Swifties' ongoing\nassault on Kerry. After all, sliming is a lot less effective if it\nends up hitting the intended beneficiaries in the face. By denouncing that which is helping them, Bush and Romney are playing a very old game.\n\nHASTERT SLANDERS SOROS. WILL\nANYONE NOTICE? Welcome to the official kickoff of Media Log's\ncoverage of the Republican National Convention. I'm taking a\nradically different approach from the way I covered the Democrats -\nrather than traveling to New York, I'm embedded at Media Log Central,\nwhere I have non-stop access to cable TV, radio, and the Internet.\nModern political conventions are TV shows, so why not cover them that\nway?\n\nI posted some pre-convention items\non Saturday and Sunday, so by all means scroll down and have a look.\nMeanwhile, I want to call your attention to House Speaker Dennis\nHastert's astonishing remarks on Fox News Sunday yesterday, in\nwhich he said he doesn't know whether billionaire financier\nGeorge Soros gets any of his money from the international drug\ncartels.\n\nThink I'm kidding? Well, the\ntranscript\nis available. The occasion was a joint appearance by Hastert and\nSenate majority leader Bill Frist - their \"first joint TV interview\never,\" said host Chris Wallace, who unctuously added, \"So thank you\nfor honoring us with that.\"\n\nWithin a few minutes, Hastert was\nhonoring Wallace and his viewers with slander against Soros so mind-boggling that Wallace appeared stricken. Let's roll the\ntape:\n\nWALLACE:\nLet me switch subjects. You both had very deep reservations about\nMcCain-Feingold campaign-finance reform before it was passed. In\nfact, I think you say in your book, Mr. Speaker, that you thought\nit was the worst piece of legislation that had been passed by a\nRepublican Congress since you've come to Washington.\n\nNow that\neveryone seems upset with these so-called independent 527 groups,\nwhether it's MoveOn.org on the liberal side of the spectrum or\nSwift Boat Veterans for Truth on the conservative side, do you\nfeel like saying, \"I told you so\"?\n\nHASTERT: Well,\nyou know, that doesn't do any good. You know, but look behind us\nat this convention. I remember when I was a kid watching my first\nconvention in 1992, when both the Democratic Party and the\nRepublican Party laid out their platform, laid out their\nphilosophy, and that's what they followed.\n\nHere in this\ncampaign, quote, unquote, \"reform,\" you take party power away from\nthe party, you take the philosophical ideas away from the party,\nand give them to these independent groups.\n\nYou know, I\ndon't know where George Soros gets his money. I don't know where -\nif it comes overseas or from drug groups or where it comes\nfrom. And I ...\n\nWALLACE: Excuse\nme?\n\nHASTERT: Well,\nthat's what he's been for a number years - George Soros has been\nfor legalizing drugs in this country. So, I mean, he's got a lot\nof ancillary interests out there.\n\nWALLACE: You\nthink he may be getting money from the drug cartel?\n\nHASTERT: I'm\nsaying I don't know where groups - could be people who support\nthis type of thing. I'm saying we don't know. The fact is we don't\nknow where this money comes from.\n\nOf course, it's\ntrue that \"we don't know\" whether George Soros gets his money from\ninternational narco-terrorists. It's also true that we don't know whether\nDennis Hastert supports a constitutional amendment banning same-sex\nmarriage in order to conceal his own longtime relationship with a man\nback in his district. I mean, Hastert is probably straight,\nand his marriage probably isn't just an elaborate ruse. But\nhey ... we just don't know, do we?\n\nAnd by the way,\nmega-kudos to Wallace. If he hadn't pressed Hastert on whether he\nmight be referring to \"the drug cartel,\" Hastert could have claimed\nlater that he meant the Drug\nPolicy Alliance, an\nanti-prohibition group that Soros supports. Not that that would have\nmade any sense - after all, Hastert was clearly talking about groups\nthat give to Soros, not get money from him. But Wallace forced\nHastert to make his ugly insinuation explicit.\n\nSo are the\nmainstream media going to take note of Hastert's slanderous aside? Or\nwill it be allowed simply to fade to nothingness? [Update: The New York Daily News nails Hastert here.]\n\nGUERRIERO'S\nMOMENT. This could be a big week for Patrick Guerriero, the\nformer Melrose mayor who's now executive director of the Log Cabin\nRepublicans. The Bush-Cheney campaign is trying mightily to toe the\nline between hard-right anti-gay politics and happy-face\nimage-making. Guerriero is making it clear that no compromise is\npossible: if you embrace hate politics, you're a hater,\nperiod.\n\nThe Globe's\nYvonne Abraham profiles\nGuerriero today, and he has an op-ed\npiece in the paper as\nwell.\n\nSEEING RED,\nSPENDING GREEN. If nothing else, the Republican convention is an\nopportunity for the New York Times to rake in big bucks from\nanti-Bush organizations.\n\nSunday, August 29, 2004\n\n\"I'm constantly in touch\nwith Karl, Karen, Dan Bartlett, people who are involved with the\ncampaign,\" Mr. Bush said in the interview last week. \"I don't\nlimit my conversation to a particular time of the day.'' But, he\nadded, \"if the question is, 'Is it different running this time\nnow that you're the president?' the answer is yes. I've got a job\nto do.\"\n\nIn 2000, you may recall, Bush was\ngovernor of Texas. I guess that doesn't count. But of course, it's\nvery, very bad that Kerry's missed\na lot of votes. Just one\nmore example of how your intelligence is being insulted every\nday.\n\nBLOGGER STRIKES BACK. For\nthose of you who receive Media Log by e-mail, mucho apologies for the\nmultiple copies of the David Brooks item. It was caused by a\nmomentary problem with Blogger.com, the software that I use to\npublish Media Log, combined with my own lack of patience.\n\nBROOKS'S FAVORITE\nREPUBLICANS. They're all dead! For just one day, at least, David\nBrooks the newly minted, hardcore conservative pundit has gone back\nto being David Brooks the thoughtful, slightly right-of-center\nmoderate. In a long piece for today's New York Times Magazine,\n\"How\nto Reinvent the G.O.P.,\"\nBrooks lays out the specifics of an overarching Brooksian political\nphilosophy. It is a fine essay, yet it is also unintentionally\nhilarious.\n\nBrooks harks\nback to 2000, when he and William Kristol made the case in the\nWeekly Standard for what they called \"national-greatness\nconservatism\" and hitched their wagon to the presidential campaign of\nJohn McCain. It was a courageous move, given the long odds facing\nMcCain. The Standard, founded by Rupert Murdoch as a\nhouse organ for the newly ascendant Republican Party of the Gingrich\nera, found itself frozen out, at least until after the terrorist\nattacks of 9/11, when the GOP's interventionist McCain wing and the\nisolationist Bush wing came together.\n(There's a decent explanation of national-greatness conservatism -\nand of the roles played by Brooks, Kristol, and McCain - in\nthis\n2002 American Prospect article by Richard Just.)\n\nWhat cracks me up about\nBrooks's piece are two things: the only Republicans and\nproto-Republicans he can find to say much nice about are Alexander\nHamilton, Abraham Lincoln, and Theodore Roosevelt; and the program\nBrooks lays out sounds a whole lot more New Democrat than Bush\nRepublican: entitlement reform, social mobility, an end to corporate\nwelfare, energy independence, and mandatory national\nservice.\n\nThe most important Brooksian\npriority - what he calls \"the war on Islamic extremism\" - is, of\ncourse, something that George W. Bush has attempted to transform into\na trademarked slogan of the Republican Party. But I've seen no\nevidence that real-world Democrats (that is, John Kerry, not Howard\nDean) aren't just as committed to combating Islamist terrorists as\nBush is. Perhaps rather more so, since Kerry presumably wouldn't have\nmore than 100,000 troops tied up in Iraq while Osama bin Laden and\ncompany run free on the border between Afghanistan and\nPakistan.\n\nBrooks isn't calling his philosophy\nnational-greatness conservatism anymore, and his attempts to come up\nwith a new name are painful. He tries out \"strong-government\nprogressive conservatism,\" but though it does have the merit of\nactually describing his ideas to some extent, it doesn't exactly roll\ntrippingly off the tongue.\n\nBrooks's\npolitics come across as a meld of the best of Bill Clinton and John\nMcCain - a slightly more conservative version of the New Democrat\nagenda, which itself was quite a bit more conservative than the\nDemocratic Party of George McGovern and Walter Mondale. Kerry ought\nto take a good, hard look at some of the ideas that Brooks is\nproposing. Why not? It's pretty clear that Bush won't.\n\nSaturday, August 28, 2004\n\nI assume Vonnegut is\nreferring to claims that under the Patriot Act, John Ashcroft's\ngoons have been terrorizing libraries and monitoring Americans'\nreading habits. In fact, law enforcement agencies have always had\nthe power to request library records as part of a criminal\ninvestigation; a provision of the Patriot Act gave them the power\nto do so in counterterrorism investigations without notifying the\nsuspect. (Remember, we're talking about materials related to\nterrorist acts and not, say, the wit and wisdom of Michael Moore.)\nWhether or not such powers are appropriate, in the two years\nafter the passage of the Patriot Act this provision was used\nexactly ... zero times. [Young's ellipses.]\n\nNo doubt Young was relying on\nstories like this.\nBut here's an excerpt from the results of a study\nconducted by the University of Illinois at\nUrbana-Champaign:\n\nIn the year after the\nWorld Trade Center and Pentagon attacks, Federal and local law\nenforcement officials visited at least 545 (10.7%) libraries to\nask for these records. Of these, 178 libraries (3.5%) received\nvisits from the FBI. The number of libraries queried fell\nsignificantly below the 703 libraries reporting such requests the\nyear before the terrorist events. The actual number questioned\nin the past year may, however, be larger, because the USA Patriot\nAct makes it illegal for persons or institutions to disclose that\na search warrant has been served. A warning about these\nsecrecy provisions on the LRC questionnaire may have served, in\nsome cases, as a deterrent to candid answers. Fifteen libraries\nacknowledged there were questions they did not answer because they\nwere legally prohibited from doing so.\n\nIn other words, the answer to the\nquestion of whether and how the Patriot Act is being used to snoop on\nlibrary patrons is inherently unknowable, since the act also makes it\na crime for librarians to disclose whether they've been visited or\nnot. The very fact that the number of reported library visits\nby law-enforcement officials fell in the year after 9/11 is\ntelling, wouldn't you say?\n\nPLYING THE MEDIA WITH LIES.\nMedia Log is still technically on vacation. But I've been catching up\non the news following a three-day backpacking trip last week, and I\ncontinue to be astounded at what's happening to John Kerry's\npresidential campaign.\n\nThe media have not necessarily done\na horrible job of covering the claims of Swift\nBoat Veterans for Truth.\nIndeed, if it weren't for news orgs such as the New York Times\nand the Washington Post, it might not be as clear as it\nalready is that the vets' claims consist of nothing but ugly\nlies.\n\nStill, editors and news directors\nshould consider that the way they practice journalism allowed the\nlies to circulate and propagate, putting John Kerry's presidential\ncampaign on the defensive and costing him a few points in the polls\nheading into the Republican National Convention.\n\nThe outrageous claims of the\nSwiftvets - that one of Kerry's Purple Heart wounds was\nself-inflicted, that he and his crew weren't really under fire when\nhe rescued James Rassmann and won the Bronze Star, that he executed a Vietnamese\nkid in a loincloth in winning the Silver Star (it was actually a Viet Cong soldier with a grenade-launcher) - should have been\ntreated as presumptively untrue from Day One.\n\nYou didn't have to do any\ninvestigative reporting to know that the official military records\nbacked up Kerry's version of events (no, military records aren't\nperfect, but they're not meaningless, either), and that Kerry's\nhometown newspaper, the Boston Globe, had investigated his\nmilitary record extensively on at least two separate occasions, in\n1996 and again in 2003. Right-wing conspiracy theories aside, there\nis zero evidence that the Globe has ever tried to cut\nKerry any slack. Plus there is the fact that all but one of the men\nwith whom Kerry actually served support Kerry's version of events.\n(How deep is the lying? The very fact that the Swiftvets say they\n\"served with Kerry\" is itself a lie.)\n\nThe invaluable contribution that\nthe Times and the Post made was to show that in many\ncases the Swiftvets had changed their stories over the years from\npro-Kerry to anti-Kerry, and that some of them claimed to have\nwitnessed events that they could not have.\n\nBut the Swiftvets and their shadowy\nbackers understood something about the media: if you make an\naccusation, news orgs will cover it, get a response from the person\nor persons being accused, and run with it. Truth isn't the issue, at\nleast not in day-to-day campaign coverage. Getting both sides is the\nname of the game, even if there isn't a single reason to believe one\nside and every reason to believe the other.\n\nThe only charge raised against\nKerry that seems to be sticking at all is that he falsely claimed to\nhave been in Cambodia on Christmas Eve 1968 - a charge that has\ngained resonance because Kerry once mistakenly stated that Richard\nNixon was president at that time. But as the historian\nDouglas\nBrinkley has said, Kerry\nwas involved in extremely dangerous missions in and around the\nCambodian border during that time period. It is curious, to say the\nleast, that Kerry-haters are willing to overlook blatant lies by the\nSwiftvets about where they were and what they saw while pillorying\nKerry for misremembering the timing of events that actually\noccurred.\n\nYesterday brought a brief flurry of\nnew excitement in the form of a Robert\nNovak column reporting that\nretired rear admiral William Schachte - who's not a member of\nthe Swiftvets group - was continuing to claim that he was present\nwhen Kerry \"nicked\" himself and therefore unjustly won his first\nPurple Heart. Yet we already have the testimony of others who were\nthere that Schachte was not. As the Times recently\nreported,\nPatrick Runyon and Bill Zaladonis insist they were the only crew\nmembers with Kerry when the incident occurred. \"Me and Bill aren't\nthe smartest, but we can count to three,\" Runyon was quoted as\nsaying. But you know the game: Novak reports, you decide, even if you\ndon't have the background to make an informed analysis as to who's\ntelling the truth.\n\nAs always, Bob\nSomerby has been invaluable\nin dissecting the lies of the Swiftvets, and of the pathetically poor\npreparation that cable-news hosts have brought to the table when they\nhave interviewed them - even those who suspect that the vets are lying, like MSNBC's Chris Matthews. (If he'd do his homework, he'd know they're lying.)\n\nKerry, I think, is making one\nserious mistake. He has denounced the lies of the Swiftvets, as he\nshould. But by going after the ties between the Swiftvets and the\nBush-Cheney campaign - ties that became all too apparent with the\nresignation\nof Bush water-carrier Benjamin Ginsberg - Kerry is playing George W.\nBush's game.\n\nRather than denounce his\nsupporters' lies, Bush has attempted to turn the entire issue into\none of the 527s, the independent political organizations running\nnegative ads on both sides. Kerry won a victory with Ginsberg's\nself-immolation. But if it turns out that there are similar ties\nbetween the Kerry-Edwards campaign and some of the liberal 527s (a\ndevelopment that would hardly be a surprise), then the media will be\nable to pronounce this an \"everyone does it\" story and transform the\nentire Swiftvets campaign into a matter of moral equivalence with the\nanti-Bush ads being run by MoveOn.org\nand others.\n\nIt's not. What the Swiftvets are\ndoing is as dirty and shocking and disgraceful as anything done in\nmodern political history - far worse than the infamous Willie Horton\nad that George H.W. Bush's supporters ran in going after Michael Dukakis. Kerry\ncannot let the lies of the Swiftvets be held up as somehow the same\nas entirely truthful ads questioning Bush's missing months in the\nTexas Air National Guard.\n\nSaturday, August 21, 2004\n\nTHE REST OF THE STORY. Media\nLog is on vacation, and will not officially be back until August 30\n... maybe a little earlier, depending on what I want to say about the\nRepublican National Convention.\n\nBut I can't resist asking why the\nGlobe couldn't manage to report that state rep Paul Kujawski\nhas been accused of staggering out of his car and taking a leak in\nfront of state troopers after he was pulled over on the Mass Pike on\nsuspicion of drunk driving.\n\nFor crying out loud, I heard this\nparticular detail yesterday afternoon. (And no, I didn't get it from listening to Howie Carr.) The Herald's Ann Donlan\nhas\nit today, writing that\nKujawski \"got even deeper in trouble after urinating in front of the\ntroopers who stopped him.\" But the Globe's Elise Castelli,\nafter reporting\nthat Kujawski had been charged with drunk driving, disorderly\nconduct, and \"open and gross lewdness,\" goes on to write: \"The police\ndeclined to comment on what transpired after Kujawski's car was\npulled over.\"\n\nFar from doing Kujawski any favors,\nthe Globe makes it sound like he exposed himself to a busload\nof kindergarten students or something.\n\n\"I'm thrilled with this\nopportunity. It's going to be a lot of fun, a lot of work. We are\nreally going to pour high octane in the engine of this department,\nand just tear ass after all the exciting business news in Boston,\"\nMacero told me.\n\nAs for specifics, Macero was less\nclear, except that he obviously wants to find a way to appeal to\nyounger readers. \"It's time to move past some of the dinosaurs in\nthis city and look at the next generation of business leaders,\" he\nsaid. \"We want to focus on who is behind some of our most noteworthy\ncompanies as well as some of our most up-and-coming companies and the\nindustries that make this city tick.\" He also talked about his desire\nto \"have a little fun in doing it\" and bring \"a little more pizzazz\nand splash into our business coverage.\"\n\nMacero plans to keep writing his\ncolumn as well, although he said it might appear only once or twice a\nweek instead of the current four.\n\nMacero's rise is likely to be\npopular inside the newsroom. Says one staff member who asked not to\nbe identified: \"The amount of energy he brings to the room is\nextraordinary. I think he wants us really out there in the community\na lot more than we really have been.\"\n\nAdds managing editor Kevin Convey\n(who's not related to Eric Convey): \"The idea was that we felt that\nthe section needed new leadership and that it needs to go in a\ndifferent direction.\" He says, \"I think the section needs to be made\nmore relevant to the business of business in Boston,\" and that it\nneeds \"a more lively presentation than had been the practice in the\npast,\" and to \"select a few major industries and own\nthem.\"\n\nBoth Convey and Macero said the\nright things about Bunker and Schubarth, with Convey saying they put\nout \"a solid section\" and Macero adding that they \"set a really high\nstandard.\" Sources also say that Schubarth was well-liked among the\nstaff. But Macero is almost certain to prove more popular with the\ntroops than Bunker, who'd been the Herald's business editor\nsince 1997, and whose management style had long been the source of\ninternal grumbling.\n\nMacero may also help re-spark the\npaper's rivalry with the dominant Boston Globe for local\nbusiness news. \"We have a lot of respect for Cosmo,\" says the\nGlobe's deputy business editor, Bennie DiNardo. \"He's a very\naggressive columnist, and we look forward to competing with him every\nday. If he's anything as an editor like he is as a columnist, it\nshould be fun.\"\n\nThough neither Macero nor Kevin\nConvey made the analogy, the formula that may be at work here is that\nof the New York Post. The Post's formula - outrageous\nsensationalism in its news coverage, a good sports section, and\nsurprisingly smart business coverage - has made it a player in New\nYork, even if it remains a chronic money-loser.\n\nIn recent months, the Herald\nhas certainly embraced the outrageous aspects of the Post. In\nnaming Macero to the top business job, the paper may be seeking to\nemulate some of the Post's better qualities as\nwell.\n\nTHE END OF A SMEAR. The talk\nof the political world today is the New York Times'\nevisceration\nof Swift Boat Veterans for Truth. Clocking in at nearly 3500 words,\nthe piece - by Kate Zernike and Jim Rutenberg - demonstrates\ndefinitively that these anti-John Kerry veterans are not only\ncontradicting what they've said about Kerry in the past, but also\nwhat's in the official record.\n\nFor good measure, the Times\nalso shows how the group and its financing grew out of the\nBush-family/Karl Rove political machine in Texas, some of which had\npreviously been reported by Salon\nand other outlets. But that wouldn't be especially important if there\nwere anything to the vets' claims. There isn't, nor was there ever\nany reason to suppose there was. These are not the men who served\ndirectly with Kerry. The only reason they were ever taken seriously\nby anyone is that their tale fits into right-wing attempts to smear\nKerry for his role as a leading anti-war activist.\n\nIt turns out that yesterday's\nWashington Postexpos\u00e9\nof Larry Thurlow was just an appetizer. As \"The\nNote\" asks today, \"Does the\nstory peter out on its own over the weekend, or does the now\nopened-can of worms continue to bear ? well, worms?\"\n\nIn the Globe, Patrick Healy\nand Michael Kranish have an account\nof Kerry's decision finally to take on George W. Bush directly over\nthe vets' sleazy ads. Media Log wonders: did Kerry speak\nout yesterday knowing that,\nthe next morning, the Times would destroy what little was left\nof his critics' credibility?\n\nMeanwhile, Drudge - who has still\nnot withdrawn his sliming\nof Kranish - is very\nexcited about reports that\nthe Kerry campaign has asked bookstores to consider withdrawing the\nvets' book, Unfit for Command. Well, what's wrong with that?\nAs Eric Boehlert notes,\nit's hardly unusual for booksellers to disavow books that turn out to\nbe a hoax. Which is precisely what this is.\n\nNARRATIVE TRIUMPH. Like you,\nI scanned the Globe's four-part series \"Best\nMen\" earlier this week and\ntold myself: Sorry, I don't have the time. Unlike you, I went\nback and read the entire series on the Web after the last installment\nhad been published. I'm glad I did.\n\nWritten and reported by Thomas\nFarragher and Patricia Wen, and photographed by Michele McDonald,\n\"Best Men\" is well worth it. It tells the story of two brothers, one\ngay, one straight, and of their marriages - one of which, needless to\nsay, would not have been possible until this past spring.\n\nIt is a first-rate example of\nnarrative journalism, wonderfully written and photographed. Best of\nall, the subjects themselves are worthy of the thousands of words\nthat have been lavished on them - not always the case when a\nnewspaper trains its eye on ordinary people.\n\nThe Web version has more photos\nthan were published in the print edition, as well as audio clips.\n\nThursday, August 19, 2004\n\nKERRY UPDATE. Two good\npieces of news today for John Kerry:\n\n1. One of his leading tormenters on\nthe swift-boat matter turns out to have been telling a tale that's\ncompletely contradicted by his own Bronze Star citation. The\nWashington Post FOIA'd the military records of Larry Thurlow\nand discovered,\nlo and behold, that the documents say his and Kerry's boats really\nwere under fire on the day that they both won Bronze Stars. Thurlow\nhas loudly claimed that Kerry made that up.\n\nThurlow splutters to the\nPost's Michael Dobbs: \"It's like a Hollywood presentation\nhere, which wasn't the case. My personal feeling was always that I\ngot the award for coming to the rescue of the boat that was mined.\nThis casts doubt on anybody's awards. It is sickening and\ndisgusting.\" Thurlow even goes so far as to speculate that he\nreceived what he calls a \"fraudulent\" Bronze Star on the basis of\nKerry's so-called lies.\n\nSorry, Mr. Thurlow. I'd say that\nSwift Boat Veterans for Truth's 15 minutes is just about at the 14:55\nmark right now.\n\n2. The Boston Herald's\n\"Inside Track\" reveals\na \"steamy secret 20-month fling\" that Kerry had that left his former\nparamour \"heartbroken\" - but she says she's going to vote for him,\nand she calls Teresa Heinz Kerry \"awesome.\" She's even decided to\nhold off on publishing a roman \u00e0 clef about their romance\nuntil after the election.\n\nIt really doesn't get much better\nthan that, does it? The Kerry campaign ought to send out copies of\nthe \"Track\" to every undecided voter in the country.\n\nWednesday, August 18, 2004\n\nMORE ON THE FBI'S INTIMIDATION\nTACTICS. The New York Times is getting a lot of bounce for\nits front-page story Monday on the FBI's attempts to intimidate\npolitical activists into not traveling to New York for the Republican\nNational Convention. According to the Times, the bureau\nearlier engaged in similar tactics to keep protesters away from the\nDemocratic convention in Boston.\n\nWell, here's a story that should\nhave gotten more attention at the time: a report\nby Jules Crittenden of the Boston Herald that was published on\nJuly 28. Crittenden's lead:\n\nPeace activists say the\nFBI has been harassing and intimidating them with visits across\nthe country, including an incident in Boston Saturday where\nfederal agents, police and firefighters searched a \"mobile\nkitchen\" and seized five propane tanks.\n\nDICK CHENEY, \"SENSITIVE\"\nWARRIOR. You should read Bob Somerby every\nday. But you absolutely\nmust read this.\nUnless you don't want further evidence of what a pathetic, lying,\nmiserable vice-president we have. And Somerby's right about another\nthing: why isn't this the lead political story for every news org in\nthe country?\n\nEARLY TO VOTE. In the swing\nstates of Iowa and Arizona, voters will be able to cast their ballots\nin the presidential campaign before George W. Bush and John Kerry\nhave held their first debate.\n\nIn Wisconsin, Washington, New\nMexico, and West Virginia they'll be able to vote before the third\nand possibly decisive debate.\n\nPeople in five other swing states -\nNorth Carolina, Nevada, Arkansas, Colorado, and Florida - can vote as early as mid-October, with, of course, no possibility of changing their\nminds depending on what happens in the final two weeks of the\ncampaign.\n\nIs this good for democracy? I don't\nthink so. Yet it's a central reality of the 2004 campaign, as John\nHarwood reports\n(sub. req.) in today's Wall Street Journal. Harwood writes\nthat, according to some estimates, as many as one-third of voters\nwill cast their ballots before the November 2 election. He\nadds:\n\nThe potential implications\nof such growth in early ballots are enormous, if unpredictable. In\nIowa, for instance, voting kicks off a week before the first of\nthree scheduled Bush-Kerry debates. Pre-debate voting could lift\nthe incumbent in a contest that Democratic strategists like to\ncompare with the 1980 contest between President Jimmy Carter and\nRonald Reagan, which broke sharply toward Mr. Reagan after a\ndebate assured wavering voters of his competence.\n\nAt the same time, early votes\nmight precede the sort of late-breaking events that many Democrats\nbelieve could help Mr. Bush - such as the capture of Osama bin\nLaden, or a terror strike on U.S. soil.\n\nThe change has come about,\naccording to Harwood, because it appeals to \"time-pressed voters.\"\nBut those same voters could be accommodated just as well through a\nlong-overdue reform: holding elections for two or three days over a\nweekend. That would make voting much easier than it is now, while at\nthe same time keeping the idea of the election as a singular event\nrather than something that is dragged out over several\nmonths.\n\nIn a recent interview, Joe Lenski,\nexecutive vice-president of Edison Media Research, told me that as\nmany as 20 million people - 20 percent of the total - could vote by\nabsentee ballot this year. He cited a reason that Harwood doesn't\nmention: fears raised by 2000's Florida fiasco that your vote may not\ncount. Mailing in a paper ballot is just more reassuring than\ntouching a screen on a voting machine, Lenski explained. (Edison has\ndone exit\npolling for the television\nnetworks and the Associated Press. Its market-research clients\ninclude the Phoenix Media/Communications Group.)\n\nSadly, that's a different issue not\nsolved by weekend voting. The breakdown of trust - documented just\nthis week alone by New York Times columnists Paul\nKrugman and\nBob\nHerbert - is real and\nongoing. In that sense, the rise of the absentee ballot is not a sign\nof disengagement, but rather of a burning desire to stay engaged even\nin the face of real doubts.\n\nTuesday, August 17, 2004\n\nPREPAREDNESS FOR WHAT? What\nbetter time to educate the country about terrorist threats than\nSeptember, right after the kids go back to school? After all, if you\ncan get people thinking about gas masks or how fast they can drive\nout of the city if a dirty bomb goes off, they might have less time\nto contemplate other matters ... like, I don't know, the presidential\nelection or something.\n\nSo you've got to wonder - or maybe\nnot - about the Department of Homeland Security's plans to kick off\nNational\nPreparedness Month on\nSeptember 9. The timing alone sets off WMD sirens: the Republican\nNational Convention will have just concluded, and the third\nanniversary of the terrorist attacks will follow two days\nlater.\n\nNot that any of this could possibly\nhave anything to do with politics. After all, as Homeland Security\nsecretary Tom Ridge recently explained,\n\"We don't do politics.\" Never mind that his earlier terror warning,\nright after the Democratic National Convention, amounted to little\nmore than a free ad for Bush-Cheney 2004, with Ridge hailing\n\"the president's leadership in the war against terror.\"\n\nNPR's On the Media has a\nsplendid segment on this fiasco, which you can listen to in RealAudio\nhere.\nBrooke Gladstone interviews Bob Harris, the author of\na\nwithering post at This\nModern World.\n\nI do not necessarily subscribe to\nthe theory that Dick Cheney's got Osama bin Laden's head in a freezer\nsomewhere, ready for George W. Bush to pull out from beneath the\npodium about midway through the third debate. But there's no question\nthat these people are willing to go a long way to keep\npower.\n\nLook at the terrorist arrest sprung\njust before John Kerry's acceptance speech, a matter\nthat the New Republic has reported on in great\ndetail.\n\nHere's a thought for National\nPreparedness Month: what are your family's plans for dealing\nwith dubious political propaganda in the weeks leading up to the\npresidential election?\n\nMonday, August 16, 2004\n\nJUST BECAUSE YOU'RE PARANOID\nDOESN'T MEAN THEY'RE NOT OUT TO GET YOU. A truly chilling\nstory\non the front of today's New York Times. Eric Lichtblau reports\nthat the FBI has been visiting dissidents across the country - and in\nsome cases even issuing subpoenas - in an attempt to stop illegal\nactivity before it starts at the Republican National\nConvention.\n\nAnd that's the best\ninterpretation of it. The tactics really seem aimed at scaring\nwould-be protesters into staying away from New York.\n\nIn an internal complaint,\nan F.B.I. employee charged that the bulletins improperly blurred\nthe line between lawfully protected speech and illegal activity.\nBut the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, in a\nfive-page internal analysis obtained by The New York Times,\ndisagreed.\n\nThe office, which also made\nheadlines in June in an opinion - since disavowed - that\nauthorized the use of torture against terrorism suspects in\nsome circumstances, said any First Amendment impact posed by the\nF.B.I.'s monitoring of the political protests was negligible and\nconstitutional.\n\nBy the way, here\nis the \"Denver antiwar group\" that Lichtblau refers to near the top\nof his article - the American Friends Service Committee. According to\nthe Times, 21-year-old intern Sarah Bardwell was visited by\nsix agents. John Ashcroft knows that you just can't be too\ncareful with those Quakers.\n\nBUSH, SLIDING. Josh Marshall\nnotes\nthat Washington Post columnist David Broder, the ultimate\nestablishmentarian, has embraced\nthe slowly emerging consensus that George W. Bush is heading toward a\ndecisive loss this November.\n\nBut Yale economist Ray C. Fair - a\nJohn Kerry supporter - tells\nthe New York Times Magazine that his econometric model shows\nBush coasting with nearly 58 percent of the vote.\n\nMedia Log's prediction: the event\nor events that will determine the outcome have yet to\noccur.\n\nAbout Media Log Archives\n\nThe Boston Phoenix's Media Log was launched in 2002 by the paper's then-media columnist, Dan Kennedy, who continued it until he left the paper in 2005. The Phoenix's current media columnist, Adam Reilly, is now the author of Media Log, which has since been renamed Don't Quote Me. Kennedy, an assistant professor of journalism at Northeastern University, blogs at Media Nation."
