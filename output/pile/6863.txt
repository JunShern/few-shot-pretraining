    "text": "Among the four women flanking Donald Trump at his Facebook-Lived news conference before the second presidential debate, Paula Jones stood out.\n\nThe women had been assembled by Trump to counter criticism following the leak of a 2005 video in which the GOP candidate bragged about using his star power to sexually assault women. And so he turned to Juanita Broaddrick, Kathleen Willey, Kathleen Shelton, and Jones, who all shared a mutual opposition to the Clintons\u2014three, including Jones, had accused Bill Clinton of sexual assault or harassment in the past. The fourth, Kathleen Shelton, was raped when she was 12 years old. Hillary Clinton was her accused rapist\u2019s defense lawyer.\n\nWhen a reporter asked Trump whether he\u2019d actually groped women as he claimed in the leaked Access Hollywood video, Jones\u2014a plucky 49-year old Arkansan wearing head-to-toe Victoria\u2019s Secret loungewear and a bedazzled hat\u2014snapped back in her trademarked drawl, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go ask Bill Clinton that? Why don\u2019t you ask Hillary as well?\u201d\n\nTwo days before, Jones had railed against Trump having to apologize for his boorish comments, in effect saying, \u201cWhere is my apology?\u201d\n\nTrump supporters praised Jones\u2019s moxie online as reporters whipped up \u201cWho is Paula Jones?\u201d explainers for millennials, and far-right media outlets clamored for interviews.\n\nJones\u2019s dive back into the national spotlight via Trump\u2019s campaign feels at once an unexpected and somehow wholly appropriate end to an election that\u2019s laid bare the political truth that truly nothing matters. Trump, who once publicly ridiculed Jones as \u201ca loser\u201d for claiming Bill Clinton had sexually harassed her, was parading her onstage to distract voters from his own growing list sexual-assault accusations. Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton\u2014who as first lady dismissed Jones as a pawn of her husband\u2019s political enemies and called her accusations fiction\u2014quietly changed the language in her sexual-assault platform, erasing the notion that professed victims should \u201cbe believed.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the conservatives who, back in the \u201990s, peddled in faux outrage to manipulate and profit from Jones and her claims\u2014then deserted her when she no longer advanced their political agenda\u2014are the same ones who are compromising their professed Christian values in order to embrace their undeniably vulgar, possibly criminal, Republican nominee. What\u2019s most surprising, is that 16 years after acknowledging she\u2019d been used by the far-right movement in a crusade to take down the Clintons, Jones is enthusiastically taking her place back on their team.\n\nPaula Jones\u2019s story was, and is, catnip for conservatives: She has consistently claimed that in 1991, when she was a 24-year-old state employee making $6.35 an hour, Bill Clinton, then Arkansas\u2019s governor, made several unwanted sexual advances and exposed himself to her in a Little Rock hotel room. When Jones expressed shock and disgust, she says Clinton stopped, and told her, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t want to make you do anything you don\u2019t want to do.\u201d After the alleged encounter, Jones claimed she was threatened, intimidated, and reassigned\u2014all, she claimed, as retribution for refusing Clinton.\n\nThe sexual-harassment lawsuit her allegations spawned dragged on five long years\u2014thanks to a group of anti-Clinton conservatives who saw Jones as a means to take down the president\u2014and ended with Clinton handing over an $850,000 out-of-court settlement but never an apology or acknowledgment of any wrongdoing. The president also survived the impeachment fight her case triggered. Clinton has steadfastly denied Jones\u2019s allegations and maintained he doesn\u2019t remember meeting her.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad it\u2019s over with, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Jones told Joe Conason in a 2000 Penthouse interview\u2014the third, and only voluntary time, Jones appeared in the magazine. \u201cAnd I wish it could have been over with a lot sooner. I\u2019m not looking for fame or fortune or anything like that.\u201d\n\nJones had reason to be relieved; the \u201990s had been hell.\n\nShe had taken a beating from the Clinton camp and the national media, been ostracized or ignored by feminist groups, and used then discarded many times over\u2014by the press and pornographers, as well as politically or financially motivated conservative groups that feigned to help her, while working against her best interests.\n\nJones first appeared on the public eye in the pages of the American Spectator, the ultra-conservative magazine funded by billionaire Richard Mellon Scaife that acted as the central cog in what Hillary Clinton would famously described as \u201ca vast right-wing conspiracy\u201d out to ruin her husband.\n\nIn a December 1993 article, \u201cHis Cheatin\u2019 Heart,\u201d by David Brock (a self-described reformed conservative who now supports Hillary Clinton), a former Arkansas state trooper described escorting a \u201cPaula\u201d to Bill Clinton\u2019s hotel room in 1991. When she emerged an hour later, according to the trooper, \u201cPaula told him she was available to be Clinton\u2019s regular girlfriend if he so desired.\u201d (Brock did not respond to requests for comment from The Daily Beast for this article.)\n\nThe story only used her first name\u2014an inclusion the Spectator editor in chief would later admit was an \u201ceditorial mistake\u201d\u2014but Little Rock was a small place and everyone, Jones thought, knew who the trooper was talking about. She\u2019d never had sex with Clinton, as the article implied; in fact, she told family and friends, when the governor allegedly dropped his pants and asked her to \u201ckiss it,\u201d that she had rejected him. So at a friend\u2019s suggestion, Jones sought legal counsel \u201cto clear her good name.\u201d\n\nBill Clinton had been president for a year, and amassed plenty of enemies on his way to the White House. And Jones soon found that a horde of Clinton\u2019s adversaries were happy to champion her cause.\n\nJones and her lawyer held a press conference at the Conservative Political Action Conference. Jones then went on Pat Robertson\u2019s 700 Club, telling the televangelist, \u201cI felt raped. Whether he touched me or not, it was disgusting what he did.\u201d Anti-abortion group Operation Rescue\u2019s leader Patrick Mahoney created a legal defense fund for Jones, because he said, \u201csexual harassment is wrong.\u201d (Mahoney has not formally endorsed a candidate in 2016, but on Twitter, called Trump\u2019s behavior toward women during the campaign, \u201ctroubling and shameful.\u201d Roberston defended Trump on his program last week, dismissing the leaked video as \u201cmacho talk.\u201d)\n\nShe also appeared on National Empowerment Television, a precursor to InfoWars that peddled in Clinton conspiracy theories alleging the Clintons to be murderers. Accuracy in Media, a conservative media watchdog, spent thousands on newspaper ads criticizing the hypocrisy of the liberal media for covering Anita Hill\u2019s complaints while ignoring those from Jones.\n\nAnd Southern Baptist Old Time Gospel Hour televangelist Jerry Falwell, founder of Moral Majority, a political organization for religious conservatives, paid for, distributed, and tirelessly promoted The Clinton Chronicles, a truth-lite \u201cdocumentary\u201d which accused the president of being a drug-running, murderous womanizer, and prominently featured Jones and her husband, Steve. The tape sold for a donation of $40 plus $3 shipping and handling.\n\nThe reaction from the left to Jones\u2019 $700,000 civil suit against President Clinton\u2014filed just days before the statute of limitations would run out\u2014was equal and opposite from the support she received by the far-right.\n\nClinton\u2019s camp was cruel. Longtime loyalist James Carville famously said of Jones, \u201cIf you drag a hundred-dollar bill through a trailer park, you never know what you\u2019ll find.\u201d\n\nAnd women\u2019s-rights groups were noticeably silent. Susan Estrich, a lawyer and feminist pioneer, wrote in Slate, \u201cThis is just one more political assault on the president, politically motivated and politically pursued. You can\u2019t tell me this woman didn\u2019t know whom she was hiring as a lawyer, whom she was allying herself with, whom she was using, and who being used by.\u201d This year Estrich colorfully referred to Trump as \u201cthe most vulgar, rude, offensive, racist, bombastic, insensitive, unqualified, disrespectful boor ever to be nominated by a major party in our lifetimes\u201d\u2014then baffled feminists when she signed on to defend Roger Ailes against a sexual-harassment lawsuit brought by anchor Gretchen Carlson that led to the Fox News founder\u2019s ouster.\n\nWhile not offering their exact support, eventually the National Organization for Women, which stood by Clinton, told the president\u2019s supporters they had gone too far in their bashing of Jones. NOW President Patricia Ireland told the New York Daily News in 1997, \u201cI would urge President Clinton to rein in his lawyers on this,\u201d calling their threats to dig up further dirt on Jones in response to a defamation suit she brought, an \u201cinappropriate and disappointing strategy using the so-called \u2018nuts and sluts\u2019 defense.\u201d\n\nBut none of it compared to Jones\u2019s Penthouse treatment.\n\nLess than a year after coming forward, Jones\u2019s lawyers were fighting to keep 12 nude photos of their client from being published. Penthouse argued the photos were protected by free-speech laws because of their newsworthiness\u2014ostensibly that they betrayed Jones\u2019s true character and undermined her \u201cI\u2019m not that kind of girl\u201d defense. Jones\u2019s lawyers contended publishing the photos, taken when Jones was 19 years old by her 31-year-old boyfriend, was a violation of New York privacy laws. A judge disagreed.\n\n\u201cPublication of these photos was the functional equivalent of a rape\u2014a public raping of Paula Jones\u2014where the rapist instead of being punished gets paid for his behavior,\u201d Jones\u2019s attorney Joseph Cammarata said in response to the ruling. (Cammarata is currently representing seven women who say they were sexually assaulted by Bill Cosby.)\n\nWhile Jones was trying to repair her reputation, the 1995 article that accompanied the photos sought to destroy it. Through dozens of anecdotes\u2014provided by Jones\u2019s brother-in-law, former boyfriends, neighbors, even a manager at the shoe store where she once worked\u2014writer Rudy Maxa crafted a profile of Jones as a \u201csmall-town vamp.\u201d For rural Arkansas, Jones\u2019s makeup and short skirts, her devil-may-care attitude, and popularity with boys all added up to something.\n\n\u201cJones\u2019s accusations, detailed in a lawsuit filed against Clinton last spring, did nothing to to help raise the public\u2019s perception of the president\u2019s character,\u201d Maxa wrote. \u201cBut what about Paula Jones\u2019s character?\u2026 What about Paula Jones\u2019s reputation?\u201d\n\nTo add insult to injury, Penthouse reprinted the photos in April 1998, the month a federal district judge dismissed Jones\u2019s case. (She would appeal.) For this, Maxa went back to Arkansas for more local dirt on Jones\u2019s alleged promiscuity and again rehashed back-fence gossip about her tight dresses and loose morals. Even the headline, \u201cThe Devil in Paula Jones,\u201d was the same.\n\nMaxa wondered once more: Why had Paula Jones waited so long to come forward? And why had she not been more upset when telling family what Bill Clinton had allegedly asked of her in that hotel room? But he included new details, too: She\u2019d supposedly had sex in a car once; Jones\u2019s landlord said the Joneses never had money; her handyman allegedly said Jones flirted with him.\n\nAccording to the unnamed handyman, Jones responded to his rejection of her advances with, \u201cYou men\u2026 I can get back at you, you\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\n(If this seems like an unlikely quote, a look at Maxa\u2019s own record raises further questions concerning the Penthouse writer\u2019s dedication to facts and accuracy. Two months after the Jones story, Penthouse retracted an equally explosive article from Maxa on New York Episcopal priests who, he reported, had engaged in homosexual orgies with Brazilian men. Most of the allegations were found to be untrue. In 1991, he left or was booted from his gig at Washingtonian magazine shortly after the publication printed an apology and settled a libel suit with Washington Redskins owner Jack Kent Cooke over a profile that painted him as racist who knew about the fixing of football games.)\n\nAfter the Penthouse shaming, some of Jones\u2019s staunchest conservative supporters turned their backs on her; among them, Operation Rescue\u2019s Rick Mahoney, who set up Paula\u2019s first legal defense fund. \u201cAll the sudden these pictures surface and and then they dumped me like a hot potato,\u201d Jones would later explain to Joe Conason. \u201cI guess because I was dirty and this and that\u2026\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Jones\u2019s harassment suit was being commandeered for a greater cause\u2014the takedown of a president. The search for evidence in Jones\u2019s case uncovered the affair between the president and Monica Lewinsky, and the discovery that Clinton had lied under oath about his relationship with the White House intern, which in turn led to independent counsel Kenneth Starr\u2019s report and Clinton\u2019s impeachment.\n\nThings were moving fast for Jones, and it wasn\u2019t always clear just who was in control of her case. In 1997, Jones was being represented by Gilbert Davis and Joseph Cammarata\u2014two moderate Republicans who suggested that Jones accept a settlement offer of $700,000. For her part, Jones later said, \u201cOh, I instructed them many times to try and get the case settled\u2026\u201d\n\nBut there were other lawyers steering the ship from behind the scenes, a group of young conservatives who referred to themselves as Elves (as in the muscle and magic that runs Santa\u2019s workshop). These elves included George Conway\u2014husband to Kellyanne Conway, Trump\u2019s third and current campaign manager who has defended Trump\u2019s trotting out of Jones and the other women, telling Anderson Cooper, \u201cI believe that voters should know who Hillary Clinton is.\u201d George Conway wrote the Supreme Court brief that allowed Jones\u2019s case to continue and leaked to Matt Drudge details of a sealed affidavit that would later be used to discredit Jones\u2014one in which she described a \u201cdistinguishing characteristic\u201d of the president\u2019s penis, specifically a bend, a condition that doctors who examined Clinton disputed.\n\nAnother \u201cElf,\u201d now-famous conservative firebrand Ann Coulter, was little-known outside far-right DC circles at the time, but made no secret of her distaste for the quick settlement that Jones said she always wanted.\n\nIn Michael Isikoff\u2019s Uncovering Clinton, Coulter called news of a settlement \u201ca fucking disaster!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were terrified that Jones would settle,\u201d Coulter reportedly said. \u201cIt was contrary to our purpose of bringing down the president.\u201d\n\nWhile other accounts downplay Coulter\u2019s actual contributions, Bob Guccione Jr., the eldest son to Penthouse magazine\u2019s publisher, and one-time boyfriend to Coulter in the \u201990s, said the blonde political commentator was clear about her role then, and what she thought of Jones.\n\n\u201c[Coulter] boasted about surreptitiously writing Jones\u2019s legal complaint with a couple of her conservative lawyer friends in DC,\u201d Guccione Jr. told The Daily Beast. \u201cShe bemoaned that Jones made a fool of herself in the media, because not only had she not been involved in writing her own complaint, she hadn\u2019t bothered to read it when it was done.\u201d\n\nCoulter did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhen Susan Carpenter McMillan, an antiabortion activist who had befriended Jones, got wind of a settlement in the spring of 1997, she officially signed on as her official spokesperson, telling Jones\u2019s lawyers: \u201cI\u2019m on board. You don\u2019t have to like it, you don\u2019t have to approve of it. I\u2019m here. I\u2019m going to defend her.\u201d\n\nJones\u2019s advisers and husband convinced her not to take the 1997 settlement, leading her attorneys, Davis and Cammarata, to quit. McMillan held a press conference in front of her home to announce the split.\n\nNo case was more publicized at the time, and Jones\u2019s case was quickly taken over by Dallas lawyers provided by conservative a Christian legal organization, the Rutherford Institute, whose first order of business involved sending out direct-mail requests for donations. When the money didn\u2019t come rolling in\u2014they only collected $300,000\u2014Rutherford President John Whitehead could only guess why.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a sexual angle to the case that bothers some people,\u201d Whitehead told the Associated Press. \u201cI thought I would have people patting me on the back\u2026 but I haven\u2019t heard a thing from anybody.\u201d\n\nWhen a settlement was finally reached in 1998, Jones had incurred hundreds of thousands of dollars of unnecessary debt. Her reputation was ruined: She was mocked mercilessly on late-night television, and in a 1998 national poll, only a quarter of Americans said they believed Jones was telling the truth. After legal fees, her $850,000 settlement turned into $151,000, and because of mismanagement of one of her legal defense funds, Jones owed thousands in taxes and penalties to the IRS.\n\nA year after the settlement, Jones was an unemployed, broke, divorced mother of two boys, and all her conservative friends had disappeared. So she agreed to pose for a tasteful spread in the very magazine that she had sued to stay out of, the same one that had disparaged her twice before. The money, she said, would be used for her sons\u2019 college funds.\n\nUpon hearing Jones was posing for Penthouse, conservatives who had abandoned her in droves, began to actively attack her. Ann Coulter made her disdain public, writing, \u201c[Jones] used to be a hero in a David and Goliath conflict. She used to have dignity and nobility and tremendous courage. Now she\u2019s just the trailer-park trash they said she was.\u201d\n\nIn 2000, Jones sat down for an accompanying Penthouse interview with Joe Conason, coauthor of that same year\u2019s The Hunting of the President: The Ten-Year Campaign to Destroy Bill and Hillary Clinton. Jones still thought she had been \u201cdone wrong\u201d by the Clintons and their attack machine, but she seemed to have also grown wary of the right, concluding, \u201cI was used by a lot of people to get to him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel like I came out with the wrong end of the stick, you know?\u201d she said.\n\nBut that was then. These days, though many of the players are the same, Jones seems like a woman on her own mission. Jones came out against Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential bid in a 2015 interview with the Daily Mail and told Inside Edition in September, \u201cI am a big Trump supporter, I think he would be our next best president since Ronald Reagan.\u201d\n\nAfter joining Trump\u2019s impromptu press conference last week, Jones appeared with the same women on non-journalist Sean Hannity\u2019s Fox News show. There, Jones alluded to the conspiracy theories first pushed in the Clinton Chronicles in which she appeared decades ago: \u201cThere\u2019s been so many things to happen to so many people that are connected to the Clintons.\u201d When Hannity asked if Jones fears for her own life, she answered, \u201cAbsolutely I feel that way if she becomes the president. She\u2019s going the rule the world.\u201d\n\nJones declined an interview with The Daily Beast. Her husband, with whom she lives in Arkansas, Steven McFadden, told me that Jones is cautious these days when it comes to the media, but in a brief telephone call, praised his wife for weathering more than most could imagine.\n\n\u201cPaula\u2019s definitely a strong lady. She\u2019s not one that you want to back into a corner,\u201d McFadden said.\n\nJones hasn\u2019t commented on the spate of women who came forward last week with stories alleging Donald Trump had sexually assaulted them, or his denials, which routinely invoke the unattractiveness of his accusers\u2014a tactic with which Jones, ridiculed mercilessly for her appearance and social class, should feel all too familiar.\n\nShe\u2019s also stayed quiet regarding the recently rediscovered tapes of Trump disparaging her in the press. In 1998 on Fox News, Trump said that Bill Clinton himself had been a victim of a \u201ctruly an unattractive cast of characters,\u201d naming Jones among them. He was more direct on MSNBC, telling Chris Matthews in 1998, \u201cPaula Jones is a loser.\u201d\n\nStill, if Jones harbors any animosity toward the Republican nominee or his alt-right backers who, not so long ago, used her for their own political agendas, she hasn\u2019t made it known. For Jones, whatever happened in that Little Rock hotel room\u2014and the price she ultimately paid for it\u2014seems to trump all.\n\nTatyana Bellamy-Walker contributed research."
