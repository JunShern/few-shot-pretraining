We think they\u2019re pretty great out of the box, but we also know that there are often things that could make them even better for how folks like yourself use them in the real world. Our tools help the right people, get to the right place at the right time. How can we improve our products and make them super awesome for you and your users? That\u2019s where we can use your help!\n\nIf there are features that our products do not currently support but you think would be a huge added value for you and lots of other people, then please share them here with us. The submission form will walk you through a few quick questions to get the ball rolling.\n\nBefore posting your idea, here are a few tips that will help make your request stand out and succeed:\n\nLook to see if someone else has suggested the same idea, or something very similar. Many ideas are being submitted and it\u2019s very possible that another request already exists. In that case, add your vote to the existing request.\n\nBe as descriptive as possible. What does the feature do? Where would it be located? Who would use it? How does this improve the overall experience of managing an events calendar in WordPress?\n\nUse mockups, if possible. Pictures are worth a thousand words and having a visual often brings a greater level of clarity to an idea.\n\nPlease not, this is not a place to get support or ask questions about how the plugin works. If you need help, please visit our help desk. If you use our free core plugin, you can post in our forum on WordPress.org.\n\nI suggest you ...\n\nEnter your idea\n\n(thinking\u2026)\n\nEnter your idea and we'll search to see if someone has already suggested it.\n\nIf a similar idea already exists, you can support and comment on it.\n\nIf it doesn't exist, you can post your idea so others can support it.\n\nEnter your idea and we'll search to see if someone has already suggested it.\n\nim am just looking at the german translation for now:\non the main page of your events there is a dropdown menu which can be used to filter events for a special month or filter them by a word.\nthe translation in the dropdown menu is not complete.\nIt says\n1. \"Show Veranstaltungen Search\"\nit should be (correct german would be):\n\"Veranstaltungen durchsuchen\"\n2. \"Hide Veranstaltungen Search\"\nit should be (correct german would be):\n\"Suche ausblenden\""
