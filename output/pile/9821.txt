    "text": "Metro trains have run red lights dozens of times since the beginning of 2012, according to federal officials, who said more needs to be done to reduce the dangerous trend. (Linda Davidson/The Washington Post)\n\nMetro operator No. 012008 had been on the job for eight months when she hopped into the cab of the wrong train on July 4, hit the power and ran a red light on her way to pick up passengers headed for celebrations on the Mall.\n\nTwo months later, in September 2014, a Silver Line train operator with 11 years of experience rolled through a red signal and stopped just before a stretch of track that seconds earlier had an oncoming train.\n\nThis month , an operator ran a light near the Smithsonian Metro station and came to a stop only after realizing that his train was on a collision course with another train. He stopped 189 feet short of the second train, which was waiting at the platform, loaded with passengers.\n\nThere have been at least 47 \u201cred signal violations\u201d since the beginning of 2012, according to the Federal Transit Administration, which took responsibility for the safety of Metro\u2019s rail system last year and cited the \u201cpervasiveness and seriousness of this problem,\u201d despite years of warnings and efforts to address it.\n\n[Multiple human errors cited in low-speed close call]\n\nTo address the persistent problem of red light running, Metro added stickers in train cabs to remind operators of the rules. (Photo by Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority )\n\nThe question is: Why? How can something so critical, and potentially dangerous, keep happening?\n\nThe answer, according to dozens of incident reports and the results of an outside investigation obtained through public records requests, has plenty of intricacies and contributing factors, and one unifying theme: Like most of us, Metrorail train operators sometimes tune out and get lost in their thoughts. The difference is that they are responsible for the lives of hundreds of people riding in 200-ton trains. Sometimes they sink into habit, move by instinct and fail to see what\u2019s right before their eyes, investigators found.\n\nThe repeated human errors, and their effect on safety, prompted Metro officials to hire a neuroscientist and an outside safety expert to try to tease out exactly what is causing the \u00adlapses. While the hazards of multi\u00adtasking, such as using a cellphone while driving, are well known, researchers have found that simply thinking about something else is enough to be a real distraction.\n\n\u201cA lot of times, people don\u2019t realize that when they\u2019re tuning out \u2014 and it can be something as simple as mind wandering \u2014 people don\u2019t realize this actually puts them at risk,\u201d said Daniel Smilek, an associate professor of cognitive neuroscience at the University of Waterloo in Ontario.\n\nSmilek and partner Randall Jamieson, who run the Atticus Consulting Group, were hired by Metro to help translate the latest academic findings to the transit agency\u2019s real-world problem. \u201cWe can show that basically whenever you mind wander, even in very simple tasks, your performance will deteriorate in those tasks,\u201d Smilek said.\n\nThe draft findings from their investigation point to numerous \u201cattention-related errors.\u201d Time after time, Metro operators took off from a platform or other stop \u201cwithout full conscious awareness\u201d of what they were doing, the consultants found. Operators, supervisors and managers also lack an \u201cunderstanding of how human attention works and under what circumstances it is likely to fail.\u201d\n\nSimilar challenges trouble Transportation Security Administration agents gazing at X-ray images and surgeons peering into incisions. But for Metro, which faces broader management and safety issues highlighted by its botched handling of a deadly smoke incident last year, the problem has raised concerns about whether other safety procedures are being followed.\n\nThe Washington Post\u2019s transportation reporter Dana Hedgpeth gives us the backstory to the much-maligned mass transit system. The bad news? The long waits in the tunnel aren\u2019t going away anytime soon. The good news? Metro is faster than you thought. (Brad Horn/The Washington Post)\n\n[Metro fans pulled smoke toward passengers on train at L\u2019Enfant]\n\nThe Tri-State Oversight Committee, a safety panel made up of officials from Maryland, Virginia and the District, has pressed Metro for years to tackle the problem aggressively, arguing that whatever it is about Metro that allows repeated red-light running could also lead to unsafe behavior elsewhere.\n\n\u201cWe would characterize all red signal violations as a hazardous circumstance, close call, or near miss,\u201d the oversight group said in a statement. \u201cSuch patterns of non\u00adcompliance may indicate systemic issues regarding the culture of rule compliance and enforcement.\u201d\n\nWhat one operator called \u201ca big rush-rush culture\u201d in the nation\u2019s second-busiest subway proved to be \u201ca significant systemic cause\u201d in most cases of red-light running, the Atticus investigation concluded. The report also pointed to inadequate supervision of operators and controllers, leading to continued miscommunication.\n\nCritical \u2018perceptual error\u2019\n\nThe causes are multifaceted, and even those at fault sometimes cannot believe what investigators found.\n\nAn operator who ran a red light between the Reagan National Airport and Crystal City Metro stations in August 2014 became \u201cextremely defensive\u201d when pressed on the circumstances, according to the report.\n\nHe insisted that he had not run the red light. He was certain he had the rail equivalent of a green light.\n\nBut a technical re-creation provided \u201cirrefutable evidence to the contrary,\u201d according to the consultants, who said they were worried about the operator\u2019s \u201congoing refusal\u201d to acknowledge his responsibility \u2014 or reality.\n\nSo they walked him through it, framed more as a lesson than an inquisition.\n\nThe root cause? He made his train announcements, shut the doors, sat down and immediately pushed the accelerator without paying proper attention.\n\nThere also was a critical \u201cperceptual error.\u201d\n\nMetro was single-tracking, meaning that trains going opposite directions must wait their turn. Based on experience, they found, the operator \u201chad the expectation that he would depart\u201d just after the opposing train arrived.\n\nWhich he did. Right through a red light.\n\nHe had no idea a second train was trailing the first, also headed his way. Additional safety systems kicked in, and he was instructed to pull back out of the way.\n\nThe consultants also cited a \u201csystemic cause.\u201d\n\nIt \u201cmay have been prudent,\u201d they wrote, for the Rail Operations Control Center to share more information. It was a \u201cnovel situation\u201d to be \u201cfleeting\u201d a pair of trains toward the airport, and the operator could have used that information.\n\n\u2018One is not acceptable\u2019\n\nMetro officials emphasize that they have a multi\u00adlayered system to keep passengers safe, including technology designed to stop trains when humans fall short. And oversight officials say they have seen no examples of the automated technology failing in red-light incidents.\n\nBut the systems don\u2019t help in all situations.\n\nIn this month\u2019s incident near Smithsonian, the train was moving in the reverse direction to avoid a problem ahead. The operator misheard an instruction from his controller about which station to go to. When the operator repeated the mangled instruction, the controller didn\u2019t catch the mistake, allowing the operator to head toward the wrong station. While headed there, he ran the red-light signal.\n\nThe safety system does not take over in such circumstances, officials said. But the operator, traveling at 10 mph, was able to stop in time.\n\nMetro\u2019s deputy general manager, Rob Troup, in an interview Feb. 11, hours before announcing his resignation, said behavioral concerns are universal. In recent years, Metro increased training and added placards in train cabs reminding operators that red means \u201cSTOP YOUR TRAIN.\u201d\n\nIn \u201cevery operating environment \u2014 whether it be aviation, freight railroads, transit railroads, class-one railroads, truck drivers, it doesn\u2019t matter \u2014 the human-error element is the hardest thing that you deal with,\u201d Troup said. Management, engineering, audits, rules and procedures all have a role in eliminating the incidents, he said.\n\nCiting \u201can exchange of information we have with other properties,\u201d Troup said that Metro has \u201csignificantly\u201d fewer red-light violations than its peers, although he declined to name the other systems. Still, he said, \u201cit\u2019s not acceptable to me. One is not acceptable to me.\u201d\n\nThe Federal Transit Administration said in a statement that such violations are not systematically reported to its transit database, making it \u201cdifficult to compare different rail transit agencies.\u201d\n\nStill, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority has a problem, the FTA said.\n\n\u201cRed signal violations are a serious safety concern and WMATA\u2019s trend line is going in the wrong direction. WMATA had more red signal overruns in 2015 than in either of the preceding two years,\u201d according to the statement.\n\n\u2018Operating on auto\u00adpilot\u2019\n\nBack on July 4, 2014, things were \u201cparticularly hectic\u201d at the Shady Grove rail yard in suburban Maryland, the consultants found.\n\nAn official responsible for guiding train operators through the vast yard was distracted by a disabled train and the gargantuan task of carrying tens of thousands of holiday revelers. It was also operator No. 012008\u2019s first time working there.\n\nShe was supposed to hop aboard a train on Track 15 but boarded one on Track 14 instead.\n\nThe operator twice radioed the operations official with the number of the signal in front of her, a basic safety step. But the official didn\u2019t notice that she was saying the wrong signal number, because she was on the wrong track, and didn\u2019t try to stop her.\n\nThe operator said later that she \u201cwas just trusting the tower\u201d when she hit the accelerator. No one was hurt. The guiding official was \u201cdisqualified\u201d from the job. The operator was retrained.\n\nThe consultants, hired for $19,800, re\u00adexamined and rewrote 11 of Metro\u2019s investigative reports and found that officials rarely delved into crucial questions of mental readiness and sometimes reached the wrong conclusion.\n\nIn one case, Metro officials told an operator traveling for the first time in a District rail yard that \u201cyou were not focused and paying attention to the safe operation of your train.\u201d\n\nBut the consultants said the new operator was actually so anxious about being on unfamiliar ground and so focused on finding the right place to stop that he was \u201ceffectively psychologically blind\u201d to the red light.\n\nAnother operator was, in essence, too familiar with the station where she ran the light.\n\n\u201cThe more you do it, the more you relax from thinking,\u201d she told the Atticus investigators, who concluded that as time goes by, she is \u201clikely to rely on her habitual, routine past experiences \u2014 in other words \u2018operating on auto\u00adpilot.\u2019 \u201d\n\nFor a Silver Line operator and 11-year veteran, her near miss came after a supervisor cut short her break and then spurred her further by saying she was \u201cdue off platform a couple minutes ago,\u201d the consultants found.\n\n[Read the report on the Silver Line near miss]\n\nTo address the \u201cbig rush-rush culture,\u201d Metro recently tweaked its schedule to allow operators more time to do train walk-arounds and safety checks before their first run. Metro also set up a new system in which operators can hand off their train to a fresh colleague at the end of the line \u201cshould an operator need relief.\u201d\n\nAfter finding examples of stress and excitability among operators, Atticus also said operators need better training to handle such \u201cadverse mental states.\u201d Metro is considering that.\n\nMinutes before her break was truncated, the Silver Line operator had another jolt. Her supervisor told her that she must \u201csubmit an incident report in response to a complaint that had been levied against her by a fellow employee as a result of an altercation\u201d that day, the report said.\n\nJust before she ran the light, she was worrying about being disciplined, she recalled, although she didn\u2019t think it caused her mistake. The consultants weren\u2019t so sure. They said they have investigated numerous errors \u201cshortly after a worrisome or disturbing communication\u201d from a boss or relative.\n\nWhen you\u2019re thinking about something other than the job at hand, Smilek said, \u201csome of your processing capacity is taken up,\u201d particularly when something affects you deeply. Like a bank account, a brain\u2019s processing power has limits, he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t allocate it to too many things, otherwise you just run out of money.\u201d"
