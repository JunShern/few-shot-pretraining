    "text": "1. Field of the Invention\nThe present invention relates to route data processing technology and more specifically, to a route data compression method for compressing recording points for recording a route to reduce the amount of storage data by means of setting the values of predetermined distance, predetermined angle and predetermined number of compression points and then determining whether or not the distance between every two recording points is greater than the predetermined distance and whether or not the contained angle of the two link lines of every three recording points is greater than the predetermined angle.\n2. Description of the Related Art\nFollowing fast development of modern technology, many different electronic products are created to serve people, bringing more convenience to the people in their daily life. For example, many different advanced satellite navigation systems have been created following the development of satellite navigation technology. These advanced satellite navigation systems provide dramatic improvement in navigation quality, operation interface, display mode and size, attracting people to buy. Nowadays, most new cars are equipped with a satellite navigation system as a standard equipment. A satellite navigation system can receive a geographic coordinate data signal from an artificial satellite, compare the geographic coordinate data to its internal map database, and then display the location on a map. A satellite navigation system has a local area map database. When started the navigation software, the user can input the name or address of the destination, enabling the satellite navigation system to produce a line of route planning data. To a person who is not familiar with the road conditions, he or she can use the map of a satellite navigation system to guide the traveling to the destination.\nHowever, the navigation mapping software programs of modern satellite navigation systems or electronic devices (desk computers, notebook computers, PDAs or servers) provide a 3D actual view simulation and different route planning modes, thereby increasing program capacity and complicating the computation procedure. In consequence, much data storage capacity is necessary for recording the data and a relatively higher operating power of central processing speed must be used, resulting in a rise in cost. Further, when the amount of storage data is increased, the data transmission speed will be lowered, leading to trouble.\nTherefore, it is desirable to provide a method for use in the processing of route planning data to reduce memory space occupation, thereby eliminating the aforesaid problems."
