    "text": "Auditions for \u201cThe Tell-Tale Farce\u201d\n\nDue to today\u2019s announcements from state and local governments, we are taking the step of postponing our \u201cThe Tell Tale Farce\u201d auditions, currently scheduled for March 22nd and 23rd. At this time, no new date(s) have been selected.\n\nStay tuned for more details in the future as our board of directors make these unprecedented decisions.\n\nAnnouncing the audition dates for The Village Players of Hatboro\u2019s production of The Tell-Tale Farce, a comedy by Don Zolidis.\n\nAudition Dates\n\nSHOW DATES are June (2020) 5, 6, 7, 12, 13, 14, 19, 20. All actors who are cast MUST be available for all show dates, as well as tech week (Sunday, May 31st through Wednesday, June 3rd)\n\nREHEARSALS will be decided based upon actor availability.\n\nSYNOPSIS\n\n(Farce) It\u2019s 1848, and Edgar Allan Poe is just coming off the spectacular success of \u201cThe Raven.\u201d Unfortunately, it\u2019s only earned him a grand total of nine dollars. So when a wealthy dowager commissions him to write her a poem for the vast sum of one hundred dollars, he leaps at the chance. Only problem: the man who shows up to write the poem isn\u2019t Poe, he\u2019s Poe\u2019s mailman, and he\u2019s on a quest to woo the dowager\u2019s spinster niece. Playing Poe is harder than it looks, though, especially when your mustache keeps falling off, the teenage grand-daughter of the house is lusting after you, and Poe\u2019s arch-nemesis, Rufus Griswold, just happens to be dropping by to settle old scores. A freewheeling, door-slamming farce with a touch of the macabre.\n\nCHARACTER DESCRIPTIONS\n\nPoe (The real one) \u2013 late 30s, fresh off the success of \u201cThe Raven\u201d. A rather mild-mannered fellow with a mustache.\n\nRufus Griswold \u2013 Late 30s, a poet. Something of a bastard. Has amazing facial hair with mustache.\n\nHenry Whitford \u2013 20, nervous and naive. No mustache.\n\nMary O\u2019Donnell \u2013 20s, the chambermaid. Irish accent.\n\nHelena Dowling \u2013 62, the matriarch, nearly deaf. Walks with a cane.\n\nSarah Dowling \u2013 30ish, Helena\u2019s niece. A spinster.\n\nAbigail Dowling \u2013 18, granddaughter of Helena.\n\nCREW MEMBERS & NEWBIES\n\nAudition nights are a perfect time to come out, meet the director, and express your interest in helping out backstage, be it in the role of a stage manager, lights & sound operator, concessions, or whatever else you might like to do.\n\nThey\u2019re also GREAT for first-timers to come out and observe how things are done, maybe express interest in being a helper, or read for a part! We almost always cast at least one person who\u2019s never been on stage before. You never know what can happen!"
