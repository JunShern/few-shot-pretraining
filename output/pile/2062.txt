    "text": "adidas adiZero Adios Boost review \u2013 good just got better\n\nI think that to a greater or lesser extent, all runners are creatures of habit and that is never truer than when it comes to our choice of footwear. The advice from experts and non-experts alike is often: find what works for you and then stick with it.\n\nI have friends who find a shoe that they like and buy as many pairs as they can afford or justify \u2013 indeed at my club the demise of the ASICS Ohana resulted in panic buying the likes of which is only seen after the announcement of an impending tornado somewhere in the USA.\n\nOther friends, including some highly regarded reviewers, wail and lament when a shoe that they like is discontinued or even just changed a little, as though the business decision about the shoe was a personal attack on them!\n\nI have my favourites too\n\nAnd I can sometimes see why. Whilst I do tend to look down on runners who put any success they achieve down to lucky pants or the fact that they have had the same vest since 1962, I do tend to get used to a pair of shoes and not really want to change.\n\nMy first Adios\u2026\n\nWhen the original adidas adiZero Adios came out, all the faster runners at my club got a pair. I wanted a pair. They were too narrow for my Hobbit like plates of meat. I was gutted. Not only did they look cool but all the fastest people in the world were wearing them. Probably more importantly, the fastest people in my club and on the start lines of races I was running were wearing them.\n\nIn search of the perfect racing shoe\n\nBut I wasn\u2019t able to join in the fun, so I kept looking for my ideal racing flat. I tried the Brooks T7 Racer and I liked them \u2013 but they were a little too flat for me. I went back to ASICS and raced in the Gel Hyperspeed but for the marathon they didn\u2019t offer enough in the way of cushioning for me. The Mizuno Wave Ronin was a favourite for quite a while.\n\nBut then I heard a wonderful thing \u2013 there would be a range of adiZero Adios Wide\u2026 a troll-feet special! So I went to the adidas store on Oxford Street and there they were. The shoe I had been waiting for. I went crazy and bought two pairs in one go, because my man on the inside at adidas told me that the supply would be limited.\n\nAnd so there I was, at the end of the Olympic year in London, training and racing in my new Adios Wides and dreaming of the London marathon in April 2013. What I would do in my new, light, responsive, comfortable movers. Then I found myself in New York, invited to the launch of the adidas Boost. Moreover I found myself sitting next to the man in charge of running at adidas for Europe. And he told me that if I liked the Boost (I did and still do) and the adiZero Adios (I did and I still do), then I would love the Adios Boost\u2026\n\nIf Carlsberg made running shoes\n\nThe Boost midsole material\n\nWHAT!?!!?? All the things I love about the Adios \u2013 the perfect heel-toe offset, the light weight, the open-mesh upper \u2013 but with a Boost sole? I was really keen to get a pair on my feet.\n\nWell now I have and I can report that unlike so many combinations that sound alright on paper but are a disaster in reality, the adidas Adios Boost is a triumph.\n\nThe shoe is everything that I loved about the adiZero Adios but with a firmer and more responsive feeling midsole. The shoe has the Continental rubber that certainly makes the shoe feel more grippy and if anything seems to have an even more open upper which keeps my feet lovely and aerated.\n\nIf I have one tiny criticism, it is that if I am not very careful, the tongue, being really light, can roll at the edges and then there is a gap either side which allows the laces to rub against the top of the foot. But careful tongue placement (oh er missus) sorts that out.\n\nIn the races and sessions I have done so far in these shoes, they have felt great and that is despite there not being \u2013 as far as I know \u2013 a \u2018wide\u2019 version. I suspect that the new shoe is a little wider than the earlier adiZero Adios, which is great for me and the open mesh upper is probably also a little more forgiving. It probably also helps that these shoes are so striking looking.\n\nConclusion\n\nFor me, I think that adidas have done a great thing bringing their Boost technology and the design of the Adios together. I have sometimes thought that adidas has perhaps too wide a range of racing shoes and if they were to ask my opinion, I would say that they could do away with all the others and concentrate entirely on the Adios Boost. But then if they did, that would probably send me on a panic buying spree in case they sold out and I can not afford that, so adidas if you are reading this, please make sure you save a few pairs just for me\u2026 danke!\n\nHi Simon, seriously tempted by a pair of energy boost. As a fairly heavy set runner with high arches and neutral gait/supination, could you say a little about the rest of the boost range? The adios being lower drop I think? Currently have Brooks glycerin9 and pureflow2 for the quicker ones.\n\nTom, sorry for the slow reply. I have to say first of all I think the Brooks is a great shoe. Personally I am not all that keen on the Pure Flow (indeed the entire Pure Project has not really floated my boat) but from what I have tried, I would say they are very different shoes to the Boost range.\n\nThe adios Boost is a really marvelous shoe in my opinion. I also really like the Supernove Glide Boost for regular runs and anything up to a fast\u2019ish tempo session. They are more traditional than the Pure project shoes, but well worth a look I think. Would love to know if you like them if you give them a try.\n\nThanks Simon. I popped into a local Sweatshop to try them on actually, and was offered a gait analysis. Thought \u2018might as well!\u2019 so went ahead.\n\nThe results were a little troubling \u2013 about 2 years ago I started to get some knee pain, which led to physio, which led to a podiatrist session, which led to diagnosis of fairly bad supination (+ high arches), which led to recommending very cushioned shoes and corrective insoles.\n\nEvery member of staff in the shop I went to assured me I don\u2019t supinate, and in fact I overpronate, and need support shoes!\n\nThrough the podiatry and insoles I probably spent \u00a3200 on a false diagnosis, but much, much worse, was running and walking on potentially quite damaging insoles for 18 months.\n\nSo, in short, don\u2019t trust a podiatrist, get a second and third opinion!\n\nAnd on the shoes, energy boost are a bit too neutral it seems, so I\u2019m thinking Brooks Adrenaline GTS on the support side, or potentially Saucony Omni.\n\nHi, mildly concerned about the above. having performed staff training in many stores over several years and worked with many podiatrists I felt compelled to comment. a podiatrist has 3 years of training to do their job and whilst like any profession there are good ones and bad ones, a member of staff at the above store has training from between 0 and a few days..\n\nso firstly did the shoes and insoles from the Pod solve the problem? if not you should always go back and a good one will correct it for you. Secondly even if you had the wrong advice it is never a good plan to move from one end of the spectrum to the other if you are not injured. if you need more correction then move to moderate controlled shoe. (the brooks in question is one of the most controlling on the market, and whilst it is a great shoe for the correct runner it is often recommended when it shouldn\u2019t be.)\n\nI hope you reach a suitable solution.\n\nKen\n(BSc Sports Science, 23 years of running experience and 19 years in the running industry.)"
