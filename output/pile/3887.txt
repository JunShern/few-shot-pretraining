    "text": "A task analysis of the shift from teacher instructions to self-instructions in performing an in-common task.\nThree preschool children repeatedly did four kinds of sorts with a deck of stimulus cards: a difficult, untaught target sort and three other sorts considered analytic of self-instructing the target performance. The untaught target sort was to find in a deck of cards those matching what two sample cards had in common. Most preschool children must be taught to mediate this problem. The three other kinds of sorts taught skills involved in the target performance or its mediation. As correct self-instructive talk emerged in the target sorts, it was confirmed. The untaught target sorts were interspersed infrequently among the three alternating directly taught skill sorts, to see if accurate target sorts, and accurate self-instructive talk about the target sorts, would emerge as the three skill sorts were mastered. As all the sorts progressed, increasing accuracy was seen first in the skill sorts and then in the untaught target sorts. All three subjects showed subsequent generalization to new target sorts involving other stimulus sets. Correct spontaneous self-instructions about the target sorts increased from near zero at the beginning of the experiment to consistency at its end. Thus the three skill sorts appeared sufficient for the emergence of a self-instructed solution to the previously insoluble target performance."
