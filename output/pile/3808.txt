Part of the damage control operation has been to independently seek answers as to why batteries in some of its products were spontaneously catching fire, and a new round of investigations kicked off earlier this month. While faulty batteries seem to have been the catalyst, the company wanted to determine other factors that could have led to the explosions.\n\nSince launching the tablet phone in August, over 4.2 million Galaxy Note 7s have been sold globally, reports the Investor.
