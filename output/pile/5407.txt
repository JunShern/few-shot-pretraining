    "text": "Without discussing these concerns, they may find themselves in a situation where it\u2019s too late to change something that one or both partners don\u2019t like.\n\n1) \u201cWill we change with marriage?\u201d\n\nThe most common answer? Yes.\n\nOf course you and your partner will change with marriage.\n\nThe more important question is how your relationship will change after marriage.\n\nWith two people come two different sets of notions and ideas about marriage, whether this includes responsibilities, gender roles, your sex life, and so on.\n\nIn one study, it was found that major personality shifts generally occur after marriage.\n\nIt\u2019s important that you and your partner are on the same page when it comes to how you will evolve after your wedding day.\n\n2) \u201cWhat is cheating?\u201d\n\nThis may seem obvious, but the definition of \u201ccheating\u201d isn\u2019t as universal as we would like to think.\n\nSome people consider it cheating when you are touching someone on the shoulder, or sharing a personal secret with another person.\n\nOthers might not think of it as cheating until their partner is in bed with another person.\n\nRemember this: your expectations and thoughts on fidelity may not be the same as your partner\u2019s, and if that\u2019s important to you, then it\u2019s something you need to clear up before you disappoint your partner (or the other way around).\n\nThere are many cases of emotional affairs, where a partner invests themselves emotionally in another person. If this makes you uncomfortable, discuss it with your partner immediately.\n\n3) \u201cDo you have debt? If so, how much?\u201d\n\nMany young couples ultimately refuse to discuss money, thinking that it might dampen the \u201clove\u201d in their relationship.\n\nBut at some point it is crucial to grow up and be realistic: a relationship is more than just your emotions; it\u2019s also about spending your life with another person, and that means sharing costs and expenses.\n\nImagine getting married to someone you love, only to find out a week later that they are $50,000 in debt. Not a great picture, right?\n\nSit down with your partner and talk about debt. Whether you have any, and how much you are willing to take on.\n\n4) \u201cDo you want kids?\u201d\n\nTo some, kids are a basic component of life. They were raised with the belief that kids are a normal and expected part of any married couple\u2019s life.\n\nTo others, kids may simply be an option (or not an option at all). You may meet the love of your life, but if you avoid the question about kids, you and your partner may one day be in for a big surprise.\n\nHow terrible would it be to share a life with someone, only to find out that you two are incompatible because of kids? Don\u2019t let heartbreak or resentment become an inevitability.\n\n5) \u201cHow much personal time and space do we need?\u201d\n\nThe biggest change that we experience when we jump into a long-term and committed relationship is the change to our personal time and space.\n\nAll of a sudden, even your most personal moments now have another person in it. Even if that person is someone you deeply love and care about, you may not be ready to share all your time and space with another person.\n\nIf you want to be a good girlfriend or boyfriend, confront these questions and ask your partner how much time and space they truly need to be themselves.\n\nFailing to \u201cask less\u201d from your marriage can weaken it, according to one psychologist from Northwestern University.\n\n6) \u201cWho will do the chores?\u201d\n\nA 2007 poll from Pew Research found that one of the most important factors in predicting a successful marriage is how much the couple shares household chores.\n\nUnfortunately, many relationships fail to grasp this importance, with women still carrying the majority of the work around the home.\n\nBy sitting down with your partner and evenly dividing or assigning the chores, this eases tension and saves time from fighting about housework.\n\n7) \u201cWhat do you think about divorce?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a dirty question that many in relationships would never want to consider, but it\u2019s one that provides valuable insight into your partner.\n\nWhether or not you are planning to have a divorce, you need to know what your partner thinks about it.\n\nThe simple fact that you know that your relationship can have an end, with a clean divorce possible at the end of the road, provides a freedom that can keep both partners mentally healthy in their relationship.\n\nFor more mindful and practical self-improvement advice on your Facebook newsfeed, like Hack Spirit on Facebook:\n\nA quick message from Lachlan Brown, the founder of Hack Spirit\n\nIn 2018, the third year of Hack Spirit, I poured thousands of hours and considerable resources into creating these articles.
