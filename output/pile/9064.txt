    "text": "Chris Boardman says that transport planners need build segregated infrastructure to take account of the 60 per cent of people who say they would like to cycle but are put off by their perception that it is dangerous \u2013 but he warns that routes need to take people where they want to go without needless detours.\n\nThe former world and Olympic champion, now policy advisor to British Cycling, was speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme to internet pioneer Sir Tim Berners-Lee, who was guest editor of the Boxing Day edition of the show.\n\nThe pair, accompanied by the National Trust\u2019s director for London, Ivo Dawnay, undertook a journey on foot \u2013 Boardman had his bike with him too \u2013 from St James\u2019s Park, via Horse Guards Parade and Whitehall, to the Embankment.\n\nBerners-Lee was introduced on the programme as someone who \u201cenjoys riding a bike and\u2026 also drives a car, but he\u2019s not convinced that the two belong together on the roads.\u201d\n\nBoardman has been a regular visitor to London this year, including giving evidence to the All Party Parliamentary Cycling Group\u2019s Get Britain Cycling Inquiry and, more recently, the House of Commons Transport Select Committee.\n\nHe told Berners-Lee: \u201cThis is the first time in fact I\u2019ve brought my own bike [to London]. But having got here and just ridden across from Euston, it\u2019s not a pleasant experience, shall we say, everything is very tense.\u201d\n\nBerners-Lee asked Dawnay: \u201cWe\u2019re sitting in St James\u2019s Park and it\u2019s pleasant, it\u2019s car-free, so is one technique perhaps joining up these green spaces to make them into perhaps greenways for bikes?\u201d\n\nDawnay replied: \u201cThe green parts of London are either the Royal Parks or the London boroughs. But you\u2019re quite right, some places like Hyde Park Corner are actually quite hellish places to get over.\u201d\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that negotiating the road layout itself there can be very daunting, there are ways of avoiding the traffic, and the reality is that the Royal Parks do offer on- and off-road routes \u2013 the latter shared with people on foot \u2013 that do provide a pleasant way of getting across a large slice of the capital.\n\nHeading from Knightsbridge or out of Hyde Park towards Constitution Hill, for example, a prime commuting route in the morning, cyclists can use crossings to reach the island that the Wellington Arch is located on, then ride across to join the shared-use path running along the south side of Green Park.\n\nExiting St James\u2019s Park, Berners-Lee and his companions crossed Horse Guards Parade and under the arch of the Horse Guards building itself \u2013 not somewhere you can normally ride through, unless you\u2019re a member of the Household Cavalry on duty and on horseback \u2013 onto Whitehall.\n\n\u201cChris, we\u2019re on a bike, what do we do?\u201d asked Berners-Lee.\n\nBoardman responded: \u201cWell, it just got more complicated, we\u2019ve gone from that lovely quiet space over there and now we\u2019re moving back towards the traffic.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s huge congestion areas in London. Where we\u2019ve got much faster moving traffic, as we have here around Whitehall, that also presents a danger.\n\n\u201cThere seems to be more space, but there\u2019s more danger from traffic moving quickly as well.\u201d\n\nHeading down to the Embankment and looking for somewhere safe to cross, Boardman pointed out that it isn\u2019t just cyclists who are short-changed by the people who plan our roads.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to walk, what, 30, 50 metres in the opposite direction than we want to go to get across two lanes of quite fast moving traffic,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI almost feel like letting this piece run unedited so people can get a feel for how long it takes to get across a single road for a pedestrian.\u201d\n\nAsked by Berners-Lee his thoughts about the Embankment from a cyclist\u2019s viewpoint, he went on: \u201cWe\u2019ve got a huge, wide road here and it\u2019s being used at the moment by all types of traffic but there is space here, if we wanted to, to allocate it to different types of users.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what will happen if Mayor of London Boris Johnson\u2019s East-West route, running along the EMbankment then via St James's Park to Hyde Park Corner and dubbed \u2018Crossrail for the bike,\u2019 becomes reality, but the point being made by Boardman has a wider application.\n\n\u201cThe road space at the moment seems to be all about looking after cars,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe 2 per cent of people who ride on bikes now around the country, they\u2019re going to keep doing it no matter what, it\u2019s the 60 per cent who aren\u2019t sure, probably \u2018would if you gave me a nice space to do it,\u2019 they\u2019re the ones we should be targeting, and they want separated road space.\u201d\n\nBut, he added, thought needs to go into the process; routes have to get people from A to B in the way they want to go there, and not take well-intentioned but frustrating detours.\n\nHe cited the example of what are termed \u2018paths of desire\u2019 \u2013 look at an edge-of-town retail park surrounded by landscaping where arriving in anything but a car involves a longer-than-necessary walk and you\u2019ll see what he means.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen some beautiful infrastructure which costs millions of pounds and in some cases it will go round a piece of greenery and then across that green field there\u2019s a muddy patch right across the middle, and right there, that is human beings,\u201d he explained."
