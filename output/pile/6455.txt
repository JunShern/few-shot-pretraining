The organization is still desperately seeking permanent homes for these animals, as well as donations of money and supplies.\n\n\u201cSupport from the public is now more important than ever if Safe Haven is to protect and re-home animals in their care, which is often the last hope these animals have for safety,\u201d reads the board\u2019s statement.\n\nThe shelter is pointing to its strict \u201cno kill\u201d policy as the impetus for its financial woes.\n\n\u201cSafe Haven has chosen to take a more difficult road by giving animals a chance for a new home and a good life,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cEuthanasia of any healthy animal is not an option. Second chances, however, are not without cost.\u201d\n\nAccording to the statement, Safe Haven has, under its dog contract with Kent County, adopted out more than 400 dogs and cats \u201cwho would have almost certainly been euthanized by the previous contractor.\u201d\n\nThat previous contractor is the Kent County Society for the Prevention of Cruelty Animals, which holds the dog control contract for Sussex County and stood to re-absorb the Kent County contract if Safe Haven closed its doors.\n\nKent County Administrator Michael Petit de Mange said he was informed Saturday afternoon by Safe Haven Board President Rick Kirchhoff that the facility would more than likely be closing its doors in late August, therefore the county began looking for alternative dog control providers. Petit de Mange confirmed the Kent County SPCA would be on the list of options.\n\n\u201cThere are not a whole lot of options to choose from in this arena,\u201d Petit de Mange said. \u201cNot a lot of people are in this business. One option may be to try to do dog control ourselves or we can try to partner with someone else. I\u2019m certain that KSPCA is a very viable option.\u201d\n\nPetit de Mange said he\u2019d planned to meet with all of the Levy Court commissioners to gather input and ensure everyone was on the same page. Whether or not that meeting is still happening has not been confirmed.\n\nRoughly one month ago, Safe Haven officials squashed closure rumors but confirmed the shelter was experiencing financial difficulties. Since then, the shelter has been running low-cost adoption specials and several local fundraisers have been organized.\n\nKarli Swope, a part-time employee at Safe Haven for the past three years, said the organization has \u201cbeen in the hole\u201d for quite some time.\n\n\u201cThe dogs just kept coming in and not enough fundraising was being done to offset the costs,\u201d Swope said. \u201cAs the dogs kept coming in, they had to be moved to boarding houses. The boarding costs were added to the vet and supply costs and it all became too much.\u201d\n\nSwope said 75 to 80 percent of Safe Haven\u2019s dogs are pit bulls, which are difficult to adopt out due to their reputation as an aggressive breed."
