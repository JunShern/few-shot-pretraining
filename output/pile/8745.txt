In re Manuel De Jesus\n\n13   Funes Menjivar, No. A095 041 878 (B.I.A. May 29, 2015).      We\n\n14   assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and\n\n15   procedural history in this case.\n\n16       In the main, Funes challenges the IJ\u2019s reasoning for\n\n17   denying cancellation.    But he did not petition for review of\n\n18   that decision.    See Stone v. INS, 514 U.S. 386, 405 (1995)\n\n19   (requiring separate timely petitions for review of the final\n\n20   removal order and the denial of a motion to reconsider or\n\n21   reopen); Kaur v. BIA, 413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir. 2005) (per\n\n22   curiam) (same).     Funes\u2019s contentions that the IJ failed to\n\n23   consider the implications of El Salvador\u2019s temporary protective\n\n24   status or his country conditions evidence are therefore not\n\n25   before the Court.\n\n\n                                    2\n\f1           Funes also challenges the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to\n\n2    reopen.    As a general matter, we review such a decision \u201cfor\n\n3    abuse of discretion, mindful that motions to reopen \u2018are\n\n4    disfavored.\u2019\u201d         Ali v. Gonzales, 448 F.3d 515, 517 (2d Cir. 2006)\n\n5    (quoting INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314, 322-23 (1992)).                 But we\n\n6    lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s denial of cancellation\n\n7    of removal based on an alien\u2019s failure to establish \u201cexceptional\n\n8    and extremely unusual hardship,\u201d 8 U.S.C. 1229b(b)(1)(D),\n\n9    because that is a discretionary determination reserved for the\n\n10   agency,    see    8    U.S.C.     \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B);        Barco-Sandoval    v.\n\n11   Gonzales, 516 F.3d 35, 39 (2d Cir. 2008).                   We nevertheless\n\n12   retain    jurisdiction       to    review     constitutional    claims     and\n\n13   questions of law with respect to cancellation, 8 U.S.C.\n\n14   \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), which may \u201c\u2018arise for example in fact-finding\n\n15   which is flawed by an error of law\u2019 or \u2018where a discretionary\n\n16   decision is argued to be an abuse of discretion because it was\n\n17   made without rational justification or based on a legally\n\n18   erroneous standard,\u2019\u201d Barco-Sandoval, 516 F.3d at 39 (quoting\n\n19   Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 471 F.3d 315, 329 (2d\n\n20   Cir.    2006)).        To   ascertain       whether   a   petitioner   raises\n\n21   constitutional challenges or questions of law over which this\n\n22   Court has jurisdiction, we \u201cstudy the argument[] asserted\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\f1    [and] . . . determine, regardless of the rhetoric employed in\n\n2    the petition, whether it merely quarrels over the correctness\n\n3    of the factual findings or justification for the discretionary\n\n4    choices, in which case the court would lack jurisdiction.\u201d\n\n5    Xiao Ji Chen, 471 F.3d at 329.       For example, we have found an\n\n6    error of law in a hardship determination where \u201cfacts important\n\n7    to the subtle determination of \u2018exceptional and extremely\n\n8    unusual hardship\u2019 have been totally overlooked and others have\n\n9    been seriously mischaracterized.\u201d       Mendez v. Holder, 566 F.3d\n\n10   316, 323 (2d Cir. 2009).\n\n11       Here, we lack jurisdiction over the petition: Funes\u2019s\n\n12   assertion that the BIA failed to consider his daughter\u2019s speech\n\n13   condition merely employs the rhetoric of a question of law to\n\n14   challenge the agency\u2019s discretionary hardship determination.\n\n15   See Xiao Ji Chen, 471 F.3d at 329.       The BIA reviewed Funes\u2019s\n\n16   evidence and concluded that reopened proceedings would not\n\n17   reach a different outcome.   See Matter of Coelho, 20 I. & N.\n\n18   Dec. 464, 473 (B.I.A. 1992); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c).           That\n\n19   determination, in any event, was reasonable.          Some of the\n\n20   school reports predated the merits hearing and therefore were\n\n21   not new evidence.   Those that postdated the hearing did not\n\n22   reflect substantial impairment.         The BIA likewise had the\n\n\n\n                                      4\n\f1    discretion to find that the reports failed to demonstrate that\n\n2    Funes\u2019s daughter\u2019s educational needs, such as they are, will\n\n3    go unaddressed if she remains in the United States without her\n\n4    father.      Diminished    educational   opportunities    rarely\n\n5    constitute exceptional and extremely unusual hardship.    See In\n\n6    re Andazola-Rivas, 23 I. & N. Dec. 319, 323 n.1 (B.I.A. 2002)\n\n7    (\u201c[A] finding that diminished educational opportunities result\n\n8    in \u2018exceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u2019 would mean that\n\n9    cancellation of removal would be granted in virtually all cases\n\n10   involving [applicants] from developing countries who have young\n\n11   United States citizen or lawful permanent resident children[,\n\n12   which] . . . is not consistent with congressional intent.\u201d).\n\n13       For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is\n\n14   DISMISSED.   As we have completed our review, any stay of removal\n\n15   that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED,\n\n16   and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition\n\n17   is DISMISSED as moot.     Any pending request for oral argument\n\n18   in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of\n\n19   Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule\n\n20   34.1(b).\n\n21                                 FOR THE COURT:\n22                                 Catherine O=Hagan Wolfe, Clerk\n\n\n\n\n                                     5\n\f"
