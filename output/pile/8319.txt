    "text": "Tag Archives: bra\n\nJapanese lingerie company Ravijour has come up with a revolutionary albeit unusual piece of lingerie dubbed as the \u201cTrue Love Tester Bra.\u201d As its name implies, the brassiere comes with built-in sensors that monitors its wearer\u2019s heart rate and vital stats. The sensors also keep track of the secretion of a certain hormone called Catecholamine, which apparently is secreted only when a women is truly in love.\n\nData on these stats are sent via Bluetooth to a smartphone that\u2019s running the bra\u2019s companion app, which measures heart rate elevation, to determine whether it\u2019s the real deal or just a fling. When it\u2019s deemed to be the former, the app will wirelessly unhook the bra.\n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be catching much of anything with these Pokeball bras unless you\u2019re planning to wear just the bra (and nothing more) out in public. Of course, you\u2019ll be getting a lot of attention and catching the eye of many, but it\u2019ll probably be from the type of people you wouldn\u2019t want it from.\n\nThese bras are crafted by Etsy seller Neon Wonderland and are geared for the true-blue Poke-fan. It won\u2019t matter if you\u2019re gifted or not in the chest area, because you can specify the padding level you want the brassiere to have when you place your order. Each Pokeball bra is encrusted in hundreds of rhinestones that will sparkle and shine with every move that you make.\n\nLadies and gents, feast your eyes on the World\u2019s Largest Bra, which is a mega-sized 1222B! But before we talk about this ginormous piece of lingerie, let\u2019s talk about the events that made it happen.\n\nBigger isn\u2019t always better except when it has something to do with a certain part of your body\u2013and by that, I mean your heart. (Just in case you were thinking of something else, which I totally had no intention of making you do. Snicker.)\n\nIn all seriousness, having a figuratively bigger heart opens your eyes to the plights of others and the realities of the world. Cancer takes away so many precious lives every year, especially breast cancer, and the sad thing is that some of these lives could have been saved by treatment, had they made the discovery sooner. One way to do that is by getting regular check-ups. And one way to remind men and women to do that is through an awareness campaign, like the ones that the Breast Cancer Campaign is doing.\n\nSome people decided to help out the BCA this year and they did so with extremely huge efforts: by making the 97-foot long brassiere you see above (and after the jump!)\n\nThe earlier you catch it, the better your chances of treating it and living a longer life. I\u2019m talking about the Big C. Every year, over 50,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer\u2013and a number of them will end up succumbing to the disease, depending on what stage their cancer is and on their overall health.\n\nThis is why I think the Breast Tissue Screening Bra is such a wonderful project! It\u2019s a smart bra that\u2019s equipped with sensors that can measure small temperature changes as they occur. The temperature spikes could mean nothing, but they could be caused by the growth of blood vessels which signal the growth of tumors. The sensors will take note of the chronology of cell cycles and use a pattern recognition system combined with statistical analysis software to pinpoint tumors even before mammograms can detect them.\n\nOhGizmo! is a frequently updated blog that focuses on covering items that will appeal to a very specific and often very passionate audience: the geek. Aside from the fare of innovative consumer electronic products, the reader can expect to find news about geek culture, absurd inventions, awe inspiring technology, and an ever growing assortment of articles that we like to think fit within our view of what we\u2019re calling the Geek Lifestyle."
