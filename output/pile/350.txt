If the Union government feels that the number of COVID-19 cases may go up between April 30 and May 15, then the Centre should consider whether we can utilise the time we have on our hands to make arrangements for special trains to transporting the migrant workers to their native places. And the guidelines should be issued before end of April in this regard,\u201d Thackeray said during an interaction through video conference with the Central team.\n\nThe state government also withdrew the relaxed lockdown norms for Mumbai and Pune that came into effect on April 20 as the Central team raised objections to some of these, including beginning construction work on existing projects.\n\nIn Rajasthan, Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot told The Indian Express that he would consider the visit of the Central team a \u201csuccess if they solved the problem faced by states\u201d, adding that he reminded the teams that the state had \u201cdemanded a moratorium on payment of states\u2019 dues to financial institutions under the RBI and other Central agencies\u201d.\n\nBut it was in Bengal that the two Central teams, that arrived in the state on Monday, got off to a rocky start. While the north Bengal team could not move out the entire day on Tuesday, the team in Kolkata stepped out in the morning only to be told by police to make a U-turn.\n\nSources said the team was scheduled to hold a meeting with Chief Secretary Rajiva Sinha at 11 am, which was cancelled.\n\nFinally, it was only around 4.30 pm, after Sinha held a 30-minute meeting with the Central team at the BSF guesthouse at Gurusaday Road, where they have been put up, that the team members were able to visit parts of the city, including Jadavpur and part of EM Bypass, with police and BSF escorting them.\n\nOn Monday, the day the team landed, the members had visited the office of the National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases in the city and held a meeting with the Chief Secretary at Nabanna, the state secretariat.\n\nApurva Chandra, Additional Secretary, Department of Defence and leader of the five-member team in Kolkata, told ANI on Tuesday, \u201cWe met the Chief Secretary last evening at around 6 pm in Nabanna. We were assured that we will again have a meeting today and we will be taken around. But today we were informed that there are some issues and we will not be going out.\u201d\n\nMamata Banerjee had earlier written to PM Modi, saying the choice of districts for inspection and the Centre\u2019s observations about them are \u201cnothing but a figment of imagination and unfortunate\u201d. (Express photo)\n\n\u201cThe order of deployment says the state government shall provide logistic support to us. I have been in touch with the chief secretary since yesterday seeking support from the state government to visit areas. In fact, we made it very clear that we will go around only with state government liaison officers. We would like to add that teams have gone to other places like Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan and they are getting full support from the state governments and all the teams are working. They have also been given the same notice as the state government of West Bengal. But they are active and have not faced problems,\u201d Chandra said.\n\nThe team was later provided a liaison officer by the state, following which it visited 5-6 areas in Kolkata. The team, however, did not step out from the car for a physical inspection. \u201cThis was just a visual tour of how well the lockdown is being implemented in the city,\u201d said a team member, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Asked about the team\u2019s first impression of the lockdown implementation, the member said, \u201cIt seemed 90% effective.\u201d\n\nThe team did not give any feedback to the state government after the visual tour. According to sources, the team has specifically requested the Chief Secretary to arrange for a visit to COVID hospitals, quarantine centres and containment zones. \u201cNo assurances have been made on that request,\u201d the member said.\n\nIn Siliguri, the five-member Central team led by Vineet Joshi, Additional Secretary, HRD Ministry, remained stationed at the guesthouse of the Shashastra Sena Bal. Till reports last came in, they were unable to move out.\n\nDuring his evening press briefing, Chief Secretary Sinha said the administration was \u201ccooperating\u201d with the teams, but also reminded that the Central teams should have informed the state of their arrival in a \u201cproper manner\u201d.\n\nA child undergoes rapid testing for coronavirus at Belgachia, one of the red zones in Kolkata, on Monday. (Express Photo by Partha Paul)\n\n\u201c\u2026our stand is that the Centre should have contacted us first and then sent the teams. They wanted to go around Kolkata. One officer from Kolkata Police also accompanied them. We have asked them to take all precautions while visiting areas. We advised them to stay in the car and if they wanted to move about on foot, they must alert the police first. We provided them with all the information. We believe in cooperaton between the Central and state government. However, it is not wise to blame only the state. Both sides should show discipline,\u201d said Sinha.\n\nOn the team at North Bengal, Sinha said, \u201cI spoke with the team a number of times. .there is a protocol. If a Central team comes, they will have to meet the Chief Secretary. We hoped they would first meet us and then move to North Bengal. The protocol has been breached. However, we have provided all information they sought.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla\u2019s letter, asking him to comply with the MHA order, Sinha said, \u201cEveryone is busy now. We are co-operating. But we cannot leave everything and move around with the Central teams.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee hit the streets of Kolkata Tuesday afternoon, speaking into a loudspeaker and asking people not to venture out of their homes.\n\nIn Indore, Madhya Pradesh, the central team told the local administration to increase the number of beds in hospitals for COVID 19 patients, should the need arise. With 915 cases and 52 deaths from COVID-19, Indore is one of the worst affected cities in the country."
