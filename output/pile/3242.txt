What began as a start-up of three Stanford alums in 2011 quickly grew to become one of the most valuable companies in the world. It boasts 166 million daily active users who send a total average of 3 billion \u201csnaps\u201d each day. Snapchat\u2019s parent company Snap Inc., which recently went public, is valued at a whopping $30 billion and is expected to rake in $935.46 million from its app alone this year.\n\nBefore Snapchat, our communication was limited to texts and emoji. And when we did occasionally decide to send photos, it was counterintuitive and time-consuming.\n\nBefore Snapchat, our communication was limited to texts and emoji. And when we did occasionally decide to send photos, they had to be snapped separately and attached, which often was not worth the effort and the time. In that regard, Snapchat revolutionized how we share our lives and communicate with others: never before were we able to send five-second snapshots to friends and share important moments that disappear after a day in an effortless and fully customizable way.\n\nThat\u2019s why Facebook wanted to buy Snapchat almost half a decade ago now for $3 billion. Of course, Snapchat knew that its value would be worth more than $3 billion. Yet, what the Snapchat team probably did not foresee was just to what extent Facebook would go in order to copy their image messaging app.\n\nFacebook\u2019s incessant plagiarism and why it\u2019s frustrating\n\nWhen Instagram launched Stories last August (this was way after Facebook had purchased the picture-centric social media app), it quickly became the talk of the town not because it was innovative or useful, but because it resembled Snapchat\u2019s key feature just a little too much \u2013 even the name itself. Just like Snapchat Stories, Instagram Stories allows users to post pictures or short videos, doodle on them or add stickers, and upload them, which would disappear after 24 hours.\n\nFacebook did not stop there, unfortunately: not only did the \u201cStories\u201d feature expand into all of its main apps including Facebook, Messenger, and WhatsApp, but most of these apps now let users send direct photos and videos to one another, which self-terminate once opened exactly like Snapchat. Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook, responded to criticism about Facebook\u2019s blatant copying of Snapchat by saying, \u201cThe first chapter that made sense was to release products that people were familiar with\u2026 I feel like we do different kinds of work in different areas (compared to Snapchat).\u201d\n\nFor a company who takes pride in practically coining the term \u201csocial media,\u201d simply brushing off what may be a byproduct of a lack of innovation as a necessary step seems almost hypocritical.\n\nAlthough Zuckerberg has reassured the public that the continued plagiarism is only a small part of the company\u2019s bigger AR plans, it\u2019s still incredibly frustrating for me for several reasons. First is Facebook\u2019s attitude: for a company who takes pride in practically coining the term \u201csocial media,\u201d simply brushing off what may be a byproduct of a lack of innovation as a necessary step seems almost hypocritical. Not only that, the stolen Snapchat features on Facebook\u2019s apps don\u2019t work as well as the original. For instance, I\u2019ve noticed that on my phone, Facebook now gives you two bubbles: one for your usual chats and one for Facebook\u2019s My Day. I haven\u2019t figured out how to get rid of the second bubble, and whenever I open my chat bubble, I\u2019m stuck with notifications for life stories of people that I don\u2019t even care about.\n\nSnapchat was always a more private place for me with significantly fewer contacts than Facebook. Facebook\u2019s take on Snapchat Stories is intrusive, unoriginal, and frustratingly useless.\n\nStick to the status quo, Skype\n\nWell, the true tragedy is that Facebook is not the only company: Tinder is reportedly looking into a Snapchat-like style UI for sharing multimedia, and Viber has already added Snapchat-like features to its app with the latest update. And now, Skype is the latest messaging app to join in on the shameless aping of Snapchat. The Microsoft-owned video-chatting app now has a tab called \u201cCapture,\u201d where you can take photos and short videos to send to your contacts. And yes, you guessed right \u2013 you can insert text, doodle on them, put stickers on them, and even add them to your \u201chighlights\u201d (aka Stories). The entire UI, just like Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp, is eerily identical to Snapchat\u2019s, and you have to wonder, \u201cWhere do we draw the line between providing a familiar experience for end-users and creating a desperate clone?\u201d\n\nSkype is for video chats; it\u2019s not where best friends send double-chinned photos or where millennials share their music festival shenanigans. From a company\u2019s perspective, the addition of Snapchat-like features could mean attracting more users. However, from a user\u2019s perspective, the indistinguishable mishmash of Snapchat-wannabe apps means their original, distinctive purposes are slowly becoming lost.\n\nThe indistinguishable mishmash of Snapchat-wannabe apps means their original, distinctive purposes are slowly becoming lost.\n\nWhat\u2019s next? Is Microsoft going to introduce GroupMe Stories? Will we soon be able to send ten-second videos on Telegram? With the latest update to Skype, perhaps it\u2019s time to say enough is enough.\n\nIs all the senseless copying hurting Snapchat?\n\nProbably the more interesting question here is whether these stolen Snapchat features on other apps have hurt Snapchat itself, and it looks like the answer could be yes. As I previously discussed, the number of downloads for Snapchat dropped dramatically in August 2016, right around when Instagram Stories first launched. The number stayed relatively low until the beginning of November 2016 when it introduced World Lenses.\n\nAlthough Facebook\u2019s other apps haven\u2019t yet enjoyed the boom that Instagram has, the likelihood is that Snapchat users will continue to migrate to Instagram as those two apps probably have the largest shared audience.\n\nWhat Snapchat must confront, however, is the challenge of attracting a broader audience.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean we will see Snapchat\u2019s demise any time soon. Its more intimate and private nature as well as the vast celebrity users will continue to attract more users. What Snapchat must confront, however, is the challenge of attracting a broader audience. Facebook and its apps already have an eclectic range of users, from millennials to 90-something year-olds; Snapchat, on the other hand, seems exclusively focused on a certain age group and a certain socioeconomic sector. In an age where major companies are out to bury Snapchat by baking its features right into their own messaging apps, Snapchat will certainly have a harder time surviving by merely existing.\n\nHave you used the new Skype app?
