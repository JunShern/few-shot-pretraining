    "text": "Earlier Thursday, Syrian President Bashar Assad announced publicly that his country had formally applied to join the chemical weapons treaty. According to the treaty\u2019s terms, Syria would be required to submit a declaration detailing the types, quantities, and locations of all its chemical weapons and the locations of all facilities for producing them within 60 days of formally joining the accord.\n\nBut Kerry said that the normal procedures were far too slow because Assad\u2019s government had used chemical weapons against its own people.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing standard about this process because of the way the regime has behaved,\u201d Kerry said. \u201cThe words of the Syrian regime in our judgment are simply not enough.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for Samantha Power, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, made a similar point in a statement.\n\n\u201cSyria needs to take immediate actions to disclose, surrender, and eliminate its chemical weapons stockpile under international monitoring and verification,\u201d the spokeswoman, Erin Pelton, said. \u201cStatements without action are wholly insufficient for a country that has had a secret, enormous chemical weapons program for decades.\u201d\n\nKerry and Lavrov stood side by side in a public show of joint purpose. But differences quickly reemerged, as Lavrov stressed that the \u201csolution of this problem will remove any need for a strike.\u201d\n\nKerry said that \u201conly the credible threat of force\u201d had prompted Assad to acknowledge that his nation possessed chemical weapons in the first place, and that a military option was needed to ensure that Assad fulfilled his promises.\n\nAt the end of their presentations, Lavrov seemed surprised by the length and tone of Kerry\u2019s statement.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not prepared with the extended political statement,\u201d Lavrov said. \u201cDiplomacy likes silence.\u201d\n\nAt the end of their appearance, Kerry said that he had not heard some of Lavrov\u2019s remarks, and asked that the interpreter repeat them.\n\nTurning to Kerry, Lavrov joked in English that that was not necessary.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou want me to take your word for it?\u201d Kerry said with a smile. \u201cIt is a little early for that.\u201d\n\nThe two men then left to meet together along with their teams of arms control experts. The American and Russian officials were to meet again Friday and probably Saturday.\n\nKerry and Lavrov met at the same Geneva hotel where Hillary Rodham Clinton, then the secretary of state, presented Lavrov with a red \u201creset\u201d button in 2009 to symbolize the efforts of the administration of President Obama to improve ties with Moscow. It was an effort that has been largely stymied since Vladimir Putin resumed his role as Russia\u2019s president.\n\nAmerican officials say they hope Kerry and Lavrov can work out an effective plan, but they are wary of the United States being drawn into prolonged talks that would serve as a tactic to delay, and perhaps prevent, an American-led military strike. One test will be the willingness of Russia and Syria to accept a rapid beginning to international control that would preclude the Assad government from gaining access to chemical weapons or using them, a senior State Department official said.\n\nComing up with a verifiable plan to inspect, control, and dispose of Syria\u2019s chemical weapons during a civil war is a daunting task. Though Obama administration officials have said the problem of Syria\u2019s chemical weapons has been discussed with the Russians for more than a year, the sides have not talked about it in detail.\n\nFor example, the United States and Russia have yet to compare intelligence on the quantities of Syria\u2019s chemical stocks, their main elements, and their locations. American officials have declassified intelligence reports and plan to begin that process here.\n\n\u201cWhat we will be looking at is the chemical weapons stockpiles, the production facilities, precursor chemicals,\u201d the State Department official said. \u201cAnd to the extent that there are munitions that are used to spread those chemical weapons in whatever manner, that obviously is part of dismantling and destroying the chemical weapons that Assad has.\u201d\n\nA major concern is how to conduct inspections safely in the middle of a civil war.\n\nGary Samore, the senior aide on nonproliferation issues at the National Security Council during Obama\u2019s first term, said that the Assad government would be reluctant to give up its entire arsenal because it valued poison gas as a deterrent against Israel and as a weapon to use against Syrian rebels.\n\n\u201cWhat Assad might make is a partial declaration of the chemical weapons he is willing to put under international control and keep a significant portion in his back pocket,\u201d said Samore, the director of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard.\n\nBut Obama\u2019s decision to delay any military action and explore a disarmament plan with the Russians, who have been a main supplier of arms to the Assad government, has distressed much of the Syrian opposition and raised questions about whether the rebels would even take part in such a peace conference.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re upset,\u201d a senior State Department official said. \u201cThey don\u2019t trust this at all.\u201d\n\nIn a recent statement, General Salim Idris, the head of the military wing of the Syrian opposition, rejected the Russian initiative and said the Syrians who carried out the Aug. 21 chemical attack near Damascus that started the current crisis must be punished.\n\nIn an effort to address the opposition\u2019s fears, Kerry spoke Thursday with Idris and Ahmad al-Jarba, the president of the Syrian opposition, and sought to assure them that the military option remained on the table, and that the Obama administration would insist that any understanding about Syria\u2019s chemical weapons be verifiable and enforceable, a State Department official said.\n\nBostonGlobe.com complimentary digital access has been provided to you, without a subscription, for free starting today and ending in 14 days.
