Please help me! \n\nA:\n\nHint: Rolle's theortem\nIf a real-valued function $f$ is continuous on a proper closed interval $[a, b]$, differentiable on the open interval (a, b), and $f(a) = f(b)(=0)$, then there exists at least one c in the open interval $(a, b)$ such that\n$f'(c) = 0$.\nNow, what about a polynomial and two consequtive roots of it? (The first three statements can be falsified by simple examples.)\n\n"
