The problem was that I tried adding an image to it, but it showed up as a black box.  \nHere is the code from the CustomView \n@implementation Keys\n\n- (id)initWithFrame:(CGRect)frame\n{\nself = [super initWithFrame:frame];\nif (self) {\n\n    self.backgroundColor = [UIColor colorWithPatternImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@\"whitekey.gif\"]];                                \n\n}\nreturn self;\n\n(I've confirmed that the problem isn't whitekey.gif)\nHere is the code from the viewController\n- (void)viewDidLoad\n{\n[super viewDidLoad];\n\nKeys *whiteKey = [[Keys alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, 100, 300)];\n[self.view addSubview:whiteKey];\n\n}\n\nIs it better if I subclass UIImageView? \n\nA:\n\nYou should be using UIImageView.\n\nAn image view object provides a view-based container for displaying\n  either a single image or for animating a series of images.\n\nhttp://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/uikit/reference/UIImageView_Class/Reference/Reference.html\nMaybe a UIView as a container, with a UIImageView with the piano key image, with additional UIViews on top of that, depending on what you need to do?\n\n"
