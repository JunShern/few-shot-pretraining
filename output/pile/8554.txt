We say that a tile $T$ *tiles* $\\mathbb{Z}^d$ if $\\mathbb{Z}^d$ can be partitioned into copies of $T$, that is, subsets that are translations, rotations or reflections, or any combination of these, of $T$.\n\nFor example, the tile $\\texttt{X.X} = \\{-1,1\\} \\subset \\mathbb{Z}$ tiles $\\mathbb{Z}$. The tile $\\texttt{XX.XX} = \\{-2,-1,1,2\\} \\subset \\mathbb{Z}$ does not tile $\\mathbb{Z}$, but we can also regard it as a tile in $\\mathbb{Z}^2$, and indeed it tiles $\\mathbb{Z}^2$, as shown, for example, in [@gltan16].\n\nChalcraft [@chalcraft1; @chalcraft2] conjectured that, for any tile $T \\subset \\mathbb{Z}^n$, there is some dimension $d$ for which $T$ tiles $\\mathbb{Z}^d$. This was proved by Gruslys, Leader and Tan [@gltan16]. The first non-trivial case is the *punctured interval* $T = \\underbrace{\\texttt{XXXXX}}_{k}\\!\\texttt{.}\\!\\underbrace{\\texttt{XXXXX}}_{k}$. The authors of [@gltan16] showed that $T$ tiles $\\mathbb{Z}^d$ for $d = 2k^2$, but they were unable to prove that the smallest required dimension $d$ was quadratic in $k$, or even that $d \\to \\infty$ as $k \\to \\infty$. They therefore asked the following question:\n\nLet $T$ be the punctured interval $\\underbrace{\\texttt{\\emph{XXXXX}}}_{k}\\!\\texttt{.}\\!\\underbrace{\\texttt{\\emph{XXXXX}}}_{k}$, and let $d$ be the least number such that $T$ tiles $\\mathbb{Z}^d$. Does $d \\to \\infty$ as $k \\to \\infty$?\n\nIn this paper we will show that, rather unexpectedly, $d$ does not tend to $\\infty$:\n\n\\[mainthm\\] Let $T$ be the punctured interval $\\underbrace{\\texttt{\\emph{XXXXX}}}_{k}\\!\\texttt{.}\\!\\underbrace{\\texttt{\\emph{XXXXX}}}_{k}$. Then $T$ tiles $\\mathbb{Z}^4$. Furthermore, if $k$ is odd or congruent to $4 \\pmod 8$, then $T$ tiles $\\mathbb{Z}^3$.\n\nWe have already noted that `X.X` tiles $\\mathbb{Z}$, and `XX.XX` tiles $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ but not $\\mathbb{Z}$. It can be shown via case analysis that, for $k \\geq 3$, the tile $T$ does not tile $\\mathbb{Z}^2$. However, this proof is tedious and provides little insight, and since it is not the focus of this paper, we omit it. For odd $k \\geq 3$ and for $k \\equiv 4 \\pmod 8$, 3 is therefore the least $d$ such that $T$ tiles $\\mathbb{Z}^d$. For the remaining cases, namely $k \\equiv 0, 2, 6 \\pmod 8$, $k \\geq 6$, it is unknown whether the least possible $d$ is 3 or 4.\n\nIn this paper, we will first prove the result for odd $k$. This will introduce some key ideas, which we will develop to prove the result for general $k$, and then to improve the dimension from 4 to 3 for $k \\equiv 4 \\pmod 8$.\n\nFinally, we give some background. Tilings of $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ by polyominoes (edge-connected tiles in $\\mathbb{Z}^2$) have been thoroughly investigated. For example, Golomb [@golomb70] showed that results of Berger [@berger66] implied that there is no algorithm which decides whether copies of a given finite set of polyominoes tile $\\mathbb{Z}^2$. It is unknown whether the same is true for tilings by a single polyomino. For tilings of $\\mathbb{Z}$ by sets of general one-dimensional tiles, such an algorithm does exist, as demonstrated by Adler and Holroyd [@ah81]. Kisisel [@kisisel01] introduced an ingenious technique for proving that certain tiles do not tile $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ without having to resort to case analysis.\n\nA similar problem is to consider whether a tile $T$ tiles certain finite regions, such as cuboids. There is a significant body of research, sometimes involving computer searches, on tilings of rectangles in $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ by polyominoes (see, for example, Conway and Lagarias [@cl90] and Dahlke [@dahlke]). Friedman [@friedman] has collected some results on tilings of rectangles by small one-dimensional tiles. More recently, Gruslys, Leader and Tomon [@gltomon16] and Tomon [@tomon16] considered the related problem of partitioning the Boolean lattice into copies of a poset, and similarly Gruslys [@gruslys16] and Gruslys and Letzter [@gl16] have worked on the problem of partitioning the hypercube into copies of a graph.\n\nPreliminaries and the odd case\n==============================\n\nWe begin with the case of $k$ odd. This is technically much simpler than the general case, and allows us to demonstrate some of the main ideas in the proof of Theorem \\[mainthm\\] in a less complicated setting.\n\n\\[kodd\\] Let $T$ be the punctured interval $\\underbrace{\\texttt{\\emph{XXXXX}}}_{k}\\!\\texttt{.}\\!\\underbrace{\\texttt{\\emph{XXXXX}}}_{k}$, with $k$ odd. Then $T$ tiles $\\mathbb{Z}^3$.\n\nThroughout this section, $T$ is fixed, and $k \\geq 3$. We will not yet assume that $k$ is odd, because the tools that we are about to develop will be relevant to the general case too.\n\nWe start with an important definition from [@gltan16]: a *string* is a one-dimensional infinite line in $\\mathbb{Z}^d$ with every $(k+1)$th point removed. Crucially, a string is a disjoint union of copies of $T$.\n\nWe cannot tile $\\mathbb{Z}^d$ with strings, as each string intersects $[k+1]^d$ in either 0 or $k$ points, and $(k+1)^d$ is not divisible by $k$. However, we could try to tile $\\mathbb{Z}^d$ by using strings in $d-1$ of the $d$ possible directions, leaving holes that can be filled with copies of $T$ in the final direction. We therefore consider $\\mathbb{Z}^d$ as consisting of slices equivalent to $\\mathbb{Z}^{d-1}$, each of which will be partially tiled by strings.\n\nAny partial tiling of the discrete torus $\\mathbb{Z}_{k+1}^{d-1} = (\\mathbb{Z}/(k+1)\\mathbb{Z})^{d-1}$ by lines with one point removed corresponds to a partial tiling of $\\mathbb{Z}^{d-1}$ by strings. We will restrict our attention to these tilings at first, as they are easy to work with.\n\nWe will call a set $X \\subset \\mathbb{Z}_{k+1}^{d-1}$ a *hole* in $\\mathbb{Z}_{k+1}^{d-1}$ if $\\mathbb{Z}_{k+1}^{d-1} \\setminus X$ can be tiled with strings. One particularly useful case of this is when $d = 3$ and $X$ either has exactly one point in each row of $\\mathbb{Z}_{k+1}^2$ or exactly one point in each column of $\\mathbb{Z}_{k+1}^2$. Then $X$ is clearly a hole, since a string in $\\mathbb{Z}_{k+1}^2$ is just a row or column minus a point.\n\nThe following result will allow us to fill the gaps in the final direction, assuming we have chosen the partial tilings of the $\\mathbb{Z}^{d-1}$ slices carefully:\n\n\\[biglemma\\] Let $S \\subset \\mathbb{Z}^d$, $|S| = 3$. Then there exists $Y \\subset S \\times \\mathbb{Z}$ such that $T$ tiles $Y$, and for every $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, $|Y \\cap (S \\times \\{n\\})| = 2$.\n\nLet $S = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3\\}$. For $i = 1,2,3$, place a copy of $T$ beginning at $\\{x_i\\} \\times \\{n\\}$ for every $n \\equiv ik \\pmod {3k}$. The union $Y$ of these tiles has the required property:\\\nFor $n \\equiv 0, k+1, \\ldots, 2k-1 \\pmod{3k}$, $Y \\cap (S \\times \\{n\\}) = \\{x_1, x_3\\} \\times \\{n\\}$.\\\nFor $n \\equiv k, 2k+1, \\ldots, 3k-1 \\pmod{3k}$, $Y \\cap (S \\times \\{n\\}) = \\{x_1, x_2\\} \\times \\{n\\}$.\\\nFor $n \\equiv 2k, 1, \\ldots, k-1 \\pmod{3k}$, $Y \\cap (S \\times \\{n\\}) = \\{x_2, x_3\\} \\times \\{n\\}$.\\\n\nWe will now prove Theorem \\[kodd\\]. We know that if $X \\subset \\mathbb{Z}_{k+1}^2$ has one point in each row or column then $X$ is a hole of size $k+1$. Since $k+1$ is even, we can try to choose $X_n$ in each slice $\\mathbb{Z}_{k+1}^2 \\times \\{n\\}$ so that $\\bigcup_{n\\in\\mathbb{Z}}X_n$ is the disjoint union of $\\frac{k+1}{2}$ sets $Y_i$ of the form in Lemma \\[biglemma\\].\n\nWe can do this as follows:\\\nFor $n \\equiv 0, k+1, \\ldots, 2k-1 \\pmod{3k}$, let $X_n = \\{(0,0),(1,1),\\ldots,(k-1,k-1),(k,k)\\}$.\\\nFor $n \\equiv k, 2k+1, \\ldots, 3k-1 \\pmod{3k}$, let $X_n = \\{(0,0),(0,1),(2,2),(2,3),\\ldots,(k-1,k-1),\\newline(k-1,k)\\}$.\\\nFor $n \\equiv 2k, 1, \\ldots, k-1 \\pmod{3k}$, let $X_n = \\{(0,1),(1,1),(2,3),(3,3),\\ldots,(k-1,k),(k,k)\\}$.\\\nThen let $X = \\bigcup\\limits_{n\\in\\mathbb{Z}} (X_n \\times \\{n\\}) \\subset \\mathbb{Z}_{k+1}^2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nEach $X_n$ is a hole, so we can tile $(\\mathbb{Z}_{k+1}^2 \\times \\mathbb{Z})\\setminus X$ with strings. Also, $X$ is the disjoint union of sets of the form $Y$ from Lemma \\[biglemma\\]: for $0 \\leq i \\leq \\frac{k-1}{2}$, let $S_i = \\{(2i,2i),(2i,2i+1),(2i+1,2i+1)\\}$. Then $X \\cap (S_i \\times \\mathbb{Z})$ is precisely the set $Y$ generated from $S_i$ in the proof of Lemma \\[biglemma\\]. Hence $T$ tiles $X$.\n\nSince $(\\mathbb{Z}_{k+1}^2 \\times \\mathbb{Z})\\setminus X$ can be tiled with strings, we can partially tile $\\mathbb{Z}^3$ with strings, leaving a copy of $X$ empty in each copy of $\\mathbb{Z}_{k+1}^2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}$. We can tile all of these copies of $X$ with $T$, so $T$ tiles $\\mathbb{Z}^3$, completing the proof of Theorem \\[kodd\\].\n\nThe general case\n================\n\nWe now move on to general $k$:\n\n\\[generalk\\] Let $T$ be the tile $\\underbrace{\\texttt{\\emph{XXXXX}}}_{k}\\!\\texttt{.}\\!\\underbrace{\\texttt{\\emph{XXXXX}}}_{k}$. Then $T$ tiles $\\mathbb{Z}^4$.\n\nWe will assume throughout that $T$ is fixed and $k \\geq 3$.\n\nFor even $k$, the construction used to prove Theorem \\[kodd\\] does not work, as all holes in $\\mathbb{Z}_{k+1}^2$ have size $(k+1)^2-mk$ for some $m$, and this is always odd, so we cannot use Lemma \\[biglemma\\]. The same is true if we replace 2 with a larger dimension, or if, as in [@gltan16], we use strings in which every $(2k+1)$th point, rather than every $(k+1)$th point, is removed. We will therefore need a new idea.\n\nInstead of using strings in $d-1$ out of $d$ directions, we could only use them in $d-2$ directions and fill the gaps with copies of $T$ in the 2 remaining directions. We will show that this approach works in the case $d = 2$, giving a tiling of $\\mathbb{Z}^4$. The strategy will be to produce a partial tiling of each $\\mathbb{Z}^3$ slice and use the construction from Lemma \\[biglemma\\] to fill the gaps with tiles in the fourth direction.\n\nWe will again build partial tilings of $\\mathbb{Z}^{2}$, and therefore of higher dimensions, from partial tilings of the discrete torus $\\mathbb{Z}_{k+1}^{2}$. The following result is a special case of one proved in [@gltan16]:\n\n\\[onepoint\\] If $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{k+1}^{2}$, then $\\mathbb{Z}_{k+1}^{2}\\setminus\\{x\\}$ can be tiled with strings.\n\nLet $x = (x_1,x_2)$, where the first coordinate is horizontal and the second vertical. Since a string is a row or column minus one point, we can place a string $(\\{n\\} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{k+1})\\setminus\\{(n,x_2)\\}$ in each column, leaving only the row $\\mathbb{Z}_{k+1} \\times \\{x_2\\}$ empty. Placing the string $(\\mathbb{Z}_{k+1} \\times \\{x_2\\})\\setminus \\{x\\}$ in this row completes the tiling of $\\mathbb{Z}_{k+1}^{2}\\setminus\\{x\\}$.\n\nThe sets $S$ of size 3 that we will use in Lemma \\[biglemma\\] will have 2 points, say $x_1$ and $x_2$, in one $\\mathbb{Z}_{k+1}^{2}$ layer and one point, say $x_3$, in another layer. Every layer will contain points from exactly one such set $S$. Let $Y$ be the set constructed from $S$ in the proof of Lemma \\[biglemma\\]. In a given slice $\\mathbb{Z}^3 \\times \\{n\\}$, there are therefore two cases:\n\n1.  $Y \\cap (S \\times \\{n\\}) = \\{x_1, x_3\\} \\times \\{n\\}$ or $\\{x_2, x_3\\} \\times \\{n\\}$.\n\n2.  $Y \\cap (S \\times \\{n\\}) = \\{x_1, x_2\\} \\times \\{n\\}$.\n\nIn Case 1, each $\\mathbb{Z}_{k+1}^{2}$ layer contains exactly one point of $Y$. $T$ then tiles the rest of the layer by Proposition \\[onepoint\\].\n\nIn Case 2, some of the layers contain two points of $Y$, and some of the layers contain no points. Holes of size 0 and 2 do not exist, so we will need copies of $T$ in the third direction to fill some gaps (where $Y$ consists of copies of $T$ in the fourth direction). The following lemma provides us with a way to do this:\n\n\\[otherlemma\\] Let $A \\subset \\mathbb{Z}^d$, $|S| = 3k$. Then there exists $B \\subset S \\times \\mathbb{Z}$ such that $T$ tiles $B$, and $$|B \\cap (S \\times \\{n\\})| = \n    \\begin{cases}\n    k+1 & \\text{\\emph{if} } n \\equiv 1, \\ldots, k \\pmod{2k}\\\\\n    k-1 & \\text{\\emph{if} } n \\equiv k+1, \\ldots, 2k \\pmod{2k}\n    \\end{cases}$$\n\nLet $A = \\{a_1, \\ldots, a_{3k}\\}$. Then:\\\nFor $i = 1, \\ldots, k$, place a copy of $T$ beginning at $\\{a_i\\} \\times \\{n\\}$ for every $n \\equiv i \\pmod{6k}$.\\\nFor $i = k+1, \\ldots, 2k$, place a copy of $T$ beginning at $\\{a_i\\} \\times \\{n\\}$ for every $n \\equiv i+k \\pmod{6k}$.\\\nFor $i = 2k+1, \\ldots, 3k$, place a copy of $T$ beginning at $\\{a_i\\} \\times \\{n\\}$ for every $n \\equiv i+2k \\pmod{6k}$.\\\nWe now observe that the union $B$ of these tiles has the required property.\\\nFor $n \\equiv 1, \\ldots, k \\pmod{6k}$, $B \\cap (A \\times \\{n\\}) = \\{a_{2k+n}, \\ldots, a_{3k}, a_1, \\ldots, a_n\\}$ (size $k+1$).\\\nFor $n \\equiv k+1, \\ldots, 2k \\pmod{6k}$, $B \\cap (A \\times \\{n\\}) = \\{a_1, \\ldots, a_k\\}\\setminus\\{a_{n-k}\\}$ (size $k-1$).\\\nFor $n \\equiv 2k+1, \\ldots, 3k \\pmod{6k}$, $B \\cap (A \\times \\{n\\}) = \\{a_{n-2k}, \\ldots, a_{n-k}\\}$ (size $k+1$).\\\nFor $n \\equiv 3k+1, \\ldots, 4k \\pmod{6k}$, $B \\cap (A \\times \\{n\\}) = \\{a_{k+1}, \\ldots, a_{2k}\\}\\setminus\\{a_{n-2k}\\}$ (size $k-1$).\\\nFor $n \\equiv 4k+1, \\ldots, 5k \\pmod{6k}$, $B \\cap (A \\times \\{n\\}) = \\{a_{n-3k}, \\ldots, a_{n-2k}\\}$ (size $k+1$).\\\nFor $n \\equiv 5k+1, \\ldots, 6k \\pmod{6k}$, $B \\cap (A \\times \\{n\\}) = \\{a_{2k+1}, \\ldots, a_{3k}\\}\\setminus\\{a_{n-3k}\\}$ (size $k-1$).\n\nThe reasoning behind this lemma is that there exist sets $X \\subset \\mathbb{Z}_{k+1}^{2} \\times \\mathbb{Z}$ that are missing exactly $k+1$ points in every $\\mathbb{Z}_{k+1}^{2}$ layer and can be tiled with strings. If we take $d = 2$ in Lemma \\[otherlemma\\], we would like to choose such a set $X$ and a set $A \\subset \\mathbb{Z}_{k+1}^{2}$ (abusing notation slightly, as $\\mathbb{Z}_{k+1}^{2}$ is not actually a subset of $\\mathbb{Z}^2$) such that the resulting $B$ in Lemma \\[otherlemma\\] is disjoint from $X$. Then $(\\mathbb{Z}_{k+1}^{2} \\times \\mathbb{Z})\\setminus(B \\cup X)$ contains either 2 or 0 points in each $\\mathbb{Z}_{k+1}^{2}$ layer, which is what we wanted.\n\nIn order for this construction to work, we need the set $B \\cap (A \\times \\{n\\})$ to be a hole whenever it has size $k+1$, and to be a subset of a hole of size $k+1$ whenever it has size $k-1$, so that we actually can tile the required points with strings. By observing the forms of the sets $B \\cap (A \\times \\{n\\})$ in the proof of Lemma \\[otherlemma\\], we see that it is sufficient to choose the $a_n$ such that for all $n$, $\\{a_n, \\ldots, a_{n+k}\\}$ is a hole. Here we regard the indices $n$ of the points $a_n$ of $A$ as integers mod $3k$, so $a_{3k+1} = a_1$ and so on. The following proposition says that we can do this.\n\n\\[anprop\\] There exists a set $A = \\{a_1, \\ldots, a_{3k}\\} \\subset \\mathbb{Z}_{k+1}^{2}$ such that for all $n$, $\\{a_n, \\ldots, a_{n+k}\\}$ contains either one point in every row or one point in every column. Here the indices are regarded as integers *mod* $3k$.\n\nFor $n = 1, \\ldots, k+1$, let $a_n = (n-1,n-1)$.\\\nFor $n = k+2, \\ldots, 2k-1$, let $a_n = (n-k-2,n-k-1)$.\\\nFor $n = 2k, 2k+1, 2k+2$, let $a_n = (n-k-2,n-2k)$.\\\nFor $n = 2k+3, \\ldots, 3k$, let $a_n = (n-2k-3,n-2k)$.\\\nNote that all the $a_n$ are distinct. Let us regard the first coordinate as horizontal and the second as vertical.\\\nThen, for $n = 1, \\ldots, 2k$, $\\{a_n, \\ldots, a_{n+k}\\}$ contains one point in every column.\\\nFor $n = 2k+1, \\ldots, 3k$, $\\{a_n, \\ldots, a_{n+k}\\}$ contains one point in every row.\n\nFrom now on, $a_n$ refers to the points defined in the above proof. This proposition is the motivation for choosing the value $6k$ in the proof of Lemma \\[otherlemma\\].\n\nWe can now prove Theorem \\[generalk\\]. We will need 3 distinct partial tilings of $\\mathbb{Z}^3$ slices, corresponding to the 3 cases in the proof of Lemma \\[biglemma\\] with $d = 3$. The repeating unit in each of these partial tilings will have size $(k+1) \\times (k+1) \\times 6k$, so we will work in $\\mathbb{Z}_{k+1}^2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{6k}$.\n\nWe start by choosing the sets $S$ as in Lemma \\[biglemma\\]. These will be as follows:\\\nFor $n = 1, \\ldots, k$, $S_n = \\{(0,0,n),(a_n,n+k),(a_{k+1},n+k)\\}$.\\\nFor $n = k+1, \\ldots, 2k$, $S_n = \\{(0,0,n+k),(a_n,n+2k),(a_{2k+1},n+2k)\\}$.\\\nFor $n = 2k+1, \\ldots, 3k$, $S_n = \\{(0,0,n+2k),(a_n,n+3k),(a_1,n+3k)\\}$.\\\nWe will refer to the points in $S_n$ as $x_{n,1},x_{n,2},x_{n,3}$ in the order given.\n\nWe can construct a set $Y_n \\subset \\mathbb{Z}^4$ from each $S_n$ using the construction in the proof of Lemma \\[biglemma\\]. Let $Y = \\bigcup_{1 \\leq n \\leq 3k} Y_n$. For a given $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, there are two possibilities for the structure of $Y \\cap (\\mathbb{Z}_{k+1}^2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{6k} \\times \\{m\\})$:\n\n1.  $Y \\cap (\\mathbb{Z}_{k+1}^2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{6k} \\times \\{m\\})$ consists of pairs of the form $\\{x_{n,1},x_{n,2}\\}$ or $\\{x_{n,1},x_{n,3}\\}$. Then it contains exactly one point in each $\\mathbb{Z}_{k+1}^2$ layer. We can therefore tile $(\\mathbb{Z}_{k+1}^2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{6k} \\times \\{m\\}) \\setminus Y$ entirely with strings, by Proposition \\[onepoint\\].\n\n2.  $Y \\cap (\\mathbb{Z}_{k+1}^2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{6k} \\times \\{m\\})$ consists of pairs of the form $\\{x_{n,2},x_{n,3}\\}$. Then it contains either 2 or 0 points in each $\\mathbb{Z}_{k+1}^2$ layer.\\\n    If $A = \\{a_1, \\ldots, a_{3k}\\}$, and $B$ is the set constructed from $A$ in the proof of Lemma \\[otherlemma\\], then, by the choice of the $S_n$, the sets $B$ and $Y \\cap (\\mathbb{Z}_{k+1}^2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{6k} \\times \\{m\\})$ are disjoint. Furthermore, if $C$ is the union of these two sets, then, for every $n$, $C \\cap (\\mathbb{Z}_{k+1}^2 \\times \\{n\\} \\times \\{m\\}) = \\{a_r, \\ldots, a_{r+k}\\}$ for some $r$, and by Proposition \\[anprop\\], this contains either one point in every row or one point in every column and is therefore a hole.\\\n    Since $T$ tiles $B$, it also tiles $(\\mathbb{Z}_{k+1}^2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{6k} \\times \\{m\\}) \\setminus Y$.\n\n$T$ tiles $Y$ by Lemma \\[biglemma\\]. Hence $T$ tiles $\\mathbb{Z}_{k+1}^2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{6k} \\times \\mathbb{Z}$, and therefore also $\\mathbb{Z}^4$, completing the proof of Theorem \\[generalk\\].\n\nThe 4 mod 8 case\n================\n\nTo finish the proof of Theorem \\[mainthm\\], all that remains is to prove the following:\n\n\\[4mod8\\] Let $T$ be the tile $\\underbrace{\\texttt{\\emph{XXXXX}}}_{k}\\!\\texttt{.}\\!\\underbrace{\\texttt{\\emph{XXXXX}}}_{k}$, with $k \\equiv 4 \\pmod 8$. Then $T$ tiles $\\mathbb{Z}^3$.\n\nWe will prove this by constructing partial tilings of each $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ slice and filling in the gaps using the construction from the proof of Lemma \\[biglemma\\]. We will define 3 subsets $X_1$, $X_2$, $X_3$ of $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ and show that $T$ tiles each of them. However, two of these tilings will not make use of strings.\n\nLet $S_1 = \\{(x,x+n(k+1)) \\; | \\; n \\in \\mathbb{Z}, x \\equiv 2n,2n+1,2n+2,2n+3 \\pmod 8\\}$.\n\nLet $S_2 = \\{(x,x+n(k+1)) \\; | \\; n\\in \\mathbb{Z}, x \\equiv 2n+4,2n+5,2n+6,2n+7 \\pmod 8\\}$.\n\nLet $S_3 = \\{(x,x+n(k+1)+1) \\; | \\; n \\in \\mathbb{Z}, x \\equiv 2n+2,2n+3,2n+4,2n+5 \\pmod 8\\}$.\n\nLet $X_1 = \\mathbb{Z}^2 \\setminus (S_2 \\cup S_3)$, $X_2 = \\mathbb{Z}^2 \\setminus (S_1 \\cup S_3)$, $X_3 = \\mathbb{Z}^2 \\setminus (S_1 \\cup S_2)$.\n\nLet the first coordinate be horizontal and the second vertical.\n\n$X_3$ is $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ with every $(k+1)$th diagonal removed, so each row (or column) is $Z$ with every $(k+1)$th point removed, that is, a string. Hence $T$ tiles $X_3$.\n\nWe will show that $X_1$ can be tiled with vertical copies of $T$ and $X_2$ can be tiled with horizontal copies of $T$.\n\nNote that $(x,x+n(k+1))+(2,k+3) = (x+2,(x+2)+(n+1)(k+1))$. Also, if $x \\equiv 2n+r \\pmod 8$, then $x+2 \\equiv 2(n+1)+r \\pmod 8$. Hence, by the definitions of $S_2$ and $S_3$, we see that $X_1$ is invariant under translation by $(2,k+3)$. To show that vertical copies of $T$ tile $X_1$, it therefore suffices to show that $T$ tiles the columns $X_1 \\cap (\\{0\\} \\times \\mathbb{Z})$ and $X_1 \\cap (\\{1\\} \\times \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nBut in fact, if $(0,y) \\in S_2$, then $0 \\equiv 2n+4$ or $2n+6 \\pmod 8$, so $1 \\equiv 2n+5$ or $2n+7 \\pmod 8$, so also $(1,y+1) \\in S_2$. The converse also holds, and the same is true for $S_3$. Thus we only need to check the case $x = 0$.\n\n$(0,n(k+1)) \\in S_2$ for $n \\equiv 1,2,5,6 \\pmod 8$, that is, $n \\equiv 1,2 \\pmod 4$.\n\n$(0,n(k+1)+1) \\in S_3$ for $n \\equiv 2,3,6,7 \\pmod 8$, that is, $n \\equiv 2,3 \\pmod 4$.\n\nTherefore $(0,y) \\notin X_1$ for $y \\equiv k+1, 2(k+1), 2(k+1)+1, 3(k+1)+1 \\pmod{4(k+1)}$, so copies of $T$ beginning at positions $1$ and $2(k+1)+2 \\pmod{4(k+1)}$ tile $X_1 \\cap (\\{0\\} \\times \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nHence $T$ tiles $X_1$.\n\nNote that $(x,x+n(k+1))+(k+2,1) = (x+k+2,(x+k+2)+(n-1)(k+1))$.\\\nSince $k \\equiv 4 \\pmod 8$, if $x \\equiv 2n+r \\pmod 8$ then $x+k+2 \\equiv 2(n-1)+r \\pmod 8$. Hence $X_2$ is invariant under translation by $(k+2,1)$, by the definitions of $S_1$ and $S_3$. To show that horizontal copies of $T$ tile $X_2$, it is therefore enough to show that $T$ tiles the row $X_2 \\cap (\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\{0\\})$.\n\nWe can express $S_1$ as $\\{(y-n(k+1),y) \\; | \\; y \\equiv -n,1-n,2-n,3-n \\pmod 8\\}$.\n\nSimilarly $S_3 = \\{(y-n(k+1)-1,y) \\; | \\; y \\equiv 3-n,4-n,5-n,6-n \\pmod 8\\}$.\n\nTherefore $(-n(k+1),0) \\in S_1$ for $n \\equiv 0,1,2,3 \\pmod 8$, and $(-n(k+1)-1,0) \\in S_3$ for $n \\equiv 3,4,5,6 \\pmod 8$.\n\nHence $(x,0) \\notin X_2$ for $x \\equiv 0, 2(k+1)-1, 3(k+1)-1, 4(k+1)-1, 5(k+1)-1, 5(k+1), 6(k+1), \\newline 7(k+1) \\pmod{8(k+1)}$, so copies of $T$ beginning at positions $k+1, 3(k+1), 5(k+1)+1, 7(k+1)+1 \\pmod{8(k+1)}$ tile $X_2 \\cap (\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\{0\\})$.\n\nHence $T$ tiles $X_2$.\n\n$S_1 \\cup S_2 \\cup S_3$ can be partitioned into sets of the form $S = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3\\}$, where $x_1 = (x,y) \\in S_1$, $x_2 = (x+4,y+4) \\in S_2$, $x_3 = (x+2,y+3) \\in S_3$. Then $|S| = 3$, so we can construct the corresponding set $Y \\subset \\mathbb{Z}^3$ as in Lemma \\[biglemma\\]. Now, given $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, $(S \\times \\{n\\}) \\setminus Y = \\{x_i\\}$ for some $i \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$. Then $Y \\cap (X_i \\times \\{n\\}) = \\emptyset$. If we do this for all such sets $S$, and let $U$ be the (disjoint) union of the resulting sets $Y$, then $U \\cap (X_i \\times \\{n\\}) = \\emptyset$, and $\\mathbb{Z}^2 \\times \\{n\\} \\subset U \\cup (X_i \\times \\{n\\})$. Recall that $T$ tiles each $Y$ and therefore $U$.\n\nWe can do this for every $n$, choosing a partial tiling $X_i$ for the corresponding $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ layer. Together with $U$, these form a tiling of $\\mathbb{Z}^3$ by $T$. This completes the proof of Theorem \\[4mod8\\], and therefore also the proof of Theorem \\[mainthm\\].\n\nOpen problems\n=============\n\nTheorem \\[mainthm\\], together with the result that a punctured interval $T = \\underbrace{\\texttt{XXXXX}}_{k}\\!\\texttt{.}\\!\\underbrace{\\texttt{XXXXX}}_{k}$ does not tile $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ for $k \\geq 3$, determines the smallest dimension $d$ such that $T$ tiles $\\mathbb{Z}^d$ in the cases $k$ odd and $k \\equiv 4 \\pmod 8$. However, for other values of $k$, it is still unknown whether the smallest such dimension $d$ is 3 or 4:\n\nLet $T$ be the punctured interval $\\underbrace{\\texttt{\\emph{XXXXX}}}_{k}\\!\\texttt{.}\\!\\underbrace{\\texttt{\\emph{XXXXX}}}_{k}$, where $k \\equiv 0, 2, 6 \\pmod 8$, $k \\geq 6$. Does $T$ tile $\\mathbb{Z}^3$?\n\nIt is also natural to consider more general tiles. The next non-trivial case is that of an interval with a non-central point removed. One might wonder if there is an analogue of Theorem \\[mainthm\\] for these tiles:\n\nDoes there exist a number $d$ such that, for any tile $T$ consisting of an interval in $\\mathbb{Z}$ with one point removed, $T$ tiles $\\mathbb{Z}^d$?\n\nFor general one-dimensional tiles, Gruslys, Leader and Tan [@gltan16] conjectured that there is a bound on the dimension in terms of the size of the tile:\n\nFor any positive integer $t$, there exists a number $d$ such that any tile $T \\subset \\mathbb{Z}$ with $|T| \\leq t$ tiles $\\mathbb{Z}^d$.\n\nThis conjecture remains unresolved. The authors of [@gltan16] showed that if $d$ always exists then $d \\to \\infty$ as $t \\to \\infty$, by exhibiting a tile of size $3d-1$ that does not tile $\\mathbb{Z}^d$. This gives a simple lower bound on $d$; better bounds would be of great interest.\n\nAcknowledgements {#acknowledgements .unnumbered}\n================\n\nI would like to thank Vytautas Gruslys for suggesting this problem and for many helpful discussions, and Imre Leader for his encouragement and useful comments.\n\n[99]{}\n\nA.
