Because Joseph is ineligible for cancellation of removal, we will deny the\n\npetition for review.\n\n       Joseph entered the United States in December 1992 as a conditional resident. He\n\nbecame a permanent resident in December 1994. He was placed in removal proceedings\n\nby a notice to appear, dated June 15, 2005, which charged him with being removable for\n\nhaving committed a controlled substance violation and an aggravated felony. The\n\nImmigration Judge (IJ) found him removable for the controlled substance violation, but\n\nfound that the Government had not met its burden of showing that any of his convictions\n\nwas also an aggravated felony. The IJ found Joseph ineligible for cancellation of removal\n\nunder INA \u00a7 240A(a) [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a)], the only relief for which he applied.\n\n       The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed, specifically noting that the IJ\n\ndid not err in denying cancellation of removal, because Joseph had not accrued 5 years of\n\ncontinuous presence from the time he was admitted as a permanent resident in December\n\n\n\n\n   1\n     It is not clear if this is Petitioner\u2019s correct name. Petitioner filed his petition for\nreview under the name of \u201cGeorge Russell Joseph.\u201d His brief is signed \u201cRussell J.\nGeorge\u201d and alternatively refers to himself as \u201cMr. Russell.\u201d As our caption reflects the\nname he used in his petition for review, we will refer to petitioner as \u201cJoseph.\u201d\n                                              2\n\f1994 to the time he was convicted of a controlled substance violation in January 1998.2\n\nJoseph timely filed a petition for review and a motion for stay of removal.\n\n       Pursuant to section 242(a)(2)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) [8\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C)], we lack jurisdiction to review \u201cany final order of removal\n\nagainst an alien who is removable\u201d because of a controlled substance violation.\n\nHowever, the REAL ID Act of 2005 restored direct review of constitutional claims and\n\nquestions of law presented in petitions for review of final removal orders. See INA\n\n\u00a7 242(a)(2)(D) [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D)]; see Papageorgiou v. Gonzales, 413 F.3d 356,\n\n358 (3d Cir. 2005). We therefore may consider whether the BIA correctly applied the law\n\nin denying Joseph cancellation of removal.\n\n       Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b, the Attorney General may, in his discretion, cancel\n\nthe removal of an alien who has been: (1) lawfully admitted for permanent residence for\n\nnot less than five years, (2) if the alien has also continuously resided in the U.S. in any\n\nstatus for seven years, and (3) if the alien has not committed an aggravated felony.\n\nHowever, the calculation of the period of continuous residence required for relief stops\n\nwhen an alien commits a controlled substance violation. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(d)(1) [INA\n\n\u00a7 240A(d)(1)]. As the Government candidly explains in its brief, this \u201cstop-time\u201d\n\nprovision applies only to the second requirement listed above; i.e., that the alien has\n\n\n   2\n    The BIA noted that Joseph\u2019s argument that he had not committed an aggravated\nfelony was irrelevant, as he was not found removable on that ground, and that it could not\nentertain his arguments concerning his continued detention outside the context of bond\nhearings.\n                                              3\n\fcontinuously resided in the U.S. for seven years after having been admitted in any status.\n\nSee Matter of Perez, 22 I&N Dec. 689, 692 n.2 (BIA 1999) (en banc). The stop-time\n\nprovision does not apply to the first requirement. Id.\n\n       The BIA erroneously found that Joseph had not met the first requirement of five\n\nyears of permanent residence, since Joseph had been a permanent resident for over nine\n\nyears at the time of the IJ\u2019s decision. However, Joseph is ineligible for cancellation of\n\nremoval under the second step (lack of continuous residence for seven years), because\n\nJoseph, who was admitted to the United States in December of 1992, committed a\n\ncontrolled substance violation, triggering the statute\u2019s \u201cstop-time\u201d provision, in August of\n\n1997. He thus did not accrue seven years of \u201ccontinuous residence\u201d under the statute.3\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we will deny the petition for review.\n\n\n\n\n   3\n     In his brief, Joseph argues that he did not commit an aggravated felony. His\nargument is irrelevant, as he was not found removable for having committed an\naggravated felony. We agree with the Government that other issues in his brief regarding\nadjustment of status and parole for arriving aliens have no relevance to this petition for\nreview.\n\n       We note that Joseph also challenges his continued detention. Challenges to\npost-removal order detention should be raised in a habeas petition filed in the appropriate\nDistrict Court. See Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 687-88 (2001); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)\n(only eliminating district court's habeas jurisdiction over orders of removal).\n                                             4\n\f"
