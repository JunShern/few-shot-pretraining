    "text": "ALBANY \u2014 So why is it that the State of New York can tell the City of New York what to do with its streets?\n\nThe question is a natural one in light of a proposal unveiled on Friday to charge drivers who enter Midtown and Lower Manhattan, a congestion pricing plan that would raise money for mass transit.\n\nThe answer lies in Article IX of the New York Constitution, which outlines the state\u2019s responsibilities and powers over its local governments, including their very creation. Leverage over local affairs was codified in a 1929 case, Adler v. Deegan, which found so long as there was \u201csubstantial\u201d state interest, the Legislature could act on matters of \u201cproperty, affairs or government,\u201d an opinion \u2014 written by the jurist Benjamin Cardozo \u2014 that has been widely construed.\n\nEtc... Watt makes one Canadian guy wonder why NY State can override the city re any congestion charges, but the State is silent when NYC decides to clamp down on bettery-electric bicycles?\n\nMaybe NYC's best solution to the perceived Ebike problem is for them to form a new police unit, \"Division of Electric Bike Enforcement Special SWAT\" with a gaggle of officers riding custom built high powered mid-drive bikes dressed in Mutant Ninja Turtle costumes. Legalize ebikes completely and then the Turtles can appear out of nowhere at any time scaring the Pizza and Chinese food delivery commmunity into compliance and safe riding.\n\nThis plan of course would deprive a lot of middle aged neurotic citizens out of something to complain about and they might be forced to revert to filing complaints with the city about those annoying shoe mines left on sidewalks by urban dog owner's pets.\n\nFounded in 2000 as the print project of the New York City Independent Media Center, The Indypendent is a New York City-based free newspaper and online news site. We publish our print edition 13 times a year on Mondays. We also update our website daily and are active on Twitter and Facebook. We have a print and online audience of more than 100,000 readers. Winner of more than 50 awards from New York Community Media Alliance for excellence in journalism...\n\nEvery day, we are seeing developments in clean energy technology that move us toward renewable sources and away from fossil fuels. Electric power will define the future of our transportation; it\u2019s only a matter of how quickly our city embraces the change.\n\nCities across the country and around the world are beefing up their public transit by making bold investments in electric-powered vehicles, from electric buses to electric bicycles, to mitigate congestion and reduce emissions.\n\nYet here in New York City, we\u2019re still fighting the tide \u2014 with a backward, punitive approach.\n\nNothing exemplifies our mistake better than the city\u2019s attack on pedal-assisted, electric bicycles. For years, e-bikes have been a useful method of transportation for food delivery workers, many of whom earn as little as $30 a day and are forced to brace harsh weather.\n\nThese low-wage, often immigrant workers rely on e-bikes to make deliveries faster and easier. The small electric motor allows bike riders to travel at an average speed of 18 miles an hour, not much faster than a traditional bicycle and certainly much slower than a motorcycle or car.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget that before the e-bike, what generally transported our deliveries were gas-powered, air-polluting mopeds.\n\nWhile there has been no data to indicate that e-bikes are associated with higher crash or injury rates, the de Blasio administration has taken a punitive stance on e-bikes. In October 2017, Mayor de Blasio announced an unprovoked crackdown, saying that beginning in 2018, the NYPD would spearhead civil enforcement against businesses by allowing officers to issue civil summonses through the mail \u2014 in addition to getting a $100 fine for their first infraction.\n\nRiders caught operating an e-bike are subject to a civil summons, confiscation of the bike and a $500 fine.\n\nIt\u2019s true that e-bikes are technically illegal to operate on our streets. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a wise enforcement priority for the city. Of course, e-bikes, when used incorrectly, can be a nuisance to New Yorkers. But we should not blame the vehicle for the careless habits of the rider. If e-bike riders follow the same laws of the road as do nonelectric-bike riders, which they typically do, they should have the exact same access to our streets.\n\nOther cities have fully embraced e-bikes and are making them more accessible to commuters. San Francisco recently announced a 250 e-bike pilot program, while Baltimore and Birmingham, Ala., have integrated e-bikes into their bike-sharing schemes. Even Texas and Florida have more progressive e-bike laws than New York does.\n\nImagine if Citi Bike had the right to incorporate e-bikes into their bike-share model. The possibility of crossing one of the East River\u2019s many bridges without breaking a sweat would attract more New Yorkers to use that mode of transportation to get in or out of Manhattan, especially during the L train shutdown. This would reduce vehicular congestion and the strain on our already overburdened transit system.\n\nFor starters, the mayor should implement a moratorium on the NYPD\u2019s enforcement against electric bikes. And while he does that, Albany should act to legalize them. That is why I am introducing a City Council resolution in support of legislation sponsored by state Sen. Martin Dilan (D-Brooklyn) and Assemblyman David Gantt (D-Rochester), which would include electric-assisted bicycles in the definition of \u201cbicycle\u201d and thereby permit their use.\n\nNew York City is experiencing a public transit crisis right now; all you have to do is ask one of the millions of people who ride the subway daily. With crisis comes opportunity. We must seize this chance to rethink our transit systems and plan our city in ways that take advantage of new, clean technology. Electric bikes are a low-cost, ecofriendly and space-efficient option that we should embrace.\n\nGoing full steam ahead on electric transit \u2014 whether that means new public buses or bicycles \u2014 will bring us a long way toward reducing our carbon footprint, with big health and environmental benefits. While President Trump fights on the side of coal in the supposed war on the dirty fuel, we must insist on smarter and bolder solutions.\n\nThe way countries and cities all over the world are throwing money at electric bike buyers (\"tax rebates\", etc...), if I were Mister Mayor (NYC Mayor de Blasio) I'd be totally embarrassed. (\"Hiding under a rock\", etc)\n\nThe way countries and cities all over the world are throwing money at electric bike buyers (\"tax rebates\", etc...), if I were Mister Mayor (NYC Mayor de Blasio) I'd be totally embarrassed. (\"Hiding under a rock\", etc)\n\nDeBlasio is a closed minded person, like many politicians in NYC... Only money is a concern. Forget other people`s well being. It`s about De Blasio building HIS carrer. It`s all about not letting people have th power to use low cost and environnement friendly transportation. It`s not about what YOU NYorkers want... It`s about what the 0.0000001% who control the money in NYC want. NYC Manhattan is a Ghetto island. People who really live on this island only have time to work. Barely any time to sleep during the night. They basically give off their life for living in a closed door ghetto where you will end up dying if you dont get out quick. And your not allowed to have fun on an ebike even if you work 95 hr per week. NYC is boooooooooooorring.\n\nFast Company is a monthly American business magazine published in print and online that focuses on technology, business, and design and ebikes and stuff.\n\nNew York Is Confiscating Delivery Bikes, Hurting Immigrants, And Helping No One\n(\"The city\u2019s crackdown on electric bikes is destroying the livelihood of people who make deliveries for a living\u2013and shows how the gig economy platforms that pay them abdicate any responsibility to help.\"):https://www.fastcompany.com/40537103/ne ... ing-no-one\n\nIncludes:\n\nZhu, along with 60% of New York\u2019s 50,000 delivery cyclists, rides an electric bike (also known as an e-bike), cycles that are powered by motors built into the bike that allow the rider to transport themselves without having to work so hard to pedal. The majority of e-bike users in the city are, like Zhu, immigrants from China or Latin America who depend on delivery work to make a living. While it\u2019s also common to see messengers zipping around the city on regular bikes, those workers tend to be younger and U.S. born, and often take on delivery work as a supplement to other jobs.\n\n\"... 60% of New York\u2019s 50,000 delivery cyclists rides an electric bike...\" So, like about 30,000 electric bikes now in NYC alone?... and that's not counting personal ebikes??? Wonder where the writer gets their stats from...\n\nElectric bicycles \u2014 outfitted with battery-powered motors that can propel riders at sustained speeds of upwards of 20 mph \u2014 have become an increasingly familiar piece of Manhattan\u2019s streetscape in recent years. They\u2019ve become so common that an out-of-towner who didn\u2019t know better could be forgiven for thinking that the motorized bikes, favored by food delivery workers for their speed and ease of mobility, are a fully sanctioned mode of transportation in New York City.\n\nBut in spite of their ubiquity, e-bikes are, in fact, illegal to ride on city streets \u2014 and the city has gone to increased lengths to stamp out their use.\n\nFrom Jan. 1 to Feb. 11, the most recent period for which data is available, police seized 209 e-bikes and issued 238 moving summonses to e-bike users citywide.\n\n[Sigh] Includes a pic of the confused showing off their ill-gotten gains...\n\nProhibition in the United States was a nationwide constitutional ban on the production, importation, transportation, and sale of alcoholic beverages from 1920 to 1933.\n\nIn the 1920s the laws were widely disregarded, and tax revenues were lost. Very well organized criminal gangs took control of the beer and liquor supply for many cities, unleashing a crime wave that shocked the nation. By the late 1920s a new opposition mobilized nationwide. Wets attacked prohibition as causing crime, lowering local revenues, and imposing rural Protestant religious values on urban America. Prohibition ended with the ratification of the Twenty-first Amendment, which repealed the Eighteenth Amendment on December 5, 1933. Some states continued statewide prohibition, marking one of the last stages of the Progressive Era.\n\nNEW YORK (BRAIN) \u2014 Mayor Bill de Blasio on Tuesday announced that the city will allow use of pedal-assist e-bikes, but will continue to ban throttled e-bikes that are capable of speeds above 20 mph.\n\nThe state of New York does not regulate e-bikes, which remain technically illegal to use in the state, although legislation is pending in Albany.\n\nLast year de Blasio launched a campaign to crack down on e-bikes in the city, particularly throttled bikes used by delivery workers. But now he said he has instructed the city transportation department to begin the rule making process to allow pedal assist bikes.\n\nHehe... Careful... \"The city Department of Transportation plans to finalize a rule by this summer\"... Ya can maybe rely on \"civil servants\" and politicians to screw SOMETHING up. HOPEFULLY folks like ppl from NYCeWheels et al can get to them in time to give `em a \"proper ebike education\".\n\nYahoo! Finance is a media property that is part of Yahoo!'s network.

E-bikes are illegal to ride in New York City, and Li had been stopped by the police before. But this time the officer decided to seize his bike. Li was charged with misdemeanor reckless driving, no different than if he had been behind the wheel of a 4,000-pound SUV.\n\nIncludes:\n\nYet there is no hard evidence to suggest that e-bikes are more of a \"threat\" than traditional bicycles. The mayor has not cited any numbers to support his assertions. An NYPD spokesperson did not say whether the department keeps track of crashes that involve e-bikes.\n\nAt a transportation committee meeting for Manhattan's Community Board 7 in Janaury, NYPD Sergeant Felicia Montgomery said that last year, 86 pedestrians were hit by vehicles in the 20th Precinct, which stretches from West 59th Street up to West 86th. Just five of those crashes involved bikes. And of 58 crashes just involving bicycles, only one involved an e-bike.\n\nCaptain Leedroige Manuel, of the neighboring 24th Precinct, added, \"We're not seeing a lot of collisions with e-bikes.\"\n\nStreetsblog connects people to information about how to reduce dependence on private automobiles and improve conditions for walking, ebiking, and transit.

There are two main differences between the bikes used by deliverymen and those used by the wealthy: a typical delivery e-bike costs $1,500 and is controlled with a hand throttle, while the motor on the more-expensive bikes is controlled with the pedals.\n\nEnds: The Department of Transportation will hold a public comment session on May 29 at 1:30 p.m. at 55 Water St. in Manhattan.
