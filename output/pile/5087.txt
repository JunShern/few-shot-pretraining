Here are some of related results (Probably you know all of them):\n\nChen-Shen-Yuster proved that for any digraph $D$, there exists a vertex $v$ such that $|N^{++}(v)|\\geq\\gamma|N^+(v)|$, where $\\gamma=0.67815.$. See \"Second neighborhood via first neighborhood in digraphs\", Ann. Comb. 7 (2003), no. 1, 15\u201320. (Recall Seymour's second neighborhood conjecture asserts that $|N^{++}(v)|\\geq|N^+(v)|$ for some $v$.)\nFisher proved that Seymour's second neighborhood conjecture is true for tournament $D$, that is, the underlying graph of $D$ is a complete graph. See \"Squaring a tournament: a proof of Dean's conjecture\", J. Graph Theory 23 (1996), no. 1, 43\u201348. \nGhazal proved that Seymour's second neighborhood conjecture is true for tournaments missing a generalized star. See \"Seymour's second neighborhood conjecture for tournaments missing a generalized star\", J. Graph Theory 71 (2012), no. 1, 89\u201394. \n\n"
