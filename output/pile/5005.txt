WISSER, JUDGE PRESIDING\n\n\n\nM E M O R A N D U M   O P I N I O N\n\n\n\t\tA jury convicted Henry Gauna of aggravated sexual assault of a child.  See Tex. Penal\r\nCode Ann. \u00a7 22.021(a)(1)(B), (a)(2)(B) (West Supp. 2006).  Gauna elected to have punishment\r\nassessed by the trial court, which found that Gauna had previously been convicted of indecency with\r\na child and sentenced him to imprisonment for life in the Institutional Division of the Texas\r\nDepartment of Criminal Justice.  See id. \u00a7 12.42(c)(2)(A)(I), (c)(2)(B)(ii) (West Supp. 2006)\r\n(mandating life imprisonment for defendant convicted of aggravated sexual assault with prior\r\nconviction for indecency with child).  Gauna raises ten points of error on appeal, arguing that the\r\nevidence presented at trial is legally and factually insufficient to prove various elements of the crime\r\nand that the trial court erred by admitting certain testimony over Gauna's objection and allowing the\r\nseven-year-old complainant to testify by closed-circuit television.  We will affirm the trial court's\r\njudgment.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\n\t\tThe complainant, E.J.D., was six years old at the time of the events in question and\r\nseven years old at trial.  Since she was nine months old, E.J.D. has lived with her maternal\r\ngrandmother, Antonia Davis.  Samanthea Davis, E.J.D.'s mother, was fifteen years old when she\r\ngave birth to E.J.D. and abandoned her shortly thereafter, according to Antonia. (1)\n\t\tIn late September 2003, Antonia's car broke down, and Samanthea began providing\r\ntransportation to get Antonia and E.J.D. to and from work and school.  Samanthea would pick up\r\nAntonia and E.J.D. in time to get Antonia to work by 6:00 a.m., bring E.J.D. back to Samanthea's\r\napartment, then drive E.J.D. to school; she would pick up Antonia and E.J.D. in the afternoon. \r\nSamanthea and her two younger children shared an apartment with her sister Dorothea Contreras and\r\nContreras's child.  Around the same time, Samanthea started dating Gauna, who began spending\r\nmuch of his time at Samanthea's apartment.  Gauna frequently stayed overnight at the apartment.  \n\t\tOne morning in early October, Gauna accompanied Samanthea when she picked up\r\nAntonia and E.J.D.  A few days later, Gauna showed up alone at Antonia's house in Samanthea's\r\ncar.  Gauna explained that Samanthea was asleep, so he would be transporting Antonia and E.J.D. \r\nFor about a week and a half after that, Gauna arrived alone at Antonia's house every morning around\r\n5:30 a.m., took Antonia to work and E.J.D. to school, and picked them up in the afternoon. \n\t\tOn October 16, after having a heated argument with Gauna, Samanthea related some\r\ntroubling information about him to Antonia.  Antonia testified that this information caused her to\r\nquestion E.J.D. about whether \"Henry had touched her inappropriately in areas that he was not\r\nsupposed to.\"  Antonia continued that E.J.D. \"said yes, and she pointed to her chest and to her\r\nprivate part.\"  E.J.D. was acting nervous and scared, and Antonia reassured E.J.D. that she had not\r\ndone anything wrong and that she would not get in trouble for telling Antonia what happened.  E.J.D.\r\nthen described what Gauna had done:\n\n[A]fter [Gauna] would drop [Antonia] off at work, he would drive off to a--some\r\nparking lot with lots of trees and no lights and dark--dark place.  And then he would\r\nclimb in the back seat and pull [E.J.D.'s] pants down and put his thing in her piggy\r\nand start wiggling.\n\nE.J.D. and others testified that E.J.D. refers to her vagina as her \"piggy.\"  Antonia asked E.J.D. how\r\nmany times Gauna had done this to her.  While attempting to count on her fingers, E.J.D. first replied\r\nthat it had occurred thirteen times, then stated that Gauna did this twenty-seven times, according to\r\nAntonia.  Antonia also testified that E.J.D. related that, while most instances occurred in\r\nSamanthea's car, it had also happened in Samanthea's bed and in the living room of\r\nSamanthea's\u00a0apartment.\n\t\tAfter hearing these allegations, Antonia called Contreras to pick her up to take E.J.D.\r\nto a hospital.  Antonia stated that she did not call Samanthea both because she was not home and\r\nbecause \"Samanthea does not really concern herself about [E.J.D.]'s well-being.\"  When she arrived,\r\nContreras questioned E.J.D. about what Gauna had done to her.  Contreras testified that, although\r\nE.J.D. was hesitant to talk about it, she eventually told Contreras that in the mornings after Gauna\r\nhad dropped Antonia off at work, he drove E.J.D. to a \"dark place in a park-like area\" and got on top\r\nof her inside the car and kissed her.  Contreras then asked E.J.D. whether Gauna ever touched her\r\nbelow the waist, and she replied that he had.  \n\t\tAntonia and Contreras took E.J.D. to Brackenridge Hospital where she was examined\r\nby Dr. Stan Rice, an emergency room physician, shortly after midnight on October 17.  Rice testified\r\nthat E.J.D. was sleeping as he entered the room and that he had to wake her up to speak to her.  Rice\r\nstated that E.J.D. was shy and that he did not spend \"enough time to develop a significant rapport\"\r\nwith her.  Antonia testified that E.J.D. appeared to be nervous around Rice and did not want to talk\r\nto him, look at him, or have him touch her.  \n\t\tE.J.D. told Rice that something had happened to her but she was not quite sure what\r\nit was.  E.J.D. stated that Gauna laid on top of her and thrust his body back and forth.  When Rice\r\nasked E.J.D. whether Gauna's penis entered her vagina, rectum, or mouth, she replied that it had not;\r\nhowever, Rice testified that E.J.D. \"was not real clear on any of these details.\"  Antonia testified that\r\nRice did not use words like \"piggy\" that were familiar to E.J.D.  Rice testified that he attempted to\r\nexplain ejaculation to E.J.D. and that she stated that \"she wasn't sure that [Gauna] had spilled\r\nany\u00a0liquids onto her.\"\n\t\tRice performed a visual examination of the exterior of E.J.D.'s genitals and found\r\nno evidence of bruising, bleeding, or discharge from her vagina or rectum.  Rice did not use any\r\ninstruments to magnify the area he examined and did not examine the inside of E.J.D.'s vagina. \r\nBased on his conversation with E.J.D., the findings of his visual examination, and the information\r\nrelated by the hospital's social worker that the most recent alleged sexual assault was at least two\r\ndays prior and that E.J.D. had bathed since then, Rice concluded that a full examination by a sexual\r\nassault nurse examiner would not have been useful.  Nevertheless, Rice decided that \"calling CPS\r\n[was] warranted.\"  Antonia and E.J.D. met with representatives of Child Protective Services and the\r\nAustin Police Department at the hospital.  \n\t\tDr. Beth Nauert, the medical director of the Child Assessment Program, interviewed\r\nand examined E.J.D. on November 12, 2003, at the request of the Austin Police Department.  Nauert \r\ntestified,\n\n[E.J.D.] told me she had come to see me because she was touched by, quote, Henry,\r\nmy momma's boyfriend, end quote.  She stated that this would happen in the car. \r\nShe said, quote, one time he did it in the back seat and a lot of times he did it in the\r\nfront seat, end quote.  \n\nWhen I asked [E.J.D.] where Henry touched her, she pointed to her vaginal area. \r\nWhen I asked her what he touched her with, she says, quote, two things, his hand and\r\nhis thing, end quote.  When I asked her whether her clothes were on or off, she said\r\nthat her pants were off and her underwear was off and his pants were down and his\r\nboxers were down.\n\n[E.J.D.] said that Henry would touch her vaginal area, quote, inside, end quote. \r\nWhen I asked her what he told her, she said, quote, don't tell anyone or he'd never\r\nsee anyone or my mom again, end quote.\n\n\nAfter interviewing E.J.D., Nauert performed a physical examination.  Nauert used a colposcope (2) to\r\nexamine E.J.D.'s vaginal and rectal areas.  Nauert testified that E.J.D. had a normal genital\r\nexamination and a normal head-to-toe examination; Nauert found no injuries.  Nauert testified that\r\nshe was not surprised by the normal examinations because only around twenty-five percent of child\r\nvictims of sexual abuse with penetration have abnormal examinations.  Nauert explained that redness\r\nand swelling may disappear within a matter of hours and that bruises and tears can\r\nheal\u00a0over\u00a0a\u00a0few\u00a0days.\n\t\tE.J.D. began treatment with Helen Williams, a licensed professional counselor, in\r\nFebruary 2004.  Williams testified that she began treating E.J.D. for a variety of emotional and\r\nbehavioral issues, including encopresis, (3) enuresis, (4) fear of the dark, difficulty falling asleep,\r\naggressive behavior, hostility, and age-inappropriate behavior such as using \"baby talk\" and hiding\r\nfrom Antonia and other caregivers.  Williams stated that play therapy and art therapy were effective\r\nfor E.J.D. and that her problem behaviors and overall demeanor improved as she continued attending\r\ncounseling sessions with Williams.  Around July 2004, Antonia was notified that Gauna's trial was\r\napproaching; she asked Williams to talk to E.J.D. about testifying against Gauna in court.  Williams\r\ntestified that E.J.D.'s problem behaviors reappeared at that time: her encopresis and enuresis became\r\nmajor problems again, she started using \"baby talk\" and hiding from caregivers again, her sleeping\r\ndifficulty returned, and she began spending many nights on the bathroom floor with the light on.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nSufficiency of the Evidence\n Penetration\n\t\tIn his first and third points of error, Gauna argues that the evidence presented at trial\r\nis legally and factually insufficient to support a finding that he penetrated E.J.D.'s sexual organ. \r\nHowever, as the State notes, penetration is not an essential element of aggravated sexual assault. \r\nThe penal code provides that a person commits aggravated sexual assault if he intentionally or\r\nknowingly \"causes the sexual organ of a child to contact or penetrate the mouth, anus, or sexual\r\norgan of another person.\"  Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 22.021(a)(1)(B)(iii) (emphasis added).\n\t\tIn the indictment, the State alleged both that Gauna caused penetration of E.J.D.'s\r\nsexual organ with his sexual organ and that Gauna caused contact between E.J.D.'s sexual organ and\r\nhis sexual organ.  The State argued both theories in its closing arguments.  Even though some or all\r\nof the jurors may have relied on the penetration theory to reach a guilty verdict, any juror who\r\nbelieved beyond a reasonable doubt that Gauna's sexual organ penetrated E.J.D.'s sexual organ\r\nnecessarily believed that E.J.D.'s sexual organ contacted Gauna's sexual organ.  See Vick v. State,\r\n991 S.W.2d 830, 834 n.2 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999) (stating that penetration of genitals necessarily\r\nincludes contact); Hendrix v. State, 150 S.W.3d 839, 848 (Tex. App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 2004,\r\npet. ref'd) (rejecting challenge to lack of juror unanimity in case with similar pleadings \"because all\r\nof the jurors who believed there was penetration necessarily also believed that antecedent contact\r\nhad occurred\").  Because Gauna does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence supporting a\r\nfinding that he caused E.J.D.'s sexual organ to contact his sexual organ, we do not reach his first and\r\nthird issues.  See Johnson v. State, 23 S.W.3d 1, 7 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000) (limiting legal and factual\r\nsufficiency review to \"essential elements\").\n Identity\n\t\tIn his second and fourth points of error, Gauna argues that there is legally and\r\nfactually insufficient evidence to support a finding that he is the individual that sexually assaulted\r\nE.J.D.  Gauna bases this argument on E.J.D.'s inability to identify a photograph of Gauna at trial. \r\nOn direct examination by the State, the following exchange occurred:\n\nQ:  If I show you a picture of Henry, would you recognize him?\n\nA:  Yes.\n\nQ:  Okay.  I want to show you what's been marked as State's Exhibit number six and\r\nask you to look at this.  Do you recognize this?  Is there--does the person in this\r\npicture look familiar?\n\nA:  No.\n\nQ:  This person doesn't look familiar?\n\nA:  (Witness moving head side to side).\n\nQ:  You don't know who that is?\n\nA:  (Witness moving head side to side).\n\nQ:  Do you know what Henry looks like?\n\nA:  No.\n\n\n\t\tIn reviewing a legal sufficiency challenge, we look at all the evidence in the light\r\nmost favorable to the prosecution to determine whether a rational jury could have found the\r\nchallenged element beyond a reasonable doubt.  Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319 (1979);\r\nJohnson, 23 S.W.3d at 7.  When determining whether the evidence of a challenged finding is\r\nfactually sufficient, we review all the evidence in a neutral light and set aside the verdict only if it\r\nis so contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence that it is clearly wrong and unjust. \r\nJohnson, 23 S.W.3d at 6-7.  In conducting a factual sufficiency review, we must defer to the jury's\r\nfindings.  Cain v. State, 958 S.W.2d 404, 407 (Tex. Crim. App. 1997).  We may not reweigh the\r\nevidence and set aside a jury verdict simply because we feel that a different result is more\r\nreasonable.\u00a0\u00a0Id.\n\t\tAlthough E.J.D. was unable to identify a photograph of Gauna at trial, ample other\r\nevidence was presented linking Gauna to the sexual assault.  E.J.D. testified that the person who\r\nsexually assaulted her was her mother's boyfriend \"Henry\" who would take her grandmother to work\r\nand take E.J.D. to school.  E.J.D. testified that her mother only had one friend named Henry that took\r\nher to school.  The testimony of all the prosecution witnesses who spoke about what E.J.D. told them\r\nconcerning her sexual assault indicated that E.J.D. has always identified her assailant as her mother's\r\nboyfriend \"Henry\" who took her to school.\n\t\tAntonia identified Gauna as the man named Henry who was dating Samanthea in\r\nSeptember and October 2003 and as the man who took Antonia to work and E.J.D. to school. \r\nSamanthea also identified Gauna as the man named Henry whom she had dated and who took E.J.D.\r\nto school.  Likewise, Contreras identified Gauna as the man named Henry who began spending a lot\r\nof time at Samanthea's apartment in late September 2003 and who picked E.J.D. up in the mornings.\n\t\tDetective Robert Bowers of the Austin Police Department testified that when he\r\nspoke with Gauna, \"he confirmed that he . . . was seeing Samanthea.\"  Bowers also testified that,\r\nduring the investigation, he showed E.J.D. the same photograph that she was unable to identify at\r\ntrial, and she reacted by saying, \"That's Henry.\"\n\t\tA reasonable jury could have decided to credit the other evidence linking Gauna to\r\nthe crime despite E.J.D.'s inability to identify the photograph at trial.  The trial occurred over a year\r\nafter the last time seven-year-old E.J.D. had any contact with Gauna, and testifying at trial was a\r\nsource of significant stress for E.J.D.  Also, Bowers testified that he showed E.J.D. the same\r\nphotograph in a less stressful setting that was closer in time to E.J.D.'s most recent contact with\r\nGauna and that she identified the person in the photograph as \"Henry.\"  We hold that the evidence\r\npresented at trial is legally and factually sufficient to support a finding that Gauna is the person who\r\nsexually assaulted E.J.D.  Therefore, we overrule his second and fourth issues. \n Venue\n\t\tIn his fifth and sixth points of error, Gauna argues that the evidence presented at trial\r\nis legally and factually insufficient to demonstrate that the events occurred in Travis County.  Gauna\r\ncontends that the only evidence regarding where the sexual assaults occurred came from E.J.D., who\r\ncould not verify that the location is in Travis County.\n\t\tIn criminal cases, venue must be proved by a preponderance of the evidence.  Tex.\r\nCode Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 13.17 (West 2005).  The evidence may be either direct or circumstantial. \r\nBlack v. State, 645 S.W.2d 789, 790 (Tex. Crim. App. 1983); Gonzalez v. State, 784 S.W.2d 140,\r\n142 (Tex. App.--Austin 1990, no pet.).  In a sexual assault case, venue is proper \"in the county in\r\nwhich [the sexual assault] is committed, in the county in which the victim is abducted, or in any\r\ncounty through or into which the victim is transported in the course of the abduction and sexual\r\nassault.\"  Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 13.15 (West 2005).  The word \"abduction\" in this statute\r\nhas no technical meaning and does not necessarily require the use of force.  Cavazos v. State, 668\r\nS.W.2d 435, 438 (Tex. App.--Austin 1984, pet. ref'd).  Alternatively, if the county of the\r\ncommission of the crime cannot be determined, venue is proper in the county of the defendant's\r\nresidence or the county where the defendant was apprehended.  Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art.\r\n13.19 (West 2005).  Venue may be proved under any theory listed above even if the indictment only\r\nalleges that the offense was committed in the county of prosecution.  Id. art. 13.17.  \n\t\tThe jury heard evidence that Antonia's residence, Antonia's place of employment,\r\nand Samanthea's residence are all located in Travis County.  Evidence was also presented indicating\r\nthat Antonia was required to be at work by 6:00 a.m. everyday, and Samanthea testified that Gauna\r\nreturned to her residence with E.J.D. every morning by 6:10 a.m. at the latest.  This evidence allows\r\na reasonable inference that the sexual assaults were committed in Travis County or a reasonable\r\nconclusion that E.J.D. was abducted in Travis County.  \n\t\tAlso, although E.J.D. testified at trial that the sexual assaults only took place in\r\nSamanthea's car, Antonia testified that E.J.D. confided that Gauna had raped her in Samanthea's\r\napartment, which is located in Travis County.  Furthermore, if it is impossible to determine in which\r\ncounty the sexual assaults were committed, as Gauna contends, the record contains evidence\r\nsuggesting that venue was proper in Travis County because Gauna resided there.  Detective Bowers\r\ntestified that Gauna resided with his mother in Travis County at the time of the offenses; this\r\ntestimony was not controverted.  We hold that the evidence presented at trial is sufficient to support\r\na finding that venue was proper in Travis County.  We overrule Gauna's fifth and sixth issues.\nAdmission of Evidence\n Expert Testimony \n\t\tIn his seventh point of error, Gauna claims that the trial court erred by admitting the\r\ntestimony of Dr. William Carter, the State's expert witness who testified about child abuse dynamics,\r\nand Helen Williams, E.J.D.'s counselor who testified about E.J.D.'s behavioral issues.  Gauna insists\r\nthat the State used Williams's testimony to set up Carter's testimony, (5) in which he answered\r\nhypothetical questions based on the facts of the instant case.  Gauna contends that this testimony was\r\nimproperly admitted because it directly commented on E.J.D.'s truthfulness.\n\t\tWe review decisions on the admission of expert testimony for an abuse of discretion. \r\nEllison v. State, 201 S.W.3d 714, 723 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006).  Expert testimony is admissible where\r\nspecialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact in understanding the evidence or determining a fact\r\nin issue.  Tex. R. Evid. 702.  Expert testimony does not assist a jury if it constitutes \"a direct opinion\r\non the truthfulness\" of a child complainant's allegations.  Schutz v. State, 957 S.W.2d 52, 59 (Tex.\r\nCrim. App. 1997) (quoting Yount v. State, 872 S.W.2d 706, 708 (Tex. Crim. App. 1993)).  The State\r\nmay not elicit testimony that a particular child is telling the truth or that child complainants as a class\r\nare worthy of belief.  Yount, 872 S.W.2d at 712.\n\t\tHowever, expert testimony that provides useful background information to aid the\r\njury in evaluating the testimony of another witness is admissible.  For instance, expert testimony\r\nindicating that children who have been sexually abused sometimes give conflicting accounts of their\r\nabuse and even recant initial outcries is admissible to assist a factfinder in determining the\r\nimpeachment value of prior inconsistent statements by a complainant.  Pavlacka v. State, 892\r\nS.W.2d 897, 903 n.6 (Tex. Crim. App. 1994).  In addition, expert testimony explaining that a child\r\nexhibits behavioral characteristics that have been empirically shown to be common among children\r\nwho have been abused is admissible.  Cohn v. State, 849 S.W.2d 817, 819 (Tex. Crim. App. 1993);\r\nPerez v. State, 113 S.W.3d 819, 832 (Tex. App.--Austin 2003, pet. ref'd); Hitt v. State, 53 S.W.3d\r\n697, 707 (Tex. App.--Austin 2001, pet. ref'd); Vasquez v. State, 975 S.W.2d 415, 417 (Tex.\r\nApp.--Austin 1998, pet. ref'd).  The State may also elicit testimony concerning the typical\r\ncharacteristics of victims of sexual abuse.  Schutz, 957 S.W.2d at 69.\n\t\tCarter testified about the characteristics of child victims of sexual abuse, explaining\r\nthat they are usually abused by people known to the family, that they feel shame and confusion about\r\nthe abuse, that they often wait for long periods before making outcries, that they often tell more and\r\nmore of the story as time goes on, and how their situations are complicated when their abusers have\r\nrelationships with their other family members.  Carter also testified that certain hypothetical fact\r\nsituations, based on the facts in the instant case, are consistent with sexual abuse, although they do\r\nnot prove that abuse has occurred.  The following is one such exchange about\r\nwhich\u00a0Gauna\u00a0complains:\n\nQ:  Doctor, if you had a six-year-old child who was sexually abused by her mother's\r\nboyfriend and was asked directly by her grandmother whether anything happened to\r\nher, and she told her grandmother \"yes\" and made an outcry statement to the\r\ngrandmother that the boyfriend took her to a dark place in the car after he dropped\r\nthe grandma off at work and got on top of her, pulled his pants down, pulled her\r\npants down, put his thingy in her piggy, which was explained to be his penis and her\r\nvagina, and wiggled, would you--is that detailed information in an outcry?\n\nA:  If I got that information, I would be very cautious and I would be quite interested\r\nin knowing more about what the girl had to tell me.\n\nThe answer quoted above is as close as Carter ever came to a direct comment on truthfulness.  Carter\r\nnever claimed that the child accusers in the State's hypothetical situations were telling the truth, that\r\nE.J.D. was telling the truth, or that child complainants in sexual abuse cases always tell the truth. \r\nCarter was careful to speak in generalities and testified that it was not his position that E.J.D. had\r\nbeen sexually assaulted or that Gauna had sexually assaulted her.  \n\t\tBecause Carter limited his testimony to the general characteristics of child victims\r\nof sexual abuse and whether hypothetical fact situations are consistent with sexual abuse and because\r\nthe court of criminal appeals and this Court have upheld the admissibility of such testimony, the trial\r\ncourt did not abuse its discretion by admitting the testimony.  We overrule Gauna's seventh issue.\n Irrelevant, Unfairly Prejudicial, and Hearsay Evidence\n\t\tIn his eighth and ninth points of error, Gauna contends that the trial court erred by\r\nadmitting the testimony of Abby Stancik, an investigator with Child Protective Services, and Cyndi\r\nCantu, a forensic interviewer for the Center for Child Protection, because it was irrelevant, unfairly\r\nprejudicial, and contained inadmissible hearsay.  The subjects discussed during Stancik's testimony\r\nincluded the process used to investigate a claim of sexual abuse, her visits with E.J.D., E.J.D.'s\r\ndemeanor during those visits, and Samanthea's level of cooperation with Child Protective Services. \r\nCantu testified regarding her qualifications to interview children about sexual abuse, the procedures\r\ninvolved in such an interview, E.J.D.'s interview in particular, and E.J.D.'s demeanor\r\nduring\u00a0the\u00a0interview.  \n\t\tWe review a trial court's decision to admit evidence using an abuse-of-discretion\r\nstandard.  Sells v. State, 121 S.W.3d 748, 766 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003).  Evidence is relevant if it has\r\n\"any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the\r\naction more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\"  Tex. R. Evid. 401. \r\nEvidence must be relevant to be admissible.  Id. R. 402.  However, relevant evidence \"may be\r\nexcluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\"  Id.\r\nR. 403.  Trial judges are afforded significant discretion to make admissibility decisions under rule\r\n403.  Manning v. State, 114 S.W.3d 922, 926 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003).  We may not reverse a trial\r\njudge's ruling if it was within the zone of reasonable disagreement.  Id.  \n\t\tHearsay is an out-of-court statement \"offered in evidence to prove the truth of the\r\nmatter asserted.\"  Tex. R. Evid. 801(d).  In this context, a statement includes \"nonverbal conduct of\r\na person, if it is intended by the person as a substitute for verbal expression.\"  Id. R. 801(a)(2). \r\nHearsay is not admissible unless it is specifically permitted by the rules of evidence\r\nor\u00a0statute.\u00a0Id.\u00a0R.\u00a0802.  \n\t\tGauna insists that evidence concerning the process of investigating claims of sexual\r\nabuse was not relevant to the issue of whether Gauna committed sexual assault.  The State argues\r\nthat, because the defense questioned E.J.D.'s credibility, evidence of the safeguards employed in\r\ninvestigating claims of sexual abuse was relevant because it made the possibility that E.J.D. was\r\nlying less likely.  Indeed, Gauna argued to the jury that E.J.D.'s many interviews with investigators\r\nand counselors caused her to fabricate her allegations against Gauna to placate those seeming\r\nauthority figures.  Evidence that those who interviewed E.J.D. were trained to ask open-ended,\r\nnonleading questions and not to push children for answers certainly made this theory less likely\r\nand\u00a0was therefore relevant.  \n\t\tNext, Gauna contends that Stancik's and Cantu's testimony was more unfairly\r\nprejudicial than probative because it allowed the jury to infer that E.J.D. presented a consistent\r\naccount of the sexual assaults to different people throughout the investigation.  This testimony was\r\nlikely prejudicial to Gauna.  However, rule 403 only allows exclusion of relevant evidence where\r\nthe probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.  Id. R. 403.  The danger of\r\nunfair prejudice exists when the evidence creates an undue tendency to suggest a decision on an\r\nimproper basis such as an emotional one.  Erazo v. State, 144 S.W.3d 487, 501-02 (Tex. Crim. App.\r\n2004) (citing Rogers v. State, 991 S.W.2d 263, 266 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999)).  Here, the testimony\r\nof Stancik and Cantu, though it allowed an inference that E.J.D. told a consistent story, was not\r\nlikely to inflame the emotions of the jurors nor to invite a decision on any other improper basis.\n\t\tGauna also argues that Stancik's and Cantu's testimony violated the hearsay\r\nprohibition because it allowed the jury to infer the contents of E.J.D.'s out-of-court statements.  An\r\nout-of-court statement need not be directly quoted to run afoul of the hearsay rules.  Head v. State,\r\n4 S.W.3d 258, 261 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999).  Whether the testimony violates the hearsay prohibition\r\nturns on how strongly the contents of the out-of-court statement can be inferred from the context. \r\nId.  \"[T]he question is whether the strength of the inference produces an 'inescapable conclusion'\r\nthat the evidence is being offered to prove the substance of an out-of-court statement.\"  Id. at 262. \r\nHere, Stancik's and Cantu's testimony did not lead to an inescapable conclusion regarding what\r\nE.J.D. told them.  Each merely testified that the investigation continued after her interview with\r\nE.J.D.  A wide range of statements by E.J.D. could have caused the investigation to continue. \r\nNeither Stancik's nor Cantu's testimony allowed the jury to infer the details of what\r\nE.J.D.\u00a0said\u00a0out\u00a0of court.  \n\t\tGauna claims that Stancik's and Cantu's testimony also violated the hearsay\r\nprohibition by referring to E.J.D.'s nonverbal conduct that was intended as a substitute for verbal\r\nexpression.  See Tex. R. Evid. 801(a)(2).  Stancik testified that E.J.D. seemed to be sad and\r\ndepressed.  Cantu testified that at the beginning of their interview, E.J.D. was open, talkative, and\r\nplayful and that at one point her demeanor shifted and she became quiet and hesitant to talk and\r\nsucked on her fingers.  Gauna has not hypothesized, nor can we imagine what verbal expression\r\nE.J.D.'s glum affect and shift in demeanor were intended as a substitute for.\n\t\tFor the reasons discussed above, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its\r\ndiscretion by admitting the testimony of Stancik and Cantu over Gauna's objections that it was\r\nirrelevant and more unfairly prejudicial than probative and that it violated the hearsay prohibition. \r\nWe overrule Gauna's eighth and ninth issues.\nTestimony by Closed-Circuit Television \n\t\tIn his tenth point of error, Gauna asserts that the trial court erred and violated his\r\nSixth Amendment rights by allowing E.J.D. to testify through closed-circuit television.  See\r\nU.S.\u00a0Const. amend. VI.  \n\t\tThe use of closed-circuit television testimony does not violate the Confrontation\r\nClause if it is necessary to protect a child witness from significant emotional trauma caused by\r\nphysical confrontation with the defendant in a courtroom.  Maryland v. Craig, 497 U.S. 836, 855\r\n(1990); Marx v. State, 987 S.W.2d 577, 580 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999).  The trauma must be more than\r\n\"mere nervousness or excitement or some reluctance to testify.\"  Craig, 497 U.S. at 856.  The trial\r\ncourt must find that the child witness would be traumatized by the presence of the defendant, not by\r\nthe courtroom generally.  Id.  We review a trial court's decision to allow a child witness to testify\r\nby closed-circuit television for an abuse of discretion.  Marx, 987 S.W.2d at 581 n.2.\n\t\tAt the hearing on whether to allow E.J.D. to testify through closed-circuit television,\r\nAntonia and Helen Williams testified.  Antonia testified that E.J.D.'s problems with encopresis,\r\nenuresis, and \"baby talk,\" which began after she was sexually assaulted by Gauna, improved with\r\ntherapy but that E.J.D. regressed after being told that she would have to testify against Gauna in\r\ncourt.  Antonia testified that after E.J.D. attended \"court school,\" a program to familiarize children\r\nwith the courtroom setting, she began spending nights in the bathroom with the light on.  Antonia\r\nstated her opinion that E.J.D. would be traumatized if she had to be present with\r\nGauna\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0courtroom.  \n\t\tWilliams similarly testified that E.J.D.'s behavioral issues had been improving\r\nthrough therapy but that their severity increased as Gauna's trial date approached and E.J.D. began\r\npreparing to testify against Gauna.  Williams testified that she believed the use of closed-circuit\r\ntelevision was necessary to protect E.J.D.'s welfare and that E.J.D. would be traumatized if she had\r\nto face Gauna in the courtroom.  Williams relayed E.J.D.'s statements that \"she did not want to see\r\nHenry,\" \"she was afraid of Henry,\" \"she was really afraid that he would get out and come and get\r\nher; find her.\"  Before she testified at trial, E.J.D. was questioned by Gauna's attorney.  E.J.D. stated\r\nthat it would scare her to testify in front of Gauna, that she would rather not do that, and that she did\r\nnot think she could do it if she had to.\n\t\tOn these facts, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by finding that\r\nallowing E.J.D. to testify by closed-circuit television was necessary to protect E.J.D. from significant\r\nemotional trauma caused by physical confrontation with Gauna in the courtroom.  We overrule\r\nGauna's tenth issue.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n\t\tHaving overruled all of Gauna's points of error, we affirm the trial court's\r\njudgment\u00a0of conviction.\n \n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t__________________________________________\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDavid Puryear, Justice\n\nBefore Justices B. A. Smith, Patterson and Puryear\nAffirmed\nFiled:   December 29, 2006\nDo Not Publish\r\n1.  For convenience, we refer to Antonia Davis and Samanthea Davis by their first names.\r\n2.

Although Gauna's seventh issue challenges the admission of both Williams's and Carter's\r\ntestimony, Gauna makes no argument explaining why Williams's testimony was inadmissible. \r\nGauna only states that \"[t]he prosecutor used Helen Williams to set up Dr. Carter's testimony as she\r\ndescribed the behavioral issues which the complainant experienced.\"  We hold that the portion of\r\nthe issue relating to Williams's testimony is inadequately briefed and therefore waived.
