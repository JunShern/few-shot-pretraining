    "text": "The Christian includes, he does not close the door to anyone, even if this provokes resistance. He who excludes, because he believes himself to be better, generates conflicts and divisions, and does not consider the fact that \u201cwe shall all stand before the judgment seat of God.\u201d That was the message of Pope Francis during Thursday morning\u2019s Mass at Casa Santa Marta.\n\nIn the Letter to the Romans, St. Paul exhorts us not to judge and not to despise our brothers, because, the pope said, this leads to excluding them from \u201cour little group,\u201d to being selective, and this is not Christian.\u201d Christ, in fact, \u201cwith his sacrifice on Calvary\u201d unites and includes \u201call men in salvation.\u201d In the Gospel, publicans and sinners draw near to Jesus \u2013 \u201cthat is, the excluded, all those that were outside,\u201d \u2013 and \u201cthe Pharisees and the scribes complained\u201d:\n\n\n\u201cThe attitude of the Scribes and the Pharisees is the same, they exclude. [They say,] \u2018We are the perfect, we follow the law. These people are sinners, they are publicans\u2019; and the attitude of Jesus is to include. There are two paths in life: the path exclusion of persons from our community and the path of inclusion. The first can be little but is the root of all wars: all calamities, all wars, begin with an exclusion. One is excluded from the international community, but also from families, from friends \u2013 How many fights there are! \u2013 and the path that makes us see Jesus and teaches us Jesus is quite another, it is contrary to the other: to include.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not easy to include the people,\u201d Pope Francis said, \u201cbecause there is resistance, there is that selective attitude.\u201d For this reason, Jesus tells two parables: the parable of the lost sheep, and the parable of the woman and the lost coin. Both the shepherd and the woman will do anything to find what they have lost, and when they find it, they are full of joy:\n\n\u201cThey are full of joy because they have found what was lost and they go to their neighbours, their friends, because they are so happy: \u2018I found, I included.\u2019 This is the \u2018including\u2019 of God, against the exclusion of those who judge, who drive away people, persons: \u2018No, no to this, no to that, no to that\u2026\u2019; and a little of circle of friends is created, which is their environment. It is a dialectic between exclusion and inclusion. God has included us all in salvation, all! This is the beginning. We with our weaknesses, with our sins, with our envy, jealousies, we all have this attitude of excluding which \u2013 as I said \u2013 can end in wars.\u201d\n\nJesus, the pope said, acts like his Father, who sent him to save us; \u201cHe seeks to include us,\u201d \u201cto be a family.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe think a little bit, and at least \u2013 at least! \u2013 we do our little part, we never judge: \u2018But this one has acted in this way\u2026\u2019 But God knows: it is his life, but I don\u2019t exclude him from my heart, from my prayer, from my greeting, from my smile, and if the occasion arises I say a good word to him. Never excluding, we have no right! And how Paul finishes the Letter: \u2018We shall all stand before the judgment seat of God . . . then each of us shall give an account of himself to God.\u2019 If I exclude I will one day stand before the judgment seat of God, I will have to give an account of myself to God. Let us ask the grace of being men and women who always include, always, always! in the measure of healthy prudence, but always. Not closing the doors to anyone, always with an open heart: \u2018It pleases me, it displeases me,\u2019 but the heart is open. May the Lord grant us this grace.\u201d"
