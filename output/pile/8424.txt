    "text": "We see patterns where none exist. It\u2019s what humans do; in fact, it\u2019s what animals do. Mark Twain noticed this, and had a pithy summary.\n\nWe should be careful to get out of an experience only the wisdom that is in it \u2014 and stop there; lest we be like the cat that sits down on a hot stove-lid. She will never sit down on a hot stove-lid again \u2014 and that is well; but also she will never sit down on a cold one any more.\n\nThe wary cat has a theory of the world: Stove burns you. Stay away from stove.\n\nOf course, only hot stoves cause burns, so this is not a good theory. But consider two cats:\n\nCat A believes (correctly) that the theory about stoves causing burns is incomplete, and is not sure what does cause burns.\n\nCat B stays far away from all stoves, hot or cold, because they magically cause pain and injury in a way the cat doesn\u2019t understand.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty clear that Cat B is more likely to survive.\n\nThe Conspiracy-Theory Mindset\n\nAn interesting paper, forthcoming in the European Journal of Social Psychology, titled \u201cConnecting the Dots: Illusory Pattern Perception Predicts Belief in Conspiracies and the Supernatural,\u201d investigates this kind of thinking.\n\nThe central finding is that many people who believe in complex conspiracies and supernatural phenomena also see \u201cpatterns\u201d in random data. The authors conclude that \u201cillusory pattern perception is a central cognitive mechanism accounting for conspiracy theories and supernatural beliefs.\u201d\n\nWe want someone to blame.\n\nThe interesting part is that humans also add a moral element. We want someone to blame. In the case of the human analogue of stoves \u2014 perhaps droughts, floods, or natural disasters \u2014 primitive peoples think that angry gods or malevolent forces can be appeased by appropriate human actions. They make sacrifices, and if something bad happens to someone, they imagine that evil forces are at work, or else the person somehow deserved the punishment for having themselves acted badly.\n\nI\u2019m not saying this is a conscious, rational response. Quite the contrary. It\u2019s the irrational part of this that makes it adaptive. The belief that I can understand, and take actions to prevent, terrible events is a key part of being happy, and even healthy.\n\nAs I pointed out in my Analyzing Policy (2000) book, the belief that pork contained evil spirits, or that God had commanded that no one eat pork, proved adaptive in desert regions where deadly invisible parasites were likely to infest the meat. You didn\u2019t have to understand the mechanism, as long as you happened upon a good rule and then imbued that rule with magical significance.\n\nA Disaster without an Explanation\n\nOne of the most famous catastrophes in European history was the Lisbon earthquake of 1755, in Portugal. The earthquake itself caused fires immediately, as well as a tsunami that arrived in about 40 minutes. All told, between 10,000 and 100,000 people died.\n\nThe question asked throughout Enlightenment-era Europe was, \u201cWhat did Lisbon do to deserve such punishment?\u201d There were some theories, including religion, sexual mores, and some more fanciful claims, but it seemed hard to believe that these could explain why Lisbon would be almost completely destroyed and Berlin, Paris, Prague, Vienna, and other capitals of sin would be untouched.\n\nUnless \u2026 what if there was no explanation? No one had done anything, good or bad, to cause it. The earthquake just happened.\n\nNow, humans usually don\u2019t like answers like that; we can\u2019t plan, and we can\u2019t identify patterns.\n\nOn the other hand, accepting that there may be no explanation, much less a blame-worthy action as cause, for events is a step toward thinking scientifically. In a way, the Lisbon earthquake was a great benefit to the cause of enlightenment. As John Hamer said,\n\nOne of modernity\u2019s greatest achievements is the realization that natural disasters like earthquakes have nothing to do with us, that we need not see the wrath of Zeus in every thunderclap, the displeasure of Poseidon in every menacing wave. The origins of that realization are to be found in the smoldering ashes of Lisbon.\n\nBacksliding on Scientific Modernity\n\nIt\u2019s easy to slide back though. And maybe it\u2019s just my imagination, but we seem to be sliding backward pretty fast. After Hurricane Katrina, a few religious leaders went all \u201cwrath of God\u201d on us, claiming that New Orleans was a modern Gomorrah. After Hurricane Harvey this summer, and again after Hurricane Maria, we were told that Houston, and Puerto Rico, must have done something to deserve this terrible punishment.\n\nSometimes the \u201csin\u201d is promoting \u201cthe homosexual agenda,\u201d of course. Folks on the left tend to think that this kind of religious view is ridiculous, but they are happy to trot out their own \u201cyou deserved it!\u201d line of pattern recognition. For the Left, the sin is often the use of fossil fuels. In fact, after Harvey happened to stop in place for 48 hours, immobilized by an utterly random high pressure area to the north, several clear \u201ccauses\u201d emerged. One was global warming. Another (I love this one) was \u201clack of zoning.\u201d Houston, thou has sinned in the eyes of the planners of urban sacredness, and thou willst now suffer the consequences!\n\nIn fact, as a number of people have pointed out, the scientific basis for blaming the specific path or effects of one hurricane on any one factor is extremely tenuous. It\u2019s unlikely that global warming or lack of zoning caused that specific event and its effects.\n\nThe rise in the temperature of the Gulf of Mexico at this point is less than 1 degree centigrade; the amount of rain dropped by Harvey was actually within normal bounds for a hurricane of that size.\n\nAnd as for zoning, well, the amount of impermeable paved area in the city doubtless contributed to the severity of the flooding, but 50 inches of rain in two days would not have been \u201csoaked up\u201d by swamps or sloughs; once the ground is saturated, it\u2019s covered with water. And water is impermeable, too.\n\nThe difficult thing, and I\u2019d say this to all sides, is to discipline yourself to avoid two atavistic moralistic traps.\n\nBlame the victim: If you see something bad, you find something about the victim you don\u2019t like. And then you say the bad thing happened because the victim did something bad. For example, Puerto Rico allowed promiscuity, or Houston did not have zoning rules to limit growth. Vengeful gods: If you see something bad, you find something that society as a whole is doing you don\u2019t like. For example, we use fossil fuels, so hurricanes become stuck by high pressure areas, or people have stopped going to church, and so an example had to be made.\n\nAs Ron Bailey wrote in Reason, there is no overall trend toward worsening intensity, duration, or frequency of hurricanes hitting the United States. There are plausible theories that predict that this may happen, and there are sensible reasons to evaluate these claims seriously.\n\nBut it\u2019s a violation of the basic scientific principles of the Enlightenment to blame the victims, or to invoke vengeful gods, as explanations. Sometimes things happen. Noticing patterns where none exist is part of being human. Overcoming that impulse is the most important part of science."
