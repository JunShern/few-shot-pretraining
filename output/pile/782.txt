    "text": "The Doctor Patient Relationship; what if Communication Skills are not used? A Maltese Story.\nThe doctor patient relationship is fundamental to the practice of medicine. In the UK, much work has been carried out to develop taining in communication skills for both doctors and medical students. Whereas it is true that controled trials of communication skills are now beginning to emerge in the primary care literature, it is also true that there is need for studies of communication skills on the hospital ward. One alternative form of evidence for the need of communication skills is that of anthropological studies of hospital wards. We here summarise the observations made in one such anthropological study which was carried out in a renal unit in Malta. The conclusion of these observations is that the inability of the doctors to utilise communication skills is that patients develop meaningful relationships with other groups of professionals, to the extent that they consider them as part of an extended family. Doctors remain isolated from all these relationships and only relate to patients from a position of power."
