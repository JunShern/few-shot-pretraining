She takes the words of heavyweights such as Warren Bennis, Peter Senge, Stephen Covey, Marshall Goldsmith, Peter Block, and Margaret Wheatley, and presents their insights on what works and what doesn\u2019t. Each chapter concludes with a practical application section that details ways to integrate the concepts into workshops and personal development.\n\nUse the workshop and personal development suggestions to apply the eight practices into your daily life.\n\nLearn from the words and personal stories of highly respected leaders.\n\nIntegrate the best of yourself and your life into your daily tasks and roles.\n\nThis book is for anyone in a position of influence in an organization, or those who train these individuals. It\u2019s also for those who feel they are drowning in information, but starving for wisdom about what behaviors nurture people, organizations, and communities at large. Discussing her research process with these experts, Jann says, \"When I asked about leadership\u2014they told me about life.\" This book helps leaders integrate the best of themselves and their lives into the tasks and roles of leaders.\n\nJann E. Freed, is a Leadership Development and Change Manage\u00adment Consultant with the Genysys Group. She primarily works with individuals and businesses in the Midwest to transition\n\u2014to get from where they are to where they want to be. She has worked with compa\u00adnies such as Wells Fargo, Principal Financial Group, Vermeer Manu\u00adfacturing, Nationwide, and Meredith Corporation. She is professor emerita of business management and the former Mark and Kay De Cook Endowed Chair in Leadership and Character Development at Central College in Pella, Iowa where she joined the faculty in 1981. She earned her PhD from Iowa State University, MBA at Drake University, and undergraduate degree in business manage\u00adment from Central College. She is the co-author of four books\n\u2014three on continuous im\u00adprovement in higher education and a book on learner-centered assess\u00adment on college campuses. You can learn more about Jann at www.JannFreed.com.\n\nThere are leadership practices and there are leadership practices, but not all of them matter. Jann Freed, in her relentless research over several years, has gathered the wisdom, insights, and practices of leaders she has identified as 'sages,' and has distilled from all that material the things that really matter in leadership. I only wish I'd had this book when I was a young manager trying to be a leader. Read this, then give a copy to every aspiring leader you know, as well as to those who are in leadership positions but haven't figured out yet what really matters.\n\nChristina Baldwin\n\nAuthor of Storycatcher, Making Sense of our Lives through the Power and Practice of Stories and The Circle Way: A Leader in Every Chair (with Ann Linnea)\n\nLeading With Wisdom is a welcome addition to the thinking of millions of Boomers who are at the turning point of their generational life: from leading the pack of doing to leading the pack of reflecting. This book will help today's 55-75 year olds support the generations we are mentoring. No matter where you fall in the spectrum of professional life, Jann Freed\u2019s thoughtful research and stories will inform and inspire.\n\nRichard Leider\n\nAuthor of Repacking Your Bags and The Power of Purpose\n\nThrough enlightening interviews and wise commentary, Jann Freed reveals the secrets of great leadership and shows us a path to purposeful sage-ing. A profoundly relevant book for every leader today.\n\nMargaret J. Wheatley\n\nAuthor of many books, most recently: So Far From Home: Lost and Found in Our Brave New World.\n\nThis book is exactly what we need to find our way during this chaotic and troubling time. Other cultures have always relied on wisdom keepers\u2014those elders who have lived with awareness and discernment. It's time for us to realize that we cannot survive without such wisdom\u2014wisdom that is always simple, clear, and eternally true.\n\nJudi Neal\n\nAuthor of Edgewalkers: People and Organizations that Take Risks, Build Bridges, and Break New Ground and Enlightened Organizations: Four Gateways to Spirit at Work\n\nIf you read the business headlines, it is easy to believe that wisdom is sorely lacking in our leaders and organizations, and that it is desperately needed. It is true that greater wisdom is desperately needed. And this book is full of wisdom from leadership sages, wisdom you can use immediately in your own leadership, because it\u2019s been there in you all along. It is a book of hope and inspiration. Jann Freed\u2019s stories and research give you the courage to live your deepest principles and to embrace these eight powerful, meaningful and effective leadership practices. We all need to be living in alignment with these, wherever we show up. That would be heaven on earth.\n\nPeter Block\n\nAuthor of Flawless Consulting: A Guide for Getting Your Expertise Used and Community: The Structure of Belonging\n\nI can easily recommend Jann\u2019s book as it is a vote for restoring our humanity. This is much needed in this instrumental world, especially among those concerned with leadership. The book is also written with a light and flowing touch which offers the ideas in a very accessible way."
