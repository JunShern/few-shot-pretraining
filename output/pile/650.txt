    "text": "1. Field of the Invention\nThe present invention relates generally to gaming, and more particularly to a device and method for dispensing game tickets for playing games of chance for monetary prizes.\n2. Description of the Prior Art\nGaming is a widely popular form of entertainment and an economically important industry. State-run lotteries and other games of chance produce significant amounts of revenue for funding various socially beneficial activities such as education, economic development, etc.\nIn the private sector, games of chance are often used for both fundraising and entertainment purposes. For example, various charitable, social and fraternal organizations purchase sets of game materials consisting of game cards and tickets. Game cards typically have break-open windows or scratch-off areas for concealing winning and losing symbols prior to purchase. Game tickets are typically folded and sealed for concealing winning and losing symbols prior to purchase. Players unfold them to reveal the symbols as the games are played. Winning game symbols typically entitle the players to monetary prize amounts. The games can be designed with predetermined payout percentages. The game operators are thus assured of predetermined profit amounts after all of the cards or tickets are sold and all of the prizes are awarded.\nThe prior art includes various devices for packaging, promoting, displaying, and dispensing game cards and tickets. For example, folded-and-sealed tickets have for many years been placed in transparent glass and plastic jars, thus acquiring the designation \"jar ticket\". However, jars are not well suited for packaging with modern, high-speed packaging equipment. Moreover, jars can be impractical to ship due to their size, shape, weight, and susceptibility to breakage. Cardboard boxes are therefore preferred for packaging and shipping game cards and tickets. However, a disadvantage with many of the cardboard boxes currently used for packaging and shipping game cards and tickets is that they are not particularly convenient for dispensing tickets. Game operators must therefore transfer the cards and tickets to other containers, such as jars, for display and sale. Although this distribution system is in widespread use, the labor and inconvenience associated with handling and transferring large volumes of cards and tickets are significant disadvantages.\nThe present invention addresses the disadvantages of previous devices and methods of packaging, shipping, displaying, and distributing cards and tickets for playing games of chance. Heretofore there has not been available a game ticket dispenser and dispensing method with the advantages and features of the present invention."
