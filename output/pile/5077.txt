    "text": "Writing. Information. Inspiration. Sarcasm guaranteed.\n\nPost navigation\n\nThe Cardinal Sin of Romance\n\nI love my fellow writers on this site. They offer me support and encouragement when I need it the most. Every one of them has read my work and offered invaluable feedback. But I must say, both Michelle and Amanda are quite\u2026selective in their reading. Neither of them favor the romance genre. I truly believe that neither of them would have ever read a romance in their lives had I not requested their assistance in beta reading/editing my work.\n\nI love them dearly, but I get the feeling that romance disgusts them on a fundamental level. They\u2019ve asked me to kill my characters. But that would NOT a romance make. They take the phrase \u201ckill your darlings\u201d literally. I merely torture mine, then ensure they at least have a happy ending for the moment. I don\u2019t think I can even write anything but romance. It\u2019s not in my blood to spill blood.\n\nMichelle and Amanda tease me incessantly about my inability to commit MC (main character) murder. I cannot do it. Well, at least I haven\u2019t yet. I may at some point in my career, but today is not that day and tomorrow isn\u2019t looking good either.\n\nBy definition, romance must have a HEA (happily ever after) or a HFN (happily for now). You cannot kill the MC or multiple MCs and still have the story remain a romance by definition. It may have romantic elements, but it\u2019s not by trade definition a romance.\n\nSome of the best stories have elements of romance in them but the MCs die.\n\nRomeo and Juliet ~ NOT a romance.\n\nTerminator ~ NOT a romance.\n\nTitanic ~ NOT a romance.\n\nSee where I\u2019m going with this\u2026the stories themselves have romance elements, but they are obviously not the main plot. Although Romeo and Juliet could be contested otherwise\u2026but it\u2019s obvious love is NOT enough\u2026especially when you have a sadistic writer. Yes, I\u2019m looking directly at you guys (you know who you are).\n\nSerial murderers you are, the lot of you. I swear sometimes I think you do it just for fun. Okay, so I know you don\u2019t just do it for shits and giggles. But the thought of killing off one of my main characters gives me feels deep down to my bones. I\u2026*sniffles*\u2026I can\u2019t do it.\n\nBut I\u2019m going to take my own advice and put myself out there, try something I\u2019ve never done before in my own writing, slip outside my comfort zone and test the limits of my strength as a writer.\n\nOTOH, it\u2019s not about the murder. The murdered character becomes uninteresting as soon as he/she\u2019s dead. Much more important are the survivors and their struggle out of the abyss this death hurled them into.\n\nIt may be the definition of romance -now-, darling, but I live to challenge the rules. I\u2019ve fully admitted to this cardinal sin; even using exactly that phrase. On a serious note, for me it was incredibly hard, it really was, because I LOVED the character I had to sentence to death. But in my Writerly bones, I knew\u2026that was just how the story had to go. In order to make way for the true tale to unfold, my beloved Darling had to die.\n\nThat being the case, you DON\u2019T have to kill off an MC. You have to do what\u2019s right for the story. I\u2019m all for stretching your writerly boundaries and applaud you thusly, but don\u2019t feel bad if its not part of your unique tales. \ud83d\ude42 just be true to the story.\n\nTwo basic elements comprise every romance novel: a central love story and an emotionally satisfying and optimistic ending.\n\nA Central Love Story: The main plot centers around individuals falling in love and struggling to make the relationship work. A writer can include as many subplots as he/she wants as long as the love story is the main focus of the novel.\n\nAn Emotionally Satisfying and Optimistic Ending: In a romance, the lovers who risk and struggle for each other and their relationship are rewarded with emotional justice and unconditional love.\n\nIf you kill a main character (one of the couple) or they do not end up together, then it\u2019s not considered a romance.\n\nYou can have romance elements in any story and kill whomever you please, but I personally don\u2019t consider it a romance if they don\u2019t end up together or one of them dies. No.\n\nThanks for the response and I\u2019m glad you posted the \u201crules. Because IMO (I\u2019m writing a hybrid memoir like project that may or may not be considered a romance) \u201cemotional justice and unconditional love\u201d can come even if a character dies. Or even if the characters don\u2019t end up together. Needs to be a satisfying reason why, but could work. Like Time Traveller\u2019s Wife.\n\nTrue. But I\u2019m going off of what I look for when I read romance. I prefer a HEA or HFN. Life is hard enough without having to deal with the \u201cmeh, go our separate ways\u201d or \u201cone of them dies\u201d endings. I personally won\u2019t read them if I know those are the endings, which is why they aren\u2019t normally included in the genre of romance. They\u2019re normally published as general fiction or literary fiction.\n\nWhen I read something, I want to know that they\u2019re building a life together after I close the book. Again, this is my personal preference. \ud83d\ude42\n\nThere are actually to be the variety of dreams like that to take into considerationwe would Thright into could be a factors level advertising and marketing convey comfortably. simply put i offer the basic questions above amale masturbator normal inspiration however most likely there are diseases like the moreover you convee up the instance crucial thing can be cropping in sincere good faith. .
