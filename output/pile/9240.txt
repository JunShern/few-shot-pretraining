For your FREE Daily Horoscope Monday 16th January 2017 please see below...\n\nHoroscopes Monday 16th January 2017\n\nAries 21 March - 20 April\n\nYou may be keen to get the week off to a positive start by rounding up any overdue tasks and completing them. But in practice, you might find that events occurring out of the blue can deflect attention. There's also a suggestion that an issue may be playing on your mind, and even though it might not be anything major, the coming days can be a call to resolve this for peace of mind.\n\nTaurus 21 April - 21 May\n\nYou may find that when it comes to socializing, spending time with those you cherish can leave you feeling relaxed as well as giving you the chance to discuss an idea or decision. The current picture suggests that there may be many who you could confide in, but allowing your instincts to guide you can be better. Indeed, your oldest friends might know just what to say Taurus.\n\nGemini 22 May - 21 June\n\nIt may seem as though your efforts are yielding few results over coming days, as a key alignment involving action-orientated Mars and sobering Saturn could be a cause of delays. But this might also be an opportunity to slow down and think about what you're hoping to do. Whether it's a step towards a goal or an opportunity you're keen to grasp, a pause for thought could help.\n\nCancer 22 June - 23 July\n\nThis can be one of those times when if you have something to say it's best to be honest. Although the celestial backdrop hints that new doors can open by speaking out, there may be some hesitation due to what others think. You could find though, that this matters a lot less than it seems, and that by revealing your thoughts a certain person might follow your example.\n\nLeo 24 July - 23 August\n\nTwo conflicting urges may be at the heart of a dilemma, and could leave you wondering how far you can trust others with something that may be dear to your heart. If you're seeking advice concerning a project or a relationship, the thought of potential criticism might be enough to turn you away. Even so, such fears may be unfounded as a fresh perspective can prove healing.\n\nVirgo 24 August - 23 September\n\nAlthough your approach to a certain relationship may be open and accepting, the Moon in your sign and its edgy links suggest that it might be an idea to look to the details too. Whether this is someone you've recently met or someone you know well, they may unknowingly share some inaccurate advice. Taking the time to check it out first could save you much inconvenience.\n\nLibra 24 September - 23 October\n\nIf you can stand back and consider your priorities it may be helpful, especially if you're keen to make a breakthrough over coming days. Time for reflection on your present situation might enable you to sidestep one or two potential delays, especially when it comes to getting any urgent tasks completed. Above all, your horoscope suggests that a can-do approach could enable you to deftly avoid any blips.\n\nScorpio 24 October - 22 November\n\nWith Mercury now moving further into your sector of thought and communication, you may feel motivated to put ideas down on paper and perhaps to plan for the weeks and months ahead. Indeed, setting goals, whether bigger or smaller, can be a way to stay on track. Looking to purchase a big-ticket item? Resourcefulness could help you net an excellent sale bargain, Scorpio.\n\nSagittarius 23 November - 21 December\n\nWhile it can help to stand your ground in a wavering situation, you may find that the willingness to give way on one or two points might greatly ease matters over the days ahead. This may be the case where a domestic issue is concerned, as the situation could change from one day to the next. A flexible response might be needed so as to obtain the best solution for all.\n\nCapricorn 22 December - 20 January\n\nThe coming days can be a time to delight in small successes, as bigger plans may require patience to get results. While you are often known for your ability to persevere despite obstacles, you may find that any complications you face could be a good thing if they encourage you to go back to the drawing board. Indeed, clarifying certain details can enable a more productive outcome.\n\nAquarius 21 January - 19 February\n\nJupiter's sparkling link to innovative Uranus could be of help in a situation in which tried and trusted methods may not seem to be working. This lively focus can pave the way for discussion that may yield some inspired ideas. Certain others might need some persuading though Water-Carrier, especially if they have a vested interest in things remaining exactly as they are for now.\n\nPisces 20 February - 20 March\n\nIt can seem as though someone in authority isn't listening to what you have to say, but is this the reality? It may be that by approaching them and talking things through a compromise can be found. The present scenario hints that delegating certain responsibilities might leave you with more time to yourself, especially if you have a full on and busy schedule in coming days."
