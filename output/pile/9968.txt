JONES, Circuit Judge:\n      Appellant Lonny Acker is a General Motors, L.L.C. (\u201cGM\u201d) employee who\nwas approved for intermittent Family and Medical Leave Act (\u201cFMLA\u201d) leave\nbut on several occasions was absent from work and did not follow company\nprotocol for requesting FMLA leave. He suffered several weeks of disciplinary\nunpaid layoff. He sued GM for FMLA interference and retaliation and for\ndisability discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d)\nand the Texas Commission on Human Rights Act (\u201cTCHRA\u201d). The district\ncourt entered summary judgment for GM. We AFFIRM, principally because\nthe FMLA and accompanying regulations require employees to follow their\n\f    Case: 16-11174    Document: 00513946985     Page: 2   Date Filed: 04/10/2017\n\n\n\n                                 No. 16-11174\nemployer\u2019s \u201cusual and customary\u201d procedures for requesting FMLA leave\nabsent \u201cunusual circumstances,\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.303(c).\n                              BACKGROUND\n      Acker began working for GM in the fall of 2000 at its automobile plant\nin Kokomo, Indiana. In summer 2014, he voluntarily transferred to the GM\nassembly plant in Arlington, Texas. He is an electrician who typically works\nthird shift. Acker suffers from acute iron-deficiency anemia that sometimes\ncauses him to experience blackouts, grayouts, heart palpitations, and fatigue.\nAs a consequence, Acker was certified for intermittent medical leave under the\nFMLA by his physician.\n      GM has a detailed attendance policy.          The product of collective\nbargaining between GM and the International Union, United Automobile,\nAerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America, this attendance\npolicy is codified in what is known as \u201cDocument No. 8\u2014Memorandum of\nUnderstanding\u2014Special Procedure for Attendance\u201d (\u201cDoc. 8\u201d). As a current\nelectrician covered by the collective bargaining agreement, Acker is subject to\nDoc. 8.\n      For an unplanned absence, the collective bargaining agreement simply\nrequires employees to notify GM at least thirty minutes before the shift starts.\nFailure to call by the deadline is considered an \u201cinstance\u201d under Doc. 8, unless\nthe employee can explain the untimeliness satisfactorily to management.\nWhen absences are unexcused, GM allocates up to eight hours per instance of\nthat employee\u2019s \u201cVacation Restricted\u201d hours to each hour that the employee\nwas absent.    Under this arrangement, employees are permitted up to five\n\u201cinstances\u201d of unexcused absence before they become subject to discipline\nunder the policy. Acker testified that he understood this use of \u201cVacation\nRestricted\u201d time as a \u201cfree pass.\u201d After the \u201cfree\u201d absences are used up, Doc. 8\nimposes \u201cAttendance Improvement Steps\u201d for additional unexcused absences\n                                       2\n\f    Case: 16-11174       Document: 00513946985    Page: 3   Date Filed: 04/10/2017\n\n\n\n                                   No. 16-11174\nthrough a six-step program that moves from two written warnings to unpaid\ndisciplinary layoff to termination.\n         GM also has a policy for requesting FMLA leave.           Union benefit\nrepresentatives at each GM facility assist employees with FMLA leave\nrequests. Employees must make an initial request for FMLA leave with GM\u2019s\nBenefits & Services center, administered by third-party vendor Sedgwick\nClaims Management Services, Inc. (\u201cSedgwick\u201d). Once an employee has\nrequested intermittent FMLA leave, Sedgwick sends the employee a letter\nreiterating GM\u2019s policies for requesting and taking leave.         This policy is\ndescribed in an employee letter as follows:\n         If you have requested intermittent leave, you are required to report any\n         time taken under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), at least 30\n         minutes PRIOR to the start of your normal scheduled work shift, by\n         calling the GM Absence Call In Line [redacted] and selecting the \u201cFMLA\u201d\n         option when prompted (option #8). You are also required to call the GM\n         Benefits & Services Center at [redacted] by the end of your normally\n         scheduled work shift to report your FMLA absence. When calling, select\n         the prompt for \u201cFMLA\u201d.\n\nAcker testified that he was familiar with this procedure and received a packet\nincluding this letter.\n     By September 2014, Acker testified, he had used all of his \u201cfree pass\u201d\ndays. In mid-November 2014, Acker contacted Sedgwick to request FMLA\nleave.     Acker received instruction from Sedgwick to obtain a medical\ncertification by November 28, and he complied. On December 9, Sedgwick\nnotified him that he was approved for intermittent FMLA leave from\nNovember 11, 2014 to May 11, 2015.            Nevertheless, he began receiving\ndiscipline for several unapproved absences according to GM\u2019s procedures.\n         The record is undisputed concerning the disciplinary procedure GM\nfollowed and the facts underlying the discipline. Acker was absent from work\non September 29 and received his first written disciplinary warning under Doc.\n                                         3\n\f    Case: 16-11174    Document: 00513946985    Page: 4    Date Filed: 04/10/2017\n\n\n\n                                No. 16-11174\n8 on October 7. Acker testified that he did not request FMLA leave for the\nSeptember 29 absence. Acker was absent a month later, on October 30, and\nwas disciplined with a second written warning a day later. Acker testified that\nhe did not request FMLA leave for this absence, either.\n      Acker was absent again November 12, 13, and 14, which were counted\nas two \u201cinstances\u201d of unexcused absence under GM\u2019s policy. Combined with\nthe first two unexcused absences, Acker became subject to two weeks\u2019 unpaid\nsuspension as a disciplinary layoff.   Acker contacted Sedgwick to request\nFMLA leave for the November 12 and 13 absences, and his request was\napproved by Sedgwick. When GM was made aware of this approval, GM\nrescinded its disciplinary action for November 12 and 13. However, Acker\ntestified that, for the November 14 absence, he failed to call in 30 minutes\nbefore his shift began and missed the FMLA absence call-in time by over an\nhour. For this November 14 default, GM treated the first week of the earlier\ndisciplinary layoff, which Acker had already undergone, as discipline pursuant\nto Doc. 8.\n      Acker was also absent on November 22 and 23. Phone records produced\nby Acker confirm that none of his three calls to the GM shift absence line were\ntimely. Acker was issued another disciplinary layoff with two weeks of unpaid\nsuspension for these unexcused absences, in line with the Doc. 8 policy of\nprogressive discipline.\n      Acker was absent again on December 6, 7, and 8.          His absence for\nDecember 7 was approved because Acker timely called both the GM absence\nline and the GM Benefits & Services line. While Acker did contact the GM\nabsence line for December 6 and December 8, he failed to contact the Benefits\n& Services line in time on both occasions. Thus on January 14, 2015, Acker\nwas denied FMLA coverage for both days and issued a disciplinary layoff under\nGM policy, this time a 30 day unpaid suspension. Although the Doc. 8 policy\n                                       4\n\f    Case: 16-11174     Document: 00513946985     Page: 5   Date Filed: 04/10/2017\n\n\n\n                                  No. 16-11174\nrequired Acker\u2019s termination for these additional unexcused absences, GM\nretained him with an opportunity to correct his attendance issues. The last\ndisciplinary action GM had to take with respect to Acker\u2019s attendance was on\nJanuary 14.\n      Since February 2015, Acker testified, he has taken more than 30 days of\nintermittent FMLA leave and managed to timely call the GM Absence and\nBenefits & Services lines according to the collective bargaining agreement.\nNevertheless, Acker filed suit against GM in September 2015 for damages\nconcerning the unpaid suspensions. After discovery, GM moved for and was\ngranted summary judgment by the district court. Acker timely appealed.\n                          STANDARD OF REVIEW\n      \u201cSummary judgment is required \u2018if the movant shows that there is no\ngenuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment\nas a matter of law.\u2019\u201d Lawrence v. Fed. Home Loan Mortg. Corp., 808 F.3d 670,\n673 (5th Cir. 2015) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a)). Summary judgment cannot\nbe defeated through \u201c[c]onclusional allegations and denials, speculation,\nimprobable     inferences,   unsubstantiated      assertions,    and    legalistic\nargumentation.\u201d Oliver v. Scott, 276 F.3d 736, 744 (5th Cir. 2002).\n                                 DISCUSSION\n      Acker raises three issues on appeal. First, regarding his FMLA\ninterference claim, he contends that his calls to GM and the Benefits &\nServices lines were sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to\nwhether he provided reasonable notice of his need for unplanned FMLA leave.\nSecond, he claims that the disciplinary layoffs were in retaliation for exercising\nhis FMLA rights. Third, he argues that his request for FMLA leave was also\na request for a reasonable accommodation for a disability under the ADA and\nTCHRA, and that the disciplinary layoffs thus also constituted disability\ndiscrimination.\n                                        5\n\f    Case: 16-11174     Document: 00513946985     Page: 6   Date Filed: 04/10/2017\n\n\n\n                                  No. 16-11174\n      A. FMLA Interference\n      To prove an interference claim, a plaintiff \u201cmust at least show that [the\ndefendant] interfered with, restrained, or denied [his] exercise or attempt to\nexercise FMLA rights, and that the violation prejudiced [him].\u201d Bryant v. Tex.\nDep\u2019t of Aging & Disability Servs., 781 F.3d 764, 770 (5th Cir. 2015) (quoting\nCuellar v. Keppel Amfels, L.L.C., 731 F.3d 342, 347 (5th Cir. 2013)).         An\n\u201cinterference claim merely requires proof that the employer denied the\nemployee his entitlements under the FMLA.\u201d Stallings v. Hussmann Corp.,\n447 F.3d 1041, 1051 (8th Cir. 2006).\n      While the employee has a right to take leave under the FMLA, the\nemployee must give his employer notice of his intention to take leave in order\nto be entitled to it. See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2612(e)(1) (\u201cRequirement of notice\u201d); (2)\n(\u201cDuties of employee\u201d). See also 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.303. When the need for leave\nis foreseeable, the employee generally \u201cmust provide the employer at least 30\ndays advance notice before FMLA leave is to begin.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.302(a). If\n30 days\u2019 notice is not practicable, \u201cnotice must be given as soon as practicable.\u201d\nId. In all instances, \u201can employee must comply with the employer\u2019s usual and\ncustomary notice and procedural requirements for requesting leave, absent\nunusual circumstances.\u201d Id. \u00a7 825.302(d).        \u201cWhere an employee does not\ncomply with the employer\u2019s usual notice and procedural requirements, and no\nunusual circumstances justify the failure to comply, FMLA\u2013protected leave\nmay be delayed or denied.\u201d Id. This regulation \u201cexplicitly permits employers\nto condition FMLA-protected leave upon an employee\u2019s compliance with the\nemployer\u2019s usual notice and procedural requirements, absent unusual\ncircumstances.\u201d Srouder v. Dana Light Axle Mfg., LLC, 725 F.3d 608, 614 (6th\nCir. 2013).\n      Even when an employee\u2019s need for leave is unforeseeable, the regulations\nmake clear the employee\u2019s duty to comply with the employer\u2019s policy. \u201cWhen\n                                        6\n\f    Case: 16-11174    Document: 00513946985        Page: 7     Date Filed: 04/10/2017\n\n\n\n                                    No. 16-11174\nthe need for leave is not foreseeable, an employee must comply with the\nemployer\u2019s usual and customary notice and procedural requirements for\nrequesting leave, absent unusual circumstances.\u201d             29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.303(c).\n\u201c[A]n employer generally does not violate the FMLA if it terminates an\nemployee for failing to comply with a policy requiring notice of absences, even\nif the absences that the employee failed to report were protected by the FMLA.\u201d\nTwigg v. Hawker Beechcraft Corp., 659 F.3d 987, 1008\u201309 (10th Cir. 2011). See\nalso Bacon v. Hennepin Cty. Med. Ctr., 550 F.3d 711, 715 (8th Cir. 2008)\n(\u201cEmployers who enforce [call-in] policies by firing employees on FMLA leave\nfor noncompliance do not violate the FMLA.\u201d).\n      An employer may thus require that an employee hew to the employer\u2019s\nusual and customary procedures for requesting FMLA leave.                  Discipline\nresulting from the employee\u2019s failure to do so does not constitute interference\nwith the exercise of FMLA rights unless the employee can show unusual\ncircumstances. \u201cFormal notice-of-absence policies serve an employer\u2019s\nlegitimate business interests in keeping apprised of the status of its employees\nand ensuring that it has an adequate workforce to carry out its normal\noperations.\u201d Twigg, 659 F.3d at 1009; Goff v. Singing River Health Sys.,\n6 F. Supp. 3d 704, 711 (S.D. Miss. 2014) (summary judgment is appropriate in\nFMLA case without evidence of unusual circumstances excusing employee\u2019s\nfailure to call employer timely).\n      It is undisputed that Acker\u2019s phone records show he failed to call in\ntimely under GM\u2019s procedure on the dates for which he received disciplinary\nlayoff: November 14, 22, 23, and December 6 and 8. Acker cannot rely on his\ndeposition testimony, inconsistent with phone records that he described as the\n\u201cuniverse\u201d of his calls during the relevant period, to create a fact issue on\ntimeliness. Vais Arms, Inc. v. Vais, 383 F.3d 287, 294 (5th Cir. 2004) (\u201cvague,\nself-serving statements\u201d are \u201cnot sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material\n                                         7\n\f    Case: 16-11174     Document: 00513946985       Page: 8   Date Filed: 04/10/2017\n\n\n\n                                    No. 16-11174\nfact\u201d); see also Jackson v. Cal-W. Packaging Corp., 602 F.3d 374, 379 (5th Cir.\n2010). Thus, in order to establish FMLA interference, Acker has to show that\nfor each of these non-FMLA-approved absences, unusual circumstances\nprevented him from following the union-negotiated procedures. This he has\nnot done.\n      Acker testified that his disability causes him to experience severe\ndisorientation, blackouts, grayouts, heart palpitations, and extreme fatigue\nwhen in the acute phase, and that his disability can reach the acute phase\nsuddenly and could constitute a sudden medical issue or emergency.              He\noffered no factual support, however, that he reached the acute stage or\nexperienced a medical emergency on the days in question. Indeed, he testified\nthat he was too \u201cdizzy\u201d to follow GM\u2019s call-in procedure only on November 14,\nbut he was given FMLA leave and was not disciplined under Doc. 8 for that\nabsence. He did not explain why \u201cunusual circumstances\u201d left him capable of\ncalling one line, but not the other: on November 22, December 6, and December\n8, Acker timely called the GM absence line, but failed to call the GM Benefits\n& Services line. There is no proof that unusual circumstances arising from his\ncondition prevented him from complying with GM\u2019s call-in policy with respect\nto one line but not the other.\n      Relying on Saenz v. Harlingen Med. Ctr., L.P., 613 F.3d 576 (5th Cir.\n2010) as well as Millea v. Metro-North R.R. Co., 658 F.3d 154 (2d Cir. 2011),\nAcker argues that failure to comply with an employer\u2019s usual and customary\nprocedures cannot be grounds for discipline when the employee provides\n\u201creasonable\u201d notice of an unforeseen absence. He thus argues that there is a\nfact issue whether his (untimely) phone calls provided reasonable notice to GM\nirrespective of company policies.\n      Acker\u2019s reliance on these cases is misplaced. First, the holdings in each\nof those cases are predicated on outdated, materially different regulations. The\n                                         8\n\f     Case: 16-11174       Document: 00513946985         Page: 9    Date Filed: 04/10/2017\n\n\n\n                                      No. 16-11174\nSixth Circuit noted the material changes to the FMLA regulations that went\ninto effect on January 16, 2009. See Srouder, 725 F.3d 608. Based on the\nprevious regulations, the Sixth Circuit had held that the \u201cFMLA does not\npermit an employer to limit his employee\u2019s FMLA rights by denying them\nwhenever an employee fails to comply with internal procedural requirements\nthat are more strict than those contemplated by the FMLA.\u201d Id. at 613\u2013614\n(citing Cavin v. Honda of Am. Mfg., Inc., 346 F.3d 713 (6th Cir. 2003). But the\nrevised regulations explicitly allow employers to condition FMLA leave on\nfollowing the employer\u2019s policy. Srouder, 725 F.3d at 614. Indeed, this court\nin Saenz acknowledged that the post-2009 regulations, if applicable, could have\nrequired summary judgment for the employer:\n       the 2009 revisions to the FMLA regulations governing notice should not\n       apply to the instant case . . . the most salient regulatory change\u2014the\n       revisions to 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.303\u2014arguably increases the duties imposed\n       upon employees seeking FMLA leave. Were we to apply the new\n       regulations, [the employer] might very well be entitled to summary\n       judgment . . . we decline to retroactively apply the new regulations, and\n       all citations to the governing FMLA regulations refer to the pre-2009\n       Code of Federal Regulations edition.\n\nSaenz, 613 F.3d at 582 n.9. The new regulations control the standard for this\ncase, and Acker has not raised a fact issue for FMLA interference. 1\n       B. FMLA Retaliation\n       To prove FMLA retaliation, the employee must demonstrate: \u201c1) he was\nprotected under the FMLA; 2) he suffered an adverse employment action; and\n3) he was treated less favorably than an employee who had not requested leave\nunder the FMLA or the adverse decision was made because he sought\n\n\n       1 Likewise Millea involved an incident in 2006, three years before the material change\nin the regulations. See 658 F.3d at 159\u201360 (describing the relevant incident in 2006). In\naddition, that case is factually distinct because unlike here, where Acker did not follow the\ntiming requirements of his employer\u2019s FMLA request policy, the employer in Millea \u201creceived\ntimely, although indirect, notice of Millea\u2019s use of FMLA leave.\u201d Id.\n                                             9\n\f    Case: 16-11174        Document: 00513946985          Page: 10     Date Filed: 04/10/2017\n\n\n\n                                       No. 16-11174\nprotection under the FMLA.\u201d Mauder v. Metro. Transit Auth. of Harris Cty.,\nTex., 446 F.3d 574, 583 (5th Cir. 2006).               The third element requires the\nemployee to show \u201cthere is a causal link\u201d between the FMLA-protected activity\nand the adverse action. Richardson v. Monitronics Int\u2019l, Inc., 434 F.3d 327,\n332 (5th Cir. 2005).\n       Acker cannot make a prima facie case.                He has not shown how his\ndisciplinary leave was caused by his attempts to seek protection under the\nFMLA instead of his failure to follow GM\u2019s attendance and absence approval\nprocess. Acker is still employed by GM. He has taken more than 30 days of\nintermittent FMLA leave since his last disciplinary layoff by following GM\u2019s\ncall-in procedure. It is undisputed that GM\u2019s policy should have resulted in\nAcker\u2019s termination for his absence on December 6, but GM offered Acker the\nopportunity to correct his attendance problems. These undisputed facts belie\nany casual connection between his claimed adverse action and his attempt to\nseek FMLA leave.\n       C. ADA/TCHRA\n       Acker also argues that in disciplining him for violation of the Doc. 8\nprocedures, GM failed to accommodate his disability by means of FMLA leave.\nHe contends that his requests for FMLA leave, although made outside of the\nprocess GM provided, were simultaneously requests for a reasonable\naccommodation under the ADA, and concomitantly, the TCHRA. 2                            Acker\nargues that because a request for medical leave generally is a request for an\naccommodation in some instances, a request for FMLA leave is also a request\n\n\n\n\n       2 The Texas Supreme Court has held that the TCHRA can be interpreted in lockstep\nwith the federal ADA. By adopting the TCHR, \u201cthe Legislature intended to correlate state\nlaw with federal law in employment discrimination cases . . . Therefore, we look to federal\nlaw to interpret the Act\u2019s provisions.\u201d AutoZone, Inc. v. Reyes, 272 S.W.3d 588, 592 (Tex. 2008)\n(quotations and citations omitted).\n                                              10\n\f   Case: 16-11174     Document: 00513946985     Page: 11   Date Filed: 04/10/2017\n\n\n\n                                 No. 16-11174\nunder the ADA. The district court disagreed and held that Acker did not make\na request for a reasonable accommodation.\n      Employees who require accommodation due to a disability are\nresponsible for requesting a reasonable accommodation. See Griffin v. United\nParcel Serv., Inc., 661 F.3d 216 (5th Cir. 2011) (quoting E.E.O.C. v. Chevron\nPhillips Chem. Co., L.P., 570 F.3d 606, 621 (5th Cir. 2009)). However, a request\nfor FMLA leave is not a request for a reasonable accommodation under the\nADA. \u201cThe ADA and the FMLA have divergent aims, operate in different ways,\nand offer disparate relief.\u201d Navarro v. Pfizer Corp., 261 F.3d 90, 101 (1st Cir.\n2001). \u201cFMLA leave is not a reasonable accommodation under the ADA; rather\nit is a right enforceable under a separate statutory provision.\u201d Harville v. Tex.\nA&M Univ., 833 F. Supp. 2d 645, 661 (S.D. Tex. 2011) (citing Trevino v. United\nParcel Serv., No. 3:08\u2013CV\u2013889\u2013B, 2009 WL 3423039, *12 (N.D.Tex. Oct. 23,\n2009)).\n      Textual comparison of the FMLA with the ADA demonstrates why\nrequesting FMLA leave alone is not a request for an ADA reasonable\naccommodation. An employee who requests FMLA leave asserts he has a\n\u201cserious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the\nfunctions of the position of such employee.\u201d         29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2612(a)(1)(D)\n(\u201cEntitlement to leave\u201d). A request for a reasonable accommodation under the\nADA is a claim that the employee \u201cwith or without reasonable accommodation,\ncan perform the essential functions of the employment position that such\nindividual holds or desires.\u201d   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8) (\u201cDefinitions: Qualified\nIndividual\u201d). See Capps v. Mondel\u0113z Global LLC, 147 F. Supp. 3d 327, 340\u201341\n(E.D. Penn. 2015) (\u201can employee who requests leave does not clearly\ncommunicate to her employer that she is disabled and desires an\naccommodation.\u201d) (quoting Rutt v. City of Reading, Pa., No. CIV.A. 13\u20134559,\n2014 WL 5390428, *4 (E.D. Pa. Oct. 22, 2014). Thus, an employee seeking\n                                       11\n\f   Case: 16-11174    Document: 00513946985      Page: 12   Date Filed: 04/10/2017\n\n\n\n                                 No. 16-11174\nFMLA leave is by nature arguing that he cannot perform the functions of the\njob, while an employee requesting a reasonable accommodation communicates\nthat he can perform the essential functions of the job.\n      Acker has not demonstrated any dispute of material fact that his\nuntimely phone calls could have sought a reasonable accommodation under the\nADA. He failed to follow GM\u2019s absence procedure, was disciplined, and has\nsuccessfully followed GM\u2019s absence procedure since. As a consequence, Acker\nhas not proved how GM denied him any accommodation.\n                               CONCLUSION\n      For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is\nAFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                      12\n\f"
