    "text": "SEO helps improve your website\u2019s visibility in unpaid search engine rankings (also called organic results). If your website is placed higher in search engine results, you are more likely to receive increased traffic to your website. Knowledge of SEO will increase your traffic, thus bringing in readers and the potential to earn money through those readers.\nUse a contextual ad service. Once your blog contains high quality content and has begun to attract an audience, you can make money using Google Adsense, WordAds, or any other contextual ad service. These automatically generate ads in the amount, size, and placement you specify, matching the ads chosen to the topics you write about. The more readers who click on the ads shown on your site, the more money the advertisers will pay you.\nSuccess in every facet of life is based on who you know and not what you know \ud83d\ude42 The secret is to start connecting with more people, if you build your network wide enough you\u2019ll meet someone who can help you, no matter what it is that you are trying to achieve. Some meet these influential people more quickly by complete luck of the draw, others need to keep plugging along longer. The system works either way, and whether or not it works better for others is irrelevant, all systems in life work better for some than others.\n\nPS: my answer to this question is always\u2026 \u201cthe better question is\u2026 how can my blog help me build a profitable business?\u201d Most of the profits from blogging are not made on your blog, but that\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t believe blogging about making money per se, but about branding yourself and positioning yourself within your niche market as an authority and leader. Once that is established, there are so many ways to move people into your money making enterprises. Email marketing, as you pointed out, is one of the best ways to do this. Sending people to your membership sites, services, info products and coaching programs are all great things to route people into as well.\n\nJust be aware that affiliate marketing with the wrong company can damage your brand. For instance, I started my blog w/ Blue Host because of Pat Flynn\u2019s recommendation \u2013 which I am sure he was paid for. I am now on day 5 of my site, and e-mail being down, with NO estimate from Blue Host as to when it will be back up. As a consequence, I wouldn\u2019t buy a thing he suggested or endorsed, because of my experience with someone he put his seal of approval on. Blue Host has a HORRIBLE reputation among the community, and I even wonder if anyone would \u201crecommend\u201d them unless they were being paid.\n\nnice men !

Offering services from day 1 can work out for you and bring in some clients, but as your blog grows you\u2019ll find that your time is better spent making products.\n\nWrite content. I like to write an article from beginning to end with no breaks. It may take me an hour to write an article or I may be at it all day. Sometimes, content does span a few days, but for the most part, I like to finish a piece of content in one sitting. I then hand over the content to my editor to fix anything from grammar, punctuation, to the general flow of the article. The only thing she doesn't edit is my monthly income report.\n\nWrite content on your blog that is helpful and informative to people who are reading your page. By focusing on one niche, you will be able to focus your content on just one particular market and draw in an audience that is interested and devoted to that niche. You will soon learn that targeting a specific niche has a whole load of benefits that can help you out.\n\nIf you\u2019ve spent a lot of time writing that week and just need a break from working on a post, it may be a productive way to spend an hour or two but I personally think your time could be better spent elsewhere. (This isn\u2019t to say that you can\u2019t find success utilizing this method, I just don\u2019t see many/any people doing it and reporting back that it\u2019s really helped them).\nAs you can see there is no shortage of methods with regards to making money on your blog.

We are dedicated to our customers and a good customer service is very important to us.\nIf you are interested in covering a broad topic that many people already write about, create multiple specialized blogs instead and link between them when the subjects overlap. For instance, if you are a nutrition expert, write one blog about healthy weight management, another one about child nutrition, and another about growing your own vegetables.\n\nAffiliate sales comprise a large chunk of revenue for most big-name bloggers. For instance, Pat Flynn made $53K last month from affiliate sales, compared to \"just\" $9,500 from book sales. In general, look for affiliate products with higher price points; web hosting companies are a great choice if it makes sense in your niche, with payouts of anywhere from $60-$130+ per signup.\n\nMy understanding is that you have to subscribe/pay for the business version of Word Press in order to use any of the monetizing functions. I think you should clearly state this in this article at the beginning. I think there is a degree of bait and switch here if people are just signing up for the free subscription and then finding out they have to pay for a subscription to make money. I am ok with that, it just needs to be stated up front everywhere.\n\nI will quibble on one point though, your comment about BBT getting 13,000 subscribers before launching even though you \u201chad nothing but a coming soon page and an invitation to join our email list.\u201d As I recall, you also had a freakin\u2019 awesome video on that page as well that just made people yearn to give you their email address, even without knowing a thing about BBT. So that didn\u2019t hurt, either. ; )\n\nIt\u2019s always great to learn from the best (=Jon)! The idea of the Minimum Viable Funnel was a real eye-opener, I have a product idea and will definitely test with the MVF if it flies. Actually, I did it with my other blog in the past (wasn\u2019t even aware of the concept, it just happened\u2026). It saved me from a huge disappointment and effort. Only one person bought the product so there certainly was no market for that! And refunding the money to that one person didn\u2019t break the bank!\n\nThanks heaps. Really honest and helpful information and makes me want to get into making mine happen again. Time off from Uni soon so more time to devote to it. I like the point about adding something that you feel is good. What\u2019s the point in getting to where you want to go if you have to do so at someone else\u2019s expense? There\u2019s already enough of that in the world now so why add to it. Better to make yourself stand out by being someone who doesn\u2019t do that. Perhaps that\u2019s why I like your blog. By the way, I can truly say that \u201cI hate Uni too.\u201d\nOK, I\u2019m going to show my age\u2026a couple of decades ago, the public relations profession was in trouble and thoroughly misunderstood. As a profession, it lacked luster. So, the pros (me among them, though I was a cub then:) worked on a national public relations campaign for public relations. It worked. Public relations became recognized as a true profession, though there were and still are nitwits that don\u2019t get it.\nReally if you are looking forward a blog that how to make money from blogging then you have across in the right place. You will get a lot of good resources from here..Really I haven\u2019t written any blog but I have got good vibes from here.So will start very soon :). I want to tell you one thing that through this blog I learned my shortcoming and my mistakes too.Thank you for putting your great effort..!!!\n\nSome blogs are focused on getting paid to provide links to news articles, company stores, or other third party websites. The most financially successful of these range from the Drudge, a blog composed almost entirely of conservative-leaning news links, to Smashing Magazine, a site that provides advice and product reviews to help software developers.[5][6]"
