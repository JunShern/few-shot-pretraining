You can see a marker on the map, but you cannot fasttravel there.Inside the tree are two versions of the sword:1. A normal version which is slightly better than a Daedric longsword2. A flaming version with an extra fire damage enchantment (thanks to Mr V for his 'Bluefire Claymore')These swords might be a bit overpowered, but hey, it's a dragonrider's sword.NOTE: The container for the swords is a bit hidden. Search at the root of the tree.EDIT: Some people had a problem with nothing showing up when the mod was activated. Those can try the optional plugin file \"TestingHall Addition\" which adds the swords to the testinghall.
