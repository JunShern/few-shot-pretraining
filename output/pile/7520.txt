We decided to nominate John Arthorne as a committer so we at least have someone to accept community patches. We will revisit after Juno and perhaps do a larger restructuring\n\nCommunication with eGit: We have written some patches for eGit that have been growing stale. Dani will review the patches, and then send an email to eGit lead asking if there is a particular reason for not accepting them. If there is no problem with the patches we will track down an eGit committer to release them.\n\nAndrew asked about process for approving CQs:\n\nAny PMC member can feel free to approve CQs\n\nNew versions of existing third party libraries are a no-brainer, typically just +1 right away\n\nFor new third party libraries we may need a PMC discussion about why the library is needed, what feature it will live in, etc\n\nFor code contributions just make sure the legal process has been followed and then +1. We generally trust the judgement of the committer who will process the contribution.\n\nFebruary 15, 2012: - Dani, McQ, John\n\nSome discussion of what to do with PDE Build, which lacks committers. PDE as a whole has barely enough committers to be a functioning project, so maybe we should be looking at a larger restructuring after\n\nJuno rather than one piece at a time. We lacked quorum to make a decision so we will defer discussion to another week."
