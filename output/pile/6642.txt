This is intuitive and useful because it's consistent with the regular \"prefix\" Tab completion.\nBut my Ubuntu servers and desktops behave differently: even when it would expand to more than one entry, Tab replaces the pattern with the first entry.\nI have checked the usual suspects (/etc/bash.bashrc, /etc/inputrc, and the local versions) and I couldn't find any difference.\nDoes anybody know which setting controls this behaviour?\n\nA:\n\nContrary the other answer, this particular problem is probably a direct result of using bash-completion. The bash-completion package has several bugs (as noted in this U&L answer about a similar problem, for instance).\nIf I comment out this section in my .bashrc:\n# enable programmable completion features (you don't need to enable\n# this, if it's already enabled in /etc/bash.bashrc and /etc/profile\n# sources /etc/bash.bashrc).\nif ! shopt -oq posix; then\n  if [ -f /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion ]; then\n    . /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion\n  elif [ -f /etc/bash_completion ]; then\n    . /etc/bash_completion\n  fi\nfi\n\nand start a new instance of bash, then I get:\n$ echo *o*<tab><tab>\nfoo     food    foo.sh  \n$ echo *o*\n\nAnd then if I source the /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion script like it was in the .bashrc:\n$ . /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion\n$ echo foo\n\nThe *o* was immediately autocompleted to foo without showing the other matches.\nI'm using 16.04, by the way. I don't know if this has been fixed in newer releases.\n$ dpkg-query --show --showformat='${Package} ${version}\\n' bash bash-completion\nbash 4.3-14ubuntu1.2\nbash-completion 1:2.1-4.2ubuntu1.1\n\n"
