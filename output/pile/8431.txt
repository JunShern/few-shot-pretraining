    "text": "Well-known Jewish dissident Professor Shlomo Sand has admitted that Israel is the \u201cmost racist state in the world\u201d\u2014and that Jews in the rest of the world all work to \u201cdominate\u201d and \u201ccontrol\u201d their home nations\u2019 policies to support the racist Zionist state.\n\nThe astonishing outburst by Professor Sand\u2014who first gained fame for propagating the now-discredited \u201cKhazar\u201d-origin theory of Ashkenazi Jews\u2014is contained in his new book How I stopped being a Jew.\n\nIn his new book, Sand, who was raised in Israel, discusses what he called the \u201cnegative effects of the Israeli exploitation of the chosen people myth\u201d and what he calls its \u201cholocaust industry.\u201d\n\nHe also rejects the Jewish religion for its \u201cgenocidal Yahwestic tradition,\u201d\u2014a reference to that religion\u2019s \u201choly books\u201d which contain direct instructions to Jews from God which justify, quite literally, the murder and dispossession of Gentiles.\n\nIn an article in the UK\u2019s Guardian newspaper discussing his new book, Sand went on:\n\nI am aware of living in one of the most racist societies in the western world. Racism is present to some degree everywhere, but in Israel it exists deep within the spirit of the laws. It is taught in schools and colleges, spread in the media, and above all and most dreadful, in Israel the racists do not know what they are doing and, because of this, feel in no way obliged to apologise.\n\nI am often even ashamed of Israel, particularly when I witness evidence of its cruel military colonisation, with its weak and defenceless victims who are not part of the \u201cchosen people\u201d.\n\nDeeper inside his book itself, Sand makes the following observation on how Jews in the Diaspora now use their position to \u201cdominate\u201d and \u201ccontrol\u201d their host nations:\n\nSince the fall of the Soviet Union, there is no longer a country in the world where the descendants of the chosen people are prevented from emigrating to the state of the Jews. Zionism has shifted the objective that originally constituted its raison d\u2019\u00eatre and acquired a second youth through a reinvigorating initiative.\n\nNow more than ever, those who aspire to identify themselves with the seed of Abraham are asked to gather funds in support of a land of the Jews that is in full territorial expansion and, above all, to activate all their networks of influence on their country\u2019s foreign policy and public opinion.\n\nThe results of the latter objective have been remarkable.\n\nAt a time when communitarianism enjoys growing legitimacy \u2014 particularly in an age of reverence for \u2018Judeo-Christian\u2019 civilization, underpinning the \u2018clash of civilizations\u2019 \u2014 it is more possible than ever to harbour pride at being a Jew and finding oneself on the side of the powerful who dominate history.\n\nWhile Sand is approaching the entire topic from what would traditionally be regarded as a \u201cfar leftist\u201d position\u2014and his demonstrably false belief that there is no genetic basis to Judaism\u2014his observations about the true nature of Jewish racist tribalism are accurate.\n\nWhere Sand has made his essential mistake is understanding that all human behavior has in fact a biological origin. All of us\u2014of whatever ethnic origin\u2014are merely products of our ancestors. Our abilities, our limitations, and our innate characters\u2014are all inherited from those who have come before.\n\nSand\u2019s realization that the vast majority of his fellow Jews are ultra-racists\u2014and hypocrites as well\u2014must be difficult enough for him to comprehend. It might then be too much to expect him to admit that there is an inherited aspect to Jewish behavior which perpetuates this open racism towards, and hatred of, Gentiles from generation to generation.\n\nSand\u2019s new book has already attracted the ire of some of his erstwhile fellow Jews.\n\nThe Jewish journalist Gordon Haber, in an article in The Jewish Daily Forward, for example, dismissed Sands as a \u201ccrackpot\u201d\u2014yet was forced to admit that Sands had correctly identified one aspect of Jewish behavior which even Haber found puzzling: namely the staggering hypocrisy of Jews in America supporting Israeli racism while propagating exactly the opposite policy in the US.\n\nHaber wrote:\n\nAnd yet, if I am to be honest, Sand does raise a question of grave importance. For Sand, there is a \u201cclose link\u201d between an essentialist Jewish identity and how Israel treats its non-Jews. Many, of course, will argue that Israel is a haven for Muslims and everything\u2019s hunky-dory in Gaza.\n\nBut those of us who strive for intellectual honesty must acknowledge the contradiction between Western ideals and an ethno-religious government that humiliates and brutalizes people under its jurisdiction. American Jews, in particular, need to ask themselves why they support a situation in Israel that they would never countenance in their own country.\n\nOf course, neither Sand nor Haber will dare tackle the real reason for this obvious hypocrisy\u2014which is that Jewish racial tribalism engages in a divide-and-conquer strategy to ensure that non-Jews remain divided and deflected away from the real source of power in the US and elsewhere: the Jewish Lobby."
