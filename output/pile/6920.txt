    "text": "No author I ever heard of has ever gotten offended by readers wanting \u2018moar\u2019, and I\u2019m no exception. The explosion of the \u201cFire From the Sky\u201d series left me stunned, though in a happy way, and readers clamoring for more is what every author dreams of. Again, I am no exception.\n\nLet me pause here to say \u201cthank you!\u201d to everyone of you, too. It is an honor to be ranked so high on Amazon\u2019s author list, and I owe every bit of that to those of you who have read my books. I am beyond words to describe how exciting it is, or how much it tickles me to hear that you have enjoyed the fruits of my labor.\n\nAnd it\u2019s perhaps the ultimate compliment for readers to immediately demand more. I simply don\u2019t know what could be better than that.\n\nIn the last few weeks I\u2019ve had questions about Parno, Stormcrow and of course \u201cFire\u201d, and when they could expect the next of whichever series they were interested in. Why this book was first, or second, or wherever it fell in the order.\n\nFirst of all, I usually work on more than one project at a time, which is why I sometimes have books of different series released so close together. When I am stuck on one I just move over to another and keep going and so forth, back and forth until they\u2019re finished. So I\u2019m always working on something unless I\u2019m taking a break, (which I do about three times a year for no more than one week, mostly to recharge my batteries if you will).\n\nFire From the Sky and its follow on novels run about 70-100k at the moment. They have clearly drawn lines and the characters are generally a straightforward group at this point which eases the dialogue challenge a little. As the story grows I expect that to change, with complexity rising as it does, and the length of the books as well, in all likelihood.\n\nStormcrow novels run anywhere from 90-130k words, give or take, and while those novels are complicated and tangled, the main cast of characters, complex though they are, is small and pretty manageable. Dialogue and movement isn\u2019t terribly complicated to put together once I\u2019ve gotten the plot and scenes sketched out.\n\nParno has become a monster in both scope, size, number of characters and the complexity of those characters. The story has grown from an original three books to now a minimum of five and more likely six or seven. I still have no idea how that happened other than the story wouldn\u2019t do what I told it. That sounds ludicrous I know but. . .it\u2019s amazing what characters you invent decide to do once you start writing. It doesn\u2019t matter how long you\u2019ve had something planned or how well, once you start putting it down, it\u2019s almost guaranteed to change.\n\nAnd Parno novels at a minimum weigh in at 150k words and every time I end one I know I could have kept going. At some point though I have to start thinking about what the print version will be like and stop.\n\nAnd this is why some books are faster than others, at least for me. I\u2019m not really familiar with how anyone else does their planning so I may be the odd one out, or I may just be doing the same thing as everyone else in this line of work, I don\u2019t know. My point though is that in the time it takes me to write the next Parno novel, I may very well have been able to write two \u2018Fire\u2019 novels and a Stormcrow novel as well. Parno novels are vastly more complicated and have way more moving parts, which slows me down. I like to think it\u2019s worth it and that it makes the Parno series better for it, but it still takes time to put that many wheels into one gear box.\n\nIn the time it takes to write the next Stormcrow novel, I still might hammer out two \u201cFire\u201d novels, again just because the tangled plot of Stormcrow takes longer to work.\n\nSo no, I don\u2019t favor one series over the other. I write wherever the inspiration is for that day. Every book has an outline (more like a map, really) so I can pick up where I left off with little to no problem. And I usually write a little bit every day on everything I\u2019m working on at the moment, unless I\u2019m really on a hot streak with one in which case I\u2019ll ride that streak out until I collapse from exhaustion, \ud83d\ude00\n\nSo the order of books being finished isn\u2019t a result of my liking one series over another, but simply the fact that each one is so different. They each have their challenges, their advantages, and their drawbacks. Some are easier, some are harder, some are a mix of both.\n\nFor those waiting on the next installment of Parno, I\u2019m looking at a Spring release, which I managed to do this year with \u201cGambit\u201d. One a year in that series is about what I\u2019m going to average I think, and I doubt that would go faster even if it was all I worked on. I would still have times when I couldn\u2019t move the plot along and instead of letting that be idle time, I just work on something else.\n\nFor Stormcrow, it may or may not precede the next Parno (tentatively entitled \u2018Parno\u2019s Peril\u2019, btw) but I also hope to have it released by Spring, if not sooner.\n\nThe next \u2018Fire\u2019 novel may well be released around Christmas time.\n\nRemember that all of this is assuming the Lord wills I live so long to get all this done. I do hope that he does of course, but I never take the Lord for granted. He will do as He will.\n\nI hope this helps explain what I know seems to be a complicated system. And it\u2019s just as rough on the proof readers too. Imagine you\u2019re editing the next \u2018Stormcrow\u2019 and you suddenly read how Parno is working on the engine of the Celia. Or in \u2018Peril\u2019 you read that Clayton has decided to lead a cavalry charge against the Imperial Army. Or Galen working to protect his family farm.\n\nYeah, that happens. \ud83d\ude00\n\nLet me throw in a special thanks to my wife, as well as Creative Text, my publishers, for all the editing and proofing they do. The thing is, I actually spell really well. What I don\u2019t always do well is type. And I am terrible at catching mistakes. I suffer from a malady that affects many readers in that if I\u2019m already expecting to find something in print, (say because I wrote it, perhaps \ud83d\ude09 ), then I\u2019ll read it whether it\u2019s there or not. That doesn\u2019t happen all the time, but it does happen enough that I miss many errors.\n\nSo thank you honey (da wife) and Dan (da publisher) for the great work you do cleaning up my messes.\n\nAnd thank all of you again for helping me make it to \u2018bestseller\u2019 status on Amazon. I will do my utmost to continue measuring up to your expectations, and showing my appreciation for your patronage and your support, as well as your encouragement!\n\nMy newest novel, Fire From the Sky, is now available on Amazon. This is the first book in a new Post Apocalyptic series I have been developing for a while now. At this point the series is open ended as I try and come up with as many torments as possible for the protagonists in the series \ud83d\ude00 (insert evil/sinister laugh here)\n\nANYway, here\u2019s a link where it can be found. If PAW is your thing then I hope it\u2019s worth checking out and you enjoy it.\n\nI have now sent the first volume of my new Post Apoc series \u201cFire From the Sky\u201d to the publishers. Fire From the Sky is a contemporary story set in the present (well, now it\u2019s the near past, to be honest) and focusing on one family and their friends as they try to survive in a world gone wrong.\n\nUNLIKE Odd Billy Todd and Roland, this book is intended to be the start of a series, so there will be questions that don\u2019t get answers here, probably, and there will be things and people that you may not see again until Book 3 or 4. It is meant to be an ongoing story and at the moment is open ended. I guess as long as I can make the story interesting, I\u2019ll keep writing.\n\nAs soon as I know the release date, I\u2019ll post it here and on Facebook.\n\nI have to give a big thanks to my readers as Parno\u2019s Gambit has done well so far. I can\u2019t tell you how exciting it is to know that people are enjoying a story that you put together and wrote basically from scratch. I really appreciate all of you who had taken the time to write and let me know you enjoyed it. As I\u2019ve said before, some nights, when I really wanted to throw my hands up and say \u201cI quit\u201d, that encouragement from you is what kept me working.\n\nParno\u2019s Gambit, Book III in the Black Sheep of Soulan, will hit the market March 10! Featured here is the dust jacket image for the hardcover edition (YAY) and the blurb from that back cover;\n\nHis father murdered by his insane sister. His older brother in exile for attempting a coup against the Crown. His oldest brother very nearly dead at the hands of the same sister and now on the throne only by the grace of a skilled surgeon who wanted to see the man she hoped to marry.\n\nAll in all, Parno McLeod\u2019s family troubles have gone from bad to worse of late. And if that wasn\u2019t enough for the young Marshal of the Army, he\u2019s also facing an army that outnumbers his almost three-to-one, fighting on two fronts and stretched thin in numbers, equipment and supplies.\n\nAdd to that now an insane sibling controlling an elite regiment of Soulan cavalry and heading south to free her traitorous twin in hopes of putting him on the throne, a flood of refugees from the war torn area of the invasion path of the Norland Imperial Army, spies and saboteurs in their midst, and a sudden startling revelation that despite his successes so far, he is as close to losing the war as he has been since it began.\n\nIt\u2019s enough to give anyone a headache.\n\nAs Parno struggles to adapt to his new position of importance after so many years of being ignored, he likewise struggles to prevent the enemy from driving any deeper into his Kingdom\u2019s territory and with getting \u2018reluctant\u2019 bureaucrats to help him by simply doing their jobs correctly in the King\u2019s name!\n\nParno has been fortunate, and he is a gifted leader for one so young, but he is young, and inexperienced. He has a plan that will save his people, but he\u2019s about to learn a very important lesson; no plan survives contact with the enemy.\n\nGambling with his people\u2019s freedom, Parno tries to do too much, too soon, and with too few men. A gambit that he admits is dangerous, and may yet see the capitol of Soulan in flames!\n\nI know it\u2019s been a long road to book Three, but I hope you find it has been worth the wait.\n\nThank you all so much!\n\nEDITED TO ADD: Just got an update, and Gambit is available for pre-order HERE!\n\nWow. I had no idea how long I had gone without an entry of any kind. I have been busy as a beaver in a rain forest, and as a result I\u2019ve not posted a single thing for almost a month. Sorry about that.\n\nI\u2019ve been working on my house, which is always fun times, and I\u2019ve been under the weather as well. Throw in a wedding, a revival, Halloween, and the same personal problems that we all have to deal with over the course of our lives, and you get a picture of why it\u2019s been so long between updates.\n\nI\u2019ve finished the short story \u201cMonster of Creasy\u2019s Hollow\u201d, the first chapter of which is posted here as \u201cTerror of Creasy\u2019s Hollow\u201d. It\u2019s still got to make it through the editing process, but as soon as it does, it will go up on Amazon.\n\nAnother novel, Roland, has finished the editing stage, and now has to go through the final read and then formatting. Billy had a lot of formatting issues, and I\u2019m trying to keep that from happening with Roland. I\u2019m also trying to work on the formatting problems Billy has, but at 800 pages, it takes a long time.\n\nMeanwhile, I\u2019ve got another novel already complete, with a sequel underway as well, which now must go through the editor. Once it has, it will start it\u2019s way toward being published as well. I\u2019m talking about Parno\u2019s Company of course. I know, I know, I keep saying that, but I\u2019m learning that editing and proof reading take far longer than I thought at first. I do all that I can, but since I\u2019m the writer, I far too often see what I want to see, and miss the mistakes that I\u2019ve made. I\u2019m told that\u2019s a common problem among writers. I know it is for me, as I\u2019ve learned to my chagrin.\n\nIn other news, I\u2019ve been prevailed upon, ( is that an actual phrase or did I make that up?) to make the Bonespear Tales into a novel, or at least a short novel, and publish it. I resisted that idea for a long time because I started Bonespear on a whim, and I\u2019ve only been adding to it when I had the time and urge to work on it. It was supposed to just be a fun way to blow off steam. But, it\u2019s proven very popular so far, and I do kinda like old Kalef, sooooo, as soon as I can, it will get the full treatment as well. Possibly before Christmas, but Christmas is coming up waaay faster than I\u2019d planned on.\n\nToday\u2019s election day. Go vote. Let your voice be heard.\n\nI hope all of you had a safe Halloween. Thank you, as always, to those of you who like my work, and let me know it. It means a great deal, I promise you.\n\nFull Disclosure?\n\nI've seen a lot of people who review books and what not posting information about the fact that they receive books from people for free in order to review them. Apparently that's in compliance with some sort of law, or legal action.\nI have occasionally posted reviews here on this blog, as anyone who reads it knows. I'm not a professional reviewer, or even really an amateur. I just like to read, and then share what I've read. That's all.\nEvery book I've ever posted a review for on this blog, I bought. Period. No one paid me or anything else. I just wanted to share my thoughts.\nSo with no idea whether I needed to state this or not, here ya go.\nNC\n\nI am a freelance Photographer born and raised in the Southeast. I have uprooted my life in Macon Georgia for a new life as an unlikely cowgirl in love with a handsome cowboy in Wyoming. I hope you enjoy my photo journal on life, love, and the spirit of Wyoming."
