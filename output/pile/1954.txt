Campbell and Judge James B. Morse Jr. joined.\n\n\nC R U Z, Judge:\n\n\u00b61             Randa Driver appeals from the grant of summary judgment\nin favor of the Arizona Department of Revenue (the \u201cDepartment\u201d) finding\nDriver liable for luxury and use tax on the cigarettes she purchased over a\nthree-year period. For the following reasons, we affirm.\n\n                  FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n\u00b62             Between January 1, 2007 and November 30, 2009 (the\n\u201cAssessment Period\u201d), Driver purchased cigarettes from Chavez, Inc.\n(\u201cChavez\u201d), a company that sold cigarettes by phone and over the Internet.\nIn 2010, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (\u201cATF\u201d)\ninvestigated Chavez for the unlawful diversion of tobacco products.\nChavez pled guilty to wire fraud and admitted to running \u201can illegal retail\ncigarette trafficking business\u201d and selling unstamped cigarettes on which\nno tax was paid.\n\n\u00b63             During the investigation, ATF identified the Arizona\ncustomers to whom Chavez had sold and shipped cigarettes and provided\ntheir names and purchase information to the Department. Using that\ninformation, the Department issued Driver a Notice of Proposed\nAssessment (\u201cNotice\u201d) reflecting that she owed $4,473.89 in luxury and use\ntax, plus interest.\n\n\u00b64           Driver protested the assessment. At a hearing before the\nOffice of Administrative Hearings, the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d)\ndeducted five invoices from the assessment, concluding that Driver\u2019s sister\nhad made those purchases, but upheld the remaining assessment. Driver\nappealed the ALJ\u2019s decision to the Department Director, who affirmed. She\nthen appealed to the Board of Tax Appeals (\u201cBOTA\u201d), who also affirmed.\n\n\u00b65          After exhausting her administrative remedies, Driver\nappealed to tax court. The parties filed cross-motions for summary\njudgment. The court granted the Department\u2019s motion and denied\nDriver\u2019s. After entry of final judgment, Driver appealed. We have\n\n\n                                    2\n\f                             DRIVER v. ADOR\n                            Decision of the Court\n\njurisdiction pursuant to Arizona Revised Statutes (\u201cA.R.S.\u201d) section 12-\n2101(A)(1) (2019).\n\n                                DISCUSSION\n\n\u00b66             We review the tax court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo.\nSee Wilderness World, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Revenue State of Ariz., 182 Ariz. 196, 198\n(1995). In doing so, we view the facts in the light most favorable to Driver,\nthe party against whom judgment was entered. See Valencia Energy Co. v.\nAriz. Dep\u2019t of Revenue, 191 Ariz. 565, 568, \u00b6 2 (1998).\n\nI.     Luxury and Use Tax\n\n\u00b67            Driver first argues the tax court erred in granting summary\njudgment because Chavez \u201clegally owed all taxes on cigarettes sold into\nthis state\u201d and, therefore, Driver is not liable for the tax.\n\n\u00b68            Arizona imposes a luxury privilege tax on all cigarette\npurchases. See A.R.S. \u00a7 42-3051 (2019). Under Arizona law, cigarettes\ncannot be sold unless the luxury tax has been paid and an official tax stamp\nis affixed. See A.R.S. \u00a7 42-3452 (2019), formerly A.R.S. \u00a7 42-3202 (2006). A\ntax stamp is evidence that luxury tax was paid, and the law presumes that\nunstamped cigarettes \u201care intended for first sale by the person and are\nsubject to the taxes imposed by this chapter.\u201d A.R.S. \u00a7 42-3453 (2019),\nformerly A.R.S. \u00a7 42-3202.01 (2006); see also A.R.S. \u00a7 42-3452 (2019), formerly\nA.R.S. \u00a7 42-3202 (2006). \u201cFirst sale\u201d means either \u201cthe initial sale or\ndistribution in intrastate commerce\u201d or \u201cthe initial use or consumption of\ncigarettes.\u201d A.R.S. \u00a7 42-3001(10) (2019), formerly A.R.S. \u00a7 42-3001(12) (2006).\n\n\u00b69            Current Arizona law prohibits the purchase of cigarettes by\ntelephone, Internet, or mail. See A.R.S. \u00a7 36-798.06 (2019); 2012 Ariz. Sess.\nLaws, ch. 311, \u00a7 2 (2nd Reg. Sess.). Under current law, an individual cannot\npossess unstamped cigarettes unless that person is a licensed cigarette\nmanufacturer, importer or distributor, or has a proper bill of lading. See\nA.R.S. \u00a7 42-3457(A) (2019). During the Assessment Period, however, phone\nand Internet cigarette sales were permitted and were governed by the\n\u201cDelivery Sales\u201d statutes. See A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 42-3221 to -3230 (2006), repealed by\n2012 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 3, \u00a7 20 (2nd Reg. Sess.).\n\n\u00b610          At the time Driver was purchasing cigarettes from Chavez, an\nindividual could possess unstamped cigarettes for his or her own use and\nconsumption if the person complied with certain requirements. See A.R.S.\n\u00a7 42-3205(A) (2006). To legally possess unstamped cigarettes, the\nindividual had to register with the Department \u201con a form and in a manner\n\n\n                                       3\n\f                             DRIVER v. ADOR\n                            Decision of the Court\n\nprescribed\u201d by the Department and remit luxury tax within ten days after\nreceipt of the unstamped cigarettes. See A.R.S. \u00a7 42-3201(C) (2006). The\nprescribed registration form was Arizona Form 800DS, entitled the\n\u201cCigarette Tax Return\u201d required for \u201cunstamped cigarettes imported into\nArizona.\u201d\n\n\u00b611          Driver purchased cigarettes from Chavez for her own use or\nconsumption in Arizona. No tax was paid on those cigarettes. Although\nrequired under law to file a Form 800DS and remit taxes to the Department,\nDriver did neither. Therefore, she is liable for the unpaid luxury tax.\n\n\u00b612             In addition to luxury tax, Arizona also imposes a tax on the\nuse or consumption of tangible personal property purchased from an out-\nof-state retailer. See A.R.S. \u00a7 42-5155(A) (2019). A purchaser is personally\nliable for use tax. See A.R.S. \u00a7 42-5155(F) (2019), formerly A.R.S. \u00a7 42-5155(E)\n(2006). This court has previously explained the distinction between the\ntransaction privilege tax and the use tax: \u201cIn contrast to the transaction\nprivilege tax, which is imposed on transactions consummated within\nArizona, a use tax is designed to reach out-of-state sales of tangible personal\nproperty to Arizona purchasers.\u201d See Ariz. Elec. Power Coop., Inc. v. Ariz.\nDep\u2019t of Revenue, 242 Ariz. 85, 87, \u00b6 7 (App. 2017).\n\n\u00b613         The record reflects that, over the course of three years, Driver\npurchased cigarettes from Chavez, an out-of-state retailer, and used or\nconsumed the cigarettes in Arizona. Thus, Driver is liable for use tax.\n\n\u00b614            Driver\u2019s complaint alleged that \u201c[t]he remote tobacco seller\n[Chavez], NOT the buyer, was legally required to collect and remit all\nArizona taxes owed at the time of taking the internet order.\u201d Driver is\ncorrect that under the Delivery Sales statutes, \u201c[e]ach person accepting a\npurchase order for a delivery sale\u201d was required to \u201ccollect and remit to the\n[D]epartment all taxes imposed on tobacco products by this state.\u201d A.R.S.\n\u00a7 42-3227 (2006). Chavez failed to comply with the Delivery Sales statutes.\nIts failure, however, does not relieve Driver of tax liability. As a purchaser\nof unstamped cigarettes, Driver was still liable for payment of luxury and\nuse tax. See A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 42-3201(C) (2006); -5155 (2006).\n\n\u00b615            Because the tax court properly determined that Driver was\nliable for luxury and use tax on her cigarette purchases, we affirm the entry\nof summary judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                       4\n\f                             DRIVER v. ADOR\n                            Decision of the Court\n\nII.    Statute of Limitations\n\n\u00b616            Driver next argues the assessment is barred by the four-year\nstatute of limitations set forth in \u00a7 42-1104. This statute authorizes the\nDepartment to make a deficiency assessment within four years after a\nreturn is either filed or required to be filed, whichever date comes later. See\nA.R.S. \u00a7 42-1104(A) (2019). The assessment here reached back more than\nfour years.\n\n\u00b617           Section 42-1104(B), however, provides exceptions to the four-\nyear limitation period and authorizes the Department to assess a tax\ndeficiency \u201cat any time\u201d if the taxpayer fails to file a return. See A.R.S. \u00a7 42-\n1104(B)(1)(b) (2019). We review the application of \u00a7 42-1104 de novo. See\nAder v. Estate of Felger, 240 Ariz. 32, 36, \u00b6 9 (App. 2016) (applying de novo\nreview to the interpretation of statutory time limitations).\n\n\u00b618           Driver does not contend that she filed a Form 800DS, the\ncigarette tax return. Therefore, the Department\u2019s assessment falls within\nthe exception to the four-year statute of limitations applying when a\ntaxpayer fails to file a return. See A.R.S. \u00a7 42-1104(B)(1)(b) (2019). Because\nthe Department\u2019s assessment is not time barred, we affirm the entry of\nsummary judgment.\n\nIII.   Due Process of Law\n\n\u00b619           Finally, Driver argues that the tax court deprived her of due\nprocess of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United\nStates Constitution. This court reviews Driver\u2019s constitutional claim de\nnovo. See In re Estate of Snure, 234 Ariz. 203, 204, \u00b6 5 (App. 2014).\n\n\u00b620           \u201cDue process requires notice and an opportunity to be heard\nat a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.\u201d Huck v. Haralambie, 122\nAriz. 63, 65 (1979). The Department provided Driver with the Notice, as\nrequired by law, and she had an opportunity to be heard in the\nadministrative proceedings. Driver protested the Notice in a hearing before\nthe Office of Administrative Hearings, where the ALJ reduced the amount\nof the assessment. Driver then appealed the ALJ\u2019s decision to the\nDepartment Director. After the Director affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision, Driver\nappealed to the BOTA where she was given a second hearing. From there,\nshe appealed to tax court. Driver was provided notice and ample\nopportunity to be heard.\n\n\u00b621           Driver also argues that \u201cthe opportunity to defend on statute\nof limitations grounds is a vested right protected by due process.\u201d As the\n\n\n                                       5\n\f                              DRIVER v. ADOR\n                             Decision of the Court\n\nUnited States Supreme Court has explained, however, the right to shelter\nfrom a statute of limitations is not a \u201cfundamental\u201d or \u201cnatural right.\u201d See\nChase Sec. Corp. v. Donaldson, 325 U.S. 304, 314 (1945).\n\n       Statutes of limitation find their justification in necessity and\n       convenience rather than in logic. They represent expedients,\n       rather than principles. They are practical and pragmatic\n       devices to spare the courts from litigation of stale claims, and\n       the citizen from being put to his defense after memories have\n       faded, witnesses have died or disappeared, and evidence has\n       been lost. . . . Their shelter has never been regarded as what\n       now is called a \u2018fundamental\u2019 right or what used to be called\n       a \u2018natural\u2019 right of the individual. He may, of course, have\n       the protection of the policy while it exists, but the history of\n       pleas of limitation shows them to be good only by legislative\n       grace and to be subject to a relatively large degree of\n       legislative control.\n\nId. (citation omitted); see also Lucia v. United States, 474 F.2d 565, 569-70 (5th\nCir. 1973) (\u201c[T]here is no substantive or fundamental right to the shelter of\na period of limitations.\u201d).\n\n\u00b622           The Arizona legislature has provided a four-year statute of\nlimitations to taxpayers but has declined to extend that protection to\ntaxpayers who fail to file their returns. See A.R.S. \u00a7 42-1104 (2019). Other\nstates have established similar limitations. See, e.g., Zignego Co., Inc. v.\nWisconsin Dep\u2019t of Revenue, 565 N.W.2d 590, 593 (Wis. Ct. App. 1997)\n(holding that \u201cif a sales and use tax return is never filed,\u201d the statute of\nlimitations \u201cnever begins to run\u201d); Dye Constr. Co. v. Dolan, 589 P.2d 497,\n498 (Colo. Ct. App. 1978) (holding that if a taxpayer fails to file a return, the\ntaxing authority is not bound by the statute of limitations).\n\n\u00b623            Driver had no fundamental right to the statutory four-year\nstatute of limitations, and there was no violation of her due process rights.\n\n\n\n\n                                        6\n\f                           DRIVER v. ADOR\n                          Decision of the Court\n\n                             CONCLUSION\n\n\u00b624          For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the tax court\u2019s decision.\nWe award costs to the Department upon compliance with Arizona Rule of\nCivil Appellate Procedure 21.\n\n\n\n\n                          AMY M.
