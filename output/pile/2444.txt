For two reasons:1) they are ancient, yet called \"highly conserved\" (fixed) by professional.They had to be in existence before the Cambrian explosion, yet remainhighly conserved to the present. One can argue from some hypothesisthat they had to evolve. And so, this is in keeping with Darwin'stheory. But where is the evidence?2) These homeobox genes are basically universal in that every animal sofar tested has the same homeobox genes: even to the extent that a mousePax6 gene was substituted in a fruit fly and the mouse gene controlledthe development of multi-phasited fly eye on the wing of this fly.There is no justification for denying the reality of the appearance ofthese genes before they were needed. These genes are extremely ancientsufficently perfect to be highly conserved (unchanged).\n\nThere may be a naturalistic explanation for this, but none come acrossas better than the opinion that homeobox genes are the product ofintelligence. I think any open mind can recognize this possibility.I do not know of any possible better evidence of Gods existence thanthese homeobox genes.\n\nThis has rendered my agnostic. I think there must be a naturalisticexplanation that better explains this than intelligence, but I'veyet to find it.\n\nPost by MarkAThose who point to a supernatural designer consistently ignore theelephant in the room: what are the properties of the designer? How didit arise? Keep in mind that the hallmark of science is explaining theworkings of the natural world WITHOUT invoking magical forces or beings.That is why invoking a supernatural designer is no different from anyother religion, and is clearly NOT science.\n\nFrom what we have observed, intelligence must be preceded by at least13 billion years of time.\n\nPost by Bob WardlawHomeobox genes are short (about 180 base pairs) extremely ancient,highly conserved and are shared across the animal kingdom. More than100 homeobox genes are known. These genes also called Master Controlgenes, control the formation of eyes, hearts, limbs etc across theanimal kingdom.For example the eye across the animal phylum was believed to haveevolved at least 40 times, however, a single Master Control Genecalled Pax 6 has been responsible for the development of eyes in fruitflies (Drosophilia) further research found that the same gene or ahomeologue was found to control the development of eyes in vertebratesincluding zebra fish, squid, mice and all animals tested includinghumans. The discoverer of these genes, Professor Walter Gehring wasmet with considerable resistance by his peers. So, In an experiment hetook the Pax 6 gene from a mouse and placed it in various parts ofthefruit fly, Drosopholia, what appeared was eyes, not mouse eyes, butthe multi-fascited eyes of the fruit fly. So, a mouse Pax 6 Genecontrolled the formation of fly eyes in a fly.www.youris.com/Health/Genetics/One_Gene_One_Vision.klIt has been shown that another Master Control Gene called Tinman,(after Tinman movie charcter in the Wizare of OZ.) is responsible forthe formation of all types of hearts from the fruit fly nK2 homeoboxto humans. In humans this gene for unknown reasons is said to be ahomologue labled NkX2-5 homeobox gene. Yet these genes had to bepresent and highly functional during the Cambrian expansion.https://www.revolvy.com/main/index.php?s=Tinman%20genehttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gtr/genes/3227/What is not very well understood is exactly how these homeobox geneswork. But they are said to be played by upstream genes which selectthe sections of the homeobox genes which in turn switch on genes thatcascade downstream which express the type of eye, heart, as well asother body organ and parts. More than 100 of these master controlgenes are knownhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hox_geneAs a long term religious non-believer it it became difficult to turn ablind eye on the possible engineering concept show by this obviouslong term Hox genes which are virtually unchanged from the Cambrianand no doubt before the so called Cambrian explosion. This, to me. isclearly a case of appearance of highly functional and set genes longbefore they were needed for the Cambrian radiation. And they remainhighly conserved (another term for fixed) to the present day and incommon across the animal kingdom.\n\nThat's a basic feature of evolution: if something works, it is retained,and built upon.\n\nAs you must have noted I posed this matter as a question. It's beenpointed out before that evidence is sometimes subjective.People can observe the same yet arrive at different conclusions. You maysee this as supporting evolution whereas another could see this asevidence of design by a supernatural designer. I see both sides,however, I tend to be agnostic regarding the meaning. Your are rightevolution does use and improve on whatever works.\n\nThose who point to a supernatural designer consistently ignore theelephant in the room: what are the properties of the designer? How didit arise?\n\nFor two reasons, it doesn't matter how this supernatural deity arose:As in the case of evolution, how life arose is not pertinent to thevalidity of evolution. Abiogenesis and evolution are two differentscientific disciplines.We might have created life in a test tube, but how life actuallystarted, it's unfortunate, but doubtful we will ever reallyknow.As in the case of the universe, scientist, before the discovery of theBig Bang, thought the universe was always the same, eternal with nobeginning and no end. Even Albert Einstein and Fred Hoyle believed this.Dr. Hoyle attempted to give the eternal universe a scientific basis byadvancing his \"steady state theory\". The \"how\" did the universe arisewas not pertinent. It didn't matter to the observations scientist weremaking before the Big Bang discovery.\n\nIt's the same with the design in the universe. Where there might bedesign, how the designer arose is not pertinent to design. To argue it'ssomehow different is hypocrisy.\n\nKeep in mind that the hallmark of science is explaining the\n\nPost by MarkAworkings of the natural world WITHOUT invoking magical forces or beings.\n\nI agree with this comment. Scientist prefer to think of nature aswithin the confines of a scientific inquiry. This way everythingevery force and every action is under sciences and the \"authority\" ofscience. Whatever is deemed outside the realm of scientific inquiryand understanding is deemed non-scientific, superstition or magic.So, your expression here, while true, is just a modern philosophicalstance _advanced_ by philosophers of science and accepted by certainscientist and individuals who think of themselves as \"thinkers andrationalist\".\n\nPost by MarkAThat is why invoking a supernatural designer is no different from anyother religion, and is clearly NOT science.\n\nI totally agree with you it's not science. And neither is it necessaryto invoke a supernatural designer. There is no way, at present timeto know who, what or how design occurred. Perhaps it was evolutionby mutations and natural select over vast periods of time. But somepeople disagree with this. And they are within their rights and theyhave the right to defend their views when challenged or denounced, butdo not have the right to try forcing their views on others.\n\nMany early scientist were religious people whose religion did notalter, effect or influence their scientific experiments or research.I would point to Priest such as Gregor Mendel. He followed thescientific method in his experiments with peas: he is considered to bethe father of genetics.Another was Carl Linnaeus, a christian who believed that since Godcreated the world, it was possible to understand God's wisdom bystudying His creation. This is the man who gave us the current method ofclassification of organisms.Isaac Newton a Catholic who determined the force of gravity and gave uscalculus.Another Priest was Georges Lemaitre an astronomer who first saw inEinstein's theory of relativity and found his math showed universesexpansion and predicted a beginning which he called the Primal atom. Hegave us the (Big Bang theory, but Fred Hoyle sarcastically called itthe Big Bang.There were numerous Christians who are known as the fathers or mothersof many of the scientific disciplines we know today. While they usedthe scientific method they did not reject their religion. Neither didthey turn to their religion when engaging in scientific activities.\n\nIt might be intereisting to note that the modern scientific method inEurope was further developed by a Roger Bacon, a Franciscan frar whoturned to ancient Greek, ohilospher and Muslem scientist to furtherdevelop the scientific method.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Bacon\n\nAnother founder of the modern scientific method was Francis Bacon adevout Anglican and the father of induction.www.christianitytoday.com/history/people/scholarsandscientists/francis-bacon.html\n\nSo based on the significance contributions to science, it's obvious thatreligion is not a hinderance to science.\n\nPost by Bob WardlawAnd they are within their rights and theyhave the right to defend their views when challenged or denounced, butdo not have the right to try forcing their views on others.Isaac Newton a Catholic\n\nNope.
