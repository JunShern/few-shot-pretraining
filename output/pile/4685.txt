It's time to solicit some expert help. \nInformation:\n\nAcer Aspire One 532h-2676 \nAR9285 Wireless \nUbuntu 12.04 / Updated via ethernet connection (Ditched\nWindows - so this needs to work!)\n\nProblem:\nThe wireless device connects to the router and receives an internal IP, however, no amount of finagling seems to be able to provide me with anything save momentary internet access. I can ping -c 10 192.168.0.XX my address, but I can't ping the router (192.168.0.1) or the internet (google.ca/com). \nWhat I've tried and read elsewhere on askubuntu/linuxforums/ubuntuforums \n\nInstalled sudo apt-get install linux-backports-net-${uname -r) (Expected compatibility drivers)\nEdited ../ath9k.conf with options ath9k nohcrypt=1 (Read post about hardware encryption problem) \nTried using wicd instead (Read post that this worked for some pre 12.04)\nFully removed and reinstalled NM sudo apt-get purge network-manager* ... sudo apt-get install network-manager*(Read post that this worked for some) \n\nDetails People Usually Ask for on Other Questions \n$ sudo lshw -C network\n\n  *-network               \n       description: Ethernet interface\n       product: AR8132 Fast Ethernet\n       vendor: Atheros Communications Inc.\n       physical id: 0\n       bus info: pci@0000:01:00.0\n       logical name: eth1\n       version: c0\n       serial: 70:5a:b6:d8:99:53\n       capacity: 100Mbit/s\n       width: 64 bits\n       clock: 33MHz\n       capabilities: pm msi pciexpress vpd bus_master cap_list ethernet physical tp 10bt 10bt-fd 100bt 100bt-fd autonegotiation\n       configuration: autonegotiation=on broadcast=yes driver=atl1c driverversion=1.0.1.0-NAPI firmware=N/A latency=0 link=no multicast=yes port=twisted pair\n       resources: irq:45 memory:57000000-5703ffff ioport:5000(size=128)\n  *-network\n       description: Wireless interface\n       product: AR9285 Wireless Network Adapter (PCI-Express)\n       vendor: Atheros Communications Inc.\n       physical id: 0\n       bus info: pci@0000:02:00.0\n       logical name: wlan0\n       version: 01\n       serial: 78:e4:00:24:a0:19\n       width: 64 bits\n       clock: 33MHz\n       capabilities: pm msi pciexpress bus_master cap_list ethernet physical wireless\n       configuration: broadcast=yes driver=ath9k driverversion=3.2.0-26-generic-pae firmware=N/A ip=192.168.0.19 latency=0 link=yes multicast=yes wireless=IEEE 802.11bgn\n       resources: irq:17 memory:56000000-5600ffff\n\n$ rfkill list all\n\n0: phy0: Wireless LAN\n    Soft blocked: no\n    Hard blocked: no\n1: acer-wireless: Wireless LAN\n    Soft blocked: no\n    Hard blocked: no\n\n$ lspci\n\n00:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corporation N10 Family DMI Bridge\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation N10 Family Integrated Graphics Controller\n00:02.1 Display controller: Intel Corporation N10 Family Integrated Graphics Controller\n00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation N10/ICH 7 Family High Definition Audio Controller (rev 02)\n00:1c.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation N10/ICH 7 Family PCI Express Port 1 (rev 02)\n00:1c.1 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation N10/ICH 7 Family PCI Express Port 2 (rev 02)\n00:1d.0 USB controller: Intel Corporation N10/ICH 7 Family USB UHCI Controller #1 (rev 02)\n00:1d.1 USB controller: Intel Corporation N10/ICH 7 Family USB UHCI Controller #2 (rev 02)\n00:1d.2 USB controller: Intel Corporation N10/ICH 7 Family USB UHCI Controller #3 (rev 02)\n00:1d.3 USB controller: Intel Corporation N10/ICH 7 Family USB UHCI Controller #4 (rev 02)\n00:1d.7 USB controller: Intel Corporation N10/ICH 7 Family USB2 EHCI Controller (rev 02)\n00:1e.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 82801 Mobile PCI Bridge (rev e2)\n00:1f.0 ISA bridge: Intel Corporation NM10 Family LPC Controller (rev 02)\n00:1f.2 SATA controller: Intel Corporation N10/ICH7 Family SATA Controller [AHCI mode] (rev 02)\n00:1f.3 SMBus: Intel Corporation N10/ICH 7 Family SMBus Controller (rev 02)\n01:00.0 Ethernet controller: Atheros Communications Inc.
