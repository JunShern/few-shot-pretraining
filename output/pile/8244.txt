We modify the judgment to strike a \"no-contact\"\norder, and to award Pena an additional 185 days of presentence conduct credit, reverse\nand remand for resentencing regarding the out-on-bail enhancement, but otherwise\naffirm.\n\n\n1\n All further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless stated otherwise.\nReferences to section 12022.1 are to the version in effect prior to repeal effective January\n1, 2012.\n\f                          FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n              In 2011, Ventura County law enforcement agencies formed an auto theft\ntask force to investigate a theft operation involving Toyota Tacoma trucks stolen from\nLos Angeles County and sold to unsuspecting buyers in Ventura County. The stolen\ntrucks had fraudulent titles and displayed license plates stolen from other Tacoma trucks.\nThe trucks were parked on residential streets, marked for sale with a telephone number,\nand sold thereafter in cash transactions.\n              On June 20, 2011, Mario Delgado parked his Toyota Tacoma truck in front\nof his apartment in Los Angeles. Later that evening, he noticed that his truck was not\nthere and reported the theft to police.\n              Two days later, Abel Gutierrez saw a Toyota Tacoma truck parked on a\nresidential street in Ventura, marked with a \"For Sale\" sign. Gutierrez telephoned the\ncontact number and spoke to Baron Ramirez, who identified himself as \"Fernando.\"\nGutierrez informed Ramirez that he was interested in purchasing the truck.\n              Detective George Orozco, a California Highway Patrolman and member of\nthe auto theft task force, also saw the Toyota Tacoma truck marked for sale. The vehicle\nidentification number on the truck matched the vehicle identification number on the truck\nstolen from Delgado, but the license plate number differed. Orozco telephoned Ramirez,\nwho again identified himself as \"Fernando,\" and the two agreed to meet the following\nday.\n              In the afternoon of June 24, 2011, Orozco, working as an undercover\nofficer, arrived at the location of the truck to meet Ramirez. Other law enforcement\nmembers of the task force were nearby conducting surveillance. Ramirez left a black\nCrown Victoria automobile driven by Pena and walked toward the Tacoma truck. Pena\nthen drove away.\n              Gutierrez and his wife appeared and parked near the truck. Orozco\nintroduced himself to Ramirez and stated that he intended to purchase the truck. Ramirez\n\n\n                                            2\n\fstated that he would sell the truck to either Orozco or Gutierrez, but would permit\nGutierrez to \"test drive\" the truck first.\n                  During the test drive, Ramirez appeared nervous and dropped the sales\nprice by $1,000. Gutierrez inquired if title to the truck was \"clean,\" and Ramirez\nconfirmed that it was. Gutierrez then offered to purchase the truck for $6,500. When\nRamirez and Gutierrez returned from the test drive, they were arrested by members of the\nauto theft task force. Police officers later released Gutierrez. Ramirez stated to police\nofficers that he was unaware that the truck was stolen and that Pena was paying him to\nsell the truck.\n                  Within an hour, police officers conducted a traffic stop on the Crown\nVictoria automobile and arrested Pena. Officers found fraudulent registration and title\ndocuments concealed in the panels of the automobile and keys to other Toyota Tacoma\ntrucks on the floorboard. During a police interview, Pena denied knowledge of the stolen\nTacoma truck and stated that he drove Ramirez to Ventura as a favor. Pena also stated\nthat his name was \"Ladimiro Aranda\" and that he did not own the Crown Victoria\nautomobile. During booking at the police station, officers discovered Pena's true identity\nafter analyzing his fingerprints.\n                                 Prior Crimes & Common Plan\n                                 (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1101, subd. (b).)\n                  The prosecutor presented evidence that Pena had committed previous\ncrimes involving stolen vehicles. In 2007, Pena attempted to sell a stolen Honda Odyssey\nautomobile to an unsuspecting buyer. Law enforcement officers observed the attempted\nsale and then arrested Pena. A search revealed that Pena possessed fraudulent vehicle\ntitle documents.\n                  In 2010, two Toyota Tacoma trucks were stolen in Orange County and\ndriven to San Jose. Pena followed the trucks in a black Crown Victoria automobile. The\ntrucks were parked on a street in San Jose and marked for sale. Pena drove by and a\npassenger left his automobile to approach a prospective buyer. Police officers observed\n                                                3\n\fthe attempted transaction and arrested Pena and his passenger. Pena confessed and\nexplained the mechanics of the auto theft operation. At the time of trial on the present\noffenses, a prosecution against Pena was pending in Orange County.\n                                Conviction and Sentencing\n              The jury convicted Pena of receiving stolen property, possession of false\nvehicle registration documents, conspiracy to commit grand theft, two counts of\nattempted grand theft, and giving false information to a police officer. (\u00a7\u00a7 496d, subd.\n(a), 182, subd. (a)(1), 664, 487, subd. (a), 148.9, subd. (a); Veh. Code, \u00a7 4463, subd. (a).)\nIt acquitted him of the unlawful taking of a vehicle. (Veh. Code, \u00a7 10851, subd. (a).) In\na separate proceeding, Pena admitted the out-on-bail enhancement regarding the pending\nprosecution in Orange County. (\u00a7 12022.1, subd. (b).)\n              The trial court sentenced Pena to a prison term of six years four months,\nincluding a two-year consecutive term for the out-on-bail enhancement. The court\nimposed and stayed sentence for count 8, conspiracy to commit grand theft. It imposed a\n$1,320 restitution fine, a $1,320 parole revocation restitution fine (stayed), and a $200\ncourt security assessment, ordered victim restitution, and awarded Pena 553 days of\npresentence custody credit (369 days of actual custody and 184 days of conduct credit).\n(\u00a7\u00a7 1202.4, subd. (b), 1202.45, 1465.8, subd. (a).)\n              Pena appeals and contends that 1) there is insufficient evidence to support\nhis conviction of two counts of attempted grand theft, and 2) the trial court erred by not\nstaying sentence for attempted grand theft pursuant to section 654. He also raises several\nsentencing arguments that the Attorney General concedes.\n                                       DISCUSSION\n                                              I.\n              Pena argues that there is insufficient evidence of his specific intent to sell\nthe stolen truck to two prospective buyers. He asserts that the evidence supports\nconviction of only one count of attempted grand theft.\n\n\n                                              4\n\f              In reviewing the sufficiency of evidence to support a conviction, we\nexamine the entire record and draw all reasonable inferences therefrom in favor of the\njudgment to determine whether there is reasonable and credible evidence from which a\nreasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\n(People v. Streeter (2012) 54 Cal.4th 205, 241.) Our review is the same in a prosecution\nprimarily resting upon circumstantial evidence. (People v. Watkins (2012) 55 Cal.4th\n999, 1020.) We do not redetermine the weight of the evidence or the credibility of\nwitnesses. (People v. Albillar (2010) 51 Cal.4th 47, 60.) We must accept logical\ninferences that the jury might have drawn from the evidence although we would have\nconcluded otherwise. (Streeter, at p. 241.) \"If the circumstances reasonably justify the\ntrier of fact's findings, reversal of the judgment is not warranted simply because the\ncircumstances might also reasonably be reconciled with a contrary finding.\" (Albillar, at\np. 60.)\n              All persons involved in the commission of a crime, whether acting directly\nor aiding and abetting, are principals in the crime committed. (\u00a7 31; People v. Delgado\n(2013) 56 Cal.4th 480, 486.) A person aids and abets the commission of a crime when\nhe: 1) with knowledge of the unlawful purpose of the perpetrator, 2) and with intent or\npurpose of committing, facilitating, or encouraging commission of the crime, 3) by act or\nadvice, aids, promotes, encourages, or instigates the commission of the crime. (Id. at\np. 486.) The dividing line between the actual perpetrator and the aider and abettor often\nis blurred; when two or more persons commit a crime together, each may act in part as\nthe actual perpetrator and in part as the aider and abettor of the other. (Id. at p. 487.)\n              An attempt to commit a crime requires a specific intent to commit the crime\nand a direct but ineffectual act done toward its commission. (\u00a7 21a; People v. Watkins,\nsupra, 55 Cal.4th 999, 1018, fn. 9.) A defendant may be convicted of criminal attempt\nwhen he acts with the specific intent to engage in the conduct or bring about the\nconsequences proscribed by the attempted crime and performs an act that goes beyond\n\n\n                                               5\n\fmere preparation. (People v. Toledo (2001) 26 Cal.4th 221, 230; People v. Nguyen\n(2013) 212 Cal.App.4th 1311, 1323.)\n              Sufficient evidence supports Pena's conviction of two counts of attempted\ngrand theft. Pena aided and abetted Ramirez by driving him to Ventura to sell the stolen\nTacoma truck. Pena, who had been involved in a similar theft operation in Orange\nCounty, had fraudulent documents in his automobile when arrested. Ramirez, for his\npart, spoke to Gutierrez and Orozco separately, discussed price and arranged to meet to\ntest drive the truck. Each buyer appeared at the meeting place prepared to purchase the\ntruck. The sale to Gutierrez was prevented by police officers, and the sale to Orozco was\nprevented by Gutierrez's offer to purchase. Thus the jury could conclude that Ramirez\nhad the specific intent to sell the truck to either buyer and took direct but ineffectual steps\nto do so as to each. Although Pena and Ramirez could complete only one act of grand\ntheft concerning the truck, they could commit multiple acts of attempted grand theft\nregarding the same property.\n                                               II.\n              Pena contends that the trial court erred by not staying sentence on the two\ncounts of attempted grand theft (counts 9 and 10) because his criminal intent and\nobjective regarding those offenses was the same as his intent and objective regarding\nreceiving stolen property (count 6). (\u00a7 654.) He argues that the three offenses rest upon\nthe same physical act of selling the stolen Tacoma truck. (People v. Jones (2012) 54\nCal.4th 350, 360 [section 654 prohibits multiple punishment of unlawful possession of\nfirearm by a felon, carrying of concealed and unregistered firearm, and carrying\nunregistered and loaded firearm in public].)\n              Section 654, subdivision (a) provides: \"An act or omission that is\npunishable in different ways by different provisions of law shall be punished under the\nprovision that provides for the longest potential term of imprisonment, but in no case\nshall the act or omission be punished under more than one provision.\" Section 654 bars\nmultiple punishment for separate offenses arising out of a single occurrence where all of\n                                               6\n\fthe offenses were incident to one objective. (People v. McKinzie (2012) 54 Cal.4th 1302,\n1368.) We review the trial court's implied finding of a separate intent and objective for\nsufficient evidentiary support. (Ibid.) In this review, we do not assume a broad or\namorphous view of the defendant's intent and objective. (People v. Morelos (2008) 168\nCal.App.4th 758, 769.)\n              Sufficient evidence supports the trial court's implied finding that Pena had\ndistinct criminal intents and objectives regarding the receiving stolen property offense\nand the attempted grand theft offenses. The receiving stolen property offense concerned\npossession and concealment of the Tacoma truck from its owner; the attempted grand\ntheft offenses involved fraudulent sale of the truck to unsuspecting buyers. Concealing\nand possessing the truck necessarily preceded the attempted grand thefts. The truck was\ntaken from Los Angeles County, its license plates changed, and was placed for sale in\nVentura County. Pena's objective in count 6 involved concealing and possessing stolen\nproperty, Delgado's truck. Pena's objective in counts 9 and 10 involved obtaining cash\nfrom potential buyers in exchange for fraudulent title. Under the circumstances, section\n654 does not prohibit multiple punishment.\n                                             III.\n              Pena raises several sentencing issues that the Attorney General properly\nconcedes. First, he contends that he is entitled to an additional 185 days of presentence\nconduct credit. (Former \u00a7 2933, subd. (e).) Second, he asserts that the trial court lacked\njurisdiction to enter a no-contact order with certain persons, absent statutory authority or\nevidence that he threatened a witness. (People v. Robertson (2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 965,\n995-996 [no-contact order without statutory authorization or evidentiary support is an\nunauthorized sentence that may be raised for the first time on appeal].) Third, he points\nout that the court was required to stay execution of the out-on-bail enhancement because\nhe has not yet been convicted of the Orange County offense. (\u00a7 12022.1, subd. (d)\n[\"Whenever there is a conviction for the secondary offense and the enhancement is\nproved, and the person is sentenced on the secondary offense prior to the conviction of\n                                              7\n\fthe primary offense, the imposition of the enhancement shall be stayed pending\nimposition of the sentence for the primary offense\"].)\n              The abstract of judgment also incorrectly reflects Pena's conviction of\nreceiving stolen property as a violation of section 469d, subdivision (a), rather than\nsection 496d, subdivision (a). The trial court shall amend the abstract of judgment to\nreflect the correct Penal Code section.\n              We modify the judgment to strike the no-contact order, and to award Pena\nan additional 185 days of presentence conduct credit, and reverse and remand for\nresentencing regarding the out-on-bail enhancement, but otherwise affirm. The trial court\nshall amend the abstract of judgment accordingly and forward it to the Department of\nCorrections and Rehabilitation.\n              NOT TO BE PUBLISHED.\n\n\n\n\n                                          GILBERT, P.J.\n\nWe concur:\n\n\n\n\n              YEGAN, J.\n\n\n\n\n              PERREN, J.\n\n\n\n\n                                             8\n\f                                 Ryan J.
