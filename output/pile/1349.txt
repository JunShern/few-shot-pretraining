This new line of proposed Bruce Crow laws in the south aren't enough, right-wing shiatheads here are trying to further influence an already unhinged country into going full-on Nazi in regard to gays? You know who else made it a crime to not report gay people? THE NAZIS. THAT'S NOT EVEN THE JOKE.\n\nWell the thing is everyone in a country like that should be scared of laws like that, even the homophobes. It seems unlikely Uganda's court system is infallible, so if someone doesn't like them and decides to report them as gay, are they so sure they could prove they aren't to a jury probably full of people like themselves?\n\nAlphax:markfara: Alphax: FirstNationalBastard: Will they eat da poopoo for lunch?\n\nI'm sure it was American conservatives who told that guy to say that.\n\nYes. They had an awesomely advanced civilization until the conservatives got involved. Or something.\n\n/Not the least bit conservative.//But, you know, come on, here. . . .\n\nI've heard the American conservatives were telling the same stories about gay people in the 1950's. So, yeah, pack up the old 'textbooks' and mail them overseas.. and they say the same shiat again.\n\nNo argument here. My point is that the conservatives didn't jump into some advanced, well-developed culture and make it all anti-gay. They're exploiting a market-niche, absolutely, but they didn't create it. And it would most likely still exist if they hadn't gotten involved.\n\nEver notice how when the Fark Islamophobes are comparing Muslims to Christians, the Christians they use as examples of comparison are not these third world Christians, whose economic and educational circumstances are actually similar to those of most Muslims? Always nice, safe, tame Christians from America?That's because it would be a valid comparison, and Christians wouldn't come out looking any better."
