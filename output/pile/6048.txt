    "text": "IGF-I is a hormone with a molecular structure similar to insulin. It is a peptide produced by the liver and contains 70 amino acids in a single chain with three intramolecular disulfide bridges. IGF-I has a molecular weight of about 7,649 Da, and is highly protein bound in serum. Production is stimulated by growth hormone and can be retarded by undernutrition, growth hormone insensitivity, lack of growth hormone receptors, or failure of a downstream signaling pathway. IGF-I plays an important role in childhood growth and continues to have anabolic effects in adults.\nInsulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) is also a hormone with a molecular structure similar to insulin. It is a single chain peptide that contains 67 amino acids. IGF-II has a molecular weight of about 7,505 Da, and is highly protein bound in serum. IGF-II is used as an adjunct to insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) in clinical evaluation of growth hormone-related disorders. IGF-II plays a role primarily in fetal growth and development by interplaying with IGF-I and different cell surface receptors and circulating binding proteins to modulate tissue growth. IGF-II levels are reduced in children and adults as a result of growth hormone deficiency or malnutrition. Increased IGF-II serum levels may be observed in acromegaly or with exogenous administration of IGF-I. Thus, measurement of circulating IGF-II levels (i.e. in plasma/serum) is an important tool in management of several growth hormone-related disorders. In addition, measurement of circulating IGF-II is also a valuable tool in various epidemiological research areas and clinical trials.\nIGF-I and IGF-II have proven to be particularly challenging to quantitatively analyze with a \u201cbottom up\u201d approach (i.e., enzymatic digestion and quantitation of one or more of the resulting peptides). For example, de Kock, et al. reported that typical trypsin, chymotrypsin, and pepsin digestion methods result in low digestion yield and non-specific enzyme cleavage. de Kock, et al., Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom., 2001, 15:1191-97. de Kock, et al. suggested that the unsatisfactory digestion results were likely due to steric restriction of the proteolytic enzymes by IGF-I's three disulfide bonds. Id.\nEfforts have been made to develop methods to analyze IGF-I and IGF-II, including by a variety of mass spectrometric techniques. For example, analysis of IGF-I has been reported using LC-ion trap MS with single ion monitoring (SIM). See, e.g., Id.; Bobin, et al., Analyst, 2001, 126:1996-2001; and Popot, et al., Chromatographia, 2001, 54:737-741 (Popot I). These references disclose LC-ESI-ion trap MS of intact IGF-I at charge states ranging from 4+ to 9+ in SIM mode. More recently, LC-MS/MS techniques using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) have been disclosed. Popot II reports quantitative analysis of IGF-I at charge states ranging from 4+ to 9+ using LC-ion trap MS with SIM, followed by qualitative confirmation of the analyte with LC-ion trap MS/MS using MRM. Popot, et al., Anal Bioanal Chem, 2008, 390:1843-52 (Popot II). The MRM experiments use selected multicharged IGF-I ions (7+ and 8+) as precursor ions in the fragmentation experiments. Bredeh\u00f6ft, et al. reports using an orbitrap mass spectrometric instrument to qualitatively determine the mass to charge ratios of precursor and product ions of IGF-I and use of the identified ions for subsequent IGF-I quantitation using LC-triple quadrupole MS/MS. Bredeh\u00f6ft, et al., Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom., 2008, 22:477-485.\nSimilarly, analysis of IGF-II has been reported using enzymatic digestion followed by mass spectrometric analysis of the digestion products. See, e.g., Smith et al., J. Biol. Chem., 1989, 16:9314-9321; and Bayne et al., Peptide Research, 1990, 6:271-273. Other studies have been reported for analysis of mass spectrometric detection of intact IGF-II. See, e.g., Hampton et al., J. Biol. Chem., 1989, 32:19155-19160; Hayne, et al., J. Chromatog. 1991, 52:391-402; Wadensten, et al., Biotech. and App. Biochem., 1991, 13:412-421; Jespersen, et al., J. Mass Spectrom., 1996, 31:893-900; and Nelson, et al., J. Proteome, 2004, 3:851-855. These references report detection of intact IGF-II with plasma desorption and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric techniques. Hampton et al. detects charge states ranging from 1+ to 3+. All but Hampton et al. detect IGF-II at a 1+ charge state."
