    "text": "Dot Dot Dash Bag\n\nIf you're new here, you may want to sign up for my newsletter which includes new pattern releases and fabric sales. Enter your email for a free copy of my Oslo Craft Bag sewing pattern, an exclusive pattern just for my followers. In providing your email address, this will enroll you for my monthly newsletter, which will keep you up-to-date on my new patterns, free tutorials, videos, and other news.\n\nI\u2019m really happy to announce the first pattern to go up in my pattern shop, the Dot Dot Dash Bag, available in pdf or paper! This is a bag that features 5 zippers on the front of the bag, and a top closure in the form of a recessed zipper. The strap is adjustable. The pattern is intermediate/advanced sewing level.\n\nMy pattern instructions call for use of By Annie\u2019s Soft and Stable, which is a thin, foam sew-in interfacing (although I do give alternative interfacing suggestions in my pattern instructions, such as Pellon Thermolam/needled fleece for a great slouchy bag). If you do decide to use the Soft and Stable, your bag will be padded, so it is the perfect carrying accessory for your laptop, Kindle, iPad, etc.!\n\nI\u2019d also like to give a big virtual hug to Alison Glass, fabric designer for Andover Fabrics, who designed my pattern cover. She got it just right on the first crack, which shows just how talented she is. Alison has a line out right now called \u2018Lucky Penny\u2019 (and my bag is made using the Column print from Lucky Penny), and will have \u2018Field Day\u2019 coming in June.\n\nMy friend Tiffany of This Crafty Fox made this gorgeous version of the bag in Joel Dewberry fabrics. This bag is also featured in the pattern. Tiffany put up with my constant worry-worting about the pattern instructions and was a really good sport about it. \ud83d\ude09\n\nI had quite a lot of pattern testers for this bag. My heart skipped a beat each time a new one appeared in my inbox. It\u2019s kind of something to see someone make something from a pattern that you\u2019ve written. I will probably always feel this way, but it makes me feel like\u2026well, you have so many sewing pattern choices when it comes to bag making. That you\u2019ve chosen to make a bag that I\u2019ve written makes me feel incredibly honored. Thank you to all the testers who spent the time making these bags and providing me with feedback on my instructions.\n\nThis lovely version of the bag was made by Christy of a.Amelia Handmade. Christy makes beautiful iPad sleeves and other accessories in her shop. Her bag is a total winner in my book\u2026my favorite color is green and Echino is one of my favorite fabric designers, so enough said!!\n\nMaryellen made this cosmic bag out of spacey Michael Miller fabrics! I love the brown in the corner accents, it really makes those pockets pop!\n\nAllison made this beautiful yellow Dot Dot Dash, and I think her fussy-cutting on the front of the bag through the zippers was seamless\u2026you can\u2019t even tell that that fabric had to be cut and seamed! Great job Allison!!\n\nLindsey of LRstitched made this awesome bag in gingham and suede. I think it turned out fabulous, and I love the zipper pulls that she added herself! Lindsey ran the Zakka Style sew along last year, and she has another slated for April\u2026Patchwork Please! Follow the Flickr group to be notified when it starts!\n\nThis beautiful version made in Joel Dewberry fabric was made by Lisa of Six Munchkin Stitching. Lisa makes memory quilts, gift bags, and more! I especially adore the green woodgrain fabrics on the corners!\n\nTy Pennington fabric really made this stunning bag from Cindy of Raspberry Sunshine. Cindy was very quick on her toes and used this automotive headliner fabric from Hancock\u2019s in place of the Soft and Stable interfacing (I had to ask my husband what exactly automotive headliner fabric was, lol). She said it gave the bag great body and was easy to sew through!\n\nThis bag was made by Sharon, who upcycled an old jumper to make her bag; she loved the fabric of the jumper, but no longer wanted to wear it. What a great idea!!\n\nDiane made this great bag out of Washi Tape fabrics\u2026so awesome! I also love the different-colored zippers\u2026it really brings out the washi effect! You can find Diane on her Flickr\u2026you should check it out, she\u2019s a phenomenal quilter!\n\nMia of Mia\u2019s Creations made this lovely bag using upholstery fabrics and fleece interfacing instead of the Soft and Stable. I just love this, it looks like something you would find in a boutique shop! Maria also blogged about her bag, so you can read more about what she thinks!\n\nAnna from Charmed Liebling made this bag in some really awesome fabric\u2026the fabric has a really European flair. I think the different-colored fabrics for the accent and zippers really make it stand out! It looks just gorgeous!!\n\nCarolyn made this black and white version with the neon zippers\u2026how awesome that those zippers stand out like that! Carolyn is using her bag to tote her laptop, with her Kindle in a pocket!\n\nRachel made this beautiful version, and she was very careful to fussy cut her large-scale print across the zippered panels! I also adore her contrasting accents and strap!\n\nShelley of Pure and Simple Creations made this awesome version in pink and orange, and as you can see by the photo, this bag is very functional! She\u2019s got all her knitting supplies packed inside!\n\nSally from Life in Sally\u2019s World made this great version of the bag with Anna Maria Horner fabric and some denim for the corner pockets. She just took a trip to Las Vegas and was happy that the bag fit her Macbook Air inside! Sally sent me her edits while traveling\u2026isn\u2019t she a trooper?!\n\nAllegory of {sew} Allegorical made the only patchwork version in the group (the pattern has instructions to make the bag in patchwork if you so choose!). I love the fabrics she chose, they are so bright and happy!\n\nCorrina of Another Thing Off the List (love the blog name too!) made this beautiful floral bag. The fabrics are so soft and pretty, this is a real winner!\n\nAlli from B. Yazoo made this awesome bag in a smokey corduroy with chartreuse accents and a fun lining fabric. She was very thorough with her tester feedback, and I think this bag looks incredibly well-put-together and sturdy!\n\nMary made this paisley version of the pattern. I love the red fabric used for the accents and the lining, it perfectly coordinates with the paisley! What a great bag!\n\nI had the pleasure of meeting Vanessa at Sewing Summit this past October, and she made this gorgeous country girl version of the bag. So pretty! It\u2019s a gift for her mom, and I just think it\u2019s perfect!\n\nAnnette used denim for her bag, with floral for the lining and front accents. I love the dark colors of the bag, and the black zippers really make those panels stand out!\n\nNorma from Norma\u2019s Clay on Etsy made this stunning gray and white bag. Norma makes cool accessories made from beautiful clay in her shop, so check it out if you have a chance! I can\u2019t get over this bag, it is so pretty!\n\nPeta from Australia has made this gorgeous bag. Peta has quite a history with crochet, embroidery, and sewing, so I am very honored that she tested my pattern for me!\n\nKelie made this great version with brightly-colored butterfly fabrics. I love that the front curved accent fabrics continue through the side panels, it gives the bag a great finished look! Kelie also reviewed this bag on her blog!\n\nThank you again so much to everyone for all your hard work!!! If you liked what you saw and would like to purchase my sewing pattern, please visit my pattern shop!\n\n31 replies on \u201cDot Dot Dash Bag\u201d\n\nI have been waiting to see what your first pattern will be. I didn\u2019t expect anything less! This looks like a lot of fun. And i LOVE that you have so many examples to show and advertise. Great job. Keep up the good work!\n\nSara congratulations on your pattern \u2013 it\u2019s fantastic! I love the ones your testers made \u2013 as soon as I saw the taupey/coffee/caramelly upholstery fabric one I knew who made it \u2013 Maria is a bloggy buddy of mine, and does amazing work! I quite like your pattern and will order it tomorrow when I get my gift card \u201cregistered\u201d so I can start to shop with it \ud83d\ude42\n\nIt is great when other people make stuff from your own patterns, quite scary waiting to see if the instructions work- but so very exciting to see all the versions and how different the same pattern can look. For me, that is the best bit of designing- beats the initial rush of the idea and the fabric stroking stage by a whisker! It is a great design, hope it goes well for you.\n\nAll these bags look absolutely amazing! You all did a wonderful job. \ud83d\ude42\n\nSara, I do have a question for you\u2026 Do you think (not just for me ha ha but for others as well) write up a post on how you go about picking out your fabrics for purses. I always have a hard time figuring out what \u201cfabrics\u201d would be good for a purse. I know there isn\u2019t a right or wrong way to picking out fabric, but sometimes using too much print or not enough pop or solids or or\u2026 Yeah, lol so I would love it if you could dabble into how you go about picking out fabrics and how you pair it up with other fabrics.\n\nI had a similar question to the one Rachel posted above. Has anyone attempted to size this down so that the largest pocket space would hold a kindle? I\u2019m trying desperately to find a pattern I like that would allow me to carry all the regular purse type stuff and my kindle, but I really don\u2019t like to carry such a large bag. Any tips you might have about sizing it down would be amazing.\n\nJan\n\nI see that the current Dot Dot Dash Bag pattern contains two sizes. I have the older pattern PDF with only the larger size, but I want to make the smaller size. How do I get the new smaller size instructions without having to buy the whole pattern again?"
