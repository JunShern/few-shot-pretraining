Then she makes a collage with the snippets she removed and (I think) whatever else she wants to use (that's the part of the directions I need to read soon). Hopefully, I will make my collage this weekend and post it here!Here's some photos of the box (above) and what I took out & what I put in.This is what I took out.\n\nThis looks like FUN!! I have hoards of snippets! Hoards and masses and piles and mountains of snippets!! Maybe I'll start one of these projects in the near future. I'm already involved in 2 round robins and couldn't handle throwing another in the mix just now, though. But thanks for sharing about this excellent idea for a project!"
