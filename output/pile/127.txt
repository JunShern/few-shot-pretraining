Perfect timing too, because (for some weird reason) we should remind ourselves what actual totalitarian governments are like.\n\n\n\n\nThe novel, written by Fabien Nury and illustrated by Thierry Robinshows, focuses on the events between March 2 and March 4, 1953. According to the publisher, it was \u201ctwo days that encapsulated all the insanity, the perversity, and the inhumanity of totalitarianism.\u201d\n\n\nThe graphic novel reveals the scary reality behind Stalin\u2019s control in the days before his death. For example, it opens with an orchestra being forced by the military to play for hours so Stalin could get a recorded version of their performance. After Stalin\u2019s heart attack, the novel goes into the attempts to keep the dictator alive, while members of his government conspire against one another to secure power after his inevitable death. Everyday people are treated like pawns\u2014 they live in fear and are ordered to do unspeakable things. Many are imprisoned or killed for slight offenses.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a story of violence and greed in a society that\u2019s been corrupted by absolute power. It\u2019s a stern reminder of what dictatorships are really like, taking propaganda away to show the true effect they have on people. However, the creators did say it\u2019s technically historical fiction, even though it\u2019s based on real events, because of how patchy and incomplete recounts from those days are.\n\nG/O Media may get a commission Aurora by Bellesa Buy for $74 from Bellesa Boutique Use the promo code AURORA25\n\nTitan Comics will be printing a new English version of the graphic novel, as announced at ComicsPRO this week. In part, it\u2019s because of the film adaptation by Veep creator Armando Iannucci, which has gotten U.S. distribution by IFC. The reprint should be available this fall. However, for those who want to check it out sooner, there\u2019s a translated version available on Amazon Kindle.\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter]"
