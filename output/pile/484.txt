We believe that when you succeed we also do. Every creative agency you work at will have an opportunity to rate you as you will have to rate them. This rating will ensure that you get properly recognized for the great quality of work you present.\n\nWe believe a CV and Portfolio\u2019s are important, but we place a great deal of value on the trust and recommendation of people you have previously worked with. This may mean that one great recommendation by an Agency could go a lot further than an applicant with a sterling CV. This means that once you in our system and work for one of our partners, chances are that you become a more hire able individual."
