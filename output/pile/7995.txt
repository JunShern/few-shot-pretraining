    "text": "Since popular pastor Mark Driscoll asked his followers to share stories about \u201cthe most effeminate anatomically male worship leader you\u2019ve ever personally witnessed,\u201d other Christians have taken note of something many atheists have known for quite some time: Christianity doesn\u2019t make you a better, kinder, or more empathetic person. If anything, the Christianity we\u2019re used to is hypocritical, intolerant, and the source of so much pain for so many people.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that Driscoll didn\u2019t say anything out of the ordinary here \u2014 not for him and not on behalf of many other \u201cfollowers of Jesus.\u201d Gay people are used to this type of bullying from prominent Christians.\n\nThe upside to all this is that some Christians are speaking out against Driscoll. Like Rachel Held Evan, who calls him a bully (in Christianese):\n\nMark Driscoll is wrong. Godly men stick up for people, not make fun of them. Godly men honor women, not belittle them. Godly men love their gay and lesbian neighbors, not ridicule them. Godly men celebrate femininity, not trash it. \u2026 If this Facebook status were Pastor Mark Driscoll\u2019s first offense, it might not warrant a strong response. But Mark has developed a pattern of immaturity and unkindness that has remained largely unchecked by his church. In evangelical circles, he\u2019s like the kid from high school who makes crude jokes at every opportunity, uses the words \u201cgay\u201d and \u201cqueer\u201d to describe the things he most detests, encourages his friends to subject the unpopular kids to ridicule, and belittles the guys who aren\u2019t \u201cmacho\u201d or \u201cmanly\u201d enough to be in his club.\n\nAnthony Bradley at (Christian) World magazine called Rachel\u2019s response \u201clibel\u201d:\n\nThere is nothing loving about calling a pastor a \u201cbully\u201c \u2014 that is, \u201ca blustering, quarrelsome, overbearing person who habitually badgers and intimidates smaller or weaker people.\u201d That is a serious charge. In her post, Evans describes why she believes Driscoll to be a bully, implying that he, his teachings, and the elders at his church are not functioning in ways consistent with Scripture. While it is more than reasonable to understand why someone would take issue with Driscoll\u2019s post, Evans\u2019 way of responding cannot and should not be encouraged. What was even more disturbing was the way in which many other believers jumped on the slander bandwagon to feed on the carnage once it went viral.\n\nYeah\u2026 how *dare* a woman call out a pastor for not being properly Christian? She should know better and remain submissive and silent. (I\u2019m curious what Bradley would have preferred she said\u2026)\n\nIn any case, Rachel wasn\u2019t the only person calling Driscoll out.\n\nTyler L. Clark expressed it beautifully, too:\n\nThe Church has been terrible to gays and lesbians. You have surely spent enough time talking with gay people in your community to know that the image of Christians tends to be a hateful one. In the same way that you want church culture to be more welcoming to blue-collar dudes, it also needs to be more welcoming to the gay and lesbian community. Your language\u2026 doesn\u2019t help this. I am NOT calling you a misogynist or a [homophobe]. I\u2019m simply suggesting that you reconsider how your words and actions are perceived. Your language is not only hurtful to gay men. It is hurtful to many straight men. As a man who has always been intimidated by more traditionally masculine men, your words tell me that I am not welcome in your church or among your friends.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to pigeonhole all Christians into the anti-gay, anti-women umbrella, but there are some good ones out there and they\u2019re as sick of this shit as we are.\n\n\u2026\n\nDriscoll has since responded to the outcry with a non-apology apology:\n\nI then put a flippant comment on Facebook, and a raging debate on gender and related issues ensued. As a man under authority, my executive elders sat me down and said I need to do better by hitting real issues with real content in a real context. And, they\u2019re right. Praise God I have elders who keep me accountable and that I am under authority.\n\n\u2026\n\nCoincidentally (or not), someone wrote to \u201cDear Abby\u201d about a similar problem:\n\nDear Abby:\n\nWe have a problem \u2014 our pastor. He uses the pulpit to criticize, put people down and offers no compassion. A person can only take so much. The problem is, if you say anything to him, you can bet the next sermon will be about what you discussed. How can I talk to him without making him angry?\n\nThe response:\n\nYour pastor\u2019s behavior gives new meaning to the term \u201cbully pulpit.\u201d Rather than approach him yourself, you and others who feel as you do should take your complaint to the governing board of your church. And if that doesn\u2019t fix the problem, you should seriously consider finding another \u201cflock\u201d to join because it appears your shepherd has lost his way.\n\n\n\n"
