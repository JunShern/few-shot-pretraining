My only real critizism is of the Special Teams play, and why we can't get a decent kicker.\n\narrowheadrocks\n\n10-05-2004, 12:25 AM\n\nLove the new pic in the sig line, JBret!\n\ntommykat\n\n10-05-2004, 12:25 AM\n\nDefense rocked............Green really gave his heart running and being hit to try to make the 1st down.\n\nand Ray was whining \"There's always 2 of them on me coach!

We only won by 3, but we dominated the best defense in the game and held one of the best backs in the league to under 75 yards. Oh yeah, and we beat a playoff-contender in their house on Monday Night.\n\nHuge, and very proud to be a Chief fan tonight.\n\nA bit disappointed that the D won't get the praise it should though. People will see 24 points in the column for Baltimore and think our defense played like it always does. Not true at all.\n\narrowheadrocks\n\n10-05-2004, 12:28 AM\n\nand Ray was whining \"There's always 2 of them on me coach!

Baltimore would've kicked the FG there.\n\nAnd what you don't see in the box score is field position. We buried our defense with bad field position all night. Our special teams has been the reasons teams have put up the numbers they have. Can't expect to keep forcing punts when teams get the ball at midfield every drive.\n\nFrankie\n\n10-05-2004, 01:44 AM\n\nTo the rest of AFC West:\n\nObjects in your rear view mirror are closer than they appear.\n\n|Zach|\n\n10-05-2004, 01:48 AM\n\nTo the rest of AFC West:\n\nObjects in your rear view mirror are closer than they appear.\nNiiiiice\n\nAnd I really loved it when one of BAL's O-lineman knocked Boller down.

Our special teams has been the reasons teams have put up the numbers they have. Can't expect to keep forcing punts when teams get the ball at midfield every drive.Your more correct than you know concerning the special teams. They have been absolutely putrid so far this year. I know they miss Bo terribly but damn.... Some guys just have to be able to tackle. And Baker... Well, I don't even want to go there. When is Cheeks due back? Special teams have contributed more to the 3 losses then the media has let on.:banghead:\n\ntk13\n\n10-05-2004, 02:28 AM\n\nBo is a big loss on ST... but don't forget Bartee... he always seems to be around the ball in coverage.\n\nChiefFripp\n\n10-05-2004, 02:46 AM\n\nRep the pain away!\n\nFairplay\n\n10-05-2004, 03:40 AM\n\nDamn that win felt good!\n\nMark M\n\n10-05-2004, 06:58 AM\n\nBo is a big loss on ST... but don't forget Bartee... he always seems to be around the ball in coverage.\n\nExactly.\n\nThe coverage units are missing some much needed speed right now -- Bo is hurt, Bartee has been banged up, and Biesel doesn't play on the coverage unit anymore.\n\nThose three guys have been huge on STs the last few years, and are no longer in there.\n\nI did, however, see LJ out there during the 4th qtr. Not sure if he was playing the whole game or not. IMHO, that would be the best way to show his teammates that he's not a crybaby putz -- play some STs and make some plays.\n\nMM\n~~:arrow:\n\nKingPriest2\n\n10-05-2004, 07:14 AM\n\nThat was a great game we just need to keep it going.\n\nDave Lane\n\n10-05-2004, 07:17 AM\n\nCount me in on rep fest 1-3.
