    "text": "Sometimes we\u2019re given tasks out of left field that seem rather strange. Other times, we see oddball tasks, and we latch on with reckless abandon. I\u2019ve done one of those second ones.\n\nThere\u2019s a decent chance that, within the next year, I\u2019m going to need to support an increased user base. Well, it\u2019s not going to happen with the existing infrastructure, I can tell you that.\n\nRight now, I\u2019m stretched for wall jacks, our desks are a collection of an old set plus the occasional folding table, and I\u2019ve currently got a hutch sitting on the ground acting as a table. We\u2019re going to need more stuff. Preferably different stuff, actually, because what we\u2019ve got right now are glorified tables. The occasional cable grommet carved into the top is about all I can say these desks do for me. I want better. We all run laptops. I want desks with electrical, network, and phone ports on the desktop. I want walls. I want world peace, too, but I\u2019d settle for not having to fear for my life every time I push too hard on a hutch and it threatens to tip over because it isn\u2019t attached by anything.\n\nOf course, I can\u2019t actually buy anything, or even make the decisions. According to all of those forms I fill out to read whitepapers, I \u201cinfluence\u201d the decision. But if I\u2019m going to influence the decision, I\u2019m going to know what I want, and I\u2019m going to make sure it\u2019s the right resource for the job. It was for that reason that I started asking around. \u201cDo we have building plans for the office?\u201d\n\nAs an aside, there\u2019s an old saying that I\u2019m fond of. \u201cBeware of programmers carrying screwdrivers.\u201d Sysadmins who ask for building plans can\u2019t be too far behind.\n\nAs it turns out, we do have schematics from when we ordered the construction done on the office, before we moved in. It\u2019s not entirely up to date, but it gives me all of the measurements that I needed to produce a to-scale drawing in Visio. I worked on it for a while, and produced a pretty respectable diagram, I think.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever used Visio for any kind of layout like this, you\u2019ve probably seen the built-in shapes for things like cubicles, desks, office chairs, etc etc. I was using the default \u201ccubicle\u201d shape, at the default size, and I started to realize that what I was seeing on paper didn\u2019t add up to what I had experienced in real life. Never one to take a challenge to my reality while sitting down, I broke out my tape measure and started looking.\n\nI found out that while the average workspace in my office is 7ft x 7ft, the default Visio cubicle is 8ft x 8ft. That sounds more reasonable, but as I said, we\u2019ve been working fine with 7ft\u00b2. I looked at a couple of sites and they make cubicles from 10ft down to 5ft, and everywhere in between.\n\nSo here\u2019s my dilemma\u2026how big should the cubicles be. On one hand, I have a certain number of people that will be necessary to add, and a finite amount of space. On the other hand, I don\u2019t want anyone to go insane and shoot people. Or gut fish in the office.\n\nDo you have a full on office, desk, or cube? How big is your workspace, and how cramped do you feel? I\u2019m interested in hearing from a lot of people to try to get a feel, so please, drop me a comment below. Thanks!"
