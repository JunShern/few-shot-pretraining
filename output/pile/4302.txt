    "text": "Rupert Murdoch, the 81-year-old chief executive of News Corp., has been told by a select committee of the British parliament that he is \u201cunfit\u201d to head his global media conglomerate.\n\nIt is a particularly British accusation and one that is especially punishing, both because it is so indelible and is so seldom used.\n\n\u201cUnfit\u201d is not a charge that is often leveled, so its impact is especially great. In 1971 a publishing rival of Murdoch\u2019s, Robert Maxwell, was indicted as being \u201cunfit\u201d to run a public company. His were sins of greed and venality.\n\nMurdoch\u2019s sins, you might say, are sins of encouraging a culture of corruption in two of his London-based tabloid newspapers: the defunct News of the World and The Sun. It should be said that Murdoch did not invent the culture of Britain\u2019s tabloid press, but he encouraged it to lengths of excess that had not been dreamed of earlier.\n\nFleet Street \u2014 the collective name for British newspapers which derives from the street where they were once all located \u2014 has always been a place of excess. But things really turned white hot in the late 1950s and 1960s.\n\nTelevision and radio were competing for entertainment value, but news was still the province of newspapers. The game was to shock the readers without depressing them. The publisher Lord Beaverbrook said during World War II of his Daily Express: \u201cI want the readers to feel the sun is shining when they read the Express.\u201d\n\nWhen I arrived in Fleet Street, well after the war, the sun was still shining in the popular papers. And what better way to keep the sun shining than by exposing the foibles of the aristocracy, the Royal Family and, of course, film stars?\n\nWe, the denizens of Fleet Street, were modestly paid but were given essentially unlimited expense accounts to disport ourselves around the clubs and restaurants of London in search of the rich and famous at unguarded play. The culture was one of discover, speculate, elaborate and publish.\n\nReporters were pushed very hard to dig up the titillating, embellish it and present it as news. We descended on crime scenes, the sexually engaged and the overtly greedy.\n\nYet there were limits, unwritten but understood, especially pertaining to private grief and even the Royal Family. Infidelity from a vicar was reportable. Similarly rumored goings on by major politicians and national figures, less so.\n\nBut change was on its way in the shape of Rupert Murdoch, and in the growing force of television in British life. Murdoch trashed the barriers, such as they were. He started publishing pictures of bare-breasted girls in The Sun, and turned his tabloids from being newspapers that published gossip along with the news to gossip-only papers. They became vicious as well as tawdry.\n\nMurdoch also turned his papers from leaning politically left-wing to being savagely right-wing. It worked.\n\nThe Sun and the News of the World started making enough money to finance Murdoch\u2019s other ventures, including buying and building Fox News.\n\nMurdoch established an even more irresponsible culture. There were no rules now: Hence the phone-tapping, police bribing and other sins that have brought Murdoch to his sorry state of being \u201cunfit.\u201d There was a new thuggery and vulgarity that had not existed.\n\nYet if Murdoch is unfit, so are his accusers. It is British politicians \u2014 including Margaret Thatcher, Tony Blair and David Cameron and their followers \u2014 who indulged Murdoch, courted him and encouraged the arrogance of Fleet Street.\n\nBritish newspaper publishers have always considered it their right to have access to the prime minister and no holder of that office has sought to disillusion them. \u2013 For the Hearst-New York Times Syndicate\n\nWhite House Chronicle on Social\n\nThere is disquiet in the soul of America. It has been expressed night after night on the streets of more than 100 towns and cities. That number of urban sites, with all those tens of thousands of people, are a cry from the hurting heart of America \u2014 yes, over the death of George Floyd, [\u2026]\n\nA plow breaks up the soil, turns it over. If seed is put down, that sprouts along with any other seed that happens to be there, weeds and other wild plants. The new normal will be a plowed field where all sorts of innovations will spring forth. It will be a time of innovation, creativity [\u2026]\n\nSnapshots. That\u2019s what we have of the United States as we emerge tentative and fraught from lockdown. We don\u2019t have the whole picture, just snapshots of this and that. Some of the snapshots are encouraging: The air is clearer, crime is down and a collective spirit is apparent in many places. Others are more disturbing: [\u2026]\n\nA study envisioning how societies might address the complexities of the COVID-19 pandemic, undertaken by more than 70 leaders in innovation from around the world, is out. It is the largest, nongovernmental study on the virus, and it paints a picture of a world recalibrated by it \u2014 with a heavy dependence on data in [\u2026]"
