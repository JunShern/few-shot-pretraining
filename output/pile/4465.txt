Also I want to know which is the worst and the best of that sodas and where can I find references about the this topic. Thanks\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe color of the soft drink may stain teeth. You can test this by soaking eggs in the liquid for a certain period of time. Obviosly the darker colored soft drinks may stain more. If you go on the internet under google, type in \"google scholar\". Then type in a phrase such as staining of teeth by soft drinks; you may get references on this topic.\n\nPlease note: only your personal physician or other health professional you consult can best advise you on matters of your health based on your medical history, your family medical history, your medication history, and how information from any of these databases may apply to you.
