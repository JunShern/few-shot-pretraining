A figure generated with this auto-refreshes the map upon zooming event, and I added some codes to make it refresh data upon panning event, too.\nNow I would like to programmatically change the range of axes without using zoom or pan buttons, but the problem is map is not refreshed automatically. So, I am thinking of generating zooming or panning event programatically, but I haven't found a way to do that.\nAny idea on this?\nLet me elaborate my question.\nIn the 'plot_google_map.m', there is subfunction which is a callback of zooming event.\nfunction plot_google_map  \n% Listen to Zoom events    \nh  = figure(1); plot(1:10);\nhz = zoom(h);\nset(hz,'ActionPostCallback',@mypostcallback);\n\nfunction mypostcallback(obj,evd)\ndisp('Refreshes map data');\n\nWhat I want to do is, to call this subfunction outside the 'plot_google_map'.\nAny idea is welcomed, and thank you for your answers in advance!  \n\nA:\n\nYou heard about the zoom command?\n>> help zoom\n zoom   Zoom in and out on a 2-D plot.\n\nActually it seems that's how the program recognizes you zooming.\n\n"
