    "text": "This is the hazy window into the portion of my mind I choose to reveal. For those who know me, I am a private individual. This journal is mostly Friends Only; If you want to see more entries, add me and comment to let me know, and I probably will add you back.\n\nSo, my sister in law was in town last night, so a group of us went out drinking. We drank for close to 6 hours and ran up a $400+ tab. That's alot of alcohol!\n\nFinally we all started going our separate ways and we ended up in Union Station to put my sis in law on the train home and what do you know, the guy I helped get money for ticket home one morning a couple of days ago was there. And guess what, he had a different story and didn't acknowledge me from before and wanted more money. We confronted him on asking for money the other time and he became rude and started swearing at us. He ended up hoping in a cab to elude us. So much for me feeling good about helping someone out. If I see him again, he's going to take a swim in the river.\n\n::EDIT::Oh, I forgot to mention, I was out of it for most of the day. I think I am finally getting over the drinking binge last night. ;)\n\nThere are some people it just doesnt pay to help. Ive got this thing that if the persn is dressed better than me (i.e. suit or tie or just better threads) I wont give them a dime. If theyre dressed that nice they probly have a debit card or credit card. I really dont give out anything more than a few coins, and thats when Im feeling really generous.\n\nThere are people out there that are professional pan handlers. Youll see them in the same location for a few days or every few days and they jump around locations. Always there during the busy times for that area.\n\nLike down by the dd theres nobody around when I go to work but when the bars are closing theres a ton of people asking for some change for the bus or the train or their baby needs formula or anything. At times I just get sick of it and Ill ask them 20 questions until they get sick of it and leave.\n\nThere is a gal who sits on State Street with a sign that says, \"Student travelling across the country, lost wallet, please help.\" She & her boyfriend live out in the suburbs - apparently one of my friends knows her. Nice little scam.\n\nThere was a couple doing that right outside of the double door about a month ago. There was one guy that sat outsdie of the Milwaukee door every night too. He'd sit there and tell all the people that they had to go around to the Damen door to get in and hed help with load out. The bands would give him a t shirt. But I highly doubt he was a bum. He always told me that he was traveling through the US and hed never ask for money. One of the sound guys even offered to get him dinner or coffee for helping with the load out and he always refused. He must have found a way out of town though cause I never see him anymore.\n\nI hate all beggars, including the ones that put on a vest and claim they're raising money for charity. I'll tip the musicians in the tunnels at O'Hare because I'm getting something for the money.\n\nREALLY hate the ones outside the United Center.REALLY hate the ones that already wreak of booze and give you some sob story.\n\nI remember some newspaper article that said some of those guys clear $300 tax free a DAY. Perhaps I should make a cardboard sign that says \"Unemployed. Please help me keep from losing my house\" and see what happens.\n\nSome people have no shame. I once had a party at my practice spot that was indoor/outdoors. And there was this black chick there slamming down drinks and getting out of hand. Finally I told her she had to go and she claimed that she was a friend of my friend and she was taking care of her. I knew she didnt know her. Turns out she was a bum that crashed the party and I threw her out 4 times and she kept coming back. It got real nasty and not more than 2 weeks later I see her at the train station and she hits me up for bus fare. I said \"HELL, NO!\" and she didn't even recognize me. People are messd up these days."
