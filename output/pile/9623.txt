    "text": "Bioelectrochemical (BEC) systems (e.g., microbial fuel cells, biofuel cells, electrolysis) may have been used in the past for power generation. In the form of microbial fuel cells (MFCs), these systems may have enhanced biodegradation of hydrocarbons, phenol, and other contaminants perhaps while also generating energy. Bioelectrochemical systems may have also been tested in groundwater and sediments for organic carbon removal while generating electricity. A bioelectrochemical system may include an anode, a cathode, and a circuit (perhaps with or without external resistor). For example, in a 2-chambered MFC, microorganisms in the anoxic/anaerobic zone can transfer electrons to the anode, which are then transferred to the cathode. Oxygen may be reduced to water at the cathode, which may produce a current. These types of BECs may separate the anode and cathode by a cation, proton exchange membrane, a salt bridge, or the like to allow protons to transfer between the anode and cathode while minimizing contact of oxygen with the anode. It has been recognized that a floating type cathode combined with an anode system exposing a cathode to air can be used and the water column can complete the circuit.\nNone of the past BEC systems have provided a sustainable and \u201cgreen\u201d method with perhaps little to no load, in the presence or even absence of microorganisms, which may focus solely on enhancing degradation of waste compounds, perhaps organic waste compounds from environments such as water/wastewater, groundwater, and soils/sediments."
