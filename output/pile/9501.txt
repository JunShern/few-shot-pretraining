    "text": "Activity 4: Writing comments \u2013 What you need to know\n\nWelcome to our free professional development series on class and student blogging!\n\nThis series consists of a range of activities that take you through the process of class and student blogging. While many of the class blog examples we\u2019ve included are from primary grades, the same principles apply for class blogs regardless of student age (including adult learners).\n\nThe activities can be completed at your own pace and in any order!\n\nThe aim on this activity is to explain how comments are used on class blogs and to provide tips for teaching students quality commenting skills.\n\nWhy comments are important on class blogs\n\nComments are an important part of your class blog. Comments allow students, and other readers, to engage in discussions, share their thoughts and connect with your class blog. Transforming your blog from a static space to an interactive community.\n\nImportant parts of the blogging process include encouraging students to:\n\n1. Read other students\u2019 posts.\n2. Comment on other students\u2019 posts.\n3. Write posts in response to other students\u2019 posts.\n\nIt\u2019s amazing how even just a few comments can make student realise they are writing for a global audience \u2014 for many it is incredibly motivating.\n\nDiscussions in comments are important for reflective learning . Comments that challenge or suggest alternative options encourage you to reflect, revise, evaluate and review your thoughts.Back to Top\n\nHow comments work\n\nBy default, comments are enabled on all newly created blogs, and a comment form will appear at the bottom of posts and pages where readers can respond to what you\u2019ve written.\n\nHere\u2019s what a comment form looks like:\n\nApproved comments are displayed under the individual post or page. You just click on the post title or the comment link to read the comments.\n\nThreaded comments allow readers to reply to other comments inline/nested which encourages better discussion and responses.\n\nHow to add a comment\n\n1. Click on the heading of the post you wish to comment on or the \u201ccomment\u201d link at the top or at the bottom of the post.\n2. Scroll down until you can see the \u201cLeave a Comment\u201d section\n3. You will be asked for your name (you can use a nickname) and email address (this is not published)\n4. You will also need to write the \u201cspam word\u201d\n5. Click \u201csubmit comment\u201d\n\nReasons why you should teach quality commenting\n\nIf commenting skills are not taught and constantly reinforced, students will limit their comments to things like \u201cI like your blog!\u201d or \u201c2KM is cool!\u201d. While enthusiasm is high with these sorts of comments, students are not developing their literacy skills or having meaningful interactions with other members of the blogging community. Conversations in the comment section of a blog are such rich and meaningful learning experiences for students. Conversations begin with high quality comments.\n\nBlogging is an authentic avenue for developing student literacy skills. When you invest the time in teaching, modelling, revising and promoting high quality writing of comments, students can make great gains in their overall literacy development.\n\nSet your standards high from the start and reap the rewards!Back to Top\n\nHow to teach quality commenting\n\nKathleen teaches commenting skills through:\n\nModelling and composing comments together with students on the interactive whiteboard.\n\nTeaching students about the \u201cletter\u201d format and editing process during writing lessons.\n\nGiving examples of a poor/high quality comments and having students vote whether the comment should be accepted or rejected. Example of a Sorting blog comments activity devised for our students here.\n\nHaving students read and comment on a post on our blog as part of a literacy rotation on the computer each week.\n\nTaking students to the ICT room once a week to work on composing a quality comment with a partner.\n\nEmailing parents and encouraging them to write comments on the blog with their child.\n\nKathleen and her team teacher partner, Kelly Jordan, invests a lot of time focusing on teaching her students how to write \u2018quality comments\u2019 and helping students to understand what quality comments means.\n\nTeaching quality commenting, with constant reinforcement, and setting high standards increases your students literacy skills which provide a good foundation for when you move them onto writing posts on the class blog or their own student blogs.\n\nActivities for developing student commenting skills\n\nHere\u2019s a list of ideas you can use to develop your student commenting skils:\n\nCreate a commenting guideline poster (see poster example below) \u2013 develop your own or facilitate a collaborative discussion with students to create together (you could include this video as part of the process).\n\n2. Why won\u2019t comments display on pages?\n\nMost Edublogs themes now support comments on pages however there are a few themes that don\u2019t.\n\nIf the theme you are using doesn\u2019t support comments on pages, and you would like this feature, then you will need to use an alternative theme.Back to Top3. How do I make comments display on my homepage?\n\nTraditionally comments are designed to be displayed under a post and you view the comments by clicking on the post title or the comments link. It is done this way because posts can have 100\u2019s of comments and displaying them directly under a post on the post page can make it hard to read the content.\n\nHowever, there are a few themes like P2 and ReTweet that display comments directly under posts on the blog post page. These types of themes work well where the posts are short; they work well for Discussion type blogs.\n\nThis is an excellent discussion. The point about making time in class to teach and practice excellent commenting is very important. After all, we must devote time in class to whatever we value.\n\nThis conversation is getting me thinking that there are probably at least three key purposes to teaching commenting: (1) to build classroom community and to show appreciation of peers, (2) to encourage students to follow their intellectual interests on the Internet and to interact with people who share their passions, (3) to teach students the importance of professionalism when publishing their thoughts.\n\n(There are probably many more, of course.)\n\nThinking about those goals, I\u2019m wondering if the approach to Goal #1 vs. Goal #2 might be different. If my main goal is to build classroom community, then how an what I teach is different than if my main goal is to have students interact with fellow bloggers.\n\nAnd this conversation is also getting me to think how the teaching of commenting has changed now that the conversation has moved to other places. What\u2019s an excellent comment on a blog is different than a good tweet.\n\nIt\u2019s all confusing to me but very interesting at the same time! Thank you again.\n\nI think that making productive, relevant comments should definitely be taught and modeled throughout the school year. It is important that students learn to be polite and really edit their comment. One thing that I would teach them is that the reader cannot hear voice inflections or see body language, so the words have to be explicit.\n\nMy students are usually eager to comment back on others posts in the hope that the authors of the post they are comment on will return the visit to their blogs. If I say it is part of their assessment, that will often keep them going. However, if there are no return comments, they can lose interest in the activity and find it easier to just read a post and move on. As I only have my classes once or twice a week (and they are mainly secondary), my class time does not always allow time for students to comment on other blogs. Only the most motivated of students will voluntarily comment back in their own time. Therefore the clustrmaps, flagcounters etc are important to indicate visiting activity on blogs. I like to read many blogs and posts, but due to the time commitment rarely comment now.\nAs an aside and relating to teacher blogs, it was noted by some webinar participants, last night, that there is an increasing lack of comments appearing on many teacher and educationalist blogs, The blogosphere is getting bigger. Many felt that the conversations are continuing on twitter regarding blogs and posts, or as updates on facebook, rather than comments on posts. What do you think?\n\nHi Anne, if we look at teacher and educationalist blogs than getting people to comment has always been hard. It\u2019s perhaps now harder now that it has ever been because the conversations so happen via Twitter, Facebook etc. How people are reading your posts has changed considerably in the past few years. Nowadays posts shared on social networks is considerably more important than RSS. Probably all of this has contributed to changing in commenting. But there is also a skill to writing posts that encourage people to want to post comments. Some bloggers are really good at this. My posts for encouraging comments tend to be totally different from my other posts. Whereas my longer. more informative posts, are less likely to be commented on but more likely to be shared.\n\nYou\u2019ve both timely points for me about lack of commenting, conversations on Twitter, and readers viewing more and so have less time to comment. I can relate to this.\n\nSue, I\u2019m interested to hear more about the skill of writing posts that encourage people to want to post comments; my query is with a class blog in mind. The other day, one of our posts featured on The Head\u2019s Office blog dipping blog and we had 277 visitors . Only one of those visitors left a comment.\n\nHaving just read Activity Three. do you have any tips beyond that on writing posts that encourage comments?\n\nHi Valerie, 4KM and 4KJ @ Leopold Primary School ( http://4kmand4kj.global2.vic.edu.au/ ) is a good example how you write posts on a class blog to encourage comments. If you look closely at the posts you\u2019ll see they structure each post to end with questions that are targeted at asking readers to leave comments. They also spend a lot of time commenting on other class blogs so they\u2019ve built up a relationship of classes that want to interact with them.\n\nThanks for your reply. See my comment 3rd from top for what we already do. From what you\u2019ve just mentioned, it\u2019s good to know we\u2019re on the right track. I was anticipating there might be something further I hadn\u2019t yet discovered.\n\nValerie McLeod\n\n/\n\nAug 11, 2012\n\n/\n\nThinking this through, it is important to teach students the value of commenting, try and give them 10-15 mins each day to do so and how to make those comments count. It was global comments on our first blog posts that got us started in the use of web2.0 tools in our classroom. It was motivating, exciting and some valuable conversations ensued. The younger students do not have access to twitter and other social networking sites, but they can interact through blogging conversations. I like the student blogging challenge where there are teachers dedicated to being mentors. Their trail of comments is extremely valuable. It is the older students where the task to encourage them to comment is so much harder as they prefer to text, update facebook etc If students are taught at a young age will it carry through into senior years, where dedicated time for exploring blogs and commenting is negligible or almost so? That is one of my goals, but I am not successful yet.\n\nHi Anne, I agree! Make commenting part of your class routine. Everyone who is successful does include it as part of the day. Those with limited computer access set up a list next to the class computer where students can go to the computer when they have finished their work, add their comment and then they tick off the name. The other thing is while doing all this look as blogging as part of what you do and not an add on. Integrate your curriculum and what you need to cover into the activities you need to do with the students.\n\nThis really is a quality, comprehensive resource. Also, Mark\u2019s question about reluctant commenters is such a valid one as, like any other learning area, we\u2019ll all have students with commenting skills at both ends of the ability spectrum and in between.\n\nI use blogging and commenting as a key part of our class literacy programme and I view all comments before they\u2019re posted. It not only gives me good information about students\u2019 writing skills but how they\u2019ve responded to a post can give me a good picture of their reading comprehension skills as well.\n\nThis year is my first year with an active class blog that\u2019s integrated into our learning programme. I began the year with the catch-phrase \u201cif we want to get an audience we need to be an audience\u201d. From the beginning I placed emphasis on how to set out a comment, proof reading and answering the questions asked at the end of the post. Initially, I assumed this was enough \u2013 and it was for some who flew straight away (although now we are working on extending their skills). For some students though, and these are the ones that appear to be reluctant and time-wasters, a lot more scaffolding is needed.\n\nI\u2019ve discovered that it\u2019s not that they don\u2019t want to write, respond or engage in a conversation with someone elsewhere in the world. It\u2019s that they simply don\u2019t know what to say. I had spent a reasonable amount of time working with my lower literacy students and doing \u2018shared writing\u2019 of comments; this has been helpful to some. I\u2019m now working with groups of four at a time and this seems to be a lot more effective.\n\nIn working with smaller groups, I can ask questions and receive answers from all members of the group. We seem to have more time to talk and share. I can commiserate if it\u2019s a difficult post to respond to and perhaps spend more time modelling, thinking out aloud, and drawing on my/our personal experiences that we might use in writing the comment. I also use the time to show students how and when to look for more information online.\n\nSince implementing this approach in the last four weeks, I have seen four students commenting skills drastically improve. I am now also attempting to cultivate the habit of being a regular commenter myself.\n\nThis has been valuable for two reasons. Firstly, I can identify with my students as a commenter; we are in this together. Secondly, and possibly most importantly, my students see me as a writer and they are actively having writing modelled to them in an authentic context. I was reviewing one students comment for a student blog post earlier this week and I had to ask him if he\u2019d read the comment I\u2019d written above. He replied, \u201cyes, I wasn\u2019t sure what to write so I read what you had written and got my ideas from that.\u201d I was thrilled, of course, that he\u2019d used his initiative and modelled his writing of an example that was in front of him.\n\nI alleviate the fear of mistakes being published by students saving their comments into their own word document first. I find this has several beneficial aspects to it. It\u2019s a good way to document/keep a record of writing growth, students are accountable for the work they do or don\u2019t do (and if they don\u2019t, how can I help them), I can check content before posting, and I use it as a place to give feedback and feedforward on their writing. It does take regular commitment to do this in a timely way, but it is really just like marking book work.\n\nFinally, following the sage advice of Kathleen Morris, I often begin our day looking at a great comment that\u2019s been added to our blog, something neat on another blog, celebrating our flag counter, or highlighting an instance where another class has linked to our blog. That all helps to keep everyone enthused about blogging.\n\nI\u2019m looking forward to reading tips and tools others use to aid their writers!\n\nOn the one hand, students felt more comfortable writing comments to their peers. On the other, the exercise felt forced. After all, my students felt like they were just writing comments to complete an assignment.\n\nA better approach, I think, is encouraging students to write comments on websites of their choice. This would increase their motivation and their ideas of what to write. I\u2019d first have to make sure that my students are writing quality comments, of course.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\n(After writing this, I think I prefer sticking with the class blog. After all, one of the most important outcomes of commenting is building class community.)\n\nYou raise an interesting point regarding building a class community. I\u2019ve found that the more active we are with our blog, the stronger my students\u2019 sense of class identity is. Our blog and the global \u2018activity\u2019 we have through it is a unique experience for them; it adds a special element to our class.\n\nBoth my class and I have remarked that the extra learning we get through insights into other class\u2019 learning around the world is something we enjoy. I referred to me personally commenting on other blogs in my comment above; this takes time but the rewards for my students (and myself) far outweigh the effort.\n\nMy students are very receptive to other teachers\u2019 comments on our blog, also learn from students\u2019 comments from outside of our class and are learning communication skills beyond what I\u2019ve seen in previous classes. Motivation to write, I think, comes from both the excitement of global interaction and getting to share their own thoughts and views to a real audience.\n\nStudent choice and student voice is important in our blogging. We discuss potential posts, evaluate and decide on which blogs we have on our blog roll and students suggest what should be added to our blog. One recent undertaking is the rewriting of our blog\u2019s blurb; analysing how to increase blog traffic through people searching on Google.\n\nSome time ago, one student couldn\u2019t find a blog post to comment on (on other blogs) so in her own steam wrote a post for our blog about some learning we\u2019d just been doing. That\u2019s another great thing about our class blog; 11-12 year old students wanting to share their learning.\n\nPersonally, I feel that an external audience has a more authentic feel. I do think, though, that it\u2019s important to decide on the outcomes you\u2019re wanting to see, involve your students in the decision-making process, and go for gold.\n\nThanks for sharing what has worked with your students! Having that external audience gives both a more authentic feel and can be so motivating for many students. I also love the advice on involving your students in the decision making process. Very important for personal ownership.\n\nHi Mark, thanks for highlighting the reluctance to comment. Can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t include that in my post \ud83d\ude41 Several years ago I did a 30 day challenge entirely based on commenting with educators and one of the most interesting things that came out of that was the reluctance of the educators themselves to leave comments. In their case time wasn\u2019t the issue. Fear was. All of them were bloggers and had no issues writing posts but were reluctant commenters. When you make a mistake writing a post you can edit or remove; whereas you can\u2019t in most situations with a comment. I\u2019m sure that you\u2019ll find that their reluctance is more to do with that fear than the comments being hidden.\n\nThe key is to look at strategies that will encourage them to engage in commenting. Some educators use comment point systems. I\u2019ll ask my network to see if they can share their tips on what has worked for their class."
