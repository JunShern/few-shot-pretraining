    "text": "Blog dedicated to Street Fighter and Marvel vs. Capcom\n\nMenu\n\nEd officially revealed for Street Fighter 5\n\nCapcom has officially announced the newest Season 2 DLC character for Street Fighter 5, Ed.\n\nClick to see the trailer and additional info.\n\nHere is a more in-depth look on Ed\u2019s V-Skill, V-Trigger, and Critical Art.\n\nV-Skill: Psycho Snatcher\n\nEd releases Psycho Power from his palm, pulling himself or opponents depending on how long he charges it up.\n\nV-Trigger: Psycho Cannon\n\nWith a full V-meter, Ed releases an enormous amount of Psycho Power. He can follow alongside it, allowing him to pepper in shots when it connects with the opponent.\n\nCritical Art: Psycho Barrage\n\nEd lunges forward with a series of punches. If at any point he connects, he\u2019ll continue weaving around the opponent, slipping in quick combinations of Psycho-punches ending with a powerful uppercut.\n\nHere are some stills of the story and premium costumes that are coming with Ed.\n\nI gotta say, I had my doubts about the look, but his fighting style looks pretty cool. Like a mash up of two of my favorite Street Fighter characters, M.Bison and Balrog. He looks like he will play a lot like Balrog, but will also weaves in his version of Psycho Power and kicks. I am really digging how he appears to play.\n\nAesthetically, I\u2019m not a huge fan of the one shoulder pad look, but his story and battle costume look pretty cool. Also, I could have done without another blonde in Street Fighter.\n\nAt about 0:25 seconds in to the trailer, we get a look at Ed\u2019s V-Reversal. It appears to be like Rashid\u2019s where he switches sides.\n\nEd\u2019s V-Skill looks interesting, providing two different ways to close gaps.\n\nIt looks like Ed\u2019s V-Trigger is a lot like Decapre\u2019s from Ultra Street Fighter IV."
