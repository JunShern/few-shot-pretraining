I have two files in the partition: test.txt and innit.eh which results in the following table:\n\nThe entries starting with 0xE5 are deleted, so I assume these were created due to renaming. The entries for the actual files look like this:\nTEST   TXT *snip*\nINNIT  EH  *snip*\n\nWhat I don't understand is where the entries like\nAt.e.s.t......t.x.t\nAi.n.n.i.t.....e.h.\n\nare coming from and what are they for. They do not start with 0xE5, so should be treated as existing files.\nBy the way, I'm using Debian Linux to create filesystems and files, but I noticed similar behaviour on FS and files created on Windows.\n\nA:\n\nThe ASCII parts of the name (where the letters were close to each other) is the legacy 8.3 DOS shortname. You see it only uses capital letters. In DOS, only these would be there.\nThe longer parts (with 0x00 in between) is the long name (shown in Windows) which is Unicode, and uses 16bits per character.\n\n"
