I'm unclear as to why every vertex doesn't have an edge connecting it to every other vertex in the graph - shouldn't all sentences be compared with each other?\nThis doesn't seem to be addressed in the paper. One possible explanation I've produced is that there is no edge if the similarity between two sentences is 0. Does anyone know for sure?\nLink to paper: https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/papers/mihalcea.emnlp04.pdf\n\nA:\n\nAfter getting in touch with the authors of the paper, the reason why every vertex isn't connected to every other vertex in the graph is because only edges with a non-zero weight are added to the graph.\n\n"
