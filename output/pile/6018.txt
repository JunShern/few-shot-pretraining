Would it be even possible for them to clone such repository (or at least by LFS affected files)?\nThis article explains LFS for git in a very nice way (for beginners).\n\nA:\n\nThe technical spec is actually pretty understandable too :\nhttps://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/master/docs/spec.md\ngit lfs replaces the actual files with a text pointer tracked in the git repository :\n\nExample of a v1 text pointer:\nversion https://git-lfs.github.com/spec/v1\noid sha256:4d7a214614ab2935c943f9e0ff69d22eadbb8f32b1258daaa5e2ca24d17e2393\nsize 12345\n(ending \\n)\n\nSomeone without the lfs extension would see these files instead of the expected content, but would otherwise be able to interact with the repository.\n\n"
