ARE YOU TOO BROKE TO MAKE THE META KONOSUBA LIST IN ENGLISH? ARE EVEN THE JP BUILDS TOO EXPENSIVE FOR YOU? YOU\u2019RE SCARED YOUR SET 1 KONOSUBA CARDS WILL ROT IN THE CORNER OF YOUR CLOSET SINCE YOU DIDN\u2019T BUY ENOUGH MAGIC TRAIT CARDS? FEAR NOT, SALTNORI IS GOING TO TEACH YOU THE WAYS WITH THIS NEW DECK DECK PROFILE FROM AN ANON. AND FOR SOME REASON THIS TIME, THIS ENTIRE ARTICLE WILL BE WRITTEN IN ALL CAPS FOR MAXIMUM EDGE.\n\nJokes aside, ALLCAPS is hurting my brain so let\u2019s do this normally. I can\u2019t say for certain but if you basically have all the set 1 cards in this list along with a few of the promos for going out to your locals and actually playing (unlike me who potatos at home), then you\u2019re in for some luck! More than 90% of this build will be from set 1 and the only expensive cards will be at level 3. Plus, this deck will be plenty playable for a budget build.\n\nThe Church of Borden can get things done. And because you can play leafa counters, even if it doesn\u2019t go well, it\u2019s not your fault!\n\nIt\u2019s society\u2019s fault that rogue and budget decks don\u2019t work out!\n\nYou can run away from unpleasant things! That doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve lost! Because sometimes as they say, scooping turn 1 is winning by saving time!\n\nThe answer you figured out after doubting yourself is usually something you\u2019ll regret, no matter what you choose. If you\u2019re gonna eat damage anyway, do whatever\u2019s easiest for you at the moment!\n\nDo not fear growing getting rekt! Not even God knows whether you\u2019re gonna cancel, so you should, at least, be happy now!\n\nERIS PADS HER CHE-\n\n1x DUDE WHO DESERVED THE SP THE MOST\n\n[A] [(1) Discard a card from your hand to the Waiting Room] When this is placed from hand to the Stage, you may pay cost. If so, look at up to 3 cards from top of your Library, choose up to 1 of them and put it in your hand, and put the rest in the Waiting Room.\n\nHoly crap I swear these images looked bigger before I copy pasted them. Anyway, Kazuma is a useful tech for digging and hand-fixing and can be good at any stage in the game as long as you have stock. I should also emphasize that he can grab CLIMAXES or events and DON\u2019T BE THAT PERSON WHO SHOWS WHAT YOU GRABBED AFTERWARDS TO YOUR OPPONENT. Seriously DON\u2019T! Not even axis cult members would do something that stupid.\n\n2x RIPPED CRUSADER WHO SOMEHOW LOSES TO CABBAGES\n\n[C] During your Opponent\u2019s turn, this gains +X Power. X = 4000 times Level of the Character Opposite this.\n\n[A] At the start of your Opponent\u2019s Attack Phase, you may move this to an empty Slot in your Front Row that has an Opponent\u2019s Character Opposite that Slot.\n\nMan, is this not the definition of beautiful design? Not only does this Darkness do exactly what she does in the show but she can also get BIG at certain parts of the game. If you happen to play with people who tend to double/triple field aggressively at level 0, you can actually bamboozle them with this card by running in front of a weaker card they didn\u2019t expect. Mind games people! For that reason, I like cards like this when they come out at turn 2 and beyond to abuse those extra attackers.\n\nMore importantly, this card can potentially dodge on-reverse effects especially during that crucial transition from level 0 to 1 for your opponents when they slam down that climax. During this phase your opponent\u2019s field will be full so as long as you have an open slot you can use this to your advantage! I suggest using this against Yuuki Sinon players (if they still exist that is) for the maximum laughs.\n\n3x CHUUNIBYOU LOLI WHO IS PROBABLY TERRIBLE AT CHESS\n\n[A] Discard a Climax card from your hand to the Waiting Room] When this is placed from hand to the Stage, you may pay cost. If so, choose a Character with either ::Adventurer:: or ::Magic:: in your Waiting Room and return it to your hand.\n\n[A] At the start of your Opponent\u2019s Attack Phase, you may move this to an empty Slot in the Front Row.\n\nI don\u2019t like 1k runner. It\u2019s weak and puny and irritating and it can\u2019t trade everywhere.\n\nHowever this card is an exception since its utility is useful throughout almost all stages of the game. Its ability to turn your climax-filled hand can salvage any relevant character, and by relevant I mean NOT ERIS. My rule of thumb is to always run 4 runners in every build I play if I\u2019m running them at all EXCEPT for maybe Konosuba, because this secondary effect allows you to slot other starting cards without sacrificing too much utility. This goes for outside this deck profile as well, no matter what build (unless it\u2019s themed) I highly suggest running a minimum of 2 these runners if possible.\n\nBut yeah you can\u2019t grab Eris with this effect. Not that its super important or anything because the only Goddess you need in your life is Aqua.\n\n3x HIGH ROLL BRAINSTORM\n\n[C] Your other Character in the Front Row Center Slot gains \u201c[A] ENCORE[Discard a Character card from your hand to the Waiting Room]\u201d.\n\n[S] BRAINSTORM [(1) Rest this] Flip over the top 4 cards of your Library and put them in the Waiting Room. For each Climax card revealed this way, choose up to 1 Cost 0 or lower Character in your Waiting Room and put them in separate Slots on the Stage.\n\nOur first Aqua card features some dank high risk high reward plays. If you\u2019re feeling lucky, you can tap this card and maybe hit a climax to bring out a level 1 to smash your opponent with. At level 0, there are rarely any series that can get above 5k unless they shit out a level 1 at level 0 just like this which makes trading super easy if you pull this off. However, this card is not without its downsides since it can only bring out cost 0 or lower characters. The longer the game goes on, the more you\u2019re going to wish you had a traditional salvage or search brainstorm that adds your target to hand.\n\nHowever, it is also important to remember that Aqua gives hand encore which will be extremely useful for having strong field presence with walls or Early Plays. Aqua sama is a merciful goddess who gives people second chances and your cards deserve that too. For that reason, you should probably put your most important front row cards that you don\u2019t want to lose in the middle so you can use them again next turn.\n\n3x OVERRATED GODDESS WHO IS ACTUALLY FLAT AS MEGUMIN\n\n[A] When this is placed from hand to the Stage, choose 1 of your other Characters with either ::Adventurer:: or ::Goddess::, and that Character gains +1000 Power for the turn.\n\n[A] [Return this to your hand] When your Climax is placed in the Climax Zone, you may pay cost. If so, draw a card, and discard a card from your hand to the Waiting Room.\n\nYes I know, I know\u2026 What the hell is an Eris card doing here? Well the Goddess of Water happens to also give her rivals a chance\u2026\n\nLet\u2019s be honest, unless you\u2019re a new player you already know exactly what kind of level 1 game we\u2019re going to play based on this card alone since it has so much synergy with a specific card. And since this deck profile is meant for most of you folks with existing set 1 Konosuba cards, I\u2019ll do you a favor and spend the least time on Eris as possible :3\n\n3x TOTALLY NOT ERIS\u2019 EARLY PLAY CONDITION OR ANYTHING\n\n[A] [Put a card from your hand in Clock] When this is placed from hand to the Stage, you may pay cost. If so, search your Library for up to 1 ::Goddess:: Character, reveal it, put it in your hand, and shuffle your Library.\n\nOK, I swear we\u2019re playing this card mostly for the ability to search Aqua cards :^)\n\nAlthough it\u2019s not the greatest ability, the option to clock yourself from hand to force level yourself to level 1 is something to keep in mind if you really want to gain a lead on your opponent depending on the circumstances. Alright, and let us pretend like we\u2019re resorting to playing Early Play Eris or something\u2026 Running more copies of this card would allow us to fufill her condition more easily. But surely we wouldn\u2019t do something so blasphemous right?\n\n1x A SET 2 CARD! ABOUT FRICKEN TIME!\n\n[A] When this is placed from hand to the Stage, reveal the top card of your Library. If it\u2019s a Character with either ::Adventurer::, ::Goddess::, or ::Axis Cultist::, put it in your hand and discard a card from your hand to the Waiting Room. (Otherwise put it back where it was)\n\n[A] [(2)] When this is placed from hand to the Stage, you may pay cost. If so, return all cards in your Waiting Room to your Library and shuffle your Library.\n\nOk, so let me get this straight off my chest, you\u2019re not going to have enough stock to be abusing this refresh ability like meta Konosuba so unless you\u2019re reaaaaaaaaaaaally desperate, I would start having second thoughts. However it would be a stretch to say we\u2019re not running this card as a 1-of for that ability since just having the option to do this is really powerful even in the decks that can\u2019t build stock too well. I do have to say that I\u2019ve been saved by this ability many times more than I would like to admit sadly.\n\nOtherwise, this card is quite neat for hand-fixing since unlike Megumin runner, she can actually grab Goddess cards\u2026\n\nWait, are you accusing me again of implying that we\u2019re running this to grab Eris more easily? SMH you\u2019re being delusional. Go eat Axis followers\u2019 soap or something.\n\n3x DANK PROMO YOU GET IF YOU\u2019RE NOT A POTATO\n\n[C] Your other Character in the Front Row Center Slot gains +1000 Power.\n\n[A] This ability activates up to 3 times per turn. When your other Character is placed from the Waiting Room to the Stage, that Character gains +500 Power and \u201c[A] ENCORE [Discard a Character card from your hand to the Waiting Room\u201d for the turn.\n\nA very interesting card indeed since it stacks TONS OF POWER into the middle and gives power to any character that was TURN UNDEAD by Aqua sama. This is quite useful for lvel 1 Eri- I mean, ABUSING any characters that you hit with your lovely Aqua brainstorm that we covered earlier. As long as you have the hand size actually, you can do some neat tricks with cards that resolve their effect when they hit waiting room!\n\nNOW, LET US MOVE ONTO OUR LEVEL 1s!\n\n3x SMASH THAT ABUSE BUTTON FOR AQUA\n\n[A] When this is placed from the Stage to the Waiting Room, you may reveal up to 3 cards from top of your Library. If you reveal at least 1 card this way, choose up to 1 Character among them with either ::Adventurer:: or ::Goddess::, put it in your hand, put the rest in the Waiting Room, and discard a card from your hand to the Waiting Room.\n\nYES, you can combo this card with the PR Aqua you get from just joining your weekly tourneys. When this Aqua hits the waiting room during \u201cencore\u201d step, you can first pay cost and hand-fix/mill through your deck and then just ditch another card to encore this to field. Why you ask? Well if you have the hand size to spare, you can actually use this ability to hand-fix AGAIN when this dies on the swing back and mill through your deck once more. Notice how I specifically said if you have the hand size to spare.\n\nNow, I know what you\u2019re probably thinking. The Aqua brainstorm just isn\u2019t enough reason for you to use this dank strategy because it isn\u2019t consistent enough. Well, about that~\n\n2x SLIMED LOLI THAT ONLY LOLICONS FIND ATTRACTIVE\n\n[A] This ability activates up to three times per turn. When your other Character is placed from the Waiting Room to the Stage, this gains +2000 Power for the turn.\n\nOOOOOOH now we\u2019re really hitting the big power levels. Aqua brainstorm + hand encore strategies allow this card to get stupidly big and run over pretty much anything, even some level 2s! If you stack the abilities, you\u2019re going to be reaching powers big enough to potentially even run over Early Plays!\n\nMan, this card would have been even more hilarious had we gotten standby for this set but then again, standby triggers would have probably made this set potentially a bit too strong\u2026\n\nSo now that you have an idea with what we\u2019re trying to achieve with this deck, what else better cards are there to pair with this gimmick of shitting out cards from the waiting room? Well there\u2019s another Aqua we can use~\n\n3x STACKED GODDESS\n\n[C] If you have another \u2018\u201dTroublemaker\u201d Aqua\u2019, this gains +3000 Power.\n\nJust like how we plan to stack our powers, this Goddess also comes stacked with great ASSETS. BTW, \u201cTroublemaker\u201d Aqua is the brainstorm we play so make sure you have that in the back by the time you play this card\u2026 Although if you haven\u2019t realized it by now, you\u2019re probably summoning this card out of all things with this brainstorm. If you bring it out at level 0, you can be sure this card won\u2019t be dying unless your opponent randomly hits level 1 when you least expected it. Unlike your other two cards, this card reaches a respectable number on defense so it has a higher chance of survival, meaning that\u2019s one less card you have to play from hand potentially next turn.\n\n1x WHAT YOU\u2019LL LOOK LIKE AFTER GETTING FREE STOCK\n\n[C] If there are 3 or fewer cards in your Stock, this gains the following ability. \u201c[A] When the Battle Opponent of this becomes Reversed, you may put the top card of your Library in your Stock.\u201d\n\nThis is a pretty sugoi tech 1 considering you run cards that can search Goddess trait at level 0 without paying stock and a brainstorm that can potentially bring this out early for some dank gainz. Just don\u2019t be that guy who can\u2019t do basic mental math before starting your attack phase and please count your stock.\n\nAny more copies of this is unnecessary since further copies after you get the initial one off is unlikely, as you\u2019ve probably amassed 3 stock or more which downgrades this card into a 5k vanilla. Unless you use your Aqua refresher, chances that you use this again are slim since it\u2019s not worth using up all that stock to get this off again.\n\nWait, you\u2019re STILL not satisfied with our level 1 game? FINE.\n\n4x THE WRONG GODDESS BUT WE HAVE NO CHOICE\n\n[A] When your Climax is placed in the Climax Zone, this gains +1500 Power for the turn.\n\n[A] CX COMBO When \u201cRevive\u201d is placed in your Climax Zone, if this is in the Front Row and you have another ::Goddess:: Character, you may choose a Cost 0 or lower Character in your Waiting Room with either ::Adventurer:: or ::Goddess:: and put it in any Slot on the Stage.\n\nOk, everything was leading up to this point and we just had to put her in. She procs your PR effect for the dank hand encore and attack buff stacking and just has perfect synergy with her level 0 that bounces to hand as it creates space for her to summon a character from waiting room. Furthermore, she makes your Megumin level 1 get STUPIDLY big. She also allows you to play less characters from hand since you\u2019re going to summon them from waiting room anyway.\n\nShe even lets you play a character from waiting room over your on-death mill/hand-fix Aqua which you can technically use to proactively go through your deck.\n\nLet\u2019s be real though, because she is ERIS she must have her downsides right? Well there definitely are more than one. She doesn\u2019t exactly give plusses to hand and the combo feels very underwhelming without her level 0 bounce to hand. While she doesn\u2019t have to reverse to net you plusses, she\u2019s also a glass cannon and 100% going to die on the swingback unlike ASTOLFOPHA.\n\nShe\u2019s also more useful depending on the time she\u2019s fielded, aka 2 Eris which will give you either a front row attacker and some backrow but the problem issometimes you\u2019ll already have your backrow ready by the time you hit level 1. This causes an issue since you want to ideally field her in multiples for maximum gainz and if you already have 2 backrow slots that means fielding 2 Eris is MUDA. This is something I dislike greatly since I believe one should be rewarded for being able to set up for their level 1 game instead of the opposite. Just look at our pretty boi, when he successfully triple fields he gets u like 10 cards in hand!\n\nRegardless of these issues, we should still play Eris because all our cards basically have high synergy with her and she will get the job done. Although I have yet to introduce the biggest downside\u2026. YOU\u2019RE PLAYING ERIS INSTEAD OF AQUA!\n\nAND NOW, IT IS TIME FOR OUR LEVEL 2 GAME. OH WAIT, BUT WHAT IF I TOLD YOU THERE WERE NO LEVEL 2S IN OUR ROSTER?\n\nOk then, let\u2019s introduce some 3s that actually comprise of our level 2 game\u2026\n\n1x AQUA THAT MIGHT TOO TOO EXPENSIVE FOR YOU SO WE LIMITED HER NUMBER\n\n[C] If you have 4 or more Characters with either ::Adventurer::, ::Goddess::, or ::Axis Cultist::, this gets -1 Level while in your hand.\n\n[C] During your turn, if all your Characters are either ::Adventurer::, ::Goddess::, or ::Axis Cultist::, this gains +2000 Power.\n\n[A] [Discard a card from your hand to the Waiting Room] When this is placed from hand to the Stage, you may pay cost. If so, put the top card of your Clock in your Stock.\n\nHmmm if this card eventually spiked to 2480 yen to 3280 and fluctated there in JP\u2026 Chances are it\u2019ll be even more expensive in English so let\u2019s be merciful to our wallet for the sake of our sanity.\n\nThis card is great mostly for one reason; its condition to be played early. It\u2019s stupidly easy to play it down from hand. Otherwise, it\u2019s actually not that great\u2026 It dodges anti-heal which was really neat and it basically means it was a 3/1! But the problem is it will almost always die on the swingback due to being a measly 9k base.\n\nAnd before you guys start yelling at me NO SALTNORI IF THIS CARD IS SO BAD WHY WAS IT SO EXPENSIVE, well let me tell u folks why.\n\nIn meta Konosuba, you didn\u2019t really care if it died on the swing back. You had so many resources and stock that you could just play another copy of this down on the turn after and feel like nothing happened. This card was basically ABUSABLE.\n\nIn this deck however, it certainly isn\u2019t and most importantly our wallets cannot sustain the damage it will do to our bank account. However, what\u2019s neat is that we have a lot of hand encore we can use thanks to our level 0-1 game so just put this in the middle and you can just ditch 1 card in hand to basically use it again on the next turn. Pretty neat eh? Instead our main level 2 game will feature a not-as-cool Goddess\u2026\n\n3x I LIED TO YOU GUYS WE\u2019RE PLAYING HER\n\n[C] If \u2018\u201dMeaning for Killing Snow Sprites?\u201d Aqua\u2019 is in your Clock, this gets -1 Level while in your hand.\n\n[A] When this is placed from hand to the Stage, you may choose a Character with either ::Adventurer:: or ::Goddess:: in your Waiting Room and return it to your hand.\n\n[A] [(1) Discard 2 cards from your hand to the Waiting Room] This ability activates up to once per turn. When your Character in the Front Row Center Slot attacks, you may pay cost. If so, reveal the top card of your Library. If it\u2019s a Character with either ::Adventurer:: or ::Goddess::, Stand this. (Put the revealed card back where it was)\n\nAhh\u2026 THIS FUCKING CARD. I HATE IT. I ABSOLUTELY FUCKING HATE IT. BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN WE SHOULDN\u2019T PLAY IT. It fits our game plan just so well and in specific scenarios, you can do that good ol\u2019 strategy of killing your opponent while you\u2019re at level 2.\n\nLet me do this real quick though as I have built up a lot of salt from whiffing with this card\u2019s finishing cost. For this, let\u2019s put a montage of sad reacts only for all the games I literally had in my reach that I lost because this evil Goddess revealed a climax since I\u2019m apparently too compressed for this game. In fact, I should be punished for reaching otherwise a good deck state in every other deck.\n\nThis one is for that one time I lost in top 8 regionals thanks to Eris\n\nThis one is for every time I was denied store credit because Eris lost me the game\n\nThis one is for Alonne who I was stuck on for several weeks. Great boss fight btw.\n\nAnd this one is because I didn\u2019t pull Mordred on FGO and she would certainly be useful for farming cheesecakes atm in the Christmas Event IF I HAD HER. FUCK YOU GATCHA\n\nNow that the salt is mostly gone, let\u2019s remember the other 50% of the time where I absolutely destroyed people with this card. For the sake of saving time, I shall let u click a video that essentially summarizes my feelings.\n\nS S S STYLISH!\n\n2x NOT ERIS BUT SOME THIEF\n\n[A] When this is placed from hand to the Stage, you may put the top card of your Clock in the Waiting Room.\n\n[A] When this attacks, choose 1 of your other ::Adventurer:: Characters, and that Character gains +X Power for the turn. X = 500 times # of your other ::Adventurer:: Characters.\n\n[A] [(1) Discard 2 Character cards from your hand to the Waiting Room] When this attacks, you may pay cost. If so, look at up to 3 cards from top of your Opponent\u2019s Library, choose up to 3 of them and put them in the Waiting Room, return the rest to the Library and shuffle that Library.\n\nAhhhh running 2 of these almost reminds me of the JP ratios that keep coming up in topping lists. This is quite useful as a yellow splash and a healer finisher that can help against opponents that have reached dank compression levels. If you\u2019re opponent is looking smug and acting cocky as if they\u2019d already won, you should probably get this card ready in hand so you can tell them to basically piss off.\n\nOther than that, this is also another healer that can help you live longer. It also has that nice attack pump that can help Eris get over cards so in the case you are against Standby SAO or something, you won\u2019t get memory kicked to oblivion and can maybe get your re-stand off.\n\n4x HEALER FINISHER THAT DESERVED LN ART FOR HER FOIL\n\n[A] When this is placed from hand to the Stage, you may put the top card of your Clock in the Waiting Room.\n\n[A] CX COMBO [(1)] When this attacks, if \u201cFirst Time Feeling Uplifted\u201d is in the Climax Zone, you may pay cost. If so, choose 1 of your Characters, and that Character gains +2000 Power and the following ability for the turn. \u201c[A] This ability activates up to once per turn. When the Damage dealt by this is Cancelled, you may deal 2 Damage to your Opponent.\u201d (Damage Cancel can occur)\n\nAhhhhh more healers. I looooooooove healers. I know that some of you guys don\u2019t but damn I love them. On the other hand, had this card NOT been a Darkness card and it didn\u2019t heal, I wouldn\u2019t like this card as much.\n\nPaying 1 for a cancel burn2 isn\u2019t necessarily bad since it\u2019s cheap but it\u2019s not great either when you compare it to other healer finishers like Yukina that have high damage output. I\u2019ve had games where some guy just takes the damage and I\u2019m like wow I wish I didn\u2019t have a cancel burn.\n\nWhat is neat though is that you\u2019re able to stack these burns onto Eris, who if able to get off her re-stand, will most likely do tons of damage to your opponent. As long as Eris survives her level 2 game (which you can also technically hand encore), you only have to play stock for 1-2 of these to pull off your endgame which is honestly not bad as long as her re-stand succeeds. Now getting off that re-stand is the hard part, but let\u2019s be real\u2026 it\u2019s hella exciting. It\u2019s almost like playing Dark Souls again\u2026\n\n10/10 right?\n\nCLIMAXES:\n\n4x MASOCHISTIC ORGASMS\n\n4x BOOK INTO A BOOK\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS AND SOME THINGS I WANT TO SAY ABOUT SET 2\n\nFirst of all, thank you guys for reading these deckprofiles and more importantly, thank you to the anons who always send them in. They\u2019re always fun to review and talk about and I appreciate them a lot. I think it\u2019s great to also give back to the community in this form of entertainment since it\u2019s not just only fun for you guys but it\u2019s hella entertaining for me even if I\u2019d rather be playing FGO most of the time\u2026\n\nOnce again, this deck is a budget build that anyone with a lot of set 1 Goddess/yellow cards can improve with a few set 2 cards. There are some things however that I would like to add since they could substantially improve the deck if you\u2019re willing to shell out more $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$\n\nThis Aqua Fumio has been getting only better over time and holy crap she is nuts in the Meta build. Unsurprisingly, she would also be great in this deck too since pulling off her effects will make your re-stands stick more\u2026 as long as you don\u2019t reveal those climaxes!\n\nANOTHER ERIS CARD. I KNOW. However, for the low cost of 1 stock you can bottom deck troublesome Early Plays and it\u2019s well worth it especially since you play lots of cards that can fetch Goddess trait. Her first effect is pretty niche but you can do it sometimes too.\n\nThis card is quite decent if there are no AOT players around\u2026 And due to the current English Meta this Aqua shouldn\u2019t be too expensive. As long as you get 1 reverse off, you can easily plus up to 3 which replenishes the stupid amounts of cards in hand that Eris Early Play consumes. The real problem is that you\u2019re probably playing 8 of these 2 soul triggers which I ABSOLUTELY DETEST even more than whiffing Eris.\n\nUndoubtedly one of the best cards in the set. The big issue stopping this from being in this deck is that it\u2019s another potential whiff for Eris. If you do happen to be a person with BIG BALLS or you switch Eris out for another level 2-3 game, please put 2-3 of these in. It will absolutely turn the tide of certain matches.\n\nI can make more suggestions but you\u2019re probably getting bored of them so let me end with this. Set 2 Konosuba is stupidly expensive if you\u2019re making the meta deck but it doesn\u2019t have to be that way. You can make a fun, playable deck such as this and it can honestly net surprising wins in tourneys as long as you reveal those climaxes. So don\u2019t let that stop you from killing your wallet\u2026\n\nAND DON\u2019T FORGET.\n\nERIS PADS HER CHEST!"
