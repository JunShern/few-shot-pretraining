    "text": "Coming to an Inner-City Near You: \u201cUltimate Future Riot Control Truck\u201d (Video)\n\nMake no mistake about it, the elites don\u2019t care about you. To them, we are nothing more than cogs in the machine that they control, and if a cog steps out of line, it must be disposed of. Of course, with societal oppression comes riots and uprisings, and the elites are always scoping out for the latest technology to keep the proletariat docile and under control. If the proletariat gets violent however, they have a new weapon to bring forward \u2013 the ultimate riot control truck.\n\nIn the following video, Right Wing News looks at this frightening dystopian level technology and the implications behind its use. It\u2019s fully remote controlled and comes with a 3-ton shield that can also act as a bulldozer. Up to 36 riot police can hide behind the shield. And of course there are the standard high pressure water cannons and tear gas guns. Is it only time before these trucks become commonplace in our city streets?\n\nOne upon a time, the benevolent future was supposed to bemuse with hoverboards, flying cars and interplanetary travel. Instead, according to the folks at Slovakia\u2019s Bozena Riot Security Systems, the dystopian future has arrived, and it is made of armored plates and riot gear.\n\nThe Bozena Riot can handle virtually any duty when authorities need to put down an uprising: it is a remotely operated, armored vehicle designed to deal with riots and mobs in the streets and urbanized areas. The system offers a solution for both protecting the law-enforcement units in action and controlling the situation whenever peace maintenance is required.\n\nThe truck right out of RoboCop\u2019s OCP Detroit, has three components: a carrier, a 3000 kg adjustable shield, and a water trailer. Two water cannons can send protesters flying from the front or the rear and if that doesn\u2019t do the trick, police can always rely on the \u201chigh-pressure tear gas gun\u201d to disperse any riot.\n\nAs Gizmodo points out, the unmanned unit is covered in CCTV cameras assuring full video coverage, while the driver gets to enjoy inner-city riots from a comfortable safe distance courtesy of this virtual cockpit which puts all control options at one\u2019s fingertips:\n\nThe truck\u2019s shield has six launching ports to fire guns or other rubber projectile launchers while keeping the heavily fortified shooters safe. Furthermore, should the truck\u2019s riot police passengers get stuck in an alleyway, the shield has bulldozing capabilities allowing authorities to directly engage with social discontents.\n\nTo be sure, the topic of police militarization in the US has been a particularly sensitive one in recent years, so perhaps the country will avoid this tool to quickly and efficiently restore post-riot order. Probably not: as Gizmodo notes, \u201cthe combination of an increase in law enforcement spending and Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 pledge to stop monitoring out-of-control police departments seems to set up just the right environment to make it happen.\u201d\n\nIn any case, no matter on which side of the ideological divide one stands, and whether one roots for the authorities or the rioters who may soon suffer the wrath of the Bozena Riot, there are plenty reasons for everyone to be both delighted and concerned.\n\nUntil we look like Venezuela the progressive democratic regime will not stop programming the public through the MSM to continue to riot over the most ridiculous of excuses. If these protestors think they are not victims of propaganda programming, they have only to put the shoe on the other foot to see they lack any justification requiring such a response. Soon they will be fighting for their lives and betraying their friends to survive and acquire the simplest of basics. George Soros and the progressive party just love referring to these Professors, students and inner city malcontents as \u201cUseful idiots\u201d. Unless they start looking at both sides of whatever they think their cause is, I can only hope their road to starvation is not a painful one."
