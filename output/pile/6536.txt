I can no longer stretch the window to any resolution.  It is locked at 1024x768 in the guest window (Ubuntu).  For sanity, I re-installed The Linux Guest Additions.  I also tried uninstalling it and reinstalling it even though the script does this for you.  No matter what, I can't get past the limited 1024x768 workspace.  Furthermore, I noticed that xorg.conf is not in the /etc/X11 folder but I believe this is normal as my other PC running a similar setup also does not have xorg.conf yet scales the guest window of Ubuntu properly to any resolution (including true full screen mode).\nI have set the guest settings to 64MB video space and also tried 128MB.  No difference there.  I also tested running Virtualbox 4.1.8 (to try an older working version).  Nothing.  Now I am back to Vbox version 4.1.12 with no avail.\nI am also unable to run the Ubuntu Desktop with advanced effects.  Maybe the Linux Guest Additions is not running even though it is installed?  How do I verify this?\nAny other suggestions?\n\nA:\n\ntry with this:\n1. Open terminal and enter the following command: \n\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r)\nsudo apt-get install virtualbox-ose-guest-x11 \n\n2. Once installation is finished, restart your virtualBox machine. \n\n3. Go to System -->Preferences -->Monitors and change the resolution of your screen.\n\nsource:\nhttp://tutorial.downloadatoz.com/how-to-fix-ubuntu-10-10-virtualbox-guest-additions-problems.html\n\n"
