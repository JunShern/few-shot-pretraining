    "text": "Every week PCGamesN recount the highest performing titles on Valve\u2019s platform, from the ten Steam top sellers to the Steam games with the most concurrent players. Why? Because knowing what games people are flocking to is useful for discovering new titles and reminding us of the ones we really ought to have tried by now.\n\nThe first portion of this weekly roundup focuses on Steam sales \u2013 that is to say the games and DLC that are selling like proverbial hot cakes. We pull these entries from the Steam store itself, under the global top sellers page. The second part of our Steam charts rundown looks at concurrent players, which gives us some insight into the most played games of the past week.\n\nThis week sees No Man\u2019s Sky take top spot, not to mention two Sword Art Online games in the top ten best-sellers. The good news doesn\u2019t stop there for No Man\u2019s Sky either, which also grabs a spot in the most played games on Steam. Join us as we list the top ten games for each category along with a brief analysis of the week\u2019s biggest surprises.\n\nSteam top sellers\n\nHere are the Steam top sellers, week ending July 27th:\n\nNo Man\u2019s Sky\n\nPUBG\n\nMonster Hunter: World\n\nGTA 5\n\nMonster Hunter: World Deluxe Edition\n\nVampyr\n\nRocket League\n\nCSGO\n\nSword Art Online: Hollow Realization Deluxe Edition\n\nSword Art Online: Fatal Bullet\n\nPUBG has been pushed to second place this week thanks to the highly anticipated No Man\u2019s Sky NEXT update, which adds what many thought would be in the game from the start: multiplayer. It\u2019s also 50% off, so it\u2019s not too surprising the 2016 space game is having a resurgence. Third and fifth spot are occupied by Monster Hunter: World and its Deluxe Edition \u2013 that\u2019s three weeks on the trot that pre-orders for Monster Hunter: world have placed in the Steam charts so Capcom must be pretty happy with their decision to bring the series to PC. GTA 5 is nestled between the two; it\u2019s selling strongly off the back of a major Online update and 34% price reduction.\n\nVampyr takes sixth place thanks to a delectable 25% off sale, which is enough to place it higher than chart stalwarts Rocket League and CS:GO, which grab seventh and eighth spot respectively. The final two places go to Sword Art Online: Hollow Realization Deluxe Edition and Sword Art Online: Fatal Bullet \u2013 the former is 50% off, while Fatal Bullet boasts a 40% price reduction.\n\nSteam charts by concurrent players\n\nHere are the most played games on Steam, week ending July 27th:\n\nPUBG\n\nDota 2\n\nCS:GO\n\nGTA 5\n\nWarframe\n\nRainbow Six Siege\n\nNo Man\u2019s Sky\n\nTeam Fortress 2\n\nFootball Manager 2018\n\nArk: Survival Evolved\n\nNo major surprises here besides No Man\u2019s Sky, which was played for 1,100,942 hours in one day, which goes some way to showing just how badly people wanted multiplayer in the game. Other than that, PUBG reigns supreme, just like it always does, and all the games we\u2019d expect to see are present.\n\nTo see how these figures compare to last week\u2019s check out the Steam charts for week 29, 2018. So, there you have it, these are the games people are buying and playing right now \u2013 perhaps it\u2019ll help you find your next timesink."
