    "text": "Roland SH09\n\nRoland SH09\n\nwas a smaller version of the SH2, only one VCO and small size. nice on stage. one VCO, ENV, subosc and PWM, one LFO, but still enough for basses and stuff, it's not really a monophonic juno 6 but sort of.. looks like the sh2 but one VCO lost\n\nUser Comments\n\nI purchased a SH-09 at a used gear shop for $350. The only cool thing about it is that it's analog. The sound capability is very limited. It's sound is very distinct, but that is it's main downfall. It can't produce any wild ARP-2600 type sounds. Although, I have heard this synth on some recent recordings including Meat Beat Mainfesto.\n\nI have a roland sh-09. I got it for 50 bux and it is in very nice shape. I run the sh-09 through a digitech rp-3 and it really gives the ol' synth a breth of new life but you still can't beet that old anolog sound the sh-09 give. and I will more then likely take mine to the grave with me\n\nthis is one of the most easy to use synths I have ever seen. and it puts out a really nice sound. The sh-09 is in my mind about as good if not better then a minimoog I'll catch a lot of flack for saying that but oh well. Roland really hit the nail in the head with this synth and I really wish every one coul have the chance to play one cause there wonderfull. I have my SH-09 playing in to a digitech RP-3 ( for a little FX) and I use a Marshel amp all in all I would say that once it warms up (it's analog) it's a really nice synth. and watch out for the plastic panle that the bender is on, it has a nasty habbit of braking (and or cracking). but I just love the little unit it's compact and easy to use and it gives the classic analog fuzz )\n\nthe sh09 is a pretty popular machine in analogue circles, not least because there are so many of them floating about, a sign that they were popular when thet came out originally.For a one oscillator synth the 09 is pretty cool especially as there are no specialist Ics inside for the vco and filter.(specialist chips such as the CEMand SSM chips all had a particular sound which meant that most synths sounded similar)The Vcf is especially cool,a very phat 24db self oscillating beast which can filter external audio.It is made up of four operational Transconductance amplifiers and a whole bunch of discreet components,which make it sound typically Roland but yet not quite as you expect. Sonically the 09 comes into its own when used with a sequencer,I use mine with a home made linear device which can scale up to 12vThat is to say thay it can switch between 0.5v or so right up to 12v ,covering the whole of the synths audio range .When this is used it gives some very wierd atmospheric and very wild analogue sounding sounds, that have to be heard to be believed!For this reason alone the 09 with all its short comings is well worth investigating. Mine cost me \u00a340 five years ago and Ive been tempted to sell it once but I decided that It and I shouldnt really ever part!\n\nI have an SH-2, which is similar to the SH-09 but with an extra oscillator, some extra keys, etc. But I think it\u00b4s important for any electronic musician to know that Vince Clarke had an SH-09 on the top of his rack, in the Cowboy tour, only for basses. That means something...\n\ni am a bit confused, cause i know the sounds of my sh 09 are awesome BUT it gets totally out of tune : ( with this detune problem i cannot go out and play live with it ... Does someone over here had the same problem and what should or can i do about it ? ?\n\nIf you imagine a really pissed off robot of epic dimensions - one which has gone haywire and is crushing puny humans and stamping buildings underfoot. Now if you imagine that robot shouting at top volume, then that's the sound of the Roland SH09.\n\nThis is an ideal introduction to analogue synthesis. Within a fairly short period of time, it becomes very easy to dial in new patches and quickly get the sound you want. The synth is only monophonic and is of a relatively small size, but don't let that decieve you. The sound quality is awesome - I run this through my Marshall amp and have had it mic'd up and blasting out a big PA before: the tone and volume on this tiny beast was insane.\n\nI love this synth to bits. It is capable of a lot more than most people would assume, and if you run it through an effects processor, you can get close to any sound you want. As someone already rightly commented, the only limitations are those of the musician.\n\nI'm deeply and utterly in love with my sh-09, but years of touring and gigging have left it looking a bit battered and bruised. worse, though, it is currently around three semitones out of tune. anyone know any tips for keeping it in tune? also, anyone link there's to an organ strings 09? know how this is done? good sounds? any tips for getting the sounds of the sh09 with improved reliability massively appreciated......."
