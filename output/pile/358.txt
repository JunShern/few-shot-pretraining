These printable diagrams are designed to guide you in studying the structure and anatomy of throat. The throat is what we use to swallow and gulp anything placed inside the mouth. Throat begins at the back of our mouth and ends in the upper part of the stomach. There are three parts of our throat: the upper part, the middle part and the lower part called as nasopharynx, oropharynx and laryngopharynx respectively. To see the illustration of those parts, take a look at the following throat diagram.\n\nSponsored links\n\nimage via www.anatomylibrary.us\n\nIn the throat diagram above, there are many organs inside our throat. Each organ located in the three parts of the throat. The pharynx is the upper part of the airway and begins at the back of the nasal passages and proceeds to the top of the oesophagus. It is generally considered to be part of both the respiratory tract and the digestive tract. It is the visible part seen when you open the mouth. Meanwhile, the larynx is a tube made of muscles and cartilages and carrying air from the nose and throat toward the trachea. Larynx is also known as voice box without which you cannot speak or sing. Larynx is located about 5 inches below the pharynx of the throat. For more understanding, look at the following printable diagrams.\n\nimage via www.imgarcade.com\n\nimage via www.readtiger.com\n\nimage via www.fineartamerica.com\n\nTrachea is commonly called as windpipe and it transports air from the larynx till the bronchioles of the lungs. You can also see the esophagus which has the main function to empty the food particles received from the pharynx into the stomach. In the following images, we also have the blank version of the diagram that you can use as a quiz sheet.\n\nimage via www.hisherscomm.com\n\nimage via www.akitarecuepftulsa.com\n\nimage via www.studyblue.com\n\nAll these pictures are printable and you just need to click on the image to enlarge and save it.
