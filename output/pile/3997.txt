It seems that Florida\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s recent efforts to conduct a thorough review of their voter rolls and purge the ineligible or the \u201a\u00c4\u00b6 er\u201a\u00c4\u00b6 dead, have drawn the Attorney General. And what might the Department of Justice have to say about this record-keeping audit? Clearly, this has to be stopped.\n\nNo, but you can make up who's being purged.....calling them the \"dead\" when you're really going after the \"non-citizens.\"\n\n- 1638 people in Miami-Dade County were flagged by the state as \u201a\u00c4\u00fanon-citizens\u201a\u00c4\u011a and sent letters informing them that they were ineligible to vote.\n\n- Of that group, 359 people have subsquently provided the county with proof of citizenship.\n\n- Another 26 people were identified as U.S. citizens directly by the county.\n\nThe situation in Miami-Dade is also apparent in elsewhere in Florida. According to a local reports in smaller Polk County of the 21 voters flagged by the state \u201a\u00c4\u00fanine appear to be citizens, leaving 12 as questionable.\u201a\u00c4\u011a\n\nAmerica still has those poor Muslims locked up in cages like wild animals down in Gitmo and Beautiful Long Legged Jug Ears is killing hundreds of innocent people with his \"Wonderful Drones\" is it any wonder the Jug Ear crowd doesn't care about \"Voter Fraud\" they know all the sh!tbums that don't have ID's will Vote For \"Their Messiah\" Obama is sure to get \"The Wino Vote\"\n\nBefore you start a new thread, please take the time to check and see if a similar thread has already recently been posted.

I'm not kidding, there's 4 active threads right now that I can't access because agent 13 has decided that the rules don't apply to me. There's some secret set of rules out there somewhere that define how I'm supposed to act.\n\nI think I've got one secret rule figured out though. Kiss enough mod azz and you can pretty much get away with everything Harry gets away with.\n\nWhat's funny is that this statement would get me kicked out of this thread.

The people in Florida are reaching out to verify that people still belong on the rolls. If they just removed people when there was a question of them still being on the rolls THAT would be wrong.\n\nReaching out to make sure people aren't removed in error is the responsible thing to do and should be applauded.\n\nHere's a question for those who think that Florida is doing the right thing by \"purging\" the registration lists....\n\nHow come, if it's supposed to be about \"dead\" people, 58% of the names being purged are of Hispanic origin but Hispanics only make up 13% of Florida's registered voters?\n\nAbout 58% of those flagged as potential noncitizens are Hispanics, Florida\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s largest ethnic immigrant population, a Miami Herald analysis found. Hispanics make up 13 percent of the overall 11.3 million active registered voters.\n\nWait a minute, are you accusing PF13 of arbitrary and capricious moderating?\n\nIf so: I agree with you wholeheartedly.

Patters prefers that there be nothing but partisan bullschit being tossed about in here and agent 13 can't win any arguments if he has to stay honest.\n\nThere was a time when the two of them didn't work so hard to drive away civil conversation. I actually came away from here smarter than when I entered back in the day. Those days are long, long since over though. Now Harry is considered a top-contributing poster.
