    "text": "Acura is about to undergo a dramatic renaissance. For several years this brand has soldiered on with some gaping holes in its line-up \u2014 RL anyone? (Yeah, that hole is so big it echoes.) In some senses, it is a brand without a flagship because the flagship sedan is so overlooked that it might as well not exist. It doesn\u2019t have any coupes (unless you count the ZDX crossover. I know, that was a reach), sports cars, hybrids or diesels and its entry-level sedan doesn\u2019t even offer the brand\u2019s excellent AWD system.\n\nAcura sales were down almost 12 per cent in Canada last year (and down about 25 per cent since 2007), though no one can accurately say how much the tsunami in Japan affected the parts supply chain and production capacity, despite most Acura models being produced in North America. Speaking of production, the MDX and ZDX are produced right here in Canada at Honda\u2019s Alliston, Ontario plant. With CSX production winding down and the RL, TSX and ZDX models sales faring poorly, Acura became predominantly a truck seller, with the MDX and RDX accounting for over half of its vehicles sold in Canada last year.\n\n2012 Acura MDX Elite. Click image to enlarge\n\nBut the future is bright. Acura just debuted the NSX concept at the Detroit Auto Show, and despite the lack of an interior, it is a convincing reinterpretation of the seminal Acura supercar, abiding by the mid-engine layout, exotic, supercar-worthy design, and application of Honda hybrid technology and all-wheel-drive as befitting the Acura brand. Alongside the NSX, Acura introduced the second generation RDX and upcoming ILX compact luxury sedan, which will put them back on the map with entry-level luxury shoppers looking for a small car or crossover.\n\nOn the sedan side, the TSX and TL are both standouts offering warm performance and exceptional value that keep people coming back to the Acura brand, though controversial styling may be hurting their adoption rate. Without question, the greatest strength in the Acura line-up for several years has been the MDX SUV, with sales consistently topping 5,000 units annually for the past 5 years. It may be odd that Honda\u2019s luxury brand has been anchored by a mid-size SUV considering Honda\u2019s reputation is rooted in small, efficient cars, but the MDX is to the luxury SUV market what the Fit is to small cars: efficient packaging ahead of its time, strong and nimble performance \u2014 yet economical to run \u2014 and good value even if it might not win the feature-per-dollar contest. The MDX may not have anything as brilliant as the Fit\u2019s Magic Seats, but it came to market with three rows of seating without bloating into a full-size SUV, which served to make it a reasonable solution to a wide variety of tastes and needs.\n\n2012 Acura MDX Elite. Click image to enlarge\n\nThen again, taste is one area that Acura wasn\u2019t afraid to experiment with, and while many lambasted Acura\u2019s various grille and trunk treatments, the MDX has resonated with high-income households looking for one car that fits all needs or as a luxury winter carry-all. A recent trip through Forest Hill, one of Toronto\u2019s most affluent neighbourhoods, and I was crossing paths with MDX models of various generations at practically every turn and intersection. Granted, that\u2019s a fairly limited sample, but it\u2019s worth far more to Acura to have MDXs in a handful of those driveways (or better yet, at the school drop-off) than any number of reviews on a site even as esteemed as this one.\n\nPersonally, I find the current grille a little blas\u00e9 compared to the 2007\u20132009 model years, with its twin, perforated grille shields, but I have to give Acura credit for consistency across the line-up and finding a look that works from compact sedan all the way up to its SUVs. Once you get past the grille, the angular headlights may not sport the latest LED gimmickry (though I\u2019m sure it\u2019s coming soon), but they suit the sharply creased edges and even proportions that make this SUV seem much smaller than its 4,867 mm length (longer than either the 4,807-mm Volvo XC90 or 4,829-mm Land Rover LR4).\n\nThat length helps accommodate the third row of seats and 425 litres of cargo even with all seats up and 1,215 litres behind the second row, compared with 249 litres and 615 litres for the XC90, or 280 litres and 1,192 litres for the LR4. Max cargo volume with all seats flat is 2,364 litres for the MDX, to the XC90\u2019s 1,837 and the LR4\u2019s 2,558. Overall, utility definitely goes to the MDX (power tailgate as base equipment, thank you very much, Acura), although it should be noted that the third row is not a comfortable option for full-size adults in any of these SUVs.\n\nAlthough by no means unique to this segment, I always feel the need to share when seats are at an ideal height for easy installation of car seats and insertion of children into said car seats for both me and my vertically-challenged wife. Our two-year-old daughter\u2019s favourite feature was the rear entertainment system that meant another week of Barbie and Leap Frog movies whenever we drove anywhere. (It should also be noted that if I never have to listen to another Barbie movie again, it will be too soon. Unfortunately, I likely have many years of Barbie movies and accessories in my future, no doubt.)"
