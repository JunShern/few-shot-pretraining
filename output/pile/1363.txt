To dabble in the world of e-sports, well, only a select few will be able to make a good living out of it, and afterwards as well when they have retired. Still, if you would like to give those restless thumbs and fingers of yours a go, how about checking out the Mortal Kombat eSports tournament that boasts of a $500,000 prize pool?\n\nAdvertising\n\nHalf a million in cold, hard cash, now that is certainly pretty difficult to turn down, don\u2019t you think so? Warner Bros. would be the one behind this prize money as they launch the massive Mortal Kombat X eSports program later next month April, with the prize pot being a mouth watering $500,000. This particular venture will also include the third season of ESL Mortal Kombat X Pro League, which will see the cream of the crop from around the world go up against one another this April 3rd.\n\nAs for the top sixteen players, they will then stand a chance to compete in front of a live audience when June 12 rolls around, while the final eight finalists will be able to duke it out for a slice of the $200,000 from the prize pot. This is because Warner Bros. will host tournaments throughout North America, Europe, the Russian Commonwealth and Latin America at the same time.\n\nFiled in . Read more about Mortal Kombat.
