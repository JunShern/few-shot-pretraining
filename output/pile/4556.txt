    "text": "THE IRISH GREYHOUND Board (IGB) spent almost \u20ac18,000 on public relations consultants in the three months after an RT\u00c9 Investigates programme exposed shocking welfare abuses in the industry last year.\n\nThe IGB, which receives annual state funding of around \u20ac16 million, hired top communications firm Heneghan PR a week after the documentary claimed that 6,000 greyhounds were being killed every year.\n\nRecords released under the Freedom of Information Act reveal efforts to restrict media coverage of stadium closures, and to ignore press queries relating to welfare issues as the authority sought to manage the fallout from the controversy.\n\nHeneghan PR \u2013 predominantly the firm\u2019s MD Nigel Heneghan, and former government press secretary Eoghan \u00d3 Neachtain \u2013 also advised the IGB in relation to its appearance before the Oireachtas agriculture committee, and its unsuccessful complaint against RT\u00c9 over the documentary last year.\n\nThe company also assisted with a separate complaint to RT\u00c9\u2019s Liveline last August, in which the IGB expressed \u201cdisappointment\u201d in an initial draft at not being invited to contribute to a discussion on the radio show about the treatment of greyhounds.\n\nHowever, Nigel Heneghan removed the reference to \u201cdisappointment\u201d in an email to the IGB\u2019s press officer \u201cbecause they could say if you are that disappointed, why don\u2019t you come on air tomorrow \u2013 which is what we want to avoid\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cThey could still ask us, but the updated wording might make it easier to say no!\u201d\n\nA number of greyhound stadiums closed in the months following the RT\u00c9 documentary. Emails between the IGB and Heneghan PR reveal a strategy of \u201climiting stories to local coverage if we only release locally for now\u201d.\n\n\u201cI agree with [the IGB press officer] in terms of endeavouring to keep it local in the short term,\u201d wrote Nigel Heneghan.\n\nIn the case of Longford Greyhound Stadium, it was decided not to inform local media of its closure at all. The stadium had not issued a statement locally due to a poor relationship with the media, according to the IGB press officer.\n\n\u201cOn that note, it might be a case of alerting Longford media to the story if we send our statement out of the blue,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cMy suggestion again is to put it up on our own website for now and deal with queries from there.\u201d\n\nIGB CEO Ger Dollard intervened in a discussion about how to deal with repeated queries from a Mail on Sunday journalist concerning the welfare of a greyhound owned by a syndicate of current and former Oireachtas members.\n\n\u201cI would ignore the emails,\u201d he wrote. \u201cNigel can tell her if he wishes that he has sent on to the IGB and is awaiting a response?\u201d\n\n#Open journalism No news is bad news Support The Journal Your contributions will help us continue to deliver the stories that are important to you Support us now\n\nThe strategy appears to have worked, as Nigel Heneghan wrote on August 11: \u201cNothing in Mail on Sunday \u2013 good.\u201d\n\nA total of \u20ac17,785.80 was paid to the PR firm by the IGB in the first three months after the RT\u00c9 documentary was aired.\n\nA spokesman for the organisation said that it maintains consistent engagement with all media, and has endeavoured to respond to a large number of media queries at all times.\n\n\u201cThe situations regarding the closures of Lifford and Longford greyhound stadia were, at the time suggested, fluid and changeable\u2026 A decision was made to prioritise informing local media in these areas of impending closures before national media to ensure the greyhound community in these areas\u2026 were fully and adequately informed,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the journalist who inquired about the Oireachtas syndicate was \u201cextensively engaged with\u201d but the \u201congoing submission of queries on a welfare case was seen as unreasonable, and the IGB chose not to further respond\u201d."
