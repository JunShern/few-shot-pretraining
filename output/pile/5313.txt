    "text": "We have already told you about one of the dirtiest cities in the world. It\u2019s called Karabash and is located in the Chelyabinsk region.\n\nThe place embraces a copper plant where metal has been smelt for over a century. Nobody thought about ecology that time. In the result, Karabash became one of the dirtiest places on the planet. Installation of new equipment decreased harmful emissions twice.\n\nThat is what the place looks like when viewed from the plane.\n\nThe Argazinskoye water-storage basin is located 10 km away from the city.\n\nThis is a former cinema, its back part is completely destructed.\n\nSome time ago this used to be a residential area but the place was abandoned because of severe emissions produced by the plant.\n\nThough this very house in the picture is abandoned, many similar houses are still inhabited by people who live 100 meters away from the plant.\n\nWhen emissions are especially abundant, people lose their consciousness, have headache and nausea.\n\nThe river is yellow because it is rich with iron. Its concentration exceeds normal values almost 50o times.\n\nLife in Karabash is worse than life in Chernobyl as citizens of the latter get compensation from the state.\n\nInhabitants of Karabash want their pension age to be decreased as nobody here lives too long. They say they have nowhere to go and have to stay here.\n\nLook at the earth surface and you will notice traces of chemical erosion.\n\nLocal inhabitants know what it means to have acidic rains. When it\u2019s raining it\u2019s hard to breathe. Men here die at the age of 45 and earlier.\n\nFor over than 100 years of work the plant burnt and destroyed a vast nearby territory. It vents over 180 tones of gas in the atmosphere annually. The gas which is transformed into acidic rains irrigates adjacent territories.\n\nMain part of the city looks like a village. Local people suffer from tumors, eczema, cerebral paralysis, birth defects, etc.\n\nIn 2004 temperature regimen in one of the furnaces was changed and led to a huge emission into the atmosphere. Before that there was a rain that destroyed every plant around. The forest was all yellow.\n\nMany people die after two months of working at the plant. All kids are coughing because of bad ecology.\n\nLocation: Karabash\n\nvia raskalov-vit"
