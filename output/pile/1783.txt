But without net neutrality, telecoms could start charging businesses at their own discretion and promote some content over others.\n\nPhoto: Thatree Charoenpornpimongul, HO / TNS\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever had to self-censor a curse word or two when looking at your latest internet or cable bill, you\u2019re not alone. Telecoms are among the most loathed institutions in the United States. Two of the America\u2019s top 20 most-hated companies are telecoms \u2014 Comcast and CenturyLink \u2014 according to a recent report by 24/7 Wall St.\n\nWant to leave one of these bottom-of-the-barrel providers? Good luck. The bulk of Americans don\u2019t have much choice. Around 40 percent of the country has only one option for broadband internet access.\n\nThat means telecoms have got customers over a barrel. Just this month, Comcast announced that it would refuse to offer its fastest internet connection speeds to subscribers who won\u2019t also sign up for cable television, essentially forcing Americans to sign up for a service they might not want.\n\nWith no competition, there\u2019s nothing to stop telecoms from using their monopoly power to exploit people through higher prices and lower speeds \u2014 nothing except for federal regulation.\n\nThat\u2019s why it is imperative that Congress use the Congressional Review Act \u2014 the CRA \u2014 to save net neutrality.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) has said he plans to file a discharge petition today, which could force a vote on the matter. All 49 Senate Democrats along with Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine have said they support restoring net neutrality after the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s regulatory flip-flop last year. It\u2019ll only take one more Republican to gain a majority.\n\nAs we\u2019ve written before, the internet relies on net neutrality to function, and Congress has a duty to put it back in place. The underlying beauty of the internet is that it serves as the ultimate free market. Everyone competes on a level playing field. But without net neutrality, telecoms could start charging businesses at their own discretion and promote some content over others.\n\nComcast could prioritize MSNBC.com, which it owns, over Fox News. Verizon could slow down YouTube and Netflix while keeping fast speeds for its own streaming services. That actually happened.\n\nIf telecoms can give preferential treatment to their own products \u2014 or the highest bidder \u2014 then it becomes difficult for customers to discern quality services from the corporate favorites. Established companies could squash startups before they had an opportunity to compete.\n\nIt also gives a few telecom conglomerates a massive amount of power over your daily life.\n\nThat sort of preferentialism is illegal for pipeline companies and the electric grid. In the energy industry, content providers must remain separate from distribution networks. There\u2019s a glass wall between drillers and transportation networks.\n\nIn fact, all sorts of networks, from telephones to shipping companies, have to abide by these kinds of rules. It is how the world of commerce functions. Lawyers call it \u201ccommon carrier.\u201d\n\nNet neutrality was supposed to establish similar rules for the internet.\n\nHowever, the FCC under President Trump voted to roll back those rules and grant telecoms special treatment, permitting them to implement all sorts of bizarre charging schemes.\n\nWhy? Because telecoms wanted more money.\n\nWithout net neutrality to restrain them, companies like Comcast, AT&T and CenturyLink could essentially turn the digital freeway into a toll road.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not as if they\u2019re using that money to improve their connection speeds or invest in research and development. If you were wondering what your internet bill pays for, here\u2019s the answer: Comcast is preparing to offer $60 billion in cash to buy Twenty-First Century Fox Inc. If the deal goes through, the telecom will not only a own film catalog that stretches from Star Wars and X-Men to Kung-Fu Panda \u2014 it\u2019ll also own near-monopolistic control over its distribution. And you can bet it\u2019ll use that to squeeze you for every last cent.\n\nIt is all part of a pattern in which telecoms buy up content providers, consolidate their corporate holdings, then exploit the lack of competition to charge more for services.\n\nCongress has the ability to tie the hands of these unwieldy corporations and force them to treat customers fairly. That means voting yes on a net neutrality CRA and ensuring that telecoms have to follow the same rules as every other network."
