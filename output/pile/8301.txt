    "text": "Photojournalism And a Special Guest\n\nCPS is pleased to announce that Bruce Bishop will be our special guest and will talk about Drone Photography. Please bring up to 6 of your digital or print Photojournalistic pictures to share - and join us on March 23rd at 7:30pm! These Photojournalism evenings are designed to celebrate the actual photograph: pictures that tell stories without the aid of accompanying words or Photoshop enhancements. This event is free and open to all.\n\n3/16 Creative Competition Results Posted!\n\nResults from the third and final Creative and Pictorial competition of the year have now been posted and can be viewed in the Competition Results section of this website. Bookmark this page in order to quickly track updated results as the competition year unfolds. A slideshow of the winning images from the 2/2 Black & White competition can also be viewed here. A reminder to members that a database of all competition entries in Excel spreadsheet format is updated shortly after each competition.\n\nTwo Popular Field Trips are Back!\n\nWe're pleased to announce that two of our most popular field trip destinations are back on the calendar! Registration is NOW OPEN for our annual visit to Mansfield Reformatory on Saturday, June 2nd. This trip is open to EVERYONE, with separate prices for Photographers and Non-Photographers. And we're in the final stages of wrapping up the details for front row box seats at the 2018 Air Show on Labor Day weekend, featuring the US Navy Blue Angels - details coming soon!\n\nThe Current Issue of the Darkroom Door is Here\n\nThe latest issue of the Award Winning! CPS Newsletter covering the first 6 months of 2017, The Darkroom Door, is now available for viewing and downloading in the Newsletter section of this website. Click here to view this and previous issues.\n\nNew Competition Tutorial Available!\n\nTo help you get the most out of your images, a new tutorial has been added to the Competitions page of this website! Sometimes using 'standard' mat sizes for print competitions is easier and less expensive but may not showcase your image to best advantage by choosing the right size and ratio for maximum impact. And while you're reading, check out the 'How to Compete' and 'How to Mat' presentations as well - all found on the Competitions page of this website. Good Luck to all competitors!\n\nExhibition Gallery Pages Have Been Updated!\n\nThe exhibition Gallery pages of this website have been updated and now include slideshows of all images displayed in off-site CPS Exhibitions from 2011 through this summer! Click the link to view the UPDATED Exhibition Gallery\n\nWelcome to CPS!\n\nThe Cleveland Photographic Society is not your typical 'camera club'.
