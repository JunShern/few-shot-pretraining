    "text": "PSYCHIC, INTUITIVE, MYSTICAL, PROPHETIC INDICATORS IN THE NATAL CHART\n\n\u00b7 Disclaimer: My research has proven, to me, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that there is an endless number of psychic, intuitive indicators in anyone\u2019s chart, and I could not find them all. Every time I tried, Spirit showed me another from a respected, (and published) astrological source, so I \u201cdrew a line in the sand, and concluded that it could not be done with analysis alone. These Lists are NOT complete, and cannot be relied upon alone to tell you that you are or are not\u2026psychic, using your intuition, etc. I believe we are all born intuitive; it is known as our 6th sense. It is a built-in truth filter, among other things. It lies in our solar plexus, but, because most of us operate soley out of our heads, we don\u2019t realize we are born intuitive. Your Crystal Children know they are born intuitive; theirs is well-developed. I believe that this is one of the things that makes them act, and react, so differently from us, also why we, as parents, feel so powerless and helpless in trying to understand them, why what our mothers taught us about raising children, and what they are suggesting now may not be working.\n\nOnly an astrologer can give you an accurate interpretation of your natal chart, and that requires assessing the whole chart, something I did not do here. I only extrapolated psychic aspects from other astrologers\u2019 published works (listed at the end of the lists), and this is not the same, nor as accurate as a professional astrological chart interpretation. This said, I think it is fun to look for psychic indicators in your own chart, so I\u2019m publishing/posting these for your enjoyment.\n\n*******\n\n\u00b7 Three or more indicators are required (but each child had at least three and many had many more). They set up the opportunity and/or predisposition for psychism (clairvoyance, clairaudience, mediumistic abilities, healing abilities, etc) intuition, prophetic, and/or mystical powers.\n\n\u00b7 Use your own \u201ctruth filter\u201d. You will know if an aspect applies to you, or not. This list will only confirm that which you already suspect, or think you have, and give you something concrete that says, \u201cWow! Yes! I am psychic! Or I never knew I was, but now I have more faith that it is really, truly so!\n\nIf you run into problems, please e-mail me at truthseeker2566@yahoo.com and I will try to help you out.\n\nENJOY! HAVE FUN WITH THIS!\n\nAspects:\n\n5. Moon Conjunct Neptune: Mystical, intuitive type; very psychic nature. \u201cWhen Neptune is harmoniously linked to the luminaries in the chart of a person who can respond to its higher rays, it can bestow gifts of a clairvoyant and clairaudient nature.\u201d Pg 558, Alan Oken\u2019s Complete Astrology. Mystical, but not very practical, unless there are other indicators in the chart.\n\n6. Moon Sextile Neptune: These individuals have the opportunity to use their sensitivity to vibrations in the world around them.

The intuition is highly developed and used to create a better understanding among all peoples.\n\n51. ** Unaspected Uranus (to another Planet):According to Bil Tierney, Dynamics of Aspect Analysis, \u201c..When unaspected, Higher Octave planets (Uranus / Neptune / Pluto) are going to either operate in an exclusively unconscious fashion, with occasional spurts of unpredictable and unusual behavior, or perhaps not at all, remaining totally latent on the character-level, and thus projected onto people and situations. Yet, for some individuals, for unknown reasons, an unaspected Higher Octave (Uranus, in this example) could indicate extraordinary capacity far beyond average human expression, almost as if these people are constantly plugged into unlimited sources of cosmic power. With ordinary people, when unaspected, Uranus becomes almost self-contained and independent of outside social influence. It tends to be less driven to inaugurate breakthroughs in the outer world environment in the more open, rebellious manner of a heavily aspected Uranus. Flashes of genius or sparks of intuition may be specifically felt in the house area, where the individual can feel quite unique and unmatched, for better or worse.\u201d (I believe this applies to Crystal Children and has been included for that reason.)\n\n52. Neptune Conjunct Pluto: Very great sensitivity to the inner worlds; uncanny ability to see through people and circumstances, if willing to sacrifice self to Higher Self can be led to heights of spiritual attainment. Advancement along spiritual lines can be greatly accelerated in company of other like-minded people.\n\n53. Neptune Sextile Pluto: There is the opportunity to use your psychic abilities for the benefit of humanity; Can develop clairvoyance & prophetic ability. Have precognitive dreams. Strong psychic healing powers; desire for justice for all people. Abhor violence or anything that might degrade or oppress another person or animal.\n\n54. ** Unaspected Neptune (to another planet): According to Bil Tierney, Dynamics of Aspect Analysis, \u201c..When unaspected, Higher Octave planets (Uranus / Neptune / Pluto) are going to either operate in an exclusively unconscious fashion, with occasional spurts of unpredictable and unusual behavior, or perhaps not at all, remaining totally latent on the character-level, and thus projected onto people and situations. Yet, for some individuals, for unknown reasons, an unaspected Higher Octave (Neptune, in this example) could indicate extraordinary capacity far beyond average human expression, almost as if these people are constantly plugged into unlimited sources of cosmic power. (For ordinary people, brackets, mine) Neptune tends towards withdrawal, seclusion and privacy. It prefers to remain absorbed in the inner worlds of consciousness and has a harder time adjusting itself to manifesting in concrete, solid terms. The more aspects it has, the more likely it is to be challenged to manifest itself through external experience, regardless of the level or quality shown.\u201d\n\n55. North Node Trine Uranus: These individuals will attract spiritual teachers, from \u201cthe Other Side\u201d , who they have been close to in other lifetimes and who have taught them to tap their unconscious minds.\n\n56. North Node Conjunct Neptune: The power of this conjunction will attract spiritual teachers perhaps from The Other Side who can teach them how to hear and see into the astral world.\n\n57. North Node Sextile Neptune: There is an opportunity for spiritual teachers to enter their lives who can teach them how to hear and see into the astral world.\n\n58. North Node Trine Neptune: These individuals will attract spiritual teachers who they have been close to in other lifetimes and who have taught them how to hear and see into the astral world.\n\n59. South Node Conjunct Neptune: The power of this conjunction will attract karmic situations which will enable them to hear and see into the astral world.\n\n60. South Node Sextile Neptune: There is an opportunity for karmic situations to occur which enables the person to hear and see into the astral world.\n\n61. South Node Trine Neptune: These individuals willingly attract karmic situations to occur which will enable them to see and hear into the astral world.\n\n62. South Node Oppose Neptune: An awareness should be developed that karmic situations must, and will, occur for the purpose of dissolving their fear of the unknown, by enabling them to hear and see into the astral world.\n\n63. Midheaven Conjunct Neptune: Can become a success in society by utilizing their psychic abilities.\n\n64. Ascendant Conjunct Neptune: Psychic and intuitive\n\n65. Ascendant Sextile Neptune: (Opportunity to become) Psychic and intuitive\n\n66. Ascendant Trine Neptune: Psychic and intuitive\n\n67. Grand Water Trine: Psychic energy, if used.\n\n68. Grand Trine including Uranus: Psychic and intuitive abilities strong\n\n69. Grand Trine Including Neptune: Psychic abilities strong\n\n70. ** Mystic Rectangle: Pulls the energies of the separate planets togetherso that they operate as one unit.\n\n71. ** Mystic Rectangle with Uranus or Neptune: Pulls the energies of the separate planets together so that they operate as one unit. Incorporates your intuitive abilities if Uranus is one of the planets, and your psychic, mediumistic abilities if it is Neptune.\n\n72. ** Kite Formation: the Focal Point of the Kite collects the energies of the other planets involved. All of this energy is then focused and channeled through this one focal planet\u2019s qualities. Because of its power, it can become a focal point of the personality. It is a grand trine, with a sextile aspect connecting to each side of one of its three points. This is called the focal point, or point of the Kite. This focal point is also part of an internal opposition that creates a \u201ctail\u201d for the kite formation. The opposition acts as an internal balancing rod, so that the energy/qualities of the planetary kite tail of the opposition are used to push the energies of the focal planet into action. The type of actions taken, how the kite affects the native, depends on the planets, houses, signs, etc involved in the formation. I use the Moon\u2019s Nodes, and the Asc/Desc, MC/IC axes to form the kite formation.\n\n73. ** Kite Formation with Uranus or Neptune as point of kite: Adds an intuitive (Uranus) or psychic (Neptune) energy to the kite\u2019s actions. If one of these is the focal planet, then it is most likely that the native would be expressing his/her intuitive / psychic abilities in the outer world, or at least be consciously using them for soul growth for him/herself.\n\n74.

Opposite the North Node, which looks like an upside-down capital U, with small circles at the ends) indicates psychic, mediumistic, astral or out-of-body abilities; abilities were developed in a past life and are available, * if not afflicted , especially to Uranus or Neptune.\n\n156. **South Node in 9th House: In South Node, indicates prophetic, mystic, or visionary abilities were developed in a past life and available in this life time, *if not afflicted, especially to Uranus or Neptune.\n\n157. **South Node in 12th House: Gives unconscious psychic ability. It is a carry-over from a past life, and often karmic. Other indicators should be in chart to develop psychic gifts in this life time, # excluding squares or oppositions to Neptune and Uranus.\n\nGlossary:\n\n8th House represents the entrance to the next dimension, rules the psychic senses and out-of-body experiences. Rules psychic levels. People with planets here have often brought over a legacy of sensitivity to invisible currents. If the planets in this house are afflicted, the individual has been involved in misuse of psychic faculties, particularly if Mars is afflicted to Neptune or in this house.\n\n9th House: Intuition, inspiration, spiritual visions. Indicates higher levels of consciousness as to both mind and emotion. (See above for deeper explanation of higher consciousness.) Planets in their fall or detriment show misuse of their energies; wise use is shown by rulers and exaltation.\n\n12th House: Most psychically permeable. Serve or suffer is the motto of the 12th house.\n\nAscendant/Descendant: A line of self-awareness and intuition.\n\nAstrological Symbol Aspect Chart: Found on the lower left side of the natal (birth) chart. You will not need to use this graph to find your psychic, intuitive indicators\n\nAquarius: In a cosmic sense, the sign is the sign of the \u2018incoming age\u2019. The keyword of Aquarius is \u201cI know\u201d. Aquarians are mental pioneers, the forward thinking individuals who live in the future and not in the past. They are rebels and individualists that have to go their own way, learning their own way; Independent; imaginative, creative and inventive, there is a genius about them if they are evolved. When they are evolved, and their emotions are tenderized, no sign is more magnanimous or as monumental. When they \u201cfeel\u201d love instead of \u201cthink\u201d it they are great souls. It has two rulers: Saturn (responsibility) and Uranus (freedom). Without the discipline of Saturn, there can be no real freedom. Evolved souls have learned this lesson.\n\nCancer: The insistent; the sign of the Cosmic Mother who nourishes all humanity at her breast.\n\nConjunction/Conjunct: (as in for example, Sun conjunct Uranus) Keyword is emphasis. It is known as power operating; it is a concentrated massing of energy. It represents planets within 10 degrees of each other. (Astrology: A Cosmic Science, pg. 70-71).\n\nGrand Trine: A pattern formed by three planets in a triangle of the same element. In this case, it is the Water element, which is known as the Psychic Trinity. These energies are in harmony with each other so that they bring the harmony and ease in the houses and matters that the planets represent.\n\nHigher consciousness describes the ability to intuit truths and spiritual knowledge associated with the teachings of the great Masters. Excerpt from the website www.themystic.org:\n\n\u201cBy higher consciousness we are implying a realm of awareness beyond regular consciousness. Higher consciousness is awareness at the source of our thinking, feeling, and acting. Higher consciousness is that dynamic awareness which enables ordinary consciousness. Higher consciousness enables you to think, enables your feeling nature to work. It enables you to act wisely and well. Higher consciousness is the essential intelligence, energy, and power that enables breathing and brain function, that enables sensations to enter us through our sense organs.\u201d\n\nIt is associated with Jupiter, Sagittarius, and the 9th house.\n\nIntuition is inner knowing and is associated with the planet Uranus.\n\nJupiter: Basic Keywords: Aspiration, Benevolence, Religion, Confidence, Optimism, Humane, Mercy, Dignity, Idealism, Faithfulness, Generosity\n\nMars: Keywords: Energy, initiative, courage, transmutation, Fearlessness, Expression\n\nMercury: Keywords: Mind; link between spirit and matter; Expressiveness, Discrimination, Awareness, Brilliance, Adaptability; Senses\n\nMoon: Personality, Sensitivity, Receptivity, Feeling, Imagination, positive psychism Mystical, visionary or prophetic abilities describe the ability to intuitively attain and comprehend spiritual knowledge or truths, that are currently beyond the understanding of the common man, or the masses; the ability to achieve communion with God through contemplation and love without the medium of human reason, or another mediator, such as a priest or minister.\n\nNeptune: The positive aspects of Neptune show wisdom beyond reason, genius, creative ability in the literary, poetic and musical fields, intuition, clairvoyance, contact with the higher invisible realms, and the realization of the Unity of all life. Not everybody can respond fully to the higher vibrations of Neptune. Neptune represents spiritual wisdom; is the mystic, has mediumistic ability and psychic powers. Neptune represents social responsibility; reveals pattern of social obligation showing how person will conform to group consciousness. Shows cosmic debts you must pay. When afflicted, Neptune cloaks the issue with vagueness, obscurity, illusion, confusion, misunderstanding, intrigue and fraudulent appearances. Those born with Neptune in a square or opposition aspect, see note below.\n\nNorth Node looks like an inverted or upside-down Capital U with circles at the ends. South Node looks like a capital U, with the small circles at the ends.\n\nOpposition: Keyword is awareness. Oppositions are opposing forces that must be reconciled. They call for co-operation. Opposing forces come from outside as well as inside, and often involve other people. It calls for compromise. They can cause you to be pulled apart by two contrary pulls, but like two poles of a battery, one may also be illumined by the spark flowing from pole to pole. Awareness causes consciousness to expand and develop. Solution: Learn to agree with your adversary while you are in the way with him. (Astrology: A Cosmic Science., pg. 71)\n\nPisces: The compassionate; represents the wise use of the emotional nature and compassionate understanding.\n\nPsychic Abilities indicates the ability to contact those living on \u201cThe Other Side\u201d, in the World of Spirit, or the Heaven World. As defined in Collins Compact English Dictionary: Sensitive to phenomena lying outside range of normal experience. 2. Of soul or mind. 3. That appears to be outside the region of physical law.\n\nIt includes such gifts as:\n\nClairvoyance, (clear sight)\n\nClairaudience (clear hearing)\n\nClairsentience (Clear touch), also known as Psychometry: reading objects by touch.\n\nPsychometry generally refers to the ability to gain impressions and information about an object or anything connected to it by holding it in your hand. A person with this ability is called a psychometrist or a scryer. Excerpt from: www.crystalinks.com\n\nClairessence (literally, clear smell and taste); also known as clairolfacrience\n\nMediumistic abilities\n\nChanneling abilities\n\nAstral or out-of-body experiences\n\nRelates to the 8th house and Scorpio\n\nSaturn: The tester. Saturn\u2019s goal is perfection. Through the chastening process of testing, sorrow, delay, disappointment, limitation , privation, man learns the purpose of life is to gain experience, patience, humility, wisdom and compassion. Keywords: Patience, self-discipline, humility, responsibility, diplomacy, respect, endurance.\n\nScorpio: The passionate; represents the control and mastery of the emotional nature through loving Will.\n\nSextile: Sextiles are underlined to indicate potential or opportunity. They must be activated or they will not operate. (Astrology: A cosmic Science, pg. 71) This is an aspect that denotes potential or opportunity for development in this lifetime, and differs from the trine which indicates that the ability has already been developed in past life times and is available for use in this one.\n\nSouth Node/North Node: These are associated with the Moon. The North Node is the path of spiritual growth, and represents \u201cnew territory, spiritually\u201d. As such it is known as the path to spiritual growth. The South Node represents \u201cwhere we\u2019ve been, what we\u2019ve learned and brought with us into this incarnation, for better or worse. They are always exactly opposite each other, like the North and South Poles of the earth.\n\nSquare: Keyword is obstacle. Squares represent the lessons we have failed to learn. The quickest way to release ourselves from these difficulties is to face them and solve them. (Astrology: A Cosmic Science, pg. 72).\n\nSun: Keywords: Will, individuality, spirit; faith, confidence, vitality, poise, positivity\n\nTrine: Trines are the harmonies we have earned; the blessings that come when we love and love wisely. Trines throw a protective influence. Benefits that come without effort and without any activity on the part of the individual concerned. They are the results of constructive service and harmonious actions in other lifetimes. (Astrology: A Cosmic Science, pg. 71.)\n\nUranus: Uranus represents intuition that comes like lightening, in a flash. Uranus is the occultist.\n\nVenus: Love, harmony, refinement, sociability, gentleness, cooperativeness, affection, Constructiveness\n\nNotes and Other Odds & Ends:\n\n* If the natal chart indicates how psychic abilities were used in past lives, or how they will be used in this one, I can not see it, so all psychic gifts, to my knowledge, like everything else in our lives, can be used either for good or evil. The choice is always left up to us. However, no matter its use now or in past lives, there is ALWAYS a good reason..ALWAYS! or as Isabel Hickey says, \u201cIt is ALL right.\u201d\n\n* New Age egos will have Uranus, not Aquarius, prominently located (in 1st, 4th, 7th, or10th house, or have it configured with the Sun, Moon or Mercury.) Indicates the person has passed the test of Saturn.\n\n* *If afflicted, investigating into psychic or occult could bring trouble: your intuition will tell you if this applies. It will be an obvious and strong feeling; you cannot make a \u2018mistake\u2019 and \u2018accidentally\u2019 get into trouble in the metaphysical/occult/esoteric/spiritual realm, because we are always warned in advance, and then we choose to proceed \u2018where angels fear to tread\u2019.\n\n* ** No research to back up this claim. This was added because of a strong intuitive feeling that I should, and I always trust these feelings, and act on them. (It\u2019s the only way to develop your own intuitive, psychic skills.)\n\n\u00b7 *** Compiled specifically to determine if it were possible to see psychic abilities in children born since 1999, who are being identified, according to my understanding, as crystal children because of the color of their auras and their level of spiritual evolution. Those I have met, and whose charts I have done, appear to be spiritually highly evolved, advanced souls. This research project was designed to test this hypothesis.\n\n\u00b7 # Neptune In square or opposition, can give psychic and intuitive powers but can become the dark occultist if he/she uses power for self. Have attained spirituality in other lifetimes but have lost their equilibrium through not balancing their emotional or devotional fanaticism with mental poise and logic.\n\nSources:\n\nGreen, Jeff, PLUTO: The Evolutionary Journey of the Soul, Llewellyn Publications, 1996\n\n, URANUS: Freedom from the Unknown, Llewellyn Publications, 1988.\n\nHand, Robert, HOROSCOPE SYMBOLS, Schiffer Publishing, 1981\n\nHickey, Isabel, ASTROLOGY, A COSMIC SCIENCE: The Classic Work on Spiritual Astrology, CRCS Publications, 1992\n\nLoftus, Myrna, A SPIRITUAL APPROACH TO ASTROLOGY: A Complete Textbook of Astrology, CRCS Publications, 1983\n\nOken, Alan, ALAN OKEN\u2019S COMPLETE ASTROLOGY, Bantam Books, 1988\n\nSakoian, Frances & Acker, Louis, THE ASTROLOGER\u2019S HANDBOOK, Harper & Row, 1973\n\nSpiller, Jan, ASTROLOGY FOR THE SOUL, Bantam, 1997\n\nTierney, Bil, DYNAMICS OF ASPECT ANALYSIS: New Perceptions in Astrology, CRCS Publications, 1983\n\nTompkins, Sue, ASPECTS IN ASTROLOGY: A Comprehensive Guide to Interpretation, Element Books, Inc., 1995"
