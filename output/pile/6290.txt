Co-founded in 2009 by Melissa Hartwig and Dallas Hartwig. Whole30\u00ae has proven to be an insightful and eye-opening experience. The program has delivered incredible and life-changing results for millions of people.\n\nWhat results are we talking about? People who participate in Whole30\u00ae tend to report increased energy, significant fat loss, improved athletic performance, improved skin quality, better sleep, and enhanced food taste. Perhaps most importantly a healthier relationship with food and a deeper understanding of how different foods affect them individually.\n\nHow Whole30\u00ae Works\n\nThe basic premise of Whole30\u00ae is as follows:\n\nFor 30 days, you completely eliminate a number of food groups that are known to be problematic for health. Including sugar, grains, alcohol, dairy, legumes, and additives like MSG, carrageenan, and sulfites. Even baked goods made with Whole30\u00ae \u201capproved\u201d ingredients are not permitted. Stated on their website, \u201ca pancake is still a pancake, even if it\u2019s made with coconut flour.\u201d\n\nWhat you DO eat is real food: veggies, meat, fish, eggs, produce, herbs, spices, and quality fats. The goal is to fuel yourself with whole, nutrient-dense, unprocessed foods for 30 days straight. NO \u201ccheating!\u201d This gives your body a chance to detox and feel what it\u2019s like to function on food you evolved to eat.\n\nAt the end of the 30 day program, you gradually and strategically re-introduce the eliminated food groups so you can learn which types of food affect you and how. This helps you move forward from the program so you can maintain a sustainable way of eating that\u2019s a \u201cbest fit\u201d for you. \u201cFood freedom,\u201d as Melissa Hartwig calls it.\n\nIt\u2019s fairly \u201cstrict\u201d as far as nutrition plans go. Salad dressings and deli meats are no-go if they contain any non-compliant ingredients or additives. For most participants, the so-called \u201cradical\u201d experiment is overwhelmingly worth it.\n\n5 Reasons Why September is the Perfect Time to do a Whole30\u00ae Challenge\n\nWhole30\u00ae challenges can be done any time of the year. The company has a few annual Whole30\u00ae challenges for people interested in doing one with the support of an online community. The September Whole30\u00ae is one of their more popular challenges.\n\nA few reasons why:\n\nSeptember is the unofficial \u201cfresh start\u201d of the year\u2014a perfect time to \u201creset\u201d out of vacation mode.\n\nWhole30\u00ae inspires creativity. In the kitchen and while out to eat with loved ones. Streamline your mealtime!\n\nA Whole30\u00ae in September allows you to regain a sense of control in a season that is often stressful and jam-packed.\n\nA September Whole30\u00ae prepares you (physically and mentally) for the busy holiday season. It gives you a solid baseline of healthy habits to fall back on.\n\nThis challenge is a fun way to do something with friends, family, and entire online community of like-minded people!\n\nWe love serving health-conscious guests with quality, affordable, and delicious food! We\u2019re also the 4th restaurant in the United States and the only restaurant in Indy to earn the official \u201cWhole30 Approved\u00ae\u201d seal.
