Good link building is the cornerstone of solid off-page SEO which can yield those coveted rankings and free organic traffic.\n\nBuilding backlinks takes time and requires patience. Making sure you maximize your efforts is vital to ensure your rewarded handsomely for your efforts.\n\nWhat is the Best Link Building Method Anyway?\n\nThere are many different ways to build backlinks. Article directories, forum postings, press release submissions, article marketing and social bookmarking are just a few of the common methods used by internet marketers.\n\nMy favorite way to build high quality backlinks is by producing unique content and submitting it to various sources that are willing to accept it in return for contextual or semi-contextual backlinks.\n\nThis is by far the best link building strategy. Writing content and submitting it to relevant and good sources. You can write the content yourself or outsource it.\n\nIf you need more link building power, you have to guest post\u2026\n\nFinding blogs that relate to your content is step number one. You can search for blogs that accept guest posts in your niche by doing some smart Googling. Some blogs make their guest posting policies very clear and others don\u2019t. Taking a few minutes to contact blog owners is worth the effort if your email is straightforward and to the point. Forget about sending a generic spammy message \u2013 blog owners get those every day from pro link builders and SEO firms asking for guest posts. Get personal and let them know about how good your articles are and how they can truly provide value to their readers.\n\nKeep it real and forthcoming and you will slowly build a list of solid blogs that are more than happy to accept your blog posts or buy seo services . Submitting articles with in-content or author bio links will greatly help your SEO efforts. Mostly because, these blogs aren\u2019t part of link building networks or in the business of providing links to everyone via guest posting. They offer value that just can\u2019t compare to low-quality link blogs.\n\nGood link building is about producing a wide variety of backlinks on all kind of different sources. Not just places that everyone else submits to. Finding those guest posting gems can dramatically impact your SEO efforts in ways other link building strategies simply can\u2019t.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing quite like natural backlinks surrounded by unique relevant content on a high quality page that has some authority in your industry. That right there is the best way to build backlinks for SEO.\n\nAs you can see from the examples above, using quality web content to produce backlinks will give you the most mileage when it comes to SEO and your keyword rankings.\n\nWhy is the quality of content so important? Well \u2013 if your content isn\u2019t valuable in some way \u2013 most reputable blog owners and even premium guest posting sources won\u2019t accept them. Getting links on those really awesome sites will require good content. This might require more work but the resulting backlinks are worth every ounce."
