    "text": "Hammer Nutrition Perpetuem | 16 Servings\n\nHammer Nutrition Perpetuem - Welcome to the world\u2019s finest fuel specifically formulated for multi-hour to multi-day events. No matter how long or extreme your exercise regimen or Ironman races may be, Hammer Nutrition Perpetuem is always up to the task. Thoroughly tested and proven in the world\u2019s toughest endurance events, Hammer Nutrition Perpetuem\u2019s unique formula \u2013 containing complex carbohydrates, soy protein, healthy fats, and key auxiliary nutrients such as sodium phosphate \u2013 is unsurpassed for maintaining optimal athletic performance for as long as you want. Perpetuem provides consistent, reliable energy, maximizes stored fat utilization, and buffers lactic acid to prevent muscle fatigue. On the road or trail, Hammer Nutrition Perpetuem is the breakfast, lunch, and dinner of champions. Take it long with Hammer Nutrition Perpetuem!\n\nExtra Benefits:\n\nCarnosine, one of the ingredients in Hammer Nutrition Perpetuem (it\u2019s also in HEED, Sustained Energy, and Recoverite), is both a performance aid (a superb acid buffer) and a premium general health nutrient (multiple free-radical scavenging and anti-glycation antioxidant).\n\nGluten-free\n\nConsistent, stable energy\n\nEasy to digest\n\nMinimize lean muscle tissue cannibalization\nNever before has a fuel so complete and effective been available to endurance athletes prior to now.\n\nThe container of fuel you possess is a result of several years of research and thousands of miles of testing in a variety of endurance disciplines; it is the first fuel introduced by Hammer Nutrition in over a decade. PERPETUEM represents the ultimate, never-before-available link to satisfying the body's fueling requirements no matter how long or difficult your exercise session or race is.\n\nCarbohydrates - As with all Hammer Nutrition fuels, we never add simple sugars to the carbohydrate profile. Hammer Nutrition Perpetuem contains a specific maltodextrin, which provides nearly 87% of its caloric composition in long chain carbohydrates.\n\nProtein - A new calcium-enhanced soy protein isolate known as \"XT\" makes up nearly 10% of the caloric profile of Hammer Nutrition Perpetuem, the same percentage as is cannibalized during long slow endurance workouts. This particular soy protein contains a very high amount of intact, cardiovascular-enhancing isoflavones.\n\nFat - A de-oiled \"super lecithin\" (extracted from the soybean) is ideal for consistently and reliably fueling the body and maximizing energy production from stored fatty acids.\n\nSweetener - We use Energy Smart, the same healthy sweetener in Hammer Gel, in Hammer Nutrition Perpetuem. This gives Hammer Nutrition Perpetuem a mellow-orange \"Dreamsicle\" flavor.\n\nApplication:\n\nUse as a primary source of calories during exercise/competition lasting more than two hours.\n\nMixing / Usage Instructions:\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Due to potential spoilage issues, Hammer Nutrition Perpetuem cannot be premixed and left for several hours in warm weather.\nYou can mix and consume Hammer Nutrition Perpetuem three different ways depending on individual preference and logistical concerns. Please experiment with the following options to determine which works best for you.\n\nThe One-Hour Bottle - Mix the suggested amount of Hammer Nutrition Perpetuem for your bodyweight (see chart below) in a 21-24 ounce (approx 520-710 ml) water bottle. Consume one bottle hourly. This method is ideal when training or racing with a support crew and vehicle. If you\u2019re without a support crew but still want to use this option for mixing, keep in mind that it\u2019s obviously less convenient as you\u2019ll have to stop more frequently to mix your fuel drink. Also, because you are trying to fulfill both hydration and caloric requirements from one source, you have limited ability to adjust one without affecting the other; you may need to consume additional water to satisfy hydration requirements.\n\nThe Multi-Hour Bottle - This is by far the most convenient method of fueling because it allows you to be self-sufficient for many hours, requiring only additional plain water along the way. The only limitation is how many scoops you can fit into a bottle. Determine your proper hourly intake of scoops by experimenting with the numbers from the dosage chart. Let\u2019s say you\u2019ve determined through testing that 2 scoops of Hammer Nutrition Perpetuem per hour is your ideal caloric intake. For a 4-hour workout, you\u2019ll need 8 scoops in a bottle, then filled with water and shaken well. You may need to add a few scoops at a time to get it all to mix well. You then \u201cnurse\u201d this bottle, taking small sips every 15-20 minutes. At this concentration, the water in the mixed bottle does not contribute much at all to your hourly fluid intake needs. To meet your fluid requirements, you carry a second and possibly even a third bottle of plain water, or use a hydration system, or know where you can refill along your route. Drink according to the temperature/humidity and your exertion level so that you consume in the range of 16-28 ounces (approx 475-830 ml) of plain water per hour.* This way, as long as you can obtain water along the way, you\u2019re set for hours of hard training.\n\nGel or Paste - If you want to carry the highest volume of calories in the least amount of space, making a thick mix is your best option. Hammer Nutrition Perpetuem can be made into a super-concentrated, near paste-like consistency and dispensed from a Hammer Gel flask. Using a blender or bowl and spoon, mix scoops of powder with a small amount of water, gradually adding water as necessary to create the consistency desired. If you're using the orange-vanilla flavor of Hammer Nutrition Perpetuem, remember that the heavier and more concentrated you mix it, the sweeter and stronger the flavor will become. You can also add Hammer Nutrition Hammer Gel or Hammer Nutrition HEED for flavor, if desired. Depending on how many scoops per hour you require, and how concentrated the mix is, each flask of Hammer Nutrition Perpetuem can supply you with 2-4 hours of fuel. As with the multi-hour bottle, you must carry additional bottles of plain water or use a hydration system to meet your fluid requirements.\n\nSuggested Doses by Body Weight*\n\nUp to 120 lbs (approx 54.5 kg) - up to 1 scoop/hour\n\n120-155 lbs (approx 54.5-70 kg) - up to 1.5 scoops/hour\n\n155-190 lbs (approx 70-86 kg) - up to 2 scoops/hour\n\n190+ lbs (86+ kg) - up to 2.5 scoops/hour\n\n*These are estimated doses. Each athlete should determine in training, under a variety of conditions, their personal optimum.\n\nImportant information:\n\nBy design, neither Hammer Nutrition Perpetuem nor Hammer Nutrition Sustained Energy contain any artificial preservatives. Preservatives provide absolutely no benefits for athletic performance or general health\u2014we consider them health hazards, in fact\u2014which is why we do not include them in either of these products, or any of the Hammer Nutrition fuels.\nAs a result of this, however, once mixed in solution the protein component in both Hammer Nutrition Perpetuem and Hammer Nutrition Sustained Energy is affected in the following ways:\n\nAt some point in time it will eventually sour and no longer be acceptable for consumption.\n\nIt tends to separate after awhile and may settle on the bottom of a bottle or hydration pack bladder.\nWe believe that not having artificial preservatives in the products is far more important that these two inconveniences; however, they are things that you need to remember when using Hammer Nutrition Perpetuem or Hammer Nutrition Sustained Energy.\n\nComparing Hammer Nutrition Sustained Energy and Perpetuem\n\nHammer Nutrition Sustained Energy is neutrally (a.k.a. \u201cplain\u201d) flavored. Perpetuem is available in two options: an orange-vanilla \"Dreamsicle\" flavor and in an unflavored/plain version.\n\nBottom line: With Sustained Energy and Perpetuem, you have two great long distance fuel choices. When exercise goes beyond about two hours, you can use either product as your primary or sole fuel, in any combination with each other or any other Hammer Nutrition fuel.\n\nShipping Weight: 3.5 lbs.\n\nreviews\n\nHammer Nutrition Perpetuem | 16 Servings\n\n$29.99\n\n5 Stars based on 1 Review(s)\n\nGuillermo\n\nMexicali, BC, Mexico\n\n5 Stars\n\nI would recommend this item to a friend.\n\nI would buy this product again and again\n\nJanuary 25, 2011\n\nis a good product, just say food problems have to prepare\ndifferently than suggested by the product, but gives very good\nresults over longer distances, I use it for an Ironman and only on\nthe bike"
