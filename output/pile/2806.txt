    "text": "Tax dollars should not go to buy out flooded homes\n\nWilliam Perlman/ The Star-LedgerFloodwaters rush past the Island Park Bridge in Paterson last year\n\nYou have to feel bad for the many New Jersey homeowners whose houses have been damaged or destroyed by flooding in recent years. Yes, we should feel compassion for these folks. But we should not give them any state or federal tax dollars.\n\nAs reported by The Star-Ledger on Thursday, thousands of homeowners, mostly in northern and central New Jersey, are applying for the government to purchase their homes, which have been damaged or destroyed by repeated flooding.\n\nThe appeals represent a record number of people applying for such state and federal help. The upsurge in applications comes on top of the nearly 400 homeowners who received such government help since 1998.\n\nWe feel bad for homeowners struggling with flooding, and compassion is a good thing. But it is wrong \u2013 morally and fiscally \u2013 to use precious taxpayer dollars to bail out individual homeowners who purchased homes in areas ordinarily subject to flooding.\n\nIn the first place, unlike federal aid for once-in-a-lifetime disasters, such a bailout is not in response to an unexpected emergency.\n\n\u201cI just can't deal with this anymore,\u201d a Little Falls resident told the Star-Ledger reporter. The woman\u2019s house, located along the Passaic River, \u201chas been hit repeatedly by major flooding since she moved in 15 years ago,\u201d according to the newspaper report. \u201cI love my house,\u201d the woman added, \u201cbut I have to get on with my life.\u201d\n\nI suspect that the reporter included this quote, the first in his front-page story, to give a sense of the woman's dire predicament. But as the woman stated, her home has been hit repeatedly by major flooding for the last decade and a half. The flooding is not an unexpected event, calling for emergency help. No, the flooding is a constant and very predictable event, something she likely knew when she purchased her house.\n\nNext, it is bad policy for the government to spend big bucks to help just a few people.\n\nI did the math. As the article states, the government has spent \u201ctens of millions of dollars\u201d to buy out and bulldoze some 400 homes in the last 14 years. Assuming tens of millions of dollars means between $10 million and $100 million, the government is giving between $25,000 and $250,000 to each homeowner.\n\nThat is different than the federal government spending money for a highway or a national park in a particular state. Those projects also cost big dollars, but the money benefits many people. Tens of thousands of dollars is not spent on each of just a few individuals.\n\nWhat would happen, for example, if homeowners in Denver, Colorado, asked the federal government to rescue homeowners harmed by snowstorms? The need would certainly be there, as snow causes tree limbs to fall onto roofs.\n\nBut how would it make sense for the federal government to pay money to help those residents? Snowstorms are a fact of life in the Rocky Mountains. It would not be right to use federal tax dollars to bail out those residents.\n\nThe unspoken assumption among the New Jersey homeowners is that everybody does it. Everybody feeds at the federal trough. If we don\u2019t get ours, then we will be putting money into the federal kitty without getting something in return. And after all, New Jersey on average pays more in taxes than it receives in return. (True enough, but mostly because salaries, and thus tax rates, are higher here.)\n\nThe typical price of the homes in flood-prone areas was not mentioned, but I suspect that many of the homeowners paid somewhat less for their homes because of where they were located. They got a cheaper house because of the expected danger of flooding. Ordinarily, caveat emptor. But these homeowners took advantage of a better deal \u2013 and now they want the government to bail them out.\n\nPerhaps not surprisingly, the Star-Ledger story was written so as to tug on the emotions. One homeowner wanting government help, for example, was quoted as saying her situation was \u201cheartbreaking.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the story conveyed a sense that government money is a free pot of gold. Homeowners in trouble need only tell a sad story for readers to exclaim \u2013 \u201cHow can the government be so heartless as to deny these poor folks some relief? Give them some money!\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, there was no mention that taxpayer money isn\u2019t really free. There was no acknowledgement that taxpayer money comes from other taxpayers coughing up their hard-earned cash.\n\nNot surprisingly, Sen. Frank Lautenberg, who has never met a piece of domestic federal spending he didn\u2019t like, was mentioned favorably in the story. The New Jersey Democrat announced that he was seeking another $21 million in federal assistance to help beleaguered homeowners.\n\nThe problem with this approach to the use of federal tax dollars goes beyond just giving money to homeowners beset by flooding. This same kind of story \u2013 how the government can provide \u201cfree\u201d services to bail out any and every need \u2013 is told by compassionate reporters over and over.\n\nIn that telling, federal money is free. (Or it would be, if only \u201cthe rich\u201d would pay their \u201cfair share.\u201d) All we need to do to loosen the state and federal purse strings is to tell of a human need in a gripping way.\n\nWith the federal government in hock up to its eyeballs (and beyond), this attitude of grab for all the cash you can does not bode well for the nation\u2019s fiscal future. Without a change of attitude, there can be little hope for a return to fiscal sanity."
