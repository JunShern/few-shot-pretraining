Marwan said that he was told that\n  Salman the Persian told the apostle that his master in \u2018Ammuriya told\n  him to go to a certain place in Syria where there was a man who lived\n  between two thickets. Every year as he used to go from one to the\n  other, the sick used to stand in his way and everyone he prayed for\n  was healed. He said, \u2018Ask him about this religion which you seek, for\n  he can tell you of it.\u2019 So I went on until I came to the place I had\n  been told of, and I found that people had gathered there with their\n  sick until he came out to them that night passing from one thicket to\n  the other. The people came to him with their sick and everyone he\n  prayed for was healed. They prevented me from getting to him so that I\n  could not approach him until he entered the thicket he was making for,\n  but I took hold of his shoulder. He asked me who I was as he turned to\n  me and I said, \u2018God have mercy on you, tell me about the Hanifiya, the\n  religion of Abraham.\u2019 He replied, \u2018You are asking about something men\n  do not inquire of today; the time has come near when a prophet will be\n  sent with this religion from the people of the haram. Go to him, for\n  he will bring you to it.\u2019 Then he went into the thicket. The apostle\n  said to Salman, \u2018If you have told me the truth, YOU MET JESUS THE SON\n  OF MARY.\u2019 \n(Guillaume, The Life of Muhammad, p. 98)\n\nWhat is the authenticity of this report? Did Salman the Persian really meet Prophet Isa AS?\n\nA:\n\nThere is an unknown (potentially weak) narrator between Asim  and Umar and a break in the chain between Umar and Salman so its authenticity is questionable.\nIbn Kathir in \u0627\u0644\u0628\u062f\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0646\u0647\u0627\u064a\u0629 comments on this tradition as follows:\n\n\u0647\u0643\u0630\u0627

There is (in its chain of\n  authorities) one man of questionable reliability {unknown}, he being Sheikh { teacher of; from whom narrates}\n  'Asim b. Umar b. Qatada. That link is also said to have been al-Hasan\n  b. Umara. The tradition is also missing a link, indeed untraceable,\n  between Umar b. 'Abd al-'Aziz and Salman, may God be pleased with him.\n  As for his words, \"If you have told me the truth, O Salman, you have\n  met Jesus son of Mary,\" these are very strange, if not unacceptable.\n  For the period involved must, by all accounts, be one of 400 years,\n  perhaps even 600 years by the solar calendar. The longest anyone\n  suggests that Salman lived is some 350 years. Al-Abbas b. Yazid\n  al-Bahrani  related that the consensus of his elders was that he lived\n  for 250 years;  they differed as to whether it could have been as much\n  as 350 years.  But God knows best. And it seems that he was saying,\n  \"You met a (good) follower of Jesus, son of Mary.\" And that could well\n  be true.\nAl-Suhayli stated, \"The man of questionable reliability (in the above\n  chain of authorities) is al-Hasan b. Umara, a weak authority. But if\n  he was correct, then there is nothing unacceptable about it. Because\n  Ibn Jarir related that Jesus came down again to earth after he had\n  been resurrected { raised up } and that he found his mother and another woman\n  weeping at the cross of the crucified man. Jesus told them that he had\n  not been killed, and after that he sent his disciples.\" He went on:\n  \"And if it is possible that he came down once, then it is possible he\n  did so many times. Moreover there is his evident return when he broke {will break}\n  the cross and killed {will kill} the pig and thereafter married {marry} a woman of Banu\n  Jidham and finally was {be} buried in a chamber of the grave (usually\n  referred to as the garden) of the Messenger of God (SAAS).\"\n\nNote that this translation contains several errors I've added some corrections in {}.\n\n"
