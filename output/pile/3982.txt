    "text": " \nVictoria the Voice\n\nHigh Council Files\n\nEdenia Series\n\nBy Beth Hoyer\n\nCopyright Smashwords 2020\n\nThis is the diary entries of one Victoria Montreal Thunder original copy born of a tube through a female carrying a baby that grew up to be Victoria herself paired to High Council's servant Tom Mindbender Thunder himself. This is the recordings of Victoria's as recorded by her typing onto the computer her laptop her diary entries as ordered by the High Council's recorder of memories.\n\n\"You to sort your books!\" this command emailed to me from Morena Morgan my friend who's stuck close to me like glue.\n\nI emailed her in response \"I don't have anything to do besides collecting books.\"\n\nMorena emailed \"Just find ten to give up.\"\n\nI wasn't in the mood even with an attack of paranoia at the time.\n\nSchizophrenia reared its' ugly head chanting \"Are you forgetting something forgetting some?!\"\n\nThis triggered my paranoia involving not being in private to go off bothering me as a result. Yuck. I didn't feel like sorting my books anyway. I just didn't. I wound up suffering from a voiced attack starting around three o'clock involving the bathroom number two. I was talking to Morena at the time when the attack started.\n\nMorena said \"I urged you to sort books.\" but I wasn't in the mood from the voice's talk and paranoia aggravated.\n\nYuck. I never told Morena that I was sick with a voice attack at the time I talked to her. Instead in the morning I told her by email of that sickness. I'm just waiting for her response. Ugh. Also I saw Dellen's show then around four o'clock I got creepy out by the voice's blaring went to the computer to type till five o'clock is when I went to go take my pills and eat some food. Ugh again. I made a mess onto my clothes involving the food the peanut butter and jelly sandwiches I ate.\n\nI spilled jelly onto the areas of my thighs. \"Yucky! Ugh this sucks.\"\n\nAlso mom text emailed me \"you to call me at seven o'clock.\" which I was creepy out on having to do that while sick with the voiced attack.\n\nI called mom at seven o'clock as asked by her \"I'm sick tonight with me sick with a voiced attack involving the bathroom and voice bothering me.\"\n\nMom said \"I understand love you lots.\" hung up the call and left me to the computer.\n\nI wound up watching TV around nine o'clock till close to ten o'clock pill time is when my paranoia got aggravated so I went to the computer. I was able to go take my pill then attend to my teeth but I didn't wash my water bottle which I could have done that chore. Ugh terrible big time. Also I think around midnight is when the bathroom's attack involving voice quit but I kept on editing one story till my noisy head involving tiredness got too loud for me to concentrate. I went to bed even with that inner noises' blaring. Yuck. Sleep with REM sleep was a long time coming for me. I was sleeping with the voice going off but paranoia not aggravated hence I able to sleep. I slept somewhat poorly with wake ups for bathroom multiple times till around six thirty is when I got up given up on sleep as a result. Baby cute kitten didn't visit me till six thirty is when she visited me. I tried to get her to tummy sit onto my front but she refused and walked off. Aw poor cute baby kitten poor me.\n\nAlso I emailed Morena \"I give my regrets involving sorting books. I was sick with a voiced attack at the time.\"\n\nI'm not sure of when she'll respond to my email. She's been keeping odd hours involving bedtime and sleeping in the morning. Morena is weird sometimes. Oh well.\n\nI emailed Jolica Joliet a teacher from high school who emailed me out of a blue \"You want to talk to me? Kindly email me mews if inclined out of needing someone to talk to.\"\n\nJolica is a teacher from high school that gave me detention I'm still not forgiven her for that detention but she's used cats' pictures with her emails to make me respond.\n\nI wound up emailing her as a result saying \"Hi Jolica hopes your day is good one.\"\n\nJolica said \"My day is sort of boring being in a grocery store as an employee than a teacher.\"\n\nI'm not sure of how Jolica wound up not teaching at the high school and working at a grocery store for a major chain dubbed \"Americaversal\" by the name.\n\nI tried to ask her once \"How did you wound up working at that grocery store than teaching?\"\n\n\"Drop the subject and don't ask again!\" she said in response which I wound up asking Merra in response \"What's going on with Jolica Joliet changing jobs?\"\n\nMerra claimed \"You getting detention from her are why she was fired from her job by people sympathizing with you on that matter. Hence she's doesn't want to be reminded she made a mistake giving you detention and paid for it.\"\n\nI didn't say anything in response to that talk instead got told by Merra \"Just keep communications with Jolica herself out of the High Council insisted out of curiosity that there's such thing as forgiveness. This forgiveness talk is something the High Council is trying to learn and cope with.\"\n\nI obeyed which I emailed Jolica of my day then after that I meant to email other people but I wasn't in the mood to bother. Ugh.\n\nJolica responded with her email that was short and not filled with much to quote home with \"Sounds like a nice day.\"\n\nJolica is hardly talkative with her emails' contents despite I'm very wordy. Morena responded to my email which I was in a chat with her till eleven o'clock is when we both quit. I wound up eating a somewhat sub par lunch that was just finger foods than anything decent. Ugh I had cup candy which I piglet the remainder of the bowl. After that I had some cheese which I'm out of bread at the moment. I do have peanut butter and jelly sandwiches but I'm saving them for dinner than eating them for lunch. I had a nutria grain bar of apple pie or some apple flavor into it. This was tasty stuff I guess. Oh well. I wound up emailing Morena who replied soon after that which I was in a chat with her. I'm still chatting but she's sluggish with her responses. Morena is taking forever to read my email and respond with her messages. Morena sucks big time with that behavior which annoys me. Ugh again.\n\nAlso I ordered a Columbia girl doll called \"Bristol Berlin\" as named which is nice.\n\nI thought that doll would make a nice addition to my dolls' collection. Anyway that doll is a girl of the year doll involving baking or cooking or something I think. I'm not sure of which is which. Oh well. That doll Bristol reminds me of an actress with her facial appearance including her red hair and green eyes. This seems nice I guess with that reminder enough to buy a copy to order. Doll reminds me of actress Charisma Chic with the facial appearance and red hair with the green eyes. I have no idea what to make of that. Ugh here's to hoping I'll have enough money to pay for the remainder of my bills like cable and electricity.\n\nSchizophrenic voice has been saying \"The cable bill would be in the two hundred and seventeen's range.\"\n\nUgh I hope not anyway. I received my monthly paycheck today which totaled into the six hundred dollar range. I'm not entirely sure of the monthly paycheck's increase. Oh I used to get five hundred and eighty five dollars or around that amount but now I'm getting six hundred dollars a month. Seems nice I guess except that cuts my benefits down a bit. Ugh. Anyway I paid my cell phone bill which was almost one hundred dollars. The bill was mostly a few cents off the one hundred dollar mark. Ugh terrible big time to get a brand new cell phone and have to pay outrageous fees for it. Yuck. I wound up downloading stories from Smash-words' website to be saved onto computer out of needing something to do. I meant to get around to reading those stories than collecting them for downloading. Ugh sucks. Also wound up into a chat with Morena who balked replying a minute after I replied to her email message. Morena sucks big time with her cuts offs emails involving talking to me. Ugh really Morena! I was thinking of plagiarizing someone's work as in taking someone's idea to change it into an Edenia series' story or something to amuse myself with. I doubt that I would do that shitty idea.\n\nThe voice says \"Bad idea, not nice!\"\n\nI have to agree with the voice's talk on that idea of mine.\n\nMorena after a lengthy pause ended chat with her saying \"I'm going to clean the fridge\" which she added \"Ciao for now.\"\n\nUgh. Morena sucks with her chatty mood not turning out to be chatty like I hoped she would be talkative. Ugh again. Anyway I had a story involving my own work involving wolves or people who could change into wolves I used part of that story to change into another story involving an alien from moon machinery like planet arriving to planet earth and learning various abilities while there. Ugh. This idea was my own plagiarizing my own story idea into another story idea for another character. I keep doing that plagiarizing of my work over and over. I think this is why my work won't sell online Smash-words' website because the reader knows I'm known for this plagiarizing of my work over and over. Ugh this is the pits. I received my cable bill in the mail which was paid electronically. Oh Yay for that payment. Ooh goody except the bill was like last month's bill one hundred and seventy seven dollars with some change in the late twenties. Ugh terrible. I've still got money left to pay for my electricity bill including other frivolous stuff that won't be a Columbia girl doll since I already bought one. Ugh. I can't afford two Columbia girl dolls as payment. I have to save money for cutesy cat's vet needs including my own personal needs. This stinks when I want to buy another Columbia girl doll but I don't have the money to bother. Ugh this is terrible big time. Ugh I and my big mouth got me in trouble with mom who's known as Bea Beatrice Bee as publicity known while also known as my mother raiser on the phone.\n\nI admitted to mom \"I paid for a Columbia girl doll.\" which she said \"Really Victoria!\" Mom scolded me for buying that doll.\n\nMom said \"I think you should have saved my money for paying off dad instead of buying a doll. I thought you should have saved your money for cat's vet bill appointments than spending money on frivolous stuff like a Columbia girl doll.\"\n\nJeez Louise now she tells me this talk and scolds me.\n\nMom rudely hung up our call around seven o'clock after telling me \"You to go call me back at eight o'clock after checking online for the Columbia girl doll's purchase order and cancel it.\"\n\nUgh.\n\nI might have to lie to mom by phone at eight o'clock \"The doll's purchase order was cancelled.\"\n\nI might have to tell mom what she wants to hear and not anything else involving this purchase order. Ugh sucks. I do hope that mom buys my explanation that I cancelled the doll's order and got part of my money back. Ugh. I don't aim to return that doll once I get it in the mail next week. I aimed to hide that doll into the closet and leave it there like one doll I bought off Columbia girl's website I hid into the closet. This lying sucks big time when I have to do that to mom and see what else I can do involving getting myself onto mom's good graces. Ugh hate lying but I'll tell her what she wants to hear and hope she'll buy my explanation. Ugh terrible.\n\n\"I lied to mom\" Chanted voice after I got off the phone with mom around eight thirty.\n\nI wound up phoning mom around eight o'clock and lied to her when I said \"I did canceled the Columbia girl doll's purchase order.\"\n\nUgh I haven't really cancelled that order instead just let the purchase go through. I'm still determined to have that damn doll around my home for displaying or maybe awhile after I paid dad off that vet bill's debt. Ugh can't wait anyway.\n\nMom whined by phone \"You should have waited till June to bother to buy that doll now. That doll was a girl of the year doll I thought would go on sale in June or later this year.\"\n\nUgh jeez mom for this talks anyway. Oh well ended phone call lying to mom but I don't know if she's got the Source abilities involving detecting a lie like I can occasionally detect lies said to me.\n\nI can tell whenever someone said a lie to me by the voice saying \"Liar!\" into my mind in a female voice sounding like my own thought but not the schizophrenic voice.\n\nI'm told by Tank \"Natasha your mother who birth you had schizophrenic voiced problems something that fascinated the High Council back then to think that voiced problem involving mind walking including hearing other people's thoughts. This thinking turned out to be a chemical imbalance problem in the brain of humans that were declared schizophrenic and not mind walker abilities. This problem is still fascinating to the High Council who suspects mind walker abilities manifesting into schizophrenic individuals who are hearing other people's thoughts besides their own thoughts. This is just a brain problem of individuals whose brain organs have the wrong chemistry that makes them hear voices something the High Council is still interested into.\"\n\nI wound up further hearing Tank laughing cutting the talk like the big three Meritanians Ramses the talker while his sisters Erra and Terra don't talk much did something joker with their mind walking manifestation power abilities. Ugh I also heard Merra who accompanied Tank snickering into my mind too like she's always cued to my mind to hear her all over the place.\n\nUgh I never get a break from her noises despite thinking \"I'm getting a break.\"\n\nI don't get a break as thought only to hear Merra say \"Sticky Vicky you should type this down!\"\n\nFor the records I hate the joker name of \"Sticky Vicky\" shared with Nikolas Thunder himself who hates the name of \"Sticky Nicky\" as blared by Meritanians onto him while their telling jokes. Nikolas Thunder is a hybrid humanoid of a vampire but he can travel during the daylight and not burn up like some vampire species seemed to have problems with the sun. Nikolas got his name from being a cloned copy of Nikolai with my Tom's characteristics as his body but his own facial appearance.\n\nThe High Council according to Tom \"They claim to Nikolas that they created him and used me to create a vampire clone of me that they dub Nikolas Thunder. This is just a lie said to him out of that he came from Humania an obsessed planetary world the High Council is obsessed with and wanted Humanian natives into services of the group. I'm not sure of what the obsession of the High Council towards planet Humania other than they referred the world as home. I figured that Humania must be where the High Council originally originated hence they seemed obsessed with returning to the planetary world.\"\n\nTom cut the talk and wound up walking into my bathroom into my two room apartment I was staying like a rude person without me questioning him further. I did sense a light show come from the bathroom and went to type his talk onto computer or laptop computer. I wound up urged to hit the toilet which I discovered the toilet appearing to be used by a male to my disgust I figured Tom did that either using it or the High Council roped him into doing that joke.\n\nI did sense myself filmed while in the bathroom by voice saying into my mind in familiar female voice \"Your filmed!\"\n\nI'm disgusted that the High Council has the bathroom recorded for Tom's going and arrival. Ugh hence I kept getting that filming talk into my mind. Yuck.\n\nI crashed around nine forty five with a bit of voice going including paranoia going off a bit \"Are you forgetting something forgetting some?!\"\n\nUgh I slept fine anyway with some wakeups for bathroom despite the filming sensed into there with the familiar voice saying \"You're filmed!\"\n\nAlso I wound up tummy sat by the baby cute kitten that came and visited me then tummy sat me lying in bed. Aw she's so cute when tummy sitting. I love that little shithouse fur ball galore. She's a cute little stinker even when's she stinks up the cat's bathroom that was into my bathroom.\n\nI put her kitty litter box I nickname \"Dumperium\" into my bathroom despite Tom kept stepping into it whenever he appeared into light shows of Meritanians' transportation.\n\nTom kept whining to me \"The Meritanians keep transporting me into that damn box like it's a signed arrival place despite I kept finding me into it. I hate that the cat's litter box is still insisted to be left into the bathroom by the Meritanians who need a place to concentrate onto whenever they transport me to there Argh!\"\n\nAnyway I phoned mom twice this morning.\n\nAt first she ignored me so I left a message saying \"Hi its Victoria hopefully text email me mews phone wise. Let me know what's planned for today.\"\n\nMom has today off from her grocery store job something that seemed popularity done among natives in the state of Long River Place which is to work into a grocery store.\n\nThe second call mom picked up to whine \"I'm cleaning my bathroom floor. I would come up to see you once I'm done with that chore.\"\n\nI hope she does come up to see me. Ugh.\n\nMom went to visit Auntie Berliner's apartment as said by her sister or cloned copy on the phone who kept call short as two minutes \"I'm driving and can't be on the cell phone.\"\n\nAuntie Berliner is named Berry Beatrice Bee but she hates the nickname of Barry associated with her name of Berry hence she's said \"Just call me Auntie Berliner.\"\n\nUgh also driving while on the cell phone is not a good habit hence I agreed to hang up the phone and wound up waiting for mom's arrival.\n\nI called town library \"I'm calling to ask for Verona Vander's seven series book 'Seven times bangers'.\"\n\nThat book was a movie's script book out now. Nice I guess.\n\n\"We don't have that book but we'll inter library loan that book from another library.\" as said by librarian which I said \"Okay that's fine with me.\"\n\nI hung up after Librarian asked me \"Anything else I can help you with?\"\n\nI said \"No thanks!\" and hung up.\n\nI'm glad that the library is inters librarian loan Seven times bangers which is good I guess. Oh well. Mom arrived into my apartment which she gave me some stuff like two books. One book turned out to be useless because mom ripped out some stuff from it so I doubt I would be reading that thing very much. Ugh again. Anyway today was mom's little Lancemas the feast of the three sisters. Mom already gave me her little Lancemas' gift earlier which I gave her a free lunch at Dublin Donuts using my gift card.\n\nMom at Dublin Donuts wound up saying \"I'm insisting onto my choice of food menu to eat for our meals but you can pick your own drink.\" which was strawberry milk.\n\nTasty stuff but I think I didn't care for the food which was taco wrapping cheese and egg together. Ugh no wonder I was sick in the toilet soon after eating that food. After eating was library where I remembered I had two library books at home waiting for me to read. Both books aren't due till the twenty third this month. Oh Yay me for being halfway through one of those books. Ugh after library was to Torrington as the town is referred as Torrin's Ville by the High Council to a store for crafts called Shy Shanna's. Shy Shanna's is the name of the craft store despite unsure of where the name came from. The store is where mom and I took a look through that store. I found beads on sale but I didn't buy anything.\n\n\"I considered buying pins for you using my gift card.\" I told Mom.\n\nMom handled the pins and said \"Their too heavy for me to wear. So save your money don't buy anything for me.\"\n\nUgh no wonder the cloned ladies who work in the store were glad to see mom and I leave by relief expressions seen on their faces when we both left through the exit. Ugh I swear our browsing for handling items was causing the store clerks to become uncomfortable out of we both not buying anything. After we went to Shy Shanna's was Stephanie's an office like store where I took a look through that store for spiral bound notebooks. I didn't find what I wanted but I found two notebooks to use as journals which were on sale.\n\n\"Do you want a bag for them?\" The sales clerk wrote down his request by post it pad note instead of talking to me.\n\nI guess mom must have told him when I wasn't looking \"You to write down your request.\" which he did.\n\nNice of mom to tell him that but I don't know if mom told or he figured out himself.\n\nOh well I confess that mom habitually tells people \"You to write down what your saying to me and my daughter.\"\n\nMom has a slight deafness hearing problem involving hearing hence she's insisting on these written notices towards people. She's still treats me like I can't hear at the time which I can hear. Problem is I have a little trouble telling the difference from what I'm hearing by ears and what I'm hearing by my mind as in Meritanians' snickering jokes including schizophrenic voice. I figured that writing down requests is a good way to figure out what the person wants from me hence mom's insisting. Anyway the two notebooks and stickers I bought were on sale for a nice discount. Cute I guess. I aimed to use them for journaling or maybe sticking notes from people into them for saving for later uses. After Stephanie's I think we went to grocery shop for food which I bought around twenty nine dollars worth of food from my credit card set aside for buying food with. Oh Yay me.\n\nMom got me home \"I noticed you looked sad and upset about something.\" as said to me.\n\nI whined to her \"I think the cancellation notice of the purchased doll didn't go through. I think the Columbia girl company was still sending the doll.\"\n\nShe took the news fine but scolded me \"You shouldn't be buying that doll when you should have paid off your debt to dad.\"\n\nUgh dad is Rob Marina as that cloned Lance Richard copy aka known as Jinks Montreal that currently lives in the same town as me but into a house down the road from my apartment.\n\nAlso mom insisted \"You to see my ex-husband as your father.\"\n\nThey used to be paired together into marriage to raise me but since I'm a legal adult their no longer paired together and still on cordial terms using me as an excuse to get along. I'm not privy to the details of their separation but they refused to talk about the divorce as marriages' breakups as referred to as called. I suspect their still legally married but their not together in the same residences. Oh well.\n\nI tried to ask Merra once \"Why my mother and father raisers still legally married despite living separated?\"\n\nMerra in response gave up laughter and dumped me into the town of Win Ville's Lake Highlander Lake as referred by the High Council instead of answering my question. I wound up dumped back into my apartment onto my bed spilling water everywhere. Ugh my bed required bed stuff changed for fresh clean ones. Also my residence cat I dubbed Samantha Black was no where to be seen which I figured the transportation scared her hence she's hiding.\n\nI figured right then that the Meritanians were ordered \"you to dump Victoria into Highlander Lake if she asks an inappropriate question.\"\n\nI also figured that the subject of mom and father raiser's marriage was not to be said or answered by the Meritanians who would dump the asker into the nearest body of water like a joke.\n\nUgh Mom cut her visit short in response to my talk of that doll she saying \"I'm still furious with you to ordering that doll you can't return. I insist that you to call me at seven o'clock tonight.\"\n\n\"I will as you want mom.\" I said which she left slamming the door to the apartment including I felt the vibrations of the stairwell door downstairs bang shut.\n\nUgh a neighbor had to ring my doorbell flasher put there by Mom who said \"You can't seem to tell the difference from the noise of your head and your ears so use that thing.\"\n\nThe doorbell flasher went off an hour later which I found a neighbor Matilda Marie as she's referred to handing me a note she thinking \"Your deaf and can't hear me.\" as said by Merra mind scanning at the time.\n\nThe neighbor after handing me the note bid me bye and left.\n\nI read the note which said \"Please refrain from door slamming! Neighbors are sensitive to the noises!\"\n\nI figured I'll tell mom by phone not to door slam the door next time which once the time was six thirty she text emailed me to phone her.\n\n\"Call mom!\" she said by message around six thirty.\n\nUgh I was on the phone a deaf typewriter like phone with mom for over an hour till fifteen minutes to eight o'clock is when mom whined \"I want to get off the phone and go read a book.\"\n\nShe's a big reader of books despite I find that reading sometimes helps me forget the inner noises' blaring voices. I got the phone and didn't do much besides reading \"Seven Fold\" by Verona Vander with the TV on blaring. \"Seven Fold\" by Verona Vander is a part of her seven book series of seven books. Seven Fold is a sequel to the movie \"Seven Daughters\" involving a baby girl with a mark onto her arm. The baby girl is prophesied to grow up to destroy an evil witch queen to death. Something cute I guess. Anyway I read \"Seven Fold\" till ten fifteen is when my noisy head involving tiredness got too noisy for me.\n\n\"Are you forgetting something forgetting some!\" chanted the voice getting very loud that I couldn't read my book anymore.\n\nI quit for bed taking that book with me to my bedroom in hopes of reading more of it if I couldn't sleep. I slept fine as a result. Saturday or referred as Cat's Day was a gloomy day filled with rain and cloudiness that depressed me. I didn't go out at all as a result. Also my cutesy cat hid galore while I was at home watching junk on the Home and Garden Channel I favored involving a favored show involving the actress Charisma Chic marathoning till three o'clock is when they went to show something else involving twins dubbed Chip and Dip odd names. I think cute baby kitten was hiding in response to the stormy weather outside. She's scared brainless of those rainstorms. Poor baby cute kitten aw.  \nCat's Day was a fiasco with the voice chanting on and off all damn day which annoyed me \"Are you forgetting something forgetting some?!\"\n\nThe voice's chanting had cutie avoiding me and hiding from me in response to that noisy issue including the stormy weather. Yuck. I wound up during the afternoon heavily reading Anna Alina's vampire series The Bloody Diaries reading book two with interruptions of cute baby kitten coming to lap sit me twice. She resumed hiding as a result as I went to resume reading that damn book. I read like one hundred and fifty pages of the library book within two hours with a break to entertain the cutest cat sitting onto my lap. Aw cute.\n\n\"Call Mom\" as text emailed me around six thirty to phone her which I did.\n\nI was on the phone for around an hour or fifteen minutes till eight o'clock is when mom said \"I insisted on getting off the phone.\"\n\nMom whined to me by phone \"I missed my work shift because of issues in the toilet hence I unable to go to work.\"\n\nUgh a pity anyway.\n\nMom said \"I scolded myself.\" while on the phone that \"I could have gone to work and taken some medication for my upset stomach.\"\n\nA pity!\n\nAfter our phone call the TV showed that annoying show that always gets voice chanting results of that house contests' show saying \"Love it! List it!\"\n\nI saw that the show the TV was airing that night was reruns boring me to tears actually.\n\nThose reruns had me reading a book by Michelle Michael for over an hour. I think around eight forty five is when I recognized the nine o'clock episode was going to be a rerun I read Michael's book till a bit till ten fifteen or ten twenty is when I crashed. Ugh. I slept fine till morning from ten thirty to eight forty five in the morning. I did get visited by the cutest cat only once in the morning but soon after she visited me I woke up and got up and started my day. Aw cute of the baby cat to remind me to get up and get out of bed.\n\nSunday was just a day I spend staying home bored to tears including watching TV and entertaining the furry bundle of fur.\n\nI phoned mom and left a message onto her answering machine saying \"Hi its Victoria kindly text email me mews phone wise ASAP.\"\n\nMom had today off from work but her text emailed me \"I've gone to church.\"  \nShe didn't respond to my pleading message around ten thirty \"Mom I want a phone call so text email me!\" till noon is when she finally text emailed me \"Call mom!\"\n\nI was on the phone till around one o'clock is when mom whined \"I want to go take a nap. I'm tired from my sick day on Cat's Day.\"\n\nThis is a pity towards mom for being tired. Oh well poor Momsy. Anyway I wound up into a chat with Morena till two o'clock is when she rudely cut me off without a commentary of goodbye or anything. Morena sucks big time with her rude cuts offs involving online chat options. Ugh. Also I think I was lap sat by the cute baby kitten multiple times today. I think the cutie was trying to make up for not being social yesterday hence her lap sitting happy behavior today. Poor baby cute kitten poor me.\n\nLast night I read Verona Vander's book seven banger times for an hour till like nine thirty is when my noisy head got too noisy for me to concentrate onto that book. Ugh turned out to be number two in the toilet around that time hence I had to watch TV for thirty minutes till ten o'clock is when I crashed with the alarm clock attached to me. I set alarm clock for seven o'clock in the morning which woke me up fine. I didn't care to shower early as seven thirty. Yuck but I didn't care to take my pills early as eight o'clock with globs of chocolate spread to help my appetite when I walk around town. Also when I walked to the highway sidewalk I found my missing water bottle sitting on the sidewalk. I hauled grocery cart full of books yesterday to school which I gave to Morena then I hauled that empty thing carrying my water bottle to home. The water bottle fell out I found out when I got home hence I looking for that thing on the way to the doctor's office. Oh Yay for me for finding that thing. I instead of carrying that thing around town walked home and put that water bottle onto the window still in the stairwell and resumed walking to my doctor's office. The weather snowed a bit on the way but not much snow to cancel schools or plow roads or require booties. I wore my sneakers instead of booties. Oh well. Also I went to doctor's office with sore thighs. My thighs and legs whined in pain from three days of grocery cart hauling books to school. I think due to the snow I didn't haul grocery cart with me this time. Oh well again. I got to doctor's office fine but Stephanie Stephens the secretary had to write a note involving the doctor's lateness due to traffic.\n\n\"The doctor will be late arriving from traffic.\" She wrote.\n\nThe doctor arrived ten minutes pass the nine o'clock time for appointment and didn't see me till five minutes later. Ugh. Also last night read Verona Vander's book and wound up finding that book by e-reader downloaded fine including setting the e-book to where I was in that paper version. I didn't bother to read that e-book while I was out and about town or at the doctor's office or at school either. Ugh. I wound up at the doctor's charging e-reader because the battery was early ninety or around eighty nine percent so I charged that thing till doctor's appointment was over with is when I quit that charging. I found the charging made it to ninety seven percent than one hundred percent. Damn it.\n\nAfter the doctor's the voice picked onto me saying \"Are you forgetting something?\"\n\nI ignored and went to a small grocery store to take a look around. This visit was my first time to that grocery store but I didn't find anything worthy of buying like fruits or anything so I didn't buy anything. Oh well dumb me. I went to the bank and gave the teller forty bucks worth of coins and small bills together totaling forty dollars. I got forty dollars in twenties back. I figured I'll use one to pay dad the debt while I use the other for buying much needed restocking of stuff at home.\n\nI went to school to Morena's office which she told me \"I scold you for showing up at my office. I don't want you showing up at my office anymore because of people's nosiness noticing you visiting me. I was appearing to be socializing and not working hence I'm insisting you not show up anymore.\"\n\nUgh a pity hence she doesn't want me visiting her in her office. I went to the school library's computers to use for the internet's chat option which I pinged Morena.\n\nMorena pinged me back saying \"I'm fine with you chatting with me electronically but not in person in my office.\"\n\nOh well. I chatted with Morena electronically for an hour till eleven thirty or around that time I signed off and went to Dublin Donuts for buying lunch which was a bagel and cream cheese using a gift card. I went to the drug store to buy a candy bar using a gift card I was planning on eating in front of Morena but didn't bother doing that.\n\nMorena once we met for lunch in the caf\u00e9 started whining \"The government shutdown affecting people's food stamp card's money. I want you to avoid buying junk and being frugal with the food stamp card's money including the same with you buying of junk too.\"\n\nUgh.\n\nMorena added \"I think the government shutdown would affect your food stamp card's money not being reloaded for next month.\"\n\nUgh terrible. After lunching with Morena I walked to drug store for pill refills which costs me eight bucks and fifty cents I had to use my own card to pay for because I couldn't find my gift card sitting into my wallet. Ugh sucks. I need to organize my damn wallet of its cards and stuff. This fact that I can't seem to find any cards involving gift cards in that thing is giving me trouble. Yuck. I had forty dollars but I opt not to spend that money instead I saved that money for dad to pay for cat debt bill including saving for the cutest cat's vet bills too. Ugh. After drug store I walked home and at home I was sick in the toilet with number two that got the voice going triggering my paranoia off. Yuck I was sick in the toilet twice with the voice and paranoia going off. I think around two thirty is when this paranoia's aggravation quit but the bathroom continued. I had that candy bar I shouldn't have bought from drug store.\n\nThis is something Morena said \"I've been whining to people to save their money for food and stuff and being frugal.\"\n\nUgh. Around three o'clock before Dellen's show I was doing business in the toilet which the voice didn't comment a word in response to that nerve always going off with number two. I'm surprised that the nerve for number two didn't trigger the voice to go off around that time. Ugh. I watched Dellen's show which she's funny as always. Cute show anyway. I saw almost an hour of local news till around five o'clock is when the mailman arrived with Bristol Berlin the Columbia girl doll I ordered which I couldn't cancel out the order. I instead of mailing back the box for money back threw the box out with a journal I finished the other day. As for the doll I took her out of the box and displayed her onto a bookcase. Oh well. I meant to tell mom by phone that I got a Columbia girl doll but mom threw an angry fit while on the phone when I told her I ordered one. I didn't bother to tell her that the doll as ordered came into the mail today. Oh sucks. Also around six o'clock after dinner I called mom and was on the phone for an hour till seven o'clock a new operator came onto the phone line that made mom hung up.\n\n\"Mom I requested a callback.\" which mom said \"Call at seven thirty for me to use the facilities.\" This was done.\n\nMom and I were on the phone for thirty minutes talking about books till mom said \"I insisted I wanted to hang up.\" which the operator a male rudely typed \"SK.\" symbol than let me say a word.\n\nI said my traditional message \"I love you lots Momsy Bobsy.\" without knowing if the operator was still connecting our call or not and then hung up.\n\nUgh damn the operator for their rudeness. I got into pajamas as a result then I emailed Jolica my damn day's outing stuff then I figured since I was chatty with my email to type a journaling entry into my journal.\n\n\"Ooh what Columbia girl doll did you get?\" This is Jolica's response to my lengthy email.\n\nShe didn't stick around for me to reply or not reply. I meant to reply to that email but I'm just not entirely sure if Jolica would read that email tonight if I reply. Oh well.\n\nI went to organizing my books and dolls and toys around my home. I put the already read books into bookcases into my bedroom then I put the clutter on the dining card table into the dresser next to the table. Oh Yay me. Also opened a window and aired out the dust stirred up in here for thirty minutes till I froze cold and shut that thing. I turned on the heat and went to eat food for lunch including sending people emails. Oh nice. I sent Morena and Jolica emails of my day organizing clutter around here then after that I didn't do much besides chasing the poor baby cute kitten for a kissing and hugging faced ritual. The baby cat balked and ran off out of my reach and out of my sight. Dumb me.\n\nI'm home sick waiting forever for word from mom for a phone call tonight. She didn't picking up the phone at six o'clock. Ugh hence I'm stuck home waiting for her to text email me mews ASAP. Mom didn't picking up the phone at seven o'clock when I ranged her up. Ugh this is really an annoying habit of mom to do towards me when's I'm sick with a voiced attack and don't need this phone call ignorance of mom's.\n\n\"Are you forgetting something forgetting some?!\" sang voice creeping me out.\n\nMom text emailed me around eight o'clock \"Call mom.\"\n\nI whined \"I'm working onto a story.\" as an excuse to get off the phone with her. Ugh jeez mom for falling for that trick like always. Ugh mom hung up as a result which I wound up onto the computer.\n\nSunday was a fiasco with me sick with the voice involving the nerve for number two. I think around six o'clock is when the paranoia got aggravated enough to bother me including mom's unwillingness to text email me ASAP. Ugh. Mom's texting lateness drove the voice to blare too much including scaring me too much too. Yuck once I was on the phone with mom around eight o'clock I whined to mom of working onto a story which she took that excuse fine then got off the phone. After that excuses of a phone call I wound up working onto a story till nine forty five is when the bathroom quit and voice quit attacking me. Ugh something I've eaten must have bothering me as a result. Ooh goody. Also I worked onto my story till like ten forty five is when I went to lie down which I didn't sleep very good. I think I was nervous involving the voice's blaring that I slept somewhat poorly till six forty five is when I woke up and wound up saving my work onto disk by computer. Ugh.\n\nLast night I wound up reading one hundred pages of an e-book till five o'clock dinnertime. I read seven fold book seven series. Oh Yay me. I did check out the paper version of Vander's book but I have yet to crack that open to read. Oh well this stinks big time to check out books I have already the e-book version. Ugh. How greedy of me to check out books I already have the e-book version of. Ugh again. Anyway I read that e-book till five o'clock is when my noisy head got too noisy for me. I had to go take my pills and go eat dinner which I did. I ate four slices of buttered toast and some blueberries. Ugh screw the fact that I had to eat with the voice going off. Also I noticed around the five o'clock hour I keep wounding up sick in the toilet with number two that triggers the voice to go off including ruining my appetite to eat anything decent like fruits and vegetables. Ugh.\n\nSometimes the voice comments \"You having the e-book version of a paper version book you shouldn't check out from the town library.\"\n\nLike Verona Vander's book seven banger times when I got commentary after I tried to check out the library's version. I already have the e-book version I'm not reading much of very good. Ugh.\n\nJolica when I asked her \"What do you think of Verona Vander's seven series?\" said \"I raves that Vander's seven series is very good and well written.\"\n\nI already downloaded the series onto e-reader on her advice \"You should get the books their very good.\"\n\nI'm trying to read more of that series but I'm just not keen or in the mood to bother. Ugh I just don't get it why's that series supposedly good according to Jolica which isn't attracting my eye to read the books entirely. Ugh. This is the same for Bristol Berlin the Columbia doll is named after who's an author who writes fiction works.\n\nJolica on my asking by email \"What do you think of Bristol Berlin the author despite there's a Columbia doll named after her?\" said \"I say some of Berlin's books are good like the apartment complex.\" which I could barely get into.\n\nUgh. I just don't get it why's Berlin's books are supposedly be good but I can't seem to make myself read more of her works or any of her books. Ugh sucks.\n\nI asked mom by phone \"Have you heard of this author Bristol Berlin?\"\n\nShe told me by operator interpreting \"I found her books are terrible like a journaling entry that's telling this and that than anything involving descriptive writing. I found one example of that journaling involving her titled book Her Royal Cuteness about cats.\"\n\nUgh I found that book Her Royal Cuteness rather good but heart breaking. I found the book okay enough to rate it a seven out of ten. Ugh too bad mom didn't care for that damn book. Oh well I ended phone conversation and didn't think of doing anything else till Merra's laughter was heard into my mind.\n\nMerra quit her laughter then said \"How about a tale involving dying one?\"\n\nI didn't comment a response for I figured she's always cued towards me to hear her for recording's sakes onto my laptop computer which I waited for her to say something. Instead she became quiet and I wound up typing onto computer a journaling entry out of Merra not saying anything. I emailed dad and Jolica a story a short story I out of needing something to do involving reading and typing. I did save an extra copy of that story to tell it in first person when I get around to that typing status. Ugh. Also baby cute kitten hung around in sight and wound up onto my lap but she got off fast and ran off. Ugh turns out she pooped number two into the cat's bathroom hence her friendly forgiveness behavior. Ugh poor cutie always pulls this friendly behavior onto me after she does number two into the cat's bathroom. Sometimes the voice chants whenever she's finished with number two in the cat's bathroom. Ugh a pity anyway that I have to put up with that damned noisy issue.\n\nAnyway I've managed to text email dad \"Check your email I emailed you an Edenia series short story.\"\n\nDad said in response \"I'm shoveling snow.\"  \nUgh. I did email Jolica that story but that was by regular email than chat's email. Ugh that story was too long for me to email her by Chat's email hence I went with regular email. Ugh.\n\nJolica responded to my lengthy email in Chat's email \"Stay safe and warm.\"\n\nOne time I typed a lengthy email involving my day which she responded with \"Sounds like a good day.\"\n\nI typed another lengthy day's contents email to her in Chat's email which she responded with her twin saying \"Sounds like a good day\" than anything else.\n\nJolica sometimes sucks when's she's not talkative with Chat's email emailing responses. This lack of talkative emails is the same with dad not talkative by texting him \"How was your day?\" which he responded with a short abrupt texting message \"Fine.\"\n\nUgh jeez daddy. Baby cute kitten has gone to hide somewhere at the moment. I'm not sure of where on Mars that baby cutie went to hide. Ugh I guess she's hiding underneath the damn couch again. Dumb cat dumb animal for hiding like that behavior than being social with me. Ugh can't the dumbbell be social than hiding from me?! Ugh what a dumb cat for her avoidance behavior and not being social like I expected her to be. Ugh.\n\nI went online Chat's email pinging Morena saying \"Hi Morena what's mew with you?\"\n\nI wound up into a short chat with Morena but she's whining \"There's power outage at my house this morning into afternoon.\"\n\nPlus I think that's making her internet service not behave when's it's comes to responding to my emails. Ugh.\n\nMorena added \"I'll talk to you later.\" signed out.\n\nI wound up turning the heat back on out of freezing in here. Monday referred by the High Council as Mars' Day is supposedly being freezing cold even though that day is a holiday. Oh well. I'm just not looking forwards to Monday because of that day is a holiday that's bound to make colleges' closed and leave me stuck at home bored to tears and slobbering the poor baby cute kitten with too much kisses and hugs fests. Also leave me bored to tears of the damn TV not showing anything decent besides crummy programs involving sporting events than anything else. Ugh screw the fact that the holidays preempt the talk shows and always show sports than anything decent.\n\nUgh today's a holiday involving civil rights' memory leadership and stuff. Oh well.\n\n\"Call mom.\" I got by cell phone which I wound up onto the phone with mom twice this morning like from nine o'clock to nine fifteen is when she whined \"I have to go to the bathroom. I asked you to call me back at nine thirty.\"\n\nUgh this was agreed.\n\nI did that call back at nine thirty which we were on the phone for around an hour till mom whined \"I needing to get off the phone for starting my car. I'm to getting to work from one o'clock to six o'clock.\"\n\nUgh. Mom's working an early morning work shift tomorrow at six o'clock in the morning so phoning tonight isn't going to be much. I think the phone call tonight will be short to the point and left time for mom to go to bed early for that six o'clock in the morning work shift. This is a pity towards mom having to work that damn work shift. Ugh again. Baby cute kitten wound up slobbered with kisses and hugs fests. The cutie tolerated her paycheck for free eats fine without any protest but wanted out of my arms. I guess she wasn't in the mood for a hugging and a kissing faced ritual. This is a pity. Also I love giving the baby cat kisses and hugs fests. Sometimes the munchkin tolerates those kisses fine including hugs for me to do. Other times she'll run off and hide and avoid me and my kisses and hugs fests' mood. Ugh quite a pity anyway. Aw baby bun kin was on the couch then she went and hid somewhere. I guess she's fed up with me slobbering her with kisses and picking her cuteness up for hugs she doesn't feel like tolerating. Hence the munchkin has gone to hide and avoid me and my mood. Ugh I love that little munchkin bunches enough to pick her up for hugs and kisses. I love it when's the kitten's tolerant of the kisses and hugs. Aw she's so cute. I had the heat on all night and now I had to turn that off out of sweating bullets by armpits. Ugh this is a yucky feeling to feel involving the sweatiness of armpits. Ugh. I wound up watching HG while eating lunch till noon is when I went to the computer to send emails. I sent emails to people but not Morena or Jolica.\n\nMorena whined earlier \"My house having a power outage hence internet isn't good.\" while Jolica wasn't too talkative with my previous emails' messages \"Sounds good.\"\n\nUgh. I finally sent emails to Morena and Jolica.\n\nIn Jolica's email I said \"I alerted you that I emailed you two Edenia series' stories for you to read when's you have time.\"\n\nUgh nice. Too bad Morena doesn't have an email account for me to send her Edenia series stories for her to read because she whined to me \"Smash-words' website giving me trouble downloading your free stories.\"\n\nI had to tell her \"You to use Barnes and Noble's website for downloading my stories online Smash-words.\"\n\nUgh hopefully that helped Morena download my free stories. Bah humbug to the fact that I'm stuck amusing myself at home out of unable to get outside walking around town or the driveway. The weather left ice all over the place including heavy snow too. Yucky weather!\n\n\"Call mom.\" I got which I called mom.\n\nAnyway mom by her phone call said \"There's ice on the driveway giving my car trouble driving out.\"\n\nUgh poor Momsy Bobsy with her car. Oh well. Mom's car is nothing but a rusty junk bucket that beats eggs around the bushes and never seemed to be worth its job driving for mom. Yuck. Also I said jokes to mom by phone which I meant to use those jokes into a story and seeing what I can do involving those jokes I said.\n\nOne joke I said \"You should be getting a taxi and taxing around town like a taxi cab driver.\"\n\nOh well. Cute joke anyway.\n\nAlso sometimes I say jokes \"You should be gulping peach pits and spitting them out.\"\n\nI said that joke but I said \"peach pits should be spit onto the stairs leading to a church.\" involving something in the Edenia series.\n\nOh I think I said that as an insult than a joke. Oh sucks. I sent emails to people then after that I don't know what to do today besides annoying the cutest cat ever with kisses and hugs fests. That's it if the cutie is around for me to do that annoying behavior onto her cuteness that doesn't care for it. Ugh poor kitty poor me. I must be bored to tears that I'm just not sure of what to do besides slobber fest the kitty with kisses and picking her up for annoying hugs fests she's not in the mood for. Ugh poor kitty poor me for being bored enough to annoy the poor cat. Ugh. I wound up with an attack of paranoia involving me sick in the toilet with problems hence I not able to do much tonight besides type onto the computer.\n\nI had an attack of voice Man's Day night into Terri's Day morning hence I never once slept into bed. I wound up with that damn attack out of sickness in the toilet with number two. I think around five o'clock is when the attack blew off. Yuck. Also I didn't go to bed instead I stayed up watching the news's programs on CBS channel till seven thirty is when I drank a chocolate milk drink then entertained the furry kitty onto my lap. Aw cutie is so cute when's lap happy. Aw love my little munchkin bunches to slobber fest kisses and hugs onto her cuteness. She's tolerant of her paycheck for free eats with being tolerant of my kisses and hugs' fests mood. Aw cute. After the attack I wound up napping three times one was an hour nap. Also around twelve o'clock I went outside to do laundry in the laundry's room despite the weather being cold outside. At least I waited till afternoon to do laundry out of how cold it'll be in the morning. Ugh.\n\n\"Hi Morena how are you?\" I was in a chat with Morena in the process of doing laundry.\n\nMorena said \"I nagged you to vacuum the apartment which you should for your cat's sake. I nagged you for I think your cat's big bald spot onto her tummy was from you not cleaning your apartment very often very good.\"\n\nUgh this stink big time. After vacuuming I replaced the kitty litter to Samantha Beatrice's bathroom which cutie pooped twice into there and has yet to pee. Oh well. I guess that's a nice thank you for cleaning out her crap. Oh well again. Anyway after that cleaning I threw out the vacuum's crap into the trash can in the kitchen cupboards. I talked to Morena till three o'clock.\n\n\"I have to go home to attend an eye doctor's appointment.\" She told me ending the chat.\n\nA pity! Also saw Dellen's funny show she's funny. I wound up for dinner around five o'clock eating crappy foods hence I constipated and unable to have results into the toilet till eight o'clock after phoning mom for two hours. Ugh. I was on the phone with mom for two hours with a fifteen minute break for bathroom for mom including resuming the phone call till eight o'clock is when we quit. I wound up in the toilet with problems like diarrhea. Yuck. I wound up with the voice going last night which I read a bit of Michelle Michael's book till nine o'clock is when I focused onto the TV. I watched TV till ten o'clock is when I crashed into bed. Ugh boy was I glad to sleep. Ugh.\n\nI slept for around twelve hours even with the voice picking onto me \"Get up!\"\n\nThe voice insisted \"You to get up!\" but I refused and remained asleep. Ugh.\n\nI had a weird dream involving someone named Denise. She and I were traveling around a town looking for a bookstore. One bookstore was under construction while the other appeared to be a new age shop with those new age's stuff involving candles and crystals. Oh well.\n\nOne guy in a suit there talked to me \"I want something from you.\"\n\nI explained by voice \"Denise and I were deaf.\"\n\nThe guy didn't seem to listen to me for he again asked me \"I'm asking for something.\"\n\nI had to hand over my wire charger for cell phone which he took fine. Ugh. Also Denise wound up onto her laptop highlighted by a projector screen's light signing onto that thing. I don't get it that dreams involving Denise.\n\nI dreamed of going to a beach to sit in chairs with a couple appearing to be fighting that refused to talk to each other despite me saying \"I'm insisting that you to talk.\"\n\nI wound up doing arts and crafts involving pottery and went to find a kiln for firing that pottery into. One person wound up leading me through a school's building that was on the beach to a kiln which the pottery kept changing designs whenever I carried it to the kiln including into the machine for firing that piece of art. Ugh don't get it my mind anyway. I made a sporting games' themed piece of pottery using my name and the rings but my mind kept changing the piece of pottery all over the place's design. Yuck. I wound up onto a boat which I handed the boat's driver my umbrella like it was payment for boarding into a bin. After that I went to sit down but had to exchange my seat because an old man needed to sit there. Ugh. The boat ride was through the night with the sky blurring of stars streaking though the sky. Also there was an owl like shaped drone machine that floated above the boat only to crash into it out of getting out of juice. Someone aboard the boat took that owl drone and threw it overboard. After the boat ride was done I reached land to find my umbrella in a bin which I couldn't find despite taking out several umbrellas. I wound up picking up an umbrella then taking it to disembark the boat and reached a boardwalk with a city. I followed the old man to a restaurant where he sat at a table. I went to another table to sit and met other people there which I wound up waking up as a result. Ugh.\n\nI did have some idea of me holding onto an umbrella while seated at the table only to get someone yanking it from my hand yelling at me \"I'm accusing you of stealing that thing the umbrella!\"\n\nYuck.\n\nAround eleven o'clock or earlier I bugged dad to drive me around \"Hi Daddy are you free to drive me around for errands like library drug store and groceries?\"\n\nDad agreed giving me a time of one o'clock saying \"One o'clock pickup.\"\n\nDad arrived five minutes early around twelve fifty five. Ugh he's habitually early like I am with meetings involving Morena and the schizophrenic's club gang at the local college. Ugh. I found three soap opera magazines I won't read because I can use the internet to find out online the synopsis of the soap operas and junk like that so I donated those magazines. I can watch those soap operas on TV to figure out their storylines so magazines are useless for me including canceling the subscription too. Ugh I made sure to scrawl out my name and address to those soap operas' magazines including one on mountain I donated I doubt I would read. Oh well. I made sure the magazines had the names and address scrawled out by marker so they won't be returned to my home. Oh Yay me. Also I picked up four children's books I thought I would read if I get around to it. If not I'll donate those books to the school's library when that's possible. Ugh. I dropped off two books I already have the e-book versions of so I didn't need the paper versions.\n\nThe voice has been picky onto me \"You having paper versions of e-books you shouldn't check out but read by e-reader instead.\"\n\nUgh this is the pits.\n\nAlso voice has been picky onto me \"You having paper versions of e-books when you should be reading by e-reader instead of the paper versions.\"\n\nUgh I meant to get around to reading by e-reader those e-books but I haven't in awhile despite earlier last week I read an e-book for over an hour reading one hundred pages straight. Oh well. I saw a teens' novel at the town library that was newly being checked in which I asked for that book to read.\n\nThe librarian told me \"The book wasn't ready for being checked out. I'll put your name onto the list for that teens' novel.\"\n\nUgh nice.\n\nI went to drug store for pill refills for one pill I'm currently on for schizophrenic's talk.  \nThe drug store's clerk said \"Hi Victoria here's your prescription. You have to pay eight dollars and fifty cents for the pills.\" this is like I seemed to be doing lately.\n\nThis paying for prescriptions is the pits and not what I had in mind to do actually. I just don't like this paying for my pills when I preferred to get them for free like I normally gotten them last year. This year the pills are costing me money something I just don't care for. Ugh. After paying for prescriptions which was by all of a gift card and a part of a twenty dollar bill I didn't buy anything else. I was rather disgusted with the fact that I had to pay for my prescriptions which I left without buying any of the products. Ugh. I went grocery shopping which I think dad bought something then put his item into the car and then resumed going to the grocery store to wait for me. Ugh a pity anyway. Thanks to this stupid government shutdown I have an advance of money into food stamp card this month but in February nicknamed Fabs next month I won't have any food stamp money processed unless this shutdown of the government quits being shut. I'm being frugal with my groceries' food stamp money hence I didn't buy much besides five items for eleven dollars. Ugh I guess I'll be frugal for awhile. Oh well. I tried to buy ten dollars worth of groceries but I went over that amount by a dollar and twenty five cents. I'm not buying much food nowadays. I'm trying to buy food for ten dollars or less till I get my food stamps restored. Ugh. I'm trying to avoid piglet onto food so I can make it last awhile till the time for grocery shopping arrives. Hence I bought food from the discounted food reject bin and that was just muffins I aimed to freeze into the freezer and eat for dinner with some spread for them. Oh well. Also cutesy cat's got a vet appointment for tomorrow because her bald spot onto her tummy has gotten worse off instead of hair growing the spot's gotten more bald and bigger. Ugh hence I had to schedule a vet's appointment to figure out what's going on with the poor baby cute kitten. Aw. I love my cutesy cat enough to slobber kisses and given her hugs' fests. She's so tolerant of the hugs and kisses like the behavior is her paycheck for free eats and a free warm body to cuddle bum with whenever she's cold and wants my lap. Aw love my cutesy cat the baby bundle of fur bunches. She's so cute. I only have two subscriptions to two magazines I cared about which one is on gymnastics my favored sport and the other is on science fiction fantasy. I like both magazines their good reading anyway. Even annoying is fantasy and science fiction magazine keeps on rejecting my work.\n\nI kept getting voice saying \"Enjoys your work but won't publish them.\"\n\nI keep getting this commentary involving whatever works I sent to that magazine which cans be anything involving poetry and Edenia series' stories. Ugh. I'm not happy that the magazine keeps on rejecting me and refuses to accept any of my work into their magazine. This is an annoyance whenever I keep on submitting stories and poetry to them but they keep giving me excuses to reject my work and balk accepting. I feel like their rejecting my work on purpose because I'm self published online smash-words' website something they don't care for and don't want anything to do with. Ugh.\n\nDrat the fact that the magazine according to dad \"They want to make money.\"\n\nI whined to dad once \"They keep on rejecting my work.\"\n\nThis was what dad's response to my whining. Ugh. I'm not happy that I have to enter contests into their magazine including trying to get already published work reviewed into fantasy and science fiction magazine. I got refusals on that reviewing as a result. Ugh damn the editor for that damned balking. Also annoying is no one's taking me seriously as a writer. I keep on posting links to smash-words' stories but no ones bothering to like those links even if I post them online.\n\nI once posted \"I finished a seven thousand word Edenia series story\" online.\n\nHardly anyone bothered to acknowledge or like that status. Damn those idiotic people for their damned ignorance. Also annoying is when I posts about my Edenia series online I receive ignorance and no one bothering to like my statuses. I feel like my writing career posts online are ignored and dismissed and not given any support. Only Morena supports me with that posting and likes links but anybody else is careless and don't care towards me or for me and my writers' life posts.\n\nI've been tempted to post something saying \"Like this status or be deleted.\"\n\nI'm just not happy with the ignorance online involving the Edenia series' works I do including anything involving my writing career too. Ugh.\n\n\"Read 78 pages of 'Cold Snap' by Allison Brennan last night\" my post online.\n\nI'm hoping I would get someone else besides Morena liking that post. Ugh. Only Morena likes my posts with someone else occasionally likes my posts but that's not all the time occasionally. Oh well. Also went online smash-words' website and downloaded three stories that seemed to be erotica porn like which were free. Oh well their by Janna Japan who's got thirty five people favoring her online there. She's lucky people favored her involving her erotica porn stories. Ugh. So far eleven people have favored me as a result of self publishing over one hundred stories online smash-words. Most of those stories are for free while some are for fees that aren't selling. Ugh damn the public for their insistence of wanting my stories free. Ugh. I feel like something I've typed into my stories' paragraphs' contents are turning off readers from buying my stories with fees. Instead this is making them prefer my stories to be free. Ugh hence whenever my stories are for free their easily bought and downloaded by hundreds and thousands. Ugh.\n\nUgh hence my line \"I'm a best seller of works such as Edenia series that is always downloaded by the hundreds and thousands.\"\n\nI used that line into my biography paragraph to make people think I'm a best seller like a trick when it's not really true. Ugh. I noticed I seemed to get my free stories downloaded by too much like hundreds and thousands while my fees' stories aren't given a damn downloaded status. This sucks big time when I can't seem to convince the public to download my fee stories for samples including buying them. Ugh. I swear something of the stories' paragraphs turn readers off from wanting to buy my stories hence their insistence of the stories being free by how well they download the stories that are for free. Ugh this fucking sucks. Baby cute kitten wound up with a ten thirty vet appointment today. She hid but showed herself while I was on the phone with mom. I wound up snatching her cuteness up and locked her into the bathroom. Poor cute baby kitten didn't like that at all. Oh well. Anyway I talked to mom by phone till close to ten o'clock is when we hung up. I was chatting with Morena by cell phone at the time too but around that time I ended chat on having to put cute baby kitten into the cat carrier. Ugh. I'm glad I locked the baby kitten into the bathroom for she gave me lots of trouble putting her into the cat carrier. Ugh she kept resisting including climbing out of that thing which I had to catch her multiple times till I succeeded in getting her locked into that thing. Ugh again.\n\n\"I'll come around ten fifteen.\" like he said by text email response to my question's text email message \"What time to pick me and cutie up?\"\n\nUgh dad tried a back roads route but the street was blocked so he had to take another back roads' route to the vet hospital. The vet appointment went fine to my relief. Cutesy cat's hair onto her bald spot is growing again and seemed to be improving. Ooh goody. This is the same for her bald spots onto her back end and tail too. Oh Yay for that hair growth. Also after vet saw cutie the bill was only fifty cents less than twenty bucks to my relief. Oh Yay for that the bill was cheap. Ooh goody. I got home and wound up putting the remainder of my one hundred dollar money into book safe. I think I have sixty dollars left into book safe. Oh well.\n\n\"Hi Morena.\" I emailed Morena.\n\nI was in a chat for thirty minutes till eleven thirty is when she rudely cut me off. Ugh jeez Morena for that cuts offs. Ugh. Anyway around eleven thirty I assumed I was hungry because of the noises of my head sounding so I had a banana then fifteen minutes later was sick in the toilet. Yuck to have that problem involving the sickness in the toilet that gets the voice going. Ugh again. I around eleven forty five walked to Mickayla's which I had to use the road to avoid icy sidewalks and snowed areas that weren't shoveled. Yuck. This sucks. Ugh I had to walk with traffic as a result of this damned walk to Mickayla's.\n\nI got to Mickayla's a minute early before Morena arrived with Ted. She could have picked me up and driven me to Mickayla's. Damn Morena for being inconsiderate. Ugh.\n\nAlso food was what Morena said \"I insisted you have non dairy like food.\"\n\nI did bring a bag of cheese with me which Morena paid me five bucks for that.\n\nMorena has been picky onto me \"You should stop eating dairy products. I want you to avoid the cheese eating including dairy products. I want you to see how your body's system would do without that dairy food eating.\"\n\nUgh. I had non dairy food including water to drink like I normally have with my food which is just water than anything else. I was sick in the toilet fifteen minutes after I finished my food. I'm not so sure if Mickayla's food aggravates my stomach to be sick with toiletry sicknesses or that the food I ate for breakfast caught up with me. After eating Mars as nicknamed this student of Morena's that Morena tutors at the local college showed up very rudely and was rudely late. He ordered the same food that Ted ate too but more of the food department. Also Mars got Morena to get me to walk home which she wound up driving him and Ted around for errands. Damn Mars for this rudeness damn Morena for this driving rudeness. I was forced to walk home thanks to the rudeness of Mars' inconsiderate behavior and forced to walk home thanks to Morena and her inconsiderate behavior of her car not having room for me. Thanks a lot you both idiots!\n\nI got home and wound up sick in the toilet with a problem hence I annoyed with Morena and Mars. I worry that I'll walk home while sick with toiletry problems and won't be able to get inside my apartment to use the bathroom despite voice going off out of a medical emergency hitting a neighbor. Ugh. I worry that the emergency crew will be rude and won't let me get inside my apartment once I'm home from a walk.\n\nI worry that they say \"We accuse you of looting someone's apartment!\" when \"I actually live there.\" which they'll say \"Yeah right move along.\"\n\nI also worry that I'll be sick with the voice going off involving the bathroom and can't use the toilet at my apartment thanks to the emergency crew's not willing to let me inside my apartment.\n\nAlso worry that the emergency crew will not be letting me inside my apartment despite I saying \"I live there\" and showing my ID card.\n\nUgh I worry that the emergency crew the cops will arrest me instead and throw me into jail instead of listening to me and my wording involving living at that apartment building. Ugh I hate my worries actually. I worry that when I'm walking home from some place I won't be able to get inside my apartment to rest from the voice's attacking me. I noticed whenever I'm walking home from the library the voice picks onto me including triggering my paranoia to go off bothering me. This is something that bothers me whenever I'm walking home from the town library. Ugh. I hate walking to the town library because of the voice picking onto me while I'm on the way to there. I also hate walking home because of the voice's picky noise whenever I walk home. I just don't care for walking to the town library and walking to home either. Also I get the voice's pickiness whenever I walk a certain road route to home. I always get the voice going picking onto me hence my worries of unable to get inside my apartment to rest and go to the toiletry's business. Ugh. There are some occasions I've managed to walk home and avoid the voice's talk but that only involves me walking fast and having to go number two in the toilet. Ugh. Also I got ten bucks into my wallet for spending money for spending onto junk or just plain old stuff for the cutest cat ever. Aw I figured that'll be my limit involving buying anything in stores just ten bucks. I'm not sure of what to do with the fivers I received from Morena and change. I figured I'll put the fivers some place into my apartment hiding somewhere for me to save on hand for Bea Beatrice Bee the First's honor. Oh well. Grandma Bee always gives me five dollar bills something I'm trying to honor her memory by saving those fivers for her honor. Ugh. Hence I'm just not entirely sure of where to put the fivers I have somewhere around my apartment. Ugh again. I'm more inclined to put the fivers into a cup somewhere and work on saving twenty bucks worth of fives then exchange it for twenty dollar bill from the bank. I figured that'll be nice of me to do that saving including exchanging I guess. Oh well. Baby cute kitten once I was home was around socializing with me. I guess the munchkin wanted to sit onto my lap but I balked on going to type by computer. Ugh did give the baby cutie kisses onto the top of her head. She tolerated the kiss fine. Aw cute. I love that little kitty so much to slobber kisses onto her head including gathering her into my arms for hugs' fests. She's so tolerant of the hugs and kisses. Aw love my little munchkin bunches. She's so cute.\n\nYesterday was mom's day off which I used an operator for deaf to contact her by phone.\n\nMom whined \"You seemed to have trouble telling the difference from what you're hearing by ears and your mind. Just use that deaf relay operator service for contacting me including phoning people.\"\n\nI dialed the operator who said \"Relay operator at your service.\"\n\nI said \"Please dial this number.\" I give the number.\n\nOperator said \"Dialing number.\" This followed by saying \"Ringing one ringing two female 'Hello.'\"\n\nI ranged mom around eight something o'clock and reached her \"Mom you willing to hop and skip to Alaska from Australia?\"\n\nAlaska and Australia is a joke I use onto mom by phone.  \nMom said \"I needing to do errands before coming up to see you so talk to you later.\"\n\nOperator reported \"Person hung up.\"\n\nUgh \"Thanks.\" I hung up.\n\nI watched TV while journaling till eleven o'clock is when mom arrived. She supposed to arrive around ten o'clock to ten thirty but she was thirty minutes late. Ugh she's always late as ever whenever arriving to my home. Ugh again. Anyway mom proceeded to use my computer to look up a business then looked up the Appalachian Trail in state that's in my area of the state. She looked them both up then wrote the information down by notepad. She intended to write that into my journal but I gave her a notepad instead. Oh well. After computer mom drove me to Dublin Donuts where we had mom's choice of sandwich but my choice of drink involving water. Mom had coffee but she barely drank that and had me throw that out. Ugh what a waste of drink anyway. After we finished Dublin Donuts was to library next door mom driving to there and parking in the lot. Mom wound up buying two cookbooks she found. I bought a Terrific Terri book that was in paperback despite already having the hardcover version. Oh well. Once I was done buying the book I picked up a script book of a movie that's a library's book which is a month loaner. I did ask librarian earlier this week for a library book I spotted onto their desk but the book wasn't ready for me to check out. The librarian put me onto the list which I'm not sure of what the list's length of people reading that book is. Ugh.\n\nMom drove partially to a store but she turned around after signing \"Stupid.\"\n\nI wasn't sure of what she meant by that wording including signing that. Oh well. Mom went to Americaversal store where I used that new bag mom gave me including mom buying our stuff. I got gum and something to eat as a dessert while at home. Mom bought our stuff then drove me home where we piglet onto the dessert food.\n\nMom left for home which she told me \"You to call me at six o'clock.\"\n\n\"I agreed on that talk.\" I said.\n\nMom wound up signing \"I love you\" as she left which I said \"I love you Momsy Bobsy.\"\n\nI went onto computer and sent people emails then after that only two responded to my emails while others didn't yet. Oh well. This stink big time when I send emails that people aren't responding to the messages. Yuck. I swear something I said into the emails' contents turns people off from responding. Ugh hence I think this attitude. Ugh again.\n\nI sent a lengthy email regarding my day to Jolica which I ended with \"I'm always chewing gum whenever I'm not home from being out after meals.\"\n\nJolica's response was \"I love gum.\"\n\nUgh she's hardly wordy with her emails towards me. Oh well.\n\nI sent Tommy my boyfriend or paired husband as he's referred to an email mostly a picture of a naked cowboy dancing.\n\nTommy somewhere doing duties for the High Council responded with \"Laughing out loud. How are you doing?\"\n\nI have yet to respond to that email out of that I sent him a joke email earlier and he never responded to that email. Ugh. I sent Jolica an email regarding books but I think that emails' contents had something into it that turned her off from responding. Ugh hence I think my emails to people always turns people off from responding. After emailing I went to watch TV while having the voice picking onto me very loudly that I couldn't think.\n\n\"Are you forgetting something?\" sang voice over and over very loudly that I couldn't think of my own thoughts \"Forgetting some.\"\n\nOne voice said \"Stay home\" in response to me thinking \"I need a hospital visit.\"\n\nUgh that was done which I stayed home than going out to the hospital's emergency room for an entire night's stay before in the morning making up the doctor's mind to admit me or not. Ugh again.\n\nAnyway mom text emailed me around six o'clock \"Call at seven thanks mom.\"\n\nMom must have gone to church hence her seven o'clock phone time request. Ugh. I text emailed dad around eleven o'clock in the morning like always when's I want a conversation with dad.\n\nI said \"Hi daddy. How are you and kitties today? Sam's been lap happy but cute.\"\n\nDad responded with \"We are all fine right now.\"\n\nDad doesn't respond much to my questions of the texting messages with his favorite word \"Fine.\"\n\nUgh dad doesn't say much besides that wording towards me. Ugh again.\n\nAnyway after my outing with mom who left around one o'clock I text emailed dad again.\n\nI said \"Hi dad how's your day going? I'm home with cutest cat roams from being out doing errands.\"\n\nDad said \"At the dump going Americaversal next.\"\n\nMom has told me over and over \"You to not to tell dad that I was visiting you. This is none of his business.\"\n\nUgh I haven't really told dad that I was out with mom driving me for errands but I've emailed Morena and Jolica with that telling included. I wound up barraged by the voice while I was home doing nothing but TV and trying to relax. I wound up talking to mom by phone around seven o'clock even with that barrage going but the paranoia wasn't much. Oh goody that I got to talk to mom by phone then after that I watched HGTV channel junk than animal planet's show. Oh well.\n\nMom was babbling \"I bought two books from library. One was a Terrific Terri's book costing in bookstore forty bucks but I paid fifty cents for it. The book was being a cookbook involving desserts which seemed tasty.\" This talk made me drink lots of water. Ugh. Also whenever mom mentions food to me by phone I get mouth watered cravings hence I have to go gulp some water. This is the same for me gulping water whenever there's a food commercial on TV. Ugh. I was too creepy out by the voice's barrage to tolerate animal planet's show as a result. Ugh wound up watching reruns of \"Love it or List it.\" Both episodes ended with a \"Love it\" result. Ooh goody something I like involving those episodes than ending with a \"List it\" for sale episodes. I don't care for that involving the house going to the real estate agent to sell. Yuck. Around nine thirty, I read a bit of Michelle Michael's book. I think I read for thirty minutes while glancing at the TV for results of stuff then around ten o'clock I crashed into bed and slept till bathroom woke me up. Ugh I woke up with bathroom including a stinging in pain ankle on my right foot. I'm not so sure if I slept wrong or not. Oh well. The pain isn't the first time I've gotten it but I've woken up with the pain multiple times. Ugh the pain is always a pain in the petunia bothering me enough to wake up and start my damn day. Ugh. I could only try two minutes of sleep before I gave up and got up starting my damn day. Ugh I had the heat on all night but turned that off on how warm it'll be in here. Oh well. Local news predicted forties for Sunday then some cold temperatures for the remainder of the week. Ugh. I swear something of my emails' contents always turns people off from wanting to respond hence balking to reply by people. I send emails to people online and sometimes get ignorance to respond. Ugh. I swear like I said that something of my stories' paragraphs online smash-words always turns people off from buying my stories or downloading samples of my stories that are for fees. Hence I always get free stories downloaded for a high number more than my fee stories that aren't downloaded at all.\n\nUgh this sucks big time when I think the stories' paragraphs always makes me think \"Something of the contents turns people off from wanting to buy my stories.\"\n\nThis idea is in place because of downloads of my non fees' stories that are in high numbers. Ugh. I think this status of my stories being downloaded when their free is aggravating me when I can't seem to earn any money off my writings. I can't seem to convince magazines or anybody to publish my work and give me money. Ugh I'm always taken advantage of my writings involving people not bothering to paying me like gymnastics' magazine I submitted an article and they didn't paying me despite having that article into their magazine's February issue. Ugh.  \nI emailed a story to dad and Jolica using line \"Story I don't know what to do with it oh well.\"\n\nSomething I thought of involving the seven series Verona Vander. I thought of one scene during the last seventh book of the series the battler. I also thought of a scene after that book was done with.\n\nA teenaged boy Lance Knight is brought to live with his grandma an old woman in a house which the boy said \"I don't know my heritage or where I was born.\"\n\n\"I tell you a told a story of being born in another world called Aire with cloned copies including your sister Lizette taken out of that world as a baby.\" as told by grandma \"You were considered the heir to the throne of Lance Richard. You the high king heir to the throne despite your sister will be princess with you.\"\n\nLance Knight is somewhat believes the grandma \"I'm not sure of what to make of that story.\"\n\nLance Knight recalls himself as a youngster visiting another world with his sister and becoming king there.\n\nLance Knight realized \"The world is real.\" despite my Aunt Susan said \"That world is fake and calling it a childhood memory.\"\n\nLance Knight realized \"That world is real.\" and realized \"I've got believers into my family remaining sister despite Auntie Susan doesn't believe who is busy being pretty and thinking of attracting people's eyes like a pretty woman.\"\n\nLance Knight realized \"The world is real called by a name Aire.\" which he discussed with his sister who said \"I believes.\" despite pretty Auntie Susan said \"I don't believe.\"\n\nLance Knight asked his Grandma \"I want to discuss that world Aire with you and whoever believes.\"\n\nGrandma said \"I believe the two people who have been to that world themselves which is you and your sister.\"\n\nLance Knight realized \"Aire would be heaven to live in once I'm dead to Terra's world.\"\n\nLance Knight realized that and realized that fact towards the others who believes his talk involving his sister Lizette and Grandma. This story idea takes place after the events of the Battler in the seventh and final book of the series. Susan marries has four children named after deceased in train explosion brothers and sister.\n\nSusan as an old woman dying gets dreams of a lion saying \"I'm demanding you to acknowledge me.\"\n\nFor Susan was in denial about Lance Richard \"I'm calling the god king a children's imagination memory.\"\n\nSusan realized \"Lance Richard the god king is real.\"\n\nShe spoke to her children \"I tells you children of Lance Richard the god king who is real you should believe.\" Who her children somewhat said \"We believe with some disbelief.\"\n\nSusan said \"I acknowledged Lance Richard as my god king.\" dies and joins her family in Edenia as heaven to go to once dead. I wrote the idea involving Susan down into a notebook and finally got around to typing that idea down today this morning. Oh goody for me. I guess that's nice anyway. Ugh I doubt this story would be accepted by a fantasy and science fiction magazine. I think this story's got confusing stuff into it that doesn't make sense despite the contents involves like religious story. Ugh I don't know what to do with that damn story anyway. This sucks.\n\nAlso I emailed Jolica once of another story which she emailed I back \"I'm being confused with the story. The story needs editing which its okay so far from what've read.\"\n\nUgh that story was on \"The Dying One\" I already put into my computer journal earlier. Oh well.\n\nI have yet to receive a response from dad involving the story I emailed him about \"The Dying One.\"\n\nI hate it when dad doesn't bother to responding to my emails as soon as possible. Ugh how annoying. I threw out the garbage including an unfinished notebook of journaling I didn't bother to finish.\n\nI think voice scolded me \"You could have finished that notebook.\"\n\nI maybe I should have finished that notebook but I didn't bother. Oh well. That notebook I didn't finish was originally a worthless sketch book that was only worth a dollar and not five bucks I bought off the Barnes and Noble's bookstore website. I feel like I got ripped off when I bought that journal off that bookstore's website. Ugh. The journal was getting too bent out of shape when I was writing into it including that the notebook didn't have lines for me to write with like some notebooks have. I hated that notebook and I hated writing into it. I was glad to throw that damn thing out even if it was unfinished. Ugh.\n\nI was urged by voice \"You to go take your pills and eat food.\" but I refused on calling mom.\n\nI should have listened to the voice's suggestion because mom picked up the phone at eight forty five in the morning and hogged me to ten o'clock is when she finally quit. Ugh hence voice picking onto me when I got off the phone with mom \"You to go take your pills and eat food!\"\n\nAlso damn Morena \"Hi Morena.\"\n\n\"I'm raving about this archery contest I saw online.\" and then she told me \"The results of women's competition. A Highlander archer won over a First One that was fourteen years old.\"\n\nUgh I guess that's nice.\n\nAlso Morena added \"I want to go watch the men's competition. Talk to you later.\"\n\nShe ended our conversation which I was talking to her while talking to mom by phone. Ugh not impressive because mom asked me \"How old is your cat?\"\n\nI got distracted by that talk with Morena on my cell phone \"Sorry you care to repeat?\"\n\n\"How old is your cat?\" Mom had to repeat her question which I quit the talk with Morena and focused onto mom \"She's thirteen years old.\"\n\nVery rude of me!\n\nAround ten o'clock mom whined \"I needing to go start my car for work at noon.\" which we both hung up.\n\nI finally got to eat taking my pills and eating breakfast which was muffins the remainder of them with butter on top and the remainder of fruit juice. I finished the bottle. Nice.\n\nPlus mom did ask me \"What you had for breakfast?\" which I didn't tell her \"I didn't have breakfast yet/\" instead I claimed \"I had chocolate spread and that fruit juice.\"\n\nThis was a lie but the voice scolded me \"You being a liar. You lied to mom.\"\n\nOnce I was off the phone with mom I had chocolate spread for breakfast making this a truth than a lie towards mom. Oh well. After breakfast I felt sleepy so I took an hour nap by armchair falling asleep face mashed into the armrest out of sleeping comfortably. I don't sleep lying back using the foot rest. I sleep with my face into the armchair's armrest. I always find that easy for me to sleep that position despite this sometimes aggravates my hips.\n\nAround noon I woke up to the noises of my head going off saying \"Are you forgetting something?\" over and over \"Forgetting some.\"\n\nUgh turns out to be my cell phone involving posts from Jolica who posted pictures of something else than pictures of herself and her son or family. Oh well.\n\nI had lunch then after that I thought \"I would figure out what to do besides bugging dad to drive me to the hospital emergency room.\" as suggested by the voice saying \"Hospital.\"\n\nI'm trying to withdraw from eating cheesy foods hence I'm sick in the toilet a lot including suffering from nerve number two making my head sing too much.\n\nI had a singing head yesterday that lasted all afternoon with the chanting blaring \"Are you forgetting something?\" way too much hence I thought \"Hospital emergency room seventh floor?\"\n\nOne voice suggested in response to that thinking \"Stay home wait another day.\"\n\nI obeyed despite one voice today suggested \"Wait till Monday for hospital visit.\"\n\nUgh I've got mental health doctor's appointment coming up in February which I'm not entirely sure of if I can wait that long to whine to the doctor of my voiced problems. Ugh.\n\nBah humbug Bay's Books. I ordered a journal involving the book by Terrific Terri. I ordered that off a goodwill company from Minnehaha from Bay's Books for around eighteen dollars. Ugh. Barnes and Noble's website didn't have that journal for selling plus their used copies cost like thirty dollars and some change something I didn't agree with and went with eighteen dollars off Bay's Books. Ugh again. Also thanks to the trouble of signing into my cell phone's account I went with auto pay option because I kept on having to change my damn password for that damn account. Damn the cell phone's damn account services hence I went with auto pay. I hope I don't regret that paying status. Ugh.\n\nThis is my online blog's entry \"In a Nutshell.\"\n\nOne night I reading one hundred pages of an e-book till five o'clock dinnertime.\n\nI read \"Thievery.\" by Anna Alina book sixteen in her \"Bloody Diaries\" series.\n\nOh Yay me. I did check out the paper version of that book but I have yet to crack that open to read. Oh well this stinks big time to check out books I have already the e-book version. Ugh. How greedy of me to check out books I already have the e-book version of. Ugh again.\n\nAnyway I read that e-book till five o'clock is when my noisy head got too noisy for me \"Are you forgetting something forgetting some?!\"\n\nI had to go take my pills and go eat dinner which I did. I ate four slices of buttered toast and some blueberries. Ugh screw the fact that I had to eat with the voice going off. Also I noticed around the five o'clock hour I keep wounding up sick in the toilet with number two that triggers the voice to go off including ruining my appetite to eat anything decent like fruits and vegetables. Ugh.\n\nSometimes the voice said \"You having the e-book version of a paper version book you shouldn't check out from the town library.\"\n\nLike Anna Alina's book \"Bloody Beautiful.\" when I got commentary after I tried to check out the library's version \"You shouldn't check out the library's version when you have the e-book to read.\"\n\nI already have the e-book version I'm not reading much of very good. Ugh.\n\n\"Hi Jolica what's your opinion of Anna Alina's Bloody Diaries' series book Bloody Beautiful?\" my email to her.\n\nShe replied shortly \"I say Anna Alina's series is very good and well written. You should purchase them by e-book and read them.\"\n\nI already downloaded the series onto e-reader on her advice. I'm trying to read more of that series but I'm just not keen or in the mood to bother. Ugh I just don't get it why's that series supposedly good according to Jolica which isn't attracting my eye to read the books entirely. Ugh. This is the same for this Author Janna Japan's works.\n\nJolica said by email \"Some of Janna Japan's books are good like The House Mouse.\" which I could barely get into.\n\nUgh. I just don't get it why's Janna Japan's books are supposedly be good but I can't seem to make myself read more of her works or any of her books. Ugh sucks.\n\nMom according to phoning talk in response to my question \"What do you think of Janna Japan's works?\"\n\nShe said \"I found Her Royal Cuteness book on cats terrible like a journaling entry that's telling this and that than anything involving descriptive writing.\"\n\nUgh I found that book rather good but heart breaking. I found the book okay enough to rate it a seven out of ten. Ugh too bad mom didn't care for that damn book. Oh well.\n\n\"Hi Daddy let me know what you think of this story.\" I emailed dad a story a short story out of needing something to do involving reading and typing.\n\nI did save an extra copy of that story to tell it in first person when I get around to that typing status. Ugh. Also baby cute kitten hung around in sight and wound up onto my lap but she got off fast and ran off. Ugh turns out she pooped number two into the cat's bathroom hence her friendly forgiveness behavior. Ugh poor cutie always pulls this friendly behavior onto me after she does number two into the cat's bathroom.\n\nSometimes the voice chants whenever she's finished with number two in the cat's bathroom \"Cat pooped clean it up!\"\n\nUgh a pity anyway that I have to put up with that damned noisy issue.\n\nAnyway I've managed to text email dad \"Check your email I emailed you an Edenia series short story.\"\n\nDad said in response \"I'm shoveling snow.\"  \nUgh. I did email Jolica a story but that was by regular email than Chat's email. Ugh that story was too long for me to email her by Chat's email hence I went with regular email. Ugh.\n\n\"Check your email I emailed you a story. I hope your day is a good one despite the cold.\" Jolica responded to my email in Chat's email saying \"Stay safe and warm.\"\n\nOne time I typed an email involving my day which she responded with \"Sounds like a good day.\"\n\nI typed another lengthy day's contents email to Jolica which she responded with her twin saying \"Sounds like a good day\" than anything else.\n\nJolica sometimes isn't that talkative with her emailing responses.\n\nThis lack of talkative emails is the same with dad not talkative by texting him which he responded with a short abrupt texting message \"Fine.\"\n\nUgh jeez daddy. Baby cute kitten has gone to hide somewhere at the moment. I'm not sure of where on Mars that baby cutie went to hide. Ugh I guess she's hiding underneath the damn couch again. Dumb cat dumb animal for hiding like behavior than being social with me. Ugh can't the dumbbell be social than hiding from me?! Ugh what a dumb cat for her avoidance behavior and not being social like I expected her to be. Ugh.\n\n\"Hi Morena how are you?\" I wound up into a short chat with Morena which she said \"I'm worried of power outages at my house this morning into afternoon. I think that's making my internet service not behave when's it's comes to responding to emails.\"\n\nUgh Morena signed out which I wound up turning the heat back on out of freezing in here. Monday is supposedly being freezing cold even though that day is a holiday. Oh well. I'm just not looking forwards to Monday because of that day is a holiday that's bound to make colleges' closed and leave me stuck at home bored to tears and slobbering the poor baby cute kitten with too much kisses and hugs fests. Also leave me bored to tears of the damn TV not showing anything decent besides crummy programs involving sporting events than anything else. Ugh the fact that the holidays preempt the talk shows and always shows sports than anything decent. Ugh. Monday's a holiday involving civil rights' memory leadership and stuff. Oh well.\n\n\"Hi Mom what's mew with you meow?\" I wound up onto the phone with mom twice morning like from nine o'clock to nine fifteen is when she whined \"I have to go eat breakfast. I asked you to call me back at nine thirty.\"\n\nUgh.\n\nI did that call back at nine thirty which we were on the phone for around an hour till mom whined \"I'm to get off the phone for starting my car and getting to work from one o'clock to six o'clock.\"\n\nUgh. Mom's working an early morning work shift tomorrow at six o'clock in the morning so phoning isn't going to be much. I think the phone call tonight will be short to the point and left time for mom to go to bed early for that six o'clock in the morning work shift. This is a pity towards mom having to work that damn work shift. Ugh again. Baby cute kitten wound up slobbered with kisses and hugs fests. The cutie tolerated her paycheck for free eats fine without any protest but wanted out of my arms. I guess she wasn't in the mood for a hugging and a kissing faced ritual. This is a pity. Also I love giving the baby cat kisses and hugs fests. Sometimes the munchkin tolerates those kisses fine including hugs for me to do. Other times she'll run off and hide and avoid me and my kisses and hugs fests' mood. Ugh quite a pity anyway. Aw baby bun kin was on the couch then she went and hid somewhere. I guess she's fed up with me slobbering her with kisses and picking her cuteness up for hugs she doesn't feel like tolerating. Hence the munchkin has gone to hide and avoid me and my mood. Ugh I love that little munchkin bunches enough to pick her up for hugs and kisses. I love it when's the kitten's tolerant of the kisses and hugs. Aw she's so cute. I wound up watching HG while eating lunch till noon is when I went to the computer to send emails. I sent emails to people but not my ideal people.\n\nMorena whined earlier \"My house having a power outage.\" while Jolica wasn't too talkative with my previous emails' messages saying \"Seems like a nice day.\"\n\nUgh.\n\nI finally sent emails to my ideal people Morena and Jolica but in Jolica's email I said \"I alert you that I emailed you two Edenia series' stories for you to read when you have time.\"\n\nUgh nice. Too bad Morena doesn't have an email account for me to send her Edenia series stories for her to read because she whined to me \"Smash-words' website giving me trouble downloading your free stories.\"\n\nI had to tell her \"You to use Barnes and Noble's website.\"\n\nUgh hopefully that helped Morena to download my free stories. Ugh. Bah humbug to the fact that I'm stuck amusing myself at home out of unable to get outside walking around town or the driveway. The weather left ice all over the place including heavy snow too. Yucky weather!  \nAnyway mom by her phone call whined \"There's ice on the driveway giving me car trouble driving out.\"\n\nUgh poor Momsy Bobsy with her car. Oh well. Mom's car is nothing but a rusty junk bucket that beats eggs around the bushes and never seemed to be worth its job driving for mom. Yuck. Also I said jokes to mom by phone which I meant to use those jokes into a story and seeing what I can do involving those jokes I said.\n\nOne joke I said \"You getting a taxi and taxing around town like a taxi cab driver.\"\n\nOh well. Cute joke anyway. Ugh.\n\nAlso sometimes I say jokes \"You gulping peach pits and spitting them out onto the lawn and hope for a tree to grow.\"\n\nThis like one joke I said \"People gulping peach pits and spitting them out onto the stairs leading to a church of the High Council.\" involving something in the Edenia series.\n\nOh I think I said that as an insult than a joke something the High Council found out and scolded me in a visit to them they said \"You insulted us you to give your words of loyalty for that insult.\"\n\n\"I give my loyalty.\" I said with sarcasm which the speakers Shad and Onya said in response \"Meritanians transport Victoria out!\"\n\nI wound up transported to my apartment in Win's Ville as that town is called despite nicknamed Dead men's Village by the High Council.\n\nNothing happens in Win's Ville hence people insisted \"I want to be buried there.\"\n\nI'm not sure of why they want to be buried in Win's Ville despite the town is a college town for students to attend a small branch of the major college University of Long River Place. Oh sucks\n\nLast night was a fiasco around ten o'clock I wound up with an attack of voice scaring me \"Paranoid feeling are you forgetting something forgetting some?\" sang voice.\n\nYuck that bothered me too much to go number two in the toilet a lot.\n\nUgh I noticed the nerve for number two gets the voice involved with its chanting \"Are you forgetting something forgetting some?\"\n\nUgh which the voice has included \"Paranoid feeling!\" with its talk.\n\nNeighbor Jade Jeffery as that clone is called an older clone of someone I'm not sure of whom she is really.\n\nJade downstairs didn't like my toiletry's business ranged my doorbell around midnight with a note in hand \"Your toilet is too loud for me to sleep through so quit that noise. I'm getting up at five o'clock in the morning.\"\n\nUgh again I didn't say anything to her instead told her \"Sorry I'm sick.\"\n\n\"Dad you up and awake?\" I wound up whining to dad \"Sure I'm up and awake.\" I whined \"I'm suffering from an attack of voice.\" by texting message which he responded with a message telling me \"You to go watch TV and put up with the noises.\"\n\nUgh. I with the cat on my lap read and finished Michelle Michael's book which I finished. I rate that book five stars online Good Reads' website including ten stars onto my book lists I consider that book finished. Oh Yay for me.\n\nAlso I managed to read thirty pages of Verona Vander's seven's seven series book seven fold. Oh Yay for me like I said. I managed to read that book even with the cat on my lap entertaining her while watching crap. Ugh. The local news's crap started around three o'clock in the morning so I wound up watching that then I thought I would finish Michelle's book which I did. Oh goody for me for finishing that book which was rather good. Also I wound up showering around nine o'clock than me sick with a voiced attack around seven thirty or around eight o'clock like I habitually have done with the showering. I managed to shower warmly without the voice going off bothering me. Goody!\n\n\"Hi Mom its Victoria I'm up so text email me mews phone wise.\" I text emailed mom around nine o'clock for a phone call then showered and discovered mom text emailed me to call her \"Call Mom!\"\n\nI was on the phone for around an hour with the TV on blaring crummy shows out of charging my cell phone at the time. Ugh. Anyway after the phone call I was able to take a nap for around an hour till a little pass eleven o'clock is when I woke up. I did try multiple attempts to nap after that but I couldn't sleep much. Baby cute kitten hung around me in sight lying next to me in my armchair. I petted her cuteness including rubbing her furry belly but she tolerated that fine. I guess that my noisy head got too much for her to withstand that she's gone to hide somewhere and avoid me and my noises. Ugh. I swear I give up a scent or a noise in response to me having a noisy head such as me tired. Ugh hence cutie went to hide and avoid me slobbering her with kisses and hugs fests. Poor baby cute kitten.\n\nI wound up this morning emailing Morena I saying \"I'm whining of me sick all night with the bathroom number two. The toilet's noises were disturbing the downstairs' neighbor despite I sick.\"\n\nMorena said \"I rather suggested you go cold turkey with the dairy products as in quitting eating the food. You were seeing how your stomach feels involving the food and drink without eating or drinking dairy products.\"\n\nUgh again.\n\nAnyway Morena added \"You want to meet today at Mickayla's?\"\n\nI said \"Yes.\"\n\nThen at eleven o'clock she emailed me \"Sorry I have to cancel our lunch plans on how cold it got outside. I don't want you to get sick from the cold and frostbite.\"\n\nYucky anyway for this weather to be cold as ice and frostbite like. Yuck. I bagged up the cheese products including the dairy products intending to bring them to school but Maureen cancelled lunch at eleven o'clock.\n\n\"You want to meet another day?\" I asked Morena who said \"I agree for a brunch date at ten o'clock tomorrow Friday followed by me driving you home to pick up your dairy food from home. I will keep your dairy products' food and drink till your stomach problems quit.\"\n\nI'm hoping if my stomach proves that I'm allergic to dairy then I won't be eating and drinking that product stuff for the remainder of my life. Ugh sucks.\n\nMorena said \"My husband Jefferson Jones is allergic to dairy can't take in dairy products anymore hence I've got no dairy products at my home for my husband's sake. His body has gotten to the point that it can't stand dairy products into his stomach hence his problems in the toilet.\"\n\nThis sucks.\n\n\"Morena thinks I should stop dairy products food till my stomach problems of being up for hours sick quits to see if that's making me sick or something else.\" my text email to dad around five o'clock.\n\nDad sent me text email message involving what I whined about involving what Morena thinks with me and my eating food \"Stop drinking milk. Stop eating ice cream. Eat less cheese. And stop drinking that breakfast drink. Did you ever read what's in it? You get told but you won't change and you won't get an appointment at CWH to talk to your doctor about this problem. You prefer to do nothing because it's easier and you love sugar and high fructose corn syrup. Change your diet or stop complaining about it.\"\n\nHence today for breakfast I had chocolate spread which I'll have to quit eating including those chocolate milk soy drinks. I'll have to quit buying those chocolate milk soy drinks out of how expensive it is involving seventeen dollars for twelve bottles. Yuck. Anyway for lunch was just toast with butter onto it. I wound up meaning to eat four pieces of toast but since I'm trying to save food I'm eating just two pieces of toast instead. Oh well. Also I wound up for dinner having two sandwiches of toasted bread peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. The food was the only food I had left that wasn't dairies for me to eat. I figured I'll eat that including toasted buttered bread too. Nice. Plus I was sick in the toilet with a problem around the ten o'clock hour involving what I had for breakfast which sucks. I wound up eating something non dairy for lunch which brought on constipation hence I unable to have results in the toilet till two o'clock during the lunatic's talk show. Ugh. I've been watching the lunatic's talk show around the two o'clock hour after a talk show at one o'clock including before Dellen's show at three o'clock. I've been watching those three shows back to back followed by local news at four o'clock for the weather report. Oh Yay me. Mom wound up working a full afternoon work shift today hence she's not available for a phone call at six o'clock our regular time. Ugh mom's boss is terrible big time when the boss assigns odd hours for mom to work. Yuck anyway. I'm not so sure of when my monthly paycheck gets deposited either tomorrow the first of February or Monday the fourth of February. Ugh I'll have to pay attention to my bank account to see which day is that depositing done. Ugh. Usually when the third of the month falls on a Sunday I get my paycheck deposited on Friday the first. I'm hoping this keeps true to habit as I hoped. Ugh.\n\nThanks to my stupid stomach's troubles involving the toilet including me suffering from unable to sleep from the voice's talk because of me up for hours doing number two in the toilet I'm on a no dairy diet of foods. Ugh. I had last month one day a week for three weeks me sick in the toilet with number twos involving the voice getting involved for all hours of the night keeping me from sleeping. This sickness was the last straw involving my dairy intake eating hence I gave the food up to Morena to hold for me including either hold or use. Ugh.\n\nAnyway I went to the town library today where I returned Verona Vander's book \"seven banger times.\" I rate seven stars out of ten online. Nice I guess.\n\nAlso I dropped off a magazine on gymnastics I finished which I didn't read the articles back to back instead only read what I cared in that magazine then donated the thing to the town library. That was nice of me. I picked up four books one I'm unfinished with reading I hope to get around to finishing that book when I do. Ugh. Also went to drug store where I paid eleven dollars and ninety cents for two pills for my deductible payment plans. Ugh to pay anyway. I used to get the prescriptions for free but now they cost me money I have to pay. Yuck. After drug store I went grocery shopping where I tried to avoid buying dairy products including sugary foods too. I wound up just buying healthy foods I could figure out was healthy including some drinks that was on sale I figured I'll drink them at school in front of Morena to examine. After grocery shopping I went home where I didn't do much besides send people emails out of needing something to do. Ugh.\n\nAlso I slept fine from ten o'clock to around eight o'clock but my lack of sugary foods such as chocolate spread ruined my pills' wake up status at nine o'clock. I was falling asleep when ten thirty rolled around. I had to nap quite a lot as a result of that sleepiness.\n\nI'm not sure if that sleepiness was a result of me sick in the toilet earlier this week. Ugh noticed a pattern involving me sick in the toilet up for hours on Monday nights to Tuesday mornings for three weeks. This is a yucky problem to have. Yuck. I checked out four books today from town library totaling my checking out books to five books I have now at home waiting for me to read.\n\nTwo of the books were Anna Alina's Bloody Diaries' series books two and three. The books always end in cliffhangers something I just have to check out involving books two and three. Ugh. Book two is an unfinished book I meant to get around to finishing it once I consult my list of where I ended that book. I aimed to finish that damn book then read book three followed by the withdrawn copies of books four and five I have on that series at home in my bookcase. I can't wait to read those books oh well. I also checked out Terrific Terri's Terrible Two's series I thought I would finish that series. I already read the earlier books of that series when they came out but I never finished that series. Ugh don't get it at all why I couldn't finish that series when Terrible Two's first came out. Ugh again. I found a book by Kelly Keller which I saw at the library's desk called \"Slayer.\" some Anna Alina's Bloody Diaries' vampire slayer knockoff book that caught my eye enough to check the book out.\n\n\"I want to check that book out.\" I asked librarian.\n\nThe librarian said \"You have to wait awhile before you could check that book out. Others asked for it so I'll put you onto the list.\"\n\nUgh. Also I have at home a prequel themed script book involving a prequel movie for the book. I meant to get around to reading that prequel to the seven series' script book. Oh screw it to my mood for not bothering to read that library book. Ugh. Since I've gotten those library books into my home I have yet to crack them open or finish one of the three books I'm in process of reading. Ugh this sucks.\n\nAlso one of the three books I'm reading is called \"Moon Dreams\" by Janna Japan that was reviewed with one stars online Bay's Books' website.\n\nUgh I'm trying to get into the mood to finish that damn book despite being partially way through Japan's book despite put off with the spelling and languages' uses.\n\n\"Moon Dreams\" is providing to be a terrible book involving the languages' uses into it involving characters' talks \"Ye old privy\" is an example for bathroom.\n\n\"Ye old privy\" is still used for bathroom in that story including talks on that subject.\n\nI hate the languages' uses involving the bathroom including the subject. I preferred the language to be cleaned up and told in proper English terms than slang terms making me guess what's said. Ugh this is annoying me too much enough to want to give up that damn book. Yuck. I'm also reading Anna Alina's book \"Prince Bloody\" after viewing the movie version to \"Prince Bloody\" on TV.\n\nI wound up reading the first three books of the series Prince the Bloody till I got to \"Prince Bloody's\" book in the series.\n\nI think I should have focused onto \"Prince Bloody\" than any of the books of the series because the series is getting boring for me.\n\n\"What do you think of Anna Alina's series Prince the Bloody?\" I asked her.\n\n\"I won't read more of that series.\" according to her on the phone \"I already read the first book of the series. I won't read more of the other books after finding the first book religious like involving a back from the dead theme.\"\n\nUgh mom added \"I hate books involving religion themed back from the dead themes. I find them inappropriate to read and won't read them period.\"\n\nI told mom \"I'm reading Anna Alina's book Thievery the latest book in her Bloody Diaries' series. I'm trying to get motivated to read the e-book version despite wanting the paper version to read.\"\n\nMom spoke \"I hate e-books I prefer paper books instead.\"\n\n\"Ugh I haven't been in the mood for e-books by e-reader lately. I'm not so sure of why I can't stand reading by e-reader despite e-books is somewhat popular for people to read.\" I said which I added \"Oh well. I don't get it my attitude for e-books by e-reader.\"\n\nMom said \"Then don't read by e-reader but focused onto paper books.\"\n\nI blame mom for this damned attitude towards e-books because she's old fashioned and been more interested into paper books than reading anything electronically. Oh I swear mom's attitude towards electronic books is rubbing off onto me. Oh well.\n\nLast night I got onto the phone multiple times trying to reach mom till like ten after nine o'clock is when I finally reached mom.\n\n\"Hello please leaves a message after the beep!\" her answering machine said in a male voice which I said \"Mom its Victoria pickup the phone I'm calling you! Kindly text emails me mews ASAP!\"\n\n\"Its Victoria kindly text email me mews ASAP.\" I sent to her cell phone.\n\nMom ignored me and my pleas for a phone call till nine o'clock is when her text emailed me saying \"Call mom!\"\n\nI was on the phone for an hour till like ten of ten o'clock is when we signed off \"Good night Momsy!\"\n\n\"Good night Victoria!\" said mom.\n\nUgh. I wound up sick in the toilet with diarrhea like problems three times last night. I don't know if something I'm eating is making me sick or something I'm withdrawing is making me sick with the toilet. Yuck.\n\nI took Morena's suggestion \"You should not be flushing the toilet after ten o'clock in the evening.\"\n\nI did flush last night ending around nine o'clock when I woke up around five o'clock to pee I didn't flush but I did flush around seven o'clock when I woke up and started my damn day. I had a weird dream involving people becoming superheroes after eating certain foods like some lemony like substance that gave them the ability to morph into invincible people that was bullet proof from guns including a height and body appearance change. I saw in that weird dream was the Hamden house including my room and the kitchen. I also dreamed of Tiger the girl cat hanging around in that dream. Ugh I don't get it the dream except assumed this was a memory of my life at that house. Ugh don't know. Also the anniversary of Tiger's passing is coming up this month which it'll be two years since she entered eternal rest sleep. Ugh a pity to dad who's not recovered from that yet. Ugh he's keeping one girl cat Willow alive too long instead of putting her down asleep. Willow's suffering from bathroom sicknesses including a very thin form of not eating much food enough to be skeletal. Ugh Dad keeping Willow alive is annoying when he should put her down asleep the moment she turned out to be sick with her sicknesses. Ugh damn dad. I worry that one of those days I'll show up to dad's house when dad isn't home and find Willow dead on the kitchen floor a victim of a cat fight by one of the cats putting her down into eternal rest. Ugh I have nightmares of that situation. Yuck. Also I worry that I'll take Walnut dad's girl cat from his house and haul her to my apartment soon after Willow is found dead on the kitchen floor. I'm not sure if that'll be good for Walnut or good for Samantha. Ugh. Samantha isn't welcoming towards other cats and animals hence she's more solitary cat and more a one person furry baby cute kitten like she is towards me. Cutie tolerates my hugs and kisses galore like that's her paycheck for free eat around here. This is a pity. I woke up around seven o'clock this morning and didn't do much except waited till eight thirty to shower and ring mom up by phone.\n\nMom text emailed me \"Call Mom!\" as she wound up texting me around nine o'clock.\n\nI was on the phone with mom saying \"I'm debating on when to go to church.\"\n\nUgh.\n\n\"I'm debating on whether to go in the morning or in the evening.\" She said which I said \"I give no feedback in that matter because I hate attending church.\"\n\nI don't particularly care for attending church masses every once a week for a religion that dictates this crummy status.\n\nYuck mom said \"You should go. Church is good for you and your soul.\"\n\nUgh mom made up her mind \"I'll go in the morning.\"\n\nWe both hung up the phone then I went to the computer.\n\nI sent whining emails to Morena \"I'm whining of mom's insisting I go to church when I don't care for church's religious beliefs.\" I said in one email then I said in another email \"I hate church and don't care for religion and won't go no matter how people like mom insisted I go to church.\"\n\n\"That's alright for you.\" Morena responded but didn't stick around for a talk or for my reply of a cat saying \"EEE!\" including thumbs up symbol. She sucks big time when's she's not around for a talk much.\n\nI was itching to talk to someone today like Morena \"I want to talk to you.\" but she wasn't available by not responding.\n\nUgh. I don't know what's going on with Morena not being around for a chat like I hoped she would be. Ugh I love chatting with Morena but I hate it when's she isn't available like I hoped she would be like today. Ugh again.\n\nI crashed around ten thirty last night but I didn't flush the toilet till morning around nine o'clock is when I woke up and started my damn day. Ugh.\n\n\"Hi Mom what's mew with you?\" I ranged mom up by phone around nine o'clock but mom picked up to whine \"I'm not being ready for a phone call. I'm doing laundry and eating breakfast hence I insisted on another phone call at nine forty five.\"\n\nUgh I showered and ate breakfast then charged cell phone twice followed by charging e-reader too. I also phoned mom and was on the phone for forty five minutes till ten thirty is when we got off the phone. Ugh.\n\nI did tell mom \"I'm having a lunch date with Morena today.\"\n\nMom said \"Good tell me about that once I'm home from work.\"\n\nMorena emailed me \"Sorry I have to cancelled our lunch date.\" when she emailed me around eleven o'clock.\n\nToday was nice and mild out enough to have the window open including nice to get outside walking around for garbage tossing out including wearing a nice sweater jacket. Ugh I was hoping to walk to school for lunch with Morena to enjoy the nice day but she said \"Sorry I have to cancel out on meetings with teachers union.\"\n\nI'm not happy about staying home slobbering the poor baby cute kitten who seemed to say \"I wishes you out of my sight and away from me.\"\n\nShe tolerated my hugs but tried to bite my nose when I kept on giving her kisses hence I know she wants me out of the apartment and away from her cuteness. Poor baby cute kitten aw. I put on khaki pants that fit me fine but a sweater I put with that was a bit see through hence I had to wear a bra. I think I'll get rid of that damn sweater out of the see through status of that thing. I hate clothes that require me to wear a damn bra. Yuck. Since Morena cancelled our lunch I've been wearing raggedy sweats as a result of not having to wear a nice pair of pants including a nice sweater. Ugh Morena for canceling our lunch when I wanted to get outside today and walk. Ugh. I'm depressed today enough to spend more money off junk online somewhere. I just don't want to do that money spending after buying six e-books for fifty four dollars or around the amount of fifty five dollars. Ugh.\n\nI told mom by phone last night \"I spend fifty five dollars onto e-books.\"\n\nMom threw an angry fit \"I'm finding that spending not proper! You could have used that money for paying off debt to dad!\"\n\nUgh thanks a lot mom for that attitude. Ugh. Also annoying is I'm fed up with paying dad that debt money I owe him. I'm fed up with mom throwing angry fits to me buying expensive things like e-books and Columbia girl dolls. Mom sucks and so does dad. Ugh both suck big time. I'm just annoyed with this damned debt I owe dad to pay him back money wise. I'm so fed up with paying dad this debt money I owe him.\n\nI'm just tempt to tell mom by phone \"The debt is already paid now.\" or maybe I'll do that a few days later just to get her off my back \"You shouldn't be spending money on stuff.\"\n\nI was on the phone with mom twice last night \"Mom pickup the phone!\"\n\nI called her at seven o'clock but she ignored me so I ranged her up at eight o'clock and reached her.\n\nMom picked up to whine \"I'm working overtime. I just got into my apartment. I wanted you to call me back at nine o'clock in an hour's time frame.\"\n\nUgh.\n\nI ranged mom at nine o'clock which she after thirty minutes of talk \"I wanted to end the phone call.\" which I gave her \"Goodbye mom!\"\n\nMom was instead of hanging up \"I'm into a rant involving the damn dumpster and how germy that was.\"\n\nUgh jeez mom.\n\nWell I finally hung up our call around nine forty on moms whining \"I want to hang up!\"\n\nThe operator typed the stop keying symbol and I hung up \"GA to SK.\"\n\nI didn't bother to watch the remains of a TV show instead I journal by journal till ten o'clock when I crashed into bed. Ugh again. Also slept till six thirty woken up with bathroom which I flushed this time despite unsure of when the neighbor gets up despite sure she gets up at five o'clock in the morning. Ugh I took a nap for an hour sleeping till seven thirty is when I got up and started my damn day by checking stuff onto the computer. Ugh oh well. Baby cute kitten's gone to the couch to snooze which she tummy sitting this morning when I entered the living room. I guess she's being cute as a munchkin enough to be slobbered with kisses and given hugs fests. Aw cute. I snatched cutie for a hug that tolerated that fine then got out of my arms to sit onto the couch. Aw cute. I love that little munchkin bunches to slobber her with kisses and hugs fests. She's so tolerant of her paycheck for free eat around here. Aw cute.\n\n\"Dad you free for driving me around for errands? Please and Thanks!\"\n\nDad has been whining \"I doing you favors without any thanks and pleases.\"\n\nI saying \"Please and thanks!\" which dad said \"I agree with a time of one o'clock.\"\n\nDad by texting whined \"One day a week for driving you around is what I insisted on.\"\n\nI asked him \"what about Saturdays for our errands' outing?\" which he never text emailed me a response. \"Jerk!\" I felt like texting in response to his silence.\n\nMom by phone this morning said \"I'm not coming up today by my car having a problem from driving over a branch I'm sticking close to home.\"\n\nUgh poor Momsy. Aw. Anyway dad arrived five minutes early which he drove me to the town library where I dropped off two finished library books.\n\nOne book is a script book to the movie Prince Bloody featuring Bristol Berlin in that movie nice. I rate that book ten stars in my book lists for amusing me to read it entirely Thursday night for two hours. Also dropped off Anna Alina's Bloody Diaries' series I rate seven stars out of ten. I figured why not finding the book good but the vulgarity I found into the book was inappropriate. Also I finished that book during one morning of me sick with a voiced attack from the bathroom. Ugh.\n\n\"Thursday night into Friday morning I was sick with a voiced attack including multiple cases of bathroom.\" something I whined to mom by phone in the morning \"I don't know what's going on with my stomach.\"\n\nMom said \"I think this case is something else beside you withdrawing from dairy products. I insisted you go seek a physical doctor on this case.\"\n\nI said \"I have an appointment on Thursday.\"\n\nI during my voiced attack avoided using the flush part of the toilet. I only put the tissues into a plastic bag and threw that out in the morning.\n\nUgh I was trying to be accommodating to the downstairs' neighbor whining of my toilet going off \"Your toilet is too noisy for me to withstand tolerant.\"\n\nUgh. I picked up a world war two book I think I should have checked out but I didn't bother despite impressed with the cover of the color red. Oh well. I noticed books with the color red have been attracting my eye enough to check them out from the library.\n\nAlso I picked up some books by Terrific Terri involving the Dollar Shot's small books that are supposedly be fast reading. This is my second time I've checked out those Dollar Shot books and haven't read them the first time I checked them out. I'm determined to read them since I checked them out again. I also picked up a romance novel told by a guy that's seemed interesting but I doubt I would read that damn book. Oh well. That book was an impulsive checkout. Ugh. After library I went to drug store intending to buy a notebook but the line for cashier was too long and made me avoid buying anything as a result. I had no patience to wait for me to buy my notebook I wanted. Ugh hence I gave up and left the store. Dad went into the store for something involving medication but didn't stick around waiting for me instead he went to the car. Ugh I saw him do that rude behavior. After I went grocery shopping which I bought some chocolate milk and something involving reduced bakery cookie cake I thought I would eat it once home. I was craving chocolate hence I bought the drink including craving cookies hence I bought the cookie cake. Ugh I ate the cookie cake at home but not the drink. I once I was home chased the baby cat around intending to slobber her with hugs and kisses but she balked and ran off. Oh well dumb me for that slobbering the kitty behavior that the kitten wasn't in the mood and ran elsewhere. Oh well again. I received my journal today which is good I guess. I have to leave feedback for the seller online their website for selling me that journal. Oh Yay me I guess for getting that journal in the mail today. Ooh goody. Also cute baby kitten wound up onto the couch snoozing that was the reception of kisses onto the top of her cute furry head. She tolerated the kisses fine like the kiss was her paycheck for free eats around here. Poor baby cute kitten. Aw.\n\n\"Thanks from a Fantastic Fan!\" I said as my feedback comment to the seller for selling me that journal Fantastic Fans.\n\nI do hope they bother to leave feedback involving me leaving them feedback.\n\n\"Great to deal with you again!\" they said in response.\n\nI ordered stuff from Bay's Books before and leave high fives feedback but the seller sometimes didn't bother to leave me feedback which annoyed me. This lack of feedback hurt my feelings and made me think they just wanted my money and not thanking me for buying their item. Ugh last time I'm buying something from them for not leaving me feedback for me. Ugh. Also I wound up buying bananas two of them for dinner which I had. I was still itching to eat so off I went nuking up some French fries and ate that too. I think I ate way too much for dinner because I'm stuffed into my stomach. Ugh at least I ate food anyway. I'm like halfway through a notebook for journaling which I meant to go buy another one today but the line to the cashier was too long and I saw dad leave the store and not wait for me. I gave up buying that notebook as a result of long line and dad's rudeness. Ugh sucks. I'll have to wait till later to buy another notebook or maybe from the school's store to journal into. This'll be fun for me to journal when I get around to it from buying notebooks and writing rants and stuff into them. Ugh nice I guess. I use those written word journals to write stuff into them then once I'm done with a notebook I toss it out into the dumpster like symbolizing throwing out problems that bother me. I feel much better after I toss out a journal. Oh Yay for me. I worry with the noises in my head connected to the nerve for number two that I'll wound up with an attack of voice one night and have just peeing in the toilet than anything number two. I had a case of that once which I'm hoping I won't have another case of that again. Ugh. I've had cases of my paranoia aggravated in response to me having sicknesses in the toilet including me sick with voice too. Yuck. I don't care for the nerve to number two to get the voice involved making it hard to do anything like sleeping or resting or anything shitty crummy like that status. Ugh again.\n\nDad came over with papers for me to sign which he had me fill out in the car than in my apartment's home. Poor baby cute kitten hid as a result and hasn't come out of hiding since that damned visit of me in dad's car. Dumb cat dumb animal. Ugh. Also I ordered two journals involving the Fantastic Fans' series. Oh Yay me except the bill was around twenty six dollars. I doubt that mom would like that fact that I spent money when I owe dad money for the cat's vet bill. Ugh a pity anyway.\n\nMom would throw a hissing angry fit in response \"You spending money onto stuff than paying dad back that vet bill!\"\n\n\"Ugh a pity!\" I said.\n\nBaby cute kitten must be hiding in response to me slobbering her head and face with lots of kisses earlier. I guess that the munchkin got fed up with the kisses I was giving her and went to hide somewhere to sleep without me disturbing her cuteness. Poor baby cute kitten aw. I love that little kitty cat galore. I love to slobber kisses onto the baby cat's head and snout. I love to pick her up for hugs and kisses onto her nose. I love it when the baby cat's tolerant of my kisses and hugging moods. I love that little stinker bunches. Cutie came out of hiding and got snatched up for a hugging cuddle. She tolerated the cuddle fine by licking my nose then demanded to be put down which I agreed. Poor baby cute kitten for always picked up for hugs and kisses every where around here. Aw. I love my little munchkin bunches to pick her up for hugs and kisses. I love it when's the baby bundle of fur is so tolerant to my hugging and kissing moods. I love that little kitten mitten galore. She's so cute. Ooh I'm dying to order a new edition of Verona Vander's seven series' books with a different cover on it. I'm not sure of where I should order the books from. Ugh Bay's Books has them for fifty dollars while Barnes and Noble's website has them for sixty five dollars. Ugh not entirely sure which is better quality Bay's Books or Barnes and Noble. Ugh sucks decisions. I think my college days of reading multiple books are ingrained within me because I'm still reading multiple books in progress. The multiple books are a habit I had since college that I'm still taking in present day. Ugh. Also I started book three of the Prince Bloody's series by Anna Alina last night reading like thirty pages of that book. I found that book was rather vulgar with vulgarity languages' uses including terms for insults and sexual innuendo. Ugh no wonder I gave up that series after reading the first two books of Prince Bloody. Ugh I meant to finish that series or just read and finish book three. I meant to go skim the ending of the third book to see how the murder mystery turns out including how the vampires managed to get a soul saved. Ugh again. I'm just finding Prince Bloody's series rather vile and vulgar with the languages and the intended subject too. Hence I don't care too much for the book. Yuck. I might as well consider skimming Prince Bloody then get rest of the books of the series to skim. Ugh. After I skim that book Prince Bloody I aimed to read more of the other books if I'm inclined but I'll be skimming them. I don't think I can tolerate the vile vulgarity into that series. Yuck.\n\n\"Are you forgetting something forgetting some paranoid feeling?!\" sang voice\n\nI was wrong with the attack of voice happening later this week. The attack of voice is happening tonight enough to bother me. I wound up attacked by voice all night into this morning. Yuck. This sucks big time anyway when's I'm to shower soon enough but I'm not sure if I can shower even with the inner noises' blaring. Yuck. Ooh I'm to shower soon enough I can't wait to shower today and avoid the inner noises' blaring bothering me. Yuck. Something I thought of involving the seven series Verona Vander which seemed like fan fiction to me. I cleaned the toilet giving that dirty thing a good scrubbing then I cleaned the dirty spots in the tub but not a whole scrubbing. Ugh I cleaned the sink in the bathroom but not a good job or a whole scrubbing. Oh well. Also I cleaned out Sam's bathroom as in replacing the kitty litter with fresh kitty litter then I did garbage tossing out twice. I tossed out a bag full of tissues I used for when I was sick in the toilet one night. Ugh also tossed out the old kitty litter with the jug and some old food containers too. Oh Yay me. After cleaning I opened a window and am taking advantage of the nice mildness today to have the window open for awhile. Oh nice that today is nice enough to have the window open. Ooh goody I guess. Oh around ten o'clock when local news interrupted their talk show with donkey turnip's address I wound up going to HG channel then craved more chocolate. I went to win's Deli for a sandwich and some food. Everything cost me twenty five dollars and some change including an extra plastic bag full of food to carry than my cloth bag. Ugh. I wound up once I was home piglet onto the food including having cutesy cat hanging around demanding her share. I won't feed the baby cat human food despite she hangs around me begging for some. Dumbbell cat is so stupid when it's comes to human food. Ugh dumb animal dumb cat. Oh well. Speaking of the dumbbell cat she's gone to the couch to snooze cutely and being cute little munchkin when's slobbered with kisses and given hugs fests. She's so cutely tolerant to the hugs and kisses I slobber that furry bundle of fur with. I love that little mouse house galore even whenever she gives off stinky farts. Poor baby cute kitten for always let it rip with those stinky farts of hers. I think she's copying me letting it rip in front of her hence she's letting it rip in my presence including onto my lap. Ugh.\n\nToday's a holiday that's bound to bore me to tears actually. Ugh a story involving the group called High Council's boredom. Pele is a soccer player a human male breaks leg scoring winning goal for team in a playoff college match he learns \"Your team has lost the next match without you there.\"\n\nHe makes deal with the High Council to continue playing after healing from leg injury for his junior and senior years in college.\n\n\"You will serve us with undivided loyalties!\" says High Council.\n\nSoccer player Pele as named said \"I'll serve you once you assure me of healing my leg to play soccer for my junior and senior years' of college including major league playing.\"  \n\"You have our agreement.\" As said by Shad and Onya the speakers of the High Council who added \"Any bus knock him out now.\"\n\nPele gets knocked out unconscious put into a tube and cloned despite Meritanians ordered \"You're to sicken Pele with memories of his clone's playing while he's unconscious.\"\n\nThis is done which healing involves being cloned with the cloned copy having better leg taking human's place. Original human is contained into tube of Hall of Voices at first doesn't realize he's cloned till later. Clone given original memories of playing soccer.\n\nOriginal by thinking \"I'm realizes I'm cloned and trapped into tube status to my disgust.\"\n\nHigh Council play games of chess with soccer players mostly males out of boredom.\n\nI crashed around ten thirty last night which I woke up around two o'clock in the morning with my head singing \"Are you forgetting something?\"\n\nThe noises of my head were keeping me from sleeping properly hence I had to remove some blankets. I slept without my blankets as a result and cut that inner noises' blaring. Also cutesy cat came and visited me but she didn't stick around for a tummy sits onto my chest instead ran off even after I caught her cuteness. Dumb cat dumb animal. Ugh.\n\nI woke up around three thirty with again noises in my head I wound up laying there for awhile \"Are you forgetting something?\"\n\nMerra's voice said \"I suggested you get up and read a library book.\"\n\nI didn't bother and wound up resuming sleeping till seven o'clock is when I woke up by daylight and got up. Ugh. I didn't flush the toilet till ten minutes to eight o'clock is when I did that flushing out of respects to the downstairs' neighbor whining of my noisy toilet. Ugh hence I gave up flushing after ten o'clock in the evening. I just put the toilet tissues into the garbage and hope for the best. Ugh. Also last night I eyed one bookcase full of books and thought the hard covers should be on the bottom shelf than on the first shelf. This bottom shelf thought meant my bookcase was top heavy and would tip over hence I moved books around last night for five minutes. Ugh sucks. I showered around eight thirty regular times frame of showering then mom text emailed me.\n\n\"Call Mom!\" she text emailed me.\n\nI wasn't sure if she would come see me today or not despite today's her day off from work. Ugh hence I took my pills fifteen minutes early and ate chips while on the phone with mom.\n\nMom said \"I assured you of coming up.\" which around nine o'clock \"Love you lots.\"\n\nI wound up taking a well deserved nap till like ten thirty woken up by my noisy head chanting \"Are you forgetting something?\"\n\nUgh hence I got up and wound up nose into an e-book instead of the library's version of that book.\n\nVoice has been picky like Morena \"You having checked out library's books you already own the e-book version of you should forget checking out just read the e-book version.\"\n\nThis is something I'm slow to listen or obey. Ugh.\n\nI wound up reading an e-book by Anna Alina book ten of her Bloody Fever series focused onto one character grown up into an adult female. Anna Alina's series involving vampires' book is rather interesting book so far from what've read and determined to finish. Mom arrived around eleven o'clock something or maybe around eleven thirty I didn't pay attention to the time. Oh well was nose into an e-book while charging e-reader as a result of waiting for mom despite a noisy head. Ugh.\n\n\"Here kitty. Where's she gone?\" Mom tried to get Sam to come out of hiding for petting but the kitty hid while mom was in the apartment.\n\nPoor kitty seemed to have forgotten mom. Oh well.\n\n\"I want to go to the town library.\" Mom said \"I agree to your talk and will drive you.\"\n\nMom and I went to town library where mom said \"I'm staying in the car while you went into the library to drop off books.\"\n\nI picked up two books one involving Anna Alina's involving her Bloody Diaries series called Bloody Fever. I picked up a book by Terrific Terri who's a good author with a book's cover that attracted my eye enough to check out that book. Oh well. Mom and I went to Bi's pizza where I tried tomato salad and pepperoni which tasted okay but rather plain to me and didn't seem interesting anyway worthy of trying again. Oh well I did eat bacon on top of my cheese pizza which tasted okay and rather interesting than plain cheese. Nice after pizza was for pills which I picked up Prozac for eight dollars and fifty cents a part of my payment plan. I used my own dollar money to pay for the pills than card. Ugh.\n\n\"I want to go to Barnes and Noble.\" Mom said \"No I don't feel like driving that lengthy to there.\"\n\nI went grocery shopping after because mom said no to going to Barnes and Noble's bookstore \"I want groceries.\" I said in response which Mom said \"I agree with you.\"\n\nAfter groceries was home where we piglet onto some candy Reese's peanut butter cup in egg shape and some cake brownies from \"Small Wonder.\"\n\nMom tried to get Sam to come out of hiding for petting but Sam didn't bother and remained in hiding \"Here kitty, come out and be petted!\"\n\nMom left for home in disgust \"I'm disgusted with your cat not around for petting.\"\n\nI said in response \"Sorry Momsy Bobs.\"\n\nI emailed Jolica which I said \"Today mom came over for a short outing of library to drop off finished library books including one I don't think I can finish out of losing interests.\n\nI picked up two library books and checked them out. One of the books' so far is rather interesting. I went to lunch at Bi's pizza where I tried bacon topping onto cheese tasted ok even though first time I ate them both together. After that was groceries then home kiss faced the cat which mom dropped me off.\"\n\nJolica read my email right away like she was online and responded with her message regarding bacon on pizza \"I preferred pepperoni on pizza instead.\"\n\nOh nice. After emailing Jolica I emailed Tom a copy and paste of my message to Jolica's to Tom's Chat email option. He wasn't online reading that email. He hasn't been online in six hours according to Chat's email. Ugh sucks. Also sent Morena a lengthy paragraphed email that hasn't yet bothered to read that email or responded. Ugh sometimes Morena sucks with her lack of communication involving Chat's email which sometimes annoys me. Ugh again.\n\n\"Yesterday I went to read and finish Bloody Diaries' book Prince Bloody a library book. I read a bit of yesterday. Also I started last night Prince Bloody which I read around fifty pages. I'm just not sure of when to start reading again. Oh well.\"\n\nMy email copied and pasted to people Jolica responded right away with \"Happy reading.\"\n\nI'm waiting for responses from Morena and Jolica.\n\nI emailed to Jolica \"What are you reading book wise?\"\n\n\"Morena won't respond and she'll ignore you.\" says voice which I heard Merra laughing into my mind like she told a joke again.\n\nOh well again but I'm sure that my cousin newly discovered cousin who's seemed to be a leech involving dad's billionaire status dubbed Christina Christian as she calls herself. Christina Christian emailed me out of the blue \"Hi Victoria it's your cousin Christina Christian cousin of your brother's wife Tamara Mykola emailing you.\"\n\nI didn't know what to say to her in response except my email involving reading Prince Bloody.\n\n\"She will respond\" said voice which Merra said blaring \"You know this Christina Christian is trying to leech money from you out of Horus\" name of Jinks Montreal my assumed father \"Is richly known with money well off. Just don't tell her much of monetary issues but bore her with books. She'll lose interests and start to leech off someone else.\"\n\nI obeyed to do that babbling about books which she has yet to respond. Anyway baby cute kitten has gone to the couch to snooze and be a cute little kitten mitten. I love that little mouse house even whenever she stinks up the cat's bathroom. She's my stinky little kitty. Aw cute I guess.\n\nMom text emailed me at eight thirty in the morning saying \"Have a good day. Call me tonight at seven love you mom.\"\n\nMom's working a work shift from ten o'clock to four thirty this afternoon. Nice I guess. Oh mom did claim by phone \"I'm working overtime to five o'clock if the store is busy from people panicking of the winter storm hitting later today.\"\n\nOh well hate those storms. They cause a panic in the grocery store and gives mom extra overtime work. Ugh Mom loves her job but she's always tired from not able to get enough rest. This is a pity towards mom for always being tired as a tire iron that should be retired. Ugh.\n\nI woke up early as fifteen minutes before seven o'clock. Ugh also I woke up and figured I'll stay up so I did that wakeup.\n\n\"Hi Morena what's mew with you meow?\" I emailed her catching her online she saying \"Howdy Victoria!\"\n\nAnyway I emailed Morena by Chat's email which we were in a chat for thirty minutes from seven thirty to eight o'clock is when she quit chat \"I have to go do errands before work. I'm getting a pair of sports' glasses for me to see when doing archery.\"\n\nNice I started my damn day with rituals involving showering including eating breakfast after I got dressed. Ugh I exchanged my clothes multiple times till I settled onto Georgia labeled clothes of red which I wore while out today. Ugh again.\n\n\"Hi Morena what's mew with you?\" I emailed Morena again who responded but kept chat short as a minute \"I'm working so sorry I can't talk long.\"\n\nUgh I hated that I wanted to talk to Maureen but she wasn't talkative. Ugh terrible big time. I walked to Mickayla's intended to arrive there early as slow as I could till halfway there I realized that pharmacy called my landline last night and left a message.\n\nI figured I would waste time walking to pharmacy \"I'm asking why the pharmacy called my landline?\"\n\nUgh I walked to the pharmacy which turned out to be a pill refill of Geodon pill for again eight dollars and fifty cents. I hate my new health insurance plan involving me paying for pills for a deductible payment plan. Yuck. After pills I walked to Mickayla's for sitting around waiting for Morena to arrive. Morena was late as five minutes and arrived after texting me a message by cell phone.\n\n\"I am on my way.\" She said by cell phone text email.\n\nUgh I didn't save that message instead delete it once she arrived. Morena and I settled onto hot dogs and French fries but seltzer water for her and me pink lemonade drink in a plastic bottle for me. We intended to share the French fries but the waitress or cook got our order wrong by giving our plates individual French fries. Ugh terrible big time when that had to happen.\n\nAnyway Morena wound up saying \"I'm insisting that you stay in the school library as I worked till three o'clock. I noticed you were not happy about that news. You look sad.\" She said when she told me of me staying till three o'clock instead of driving me home right away.\n\nI didn't tell Morena \"My mood was deflated by you insisting I stay at the school till three o'clock instead of going home right away.\"\n\nUgh. Morena went back to work which I went to the school's library and fooled around by computer including visiting the bathroom that smelled of someone smoked into there. This was a yucky smell despite smelling of marijuana yuck anyway. I suspect one of the students using the computer smoked into the bathroom and then resumed their work onto the computer. Ugh yuck.\n\nI managed to buy a book for twenty five cents by this singer named Jewel called \"Dawn's Light.\"\n\nI liked that singer enough to buy her book I saw was selling at the bookcase for books the school library was selling. Nice. After that I coughed up forty cents for printing four pieces of paper from word for printing one story I had in an email to dad. That story is fan fiction to Alina's story I thought I would print it out and have mom read it whenever she's here in my home from Australia I nickname her southern area of the state where she lives.\n\nMorena arrived around three o'clock but she didn't take me to the car right away instead she went to talk to the librarian on some paperwork then scolded me \"You shouldn't shout!\" when I verbalized \"I need help how to log off the computer. I don't know how to log off.\"\n\nUgh Merra was laughing into my mind at the time hence I had to use the librarian's help. After library Morena and I went to her car where she drove me home which I picked up two half full bags of books I was donating. I wound up donating the seven series in paperback including some rejected library books that the town library was giving up for free I didn't feel like reading. Ugh. Oh I ordered some used books off Bay's Books which should be arriving soon enough. I noticed the ordering of items is easy to do but the delivering of things kills me and drives me crazy with impatience. Ugh hence I shouldn't be ordering stuff. Ugh I'm bored to tears with the damn TV including not having someone to talk to.\n\n\"I want to talk to you.\" liked to have Morena available to talk to but she's not onto her computer today.\n\nUgh this lack of someone to talk to sucks big time. Also I threw out the garbage then after that opened a window and aired out the dust into here I stirred up dusting some things on the computer and TV's equipment. Ugh about time I dusted both the equipment of the computer and TV. I organized my Columbia girl dolls. Last night I took out Matilda May doll to put onto a bookcase out of wanting a doll to display.\n\nVoice scolded me \"You shouldn't be displaying Matilda May doll which should be boxed in the closet.\"\n\nThat talk was said despite the doll was in good condition when I put her onto the bookcase for display.\n\nVoice bothered me just prior to me going to bed said \"I insisted on Matilda and Malina dolls being boxed into the closet.\"\n\nVoice also mentioned \"You should be boxing Malina doll too.\"\n\nBoth Matilda and Malina doll were in good condition which voice insisted \"You should box them both for preserving them.\"\n\nI ignored the voice's order and went to bed sleeping till daylight was sensed around seven o'clock is when I woke up.\n\nSometimes when I'm trying to sleep in the morning the voice blares \"Get up!\"\n\nSometimes the voice acts like an inner alarm clock annoying me enough to either ignore or by compulsion I get up and start my damn day. Yuck to have that inner problem.\n\nAlso this morning I woke up and wound up doing what voice ordered me boxing Matilda and Malina's dolls into the closet. I had Kelly Keller doll on display but I didn't care for that damned doll so I boxed her with Matilda and Malina doll.\n\nI wound up taking out both dolls and thought \"I would display Matilda and Malina doll.\"\n\nI don't care for Kelly Keller dolls or that their worse condition than Matilda or Malina doll. I haven't displayed Matilda doll in awhile so I put her out onto a bookcase into my bedroom. I put out onto a bookcase in my hallway to the bathroom a terrible condition doll in older dress and hair braided. I figured I'll put that doll there so I can avoid worrying about knocking her off the bookcase if it's by accident or on purpose. Ugh. I originally put Matilda doll in hallway's bookcase but I kept bumping into that doll when walking to and from the bathroom. I replaced her with a doll just to avoid worrying about knocking that doll accidentally onto the floor or having doll being sliding off the bookcase. I received my books yesterday in the mail. Oh Yay except didn't get my utilities and cable bills. Ugh I was hoping on paying for both bills as quickly as I could then go buy frivolous stuff like e-books of books I liked enough to get them.\n\nI've got some books in the mail I already have copies of I thought \"I'll take those two books with me to the trip to New York City.\"\n\nTrip is in April. Ugh no idea if that's a good idea or not. Oh the school's got a NYC trip in April I'm hoping to go and bring a book with me to read than bringing my e-reader. I think a book would do than an e-reader anyway. I did a book bringing status when I went to school trip to Boston. This was rather nice that I had a book to read while not worrying about battery going dead from the e-reader's status while I'm reading it. Ugh I wasn't near a charging station for that e-reader to be charged hence I went with a paper book instead. Oh well. The trip to Boston wound up involving me visiting a museum with Morena and others of the deaf club members' gang. I had fun but I was rather bored with some of the exhibits. Oh well hence I read a book which I read the last book of the series. I had a time reading that book while on the bus ride to Winsted because I was too sick with the voice. I didn't finish the book instead I finished the part involving one character Jacob as named and skipped the rest of that book instead of finishing it. Ugh. I should have considered finishing that book despite starting that book. This sucks. Mom decided to ruin my mood tonight by being not available for a phone call at eight o'clock. I ranged her up at that time our regular time of eight o'clock.\n\nOperator claimed \"Line is busy.\"\n\nI did ask operator \"Please redial.\"\n\nI still got \"Line is busy\" response from the operator.\n\n\"Thanks.\" I said and I hung up as a result.\n\nUgh mom's phone's manners need work. She could have text emailed me by now but she balked and had a busy signal. Ugh.\n\nI said at six thirty or around that time in a text email message \"Its Victoria its 630pm home awaiting word so text email me mews ASAP.\"\n\nMom balked sending me a message by not texting me yet hence I at eight o'clock ranged her up and received busy signal's talk by operator. Mom sucks.\n\nVoice claims \"Mom's busy signal is on purpose.\"\n\nThis talk makes me think mom deliberately had her line busy so she won't have to talk to me at eight o'clock our regular time frame for talking. I'm just not happy with mom at the moment involving her damned phone silence. Ugh again.\n\nI said \"It's Victoria who's annoyed with your silence. Get off the phone I'm calling you. Text emails me mews ASAP.\"\n\nMom has yet to respond with her apology or that she was on the phone with someone. Ugh mom is so rude with her damned phone manners. Ugh.\n\nAround eleven o'clock in the morning I sent dad a text email message saying \"Hi Dad. How are you? I'm managed to arrange my dolls and books. I hope you got outside for a walk. It's mild out enough to walk with windows open.\"\n\nI wasn't kidding with that mildness temperatures like mom told me by phone around the ten o'clock hour. Ugh.\n\nI saying by text email message to mom in the morning around eight thirty \"Its Victoria its 830am I'm up so text email me mews on your day.\"\n\nMom text emailed me around ten o'clock saying \"Give me a buzz if you can mom.\"\n\nI was on the phone for thirty minutes despite chatting with Morena by cell phone's chat option at the same time. Ugh hence I not chatty with Morena and my mom both when I conversed. Ugh.\n\nMorena \"I ended chat for husband to use my computer.\" while mom and I continued our chat but I wasn't talkative with her.\n\nI was sick with nerve number two getting the voice going at the time and anxious to get off the phone for bathroom. Hence I wasn't talkative which mom hung up onto me as a result of both of us getting off the phone.\n\nI resumed my damn day doing nothing much besides watching DIY network's hour long show \"Building Alaska.\"\n\nI liked Alaska enough to visit that state but I doubt that I would be willing to live there. Ugh living in Alaska would be nice for vacationing but living there for awhile isn't my taste. Oh well. I watched HG channel's \"Fixer Upper\" on their morning marathon till one o'clock is when they went into a thirty minute \"House Hunters\" marathon I didn't care for. Hence I went with DIY network channel's \"Building Alaska\" about homes being built in Alaska. Sounds nice I guess. After that I wound up eating dinner which was partially burnt in the microwave oven. I forced myself to eat that food as a result of needing to eat and not wasting food. Ugh terrible big time to burn my food. Yuck.\n\nAround five fifteen I text emailed dad \"Good evening daddy. How was your day today? I managed journaling today by computer and written word. Also organized junk around here too.\"\n\nDad replied \"Cleaning all day.\"\n\nI think I should have thrown out that burnt food because I've been sick in the toilet with problems involving voice and diarrhea. Yuck.\n\nThe nerve for number two can get the voice going \"Are you forgetting something?\"\n\nThis talk gets the voice's blaring going on without an end. Yuck again.\n\nMom text emailed me at nine twenty saying \"Call mom.\"\n\nI was on the phone from that time till ten o'clock is when mom hung up our call after we both said our \"I love you\" messages.\n\nUgh I couldn't do anything to phone someone else so I said towards operator before I hung up \"Thanks.\"\n\nI tried to say thank you towards the operator for service before I hang up. Ugh.\n\nAfter I hung up I took my pill and wound up not doing much besides meaning to go to bed and sleep but I'm just not sure of when to sleep. Ugh again.\n\nMom last night by phone \"I apologized for my busy signal at eight o'clock. I was talking to Auntie Sandy who called me for a chat.\"\n\nUgh sucks at least that busy signal wasn't on purpose like what the voice called \"That was on purpose.\"\n\nOh well. Also I went to bed last night and slept till eight fifteen woken up by cutesy cat demanding me up and awake. Ugh I got up but didn't start my day till eight thirty five is when I showered and got dressed. I meant to go take my pills and go eat food. Ugh. I received nothing involving cable and electricity bills in the mail but coupons to Barnes and Noble. Ugh plus a check for nineteen dollars from housing authority group in Waterbury. Ugh sucks. I wound up paying my electricity bill which is a fixed payment price of ten dollars. Oh Yay for that. Also I used the coupons from Barnes and Noble to buy books for a discount. Ugh one of the books I bought were a very expensive hardcover set of seven books in the series that comes in a trunk like box. I used the twenty percent off coupon to buy those books despite already having a set on hand. Ugh. I'm always buying copies of books I have on hand for maybe keeping for either reading or just plain old keeping them for supporting the authors' works. Oh well this sucks.\n\nAnyway mom would throw an angry fit \"I hate it in response to you buying those seven books set for over hundred dollars despite saving ninety nine dollars using the twenty percent off coupon.\"\n\nUgh. I doubt that mom would be proud of me for buying those books.\n\nMom has brought up the subject \"You owing dad money for cat's vet bill like owing him one hundred and twenty dollars you still have to pay him for.\"\n\nUgh hence mom's insisting \"You not buy any books or anything expensive till you've paid dad off first.\"\n\nUgh terrible.\n\nI didn't tell mom by phone last night \"I bought books using that coupon from Barnes and Noble.\"\n\nI only told her \"I got coupons from that bookstore.\" but that was it involving telling mom that I bought books.\n\nUgh. I think my big mouth would one day tell mom that I bought books and make her upset as a result. Ugh this sucks big time. Ugh again.\n\nAlso a set of seven series' books \"You ordered off Bay's Books wound up declared shipped.\" but the seller didn't give a tracking number.\n\nUgh this sucks anyway. I don't know what to make of that seller anyway with their attitude involving money and selling books. Ugh.\n\nI wound up pinged by Morena who kept chat short as five minutes she went to resume work. I don't know what to make of Morena and her attitude involving chatting with me. Ugh terrible.\n\nThe books seven I ordered which the seller included a tracking number after awhile of slow response.\n\nThe seller even left me \"Five stars too for buying our product!\"\n\nUgh nice I guess. I don't care for the slow response to mail me the books. Yuck.\n\nAlso mom noticed my cardboard box of seven's books in hardcover on a visit to my apartment once she asked me \"Where you got that box?\"\n\nI told her \"Barnes and Noble for one hundred dollars.\"\n\nMom said \"You got me mad at you for owing dad money. I wasn't happy with you spending that money onto useless stuff.\"\n\nUgh.\n\nI did admit to mom \"I bought a memoir by a singer for twelve bucks.\" Mom said \"I wasn't happy about that buying.\"\n\nUgh that book was bought with a coupon discounted from original fourteen dollars to twelve dollars.\n\nUgh. \"I wasn't so happy about that news.\"\n\nAlso I talked to mom by phone last night which she assured me \"I'm coming up to see you today.\" which she did scaring me in the bathroom.\n\nI was in the bathroom washing my hands when mom tapped me onto the side freaking me out. Ugh not nice of mom to do that damned joke. Ugh again. Anyway mom brought a bag of sneakers for me to wear to use for my own two feet when walking around town. I put on one pair and wore than while I was out with mom till the shoe store is when I exchanged shoes. Mom and I went to Dublin Donuts for a lunch which was paid by mom's gift card including our drinks which was water like mom. I picked orange juice but mom picked water so I copied her and took out water instead. After lunch was to the town library where I picked up some paper versions of e-books I currently have onto e-reader. That e-reader is getting useless for me to use. I can't seem to get internet connection anywhere else than my home with that thing. Plus the battery of that thing keeps going down too much that I'm always charging that thing every damn day. Yuk. One of the paper books I picked turned out to be a seven day loaner I doubt that I would be reading or bothered to read anyway. I might as well return that thing to the town library unread out of that the book is a seven day loaner. I don't care for seven day loaners. They feel like homework assignment for a book report. Yuck terrible big time when's I checked that book out without realizing this crummy fact that the book is a seven day loaner. Ugh. After the town library was to a shoe store next door where I found a pair of baby blue sneakers I wore and tried on. I found the shoes fit me fine and were on sale for like almost seventy bucks. Mom used the trust fund's checkbook to pay for the shoes. Nice. The trust fund's checkbook mom seems to have only pays for me and my needs than anything else which my cutesy cat isn't qualified to use the money to pay for her needs. That trust fund totaling around ten thousand dollars is for me only and my needs. Ugh. Once mom and I finished the shoe store we went back to the car to drop off my older pair of shoes while I wore the newer pair of shoes. They worked fine for me. Also mom and I went to store where I found three pairs of pants to try on. I tried to fashion show them to mom but she wasn't around in the dressing room's area. Ugh I had to try on those pants by myself in the dressing room. One pair of pants turned out to be leggings. Another pair was sweats while the third was too big for me to wear. I wound up picking two pairs of pants that fit me fine which mom paid by trust fund's checkbook. Nice like I said. We after the store where mom bought a tee shirt in v-necked style for me to wear which I didn't try on Mom used her own money for the items from the store. I kept on noticing one customer kept on hanging around me spying onto me. I think my open sweater jacket was making the security of the store hang around me too much. Ugh.\n\nAfter the church was to church for confession which mom explained to the priest doing confession \"She's deaf and would need to write down the words of her confession.\"\n\nThe priest's understand of that talk.\n\nI wrote into my journal for the priest to read \"Lied about buying items when I should save my money.\"\n\nPriest wrote \"Please say the prayers of Lance Richard one time each. Are you sorry for your sins?\"\n\nI didn't say anything physically only nodded my head and gave a thumbs up.\n\nThe priest said something blessing like towards me then that ended confession \"I bless you.\"\n\nMom had her turn at confession which she went to sit down and do some praying after confession was to grocery store where we bought cupcakes from the reject bakery bin including ice cream. Mom bought her version of ice cream which I did the same thing copying her but I bought orange juice with my food. Oh well. We after the grocery store went to my home where I had a cupcake but balked eating ice cream. I didn't feel like eating ice cream. Ugh Mom piglet onto cupcakes and ice cream by bowl including using plastic silverware.\n\nMom insisted \"You to accompany me to church.\" which we sat around wasting time for four o'clock mass at church.\n\nMom tried a nap by armchair while I journaling by notebook. Baby cute kitten hung around being playful and being cute like a kitten. She clawed the armchair with mom sitting into it from the back. I had to chase her off which she ran off and hid behind the couch. Dumb cat dumb animal wound up playing chase games with me chasing her around while mom napped by armchair.\n\nMom ten minutes to four o'clock declared \"It was time for church.\"\n\nI brought along my bible to read which I only got to Genesis' part when mass was over with. The bible I brought with me had boring stuff explanations of the bible and translations in the beginning part than starting with Genesis' part. Ugh. Also my head was singing too much while I was at church. I swear I give off a noise in response to me suffering from a voiced attack of voice. Yuck.\n\nVoice was going \"Are you forgetting something?\"\n\nThe voice was chanting that over and over while I tried to pay attention to the mass in church including reading my book the bible I brought along. I found the paranoia wasn't much this time to my relief. Oh Yay for that.\n\nI took communion which \"I don't want to take that.\" but I took it from the priest by hand instead of having the man of cloth sticking it into my mouth.\n\nI habitually have the priest or whoever gives communion stick that into my mouth but this time I took my hand out for that situation. Ugh. After church mom and I went next door to pizza which I ordered bottled water and mom got soda with caffeine in it. Ugh mom took a caffeine pill in front of me despite I tried to take my pills involving mental health and hormones while mom was in the bathroom. Oh well. Mom whined of the pizza taking forever to cook which had bacon on top of the cheese pizza. The pizza left me gulping lots of water as a result of how hot it was. Ugh terrible big time when mom being hungry gobbled up her pizza but picked onto me when I ate my pizza slow.\n\nMom said \"I was in a hurry to get home before sunset. I don't like night driving and wanted to get home before it was nightfall.\"\n\nUgh poor Momsy. We both after our pizzas chewed gum and then mom drove me home which she washed her keys and glasses into my kitchen sink and used my bathroom then she left for home. I wound up turning on the TV to news but I didn't pay attention to that news because of being sick in the toilet with number two that made me nervous. Ugh I wound up around six o'clock going to HG instead and going onto the computer.\n\nI sent a lengthy email to Morena which I talked about my day with mom using multiple paragraphs.\n\nI sent an email to Jolica who responded with one word \"Cool.\"\n\nUgh I emailed a cousin an answer to her question involving a finished library book I finished. I tried to explain that book to Christina including the series in my email but I doubt I was very good explaining that book. Ugh. I can't seem to explain books towards people much in emails or same in person either. I can read a book but explain the contents to people aren't what I had in mind. Oh well.\n\n\"I spent today hanging out with mom eating meals like lunch and dinner. Also we shopped for some stuff like sneakers and pants including tops from target. After that was church for confession and mass. I had a good day today.\"\n\nThis is my email to Jolica by Chat's email which she responded with one word \"Cool.\"\n\nI sent that email to Christina but took out the word \"Today\" and replaced it with \"Saturday.\"\n\nUgh Christina was online but didn't respond to my email. Ugh again.\n\nAlso I sent a whining email to Morena of my mood and the same to Jolica of my depressed mood. Ugh this sucks when I whine to people and their not available for me to whine to about my mood. Ugh. I updated my online journal twice. One entry was a page length involving how bossy the voice was with the American girl dolls. The other entry was on my outing with mom on Saturday.\n\nI did delete the fact \"Mom paid for my pants and shoes using a checkbook to the trust fund.\"\n\nI didn't feel like broadcasting that I had a trust fund mom used to pay for my items. Ugh I also deleted the vulgarity words I used into the original journal which I deleted out names I changed to protect peoples' privacies including the same for mom which I don't say what name mom goes by.\n\nI just call mom by the word of \"Momsy\" or some mother like labeled name. Oh well.\n\nI wound up watching soap operas out of that was out of service till almost three o'clock is when I went to see if the channel was in service. The channel is showing a talk show at the moment involving this lunatic guy who's a closet comedian. I don't care for closet comedians or lunatics who are acting inappropriate for their ages like this guy in his talk show.\n\nHe's in his sixties and tries to be funny which makes me think \"What an idiot!\"\n\nI don't care for this guy's show and his antics. Plus he never helps gay or lesbian couples find love instead he focuses onto heterosexual couples. I swear this guy is anti-gay and anti-lesbian hence he's not helping either one find love matches. I just don't care for that guy's show for not helping lesbians and gays find love. He's more into heterosexual couples instead. What an idiot like I said. Ugh.\n\nI submitted a story earlier to a fantasy and science fiction magazine and got rejected today. Ugh makes me feel down in the dumps when I get rejected by the editors of that magazine. Ugh again. I feel like no matter what works I submit to that magazine their always going to reject me and my work. I feel like they got my name onto a rejection list to always reject period. Ugh sucks big time. Also I feel like the editors of that magazine like to reject people's work out of that the rejection gives them a kicking feeling of a high when they do that rejection. Hence their doing that damned rejection with me and my work. Yuck. I'm to do laundry today once I shower and go eat breakfast. Ugh can't wait to go wash and dry my clothes plus get my new pants washed and dried too. Ugh about time anyway. I submitted poems to that magazine and they still rejected me. I read the magazine's poems and found nothing to make sense involving what their looking for. The poems I read seemed to be based off famous authors' of poetry than anything else. Ugh that magazine for rejecting my poems. Ugh. Also annoying is when I keep on submitting work to that magazine I'm still rejected. Yuck I keep on submitting poems to that damn magazine and they keep on rejecting me. I swear the poems I submitted were good but their looking for name authors to submit poems than unknowns to submissions of poems.\nI talked to Momsy by phone for around an hour this morning.\n\nMom whined \"I skipping work due to a sinus headache I felt I shouldn't have called out sick but gone to work anyway.\"\n\nPoor Momsy!\n\nAlso I whined to mom \"My latest rejection of an Edenia like fan fiction story.\" which mom said \"I approved of that rejection.\"\n\nJeez mom for that attitude. Ugh.\n\nMom said \"I found the Edenia story inappropriate for you to submit to a magazine for money or acceptance. I think you were plagiarizing people's work like the author's work involving the Edenia's series.\"\n\nUgh again when's I'm depressed and down in the dumps at the moment that despite baby cute kitten's gone to hide somewhere and avoid me. Ugh dumb cat dumb me for slobbering the poor kitty with kisses and hugs fests to feel better. Ugh sucks. Also I'm to walk to school for the deaf club meeting which I'm just not entirely sure if I should go or not. I might as well go anyway and fidget spin while I wait for deaf club meeting to start. Ugh something amusing I guess for me to socialize today. Ugh again.\n\nI went to deaf club meeting today with the voice going off attacking me \"Are you forgetting something?\"\n\nYuck.\n\nI'm just not entirely sure if mom would be talkative by phone tonight despite she text email me \"I'm working five o'clock to nine o'clock tonight.\"\n\nUgh. Also I wound up since I'm home sick with the voice going off involving number two. Yuck again to have that problem. Ugh.\n\nI spent all afternoon reading and finishing this book borrowed from the town library which I finished. Oh Yay me. I rate that book three stars out of ten stars for creeping me out involving a lunatic acting out murders from a book a fiction book.\n\n\"I found the book rather icky with the themes.\" by email today Jolica said \"I found that subject interesting enough to consider reading the book.\"\n\nYuck but I did tell her who wrote that book. Also around Dellen's show I finished that library book I rate three stars online website. I wound up with the voice going as a result of me finishing that book. Ugh I find I was sweaty and rather hot from finishing that book. I don't care for the damned sweatiness when I finished that book. Yucky status anyway! I watched Dellen's show then saw most of the local news till like six thirty is when they went into world news I hate watching. World news always has doomed and gloom news I don't care for anyway. Yuck again!\n\nAlso I got text emailed by mom around seven thirty to phone me at \"You to phone me at eight thirty.\" which I did that after I read for an hour a book I finished that book later tonight. Oh Yay me.\n\nI talked to mom for fifteen minutes I whining \"I wanting to finish reading that Harry Potter book.\" which mom was understand allowed me to get off the phone.\n\nOh Yay. I was sick with the voice at the time around eight o'clock hence I sick in the toilet with problems plus Sam tried to get onto my lap to comfort me but I couldn't withstand her. I wound up around eight thirty phoning mom even while sick with the voice attacking me. I talked to mom for a short time then after that went to back to that book which I finished tonight. Oh goody and Yay for me.\n\nI shook off the voiced attack last night around eleven o'clock but I didn't go to bed till around eleven thirty with the heat on low. Oh well. Also I woke up around six thirty for bathroom which I didn't flush the toilet but resumed sleeping till eight fifty is when I woke up from a weird dream. I don't remember what weird dream I had as a result of not writing that down. Ugh I remembered a weird Edenia series' story weird dream involving one female character named Natalia Mahalia herself turning out to be a cloned copy of a deceased baby child by her mother Empress Anastia Juliet Palina Bornova. I think I dreamed of a scene involving Natalia. Oh well. The scene involved traveling through a hospital setting and reaching a tube room holding tubes of water that's large sized for adults to be contained into them Natalia following her mother with people through that area. I wound up dreaming of me into a bathroom or a waiting room waiting for something while reading a magazine. I think I used the facilities of a hospital room then sat down waiting for someone to enter the room like a doctor's examination room. I don't get it that dream anyway.\n\nI wound up sick with a problem involving number two and the bathroom triggering the voice to go off bothering me. Yucky problem to have! That weird dream of me in a doctor's room using the bathroom and waiting for someone was from me staying in the hospital for four days while sick with a problem. Ugh I just remembered that fact. Ugh. I noticed I get memories into weird dreams sometimes that turned out to be something else than I remembered. Oh well. On Monday night the twenty-fourth I was sick with voice attacking me all night into the morning of Tuesday morning. I wound up reading multiple books as a result of me sick with the voice and managed to finish one library book that was due in a week's time frame. Oh Yay me. Anyway I'll find out on Tuesday April second of I hope my number two sample providing results of what's going on within my inner system. Ugh I can't wait to find out and find out what the hell's going on within me. This sucks when I have a doctor's appointment that day which I hope to find out the results of that testing status.\n\nYesterday I bugged dad \"I want to do errands outing.\" which he text emailed me \"Later.\"\n\nI bugged dad around ten o'clock \"I want to do errands' outing.\"\n\nI bugged him again around noon something he sent me a whining texting message \"I agreed to pick you up at two o'clock for errands.\"\n\n\"Ugh library is closed at two o'clock.\"\n\nDad arrived with his all black car that's black inside and outside which I said to him \"Nice vehicle.\"\n\nAnyway I went to the town library which was closed around two o'clock so I dropped off a library book and donation into the library's book drop. I dropped off a library book I doubt I would read including donating a book I don't think I'll read which I dropped them both off. Ugh. After library was groceries which I got some pills for free but they weren't enough to fill in a month's time frame. Ugh also I got shampoo two bottles for seven bucks which was on sale buy two for seven dollars. Oh Yay me. I got two Terrific Terri's books both in paperback I was admiring online Barnes and Noble's website I aimed to get around to reading when I do. One book was a knockoff of another author's writing which was just some advertising to make people buy that book and read it. Ugh terrible. Also I found toothbrushes' coupon from my receipt which I used to buy four toothbrushes in a package on sale for three bucks discount. Oh Yay me. I used money into my safe to pay for everything in drug store including a little of my card's money too. Oh well for me. I went grocery shopping after that which I bought lots of food totaling fifty two dollars and some change leaving what's left of my food stamp card's money totaling in ten dollars and some change. Ugh. Also I put the safe's money into the bank out of not keen of keeping money into my safe. I don't feel right keeping money in huge amounts into my safe. I preferred to keep jewelry instead. I just do.\n\nI told that fact to mom by phone last night \"I don't like keeping money into book safe.\" Mom took the news well. Oh well a pity. It was a good thing I put that money into my bank account because Barnes and Noble had a sale of seven series e-books from each six dollars and ninety nine cents to one dollar and ninety nine cents each. I took advantage of that sale to buy those e-books which I already have the paper copy of. Oh well.\n\nVoice and Morena would be picky onto me \"You buying books you already have a copy of.\"\n\nLike me buying e-books I already have a paper copy of something that I get pickiness from Morena. Voice picks onto me for checking out paper copies of e-books I already have downloaded into my e-reader.\n\nUgh can't seem to stop that pickiness' talk.\n\nI wound up using the heat on last night which I should have turned that off before I went to bed. Ugh. I got a hot flash with sweatiness during my sleep hence I had to turn off the heat and sleep without that on. Ugh. Also I woke up around midnight for that hot flash and turning off the heat. Yuck to turn off the heat but I was hot flashing with sweatiness. Ugh terrible big time.\n\nI slept fine till seven thirty is when I woke up with voice blaring at me \"Get up! Call mom!\"\n\nI didn't bother and resumed sleeping till eight fifty which I started my damn day. Ugh.\n\nMom text emailed me around nine o'clock a minute before that saying \"Call me please.\"\n\nUgh I missed that text email message till ten o'clock is when I checked the cell phone for charged status. Ugh this stink big time when I miss mom's texting messages. Ugh.\n\nI talked to mom for five minutes which mom ended phone call and I went to do some chores around here. I threw out two finished notebooks of journaling I finished yesterday. Oh Yay me for finishing those notebooks. Ooh goody. Also one notebook took me seven hours to write the remaining pages into it to finish that notebook which I was done around four thirty. Ugh I had another notebook in my purse I was a few pages from finishing so I finished that too after dinner. Ugh nice. I threw out the notebooks this morning and noticed the lot was empty of cars except one useless car that's not in operation. I figured that I would do laundry which I did that chore today and finished around twelve thirty. I have to put away my clothes when I get the chance to do that putting away chore.\n\nI wound up on the phone with an operator that refused to cooperate with connecting me with mom. Ugh hence I blame that operator as a result of balking to connect me with mom like I hoped would do. Ugh.\n\nI wound up with the voice going off tonight \"Mom's to text email me a response for phoning tonight.\"\n\nI tried to phone her at seven o'clock but she ignored me according to the operator. I'm not entirely sure of when mom would respond to my texting message tonight for a phone call. I hope the time is soon enough because I'm going to be sick all night with these bathroom sicknesses. I wound up on the phone with mom for a short time till like I had to get off the phone out of suffering from the voice attacking me at the time. Ugh. I wound up out with Ted, Mars and Rachel to the zoo. I went as simple as that to that zoo. Yesterday I put on my black ski sweater and pink pants including my blue sneakers which I wore to an outing with the deaf club members' gang to the zoo. Oh Yay me.\n\nTed got Rachel to pick me up \"I got confused to which car was Rachel's in the lot.\"\n\nUgh terrible big time. Oh well.\n\nAnyway Rachel drove to Mars's house which she picked Mars up who slept in the car ride to the zoo. Ugh I didn't sleep but I tried a few times. Ugh again. Arrived at the zoo which the parking lot was crowded full of people and hardly any room around for Rachel to park her car. Ugh Rachel had to park her car in an adjoining park as a result of the crowded parking lot. Ugh. Also I wound up eating two cheese sandwiches around eleven o'clock before Rachel picked me up around noon.\n\nI shouldn't have eaten those sandwiches \"I didn't want to whine of needing to eat.\" while I was there at the zoo. Ugh again.\n\nI went to the zoo which Christina helped me \"There's a discount for the price of admission.\"\n\nNice of her which we paid for our tickets then walked around inside the park. Nice. I saw nothing involving cheetahs but I saw cat like animals that were tigers and leopards. Ugh I was hoping on viewing a cheetah but I didn't at all. Oh well. I saw multiple wolves of different colors including a red panda I could have snapped a phone photo of but I didn't bother. I also saw a bald eagle too. I even snapped three phone photos of a tiger sitting down resting. Cute I guess.\n\nAfter that we went to eat which I had two peanut butter cookies and tried Christina's mozzarella sticks but Maureen being critical of me being lactose intolerant \"You to quit eating that including eating the rest of my French fries.\"\n\nUgh.\n\nThe park closed around four o'clock to my relief Morena said \"I all decided to go to a restaurant in another town that had a deaf head cook for eating more food.\"\n\nNice.\n\nI while there had garlic bread than any of the cheese pizza which Morena \"I'm still picky onto you being lactose intolerant. I insisted you focused onto something else than the pizza.\"\n\nWe after eating Rachel drove Mars to Al's where Mars grocery shopped which I journal by notebook while in the car ride to Torrington. Mars didn't take long but he fell asleep again in the car ride to the grocery store including to his house where Rachel dropped him off. Ugh poor Mars for not sleeping much. After Rachel dropped Mars off was dropping me off which I wound up sick in the toilet with problems that triggered the voice to go off bothering my paranoia. Ugh I talked to mom by phone during that status for like ten minutes.\n\nMom let me go off the phone she thinking \"You was tired from the walk in the zoo.\"\n\nI didn't tell her that I was sick with the voice going off. Ugh I don't tell mom by phone of me sick with the voice going off mostly. I don't bother.\n\n\"I'm working onto a story.\" and mom falls for that trick always and we hang up.\n\nUgh. I was sick in the toilet till like two thirty is when I felt something else than number two so I watched TV till three o'clock is when I went to lie down. Sam got my closet door open during me asleep while I was in bed trying to shake off the voice's attack. Yuck. I noticed the voice chants whenever I'm tired from doing nothing but watching TV including editing stories. Ugh something I noticed and didn't care for anyway. Ugh.\n\nAlso I flushed the toilet around three twenty in the morning when I shouldn't have bothered. I'm terrible big time with that toilet's flushing after the neighbor complained of my noisy toilet. This is a yucky problem to have but I went to bed and slept till seven o'clock woken up by my noisy head. Ugh. I swear I couldn't sleep much after seven o'clock hence I getting up and sending email to Jolica who responded right away with a facial picture of hearts in eyes. Cute I guess. Also I emailed Christina who's not online but will respond later whenever she's free. I noticed that Christina responds online the computer than onto her cell phone. This is something I noticed I do towards people emailing them in Chat's email like Morena I tend to text email by cell phone in Chat's email. Oh well.\n\nUgh I talked to Morena by chat's option which she cut me off whining of \"My keyboard not working properly.\"\n\nJeez Maureen! I talked to mom around ten thirty for around thirty minutes.\n\nMom was boring me with her talk \"I'm itching to get off the phone to bug dad for a drive to library.\"\n\nUgh mom agreed to get off the phone which I hung up. Oh Yay.\n\nAlso I text emailed dad \"I want a ride outing request.\" who said \"I'm out of having physical therapy.\"\n\nUgh jeez dad. I wound up around eleven thirty after eating some food walking to drug store by myself while wearing a winter coat.\n\nUgh I tried to get a prescription for hormones refilled by the pharmacist who claims \"The twenty first is when that'll be filled.\"\n\nUgh. I got my mental health prescriptions including a strawberry like seltzer water drink I drank outside the store on the way to the school's caf\u00e9 for a sandwich. I had peanut butter and jelly sandwich wrapped in plastic then after that I had that strawberry water drink too. Also I was sick in the toilet with problems that made it hard to walk to church Saint Joseph's for mass bulletin or to the town library. I walked home instead. Ugh. I should have walked to the town library because dad's proved to be too lazy to drive me tonight to there.\n\nI called library and asked them \"You to set three books aside for Me.\" which they said \"We did that by email.\"\n\nThanks to dad's unwillingness to drive me I have to wait till Saturday to get those damned books. I'm dying to read those damned books but I can't because of dad's laziness and that tomorrow the library is closed due to an eatery like holiday.\n\nI got home and wound up with the voice singing which gave me a bit of a paranoia attack. I went onto the computer and shook that off. Yuck.\n\nI around four o'clock wound up with the voice chanting \"Are you forgetting something?\"\n\nMostly the voice chanting that over and over till like four thirty is when I was sick in the toilet with a problem hence that cut the voice's chanting off. Yuck. After voice's chanting I at five o'clock took my pills I got from the drug store. I was out of pills for evening including emergency supply for dinner. Hence I had to walk to the drug store by myself for pills refills pickup. Ugh. Also I didn't eat much healthy food for dinner. I had crummy waffles two of them including some chips from a blue bag that's some Spanish like chips. Ugh I also had water like I've been having with my meals than anything else. I haven't had anything to drink besides water from the sink in the kitchen as my drinks. Ugh also while at the drug store I settled for some seltzer water with a strawberry like flavor which I'm not sure if that's got sugar in that drink or caffeine like substance. Hence I didn't have anymore of that drink for dinner or for snack. I had a snack earlier around one thirty during a Nashville talk show that's seems to be filmed six months ago and aired six months later. They show summertime stuff in their show when's the time's not even summertime but wintertime. Yuck.\n\nToday's a holiday involving Lance Richard the god king. That's nice I guess.\n\nLast night I text emailed dad \"You home?\" which he was with his question \"What do you want?\"\n\nI said \"Library to pickup books their closed tomorrow.\"\n\nDad agreed by texting \"Ten minutes.\"\n\nDad wound up driving me to the town library where I originally checked out three to read but there were two books at the checkout desk I saw that attracted my eye so I checked them out. Ugh nice.\n\nThree of the books I checked out were by an auto buy author I favor but I haven't yet bought her e-books of her latest series yet. Oh well I meant to buy them using a gift card but I don't want to. I prefer to wait till those e-books are on sale for half off discount instead of buying fifteen bucks for them. Ugh. Also I saw two books on the checkout desk that attracted my eye enough to check them out. Oh Yay for that checking out. Oh well. I went home and wound up exchanging my clothes to pajamas then cutesy cat lap sat me. I wound up around seven thirty starting that book Verona Vander's latest book in her seven series. I only read that book for thirty minutes till eight o'clock is when I ranged mom up. Oh around the seven o'clock hour I wound up with the voice going off. Yuck. Hence I had to read a book out of trying to avoid the inner noises' blaring. Yuck again! I was on the phone with mom till close to nine o'clock is when we got off the phone. I didn't do much last night other than journaling by notebook and watching the stuff on HG channel involving house flipping in Las Vegas. Ugh boring show. I hate house flipping. I don't care for house flipping. Yuck. I prefer HG to not to show house flipping series on their channel but interior design shows instead. Ugh. HG used to show interior design shows and now their cancelled all of them. The channel is showing house flipping themed shows including house hunting themed shows too. How boring! I hate house hunting including house flipping. I don't care for either one of them situations onto HG channel. Yuck. That channel seemed to be showing house flipping than anything else nowadays. Ugh this stinks.\n\nI crashed around ten o'clock and slept like a log till woken up by the voice going off \"Are you forgetting something?\"\n\nUgh plus cutesy cat was cuddled bumming me at the time which made it hard to wake up and start my damn day.\n\nUgh I woke up around nine forty in the morning to mom's text email \"Call Mom!\" including Morena's email.\n\nUgh again. I wound up onto the phone with mom in my pajamas which I talked to mom till ten fifteen is when she got the operator to give the stop keying symbol. I hung up and went online finding Morena wasn't online for me responds to her email message. Ugh.\n\nI wound up with a weird dream \"Me packing my clothes and items into red suitcases.\" something I told to mom by phone.\n\nI'm not sure of what Mom thought of that weird dream \"I took that dream as good news.\"\n\nUgh. After phone call I finally showered and took my pills then ate crappy crummy foods out of cravings to chew something. Ugh I've been eating foods non stop since ten thirty in the morning since I took my pills. I also have been eating dairy foods too. Ugh again.\n\nI emailed Morena and like I told her \"I was eating out the remainder of my foods before I go buy more.\"\n\nUgh something I think this is bound to make me sick in the toilet with problems including an all night marathon of being sick with voice and number two too. I emailed multiple people which only Jolica responded with a short message reply.\n\nUgh Jolica is always short with her messages to me \"I know.\"\n\nChristina is hardly online to reply to my messages and so is Lizard Lizette who's named Lizette but insisted on the nickname of Lizard. I don't know what to do today besides slobbering the baby cat with kisses and hugs fests out of unable to get outside walking around enjoying today's weather. The weather is warm outside for windows open but rather cloudy and gloomy outside. Yuck. This weather is bound to depress me actually. Ugh.\n\nI read and finished Charisma Chic's book yesterday afternoon. I found that book rather informative involving interior design. Ooh goody I guess. I rate that book ten stars out of ten stars for being informative involving interior design including Charisma explaining her interior design choices for rooms. Nice.\n\nAfter that I started again \"Nana's Kisses.\" by Janna Japan a book I've been reading galore and having trouble trying to finish. Ugh I think I read one hundred pages of that book till I got one hundred and forty five pages left to finish. Oh Yay me.\n\nAlso I read \"Children's Blood\" by Anna Alina's Bloody series last week on Friday till I got one hundred pages of that book and decided to go take a break for reading something else instead. Oh well.\n\nI started before dinner last night this library book \"President's Tester.\" by January Japan I'm not sure is a relation to Janna Japan despite the same last name. I found that book rather interesting from what I'm reading. I've read and skimmed \"The President's Son\" by Japan because I read that book years ago and never bothered to get around to reading the \"President's Tester\" book second in the four book series. Oh well.\n\nAnyway I finished \"Children's Blood\" a book I read entirely in one sitting on Friday while sick with the voice's attack and the bathroom. Ugh this sucks to be sick with the voice and bathroom. Ugh hence I up for hours reading a damn book. Also these voiced attacks hitting me have hit on Fridays for two weeks and kept me up for hours. Ugh sucks when's that has to happen. Ugh plus I'm not looking forwards to Friday this week because Saturday is the New York City trip by bus. I'm not so sure if I can sleep on Friday night into Saturday morning. Ugh. I might be up for hours reading a damn book out of excitement to sleep including me sick in the toilet with problems. Ugh again.\n\nMy big mouth talked to mom by phone \"I buying four signed Charisma Chic's books around seventeen dollars each.\" which mom said \"I scolded you for buying those books. I think you should have just bought one than four.\"\n\nUgh mom said \"I scolded you of this buying.\"\n\nMom has been on my case \"You to save money for the cat's vet bill including for the doctor's bill.\"\n\nThe bill involving doctor's is around one hundred and forty dollars.\n\nYuck mom said \"I expected you to pay for the bill entirely yourself.\"\n\nUgh hence I'm to do that yuck again.\n\nAlso I've checked my bank account \"I'm discovered I've got one hundred and fourteen dollars left to pay for any cat vet bills my cutie requires.\"\n\nUgh mom whined by phone \"You having to pay for the cat's vet bill by yourself without any help from dad or anybody.\"\n\nUgh I have a trust fund mom uses to pay for my stuff but she told me \"Trust fund's money won't go to your cat. You'll have to pay for yourself out of your own money. Hence trust fund I uses to pay for you is for you only and not for my cat.\"\n\nUgh again. I hate Chat's email service because some of the stuff I see post online are inappropriate for viewers to view. Mostly that sexual themed stuff I don't care to view very much which includes porn and crap. I hate Chat's because of this stinking porn. Yuck. I hate being online Chat's involving seeing inappropriate stuff I don't care for. I hate that website to use for posting links for my stories that get ignored and not liked Ugh. I hate Chat's because hardly anyone likes my posts. This is the same online my blog's website which hardly anyone likes my posts or messages.\n\nI say \"Ugh to the people for their ignorance. This sucks.\"\n\nYesterday was the ten year anniversary of adopting cutesy cat into my home. The munchkin's birth date is in July starting on July eighth than any other date because the vet accurately figured out her age and figured she's born in July. Cute I guess. I didn't do much yesterday other than skimming the ending parts of \"Nana's Kisses.\" a book that's giving me trouble reading with a lack of motivation to finish. Ugh hence I skimmed the ending as a result. Yuck. Also I wound up reading a bit of \"President's Tester\" till I realized there was something involving controlling people with mind control that creepy me out. I couldn't finish that damn book as a result or skim the ending parts.\n\nI gave up that book out of creepy out \"You should have finished that book.\" as blared by voice.\n\nI finished \"Bloody's Bone\" by Anna Alina which I rate an eight for amusing but the ending part bothered me and left me a bit bored to tears. Ugh hence that rating including that rating of four out of five stars online a website. Ugh. Anyway I did get my signed Charisma Chic's books in the mail.\n\nOoh Yay for that but I admitted to the priest later for confession \"I lied to mom by phone on the prices of those four books I ordered.\"\n\nMom said by phone \"I think you ordered underneath ten dollars each.\"\n\nPriest wrote \"Why did you lie to mom?\"\n\nI wrote \"The books all cost me one hundred dollars total than the prices of forty bucks like I lied to mom.\"\n\nUgh terrible when I've been going to this church for confession to the Lance Richard god king order in the city. I walk to that church and wait my turn for confession which is in a private room of a priest with a facial appearance of my father Jinks Montreal himself always displaying black beady eyes and never speaking to me. The priest seemed to have taken a vow of silence to me for he's always writing down his words in cursive handwriting including never bothering to sign language his words. Oh well.\n\nMom said by phone once \"I've been seeing this priest for confession at Jacinta's Church which is on Main Street in Win's Ville which you should go.\"\n\nI went out of some compulsion like feelings of Meritanians manipulating me to go.\n\nMerra said by mind talk to me blaring \"Just go!\"\n\nI wound up hit with a compulsion to go as a result which I walked to Jacinta's church and went inside. The church looked like it was formerly used for a forgotten god or something I'm not sure of what god but I suspect the High Council. I found people waiting in line to a room which I joined them followed by them going inside one at a time. This priest I saw was twin to my father's looks by facial appearance but hair was different instead of long black hair had short curly balled hair. I wasn't sure what to make of this priest who had a yellow pad.\n\nThe priest wrote \"What sins do you wish to confess? Write that down than talk the room's not sound proofed.\"\n\nI know I have something to confess to the priest when I go for confession is saying to the priest \"I lied to mom on the prices of books I ordered despite her nagging me to save my money.\"\n\nUgh no idea what the priest would say in response \"Are you sorry?\" I'm guessing.\n\nPriest wrote \"Just admit this sin to your mom and chant the prayer 'Ay Kabaiya!' three times for pleading to beg for forgiveness.\"\n\nI was about to write \"Okay I'll do that.\" when the priest removed the yellow pad and waved me out.\n\nUgh rude but I guess he's not happy with having to do confessions for other people who are just using the priest for whining of some horrible news. One night I started a religious themed book by King Kingsbury called \"To go to the moon\" about the survivors of the transfer from planet Earth to Aire as that world should be called. Ugh I'm just not entirely sure if that author should be writing about tragedies that hit the USA. Oh well.\n\nI mentioned by phone \"I using Weather's Field as a town name and the apartment complex I lived in called Sharon Lane.\"\n\nMom wound up throwing an angry fit while on the phone mentioning \"I'm insisting you take those names down involving legal issues including laws to use actual names of people, cities and locations.\"\n\n\"Ugh now you tells me.\" I said in response.\n\nMom said \"I insisted you delete the actual names of people cities and locations from your stories.\"\n\nUgh I told her what she wanted to hear \"I'll be doing that deleting as you requested.\"\n\nI wound up not telling mom that I self published online my Edenia fan fiction story online called \"Susan's Denial\" for free online that self publishing Smash-words' website where I've self published stories before. Ugh.\n\nMom has been throwing an angry fit onto me in person and onto phone \"You doing someone else's work into stories for money and stuff.\" which is the same hissing angry attitude towards me \"You using actual names of people and locations.\"\n\nUgh again.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if I get a big mouth courtesy of the Meritanians thinking it's funny to embarrass people I compelled to say \"I self published Susan's Denial online Smash-words website.\" which knowing mom she'll say \"I insisted you take that story down and delete Susan's Denial from your files of stories saved.\"\n\nUgh terrible big mouth me which I blame the Meritanians thinking \"This is funny to embarrass people.\"\n\nUgh I'm surprised this mood to journal took till now Monday the thirteenth. Ugh I don't get it my mood at all anyway. This sucks.\n\nAnyway Morena by email said \"I mentioned forty bags of donations for forty days of giving for Lancemas the holy days. I urged you to do that giving up stuff for Lancemas like forty bags of stuff a day for each day of the holy days.\"\n\nOh well. Also today I gave up five books I doubt that I would read or read again. I donated those books as a result to the school's free bookshelf including magazines mom gave me I doubt that I would read. I also was urged to give up a book on a soap opera that was defunct but I didn't think I could donate that damn book. Ugh I meant to donate it or reread that book but the soap operas are kind of defunct hence I keeping that book as a result. Ugh. Soap operas aren't much around TV or around internet. I hardly see much TV's soap operas on TV other than four of them that I don't bother to watch much. Ugh.\n\nThere's one soap opera I don't watch on TV I'm not impressed with that soap opera. I prefer to watch soap operas on other channels instead. I find \"The Hour Glass\" soap opera boring me to tears hence I don't bother to watch that much. Ugh I do watch \"Rags\" soap operas including \"Medical Hospice\" the soap opera but I don't watch the soap operas very much at all. I just don't anyway.\n\nMorena can be a manipulator towards me doing things I don't care for.\n\n\"I'm donating towels.\" I said by email to Morena who said \"I insist you laundered towels you're donating instead of just giving them to me to donate.\"\n\nUgh jeez Morena. Ugh again. Also I read this author's book about apartments I'm finding that book rather boring me so I skimmed the ending. Ugh I rate that book two stars online where's I'm on a book's profile website. Ugh I doubt that I would be reading anymore of that author's work. Mom has that author on a no read list out of that she is more of a journaling writer than a descriptive personal writing person unlike a popular romance author Nikolina Nikolai I favor that works for Veronica Thomas Incorporation. Ugh again.\n\n\"This author Nikolina Nikolai.\" according to mom on the phone \"is more descriptive with her scenes describing them and stuff involving writings.\"\n\nUgh lucky Nikolina Nikolai on selling her works very well and earning tons of money off her writings. Ugh lucky. I can't seem to convince the public online this vanity press's website to buy my stories. The public seemed inclined to get my stories for free. The public sucks big time when they prefer my stories free than buying any of my stories for fees. Ugh I hate the public. Also annoying is when I'm stuck having to use this vanity press website for publishing stories that a fantasy and science fiction magazine rejected. This sucks to do that but I don't get much feedback onto my stories from family and friends. Ugh. Family and friends don't give me much feedback on what they think of my stories hence I have to submit them to magazines including self publishing them online with a paragraph to ask for commentary posting involving what readers' think of the story. Ugh. I hate it when people don't give me constructive feedback I want involving my stories. Ugh dad trashes my stories and finds them not good. One friend online uses excuses to avoid responding to my feedbacks' requests like excuses of being too busy to read my stories.\n\nI around two thirty bugged dad with a text email message \"I request you to take me out for errands.\"\n\nDad responded right away instead of forever \"The outing is at the time of four o'clock.\"\n\nDad arrived around four o'clock \"Where to?\" which I said \"I insisted on town library to go driven to.\"\n\nI dropped off three library books one I already read or skimmed and didn't read entirely. Oh that book was on the apartments I found boring and skimmed the ending.\n\nThe second book was Nikolina Nikolai's book \"Immortality\" the last book in the one's series I didn't agree with the book's contents involving the previous book. I thought the story was a tad too dark and negative something I didn't agree with. Yuck. I don't know if I would get around to reading \"Immortality\" or not. Oh well. Also dropped off a paper version of an e-book I have on e-reader already called \"Fallen Flat King\" by Matilda May. I meant to get around to reading that book whether it's by e-reader or by paper version. Ugh don't know why I haven't despite downloading the e-book version. I went to the rejected bookcase for withdrawn books and picked up four books which they appeared to be vampires or paranormal bent themes books. Nice I guess. I picked up Lora Lorena's novel \"Rule Breaker\" I'm not sure of why that book was withdrawn other than that book's story was probably not popular among library patrons or something like that status. Ugh. I found and picked up a second book Michelle Michael's book \"Flame Thrower\" which I think that book is a teens' novel by the size and picture of it involving that book. I'm not sure of that anyway. I picked up a third book Carly Caroline a Chicago vampires' novel. I've heard of Caroline's work but never gotten around to reading her work before. Oh well. I also picked up a fourth book by Carly Caroline novel into her urban fantasy series. I think the series is told in first person because of the female on the cover involving urban fantasy. I'm sure of that status. Ugh.\n\nMorena told me by email \"I have advice for you involving clutter in your apartment. My advice is one thing in an equal value thing out. I meant four books you take in you have to give up four books for donations like that for an example.\"\n\nUgh. Anyway I wound up with the voice picking onto me last night around four forty five after sickness in the toilet. Ugh triggered paranoia to go off as a result. Yuck cutest cat tried to comfort me by being social. I took my pills and ate food then wound up onto computer. Also during the computer's time the voice quit but continued while I was on the phone with mom. I was on the phone with mom for almost two hours with a break of ten minutes in between phone calls. Oh well. My stomach still acted up when I was on the phone with mom hence I in the bathroom around seven twenty twice but I didn't flush that time. I flushed the toilet after I got off the phone with mom around eight fifteen. Ugh. I watched the cute brothers' show which was nice but too bad one is married and the other is probably has a girlfriend to marry later. Oh well. The brothers are easy on the eyes to watch and funny anyway. I like their show their silly sometimes. Oh cute. I woke up around eight thirty this morning with the voice going off waking me up like an inner alarm clock. I think I was sick in the toilet multiple times despite the noises of my head. Ugh boy was I glad to take my pills and eat some chocolate spread for breakfast. Ugh glad to take my pills and cut the inner noises. Ugh. Love my cute little baby bundle of fur to slobber with kisses and give her cuteness hugs. She's so tolerant of her paycheck for free eats around here. I love that little stinking cutie so much. Aw cute.\n\nI emailed Lizard Lizette involving Morena's advice which she responded right away \"That's good advice for sorting.\"\n\nWell nice. I emailed Jolica involving that same talk but she's not responding right away or reading my message which I guess she's busy with work. Oh well. I emailed Morena who was online but ignored me. I guess she was on her cell phone checking Chat's email while ignoring pings from people. She won't download the chat option by cell phone out of that she doesn't want to be tied to her cell phone involving that option. This is a pity anyway.\n\nYesterday I emailed Morena \"You want to meet for a lunch date at school?\" which she said \"I agree for a lunch date at school around noon.\"\n\nOh Yay for that lunch date. Plus the day was nice and sunny and a bit cloudy. Oh well the clouds threatened to rain a bit but never rained actually. Ugh. I wore my NYC pink hat to the school while wearing a pink Denver Colorado tee shirt and sweat pants.\n\nI think Morena said \"I approved of your outfit.\"\n\nNice. Anyway I went to school and met Morena for lunch which Mars joined us by buying Mickey D's food for Morena's and himself which he ate in front of us. Nice. Also Morena wound up onto her cell phone talking to whoever was on there.\n\nShe told me \"The caller was someone named Son Johnson whose wife was in the hospital that might need my interpreting services later for being deaf.\"\n\nUgh also Mars left which I wound up sitting with Morena for awhile till one o'clock is when's she left carrying her lunch and cell phone to her ear. Ugh. I went to the free bookshelf in school after Morena hit the elevator which I wound up finding that ideal book I had in mind to read wasn't there in the bookshelf. Someone took that book before I could take it to read. Ugh hate that happening. Yuck. I walked home and wound up watching HG for two hours with the cat on my lap. Cutie pie was lap happy once I was home and social. I guess she missed me and loved to sit onto my lap like a cute kitten mitten. Aw. HG aired this damned Caribbean show involving house hunting in the Caribbean than anything else as a marathon. They showed newer episodes of that series around nine o'clock that night. Ugh boring. Also Dellen's show didn't have Dellen as the host instead the show had a guest host which I found was funny. That guest host was funny as a bunny ear cat hopping around cutely. Aw nice I guess. Oh well. I got an issue of gymnastics in the mail involving the national championships for colleges. They featured Okie Dokie the college for women as nicknamed by the High Council that won the title. The title for men was dubbed Waterford despite known by another name by the High Council. Nice I guess. I have yet to read that magazine. I meant to get around to reading gymnastics but I'm just not in the mood. Ugh terrible. Anyway after Dellen's show I saw the local news which I watched till weather report then I went back to HG's Caribbean show which bored me that around five forty five I went to local news for sports report and stuff like that. I skipped world news because they habitually show doom and gloom news than anything positive. Yuck something I don't care for watching anyway. Ugh.\n\nAround seven o'clock I wound up onto the phone with mom for over an hour till like close to eight fifteen is when mom started whining \"My stinking apartment stinks! I insisted on getting off the phone to get outside!\"\n\nUgh. I got off the phone and didn't do much this evening other than lap sat by the cutest cat who tried to nap onto my lap multiple times but got off and went to the couch. Aw poor cutie booty the baby cute kitten. I crashed around ten o'clock last night and wound up cuddled bummed by the munchkin who bathed herself too much annoying me. I hate it when's she's bathing herself while next to me in my bed because that annoys me. Ugh she finally quit that and went to sleep with me sleeping fine. I woke up this morning for bathroom and figured since I was up I'll stay up. Also cutie was no where in sight on my bed but on the couch onto her familiar spot for sleeping. Aw cute love that little munchkin bunches. She's so cute. Speaking of the munchkin she's got a bald spot onto her back that she's scratching repeatedly despite my efforts to keep the apartment clean of dust and dirt. Ugh I think cutesy cat needs a vet appointment for a steroid shot for her allergies. This is a pity. I've got one hundred and eighty dollars saved into book safe I'm hoping is an enough to pay for most of the baby bundle of fur's vet bill when it's time for me to get her to the vet for a steroid shot including a checkup onto that bald spot onto her back. Ugh. I just have to let dad know that I'm requesting a vet appointment for the baby cat so he can drive me to the vet for when's it's time for that to happen. Ugh can't wait to let dad know of this including calling the vet. Poor baby cute kitten with her allergies. Aw love that little munchkin bunches but hate it when's she's suffering from allergies that makes her itchy enough to scratch a bald spot. Poor munchkin!\n\nI wound up with a weird dream involving gymnastics' gym and some fat guy. Ugh that fat guy was obese and refused to let anyone use balance beam equipment for gymnastics. Ugh don't get it that dream. That fat guy wound up fighting with people for use of a gymnastic balance beam with me putting a hand onto his back and keeping him sitting up while he was pushing or fighting with people. Fat guy wound up pushing something off the balance beam's area and walking off after that fight. I got up off the balance beam's area and went to sit onto the rugged floor to watch a TV a flat TV screen airing something. Ugh. I don't get it that dream anyway. I don't do gymnastics anymore since I'm likes too old to do that sporting event. Also that dream had people doing gymnastics onto equipment including equipment that was older and not for gymnastics uses but seemed for that sporting. Ugh. I don't get it that weird dream or what the hell it means. Ugh again. Also I emailed Auntie Berliner on books I was reading which she emailed me a recommendation involving a vampire series I've seen on TV but never bothered to read the books. Oh well sounds like fun I guess. That vampire series was for teens something I saw at the town library I never bothered to get around to reading till Auntie recommended them to me. Ugh. I have library books on hand I've meant to get around to reading which I'm like halfway through one of them \"Unmade songs\" by Katie Caitlyn. I'm finding that book rather interesting so far from what've read. Problem is I don't remember much of book two to refer to book three I'm currently reading. Ugh I remember some details of that book but I'm not entirely sure if I remember what's that book is about. Ugh sucks. I might have to reread the series trilogy \"Magical Majesty\" again to remember what book one and two are about despite reading book three. Ugh this sucks like I said when I don't remember much of books' contents. Ugh again.\n\nI wound up walking outside in the weather to the town library where I wound up with the voice going off. Yuck. I sorted of tolerated that noises by going to the town library to sit around reading and finishing this library book \"Unmade Songs\" by Katie Caitlyn. I finished that book oh Yay me.\n\nI couldn't sleep much since last night. I kept waking up for noises of my head including the bathroom which I didn't flush the toilet out of trying to not be noisy for my downstairs' neighbor. Ugh. Also I wound up accidentally turning on the heating blanket hence I discovered this fact when I went to resume sleeping despite cutie the cat pointing that out to me. Ugh again. I turned off the heating blanket and adjusted that thing somewhere where I couldn't accidentally press the button or switch. Ugh hate it when's that has to happen. Yuck. Anyway I read the pill bottle's label for my hormones' pills and discovered this taking those pills involved the morning than in the evening. Hence I have to quit the evening taking them and take the hormones into the morning with my other pills. Ugh sucks. I opt not to take my hormone pills last night hence I wound up with voices talk and sick like problems into the toilet. Yuck but I tried to sleep the best I could. Unfortunately around five o'clock something in the morning I gave up sleeping and got up to send email to people. Ugh. I emailed Auntie a short email then I did the same to Morena who was online but on her cell phone hence her ignorance. Ugh Jolica hasn't bothered to reply to my email in awhile. I guess that she's busy or something hence Jolica's lack of response. Ugh terrible. I wound up home with the voice going off involving the toilet's number two. I think I'm creepy out involving mom's visiting me. Or Mom's coming to see me or something like that fact. Ugh. I watered and fed cutest cat food for she needed more food anyway. Oh well nice of me to feed her more food and water. Nice.\n\nLast night I wound up with the voice going off bothering me involving the damn toilet. Yucky problem to have but I forced myself to talk to mom by phone without alerting her of that problem. I talked to mom for around an hour till seven o'clock is when we finally got off the phone. Oh Yay. Also last night I read a library's version of Carly Caroline's work involving Chicago vampires which I finished. I was creepy out too much to sleep when ten o'clock rolled around so I read and finished \"Singer\" by Carly Caroline. Ugh.\n\nDuring the ending part of Caroline's book I felt creepy out on finishing \"Singer\" but I finished that book I rate four stars out of five online good reads' website. Oh Yay me.\n\nAround two o'clock the voice quit its attacking barrage onto me which I went to bed and slept despite a little creepy out by the inner noises going off.\n\nI slept till five o'clock woken up by bathroom but I thought I would sleep some more on the advice of the voice blaring at me to do that which I did \"You should sleep some more.\" I heard blared into my mind.\n\nI woke up around seven o'clock and decided to send emails to people out of needing something to do while computer staring. I find that computer staring while sick with the voice creeps me out bothering my paranoia quite a bit hence I don't computer stare. I find that reading a book with the TV on is much better for my paranoia and creepiness feelings despite not bothering to do the computer nowadays. I still use the computer sometimes whenever I'm sick with the voice but that's only before I go to eat dinner even with the voice going off. Yuck. I checked out the tenth edition anniversary of Chicago Vampire series by Carly Caroline which I discovered the main story was twin to a library book I finished hence I skipped that and skimmed a bit. I wound up reading the bonus content of that book which I haven't finished yet. Oh well.\n\n\"Morning Sweetie: I'm in church then work nine to three give me a buzz tonight at six pm love you mom.\" This is mom's text email message to my cell phone this morning.\n\nI didn't respond out of unsure if mom would get that message.\n\nMom whined by phone \"I've been getting multiple texting messages that were spam I deleted.\" hence I haven't really text emailed her a response.\n\nOh well.\n\nMorena by emailing me in Chat's emails said \"I suggested you get rid of books that aren't Nikolina Nikolai's works.\"\n\nUgh she knows I favor Nikolina Nikolai too much to the point of collecting her works. I also thought of getting rid of books that were already on e-reader too. I also kept some books that weren't easily found by e-reader or e-book form. Ugh.\n\nMorena said \"I insisted you sort out fifty books.\" which I did that job but not much but I bagged the books too into cloth bags for her to pick up on Thursday Morena said \"I'll come by on Thor's day also known as Thursday to pick up the books.\"\n\nI can't wait to get rid of those books. Ugh. Also can't wait to get rid of a bookcase and have Morena take that thing off my hands. I've got ideas on what bookcase I should get rid of which I'll go see if I can do that getting rid of that bookcase I've got in mind. Ugh again.\n\nUgh Wednesday night I had a little trouble motivating myself to sleep into bed to be wake up by alarm clock at seven thirty. Ugh I woke up around six o'clock Thursday morning by cutie pawing me awake and sitting onto my front on her butt. Cute I guess.\n\nAnyway I wasn't able to open a window because of the rainy stormy weather that day yesterday. Yuck and terrible weather anyway. Ugh. Also I showered around eight o'clock starting my damn day. I had a debate on what to wear with my clothes tee shirt wise and sweater wise. I picked a tee shirt in blue and a sweater in pink including my blue sweats and wore my sweater jacket.\n\nUgh Ted text emailed me around eight fifty \"Morena was going to be a little late.\" which I responded on his request \"Text email me that you got the message.\"\n\nI said \"I got your message.\"\n\nAfter that I spent the rest of the time peeking out the window waiting forever for Morena's arrival which she arrived around nine fifteen.\n\nMorena text emailed me \"I was here in the lot.\" as I got my two bags worth of books including a mini skirt I was donating.\n\nAfter that Morena drove to Ted's apartment which she picked him up \"Ted sit in the front while you sit in the back.\" She ordered.\n\nTed is always talking to Morena while in the front hence Morena's wants him to sit in the front's seat for talking instead of back seat. Ugh hence I'm always seated in the back. Yuck. Anyway I charged my e-reader intending to read that thing while in Morena's car but picked one of the donated books I figured I'll read instead and keep. Ugh I wound up reading a withdrawn library book I was donating I wound up keeping as a result. Ugh. Morena arrived to the mall in a location I wasn't sure of where it was because I was book reading. She parked the car and then we went inside where we met her friend Tanner who seemed to need to be on a diet. Her friend was on the pudgy size side like I and Morena are while Ted's needs to gain weight. We all took a walk around the mall only walking a part of the mall then went to eat lunch.\n\nMorena said \"It was okay for you eating cheese onto your food finding eating that once is okay for you.\"\n\nI wound up sick in the toilet with problems soon after eating that food. Ugh yucky and terrible to have that result in the bathroom. Anyway Morena drove us to Ilia as that store is called by the High Council in a town dubbed Heaven next to the ocean. I haven't seen the ocean in awhile or a long time so the viewing was rather nice. We after arriving was sitting around waiting for Tanner and another of Morena's friends named Tina to show up. Nice.\n\n\"I considered buying a chair for my office.\" As said by Morena but she said \"Nope don't want to buy that chair.\" when's examining the box for that chair.\n\nUgh a pity that Morena bought a bottle of wood polish than anything else. Also we went to the caf\u00e9 for drinks for Tina to eat food. Morena had soda while I had water both our drinks in glass cups. Morena is still onto a no plastic kick involving products. She won't use products that come in plastic. She's trying to eliminate the uses of plastic from her house including using them for anything hence she's refusing products' buying that are in plastic containers. Ugh nice idea I guess. After our drinks and food we took a walk around the store then went to the other part of the store where people could load bags for products including carts too.\n\n\"I insist that you to buy a cushion for you computer desk's chair on that your original cushion is shredded.\" As said to me by Morena.\n\nUgh I did that buying costing me six dollars and got some change back. Ugh.\n\nMorena said \"Nope.\" to me buying a stuffed toy or some bath towels I was thinking \"That's an impulsive buys.\"\n\nUgh Morena managed to convince me \"You to just to buy the cushion.\" which I did.\n\nAnyway the weather rained when Morena drove to the mall and kept up the rainy weather when she drove to Ilia. After Ilia the weather quit raining but was terribly cloudy and miserable. Yuck. Morena drove Ted and I home which on the way out of the parking lot I saw a couple that reminded me of a couple I've seen online next to a car. I didn't point them out or anything just guessed that the couple was them but I didn't see their faces. I only saw their body shapes including their blonde hair to assume that status. Ugh.\n\nI wound up paying attention on the way home with the voice going \"Got to pee!\" over and over involving pee urges.\n\nUgh plus the voice started chanting its familiar question \"Are you forgetting something?\" in response to me late taking my pill at five o'clock.\n\nMorena stalled on getting me home instead she drove to Ted's and had me \"You to help him haul some stuff from my car's back end into his apartment.\"\n\nUgh once done I conversed with Morena in the car \"\"I living in the apartment complex where Ted lives for his apartment seems nice.\"\n\nMorena said \"I disagreed with your talk because of the lengthy walk to school from there.\"\n\nOnce at home I text emailed dad \"Good evening Daddy I'm home with cutest cat roams got dropped off by Morena and is slobbering kitty with kisses.\"\n\nDad text emailed me twice saying \"Cute\" at first then said his traditional message \"Ok.\"\n\nTed said \"I noticed today that you don't say much besides the words 'Ok' and 'Fine' to me whenever I tried to get you into a conversation.\"\n\nThose words are dad's traditional familiar words he always habitually says to me than anything else. Ugh dad always says those words to me in texting messages than anything else messages' wise. Ugh again.\n\nAfter I got home mom text emailed me \"Call mom if you're home.\"\n\nI ate my dinner which was toasted bagel with cheese and orange juice. I shouldn't have eaten cheese with my meal but I wasn't in the mood for a lengthy nuking food time because of having to phone mom. So I made my sandwich with my pill I took and ate that then after that phoned mom. I was on the phone from five forty five to eight ten in evening. I guess we both had lots to say involving my outing with Morena which we discussed locations including how Morena's got to there by driving on roads. Nice I guess. During the phone call I wound up with an upset stomach that involved cramps for number two. Ugh mom put me on hold multiple times but I didn't using the toilet instead jotted notes by journal instead while on hold. Oh well.\n\nAround eight ten in the evening mom started whining \"I'm wanted to get off the phone.\" so I agreed by saying \"I love you lots Momsy Bobsy bye.\"\n\nI hung up and did something involving my cramps in the toilet then got into pajamas. Cutest cat ever got onto my lap but she didn't stick around long enough she got off. Aw poor cutie pie I guess was cold hence she lap sitting me. I opened the windows above the air conditioner last night out of how stuffy it got into my apartment. The weather once I was home for the evening wasn't too bad for windows open. I had the windows open all night which wasn't too bad. I woke up this morning for bathroom and with the sunlight shining gave up sleeping. I got up and figured I would send people emails out of needing something to do before I go shower.\n\nI wound up into a talk with Morena by Chat's option onto cell phone but she's not being too talkative with me \"Sorry I'm working.\" She said.\n\nUgh. I'm just sick with a voice attack at the moment involving the toilet hence I sick repeatedly with the toilet at the moment and trying to tolerate that noisy issue till I go phone mom at eight thirty tonight.\n\nMorena ended chat which I wound up onto the phone with mom for a short time because mom was working a morning shift at six o'clock. Ugh also once off the phone I wound up editing one Edenia series' story out of needing something to do. Ugh.\n\nAnyway yesterday I roped dad \"You into driving me around town.\"\n\nDad picked me up around two o'clock an hour after Morena said \"I'm working hence I ended chat.\"\n\nMorena said \"I insisted you get rid of ten books.\" which I donated to the town library yesterday including some library books I doubt I would read or finish. Oh well.\n\nDad drove me to town library where I donated books \"I asked librarian for Malinia's memoir 'Shining time.'\"\n\n\"We don't have that book but we would have to inter library loan for you.\"\n\nOh well sucks big time ugh. After library where I almost forgot to donate my bag of book I had on hand which I forgot to get rid of those books till I almost left the library is when I remembered that joke. Ugh dumb me. Anyway after library I went to drug store where I bought toothpaste and a notebook out of that the store's notebook supply wasn't much.\n\nI did whine to the cashier a guy \"You don't have much supplies in notebooks.\" But I still bought a notebook a two subject one. Oh well.\n\nAfter drug store was grocery shopping where I bought food and used my clothe bags to carry my items to dad's car.\n\nDad said \"I'm not coming into the store instead stayed in the car.\"\n\nOh well nice I guess. Also I wound up once I was home watching TV show Dellen's Show then a bit of local news blaring about a golf tournament. Boring me to tears actually so I went to HG to watch till six o'clock is when I phoned mom. Oh I made sure to eat dinner before phoning mom. Oh nice. I was on the phone for around two hours till eight o'clock is when we got off the phone and I went to watch TV watching HG channel stuff rerunning and then nine o'clock a newer episode. Nice. I crashed around ten o'clock last night and woke up for bathroom around six o'clock in the morning but I figured since I was tired I might as well continue sleeping which I did fifteen minutes to nine o'clock is when I woke up and started my day.\n\nI remembered having a weird dream of visiting a manicurist's nail salon for a manicure which \"You want your nails done?\" I received rude reception including a half done job onto my nails.\n\nThis seemed to have something to do with me being a walk in customer \"Your not here for an appointment.\"\n\nUgh also the nail salon seemed to be having a party or something involving food too hence people hanging around eating their food. Oh don't get it this damned dream anyway. Yuck. I've meant to chop my nails out of that their getting long might be too long for me to type. Oh well.\n\nAlso had a weird dream of me visiting some school looking for a bathroom toilet and couldn't find it enough \"Where's the bathroom?\" I asked a teacher where that was.\n\nAlso wound up into a restaurant where I threw dishes from the table onto the floor like a rude kiddy. Ugh don't get it this damned dream anyway.\n\nYesterday mom came over after a short phone call in the morning \"I'm coming to see you as you requested.\"  \nI phoned her and asked \"Can you come up and see me?\"\n\nWell nice I guess of mom to come see me. Nice! Also I gave mom books that later took them back and donated them to the town library.\n\nMom said \"In the car smelled the mustiness of the books. I donated the books.\"\n\nI was giving her including me donating books I wasn't going to read. Ugh sucks.\n\nMom met Steve Stevenson a Tom Mindbender Thunder look twin's guy who likes me in the town library.\n\n\"Steve this is my mother raiser Beatrice Bee. This is Steve Stevenson.\" I introduced him to my mom that they both had a chat while I went to the library's desk \"I'm asking about a Nikolina Nikolai's book 'Glass island's' due date.\"\n\n\"Book wasn't due till two weeks later.\" which I didn't recheck it out instead figured I'll quickly read that fast and be done with soon enough I'm hoping. Ugh.\n\nAfter library was to stop and shop using cloth bags to hold our purchases in them which mom whined \"The grocery store charging ten cents for plastic bags hence I gave you tons of cloth bags to use.\"\n\nOh well. After stop and shop was home to nuke some pizza into the oven which I ate but wound up sick in the toilet with problems later on.\n\nUgh I whined to mom on the phone \"My problems with dairy intake later on that made me sick into the toilet.\"\n\nMom said \"I suggested you eat food that's non dairy.\"\n\nOh nice I guess.\n\nMom said \"I have to show you forms involving going over the trust fund's paperwork including how much the money was left in the trust fund.\"\n\nAround nine thousand dollars and some change left into the trust fund. Oh goody. I'm hoping to whittle down the trust fund's amount so I can get the money deposited into my bank account for me to use instead of having mom using it for paying for stuff. Ugh. Also I'm no longer onto energy assistance matching payment plan at the moment. I need to start saving money for my electricity bills including for cutesy cat's vet bills too. Ugh.\n\n\"I asked on using the trust fund to pay for my electricity bills including for my cutest cat's vet bills.\"\n\nMom said \"I claimed that the trust fund is for you only and not for the cat or for anyone else which includes those electricity bills you have to pay yourself.\"\n\nUgh sucks.\n\nMom said \"I insisted on you going to church for confession.\" which I said \"I have nothing to confess to the priest.\" I was out of not willing to confess anything to the priest.\n\nOh well.\n\nMy confession I would say \"I would be feeling like punching my cat with my fists.\"\n\nI hope not on that punching status. Ugh. I had a calico cat I would punch with my fists and hit out of being angry from school and not having an outlet to get rid of my anger hence I would fist the cat Patty with my fists. Ugh quite a pity that she's doesn't care for me fisting her. Yuck. Also Patty was put down humanly for having an inoperable tumor that was giving her pain and making her not eat food. Ugh she was put to sleep as a result. Oh she went willingly for being put to sleep without any defiance or anything like that. Ugh nice of me to do that to her after the abuse I gave the poor kitty with my fists. Ugh. Anyway dad and I adopted two kitties Tiger and Willow a few weeks later that were kittens' ages. Tiger seemed to favor me while Willow was favoring dad and she kept on favoring him over the years. I don't think Willow liked me anyway. Ugh. I doubt that I would be getting a calico cat after Samantha's life gets to the point she needs to be put down humanly. I don't think I could withstand a calico cat. I abused one and another one didn't care for me instead favored someone else. I don't think I'll ever get a calico anyway. Yuck. I think I'll get a black cat like Samantha my cutest kitten is entirely black and refer her as some cutesy name of Demeter from my father raiser Jinks Montreal having a cat with that name. Cute name I guess.\n\nThose names of Demeter and Vikat were names I wanted to name Tiger and Willow originally but dad said \"No not those names! I don't want to be reminded of something horrible with my life!\"\n\nWe picked Tiger for tiger tabby stripes and dad picked Willow from his favorite TV show he favored enough to tape. Ugh. I blame that trust fund as reason why's I'm not earning extra money off my writings. Ugh I blame the fact that the trust fund's existence is why's I'm seemingly not earning any money of my own from anything like my writings. Ugh. I'm seemingly losing money off impulsive buys including me buying things I shouldn't have bought in the first place.\n\nUgh this is something mom noticed and pointed out to me \"You seemed to be buying things you shouldn't be buying.\"\n\nI think Morena said \"I noticed this fact too.\" and has been picky onto me buying things. Ugh again. I blame the fact that the trust fund's existence is why I can't seem to be earning extra money off my writings or anything I sell online Bay's too. I blame the fact that the trust fund being there for me is why I can't seem to earn money of my own. Yuck. I find if I try to earn money of my own I won't get the money at all. Ugh something I noticed involving me having a trust fund blocking me from earning extra money of my own. This is a yucky problem to have. The lack of money I'm trying to earn of my own involving my own writings is the pits when's I can't seem to convince the public to purchase my stories. All I get is public wants my stories to be free than buying the stories for fees. The public sucks with their attitude involving my stories. Ugh. Baby cute kitten wound up lap sitting me which I snatched her up for a nice hug fest and kisses too. Cutie tolerated the hug and kiss fine. I guess that's her paycheck for free eats around here. Aw cute. Also I emailed dad and Jolica this story of Lance Knight. I figured I'll include stories into my journals if I'm inclined to do that inclusion. Oh well.\n\nI tagged Morena \"Hi Morena you around for a chat?\" who replied \"I'm here so what's mew with you?\" which I was online talking to her for thirty minutes till around eleven o'clock is when she ended chat \"I have to go do something else like chores.\"\n\nUgh.\n\nMorena by her emails' messages said \"I suggested you go out for a walk today to take advantage of the nice sunny day to walk to the green in town and sit down reading a book.\"\n\nI don't feel like doing that today because I'm sick in the toilet with problems including today's Sunday I don't normally go out for walks much on Sundays regardless of the weather.\n\nAlso I text emailed dad \"Good morning daddy check your email I emailed you a short story involving Edenia series I'm working on. Let me know what you thought of story.\"\n\nDad according to cell phone read that text's message but didn't respond. Ugh sucks.\n\nAlso mom around eight o'clock in the morning sent me a text email message saying \"Good morning lovey, I'm working nine-thirty am to two pm. Have a good day, call me at six pm. Love you, mom.\"\n\nOoh all I have to show today is problems with the toilet that's bound to annoy the neighbors for uses of the thing. Ugh.\n\nMorena said \"I suggested you get outside walking around.\" but I don't do that on Sundays like I stay home bored to tears and clean the apartment than doing anything else. I also slobber the furry baby too much too. Poor kitty has gone to hide to avoid me slobbering her head too much with kisses including pick me up hugs. This is a pity when's the kitty's fed up with me slobbering her too much that's she's gone to hide and avoid me. Ugh. I'm just annoyed by my head thinking ideas or scenes for Edenia series but when's I go to type those ideas down the mood evaporates or goes away leaving me frustrated and stuck with those damned ideas into my head I can't seem to type down. Ugh again. I'm also annoyed that I can't seem to write down those damned ideas either despite thinking of them. Ugh. I spend my time writing journaling thoughts than writing stories for me to copy onto computer later. Oh well. Also those notebooks are for me to fill in with my writings then once I finish those damn things I throw them out into dumpster with my garbage. I symbolize throwing out the notebooks with throwing out problems than keeping the notebooks on hand. Oh well. This garbage's notebook tossing out is something I've done multiple times including emailing to people that I do that habit.\n\nMorena said \"I know you do that habit of notebook throwing out. I encourage you to do that but I'm not buying notebooks for you to write in if you're going to toss them out into the dumpster.\"\n\nThis sucks. Plus I noticed with my writings I seemed to be recycling already published stories to have this character's point of view or changing one story to have something else. I like I did with one story involving something I changed into a point of contact story between a group of people and talking sentient plants that live in the ocean. Ugh. Sometimes I can't seem to type anything brand new down or think of anything involving ideas to type down hence I'm stuck recycling stories. I don't seem to like this damned stories' recycling. I prefer to think of something brand new than the same old recycling lined stories to have this story's point of view or something else. Ugh even annoying is I'm sending stories and poems to magazines that are being picky with what story or poetry they accept. So far I've received nothing but ignorance and rejection. Ugh I can't seem to get any of my written words accepted into magazines. I find my written words have something into them that turn people off from wanting to buy my stories or same for accepting them for publication. The public like my friends and family sucks when's they won't very descriptively tells me what I need to do towards my stories to fix them up for public to buy them. I find I emailed short stories involving the Edenia series to friends and family multiple times. They won't respond with their creative critique on what they think needs work with my stories. Only Jolica responds by Chat's email with her opinion but that's about it. I don't get responses from dad or anyone else besides her involving my stories. Ugh. I saw a Nikolina Nikolai's e-book on sale for online Barnes and Noble's website which I purchased but won't read. I have yet to bother to read and finish an e-book by e-reader.\n\nI meant to do that reading even voice is nagging me \"You to do that reading too.\"\n\nUgh I only have sixty dollars and some change left into bank account before I get my monthly paycheck within a week's time frame. Ugh I'm hoping the bank won't get greedy and suck most of sixty dollars out of my bank account. I owe dad money for glasses which I already paid dad twenty dollars. I was hoping to use one of the twenties in sixty dollars to pay dad what I owe for glasses' bill. Ugh. Also I was hoping on using the remainder of sixty dollars to put twenty into my book safe for cute baby kitten's future vet bills. The rest of that for spending money onto something I need to purchase out of not using my card. Ugh again. I've been more interested into reading paper copies of books I have by e-reader than reading those e-books.\n\nUgh voice has been nagging me \"You to read the e-books by e-reader!\" but I won't bother doing the reading.\n\nUgh don't get it at all. I don't get it why's I won't read and finish an e-book by e-reader when I'm more inclined to read the paper copy which is either paperback or hardcover. Ugh. Some books I have on hand are awkward for me to read because their hardcover but I'll still read them despite balking on reading the e-books version. Oh well. I wound up around five thirty with the bathroom's problems triggering the paranoia to go off bothering me.\n\nUgh I ranged mom around six o'clock who whined \"I'm not being ready for a phone call. Call me back at six thirty.\" so I ranged her up again around six thirty and talked for twenty minutes.\n\nMom said \"I suggested you ring me up around nine o'clock.\" but I didn't bother out of creepy out by the voice and paranoia hitting me at the time.\n\nI sort of gave up telling mom by phone of me creepy out by paranoia and voice hitting me at the time. I just use excuses to get off the phone with her and not phone her again that evening.\n\nI read and finished \"Glass Island\" by Nikolina Nikolai last night which completion of that book creep me out including cutesy cat sitting onto my lap too. Ugh cutesy cat was cold and tried for my lap but I couldn't withstand her very good hence she got off and clawed the armchair as a result. Ugh.\n\nLast night dad text emailed me \"I'm going to Sanne's residence in Greenleaf.\"\n\nI asked dad \"Do you need me to feed the kitties?\"\n\nDad replied \"Yes.\" answer including \"There's a time frame of feeding the cats.\"\n\nUgh. I wound up with eating dinner around five o'clock with my pill then around five thirty I walked to dad's house carrying my purse in a backpack form including a memoir Ugh. Only Willow was around for food which the other kitties hid and didn't show themselves around dad's house. Dumb cats dumb animals. Also I walked home and watched the remainder of local news till six thirty is when they went to doom and gloom world news I hate watching so I went to HG till seven o'clock is when I ranged mom up for a phone call.\n\nMom kept call short as thirty minutes due to whining \"I'm falling asleep.\"\n\nUgh quite a pity anyway which I hung up and watched the HG's channel till ten o'clock is when I went to bed crashing asleep willingly. Ugh. Baby cute kitten was friendly last night enough to demand attention including trying to play chewy with my hand petting her. Dumb cat dumb animal. Ugh dumb me for petting her cuteness that she wanted to play chew with my hand. Oh well. After that I crashed and slept till six o'clock in the morning woken up by bathroom but since I was tired I crashed and slept till fifteen minutes past nine o'clock.\n\n\"Check your cell phone!\" I was woken up by my noisy head involving my damn cell phone receiving texting messages from mom and dad.\n\nUgh mom around eight o'clock text emailed me \"Call mom!\" a phone request but I was asleep at the time so mom added \"The phone request to seven thirty tonight.\"\n\nUgh.\n\nAlso dad said \"I begged you to go feed the kitties!\"\n\n\"I refuse.\" Which I said then around ten o'clock after dad begged again \"I beg you to go feed the kitties. I have no one to feed them with.\"\n\nI relented and went to dad's house feeding the furry bundles of his. Tigger was around acting as mister social while Walnut was meowing at me with her big mouth. Willow was around stuffing her face and acting like a snob on the bob. Oh Bogey I nicknamed Bogart was no where in sight. I guess he was hiding somewhere into dad's bedroom. Ugh poor kitties. I walked home and did laundry and finished that chore. Oh Yay me. I just have to put away clothes including pajamas and bath's towels then I'll be done as a doornail with that chore. I can't wait anyway. I've got Pavel Palin's memoir \"Water's Son.\" I'm currently reading despite calling that book done online Good Reads' website. I rate that book two stars online that website. I consider that book done with as read despite reading it in real life. Oh well.\n\nI'm reading Palin's book out of that mom talked onto the phone \"I give a subject on varying reading material. You should read more of non fiction than fantasy fiction you seemed to be reading way too much of than anything else.\"\n\nUgh. I forgot to update my computer journal with my online journal. Oh well. At least I remembered to do that updating. I'm still updating my computer journal with those online journaling entries to save on hand if I think it's worth doing that. I wound up sick I'm home sick with the voice going off scaring me at the time hence I turned on the air conditioner and TV and went onto the computer to update my computer journal out of needing to waste time till five o'clock pill taking time.\n\nUgh Canada's main channel went out of service hence I'm stuck with National as a result. Yuk. Also cutest cat avoided me this morning with my attempts to pick her up for a slobbering kiss and hugs fests. I guess that the baby cat isn't in the mood for a hugging and a kissing ritual. Aw poor kitty poor me.\n\nOoh the baby munchkin turns thirteen this month which \"She's.\" according to mom by phone \"A geriatric cat that's old in sixties like sixty five.\"\n\nUgh jeez mom for ruining my mood involving the baby cat's and her lifetime of living with me. Aw.\n\n\"Throw her outside\" says voice who adds \"Get another cat.\"\n\nI hate the talk by the voice making it tempting to remove baby cat for being old and get a kitten to have for slobbering. Yuk.\n\nYesterday mom after a late phone call came over to see me which was a good thing. Mom and I went to Dublin Donuts which I had lunch with her eating food even though I ate an hour ago. Ugh.\n\nAfter we had lunch mom drove to Americaversal store where she told me \"I insisted you purchase silverware for ninety four cents each buying three of them for me to use.\"\n\nI wound up buying them including a notebook for journaling. Ugh Americaversal store is some big major chain that sells items besides food. After store we went to library where mom stayed in the car while I went inside. I couldn't get into the mood for books for me to purchase or check out. Ugh walked out empty handed. Oh well.\n\nAnyway mom drove me home which she said \"I insisted you walked me to the car.\"\n\nI did despite itching to use the toilet hitting me at the time. Ugh I went back into my home and did my business then sat watching HG's \"Fixer Upper\" a defunct big state eye's base show. I saw Delen's show that was a rerun which I didn't mind because I got to journal by notebook wasting time till four o'clock local news' aired their program. Nice I guess.\n\nI around six o'clock ranged mom up who picked up to whine \"I'm not being ready for a phone call for I'm busy eating.\" according to her. \"I want to ask you to call me back at seven o'clock in an hour's time frame\" which I did.\n\nUgh mom was rather rude with her ending the phone call around eight o 'clock \"I love you lots Victoria talk to you tomorrow.\"\n\nShe didn't let me get a word in involving loving her which I would have said \"I love you Momsy Bobsy.\"\n\nUgh I hung up and wound up watching a TV show on HG channel around nine o'clock airing a newer episode then I crashed at ten o'clock. I had a weird dream involving a floor length apartment in a building that appeared to be a city or something like that. I don't get it that dream anyway. I just don't at all. I dreamed of having a Chihuahua dog as a pet for walking with while outside wandering around the building's inner workings that seemed to be like a maze. Ugh.\n\nI dreamed of me running for a titled position which I said \"I agreed to jointly join Morena Morgan for that titled position.\" despite someone else a guy was favored and seemed to be arrogant to think \"I'll win no matter what you campaign for ha.\"\n\nUgh just don't get it that dream anyway but the comment sounded of Ramses' talking commentary into my mind despite he doesn't broadcast talk to me occasionally. The Meritanians that comment to me the most are Merra and Tank which I'm always hearing them blaring talk. Merra makes sure I hear her broadcast all over the place like I'm cued to her. I sometimes have trouble telling the difference from my noises of my head from her talk.\n\nHer voice sounds similar to the noises of my head hence I have to type it down and then ask Merra \"Did you say this to me?\"\n\nMerra sort of evades answering that question instead just continues onto her joker jokes.\n\nI dreamed of a TV's show characters' puppets I tapped onto their backs and they retaliated by trying to bite me.\n\nI signed in American Sign Language as that referred \"No biting!\"\n\nAlso those puppets turned into my cat playing chew the hand that feeds her game. Plus there was a Chihuahua dog hanging around that had puppies which I took the mother dog and put a leash on her while in an apartment and walked outside into a maze of an inner building I trying to get outside but couldn't figure out where. Ugh.\n\nI think my eating same meals for lunch and dinner twice in two days have caused me a problem with the toilet.\n\nI was sick earlier with the voice going off \"Are you forgetting something?\" including hearing \"You need to eat better foods.\" Which sounded of Merra's talk but I wasn't sure.\n\nCutest cat hung around me watching TV while sick with the voice going off. I was rather confused to her behavior or why's she was hanging around me. These hangouts turned out to be her trying to comfort me with the voice going off she sensed that problem. Also I wound up not sleeping very good last night into this morning. I woke up early as four o'clock in the morning for pee urges and resumed sleeping till daylight around six thirty or around that time is when I woke up but resumed sleeping till eight thirty is when I got up. Ugh.\n\n\"Are you forgetting some? Are you forgetting something?\" sang voice in response to me having number two urges in the toilet.\n\nUgh I don't know what's making me sick in the toilet tonight other than blaming me eating two twin meals for two days in a row hence I'm sick tonight. Ugh again.\n\nI text emailed mom by cell phone saying \"Its Victoria its seven o'clock I'm home awaiting word so text email me mews ASAP.\"\n\nI meant to phone Momsy tonight but I'm not sure if she's going to be willing to talk by phone tonight at whatever time's she's free for a chat. Ugh. Mom's got an early morning work shift tomorrow at six o'clock hence she's not going to be chatty by phone tonight. This is a pity towards mom for working that work shift soon after working an afternoon work shift till six o'clock in evening. This is a pity.\n\nI wound up yesterday cleaning the bathroom and then vacuuming the living room.\n\nTed text emailed me \"I want to come over and check your work involving cleaning.\"  \nI said \"Okay come over.\"  \nHe obeyed which he told me in person \"I approved of your vacuuming but found your cleaning in the bathroom dirty.\"\n\nOh well \"This is the same for cleaning the kitchen which is dirty too.\"\n\nI gave Ted a bag of clothes \"You to donate for me.\"\n\n\"I'll do that fine.\" he said.\n\nNice. After Ted's visit I finished a notebook worth of journaling but I used sloppy handwriting to finish that notebook. Ugh. Also I wound up tossing out magazines into a plastic bag with that notebook. Ugh again.\n\nI told mom \"I tossing out of magazines.\" by phone which she was whining \"You needing to scratch the name and address off the magazines.\"\n\nUgh jeez mom.\n\nAnyway mom ended phone call thirty minutes later whining \"It's too hot in my apartment I need to get outside to cool off.\"\n\nUgh. I wound up watching TV last night including journaling into several notebooks. I picked a notebook but I didn't feel like journaling into that notebook so I put it back. I picked another notebook which I wrote using sloppy handwriting till I realized the journal wasn't what I had in mind to journal in so I put that back. I picked up a spiral bound three subject notebooks that was sitting onto my dining table which I wound up using and writing with neater handwriting. I wrote sloppy at first then after that was done I wrote neatly as I could. I couldn't read my handwriting in its sloppy form hence I opt to write neatly. Oh well at least I can read my handwriting anyway.\n\nOoh cutesy cat's sleeping on the couch's footrest while purring her motorboat off. I petted her cuteness galore while she was on there. Cutie tolerated the petting fine with her motorboat going off. Aw cute love my little munchkin bunches. Today's Saturday which the HG channel is airing crummy shows onto their cable channel today. Yuck I don't care for those shows their airing today. Ugh.\n\n\"The town library is open four hours today from ten o'clock to two o'clock.\" According to librarian when I ranged her up asking \"What are the hours of the town library today?\"\n\nI've got no idea what I can do while I'm there besides purchasing books or checking out books to go with the pile I have already. Ugh again.\n\nI sent an email to Jolica \"I spent my day on Thursday cleaning the bathroom and kitchen including doing vacuuming.\"\n\nJolica responded with \"Cleaning is important!\"\n\nUgh Jolica's hardly talkative with her responses to my emails. I guess she's lengthy with other people like her sister Juliet Joliet as named. That's interesting guess anyway. Oh well. Ooh so far today I have to show is me eating crummy junk foods than anything healthy like fruits or veggies. Ugh sucks. This stinks. Also I wound up sending emails to people who didn't reply. Only Jolica read my email but chose not to respond. Ugh I hate that status from people who don't respond right away or read my emails right away. Yuck.\n\nYesterday I didn't do much besides eating inappropriate foods and watching boring TV. I also chased the furry kitty for hugs and kisses requests. Cutie refused and avoided me as a result. Ugh. Plus last night around seven o'clock while waiting for mom's phone request time at eight o'clock I started reading this book \"Blood and Boneheads\" by Nikolina Nikolai. I read like two chapters till I saw the time on the clock was seven thirty so I quit reading. Last night I wound up sick in the toilet with a problem that made my head sing a bit including paranoia off a bit. Yuck to have this problem. Ugh cutest cat hung around me as if trying to help me feel better. Aw poor me poor cutest cat.\n\nI phoned mom around eight o'clock \"Hi its Victoria how are you?\"\n\nMom said \"It's really hot in my apartment. I included needing to phone other people when eight thirty rolled around. I wanted to phone my sister.\"\n\nI said \"I nicknamed Auntie Berliner by the name of Myrtle the Turtle for her slow driving in her car.\"\n\nUgh jeez mom for not getting my joke by saying \"That's not funny and quit referring my sister with that reference.\"\n\nAround eight thirty mom got the operator to type the stop keying symbol which we both hung up. I wound up watching HG last night featuring pools than anything amusing. Ugh boring which I could have read more of Nikolai's book but I didn't bother. Ugh.\n\nSunday I spent the day with mom and Auntie Berliner which Mom text emailed me around eight o'clock saying \"Call mom.\"\n\nI obeyed around five minutes later saying \"Hi its Victoria what can I do for you Momsy Bobsy?\"\n\nMom said \"I plan to come to your apartment with my sister there to meet us there.\"\n\n\"I agree to that meeting.\" I said.\n\n\"Love you see you soon.\" said mom who hung up which she arrived to my apartment around eleven o'clock.\n\n\"You're not wearing a bra!\" as blared by Mom in person who noticed I was droopy in the chest area. \"Put on a bra for my sakes!\" I was forced to put on a bra for mom's sakes. Yuck Also mom made me sit around waiting an hour or over that for Auntie Sandy's arrival. Mom tried to call her sister by my cell phone but didn't reach her so she tried her own cell phone and reached the Aunt who arrived around one o'clock. Well Auntie drove mom and I to Bar's Harbor in another state dubbed Massachusetts but Masses by the High Council. Bar's Harbor is where we ate lunch in a restaurant around two o'clock. All I had to show that day was sick with diarrhea from the foods I've eaten. Yuck. Also after the restaurant was to Lance Richard's shrine of mercy where we attended a church mass then left to the shrine's bookstore which is where I wound up sick with a paranoia problem. Hence I glad I had Nikolina Nikolai's book with me. I read that while waiting for the paranoia to blow off which it did. Ugh.\n\nAfter the bookstore was to home where Auntie dropped mom and I off then mom left \"I'm insisting onto a phone call that night at eight o'clock.\"\n\nI wound up eating dinner with my pill the Geodon dosage then after that phoned mom for a phone call. Ugh again. After phone call I watched TV Sunday night then went to bed. Monday I didn't do much besides talking to mom on the phone lengthy then after that I stayed home slobbering after the furry kiddy but she nipped my nose when I tried a kisses fest onto her while holding her. Poor kitty didn't care for the kisses.\n\nAlso I whined to mom by phone \"That cat nipping my nose when I tried to kiss her.\"\n\nMom told me \"I insist you quit doing that hugging and kissing the cat.\" which I said \"I'll try not to doing that behavior.\"\n\nUgh I wound up picking a dog toy and been kissing that stuffed toy instead of kissing the cat. Oh well.\n\nTuesday yesterday I woke up early as seven o'clock by alarm clock which was for phoning mom at eight o'clock \"Hi it's Victoria. You are coming up to see me for a visit?\"\n\nI ranged mom up who said \"I assured you of coming to see you.\"\n\nMom was later as ten o'clock than around the nine o'clock hour. Ugh. I did laundry during waiting for mom which I washed and dried my clothes including my bra then put the clothes in the suitcase into my bedroom which I later put away around six o'clock. Mom arrived around ten o'clock which she on my asking \"Can you drive me to Barnes and Noble's bookstore?\"\n\nMom said \"Nope I refused on using traffic and construction as reasons why I can't drive you. I ran into trouble with the road on the way to your apartment.\"  \nI found this nothing but flimsy excuses. Ugh mom sucks with her excuses. Mom drove me to town library where I found multiple books trashy kind by an author I didn't care for but I'm sure that Jolica would care for those books. Also I found three books by Nikolina Nikolai a go to author for me that I already read and that those books were in a trilogy so I bought them for one dollar and fifty cents. Oh Yay me. Mom drove to Mickayla's in Turin as that town is called by the High Council. Turin is where we had an early lunch then went to target in another plaza.\n\nI tried on bras and a bathing suit mom picky \"I don't want to buy for you.\" or \"I don't want you having to buy them.\"\n\nUgh mom said \"I found the bras' not supporting you right.\"\n\nUgh. After the trying on clothes was grocery shopping at Americaversal where I mostly bought bananas and blueberries then went home.\n\nAt home I turned on the air conditioner \"I want to use your computer.\" Mom said to me.  \nI said \"I allowed you to use my computer internet.\" She proceeded to do that finding what she wanted to find.\n\nShe couldn't find what she wanted so she gave up the computer. Ugh. Also cutesy cat was friendly hanging around me and Mom on the computer. Aw cutest cat was pet able. Aw love that little munchkin but it sucks when I can't hug and kiss her anymore because of her old age have reached her limits involving hugging and kissing. This is a pity anyway.\n\nMom left for home but told me \"I assured you of a phone call around seven o'clock.\"\n\n\"Call mom.\" she wound up texting me around five thirty I noticed five minutes later.\n\nUgh I was on the phone holding in bathroom for two hours till close to eight o'clock is when mom said \"I insisted on getting off the phone. I want to go read a book then go to bed.\"\n\nI hung up willingly on having bathroom urges to go which I went and wound up into my pajamas. I did put cutesy cat onto my lap multiple times whenever she came by me for petting including lap sitting. The lap sitting was just my way of getting a hug from the baby cat onto my lap who sat fine then got off. Aw cute.\n\nAlso I wound up text emailed by Morena in Chat's email who said \"I assures you of Ted's arrival tomorrow around nine o'clock.\"\n\nI'm hoping I can sleep tonight despite sick with the voice attacking me at the moment. Ugh.\n\nMorena's said \"I'm having Ted come pick you up around nine o'clock in the morning.\" I'm hoping I should be able to shake tonight's attack of schizophrenia and sleep but if not I'm going to be up for hours reading a damn book instead. Ugh. I wound up updating my online journal twice. Once on my day's weekend outing and the second entry onto me was being sick at night with a problem. Ugh.\n\nThursday night I was sick with a problem of voice attacking me involving the toiletry problem. Ugh I wound up onto the computer editing one story out of needing something to concentrate onto out of paranoia aggravated including the toilet bothering me. Ugh.\n\nI think somewhere around nine o'clock is when the attack of voice and toilet stopped which I didn't notice that out of typing onto the computer some story ideas.\n\nAfter that I crashed into bed around ten thirty then slept till three o'clock for bathroom on voice's suggestion \"You to get up and use the toilet!\"\n\nUgh voice has been suggesting \"There's something of kidney stones if you hold in your pee urges to waste.\"\n\nYuck. I've been getting up as a result and going to the bathroom and then resuming bed for morning.\n\nAnyway Friday dubbed \"Fry's Day\" by the High Council who insisted \"We insisted on naming that day \"Fry's day.\"\n\nI didn't do much besides saving my work onto disk and then after that I wound up dressing myself into pants that were raggedy and a nice top.\n\nTed when he picked me up for our outing to Morena's house said \"I'm not happy that you're not wearing jeans.\"\n\nUgh jeez Ted sucks when's he's picky onto my clothes. Ugh terrible. I wound up reading around one hundred pages of Nikolina Nikolai's book \"Blood of boneheads\" while in the car ride to Morena's house.\n\nWe arrived to there fine which I asked Morena \"I'm inquiring about your kitties Blackie and Gaia.\"\n\nShe pointed out Blackie sitting onto a chair that sniffed my hand and accepted me petting him. Aw cute. Plus I went to use Morena's bathroom then came out and met Gaia sitting onto the floor that sniffed my hand and accepted me rubbing her belly when she bared that to me. Aw cute like I said. Oh well. Morena drove Ted in passenger seat with me in the back to a mall.\n\nTown's dubbed by the high Council \"We insisted on naming town Dan's Bury.\"\n\nI spent part of the ride reading Nikolai's book because of pee urges \"I got to pee!\" as blared by voice which I heard \"Your not two you should hold it in.\" I'm sure that comment was Merra's voice saying that.\n\nShe's always stuck to my mind and my mind's contents like glue or seemingly commenting from time to time involving what my schizophrenic voice said. Yuck. After we arrived at the mall I finally got to use the bathroom then we took a walk around for a bit before going to the Cake restaurant to eat lunch.\n\nMorena said \"I suggested you try something else than the usual Mickayla's food you habitually eat while with Me.\" which I did.\n\nI tried chicken with pasta which tasted good. Also I had the remainder of Ted's French fries because he couldn't eat the rest of it. Oh well. After lunch was a walk around the mall which I took a look in accessories stores then I tried on jeans in a store that was on sale. I picked three pairs of jeans which I only tried on one and found one fit me fine so I bought that using the seven dollars into my wallet including a debit card for the remainder of the price. Nice! After that was to another store which Morena bought Ted's hats then she bought me three tops I already tried two of them in a store. Nice of Morena.\n\nMom said by phone later \"You owe her a ten dollar gift card including a thank you note.\"\n\nOh well.\n\nMorena got tired so she said \"I insisted we sit down and rest.\" which we did.\n\nI wound up jotting notes into a journal I had in my purse then focused onto Morena on her cell phone. I also wound up playing with my fidget spinner that seemed to be broken a bit but it still worked. At least I'm not playing by my nails. Morena wound up ending the mall's trip which we went to Americaversal's store which there I didn't buy anything and neither did them. We both wandered around.\n\n\"I found a journal I liked to purchase.\" I said but Maureen said \"I insisted on you not to buying that thing out of how plain that notebook was.\"\n\nUgh. After we finished Americaversal's store Morena chatted to someone by phone for twenty minutes while in her car Ted and I sitting quietly. Morena after the phone call was a drive around Newtown which she showed us Sandy Hook's school. After the drive around was to Morena's house where she dropped Ted and I at his car than going inside her house to use the bathroom. Ted let me jot notes by journal in my purse till around six o'clock is when I quit paying attention to where we were going. We arrived to Win's Ville around six fifteen which Ted went to Dublin Donuts to buy coffee and then he took his pills around six twenty five. I got home around six thirty and wound up eating a peanut butter and jelly sandwich with my pills and then attended to my teeth. I phoned mom for an hour long phone call.\n\nAround eight o'clock mom started whining \"I wanting to get off the phone for a work shift tomorrow starting at eight o'clock in the morning twelve hours now.\"\n\nUgh. I hung up and wound up lap sat by the socialized kitty who kept the behavior up out of missing me. I think she was cold from the air conditioner used last night hence her lap happy behavior. Poor kitty! I didn't do much last night instead I watched TV mostly boring HG shows involving a themed house hunting for lottery winners. Ugh I found that boring actually and then around ten o'clock I laid down despite unsure of heartburn. Oh well. I didn't get heartburn during the night but around two o'clock I woke up for bathroom pee urges and then resumed bed till like eight fifteen woken up by daylight. I didn't do much besides sending emails to people and thought I would update my journal entry involving my day yesterday. Oh well.\n\nI woke up around seven o'clock with the voice blaring at me \"Get up time to get up!\"\n\nUgh I woke up but resumed sleeping for ten minutes is when I woke up for good. Also I wound up emailing people this morning before I went to take a shower. Only one friend replied to my emails while others ignored me. I think Morena responded to my email once I was done showering my cell phone indicating her emailing me. Ugh.\n\nMom text emailed me around nine o'clock our regular phone time in the morning me to \"Call at ten mom.\"\n\nI did that phoning which mom was whining \"I'm having a splitting sinus headache and not feeling good.\"\n\nThis is a pity anyway.\n\nMom ended call ten minutes later whining \"I want to go lie down and sleep off this splitting headache. Love you Vicky bye.\"\n\nThe operator said \"Person hung up GA or SK?\"\n\n\"Thanks SK.\" I said and I hung up.\n\nFor the records I hate the nickname of Vicky for my name of Victoria. I always hated the joke of sticky Vicky used onto me by bullies teasing me in middle school which only Mavis Petersen was my friend. I'm still annoyed that the bullies got my friends females I considered friends to dump me and call me sticky Vicky instead of the name of Victoria. I still haven't forgiven those bullies for that for my friends wound up having sexual relationships with the males and females' bullies in high school to my disgust. Yuck.\n\nTed wound up texting me around ten thirty \"I'm coming around eleven o'clock for a kitchen cleaning.\"\n\nUgh sucks.\n\n\"I'm here.\" I text emailed to Ted my response.\n\nTed arrived around eleven o'clock my cat on my lap indicating that arrival by getting off and running elsewhere. Poor baby cute kitten.\n\nTed cleaned my kitchen and said \"This is the dirtiest kitchen I ever cleaned.\"\n\nUgh not really quoting Ted but guessing on what he said. Oh well.\n\n\"You're a piglet what a piglet involving not cleaning the kitchen.\" I got from the voice followed by Merra's snickering laughter sounding into my mind like she told a joke for me to hear \"Sticky Vicky is a piglet with the kitchen!\"\n\nJeez Merra.\n\nAfter kitchen cleaning which ended around one thirty Ted said \"I have to go home to eat lunch.\"\n\nI did tell Ted \"I was planning on nuking French fries.\" but once he left I turned out to be a liar and nuked some bagels I ate with butter onto them.\n\n\"Liar, liar you lied to Ted!\" said voice ugh me and my eating habits.\n\nUgh dad text emailed me ten minutes to eleven o'clock saying \"At Sanne's. Called doctor to reschedule didn't hear back.\"\n\nUgh my doctor's appointment for tomorrow is being cancelled by dad being at Sanne's giving her health a priority over my health. He sucks with his priorities. Ugh.\n\nAlso once Ted left I text emailed dad saying \"Hi dad. How's Sanne doing? I've cleaned kitchen with friend's help. I'm eating lunch at home stormy weather outside.\"\n\nDad text emailed his response saying \"Raining here meeting Sanne at two thirty afternoon.\"\n\nUgh not really quoting dad and myself but taking poetic license with what we both said. Oh well.\n\nI wound up sick in the toilet with problems today hence I unable to do much besides suffering from number two's problems including voice attacking me at the time.\n\n\"Are you forgetting something forgetting some paranoid feeling!\" sang voice.\n\nAlso the handyman finally arrived with a shower stall handle which was good. I was able to shower around five thirty which I was sick in the toilet again multiple times. I tried to ring mom around six o'clock but her line was purposely busy and she refused to being picked up the damn phone. Damn mom for this phone games done onto me tonight. Ugh.\n\nI did text email mom around five forty five \"Its Victoria its six o'clock at home awaiting word phone wise tonight by weather so text email me mews.\"\n\nMom ignored my plea for a phone texting mews message ASAP. Ugh mom sucks big time when's she's does this joke onto me even when's I'm sick with the voice going off scaring me. Jeez mom!\n\nI feel like I said the wrong thing in my emails to people hence their balking responding to my messages. Ugh this is the pits big time when's I expects responses to my emails but get ignorance. Jeez people are terrible with their communications. Ugh. Jolica seemed to have given up responding to my emails. All she does is read my messages and refused to respond. Ugh I felt like something I've said turned her off from responding to my mews. Ugh sucks. This is the same attitude from Mavis too. I email Mavis but he won't be responding for he reads my messages. Ugh again. I had a weird dream involving a talk show host playing match maker with straight couples which she did that to me with a guy. Oh she's a lesbian and not straight so I doubt that she would do match making status. Ugh. Also that dream involved some Halloween room which I was to walk through while peering through my eyes covered by my hands. Ugh I don't get the dream involving that scary status. Yuck. I woke up around eight o'clock with dizziness and decided to get up anyway. Oh I think that dizziness involved me either tired or maybe jet lagged from my sleep of ten o'clock to eight o'clock. Ugh this stinks. Last night after a thirty minute phone call with mom I emailed Morena who read my message around nine forty in the evening but didn't respond. I emailed Jolica who read my lengthy email like I said but didn't respond. Ugh. I'm bored and rather depressed out of unable to do anything productive today.\n\n\"I wound up this morning throwing out some junk that was collecting dust into my apartment.\" I said to Morena who said \"I praised you with that throwing out of junk. Ted complained to me that your apartment is cluttered.\"\n\nI was talking to Morena from ten o'clock to twelve thirty is when she said \"I have to end chat to go eat lunch.\"\n\nI wound up telling Morena \"I'm having an area in my apartment to sort.\"\n\nI showed her a picture of items to toss out.\n\nMorena said \"I praised you like I said already. I seemed proud.\"\n\nOh nice.\n\nMorena has said \"I've been critical of your eating habits. I like you to eat something else than what you've been eating lately.\"  \n\"I've been eating heavily onto tots and French fries alone than with anything else to eat.\" I said in response to her question \"What are you going to cook for lunch?\" which I said my answer \"Tots and French fries.\"\n\nMorena said \"I find both foods inappropriate for you to eat alone. I insist you eat with veggies or fruits.\"\n\n\"Ugh I haven't been in the mood for veggies and fruits. I've been eating foods on what I'm craving to eat than eating anything decently healthy like veggies and fruits.\" I said.\n\n\"Ugh you should eat something healthy than that junk.\" Morena said.\n\nI meant to go eat those nuked veggie meals but I was craving bagels with butter on them for lunch than veggies. Ugh hence I eating two bagels with butter spread onto them including cupcakes and orange juice than anything else to eat. Ugh this sucks.\n\nAlso Jolica finally responded to my emails \"I love to eat food from Americaversal's store.\"\n\nHer email was short about food than anything else. I ugh felt like one email said something wrong that insulted Jolica to not respond.\n\nUgh hence I sent her another email last night \"I love to eat tots and French fries something that Morena my friend is insisting I not eat.\" which she replied this morning \"I love to eat food from Americaversal's store as my snack from work.\"\n\nI wound up with cravings for French fries but I didn't bother eating that tonight. I was sick in the toilet multiple times as a result that killed my appetite for French fries despite craving the food. Ugh. I realized I should have eaten fruits instead of heavily starch food like tots and French fries so I skipped that tonight for dinner. I had a plastic tin of strawberries and blueberries which I piglet onto than eating anything else. Ugh again. Also around the one o'clock hour I had some chocolate candy out of craving to eat them. Ugh that's the last time I'm eating that crappy junk food because I always wound up sick in the toilet with problems like thirty minutes later after eating that food. Ugh.\n\n\"I noticed I seemed to be lactose intolerant.\" something Morena said \"You seemed to be lactose intolerant. I insist you try to eat something else than a diet focused onto dairy products.\"\n\nUgh terrible big time when's my dairy diet of foods had me ballooned up to one eighty six pounds in weight hence I've been on my new diet of dairy less foods and drinks for around two years so far. So far I've lost weight around twenty pounds I think from my new diet. I seemed to be focusing onto lesser dairy products and trying to focus onto water to drink for my primary drinks. I do tend to drink something else than water if I'm not paying for my meals at a restaurant. I order water if I'm paying for myself. Ugh. Also I managed to try drinking orange juice instead of dairy drinks for calcium's needs for my bones. I'm trying lactose intolerant drinks like milk that's supposedly be friendly for the lactose intolerant. Ugh the milk I drink I bought from the grocery store tastes weird to me but I'm hoping to continue drinking that occasionally including the orange juice. Ugh again.\n\nI wound up sick in the toilet multiple times tonight hence I had a noisy head when I went to phone mom around seven o'clock \"Are you forgetting something forgetting some?\" sang voice \"Your always forgetful.\" I heard sounding of Merra.\n\nI talked to mom till like seven thirty is when she said \"I insisted on getting off the phone.\"\n\nI said \"I agreed on bathroom hitting me at the time for I have to go to the bathroom.\"  \nMom said \"Love you Vicky.\"\n\nShe hung up according to operator which I said \"Thanks.\"\n\nI hung up and hit the toilet with the voice blaring \"Forgetting some!\"\n\nI didn't do much once I got off the phone but went onto the computer to send Morena an email who was online but apparently onto her cell phone hence she not responding right away after I emailed her. Ugh sucks.\n\nI emailed Jolica \"I'm whining of my foods' habits including toiletry problems soon after I eat my dairy products food.\"\n\nI tried to be not so descriptive.\n\nUgh Jolica responded right away with \"Your diet needed adjusting.\"\n\nOh well. Jolica's like me involving the food and diet eating. She's tries to exercise and lose weight including watching what's she's eating too. I'm trying that behavior myself but the exercising haven't been much and same for my eating foods. Ugh.\n\nMom yesterday worked a weird afternoon work shift of two forty five to six forty five on her damn day off.\n\nThis sucks when mom was texting me twice in the morning for a talk on the phone \"Call mom!\"\n\nThe talks on the phone weren't much just ten minutes of babbling then hanging up and doing something else. Ugh. Also I wound up fooling around onto the computer out of needing something to do. I spent two hours computer staring till noon is when I quit to go eat lunch and focused onto the junk on TV like HG. Ugh. Anyway I was itching to type something but I couldn't seem to get into the mood to type anything besides search engine's queries. Ugh. I used a search engine to find the address of an author Nikolina Nikolai I favored involving her works.\n\nI was hoping to mail one of her books to Miss Nikolai to sign for me \"Hi can you sign this book to Victoria?\"\n\nI'm not entirely sure of that book's signage being done. I like to collect books of authors that are signed like autographed. Ugh hence I want one signed to me with my name and autographed like those Nikolina Nikolai's books I ordered awhile ago. Oh well again. I have four Nikolina Nikolai's books autographed which two are addressed to me.\n\n\"To Victoria good luck with everything you do writing wise love Nika.\" with commentary included with them.\n\nI'm hoping on getting another book autographed to me from Nika as she refers herself once the book comes out in November or late that month. Ugh. Anyway I wound up with a weird dream involving me working at a fast food joint restaurant while wearing some kind of hearing aid pack that broke hence I having to leave the job and go home. Also during that home's leaving I met Mavis from school who currently lives in the west coast in the state referred as Western Coast by the High Council.\n\nI met Mavis who drove me to an apartment building despite me having suitcases which he said \"I'm complaining of the stairs hurting my knees.\"\n\nOh we stopped by some amusement room for kids to sit around resting from walking around.\n\nI'm not sure of what to make of that room \"I wanted to play with the games.\" I said.\n\nMavis said \"I don't feel like playing games.\" so I went with him elsewhere.\n\nOh that's when's I woke up to \"Spoilsport you ruin my fun!\" talk by Merra.\n\nI'm not entirely sure of what to make of this weird dream anyway. I don't get the contents at all. I don't remember this being a memory or not. Oh well. I sometimes have weird dreams of memories that pop into my mind occasionally. I don't think that weird dream I had was a memory. I'm not sure if I remember this anyway. Oh crummy to not remember. Ugh.\n\nLast night around five thirty, I emailed Morena \"Hi Morena what's mew with you meow?\"\n\nMorena was online Chat's at the time \"Howdy Vika.\"\n\nWe chatted talking about stuff till nine o'clock is when Morena said \"I have to end chat to go do some personal hygiene stuff.\"\n\nAround nine o'clock I ranged mom up \"Hi Momsy how are you?\"\n\n\"I'm tired of tiredness.\" Also mom whined \"You needing to go take your pill at ten o'clock.\"\n\nI sort of fibbed or lied when I told her \"I took that pill already around nine o'clock.\" when I haven't \"Liar you lied to mom.\" Said voice which added \"Vicky you shouldn't lie to people it's not proper.\" Like Merra eavesdropped onto my mind and commented that.\n\nUgh.\n\nMom around ten o'clock said \"I'm insisted on getting off the phone.\" which I said \"I agreed bye mom.\"\n\nI hung up and wound up taking my pill for real and lying down into bed. Ugh again. Also I slept with the windows shut all night which in the morning I woke up around seven o'clock and decided to open the window airing out the stink into here. The air into my apartment was stuffy and smelly Eli of the cat's litter box including the toilet unable to be flushed. Ugh.\n\nI used to flush the toilet at all hours of the night after ten o'clock but downstairs' neighbor ranged my doorbell around midnight with a note \"I'm complaining of your noisy toilet too loud for my TV and keeping me up awake than sleeping.\"\n\nUgh hence I gave up flushing the toilet after ten o'clock at night even whenever I'm sick with those bathroom number two's voiced problems. Ugh.\n\nMorena said \"I find those all nights of you sick with voice and bathroom number two is your body's way of getting rid of something within you. I find this good but I booed that you was up all night with this problem hence you unable to sleep.\"\n\nUgh a pity anyway.\n\n\"Cool beans enjoy your reading.\" Jolica said in response to my lengthy paragraphed email to her in Chat's talking \"I got a signed book by Nikolina Nikolai the author autographed to me Victoria Yay me!\"\n\nI emailed Jolica \"My day yesterday was a visit to the town library which including the books I was reading and checked out by Nikolina Nikolai.\" hence Jolica's short response. Ugh. Jolica's hardly lengthy with her emailing responses to my wordy emails. Oh well this stinks big time when's I suspects she's lengthy with someone else but not so lengthy with me. I ugh blame Jolica's sister Juliet for being whose Jolica is lengthy with while short with me. Ugh again.\n\nI wound up nuking some veggies that came in garlic sauce in the microwave which I ate most of that but didn't have the whole bowl. I threw the rest of the bowl's contents into the trash and didn't eat the rest of the crumbs. Oh well. Also I have chocolate chip cookies I managed to put into my refrigerator after sitting into my kitchen cupboard ignored for awhile. I figured that putting the cookies into the refrigerator would be better for them to be preserved than sitting into the cupboard getting bad and badly decomposed. Yuck.\n\n\"It's Victoria its six o'clock home awaiting word phone wise tonight so text me mews ASAP.\" This is my message to mom's cell phone which I'm not sure if she'll pick up the phone at six o'clock or not.\n\nOh well.\n\nI sent Morena an email \"I'm telling you I'm fine for now.\" That despite I sick with the bathroom problem despite I should have said something but I didn't bother in response to her question \"Are you alright with the bathroom and voice?\"\n\nOh well. Also I emailed Tommy I nicknamed my Tom after awhile of not emailing him. He's not responding to my emails in awhile like I expected him to do. His communications needs work actually. Ugh.\n\nI emailed Jolica \"I'm reading books involving what I cared to read book wise involving both paper and electronic.\"\n\nOh she replied as soon as possible like she was online expecting my messages \"Well that's nice to read.\"\n\nMy week in a nutshell was Monday I didn't do anything besides staying home piglet eating food and slobbering after the furry bundle of fur with kisses and hugs' fests. Aw. \"Monday I'm to come to clean the bathroom.\" but he didn't \"Sorry Victoria I have to go see a doctor on health issues.\" according to his text email.\n\nUgh hence the bathroom isn't cleaned yet but I meant to go clean the toilet. Ugh. Tuesday was day of the schizophrenic's club meeting and laundry day for me. I washed and dried my clothes then after that attended the club meeting.\n\n\"The meeting will be about posters for Harlow's party next month.\"\n\nThis'll be great fun attending to the party.\n\n\"Oh well great for you Vicky.\" Merra said while blaring into my mind which got the voice blaring \"You're going. You're not going.\"\n\nAlso Morena after interpreting a deaf club member said to me \"I reminded you of an author Janna Japan visiting the school that Tuesday night doing a presentation onto her book.\" which I said \"I agreed to go.\"\n\nTed on my asking \"Can you drive me home? Can you pick me up for the author's presentation?\" Ted said \"Yes I'll drive you home and yes I'll pick you up at six o'clock for the presentation.\"\n\nI had dinner that was bread and strawberries but I wound up sick in the toilet with problems involving number two that got my head singing loudly \"Forgetting some! You're not going your going!\"\n\nYuck. The loud singing creep me out enough to trigger my paranoia off. Ted picked me up around six thirty.\n\n\"I've arrived!\" Ted text emailed me despite me not peeking out the window for him.\n\nUgh terribly rude of me despite he told me in the car \"Next time watch for me.\"\n\nAnyway Ted drove me to the school and found a parking spot easily which I went to the auditorium and spent most of that time reading Nikolina Nikolai's book \"Graces\" than paying attention to the author's presentation. Ugh rude of me. I was sick with the voice going off at the time hence I creep out unable to pay attention to Morena's interpreted signing including paying attention to the author's presentation. Ugh sucks hence I read Nikolai's book as a result.\n\nAnyway the presentation ended which I asked Morena \"How much does Janna charge for autographing her book to myself?\"\n\nI only had ten dollars worth of change money into my wallet.\n\nMorena rolled her eyes a pleasure like look from High Council despite a Human gesture of annoyance disgust and gave me twenty dollars \"You to use the money to pay for that author's book for autographed and signed but you owe me money for it.\"\n\nNice of Morena but I owe her twenty dollars for that book. Oh well.\n\nI got home around eight thirty.\n\nI ranged mom up by phone \"Hi Mom its Victoria. I apologized for not calling you at eight o'clock as you expected me to do.\" instead told mom \"Janna Japan the author did a presentation at the school as invited by Morena.\"\n\nI said nothing involving me sick in the toilet with problems involving voice to mom by phone.\n\nMom understood I whined of this problem once \"I'm sick with a voiced attack and can't talk to you now.\"  \nShe said \"I'll talk to you later tomorrow and hope you'll feel better.\"  \nI hung up saying \"Love you thanks.\"\n\nThe voice once I was off the phone with mom insisted \"Text your dad!\"\n\nThe voice habitually says that saying \"Text your dad!\" said that saying while I sick with the attack of voice involving the toilet's number two.\n\nI gave up texting dad as a result of those voiced attacks \"Dad I'm sick with a voiced attack tonight.\"\n\nDad said in response \"Go watch TV and just ignore the noises.\"\n\nI don't text dad whenever I'm sick with those voiced attacks. I just ignore the voice's orders and wound up sitting reading a book while having the TV on blaring crap. Sometimes I type onto the computer stories or editing one story out of needing something to do to concentrate onto. Ugh the voiced attack involving bathroom quit around midnight but I didn't get to bed till one o'clock is when I finished viewing a TV show on HG channel then I crashed and slept fine till like eight o'clock is when I woke up and started my day. Ugh. Also Wednesday yesterday I didn't do much besides kisses to the kitty then around eleven o'clock roped dad into driving me around for in town errands which he gave me a time of two o'clock during the Kelly Keller show. Ugh again to missing that show. I went to town library driven by dad around two o'clock which at library I dropped off two library books. One was Nikolina Nikolai's \"Graces\" I rate four stars online. The other book was something involving a High Council member seeking a romance like relationship that bothered me despite not reading that book. The romance with Tom put together by the High Council is what I blame for causing me to have a voice attacking me like triggering the voice to pick onto me. I blame this situation hence I refused to read books involving the High Council. Yuck I refused to acknowledge that I was born with this problem despite I blame my servitude with the High Council paired to Tommy is why I have a schizophrenic like voiced problem. Ugh. Anyway I picked up six books for four dollars and fifty cents.\n\n\"How much are those two books that were sitting onto your desk?\" I asked which the librarian said \"I was confused to why they were there but give me twenty five cents for them both.\"\n\nI obeyed which I picked up those two books then after that I went to Druggie as the High Council refer that drug store for pill refills \"Call that store Druggie as insisted.\" blared Merra.\n\nI at Druggie asked \"Is my pills need any refilling?\"\n\nThe pharmacist said \"No on refilling your pills.\" according to the pharmacist \"You was caught up.\" so I left the pharmacy store.\n\nVoice picked onto me while I was leaving saying \"Are you forgetting something?\"\n\nVoice led me to believe there was something I forgot to pick up from the pharmacy store I couldn't remember as a result.\n\nUgh sucks. Anyway I went grocery shopping which dad stayed into the car. I pulled out some money then used half of that to pay for some personal cleaning supplies like paper towels and toilet tissues. Nice I guess. Anyway once I was home I put everything away and then wound up throwing out the garbage. Ugh the dumpster was emptied out as a result. Oh nice. After dumpster was watching Dellen's show then local news till four thirty is when I went to HG because they were showing a press conference involving donkey turnip the idiotic king in the leadership position I don't care to watch. I don't care to watch donkey turnip shoot himself into the foot with his words have people criticized his wordings. Anyway around six o'clock I watched the sports report that aired around six thirty then I went to HG till seven o'clock is when I ranged mom up who ignored me. Mom wound up texting me \"You to call me back at seven thirty.\" which I skipped TV five minutes to that time and wound up journaling.\n\nI talked to mom for forty five minutes by phone from seven thirty to eight fifteen. Mom wasn't too chatty on the phone with me. She only was saying one to three words at a time and hardly anything else. Ugh jeez mom must be tired hence her lack of conversation mood hence she ended called around eight fifteen. I wound up watching the twins Chip and Dip brothers' show till ten o'clock is when HG went into boring house hunting themed show I didn't care for so I skipped that for bed and slept somewhat badly. Cute baby kitten was a pesky pest during my attempts to sleep. The cat was pawing my face and demanding attention from me she kept it up during my attempts to sleep. Dumb cat dumb animal quit that around three o'clock which I got up and hit the toilet then slept undisturbed till around eight o'clock is when I woke up. Ugh. Also I wound up emailing people which only Auntie Berliner replied to my email. Jolica read my second email but didn't bother replying. Ugh. Morena was emailed but she wasn't online to read my message hence her not replying and reading my message. Ugh.\n\nI wound up sick in the toilet with problems involving number two that made my head sing as a result. Yuck. I'm not sure of what I'm doing tonight other than talking to mom by phone when's it's time around seven o'clock like she asked me to do by cell phone texting message.\n\nI talked to mom for forty five minutes last night till seven forty five is when she said \"I asked to get off the phone because of working an early morning work shift Thursday morning at seven o'clock.\"\n\n\"Are you forgetting something forgetting some?\" sang voice which I said to mom by phone \"I agreed to get off.\" out of creepy out by the voice picking onto me at the time.\n\nAlso I wound up onto the computer editing one story to be told from third person he's point of view to me first person I point of view. Well nice that I did that including finished that story around ten o'clock is when I went to take my bedtime pill. Ugh.\n\nI wound up too creepy out with the computer so I went to the TV watching it while reading a library book by Charisma Chic. She's a new to me author I haven't read before hence I trying out her book. I rate Charisma's book around three stars out of five online but I'm not sure of what rating I'll give that book into my lists onto the computer. Ugh.\n\nI rate from anywhere from one star to ten stars depending onto my mood involving a book I read and finish I list onto my computer lists. Well Yay me for doing that listing anyway. Oh well. Also Charisma's book was a library book due within a week's time frame on Tuesday next week hence I stayed up reading and finishing that library book even while creepy out by the paranoia and the voice's talk. Ugh. I wound up emailed by the town library of a library book \"Blue pill\" by Nikolina Nikolai due within a week's time frame. I started that early this morning out of unable to sleep with the voice going off including paranoia. Yuck. I found Charisma's book had some vulgarity languages and sexual terms into that book's contents I didn't care for hence I rating that book three stars out of five online. I'll probably rate that book a low rating while into my lists onto the computer. Ugh sucks. \"Blue Pill\" is a medieval like teens book that's a part of Nikolai's Graces' series I already invested time reading her current books out. One is called Graces which other is called \"Blue Graces\" Their supposedly be stand by alones novels but I don't know what to make of the books. \"Graces\" I found rather interesting I'll rate it an eight into my book lists but rated the book a four online. Oh goody. Also \"Blue Graces\" was rather interesting enough to give the same rating involving my books' lists including online too. Nice! I rate Charisma's book a four onto my list onto the computer out of the vulgarity and sexual innuendo terms into that book I didn't care for at all. Yuck. I didn't care for the vulgarity languages of rhyming with duck and the word it too something the High Council frowns upon. They hate those words said into their presence and have asked Meritanians to dump whoever said those words in front of them to be dumped into the ocean. I didn't care for some of the sexual terms mentioned into that book including how sexy the author tried to make that book be. This turned me off and made me rate the book low as four stars.\n\nI wound up emailed by the High Council saying \"Please correct for mistakes involving grammar and stuff.\"\n\nI opened file and discovered according to the High Council's body \"An Entry into Edenia series told in letters of a character named Victoria Montreal.\"\n\nI was a little annoyed to get this email but kept on reading more of the file out of curiosity. File said Victoria Montreal is me aka creator of the Veronica Thomas Incorporation Publication for writing skills including me thinking of writing stories. I still type by laptop computer occasionally for the High Council's orders but that's lately for typing memories as they requested. Is it just me or is my life boring as usual? I find that my life is a bit boring. I don't know why. I think I'm bored with the same old thing, get up at a certain time and go to school. I'm getting a little sick of school lately. I just feel bored with school.\n\nI think I'm getting a case of \"I'm fed up with college\" bits again.\n\nI have a love hate relationship with college at University of Long River Place where I take online courses out of the High Council telling me in person by speaker Shad \"You Victoria Montreal is an original and not a clone by your colored blood of red color. You are ordered to remain isolated at Jinks Montreal's residence with Dalton the titled holder as he wishes to call himself.\"\n\nThis was done which I'm at Jinks Montreal's residence staying into his guest room as his well known daughter or offspring despite a cloned copy sent to be raised by Jinks aka Horus himself. I'm not entirely sure of what to make of this cloned copy being raised by Horus himself despite recalling that Victoria or a cloned copy was later sent to her brother's Robert Montreal to be raised further till adulthood. I'm not sure of what happened to Robert Montreal once I figured was fully grown. I know that Robert is an original and not a clone which I suspect that's he's sent to the Zesky Asylum to be contained into a tube for being an original. I think this is what originals of people are sent to tubes to be contained and sickened memories of cloned copies by the Meritanians thinking funny.\n\nI'm not spared of the Meritanians playing \"Sick the clones with memories of originals.\" Joke as a result despite I still get those memories occasionally to type them down.\n\nI liked college but now I want to quit for good. I've been going to college on and off since I reached the declared age of choice which is nineteen years old. I'm tired of wasting my money for classes that I'll only flunk or audit. I'm currently at the age of thirty years old despite looking like I haven't aged into my facial appearance. I'm not sure if I've aged or not or the High Council is making originals have some not aged appearance status to mark them.\n\nI'm taking this class called \"Women in Literature.\"\n\nThe teacher told me \"See me after class.\"\n\nI saw the teacher April Maple which brought jokes by students out of her earshot \"April gets your maple.\"\n\nI'm sure that April is a cloned copies of an original hence her rhyming name \"April Maple.\"\n\nMiss Maple I called her than calling her \"Professor\" told me \"You should audit the class to keep your student grades in standing.\"\n\nI said in response \"I'm not sure of that status but what does the school counselor Mister Dinnen says?\"\n\nMister Dinnen is a cloned copy of a Builder male who according to the files of the High Council \"Dinnen was power mad to be in a leadership position and doing anything to kick people out of that title to achieve it himself.\"\n\n\"I went to the school counselor to discuss this and the school counselor agreed with me so you're to audit the class.\" As said by Miss Maple as her answer.\n\nI asked her \"What about the homework assignments and term papers?\"\n\nMiss Maple said in response \"You auditing the class won't have to do the homework or term papers. Just show up for your attendance is mandatory as part of the auditing requirements. You still have to do the reading reactions homework assignment as I insisted on you to do. That's all I have to say so leave.\"\n\nMiss Maple gave me a golden eyed glare of a Builder I shocked to get that look from her despite unsure if she was actually a Builder clone. Oh well I left the classroom taking the driver a Highlander driving me to Jinks Montreal's residence building where the vehicle got inside by garage. I didn't do anything homework assignment wise once I was safety into my bedroom or Jinks Montreal's guest bedroom of his penthouse apartment that's somewhere in the middle of the building and blocked heavily from being seen outside it without any porches. Oh well. I'm just relieved that I won't have to do the term papers at all but I do have to do the reading reactions too. Ugh, I was hoping to get out of doing some work in that class. So I'm not sure what else I could do for college.\n\nI wound up text by Mavis saying \"You should see what other classes the college offers you.\"\n\nMavis is a Builder clone of someone else that's related to me and seen as a cousin despite a Builder himself who has some inner ability to see what I'm doing as always. He's tries to be discreet with his ability to avoid spying onto me but sometimes he can't help himself hence his text by cell phone to my cellular communication.\n\nDalton insisted \"No phone calls within the residence but texting only. I don't want to hear playback of people's conversations as recorded by the High Council in their presence.\"\n\nI obeyed to text to Mavis \"Nothing I can do involving college but quit being bored of it.\"\n\nMavis said in response \"My Mother raiser wants me to go a University in the state but this University costs about eight hundred dollars per class money which I don't have at the moment. I have to get a job for this just to earn for some college class.\"\n\nI wound up saying in response \"I would rather do something else instead like read a book. I brought some books this weekend-\"\n\nMavis interrupted \"I saw that you bought one on how to write a novel which you'll have to study really good because I want you to write my memoir book someday. I have to go to class talk to you later.\"  \nThat ended the conversation which I was going to say \"I finished a story I think. I really would have to find an agent to make a career of writing for a living. I don't know how these authors in the world can write books and get their books published.\"  \nI'm still trying to find out how people can get their stories published into books and things keep conspiring against me.\n\nI'm trying to ask people like my college professor April Maple \"How do you publish your work into writing form?\" and she said as always \"Find out yourself.\"\n\nThose people always seem not very helpful at all.\n\nI also keep trying to find someone like Mavis or Dalton \"Can you give me feedback on that story?\" but Mavis said \"I'm too busy to help.\"\n\nDalton as insisted by that titled name than dad said \"I'm not the person for you to get help with.\"\n\nI find their excuses make me think their either been lazy or way too busy to help. Humph, I'm not happy with that at all.  \nI've talked to people in class before the teacher arrives saying \"I hope to write stories and become a published author.\"\n\nThat people in class are mostly females hardly any males despite unsure if the title of women into the class is what turned males off from taking the class.\n\nI know there's a \"Men in Literature\" class but I haven't taken it on Miss Maple telling me \"Just don't take that class it's for males only.\"\n\nAnyway the females in class I've talked to have been very negative in response \"You'll do terrible in book sales if you ever get your story published.\"\n\nI hate it when people are negative about that. I like to write a story and publish it for people to read because I want to do that and earn some good cents too. I like to earn some money for a better living and if I have to do this by writing stories well I'll do that then even if I have to find out what I can do involving this situation using the internet.\n\nI figured I'll refer my journal entries to either you or to someone who I felt like writing to. I finished a book last night that is a self help book. I think I'll lend the book to you to read to encourage reading. I liked that self help book but the contents were a little girlish and strange. I think the book is geared towards women mostly. I'm not sure but the book's contents sure felt that way. The author is a woman Verona Vander who is a famous actress who wrote that book. I gave up reading a science fiction book by Terrific Terri as the author calls himself because I was feeling bored or depressed by the contents. I felt like I couldn't read that book anymore. So I set the book aside. That book I put aside is one of several books by Terrific Terri the author I didn't finish but will try to finish later. It's my second time reading that book by Terrific Terri. I'm feeling like I should have tried to finish that book but didn't. I also am not pleased that this book is part of a trilogy. I guess I'll have to read more of that author's books just to finish the series. I picked a book by Sharene Vander daughter of Verona Vander herself a book which I'm currently reading. I'm thinking of using that book as a bedtime book but the contents of the book are questionable for me to read before bed. The book is actually an adult fiction book. I say questionable because the contents are Sharene's stab at writing some children's stories in adult fiction. I'm hesitant to read that book before bed because of the contents of the book might disturb me well enough to keep me awake. I did read books by the Vander Incorporation before. I got the idea that I read the books by Vander family by the Meritanians compelling me to read those books. I guess I'll try my best to enjoy reading that book and will try to read book two of the second book once I finished this book one. Anyway I was lent two books I'm not even sure I'll get around to reading them. I'm not sure what to say to Morena who lent me those books. I felt like I had to take the books and read them. I figured I could always hold onto them for awhile and then give them back. Morena is a good friend who I haven't learned to say no to because I'm worried about hurting her feelings. I really should be up front from time to time on this. I'm disappointed that I haven't gotten to that point with Morena Latina as she's known by the name.\n\nI have to complain that I'm a spender of money.\n\nI keep writing to myself \"You to save money.\"\n\nI am reminding myself to not spend my money. I feel like I compulsively spend money on things that are junk. It's like an addiction that I can't control. I mostly spend money on books and food. The food is from school I nickname the local college I go to for classes and other places such as restaurants too. I have a lunch box which I should be toting along with some drink bottle too. I really should be using the lunch box and drink bottle for school instead of spending money on food. I also hate it when I buy books that some turn out to be really bad enough for me to set aside or lose interest.\n\nMorena has said \"I insist you to get books from the library.\" after I complain to her \"Those books I bought are horrible despite reading them and a waste of my money.\"\n\nI really hate having to read books under a deadline. I just hate having to do that deadline thing for book reading. I don't like deadlines but maybe I should try it sometime instead of buying books. I figured I should try the library and see if I like the book. I have about several books set aside that turn out to be lousy because I couldn't get into them or finish them. I'm feeling like I should really try to check out books from the library instead of buying them. I think I compulsively spend money without thinking. I also don't think I have buyers' remorse but I'm not sure if I really do have that. I think I do suffer from that sometimes but buyers' remorse doesn't stick around long enough to affect me very much. This has me spending tons of money when I should be saving my money. I really would like it if I could save my money instead of spending it compulsively. I had it with the compulsive spending. I ought to save my money instead of spending it. I feel like I'm all talk and no action. I talk about saving money and I won't save it but I would wound up spending the money instead, ugh.\n\nWith what happened at a college in Albany? I swear you High Council, keeps on making people inspired to commit acts of terror like getting a gun and shooting people in classes in your name. I'm not happy with the news lately involving people acting as Annoyovs as you call the people who act in terrorist acts in your name without you ordering them.\n\nThe school's officials by news keep talking into conversation during their broadcasts \"The school failed to go into lockdown two hours after the shooter shot some people.\"\n\nI feel like the school should have gone into lockdown after they found out the shooting. I'm also not happy with Albany College as that school is called not doing any apologizing towards you the High Council group for that inspired Annoyov behavior. I think the officials at Albany College should be fired for failing to do that safety behavior and apologizing. I also think some senseless deaths would have been prevented as a result of immediate lock down. I feel bad that the shooter is giving Annoyovs a bad name despite I know of a famous Annoyov servant of yours Tom Thunder himself. I'm wondering what happened to him nowadays? As I was saying I wouldn't be surprised if there would be anger towards famous Annoyovs because of what happened at Albany College. I'm hoping that I'm wrong about this anger feeling towards Annoyovs.\n\nThe news wound up saying \"This event will probably be known in history as a smear campaign against Annoyovs.\"\n\nI'm not happy that the famous Annoyovs known to do things into your name in peaceful ways will be hit with terrorist acts because of what I'm seeing on the news.\n\nThe news said \"We talking about this being one of the most deadly shootings in history.\"\n\nMakes me wonder what are they talking about? What about the Millennium tragedy where a continent piece of the United States was transferred from Planet Terra to Shadan or the planetary world as it's known Aire? Isn't that transfer a deadly history moment where many thousand people died? I think I'm confused here because I'm not so sure what I'm talking about. I'm disgusted that the school I go to have old men who are security guys. I think the school I'm in needs undercover people and some emergency phones. It's about time that they set up this security measure anyway. I also wonder about the college Morena herself works part time at Long River College in the State of Long River Place. I can't help worrying about some things that'll happen to be quite bad to Morena while she's at work. I'm not happy about what happened to colleges in the name of the High Council because I'm disgusted this happened. Ugh\n\nI did some sorting at your wife's house. I sorted through the junk in the attic parts of the house. The house that's willed to you by Samira Montreal your lovely wife has some attic spaces for my stuff to keep and store. I'm glad that I did some sorting today except I'm hoping that I won't have remorse for getting rid of some stuff I took out for the goodwill. This wore me out but it's good to be worn out to do this chore.\n\nA cloned copy of you I refer as Dad occasionally has told me \"You to do the chore of sorting because we both have too much junk at my house.\"\n\nI'm glad I was able to do several boxes of stuff for this. The job is still not finished. I have to do more sorting at the other attic spaces too. I guess it'll be worth the sorting to give to the goodwill. I like to give to the goodwill sometimes. I hate it when I get remorse for getting rid of some stuff. There were some clothes I decided to get rid of but I'm feeling a little remorse for deciding that. Maybe I'll feel better later and also I sometimes feel funny getting rid of some books too. I sometimes get rid of books I don't want to read or keep anymore. This gives me a weird feeling which bothers me sometimes. I hate that feeling because it makes me feeling like I'm guilty to get rid of a book. I managed to get over the feeling of getting rid of a book sometimes. It's nice to give things away to the goodwill for people to use.\n\nThis is like the saying \"One person's trash is another person's treasure.\"\n\nI think people should try to give things to the goodwill instead of trashing them in the trash. I've seen things in the trash on curbs which makes me wonder why they give to the goodwill instead of trashing them. I'm not happy about that. This makes me disgusted and upset about the people leaving things for the trash. The trash really needs to be sorted and cleaned out for more land to build things instead of rotting the land for junky stuff. I'm disgusted but at least I sorted my junk at your house as it's called.\n\nYour cloned copy has been living into a backwards town in Long River Place State dubbed \"Win's Ville\" unsure of that name.\n\nI know that name came from the High Council who said \"We insist on that name of Win's Ville than that name that rhymes with the word bin which doesn't make any sense.\"\n\nAnyway I cleaned out one attic of one part of the house but the rest of the house's attic I didn't bother to do that cleaning. I got too tired to clean some more plus your clone had three kitties trapped onto the first floor of the house while I was on the second floor sorting. The three kitties were heard making a racket of meowing from being trapped onto the first floor. Ugh drove me to not finish my job of sorting into the other two attics. I only sorted in one attic then once done opened the door to the stairwell which the kitties only one ran upstairs to sniff. The other one hung around demanding attention from me while the third a male dubbed Bogart ran into your clone's main bedroom to hide underneath the bed.\n\nBogart is habitually afraid of visitors and is close to your clone despite your cloned copy calls himself \"My name is Rob Marina refer me as dad, if you want, Victoria.\"\n\nI've been referring the clone as a clone as his titled name than anything else. I still call him daddy into his presence despite I'm not sure if he's still officially my daddy raiser by the High Council. Oh well. Talk more later on flip side Robert.\n\nI don't know what to type in here lately. I think I'm getting bored with things that my life isn't that exciting. That's what I get for living in Jinks Montreal's residence watched and spied on where I'm going. I'm suffering from being bored with a capital B, not much to add. I feel like I haven't heard from anyone in my circle on the college soccer team where I played goalkeeper. I don't know what's new with them despite I'm kept in contact by internet profile website.\n\nOne of the players on the soccer team retired like I am retired announced \"I had a baby boy last month.\"  \nHer profile lists her as married said \"I had my first child a boy named Carter.\"\n\nI find that good for her. I also have Mavis' family who considers me family despite Mavis' connection towards me.\n\nI found that Mavis' family involves Mavis and his younger brother Mason who announced \"My wife had a baby at the first of the month.\"  \nThe child is Mason's second kid I refer Mavis and Mason as cousins in the family way. Oh well. I think I'll just hope this cousin sends me an email and a picture of the new tyke too. I just don't know what to do in Jinks Montreal's residence lately. I'm just dying for the cold to come rolling. Today is really hot that I managed to brave the heat to go outside to the College's City Library. I'm glad that I have something to do on the computer. I'm just not sure why I'm bored. I don't know what else to do next. How boring of me.\n\nTime\n\nTime Gone  \nTime of old,  \nTime of young,  \nTime of all,  \nMinutes,  \nHands,  \nHours,  \nSeconds,  \nTicking away,  \nBit by bit,  \nLife and life,  \nBirth,  \nNew life born,  \nDeath,  \nLife gone,  \nYears,  \nCenturies,  \nDays,  \nGoing by,  \nForever gone,  \nInto the past,  \nNever to return,  \nAgain  \nBut remembered,  \nIn history,  \nBy the future,  \nFor eternity.\n\nI got up around eight o'clock in the morning excited about Lancemas Day when I lived into a dorm room with myself in a room shared by a door to another room that led to another roommate's part of the room. I recalled that Mavis came over to see me and we opened presents.\n\nI told by Mavis asking me \"What do you want for Lancemas Day?\" I said \"No religious themed gifts because I don't feel any connection with religion at the moment.\"\n\nMavis with a sheepish expression gave me some religious themed books based on the High Council group seen in a good light which I stuffed on the bottom of a box for storage at my Dad's house. I hate it when people promised that they won't do some thing and wounds up doing it. Also Mavis gave me some things I already had like a nightgown, a bathrobe and a pack bag. I already have the exact copies of them which I pointed out to Mavis.\n\nMavis said \"I keep on forgetting that I already gave you the items.\"\n\nThen we went to church called \"Saint Lance the Redeemer.\" where I daydream not paying attention to the sermons that I even fell asleep.\n\nI was daydreaming about some story ideas that have been running in my head. I like to type down stories and I sometimes have ideas in my head that I either write or type down onto the computer. So I fell asleep sitting in church with Mavis who shook me awake.\n\nI wound up told by Mavis \"You should visit your Dad's house in Win's Ville.\"\n\nMavis and I didn't hung out too long instead he saw me to my dorm room despite escorted by the dorm room's keeper guard some black skinned humanoid with black human eyes that seemed to know whenever ladies or females have visitors into their dorm room. It's eerie like this guard dubbed Guard Beers seemed to have some sixth sense to alert him of visitors visiting females in their dorm rooms including kicking out unwanted males trying to slobber kisses onto females for sexual favors.\n\nUgh anyway Mavis once he left I emailed dad in Win's Ville \"Do you want me to visit you?\"\n\nHe sent me an email saying in response \"Come see me when's its possible tomorrow the next day in the morning at eleven o'clock.\"\n\nDad always sleeps later than I do despite I'm disciplined to get up around eight o'clock in the morning every day including disciplined to crash into bed around ten o'clock at night.\n\nI packed a bag and slept somewhat poorly despite sleeping in church. That sleeping in church was rather rude of me. I once I could sleep only slept two hours till eight o'clock when the alarm woke me up. I'm always woken up by an alarm clock or I'll keep on sleeping never woken up unless an alarm like noise wakes me up. This is a problem I noticed I seemed to have inherited from the High Council themselves' cloning medical advantages done onto me. Oh well. Once eight o'clock arrived I woke up and got up starting my day which around ten o'clock Mavis came with the guard.\n\n\"You could use me.\" as said by Mavis who seemed to anticipate me going to Win's Ville.\n\nI thrust Mavis my overnight bag who said \"Ooh Vicky!\"\n\nFor the records I hate the name of Vicky for it reminded me of the joke \"Sticky Vicky\" as teased by students in middle school who outcast me for being daughter of a deathless male named Jinks Montreal.\n\nMavis acted as my bodyguard from Star's Hall as that town is called by the High Council as insisted than that name of Storrs in Long River Place State also known as Connecticut. The High Council insisted on the name change out of finding the name of Connecticut not making sense. Their responsible for name changes of various locations within the United States despite the nation isn't referred as America but referred as United States of High Council Republic.\n\nSometimes people refer the nation \"United Crap Republic\" Or \"UCR.\"\n\nI went to Mavis' family house to open a gift and I got some thing from him.\n\nA driver of the residence Jinks Montreal drove me to the Mavis' family house where I had lunch and then opened more presents. I even brought along my video camera and took some shots of the family and their cat a calico like female that's always cranky. After presents a declared Mavis' brother Mason and family wound up going home early which was followed by Mavis and I going home early too. I think Lancemas was ok but several relatives like Mavis' brother and wife including two off springs were falling asleep after opening presents. I think they were tired.\n\nMelanie as Mason's wife likes to be called said to me \"I'm being tired from taking care of a fussy baby.\" hence she falling asleep on the couch.\n\nI even saw one of the kids a boy toddler aged dubbed junior yawning while sitting on the couch with his mother. I have a Lancemas tree up in dorm's lounge room's place which I have to decide on when to yank that thing down. I could wait till tomorrow after Lancemas' is over to bring the tree down or wait till January sixth another holiday celebrating your association as an All Seeing One God that isn't celebrated very much.\n\nI think I'll sleep on the subject of taking down the tree waiting to see on whether I'll make up my mind. I think Lancemas was better holiday than the fiasco on Thanks' Day as said by the High Council to change Thanksgiving to that name. I'm so glad about that cause I got to celebrate the holiday with my family and relatives too.\n\nYawn, I've been tired lately as I remembered when I stayed in one of the apartments in Mountain View owned by Jinks Montreal himself. I heard a rumor that apartment complex was gifted to him out of someone loyalty towards the Lance Richard deity lord status. I've been getting up early for two days in a row as remembered around six o'clock. It'll be a third day in a row that morning and that's for class at another college I'm going for writings. I'm not a morning person and I find myself drinking caffeine soda so I could stay awake. Ugh I hate getting up early. I hate it when the weather is freezing in my place that I don't want to get up from my warm bed. Today the weather is freezing cold. Brr! I prefer to sleep late as around eight thirty. I find that I have to put up with bills such as high electricity bills because my heat is on electricity which means I have to be really strict on how high I leave the heat on. I also don't leave the heat on when I'm not home. I don't see why I should bother to do that. This costs me money. Today a house inspector came in today and examined the place. He found only two flaws but the rest of the place was fine. I just need to get a light switch fixed and a ventilator fan fixed and then the place will be in working order. I just can't wait, which means having to wait at a certain time for the handyman to visit and fix the two flaws. Last time I did that just for a toilet handle I wound up missing a class last semester for the handyman to visit and fix the problems. I really hate having to put my life on hold for the handyman to fix the two flaws in my place. Not my thing but at least the two flaws will be fixed. I think it's about time. So I just can't wait for bed tonight because I get to snooze some more. I also can't wait for weekend is when I get to sleep later than getting up early. I'm worried about the Landlord and the Handyman.\n\nI got a letter yesterday about the flaws and that there'll be another house inspection next month in Mars Month. What I'm worried about is the Landlord not providing a Handyman to fix the flaws found. I'm just worried about that because if I get kicked out, Dad won't take me back in his house. I don't want to go back to his house period. I like being in my own place and having stuff to do myself. I have mixed reviews about my first year in the place I've been living in. I just have to think positive about the Landlord getting the flaws in the place fixed in time for Mars' house inspection. I also worry about being kicked out too. I just will have to keep on thinking positive thoughts for this. I figured I'll wait till the beginning of Mars to complain to the Landlord if the Handyman hasn't made an appearance to fix everything that was listed in the letter by the house inspector. I can't help it that I worry about this. I have mixed reactions on living here due to fighting loneliness and boredom. I'm hoping that a pet will help to shake things up. I don't want to get a ferret for having a pet. I prefer to get a cat instead but I'm not sure what kind of cat. I've been eyeing my eye on this website of a local animal shelter. The dogs in that website have been mostly adopted except one. I don't feel like getting a dog at the moment. I feel like a cat will have to do for me. I just don't know if the landlord will grant me a cat or not. I just don't know at the moment. I have to wait till my lease is up in Mars to see if the Landlord will resign me. I also have a new worry about the Landlord telling me to leave after living here for a year. I don't know what I'll do then. I just will have to ask around for help if this happens. I'm hoping this won't happen at all. I can't help it that I worry. I guess I should stop worrying and leave it to a higher power like Lance Richard.\n\nMy friend Morena has a saying \"God helps those who help themselves.\"\n\nThe saying means to Morena \"God will help people if they help themselves with their problems.\"\n\nI guess I have to hope that my worries are for nothing and that I really should think of positive things instead.\n\nUgh, Valentine's Day, was a stormy day despite declared a day for people to make love by the High Council or having sexual games rituals. New York City is where I currently live in got hit with the snow storm named Agita. I wonder where they thoughts up with those names for a storm anyway. I had a good day playing hooky from school while home at Jinks Montreal's residence stuck into my bedroom. I mostly watched videos onto my laptop computer from a channel website I subscribe to. They were a women's college gymnastics meet from Albany College competing against Fashion Yorkville College. I saw a questionnaire pageant called Miss America on the laptop which Dad taped for me by emailing me the entire tape which I saw. I don't get much TV channels here in Jinks Montreal's residence and I had to get the cheapest internet service for my laptop. I had a lousy reception when I first moved in into Jinks Montreal's residence. I wound up with the cheapest internet service I could get from Dad's input of emailing me. He also gets cable too but it's the more expensive kind because he gets more channels. I feel like that Valentine's Day's weather ruined some people's day of Love. Ugh, who cares about love? I had a boyfriend who turned out to be a jerk who blamed the moment of love on a spell instead of taking responsibility. The moment of love was touching me on the chest just to feel me. He instead of taking responsibility told me some friend of his made a witch spell on the both of us hence he acting this way. I just don't buy it at all. I wound up feeling disgusted, upset and used too. I wound up breaking up with him on the cell phone. What a jerk anyway, who needs to love someone else that isn't family? I feel like I'm fated to be alone for the rest of my life except the future could have surprises for me. I could fall in love with a guy again someday. I just don't know who it is. There was a guy at school who I liked but he moved away and hasn't returned my email response message to his email at all. I think this guy is an either busy or a real loner. I just don't know at all.\n\nThere was another guy at school who I really liked when I first started school there in New York City people commenting \"Is she your girlfriend?\"\n\nI was hurt when the guy told other people \"She's just a friend and not a girlfriend.\"\n\nI never got around to telling this guy how I feel because he says \"I don't want to know much about you and your inner problems at all.\"\n\nThat's the truth and who needs love anyway?\n\nI volunteered to sell some sodas for a deaf school in Toronto dubbed Tornado's College. I volunteered today along with a pizza sale for Southern Long River Place's State's scholarship too. I sort of got roped into doing the soda sale too.\n\nI was at a writers' club class meeting other writers mostly students of the college to discuss our work which one asked me \"You willing to volunteer to sell soda for Tornado's College?\"\n\n\"I had nothing to do for the day of the soda sale.\" I blurt which the student a female appearing to be a Builder or Compeller using some mind control trick despite having an Asian like Highlander look onto her eyes.\n\nThe student said in response \"Terrific Vicky here volunteers for the soda sale.\"\n\nI wound up blurting out of compulsion \"I agreed to volunteer.\"\n\nThat was arranged and I got roped into service of volunteering to sell sodas despite another club the Annoyovs hosting a pizza sale at the same time.\n\nI told Morena on the phone some time ago \"There's a school for the deaf in Toronto dubbed Tornado's College which we're raising money for.\"\n\nMorena gave me a bunch of questions \"Where the money is going to in Toronto? What's with the school requesting money for college to give them? Why can't Tornado's College earn their own money without help from other colleges?\"\n\nI'm surprised with Morena and her stupid questions.\n\nI think Morena is saying \"I'm implying that the money isn't going to that school at all but to elsewhere like the High Council.\"\n\nI think I might want to ask around \"What's with Tornado's College having this money issue?\"\n\nAs for the soda sale was lousy because only ten people brought soda.\n\nThe people were said \"I'm more interested in buying pizza than soda.\"\n\nI bought one soda myself and so did about some other people too.\n\nI practically had to beg people to buy some soda too \"Buy some soda for Tornado's College please.\"\n\nI even asked \"Would you please buy soda?\" and some gave me \"No thank you.\" While others said \"I want pizza than soda.\" Ugh.\n\nI'm annoyed because the soda sale was lousy. I hate it when I put expectations high and they come crashing down to earth.\n\nEven one student I've seen hanging around me in my classes and in writers' club like a stalker named Tom Thunder said to me in response to me begging him \"Would you please buy some soda?\" He said \"People won't buy the soda because of the soda machines and the soda in the school cafeteria.\"\n\n\"This talk annoyed me!\" I said in response which Tom wound up adding \"Don't volunteer for soda sales anymore.\"\n\nI wound up once soda sale was done thinking \"I'm not sure if I'll volunteer for the soda sale again any more. I think I'll just let someone else do the work when it comes to selling soda.\"\n\nBy the way Tom Thunder is a member of the Annoyov club who seemed to be fixated onto me like a stalker or some male who's seemed to want me to do sexual games with him into bed hence he kept giving me this smirking smile whenever I see him around college. Ugh.\n\nMorena you by phone communications have been telling me \"There's the High Council group doing scams for money coming out of Toronto.\"\n\n\"I ask where you come up with this talk.\" I asked you by phone which you told me \"I got this from a TV News program about High Council's servants scamming people for money. This scamming was to make people serve the group in response to paying off a debt.\" I'm told.\n\nI don't know what to do. I wound up e-mailing the president Sydney Australia no joke on that name despite dubbing herself that of the writers' club I'm an officer of which I'm secretary. I hope the President knows what to do about this talk by you which your talk has brought some doubts and has made me upset about the school for the deaf in Toronto. I have no idea on what to do about this attitude of yours. I'm not happy about this at all. Anyway I'm frankly disappointed in your lousy attitude towards the money we worked so hard to rise.\n\nI'm just disgusted by your talk said \"I think your helping scammers of the High Council earn money.\"\n\nI had to e-mail the President of the writers' club about this talk of yours which I said \"I received talk from a close friend that the money earned for Tornado's College is really going to the High Council's group scamming people out of money. I'm just upset with this talk so let me know what I can do to assure this friend's fears.\"\n\nI just hope there's proof of the money going to the school of the deaf in Toronto.\n\nI really hope so, so I could prove it to you and your lousy attitude. Where did you come up with this scam crap anyway?! I can't believe that you got it from a TV program! I'm just annoyed and not happy with you at all. I am upset about earning the money for a scam. I'm hoping that this scam thing is not real but something you misheard. That's what I'm hoping for. If it is a scam what are we going to do with the money we earned? I guess we could use it for something else instead. I just hope the school isn't a scam at all and that's what I'm hoping for.\n\nI hate to have you tell me \"I told you so.\" when we find out if the school is a scam.\n\nUgh, I'm disappointed about that anyway in your attitude of finding the negative thing involving what we're doing is good. Yuck this annoyed me.\n\n\"Letters in the Edenia series featuring clone Victoria Montreal dubbed Yana Renova.\" This is written by the High Council insisting \"You to correct for grammar mistakes.\"\n\nI corrected the grammar and mistakes including emailing to the High Council \"Anything else I can do for you?\"'\n\nThey emailed in response \"Nothing else but thank you for your service.\"\n\nI didn't do much after that but I wound up with the voice going off as a result despite unsure of what to do tonight besides the usual taking my pill at five o'clock and hope it'll do it's job in cutting the noises into my head. Ugh.\n\nMom came over which cutesy cat let me know by getting off my lap and wounding up hiding behind the couch. Poor kitty is still shy around visitors. Oh well. Mom drove me to the town library where she bought a book by an author I doubt I would read. After that mom tried to buy a gift basket but the librarian didn't have anything for breaking mom's twenty dollar bill. This is really annoying. Ugh. After that gift basket was refused buying mom drove me to Ant's where we sat in the car waiting for whomever to show up. Uncle Budweiser as he's referred himself than no explanation to that beer name showed up. I pointed out to mom trying to take a nap in the car. Mom got Uncle Budweiser to help her with her fire alarm then after that Cousin Carina as she's referred arrived then Auntie Berliner followed by Uncle Jack Wiser Yay. Anyway we went into the restaurant and hogged two tables for eating our meals. Oh well I guess we were piglets eating food and gluttony galore. Oh sucks.\n\nI wound up into a writing conversation with Auntie Berliner \"Did you get your hair cut?\"\n\nI was talking about her new haircut she had which she told me something I didn't get it her words so she wrote them down into my notebook \"Yes I got a new haircut.\"\n\nI find Merra's voice was blaring into my mind making it hard to hear what Auntie Berliner was saying to me out of that I kept saying \"What?\" over and over.\n\nAuntie Berliner figured I was suffering from a voiced episode wrote down her answer. Well nice.\n\nAuntie Berliner wrote \"I had my hair cut for Len's granddaughter wedding. It was October nineteenth. So it does not grow that fast. So I keep it short and curly.\"\n\nI said as written out of Mom kept saying \"Your shouting.\"\n\n\"I'm growing my hair for wigs for people. My hair grows slow too.\"\n\nAuntie Berliner said by written \"I would I could but I dye my hair so they will not accept it. Your hair is natural it will not be a problem. So what else is new? I heard you went to a party at school and enjoyed yourself. That's good. How are your friends Morena and the rest?\"\n\nI wrote after I gave up voicing my answer on mom's shout comment \"Morena's doing great. I email her occasionally she emails me back. I've got gift card to Banera for Morena for Lancemas. She likes Banera. Also party at school was fun. I took home a pie mom and I ate Thursday.\"\n\nAuntie Berliner wrote \"That's nice. I made my own thanksgiving dinner. I miss making pies and cookies. I wish I had more time. The problem is I have is no one around to eat it even if I put it in the freezer. I end up throwing it out. So I cook as much as I can eat. This way it doesn't go to waste!\"\n\nThis is a writing conversation between me and Auntie Berliner at Ant's. I ate regular meal of Mickayla's meal of French fries and a hamburger plain but I didn't eat everything onto my plate. I only ate part of the meal and left some for the waitress to toss out. Oh well. Mom being a piglet ate her food including some of my curly French fries. Auntie Berliner had half her food while Cousin Corona only barely ate much of her food. Ugh a pity. Anyway it was Cousin Corona who paid for our meals.\n\n\"Thanks Cousin Corona!\" I wrote a note to her who she gave me a gesture of kissing onto her hand and towards me.\n\nUncle Jack Wiser handed out birthday and Lancemas cards which I figured he's going to be busy during Lancemas' season hence he's handing them out now. Nice I guess. I got one hundred dollars from Uncle Jack Wiser in two fifty dollar bills for my book safe's money. Nice. I got a cloth bag from the restaurant's worker handing them out. That's nice.\n\nAfter eating our food I had to pester my relatives \"We have to leave because of us hogging tables that people would like to use to eat their meals off of.\"\n\nOh well Uncle Jack Wiser took the message and left then Uncle Budweiser followed by us girls going out to the car to hug and then leave. Mom took a scenic sunny route home which gave her trouble seeing where she was driving because of the glaring sunlight blaring into her eyes. Poor Momsy aw I had to help her navigate by paying attention to where we were going. This is a pity.\n\nMom got me home and said \"I asked for the computer.\"\n\n\"Here kitty where are you, you silly fur ball?\" she said searching for my cutest cat ever.\n\nOnce she was done doing her search for the baby cat she decided to leave and not use my computer. Ugh I wound up socialized by the baby munchkin hanging around happy to see me home for a nice warm lap. Aw poor baby cat was cold hence she hanging around me for a lap sits including sitting onto my armchair. Poor kitty!\n\nThis is the files of one cloned copy Victoria Montreal Thunder servant of the High Council created for Recorder of Memories to record for files' sakes. End.\n"
