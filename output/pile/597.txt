We also request that parents and students entering school after the initial parent orientation watch a 15 minute orientation video and answer some simple questions in an online course. Please email our Instructional Technologist, Lesley Denny (7-12) or Dana Kickler (PreK-6th), to receive the link to the course. If you have questions about the program, please call or email Ms. Denny.\n\nThe 8 Worst Apps for Your Kids\"Do you really know what your child is up to on the computer or smartphone? Technology, especially if you're a little behind the times, is deceptive; some of the worst apps and games appear as innocent ways to keep in touch with friends, but can turn into venues for inappropriate behavior.\" ~ www.education.com\n\nStudents\nuse texting and other forms or digital social media to communicate.\nTexting and online networks can be a positive experience when used\nappropriately. Students and parents need to understand the serious\nconsequences that can result when digital technologies and devices are\nused inappropriately."
