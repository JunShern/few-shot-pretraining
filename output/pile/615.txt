    "text": "Monday, September 24, 2012\n\nThe \"marriage\" slippery slide\n\nI have recently written about one brave Australian politician who was crucified by the media and even fellow colleagues for daring to speak the truth in public. For his efforts, Cory Bernardi has been pilloried and viciously attacked, and has been forced to resign from one of his positions. See my write-up here.\n\nBut for suggesting that redefining marriage out of existence can possibly lead to others demanding their \u201crights\u201d such as the polyamorists, and even those into bestiality, he is still being hounded and viciously attacked by the PC forces of tolerance and diversity.\n\nThis is all about the censorious stranglehold of political correctness, a secular left pro-homosexual MSM, and gutless politicians who refuse to support their own. It is also about shooting the messenger. The truth is there are all sorts of folks calling for the acceptance of bestiality, both within and without the homosexual community.\n\nIndeed, one of the world\u2019s \u2018greatest ethicists,\u2019 who even wrote the article on ethics for the Encyclopaedia Britannica is quite in support of it. So while Professor Peter Singer gets a Companion of the Order of Australia for his work, Cory Bernardi gets tarred and feathered and run out of town for his. Go figure.\n\nBTW, you can see Singer defending bestiality here, on the ABC show Q&A with the host and most folks just joking about it, thinking this perversion is all just good fun.\n\nThe more radical the homosexual activists get, the more they embolden other sexual activists to push their agendas. It is happening big time with group marriage rights campaigners, incest rights campaigners, paedophile rights campaigners and bestiality rights campaigners.\n\nSo let me offer just a small sample of those pushing for their rights to \u2018human-animal love\u2019. I present them in no particular order, but it should be clear that a cumulative case can be made here.\n\n-Headline: \u201cIndiana Woman Wants to Marry Her Pet Dog \u2013 Tries to Rally Support From Gay Rights\u2019 Activists\u201d. The story begins: \u201cCassandra White of Northern Indiana has petitioned her local government to allow her to marry her dog Brutus. White has sent several letters to gay rights activists to help her lead the march to stop discrimination against her and those like her who should get to \u2018marry whomever they want\u2019. Ms. White has made several unsuccessful attempts to get a marriage license after listing only \u201cBrutus\u201d in the section asking for FULL NAME OF PARTY B on marriage certificate form.\u201d\n\nIt concludes: \u201cMs. White applauded President Obama for announcing that he is in support for gay marriage and quoted the president saying, \u2018I was so happy to hear President Obama yesterday comment on gay marriage.\u2019 Ms. White is asking the state of Indiana to recognize what the president said and change their perspective on allowing her to marry Brutus. White has also received support from \u2018Freedom To Marry Our Pets Society\u2019 who plan to organize a protest in Washington to change definition of marriage to include pets.\u201d\n\n-A woman in Ghana has married her dog. The bride, Emily Mabou, 29 said this: \u201cFor so long I\u2019ve been praying for a life with a partner who has all the qualities of my dad. My dad was kind, faithful and loyal to my mum, and he never let her down.\u201d She claims that her relationships have all been with \u201cskirt-chasers and cheaters.\u201d The priest who performed the ceremony told people not to mock the wedding, but instead \u201crejoice with her, as she has found happiness at last.\u201d\n\n-\u201cZoophiles\u201d are now coming out of the closet. A very lengthy article on this entitled \u201cThose Who Practice Bestiality Say They\u2019re Part of the Next Sexual Rights Movement\u201d has gone into quite a bit of detail on this. It begins this way: \u201cDuring his sophomore year in high school, Cody Beck finally got fed up with hearing homophobic cracks. If his classmates thought being gay was weird (Beck was openly bisexual), he had a confession that would blow their minds. He told them he is sexually attracted to dogs and horses.\n\n\u201c\u2018I just couldn\u2019t keep it in anymore, Beck says. Just for the hell of it, I figured I\u2019d throw it out there and have them make fun of me even more. Which they did. An 18-year-old from Arizona who graduated from high school this past year, Beck says classmates taunted him by calling him Bestiality Dude. Being a \u2018zoophile\u2019 in modern American society, Beck says, is \u2018like being gay in the 1950s. You feel like you have to hide, that if you say it out loud, people will look at you like a freak.\u2019\n\n\u201cNow Beck believes he and other members of this minority sexual orientation, who often call themselves \u2018zoos,\u2019 can follow the same path as the gay rights movement. Most researchers believe 2 to 8 percent of the population harbors forbidden desires toward animals, and Beck hopes this minority group can begin appealing to the open-minded for acceptance.\u201d\n\nAnd of course these folks will tell you it is an orientation \u2013 they just can\u2019t help it. Where have we heard all this before? \u201cAmong the seven zoophiles I consulted for this article, all say that theirs is an orientation and that to meet the definition, one must not harm an animal. For this reason, a man who has sex with chickens, for instance, is not a zoophile because the act is sure to hurt if not kill the chicken. Zoophiles I spoke with say they are as opposed to forcing sex upon animals as the rest of society is opposed to the rape of humans.\u201d\n\n-A homosexual pride march in Spain was quite happy to have their bestiality mates along for the ride. As one report states, \u201c\u2018I like dogs, I like apples, in my bed I sleep with whomever I want,\u2019 was one of the principal chants in the Gay Pride Parade last week in Madrid, where hundreds of thousands marched through the streets to advocate \u2018gay rights\u2019 and homosexualist ideology, according to local media reports.\u201d\n\n-And this just in from Florida: it seems legal loopholes are allowing folks to share the love with their animal friends. As one news item says, \u201cEric Antunes, 29, was arrested in May on charges of child pornography and bestiality. Prosecution has now dropped the bestiality charges due to a \u2018loophole\u2019 in Florida law. One man\u2019s unique case may have uncovered a loophole in Florida law that allows for certain forms of oral sex between humans and animals.\n\n\u201cEric Antunes, 29, was arrested in May on charges of child pornography and bestiality. After allegedly finding images of child pornography on his home computer, investigators say they searched his cell phone and discovered photos of Antunes engaged in sexual acts with his girlfriend\u2019s three-legged dog. Florida outlawed bestiality in October 2011. When Antunes was first arrested, many believed he would be among the first few people to be prosecuted under the new law.\u201d\n\nThese are just a few of many examples which I can present here. I presented more such cases of this in my earlier article on Bernardi. Once we allow marriage to be destroyed by the sexual militants, then anything goes. And all the various sexual activist groups know it.\n\nA few decades ago pro-family forces were mocked, ridiculed and treated with contempt when they said that allowing de facto unions full marriage rights would open the door to homosexual marriage rights being demanded. They were derided and scorned as hysterical, fear-mongering extremists holding repugnant views.\n\nTHE Opposition has questioned the motives of 5000 Sri Lankan asylum seekers who have arrived in Australia, as new figures show boat arrivals from the country have overtaken those from war-torn Afghanistan.\n\nAs 16 Sri Lankan asylum seekers agreed at the weekend to return home instead of facing detention on Nauru, Opposition Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Julie Bishop said the move \"calls into question\" the processing of every application since the country's 25-year civil war ended in 2009.\n\n\"As asylum seekers, I assume that they were seeking to flee from persecution,\" Ms Bishop told the ABC.\n\nShe questioned why the group would therefore choose to return home, rather than go to the \"safe haven\" of Nauru.\n\nThe number of Sri Lankans arriving has soared this year to 3536, up from just 211 arrivals last year, and exceeding the 2996 Afghan arrivals.\n\nIt's the biggest number of arrivals ever recorded by Sri Lankans, including during the years in which a violent civil war killed more than 70,000 people and hugely damaged the economy.\n\nGovernment figures show just 163 Sri Lankans arriving by boat have been granted humanitarian visas this year, but it is understood many of the arrivals are still being assessed.\n\nIt follows Opposition suggestions earlier this month the Government strike a deal with Sri Lanka to send asylum seekers intercepted at sea back to their home country \"before they set foot on Australian soil\" as most were economic refugees.\n\nThe Government said such a move would break international responsibilities.\n\nRefugee Action Coalition spokesman Nick Riemer said the civil war may be officially over, but conditions for Tamils were still \"very dire\". \"There are reports of disappearances ... there are reports of torture by the Sri Lankan authorities,\" he said.\n\n\"The fact that there are 16 people who have consented, or who have been pressured, into returning doesn't tell us anything about the overall situation of all of the other Sri Lankans who are still in the Australian system, who are still coming here, and who are still evidently desperate to get out of the country.\"\n\nOpposition Immigration spokesman Scott Morrison said more boats have arrived in the first quarter of the financial year than the Government budgeted for 12 months.\n\nMr Morrison said boats continued to arrive daily, in spite of the new offshore processing regime, including 25 boats in the first 23 days of this month.\n\nA SERIES of anti-Islamic protests planned for every Australian capital city and promoted by members of marginal, anti-immigration political groups were effectively suppressed by police yesterday.\n\nDespite trying to organise co-ordinated protests, demonstrators ultimately took to the streets only in Melbourne and Perth, with Sydney -- scene of the previous weekend's running battles between police and young Muslim men -- remaining quiet.\n\nIn Melbourne, members of the right-wing Nationalist Alternative were among a small crowd, which also included Muslims and atheist groups, who gathered outside the state library.\n\nSpeaking to the crowd through a microphone, one of these men said the former Victorian attorney-general Rob Hulls had gone too far when he changed the laws to make religious vilification illegal.\n\nUnder the gaze of dozens of police officers, the demonstration eventually ended without incident.\n\nIn Sydney, two men were arrested on Friday for allegedly using social media to incite violence over the weekend.\n\nThe pair was reportedly trying to whip up anti-Islamic sentiment, following the previous weekend's protests in the city against an online film, Innocence of Muslims, that ridicules the Islamic faith.\n\nEleven people have been charged over this violence, in which four people were taken to hospital. NSW Police commanders will continue to investigate those involved.\n\nA number of other protests had been planned for Sydney, police said, with supporters of the anti-immigration Australian Protectionist Party among those who said they would demonstrate outside the NSW parliament.\n\nA petition on Facebook had called for protests in every state and territory capital, saying the previous weekend's violence \"once again shined a light on the darker side of Islam\".\n\n\"It is time that we as Australians stand up and defend our land from this extremist behaviour,\" it said.\n\nWith hundreds of extra police in the Sydney CBD, however, no such demonstration took place.\n\nThe NSW Premier, Barry O'Farrell, said the extra police had \"exerted control\".\n\n\"I think they've told people that this sort of extremism, this sort of violence, is unwelcome in any community,\" he said.\n\nPolice also outnumbered protesters in Perth, with less than a dozen turning up to an anti-Islam demonstration outside parliament house.\n\nOne of those, who gave his name only as Tony, said he was concerned that Australia was being too influenced by Islam.\n\n\"This is a country where people are free to express religious beliefs, but when you have one group of people that want to impose their religious and political beliefs, the average Australian should be concerned about it,\" he said. \"This country has accepted people of all races, creeds and colours but the violence people are prepared to use is unacceptable. If it was a group of Catholics, I would still be here.\"\n\nWest Australian Premier Colin Barnett said the violence in Sydney represented a dark day for Australia. \"One of the great things about Australian society is people from all different races and backgrounds and religions have been able to live happily and peacefully together,\" he said.\n\n\"I will always support the right for people to protest . . . so long as they do it in a peaceful way. Unfortunately, in Sydney last weekend, it got out of control.\"\n\nA DECISION to hire an expert in \"nudge theory\" to advise the state government on innovative ways to influence people's behaviour has been called into question by suggestions it may be of limited use.\n\nThe initiative is inspired by the British government's \"nudge unit\", formally know as the Behavioural Insights Team, which was established in 2010.\n\nThe unit seeks to achieve social change without the need for government regulation by employing behavioural science techniques. For example, it might use peer influence to increase energy efficiency by telling one person how their power use compares with their neighbour's.\n\nA senior member of the British team, Rory Gallagher, will be seconded to the NSW government for a year from November to assist the Department of Premier and Cabinet in formulating a local approach.\n\nBut last year the British minister for government policy, Oliver Letwin, told a House of Lords committee the nudge unit was experimental and there was no concrete evidence it would work.\n\n\"It is, of course, an open question as to whether any of this will have any effect whatsoever,\" he told the committee.\n\nMr Letwin defended the Behavioural Insights Team by saying it was low cost, with \"almost zero risk\". The unit, which employs seven people, costs \u00a3520,000 ($806,400) a year to run.\n\nThe admission followed a National Audit Office report that said it had been unable to convince government departments to consider any of its ideas. Earlier this month the president-elect of the British Science Association, Lord Krebs, said nudge techniques should not be seen as a replacement for traditional government regulation.\n\nHowever, the Cabinet Office says it has saved British taxpayers at least \u00a3300 million.\n\n1 comment:\n\nPaul\nsaid...\n\nThe question arises: are the Tamil Tigers reconstituting here in Australia under the guise of being \"refugees\"? I seem to recall many years of them making life in Sri Lanka rather \"dire\" for anyone who wasn't a Tamil. I think of them more as fugitives rather than refugees.\n\nBackground\n\nPostings from Brisbane, Australia by John Ray (M.A.; Ph.D.) -- former member of the Australia-Soviet Friendship Society, former anarcho-capitalist and former member of the British Conservative party.\n\nMost academics are lockstep Leftists so readers do sometimes doubt that I have the qualifications mentioned above. Photocopies of my academic and military certificates are however all viewable here\n\nFor overseas readers: The \"ALP\" is the Australian Labor Party -- Australia's major Leftist party. The \"Liberal\" party is Australia's major conservative political party.\n\nIn most Australian States there are two conservative political parties, the city-based Liberal party and the rural-based National party. But in Queensland those two parties are amalgamated as the LNP.\n\nAgain for overseas readers: Like the USA, Germany and India, Australia has State governments as well as the Federal government. So it may be useful to know the usual abbreviations for the Australian States: QLD (Queensland), NSW (New South Wales), WA (Western Australia), VIC (Victoria), TAS (Tasmania), SA (South Australia).\n\nFor American readers: A \"pensioner\" is a retired person living on Social Security\n\n\"Digger\" is an honorific term for an Australian soldier\n\nAnother lesson in Australian: When an Australian calls someone a \"big-noter\", he is saying that the person is a chronic and rather pathetic seeker of admiration -- as in someone who often pulls out \"big notes\" (e.g. $100.00 bills) to pay for things, thus endeavouring to create the impression that he is rich. The term describes the mentality rather than the actual behavior with money and it aptly describes many Leftists. When they purport to show \"compassion\" by advocating things that cost themselves nothing (e.g. advocating more taxes on \"the rich\" to help \"the poor\"), an Australian might say that the Leftist is \"big-noting himself\". There is an example of the usage here. The term conveys contempt. There is a wise description of Australians generally here\n\nAnother bit of Australian: Any bad writing or messy anything was once often described as being \"like a pakapoo ticket\". In origin this phrase refers to a ticket written with Chinese characters - and thus inscrutably confusing to Western eyes. These tickets were part of a Chinese gambling game called \"pakapoo\".\n\nTwo of my ancestors were convicts so my family has been in Australia for a long time. As well as that, all four of my grandparents were born in the State where I was born and still live: Queensland. And I am even a member of the world's second-most condemned minority: WASPs (the most condemned is of course the Jews -- which may be why I tend to like Jews). So I think I am as Australian as you can get. I certainly feel that way. I like all things that are iconically Australian: meat pies, Vegemite, Henry Lawson etc. I particularly pride myself on my familiarity with the great Australian slanguage. I draw the line at Iced Vo-Vos and betting on the neddies, however. So if I cannot comment insightfully on Australian affairs, who could?\n\nMy son Joe\n\nOn all my blogs, I express my view of what is important primarily by the readings that I select for posting. I do however on occasions add personal comments in italicized form at the beginning of an article.\n\nI am rather pleased to report that I am a lifelong conservative. Out of intellectual curiosity, I did in my youth join organizations from right across the political spectrum so I am certainly not closed-minded and am very familiar with the full spectrum of political thinking. Nonetheless, I did not have to undergo the lurch from Left to Right that so many people undergo. At age 13 I used my pocket-money to subscribe to the \"Reader's Digest\" -- the main conservative organ available in small town Australia of the 1950s. I have learnt much since but am pleased and amused to note that history has since confirmed most of what I thought at that early age.\n\nI imagine that the the RD is still sending mailouts to my 1950s address!\n\nI am an army man. Although my service in the Australian army was chiefly noted for its un-notability, I DID join voluntarily in the Vietnam era, I DID reach the rank of Sergeant, and I DID volunteer for a posting in Vietnam. So I think I may be forgiven for saying something that most army men think but which most don't say because they think it is too obvious: The profession of arms is the noblest profession of all because it is the only profession where you offer to lay down your life in performing your duties. Our men fought so that people could say and think what they like but I myself always treat military men with great respect -- respect which in my view is simply their due.\n\nThe kneejerk response of the Green/Left to people who challenge them is to say that the challenger is in the pay of \"Big Oil\", \"Big Business\", \"Big Pharma\", \"Exxon-Mobil\", \"The Pioneer Fund\" or some other entity that they see, in their childish way, as a boogeyman. So I think it might be useful for me to point out that I have NEVER received one cent from anybody by way of support for what I write. As a retired person, I live entirely on my own investments. I do not work for anybody and I am not beholden to anybody. And I have NO investments in oil companies or mining companies\n\nAlthough I have been an atheist for all my adult life, I have no hesitation in saying that the single book which has influenced me most is the New Testament. And my Scripture blog will show that I know whereof I speak.\n\nThe Rt. Rev. Phil Case (Moderator of the Presbyterian church in Queensland) is a Pharisee, a hypocrite, an abomination and a \"whited sepulchre\".\n\nEnglish-born Australian novellist, Patrick White was a great favourite in literary circles. He even won a Nobel prize. But I and many others I have spoken to find his novels very turgid and boring. Despite my interest in history, I could only get through about a third of his historical novel Voss before I gave up. So why has he been so popular in literary circles? Easy. He was a miserable old Leftist coot, and, incidentally, a homosexual. And literary people are mostly Leftists with similar levels of anger and alienation from mainstream society. They enjoy his jaundiced outlook, his dissatisfaction, rage and anger.\n\nWould you believe that there once was a politician whose nickname was \"Honest\"? \"Honest\" Frank Nicklin M.M. was a war hero, a banana farmer and later the conservative Premier of my home State of Queensland in the '60s. He was even popular with the bureaucracy and gave the State a remarkably tranquil 10 years during his time in office. Sad that there are so few like him.\n\nRevered Labour Party leader Gough Whitlam was a very erudite man so he cannot have been unaware of the similarities of his famous phrase \u201cthe Party, the platform, the people\u201d with an earlier slogan: \"Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Fuehrer\". It's basically the same slogan in reverse order.\n\nAustralia's original inhabitants were a race of pygmies, some of whom survived into modern times in the mountainous regions of the Atherton tableland in far North Queensland. See also here. Below is a picture of one of them taken in 2007, when she was 105 years old and 3'7\" tall\n\nJulia Gillard, a failed feminist flop. She was given the job of Prime Minister of Australia but her feminist preaching was so unpopular that she was booted out of the job by her own Leftist party. Her signature \"achievements\" were the carbon tax and the mining tax, both of which were repealed by the next government.\n\nThe \"White Australia Policy: \"The Immigration Restriction Act was not about white supremacy, racism, or the belief that whites were higher up the evolutionary tree than the coloured races. Rather, it was designed to STOP the racist exploitation of non-whites (all of whom would have been illiterate peasants practicing religions and cultures anathema to progressive democracy) being conscripted into a life of semi-slavery in a coolie-worked plantation economy for the benefit of the absolute monarchs, hereditary aristocracy and the super-wealthy companies and share-holders of the northern hemisphere.\n\nA great little kid\n\nIn November 2007, a four-year-old boy was found playing in a croc-infested Territory creek after sneaking off pig hunting alone with four dogs and a puppy. The toddler was found five-and-a-half hours after he set off from his parents' house playing in a creek with the puppy. Amazingly, Daniel Woditj also swam two creeks known to be inhabited by crocs during his adventurous romp. Mr Knight said that after walking for several kilometres, Daniel came to a creek and swam across it. Four of his dogs \"bailed up\" at the creek but the youngster continued on undaunted with his puppy to a second creek. Mr Knight said Daniel swam the second croc-infested creek and walked on for several more kilometres. \"Captain is a hard bushman and Daniel is following in his footsteps. They breed them tough out bush.\"\n\nA great Australian: His eminence George Pell.

Similar content can be more conveniently accessed via my subject-indexed list of short articles here or here (I rarely write long articles these days)\n\nNOTE: The archives provided by blogspot below are rather inconvenient. They break each month up into small bits. If you want to scan whole months at a time, the backup archives will suit better. See here or here\n\nAbout Me\n\nI am a 5'10\" tall, jocular former university teacher aged 70 at the time of writing in early 2014 who still has a fair bit of hair. I am Australian born of working class origins and British ancestry. My doctorate is in psychology but I taught mainly sociology (Research Methods) in my 14 years as a university teacher. In High Schools I taught economics. I have taught in both traditional and \"progressive\" (low discipline) High Schools. My main interests are blogging, classical music, history, the stockmarket, current affairs and languages. I have been married four times to four fine women with whom I am still on amicable terms. I have one son born in 1987. I am totally non-sporting and have never owned a firearm. My brother has enough guns for the whole family. I did however enjoy my weapons training in the Army.\nFuller biographical notes here"
