    "text": "Everything that's gold does not glitter\n\nsociology\n\nPost navigation\n\nSunday afternoon. Sitting in our car in front of a Wal-Mart on the drive back from my parents\u2019 house down south. My wife ran in for a minute to get a couple of things, so I get to people watch in my air conditioned cocoon, buffered from the 104\u00b0F heat just outside my door.\n\nI feel sorry for the cart guy as he leans into his conga line of shopping trolleys in the searing sun. Here comes a young woman in an orange T-shirt (logo illegible from this distance) and bright purple hair. We once had a Chevy that color, but I never associated it with a part of the human body. Out comes a middle aged woman pushing an empty cart. You have to wonder what\u2019s up with that. Wouldn\u2019t you leave the cart in the store if you couldn\u2019t find what you\u2019re looking for? Maybe she needed the cart to lean on. The woman\u2019s deeply wrinkled face makes her look old, perhaps a legacy of years of nicotine. Indeed, she has a cigarette hanging from her lips; the second she crosses the store\u2019s threshold into the dreadful heat, she lights it.\n\nMy thoughts drift away to our Fathers\u2019 Day visit to my dad. We went out to dinner to a local Italian place on Friday night (I need the gluten-free pizza crust, please, and here\u2019s a little Baggie of vegan cheese to use in place of the mozzarella, okay?) and to a steak house on Saturday (an order of broccoli, please, steamed with no butter, and a baked potato with just chives; also a salad with no cheese, croutons or dressing). Family occasions can be a challenge for gluten-free vegans.\n\nIt seems that I seldom come away from a visit to my parents without at least a few stories that I hadn\u2019t heard before. I need to hear these while I still can.\n\nThis time, I learned that my uncle, age 90, is one of the youngest veterans of World War II. He was sent overseas with the Army Air Corps at the very end of the war; when the war ended, he was still eighteen years old.\n\nThen there\u2019s my dad\u2019s take on history. During the Great Depression, he tells me, the life expectancy of an American male was 62 years. A guy who had a job would remain employed until he was too old and sick to work. Then he\u2019d spend a year sitting on a park bench. Then he died. There was no Social Security. No one took care of you, my father went on; people took care of themselves. Before FDR\u2019s New Deal, he told me, our guarantees extended to life, liberty and property. How you ate and paid your rent was up to you.\n\nMy father seems to long for those days. His ideas put me in mind of Archie and Edith Bunker, opening each episode of \u201cAll in the Family\u201d by singing \u201cdidn\u2019t need no welfare state/everybody pulled his weight.\u201d\n\nI have some questions. Was it really like that? Or is it more like wearing rose-colored glasses regarding the Good Old Days? How did the old, sick guy on the park bench support himself for that year? And what about his wife?\n\nI suspect that part of the answer lies in extended families supporting each other. I\u2019ve been rereading Steinbeck\u2019s Grapes of Wrath lately, and it is not lost on me that the Joads dragged the elders of the clan along with them as they headed west, even though Grandpa had to be drugged to prevent him from stubbornly remaining behind.\n\nJust as my octogenarian father waxes wistful over a time long gone, I wish we still lived in an age when people stuck together. The breakdown of the American family over many decades results in people in need having no support (of either the financial or the emotional kind). We have elderly folks living by themselves in little apartments, spouses dead or divorced, children moved to distant cities and states to pursue their own lives and dreams. Perhaps striking out on their own and leaving family behind is reflective of the pursuit of happiness. After all, family members often don\u2019t get along. And yet, in the days before public assistance, it seems that families had to get along just to survive.\n\nIt makes me sad that we seem to cherish the freedom to worship the self and ignore others and, ultimately, the freedom to end up old and alone.\n\nA blog comment I ran across last week suggested that \u201chypocrite\u201d is just about the worst epithet that can be applied to a person. I do not agree. Not at all. It seems to me that hypocrisy has a useful and respectable place in our society and that it has been unfairly maligned over the centuries.\n\nLet\u2019s start by taking a moment to examine the meaning and etymology of the word \u201chypocrite.\u201d Much as I esteem the opinion of the Oxford English Dictionary, I am unable to tell you how they weigh in on the issue, as the online version is behind a paywall and my unemployed ass cannot afford the $995 cost of the 20-volume print edition or even the $400 cost of the compact CD. Making use of the tools that I do have available, dictionary.com cites the origin of the English word \u201chypocrite\u201d as the ancient Greek hypokrites, meaning \u201ca stage actor, hence one who pretends to be what he is not.\u201d\n\nThe original Greek appears to indicate that, at some level, hypocrisy was a socially acceptable construct. Ancient Greek audiences understood perfectly well that the onstage histrionics they were witnessing were the products of talented actors who were not actually being murdered and dismembered before their very eyes. This is often referred to as \u201cwilling suspension of disbelief.\u201d\n\nOnce we leave the stage, however, society has always had a much more difficult time accepting one who \u201cpretends to be what he is not.\u201d Merriam-webster.com defines a hypocrite as \u201ca person who acts in contradiction to his or her stated beliefs or feelings.\u201d In modern times, the epithet \u201ctwo-faced\u201d has been applied to such an individual, but the revulsion visited upon hypocrites goes back centuries. Arguably, the epitome of the public dissing of hypocrites was meted out by Jesus. Among the best known statements about hypocrisy is in Matthew 23:14 (KJV), \u201cWoe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For ye devour widows\u2019 houses, and for a pretense make long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation.\u201d\n\nDespite the bad name given to hypocrisy in the New Testament, I submit to you that being a hypocrite was likely quite practical 2,000 years ago and is certainly so in our modern world of the 21st century.\n\n1. We grew up with hypocrisy. Most of us were introduced to the concept of hypocrisy at an early age, long before the word entered our nascent vocabularies. Either by inference or (as in the case of my own parents) literally, our folks would tell us \u201cDo as I say, not as I do!\u201d If you think about it, this makes sense. All parents have hopes and dreams that their children will do better than they themselves did. As parents, we have bad habits that we do not wish our children to emulate. Of course, children are strongly influenced by the actions of their parents, which is why many fathers quit smoking or drinking or swearing when they learn that a little one is on the way. When we are unable, for whatever reason, to forsake our evil ways, the backup plan has always been to tell the kids to \u201cpay no attention to the man in the mask.\u201d Hypocrisy: It\u2019s how we seek to improve the next generation.\n\n2. Hypocrisy as a coping mechanism. A famous quote from novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald posits that \u201cthe test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function.\u201d We may, for example, simultaneously entertain the ideas that \u201cdrinking alcohol impairs my ability to function\u201d and \u201cI need a drink to get through the day.\u201d (In my own case, I suppose I should substitute ice cream and potato chips.) One may dispute the accuracy of Fitzgerald\u2019s assertion about intelligence, but acting against what we know to be our own best interest is a form of hypocrisy that is a valid coping strategy used to allow us to keep going (and to keep from going crazy) in the face of life\u2019s daily contradictions.\n\n3. Hypocrisy is a reasonable response to society\u2019s persistence in judging us. Back in the years when I worked in the court system, I would regularly hear criminal defendants bemoaning the law\u2019s condemnation of conduct that they found perfectly acceptable. Some of this is decidedly solipsistic in nature, but to a great extent, this sentiment is the product of conflicting cultural norms. As the social workers and probation officers know all too well, the guy in the orange jumpsuit will likely think nothing of committing assault and battery if such conduct is a daily occurrence in his neighborhood, and particularly if he witnessed and/or participated in it as a child and adolescent. \u201cI\u2019m being judged unfairly!\u201d is the prisoner\u2019s mournful moan.\n\nHow does this relate to hypocrisy? Most of us attempt to stay on the right side of the law in order to stay out of jail, but things change considerably when it comes to matters of morality. This may seem only marginally relevant today, but in times of restrictive social norms, we may seek to avoid the judgment of society by publicly spouting the party line while merrily pursuing our own agendas in private. An example I mentioned in a post earlier this week is that many of us kept our criticisms of the government to ourselves in the 1950s to avoid social approbation that could include becoming unemployed and being run out of town. Similarly, for years most gays remained \u201cin the closet,\u201d some even going as far as entering hetero marriages, in order to avoid being judged harshly by those around them. So you can see that saying one thing and doing another is a reasonable response (\u201cI have to live in this town!\u201d) to persistent judgment by a society cherishing norms that directly contradict one\u2019s own. Those who hang out in the third standard deviation pretty much have the choice of being hypocrites or adjusting their behavior to conform with cultural norms. Those who are unable to embrace either approach often find themselves in those orange jumpsuits, or arguably worse, in padded cells.\n\nI have often pondered that much hypocrisy, as well as outright law-breaking, could be avoided if people would relocate to parts of the world in which social norms are better aligned with their predilections. We may be horrified at, and quick to condemn, practices such as the use of hard drugs, allowing minors to consume alcohol or eating the meat of cats and dogs, but there are many areas of the world in which these are not the cultural taboos as they represent in North America. Those who reside here but find it inconvenient to pick up stakes for an intercontinental move to a more compatible social environment often engage in culturally prohibited practices in private while, in public, pretending the horror that our society expects of them. And let us not forget that many throughout history have found becoming hypocrites essential in order to practice their religions while avoiding death at the hands of an intolerant majority.\n\nRather than reviling the hypocrite, perhaps we should consider that none of us is perfect and that every one of us is hypocritical in some fashion at some point in time. For example, we may be staunch advocates of truth-telling, yet accede to telling a \u201cwhite lie\u201d in order to spare someone\u2019s feelings.\n\nAmong the problems that we have with hypocrites is the fear that they will \u201cfool us\u201d and the rage we experience when we feel that we have been duped. This is symptomatic of a simplistic and childlike mindset that paints every situation in black and white. We want to be able to distinguish the \u201cgood guys\u201d from the \u201cbad guys.\u201d Not only does this sentiment fail to acknowledge the complex nature of modern society, but it also errs in equating the good with current social norms. Aside from the fact that such norms change rapidly, it behooves us to recognize the value of diversity and multiculturalism in that individuals with widely divergent traditions, mores and folkways can all make positive contributions to our heterogeneous society.\n\nSome believe that once a hypocrite has been \u201couted,\u201d nothing he or she says may be trusted ever again. We think of politicians who are elected on a \u201claw and order\u201d platform and then are discovered to be crooks themselves. A few years ago, a Scientific American article pointed out that our unwarranted emotional responses to hypocrisy (i.e., our unwillingness to put ourselves in the shoes of the hypocrite or, dare I say, to examine our own hypocrisy) \u201ctend to short-circuit rational examination\u201d of a person\u2019s statements. Just because one acts hypocritically to avoid harsh social judgment in a particular area does not mean that every statement uttered by that individual should be discounted out of hand. Compassion, particularly among those of us who profess efforts to live a godly life, seems in order.\n\nYet compassion appears conspicuously lacking by many, particularly by those on the religious right, who chastise hypocrites as \u201cliars\u201d and \u201chaters of the truth.\u201d It may be more accurate to say that an intolerant, judgmental society is the real hater of truth, the truths that there will always be dissenters in our midst, that there is a place in life for personal choice, and that peaceful coexistence is possible without achieving universal consensus in regard to every belief and practice."
