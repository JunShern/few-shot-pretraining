Today?\n\nIn HTML 5 is there any support for things which are really easy to do in Silverlight?\nFor example, ripping a file (chosen by the user) into an array of bytes that can be base64 encoded and passed up to a web service?\nOr, creation/reading of an image and being able to manipulate the pixels and display this on screen? Or even save it to disk (location chosen by the user)?\nIf so, which browsers would support this and are the APIs consistent?\nThanks\n\nA:\n\nIn HTML 5 is there any support for things which are really easy to do in Silverlight?\n\nSee this\n\nFor example, ripping a file (chosen by the user) into an array of bytes\n\nYes. See this\n\nthat can be base64 encoded \n\nGoogle\n\nand passed up to a web service?\n\nXMLHttpRequest still works.\n\nOr, creation/reading of an image and being able to manipulate the pixels and display this on screen? \n\nYes. Combine FileReader with canvas.\n\nOr even save it to disk (location chosen by the user)?\n\nSorry, not possible. No longer the case! See this.\n\nIf so, which browsers would support this\n\nI know Firefox does, but try this on other browsers. See what works and what doesn't.\n\nand are the APIs consistent?\n\nYes. These are called standards for a reason.\n\n"
