    "text": "Level-5 is releasing the sequel to their critically acclaimed RPG, Ni no Kuni. With a story written by Akihiro Hino, characters designed by Yoshiyuki Momose, and music composed by Joe Hisaishi, this game looks to be shaping up to be pure magic.\n\nWhile the game might be magic, this game is based on betrayal. You play as Evan, son of the King of Ding Dong Dell, who gets ousted from his kingdom by a violent coup at the hands of a mangy rat.\n\nWhile it\u2019s a painful experience for Evan, he doesn\u2019t have the right to actually become king until he earns it. This is done through completing the Trial of Courage and gaining a kingmaker. In Evan\u2019s case, this is the mascot character Lofty, and by forging this Kingsbond he gains the right to lead a kingdom.\n\nWe got a chance to get our hands on a demo of the game and I\u2019ll tell you honestly: I had a great time! The demo that we played focused on a boss fight against an enemy kingmaker that was significantly stronger than Evan. In order to combat this situation, we needed to understand not only the layout of the field, but the locations of our allies.\n\nIn this game you have a great number of small allies called Higgledies that are integral to your success. These are elemental spirits that remind me of the forest spirits in Princess Mononoke.\n\nThese spirits augment your offensive, defensive, and even magical abilities. From what I\u2019ve seen, on the battlefield there are at least 25 of these little guys at the same time and they group up together according to their elements.\n\nGroups of these Higgledies will eventually grant you a boost such as a heightened defense, or even a quick heal that made this \u201cimpossible fight\u201d just pretty difficult. The main character also can use the Higgledies to add an elemental effect onto his own skills.\n\nEach group has their own element and being around a specific element when using your skills will add their element onto your attack. It forces the player to have a keen presence of the battlefield, and I feel it\u2019s going to be a very fun addition to an already interesting combat system.\n\nNow combat is focused on long range and short range mechanics. Long range utilizes spells that can either be shot quickly for practically no damage or charged for a significant amounts of damage. Short Range combat is focused on quick and strong attacks.\n\nSadly these attacks can\u2019t be used in combos with each other, and trying to dodge out, at least from my experience doesn\u2019t even work if you\u2019re in the middle of an attack. This got Michael into a bit of trouble when he got locked into a move without a chance to block a massive area of effect attack.\n\nOutside of combat, we did get a sneak peak on another new bit of gameplay, although we didn\u2019t actually get a chance to record it.\n\nThis new mode is called Kingdom mode. In this mode, Evan is tasked with making his own kingdom. While he may earn the right to be a king throughout the game, he still doesn\u2019t technically have a kingdom anymore.\n\nIn order to build his kingdom up, he must build relationships with people from various cities and ask them to join his kingdom, which is something reminiscent of the Suikoden series. The people he manages to convince to join his kingdom will help him throughout his quest.\n\nThe characters that you recruit help you gather resources, and might even help you in battle. Judging by the gameplay, in Kingdom mode there will be an RTS mini-game of some sort. It is fairly cute with chibi-like characters, and you will be able to command the characters you\u2019ve gathered in this mini-game to gather resources and help you in battle.\n\nNi no Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom was very fun to play. The combat was engaging and the game forced me to think a little more than I normally would in an action RPG. If this is what we\u2019ll be getting in the full game, everyone is in store for a great experience!\n\nNi no Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom is launching on November 10th for PC and PlayStation 4.
