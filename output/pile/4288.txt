The problem I am currently having is that when uploading a new document, I programmatically set the ControlMode of the baseFieldControl to SPControlMode.Display for certain users that should not be able to modify this column's value but should still be able to upload new document to the library. On the edit form, the value that is displayed is \"4\" which is normal as it is the defalut value, but once you save, if you go have a look the items properties, the saved value is \"1\". If you do the same test but using radio buttons it doesn't even save a value, not even the first one. \nSo basically all I want is to be able to set a field \"readonly\" on the edit form when adding a new document but I want the default value to be saved properly.\nThanks for any help you can provide on that issue.\nAlex\n\nA:\n\nIf you want to use your BaseFieldControl with the Display Mode and set a value, you must set the value before setting the ControlMode. \nYou may find a different workaround Here\n\n"
