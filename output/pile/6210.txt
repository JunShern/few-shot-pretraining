I was quite amazed, so I would like to learn origami art.\nCan you provide resources or recommendations on how to learn origami art immediately?\n\nA:\n\nAs with all crafts and arts, you can not expect to make beautiful items when you just start. You will have to start with the simple models and big sheets of paper. \nOnce you have some experience, you will go up to more difficult patterns and smaller paper.\nDepending on how you take to it, it might take days or weeks, but origami can be done beautiful with little experience when you work precise and with good paper.\nUsing a good book or a good website, cheap paper for your first few tries but nice paper for as soon as you are happy you can do the model. Depending on how you learn best, still pictures with how to fold, as in the books, or videos with fold along instructions will work. If you go for one style, try to get a site or person who has done more than just one or two, as while you are learning, following the same kind of instructions is often helpful. On the other hand, if you do not understand the instructions, other instructions for the same item may well help you.\nSome websites, (I have no connection with any, I learned my folding from age 4, well before internet was invented.)\nBeginners as well as more advanced.\nNot as easy but clear indication which models are not starter ones.\nYou can say that all sites that make you fold a crane as first item are over ambitious.\nI am out of the books, as the last one I purchased was 20 years back or so, but I know that if you go to a good bookshop, they should stock some. Look and read, buy a kid book if you can understand what the pictures instruct. You can go on to adult books after you have learned the basics.  \nThere are also many youtube channels and individual videos dedicated to origami. Again I would suggest to start with instructions aimed at children.  \nWhile the boxes or packages with nice paper seem quite expensive, you will find that one pack will last quite a few models.\nOne way to make bigger results of small and relatively simple origami is to put them together and make scenes, birthday cards or pictures. Or to go modular, where you make the same piece over and over and put them together.\nIf you dream of big and intricate figures you will need to keep improving on what you have learned, using bigger and more difficult models. But do start with baby steps, and keep improving step by step. If you try to go too difficult before you have the basics, you may give up well before you are good enough.\n\n"
