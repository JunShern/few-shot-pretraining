I don't know why.I like the name Esme but her personality always reminded me of a Charlotte.\n\nI don't know why these sort of things pop into my head. But it comes in handy to make up code names for the characters. When my friends and I talk TW around \"non-believers\" we don't look so weird because they don't recognize the names.\n\nSo when I first read Twilight I couldn't really see Bella as a Bella. But after a while I got used to it, and now I can't imagine her having another name. Though I wish Jasper's name would be different still, because Jasper is one of the dog catchers on 101 Dalmations. He should be William or something.\n\nTeam Edward&Esme~SBS Assistant 2 the Cobosses~APPCSt Cullens Head of Neurology~TetrarchNeed something to read? Tryhttp://www.jennacooper.com\n\nI would think that they would always keep the same first names and just change their last names as needed. I remember Edward saying that he was glad that his name fell out of favor with parents.Like others, I can't imagine them with any other names. To think of Rosalie as Carol just doesn't fit, I am glad that SM decided to change it.\n\n\"But you see, just because we've been...dealt a certain hand...it doesn't mean that we can't choose to rise above -- to conquer the boundaries of a destiny that none of us wanted.\"\n\nI think Renesmee is the silliest name ever. I mean noone can pronounce it, it doesnt roll off the tongue...in fact people call her nessie because its easier to pronounce instead. Its like if you named me JackDavid (as first name).\n\nSO I think that a good first name for her would be...anything normal! Here are a few hints:"
