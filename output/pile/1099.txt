    "text": "\nFirst photograph of light as both a particle and wave (2015) - ThomPete\nhttp://m.phys.org/news/2015-03-particle.html\n======\nmsimpson\nThis article is much more clear on what the image actually represents:\n[http://www.livescience.com/50019-image-light-wave-\nparticle.h...](http://www.livescience.com/50019-image-light-wave-\nparticle.html)\n\n\"A clever technique and an ultrafast electron microscope have caught an image\nof light behaving as both particle and wave at the same time. Here, the wave\nnature is demonstrated in the wavy upper portion, while the particle behavior\nis revealed below, in the outlines showing energy quantization.\"\n\nCredit: Fabrizio Carbone/EPFL\n\nAlso, this was all published on March 2, 2015.\n\n------\ndeckar01\nIt took me a few reads for this to sink in.\n\nQuantum interference causes standing waves. Electron-photon particle\ncollisions cause detectable energy release. The particle collisions occur in\nan interference pattern.\n\n~~~\nEarthIsHome\nYes, and the colors describe the speeds of the particles as a result of tbe\nelectron-photon collisions.\n\nIt's not necessarily the particles we're seeing, just the particle behaviors\nfrom their collisions.\n\n------\n_nalply\nSwiss here. The \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), where this\nexperiment has been carried out, is one of the two federal institutes of\ntechnology, the other one is the Eidgen\u00f6ssische Technische Hochschule Z\u00fcrich\n(ETHZ).\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_Polytechnique_F%C3%...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_Polytechnique_F%C3%A9d%C3%A9rale_de_Lausanne)\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETH_Zurich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETH_Zurich)\n\n------\nnsxwolf\nIt didn't explain the picture.\n\n~~~\nleksak\nYeah, I don't know how to interpret it. It's not immediately obvious to me\nthat I'm looking at a wave and particles at the same time.\n\n~~~\nURSpider94\nWhat the image represents is the energy loss/gain of a whole bunch of\nelectrons that interact one at a time with a light wave traveling along a tiny\nmetal wire (we call this kind of captive light wave a \"phonon\").\n\nFor each electron fired at the wire, it can either pass through unscathed, or\nit can interact with an electron and scatter off with a different energy, like\ntwo billiard balls hitting each other. The collision is fundamentally a\ncollision between two particles. However, the fact that the properties of the\ncollisions vary sinusoidally along the length of the wire imply that the\nphoton is also acting like a wave oscillating up and down the wire.\n\nI disagree that this is the \"first time\" that we've observed simultaneous\nwave-particle behavior, you can see the same thing by firing photons at two\nnarrowly-placed slits. This results in a diffraction pattern as if the photons\nwere interfering like waves, but we can confirm that we're detecting single\nphotons at the detector, and you can even confirm that each photon travels\nthrough one slit or the other ... See [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-\nslit_experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment)\n\n~~~\nAnimalMuppet\nOne nit: A phonon is a vibration of a lattice, not light.\n\n~~~\nURSpider94\nYep, that should have said \"plasmon\". I messed up all of my comments on this\nthread. A plasmon isn't technically light either, it's an oscillation of the\nelectric field in a conductor -- but it has wave/particle duality like a\nphoton.\n\n------\nemerongi\nIt's hard to grasp what was really captured on that image, but this still\ndoesn't rule out the pilot wave theory. I think it's misleading to call it a\nphotograph of light \"as both a particle and wave\".\n\n------\namelius\nI have a question about QM, which perhaps somebody here can answer: Is\nquantization an inherent property of the photon, or is it a property of the\nmaterial (or of the interaction with it)?\n\n~~~\nURSpider94\nThe other answers posted here are not quite right. Light energy is indeed\ninherently quantized, and a photon is one quantum of light. In other words,\nyou can't have a half-photon of light, only even multiples.\n\nEinstein wrote the equation \"E = h*(nu)\", where h is the so-called \"Planck's\nconstant\", and nu is the frequency of light. Translated, this means that each\nphoton carries an amount of energy proportional to its frequency, higher-\nfrequency photons (IR -> red -> blue -> UV -> X-ray) carry more energy.\n\ntl;dr: Quantization is an inherent property of light.\n\n~~~\namelius\n> E = h*(nu)\n\nYes, but the question is whether that is due to the material not being able to\nproduce non-quantized photons. Stated differently, suppose we had a different\nway of generating photons, then could we theoretically create them in a non-\nquantized way?\n\n~~~\nlisivka\nYep. They called \"radiowaves\".\n\n~~~\namelius\nSounds logical, but then again, how fundamental is the \"Q\" in \"QM\"?\n\n~~~\nlisivka\nExtremely. Broken quanta will release its energy. Check solitons (example:\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD32kkoFU3Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD32kkoFU3Y)\n). Soliton wave can cross ocean, but if you broke it pattern, you will have\nregular waves, not a half of solition.\n\n------\nshshhdhs\nThis is really cool! What's the reason for the blue & violet colors to be\nraised more than others in the wave?\n\nIs it just the timing of the snapshot? As in, another picture might show\nanother color at the top of the wave? Or is the standing wave \"stuck\" in that\nposition?\n\n~~~\nmdturnerphys\nThat's just the color scale they've used for the z axis.\n\n------\nmzs\n[https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-03/epfd-\ntfe0301...](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-03/epfd-\ntfe030115.php)\n\n------\nKoshkin\n> _an exchange of energy \"packets\" (quanta) between electrons and photons_\n\nI thought that photons _are_ the energy quanta (that electrons can _absorb_ or\nlose).\n\n------\nposterboy\nDarn the ambiguous english language, do they mean the photograph is a\nparticle-wave? because that wouldn't be a first. /s\n\n"
