    "text": "Editor\u2019s note: In November 2016, Consortiumnews.com was listed with about 200 other websites at the shadowy \u201cPropOrNot\u201d website, which was claiming to serve as a watchdog against undue \u201cRussian influence\u201d in the United States. The PropOrNot blacklist was elevated by the Washington Post as a credible source, despite the fact that the neo-McCarthyites who compiled the list hid behind a cloak of anonymity. As an article at Consortiumnews explained at the time, the Post granted PropOrNot anonymity \u201cto smear journalists who don\u2019t march in lockstep with official pronouncements from the State Department or some other impeccable fount of never-to-be-questioned truth.\u201d\n\nThe PropOrNot logo\n\nNow, George Eliason, an American journalist living in Ukraine, has published an article at Washington\u2019s Blog \u2013 one of the other 200 blacklisted websites \u2013 examining the cast of characters who may be behind the PropOrNot endeavor. As explained in a disclaimer at the original article at Washington\u2019s Blog: \u201cA leading cybersecurity expert has publicly said that Mr. Eliason\u2019s research as presented in this article does not violate the law. Washington\u2019s Blog does not express an opinion about whether or not the claims set forth in this article are accurate or not. Make up your own mind.\u201d\n\nBy George Eliason\n\nA little over a year ago, the deep state graced the world with PropOrNot. Thanks to them, 2017 became the year of fake news. Every news website and opinion column now had the potential to be linked to the Steele dossier and Trump collusion with Russia. Every journalist was either \u201cwith us or against us.\u201d Anyone who challenged the Russiagate narrative became Russia\u2019s trolls.\n\nFortunately for the free world, the anonymous group known as PropOrNot that tried to \u201cout\u201d every website as a potential Russian colluder, in the end only implicated themselves. Turnabout is fair play and that\u2019s always the fun part, isn\u2019t it? With that in mind, I know the dogs are going to howl this evening over this one.\n\nThe damage PropOrNot did to scores of news and opinions websites in late 2016-2017 provides the basis of a massive civil suit. I mean huge, as in the potential is there for a tobacco company-sized class-action sized lawsuit. I can say that because I know a lot about a number of entities that are involved and the enormous amount of money behind them.\n\nHow serious is this? In 2016, a $10,000 reward was put out for the identities of PropOrNot players. No one has claimed it yet, and now, I guess no one will. There are times in your life that taking a stand has a cost. To make sure the story gets out and is taken seriously, this is one of those times.\n\nIn this article, you\u2019ll meet some of the people staffing PropOrNot. You\u2019ll meet the people and publications that provide their expenses and cover the logistics. You\u2019ll meet a few of the deep state players. We\u2019ll deal with them very soon. They need to see this as the warning shot over the bow and start playing nice with regular people. After that, you\u2019ll meet the NGOs that are funding and orchestrating all of it. How am I doing so far?"
