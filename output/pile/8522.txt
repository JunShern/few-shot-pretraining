    "text": "Kagoshima Meibutsu (Local Specialities): Top 5 Foods!\n\nThinking of visiting Kagoshima? Make sure to try out these Kagoshima meibutsu!\n\n(1) Satsuma Age (\u85a9\u6469\u63da\u3052)\n\nSatsuma-age is a fried fishcake from Kagoshima, Japan. The paste is made from fish and seasoned with salt, sugar, and other spices and moulded into various shapes.\n\nWhile Kagoshima prefecture is famous for Satsuma Age, it was originally brought from Okinawa in 1864 when the two areas were hostile.\n\nThese days, however, the fishcake can be seen all over Japan. There\u2019s a good chance you will have seen them in instant soba noodles.\n\n(2) Shirokuma \u201cPolar Bear Shaved Ice\u201d(\u30b7\u30ed\u30af\u30de)\n\nKagoshima is Japan\u2019s most southernly prefecture bar Okinawa, so you can imagine has it has quite a warm climate. What better to keep cool than Kagoshima\u2019s famous shirokuma shaved ice. The icy dessert is served with fruit and sweets sprinkled on.\n\n(3) Silver-stripe herring sashimi (\u304d\u3073\u306a\u3054\u306e\u523a\u8eab)\n\nSashimi is raw fish that is often eaten with soy sauce and wasabi. Kagoshima is known for doing this with silver-stripe herring, a small white fish. Raw fish may put some of you off, but you really should try it before deciding.\n\n(4) Chicken Sashi (\u9ce5\u523a\u3057)\n\nYou\u2019re not mistaken, this really is raw chicken. You\u2019ve always been told to be careful when handling raw chicken, let alone trying to eat it, right? But in Kagoshima, people do.\n\nOf course, the chicken will have been specially taken care of to reduce salmonella to the lowest amount possible \u2013 but would you risk it?\n\nI have actually tried this, and well, I\u2019m not in any rush to try it again.\n\n(5) Pork Shabu (\u8c5a\u3057\u3083\u3076)\n\nYou may have heard of the Japanese cuisine known as \u2018shabu-shabu\u2019. Shabu-shabu is a Chinese-Japanese nabemono hotpot dish of thinly sliced meat and vegetables boiled in water. In Kagoshima, it is often done with pork instead of beef.\n\nThere are many restaurants that specialize in shabu-shabu all around Japan. While it isn\u2019t the cheapest gourmet, it\u2019s sure to be a great experience.\n\nThese are arguably the top 5 Kagoshima meibutsu, but how many do you want to try?"
