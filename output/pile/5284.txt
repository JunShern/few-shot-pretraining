    "text": "Tag Archives: E-Book\n\nA private corn field near Utica Illinois bisected by a country road at sunset\n\nA blog and You Tube channel sharing about culture, travel and a simple lifestyle.\n\nTraveling through Jamaica we drive fast when the roads cooperate, feeling the wind, and listening to the crickets singing the song of the universe.\n\nUltra smooth and new highway in Ohio early morning. Surreal feeling traveling on it almost like a sled in the sky.\n\nRural Road in Virginia adjacent to a field and wildlife refuge.\n\nMany Americans think of yoga as physical exercise, they know much of the practice involves a series of postures or \u201casanas\u201d and narrowly focus on using yoga to be fit, ignorant of the larger possibilities. The word \u201cyoga\u201d comes from the Sanskrit root \u201cyuj,\u201d which means \u201cto join\u201d or \u201cto yoke.\u201d The term was used to refer to the yoking together of horses and/or oxen but it came to mean the joining together of the body and mind for the purpose of seeking the divine (my personal interpretation and there are many). Yoga involves breathing and meditation techniques as well as the discipline of physical postures and flows. Many schools exist with different orientations aimed at optimizing health and well being as well as guiding the student to consciously progress in the spiritual life.\n\nMost of the seekers on the path to enlightenment acknowledge that this life is filled with the illusion of separation from the divine. Many spiritual disciplines aim to pierce the \u201cveil\u201d and bring us back \u201chome\u201d to our creator. We seek the literal \u201ckingdom of heaven on earth\u201d by embracing the great mystery and paradox that we must leave \u201chome\u201d or our own comfort zone to reunite with the essential self and shatter the illusions of the world. They say we forget the reality of our \u201ctrue\u201d \u2013 higher self, that we only remember in glimpses perhaps when we dream. The task of life is to remember, once again our true nature; to \u201cknow\u201d it in our day-to-day reality. To \u201chear\u201d this truth in the silent times that contain the seeds of all wisdom.\n\nTravel necessitates leaving \u201chome\u201d and like Odysseus and others who Joseph Campbell said embark on \u201cThe Hero\u2019s Journey\u201d we must sometimes leave one world behind to find another. We may seek pleasure, adventure, gain or employment but most must strike out on their own in this life in the process of individuation, survival and/or evolution.\n\nMy \u201cHero\u2019s Journey\u201d involves a new career in commercial truck driving. In parallel my heart\u2019s desire and gifts have led me to write an ebook for tourists to Jamaica with my partner, Fureus. Our book, Island Voices, Reggae and New Jamaican Music bridges culture and new music for the contemporary traveller.\n\nEither in the air or on the road we who are moving from place to place are warriors and of an independent and odd tribe. I was forced to leave home in search of employment and have become a combination monk and American cowboy as a professional driver/nomad. Seeking to get to Jamaica as often as possible I am facing many challenges and having to live very simply. I experience much austerity and, often the gifts of random kindness while observing a full spectrum of humanity unknown to soccer Moms, cubicle dwellers and suburban commuters.\n\nI practice yoga in my day to day life on the truck and maintain simple eating habits. I am grateful for fresh food and water when I get it. I discipline my body and especially my mind to maintain balance or otherwise be thrust into an emotional quicksand of sorts longing as I do for my home and missing the comforts of my lover, friends and animals.\n\nWriting this blog and sharing my journey through photos and in the future video on my You Tube channel is one way I make sense of the hardships I encounter daily. My sense of the beautiful has expanded this year and my sensibilities as an artist are changing as I hone into the essential. As Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry said in his great book, The Little Prince: \u201cAnd now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.\u201d\n\nIt is a mystery and another paradox that we photographers and artists seek always to express what is in our heart through our work. Visit this blog often to share my journey and in doing so the deepest recesses of my heart.\n\nIsland Voices Reggae & New Jamaican Music -an Ebook/Digital Music Guide for Tourists & Visitors to the Island.\n\nThe United States is experiencing the dead of winter, snow, ice and below freezing temperatures. For those who can escape, why not go to Jamaica and experience the blue, green island and the beautiful people there. When you go, take our book on your smartphone or digital reading tablet. It links to hundreds of songs, artists and websites that you can explore. Don\u2019t feel like a stranger \u2013 feel at home with the people and their culture through a love of the music. Reggae is education through music and each generation evolves the music further.\n\nIn addition, if you need a guide while you are there, I can hook you up with Fureus, a rap composer, producer and co-author of our book that can show you the secret, best places.\n\nClick on the link on the home page of this blog \u201cMy Book\u201d to buy the ebook. Call me or Fureus or email us from our book page. Happy Travels!\n\nShare this:\n\nI moved to California four weeks ago. I travel between here, Jamaica and Florida. I\u2019m lucky to have homes in both Duncans, Jamaica and Hobe Sound, Florida. Here in So Cal, I have an opportunity to spend time with my family and \u201creinvent myself\u201d while marketing my new e-book/digital music guide, written with Fureus, \u201cIsland Voices Reggae and New Jamaican Music.\u201d I\u2019m creating this site and blog to feature my portfolios and enable me to link to Pinterest and other social media in an integrated fashion independent of my consulting and publishing site, Universal Eye Media. I\u2019ll be writing about the adventure of marketing the book and sharing information for authors. As a devotee of digital publishing, I\u2019m building documents for the iPad and tablets that are really individual apps for people \u2013 articles or magazines that are personalized and specific. The pundits have talked a long time about \u201cmedia convergence\u201d but now it is truly happening as we can create apps and documents that combine video, websites, photography and writing into elegant and beautiful documents that are pieces of art. I\u2019ll be helping writers, artists, musicians and business people to forward their individual and personal goals with new media. I\u2019m connecting with lots of eclectic and electric people. Truly, the vibe and geography is different than the east coast. I\u2019m told the energy is conducive to innovation and open communication. So far it feels that way."
