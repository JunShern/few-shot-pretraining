Wayne Whitty is based in the Republic of Ireland.\nIf you wish to make a query about our personal data processing or if you wish to obtain information on the processing of your personal data, please use one of the contact options on our contact page.\n\nWhat personal information do we collect from the people that visit our app?\nWe do not keep a long-term record of personally identifiable information.\nOur app is built in such a way that storing your Facebook information in a database would be completely unnecessary.\nIf you have taken any of our quizzes in the past, then you can rest assured that we have not kept a database record of any of your personally identifiable information.\nThe only reason we would ever keep a record of your personally identifiable information is if we believe that your account activity is abnormal or you are suspected of violating our Terms of Service.\n\nThird-party disclosure.\nWe do NOT sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information. If you agree to provide us with access to your name, gender, etc, that information remains with LolSided.com and it is never transferred to a third-party.\n\nTemporary PII storage.\nAny personally identifiable information that is saved on our server is saved in a temporary session file that is automatically expired and removed within an hour of your session expiring.\nTo manually expire your session, you can click on the \"Log Out\" button in the top right-hand corner of our app.\nIf you forget to click on the \"Log Out\" button, your session data will be automatically expired and removed from our server after a short period of time.\nIf we cache your profile picture for performance reasons, that profile picture is saved and named in such a way that it is not linked to the rest of your personal information.\nIf we do cache your profile picture, it is for the sole intention of speeding up the time that it takes us to provide you with a quiz result.\nIf you do not share any of our results, cached profile pictures are automatically removed from our server within an hour after they have first been cached.\nIf you do share one of our results, your cached profile picture may be stored for roughly 45 days. This image is stored in such a way that it is not linked to your name or the rest of your personally identifiable information.\nIn certain cases, LolSided.com may log Facebook IDs, IP addresses or names for the purpose of generating statistics and identifying user behavior. These log files are temporary and are automatically deleted by our servers after a couple of days.\nIn the vast majority of cases, this data is automatically removed and compiled into non-identifying aggregate data every 60 seconds.\n\nHow do we use your information?\nWe use your information to provide you with personalized Facebook results.\nExample: By giving us access to your basic Facebook public profile information, you give us the ability to generate personalized quiz results that include your name, profile picture and gender-related pronouns.\n\nFacebook permissions.\nOur app abides by the Platform Policy for Facebook developers.\nOur app does not make any unnecessary requests for Facebook permissions.\nWe only request data and permissions that our app requires to generate results.\nIn most cases, we only ask for your basic profile information: This includes your Facebook profile ID, name, profile picture and gender.\nOn quizzes that involve a member of your friend list, we will ask for the friend list permission.\nWe do NOT ask for access to your interests, likes, timeline posts, photo albums or messages.\nFor more information on what Facebook information we request, please see our article on Facebook Permissions.\n\nDo we use cookies?\nYes.
