    "text": "News and Reviews from the Education Library Service\n\nCILIP Carnegie Medal and Kate Greenaway Prize 2014\n\nOn Monday afternoon the winners of the 2014 CILIP Carnegie Medal and Kate Greenaway Prize were announced, delivered to Kevin Brooks\u2019 \u2018The Bunker Diary\u2019 and Jon Klassen\u2019s \u2018This Is Not My Hat\u2019 respectively. While the latter seemed an almost logical choice- an illustrator whose work is greatly loved in our office- the awarding of the top prize to Kevin Brooks has been controversial, with the win garnering much attention in the national press. Much of the debate has surrounded the book\u2019s gritty content and indeed its suitability in a text aimed at a young audience. That said, many of the nominated titles this year seemed to have a dark undertone, with perhaps \u2018Liar & Spy\u2019 and \u2018Rooftoppers\u2019 falling outside of this bracket.\n\nThe \u201cdarkness\u201d of the shortlist was an issue raised at the shadowing session we attended on Monday morning. Taking place in the wonderful library at Litcham School, a group of year 9 students were joined by visiting pupils from Long Stratton High, all of whom had taken part in the shadowing scheme this year. After a brief quiz in which they were tested on their knowledge of the books selected for this year\u2019s lists, the students were put into small groups and each of the titles were discussed. We were so impressed with the quality of their responses and the students had evidently thought hard about why they liked (or indeed, disliked!) each of the books.\n\nThe content of discussion was vast and ranged from how misleading a book cover can often be (in particular, the variations between the paperback and hardback covers of \u2018The Child\u2019s Elephant\u2019) to the significance of centering a story around real life social, political and cultural history (\u2018Ghost Hawk\u2019 and \u2018The Wall\u2019). The students\u2019 impassioned reactions were brilliant to see and hear and we\u2019d like to thank the pupils of Litcham School and Long Stratton High for sharing with us their thoughts!\n\nTo mirror the real announcements taking place in London, the students each cast a vote on which of the titles they would pick to win and the results were as follows:\n\nThe Wall by William Sutcliffe: 5 votes\n\nRooftoppers by Katherine Rundell: 4 votes\n\nThe Bunker Diary by Kevin Brooks: 3 votes\n\nAll The Truth That\u2019s In Me by Julie Berry: 2 votes\n\nThe Child\u2019s Elephant by Rachel Campbell-Johnston: 2 votes\n\nBlood Family by Anne Fine: 2 votes\n\nGhost Hawk by Susan Cooper: 1 vote\n\nLiar & Spy by Rebecca Stead: 0 votes\n\nWe were pleasantly surprised to see \u2018The Wall\u2019 come out on top and were even more impressed with how many of the students present mentioned the way in which the story had made them want to familiarise themselves further with the Israeli-Palestine conflict on which the story is based. The results of our poll were also interesting when compared to how we in the office had ranked the books: Julie Berry\u2019s \u2018All The Truth That\u2019s In Me\u2019 was our favourite to win, with \u2018The Bunker Diary\u2019 largely disliked.\n\nThe groups of students also looked at the Kate Greenaway titles and the vote for this was unanimous: \u2018The Day the Crayons Quit\u2019 by Drew Daywalt and Oliver Jeffers! However it was agreed that Jon Klassen\u2019s work in both the Lemony Snickett collaboration \u2018The Dark\u2019 and in his own right (\u2018This Is Not My Hat\u2019) would be worthy of any award, so his win came as no surprise!\n\nOverall, we had such a wonderful morning and are already looking toward next year\u2019s awards: what\u2019s next for Carnegie?\n\nBelow are extracts from two of the reviews written by students from Litcham- we thought they were so great that they deserved to be shared!\n\nOf Anne Fine\u2019s \u2018Blood Family\u2019, Hannah wrote:\n\n\u2018Despite the depressing subject matter, I really enjoyed Blood Family because I felt the storyline was very true to life and believable. This tale of an adopted child in a caring family made me realise how hard it is to live life to the full when you have a looming shadow of your horrific past hovering over you day and night.\n\nI thought the book well written and easy to read and I couldn\u2019t put it down. I particularly like the way the story was written from the perspective of different people so you can see how Eddie\u2019s life and traumas impact on other people\u2019s lives, and how they perceive what is going on.\u2019\n\nOn \u2018The Wall\u2019, Eleanor wrote:\n\n\u2018I found it both an adventurous and thrilling book. I thought it had an original story line and I liked the fact that it is based on something that us really happening now and so combines fact with fiction. I\u2019ve learnt a lot from reading this book on a subject I didn\u2019t know a lot about.\n\nI loved the fact that the story is written through the innocent eyes of thirteen year old Joshua. I liked him as a character because he wasn\u2019t afraid to stand up for what he thought was right and to help other people who he was told didn\u2019t deserve it. he matured through the book from a boy who was kept in the dark to a man who wasn\u2019t afraid to make his own decisions.\u2019\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this year\u2019s winners? We\u2019d love to know- we can\u2019t stop talking about here!\n\nOne thought on \u201cCILIP Carnegie Medal and Kate Greenaway Prize 2014\u201d\n\n[\u2026] As a reminder, the shortlist can be found here and we also recommend having a look at the shadowing site on which schools and reading groups across the country have been sharing what they think of the nominated books. We\u2019ll be hosting a special event on the day the winner will be announced (22nd June!) and we look forward to sharing what the pupils discussed at our meeting. You can find a round-up of our 2014 shadowing morning here. [\u2026]"
