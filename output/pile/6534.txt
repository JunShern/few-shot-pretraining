with us.\" \"Linderman requested a meeting at the casino tonight.\" \" Any guesses why ?\" \" I'm four points behind.\" \"He's going to tell me how he plans to put me ahead and what he's expecting of me after I win.\" \"We were thinking the same thing, and we want you to record it.\" \"You want me to wear a wire ?\" \"You're the only one on our side who can get enough incriminating evidence to put him behind bars.\" \"We need this Mr. Petrelli, and so do you.\" \"Otherwise, he walks.\" \"We'll contact you when you land in Vegas.\" \"How long have you been working with the f.B.I.?\" \"Since

is not the time for you to get noble, okay.\" \"Just stay with me.\" \"I can't.\" \"I can't.\" \"As long as I'm alive, everyone around me is in danger.\" \"Suresh.\" \"We can call Suresh, okay ?\"

me.\" \" Sorry.\" \"I have to take a trip.\" \" Now ?\" \" What else ?\" \"You stay here and take care of Lyle.\" \"I'll be back as soon as I can.\" \" If anyone comes looking for me\" \" Stop.\"

memory.\" \"You took me in the shower.\" \"You told me everything.\" \" I told you ?\" \" What you really do.\" \"Who you work for, and what happened to Claire.\" \"Do you know where she is ?\" \" You know I can't remember.\" \" No.\" \"But you told me you were protecting her.\" \"You said you sent her away so she'd be safe, and that if you went after her,\" \"I should give you this.\" \"Claire is with friends don't go after her.\" \"This is my writing !\" \"Okay, look.\" \"We can't let anybody know about this.\" \"Don't worry.\" \"I know how to play dumb.\" \"I can never love you enough.\" \"You do fine.\" \"Puccini ?\" \"I thought of you more as a John Denver type.\" \"That's your wife ?\" \"Your painter friend from new york has trying to reach you.\" \"I chatted with him for you.\"

\"Although, I haven't figured out what it he's looking for.\" \"Specific gene, codon.\" \"There are 3 billion options base per human DNA.\" \"It's the proverbial needle.\" \" Did my DNA helped ?\" \" No.\" \"Okay Mohinder, you've been driving all night.\" \" Why you just don't take a break.\" \" I can't.\" \"These people are in danger.\" \"We have to warn them.\" \"If Sylar gets to them first--.\" \"Exactly.\" \"So let me help.\" \"Right here.\" \"This one is in New York.\" \"Isaac Mendez.\" \"I'll call him.\" \"And you just relax and take a minute.\" \"You're very kind.\" \"Thank you.\" \"You have no idea how alone I used to feel.\" \"How insignificant.\" \"You've given me hope.\" \"Hope is great.\" \"We need cafeine.\" \"So this formula, if you figure it out how many of us will you find?\" \"Who knows?\" \"Hundreds, thousands, maybe more.\" \"It's busy.\" \"I'll get him later.\" \"To new friends.\" \"This is good.\" \"What is it?\" \"Chi.\" \"It's a special blend my father brought from India.\" \"Who we gonna call next ?\" \"No one.\" \"I already have you.\" \"Mr. Sylar.\" \"Here.\" \"Mr. Petrelli ?\" \" Flying man!\" \" Not here.\" \" Flying man !\" \" Yeah.\" \"Let me guess.\" \"You're still trying to still that sword from Mr. Linderman?\" \" Where is your friend ?\" \" Ando ?\" \"I sent him back to Japan.\" \"This mission getting too dangerous for him.\" \"I think I know what you mean.\" \"Can't protect everyone.\" \"Sometimes it's better to go it alone.\" \"The more people you try and help, the more people get hurt.\" \"Please, you must help me.\" \"I can't get past the casino security.\" \"When I first met you, I thought you were nuts.\" \"It's okay.\" \"I thought you were mean.\" \"But know you know, you pretend you do not care about anyone, but you care too much.\" \"It's really important you get your powers back, huh ?\" \"It is important for everyone.\" \"Follow me.\" \"You know who I am ?\" \"Of course.\" \"Mr. Petrelli.\" \"My friend is making a delivery for me to Mr. Linderman, something he's expected.\" \"I didn't realize...\" \"I think you've been around long enough to know what happens when Mr. Linderman doesn't get what he's expecting.\" \"Or do I have to paint you a picture.\" \"You can take it to the curator.\" \"That work for you?\" \"Vivian Louis ?\" \"My name is Vivian and I'm from Canada.\" \"Are you kidding me ?\" \"I do not need you happy, only safe.\" \"There's nothing left of me.\" \"Everything I have will disappear the second I get on the plane.\" \"My friends, my family.\" \"Me.\" \"I can make you forget it all, if that's what you'd prefer.\" \"There's nothing left for you here.\" \"No one to trust.\" \"No.\" \"You cannot see him again.\" \"Peter Petrelli is the only person I know that I can trust.\" \"More than you.\" \"He cares about me.\" \"Why can't I hide in New York with him ?\" \"He's not in a position to be responsible for you or himself.\" \"Come.\" \"Boarding pass and I.D.\" \"Boarding pass and I.D.\" \"Boarding pass and I.D.\" \"Sorry, sir, only passengers are allowed beyond this floor.\" \"Isaac Mendez, NYPD.\" \"We have a few questions for you.\" \"Mr. Mendez, detective Jeff Tracy, NYPD.\" \"Do you know this woman ?\" \"Simone Deveau ?\" \"She and I...\" \"We broke up recently.\" \"We received a phone call that she might be hurt.\" \"Some of your neighbours said they heard an argument then gunshots.\" \"Might if we take a look around ?\" \"Isaac.\" \"What's going on ?\" \"Something wrong ?\" \"No, ma'am.\" \"Apparently not.\" \"Sorry for taking your time.\" \"Simone, you're alive.\" \"Lucky you.\" \"My.\" \"You're very usefull.\" \"Candace is special, just like you.\" \"Where's Simone ?\" \"She's traveling Europe, indefinitely.\" \"As far as the rest of the world is concerned.\" \"There's a crew going to clean up this mess.\" \"How am I supposed to pretend this didn't happen ?\" \"Maybe you should have thought about that before you shot her, twice.\" \"What's the matter, sweetie, you wanna shoot me again ?\" \"Enough.\" \"I can't stay here.\" \" Take me with you.\" \" That's not our assignment.\" \"Please.\" \" I don't know what to do.\" \" Of course you do.\" \"You keep painting.\" \"My condolescences.\" \"There you go.\" \" When did you get so good ?\" \" I'm unemployed.\" \"What do you this I do all day when you're at school ?\" \"

have to admit it, Nikki,\" \"I do a better you than you.\" \"Did you think I wouldn't find out ?\" \"About what ?\" \" Where did you get that ?\" \" It was on my pillow.\" \"Well, I didn't put it there.\" \"Were you digging through my stuff ?\" \"Don't turn this around on me, Nikki.\" \"You said no more secrets.\" \"I found out you're going to Linderman's casino.\" \"For what ?\" \" What did you got doing with this guy ?\" \" It's nothing.\" \"Linderman called and he asked me to be his dealer, that's it.\" \"You're not talking about dealing cards here.\" \"That's all this is.\" \"Baby

induces paralysis of the brain.\" \"Which means you can't control your abilities.\" \"Whoever you think I am, I'm not.\" \"You are the man who murdered my father !\" \"Do you still expect me to believe you're Zane Taylor ?\" \"Zane was killed three days ago, the same day I met you.\" \"You thought you were so clever, giving me his DNA.\" \"You're a parasite.\" \"You killed my father and fed off his work.\" \"Let me here you say it.\" \"Tell me your name.\" \"Say it !\" \"Say it !\" \"Sylar !\" \"There's only one thing to do with a parasite.\" \"Kill it before it kills again.\" \"You're just like your father, murderers the both of you.\" \"I'm a scientist.\" \"Your father said that.\" \"But he kept bleeding me through--.\" \"He had no idea what you were.\" \"He knew.\" \"He might not have admitted it, but after all, we were making so much progress together, why would he stop?\" \"You know nothing about my father.\" \"I know everything.\" \"He confided in me.\" \"He told me things he felt he could never tell you.\" \"Things about your sister, Shanti.\" \"He thought you were too-- what's the word ?\" \"Fragile to know the truth.\" \"That why he let me.\" \"You were always seeking his approval.\" \"I provided stimulation and he gave up on you, but adored me.\" \"Who is the real parasite here ?\" \"You're right.\" \"My father did want answers.\" \"He called you patient 0.\" \"You were the template he used to create this formula.\" \"You're the key to unlocking its secret.\" \"As much as I'd like to, killing you will not give me what I need.\" \"So what are you going to do ?\" \"I'm going to take a sample of your spinal fluid, and it's going to hurt !\" \"You can at least do some good before you die.\" \"There are so few dead sea fragments left in the world, it would be a pity if you crushed this one.\" \"So many things.\" \"You brought the new Mendez ?\" \"This one is very special.\" \"This painting is ripped.\" \"And repaired with a scotch tape.\" \"Yes.\" \"Very special.\" \"Is there something else?\" \"I... need the \"shito\" for \"tiribari\".\" \"Sword, Kensei.\" \"I found you.\" \"There are 754 members of the security team in this hotel, all of them with the instructions to drop what they're doing and come running if I push this button.\" \"Code 5.\" \"Activated.\" \"The sword you thought you'd steal, do you even realize what who you thought it belonged to ?\" \"Akeizo Kensei.\" \"He was a hero.\" \"Security, sir.\" \"This man tried to steal from Mr. Linderman.\" \"Ando !\" \"How did you...\" \"I knew you'd set off an alarm eventually.\" \"I've been following you.\" \"What about the other 753 members of security?\" \"The guy says Linderman's gonna be here.\" \"Asking for me in about an hour.\" \"I'm not in the mood for craps so I'm going straight to my room.\" \"I gues it's hard to act natural when you are going after the whale.\" \"Maybe he'll chat up a few more japanese tourists.\" \"Where it hell is that pizza?\" \"Hi, agent Alonzo, Casada.\" \"Mr. Linderman sends his regards.\" \"And a suggestion.\" \"Don't run surveillance from inside a man's own hotel.\" \"It's very tacky.\" \"Kick over your guns.\" \"Down.\" \"So much easier working with professionals.\" \"I finally found it.\" \"That's it, the four simple genes answer everything.\" \"I can make a new list, I can find them, save them.\" \"And what about me ?\" \"Don't I deserve to be saved ?\" \"Aren't I just a victim too ?\" \"I didn't ask for this.\" \"And what would you have me do ?\" \"Help find a way to give me salvation.\" \"Give me that damn list so I can see my teeth in.\" \"I'm a natural progressively species.\" \"Evolution is a part of nature.\" \"And nature skill kills simple.\" \"Right ?\" \"What you have done is not evolution, it's murder.\" \"What I am doing is revenge.\" \"Now I can fulfill my duty as a son.\" \"I wasn't begging for my life.\" \"I was offering you yours.\" \"You are your father's son.\" \"So determined you didn't even noticed I stopped the IV.\" \"Don't worry.\" \"You might actually do some good before you die.\" \"Starting with that list.\" \"I'm back in my room.\" \"I'll be on the floor in an hour.\" \"Wearing this could get a person killed.\" \"Okay, sorry.\" \"Easy\" \"Listen to me.\" \"I don't know how much time we have before she comes back.\" \" Who ?\" \" Jessica.\" \"The woman they sent after you.\" \" You pick the wrong day to screw with me.\" \" Linderman knows about the wire and the F.B.I.\" \"The F.B.I. can hear everything we're saying.\" \"No.\" \"They can't.\" \"They're dead.\" \"Linderman knows you turned on him.\" \"Did you come here to kill me or warn me?\" \"Just trust me.\" \"Well, you're back early.\" \"Hey, good news.\" \"I convinced the hotel to let us keep Mr. Muggles in the room.\" \"That is good news.\" \"I've been going out of my head, thinking everybody is watching me, waiting for me to make a mistake\" \" did you find her ?\" \" I can't do that.\" \"If I know where she is, they can extract it from me.\" \"I need you to be strong a little while longer.\" \"We both have to pretend that we have no idea what happened so Claire will be safe.\" \" But the company...\" \" Has to be stopped for good.\" \"That's the only way to make sure that Claire will stay safe.\" \"I didn't know that I could talk to you like this.\" \"I always just thought that you be so furious at me for all the lies and deceipts.\" \"Right now we just have to take care of Claire.\" \"We'll talk about us later.\" \"Must be the kennel.\" \"Hello.\" \"Yes, it is.\" \"Yes.\" \"He is going to be a problem.\" \"Why don't we do it right now ?\" \"Sorry.\" \"I did it !\" \"Don't worry about me... you must go !\" \"You have the sword.\" \" You can teleport out of here.\" \" No.\" \" Come, we both go.\" \" Both ?\" \"Oh no.\" \"This looks like...\" \"What happened ?\" \"It's the future.\" \"The bomb.\" \"We didn't stop it.\" \"I failed.\" \"I am sorry.\" \"I hope I have the right address.\" \"I'm looking for Peter Petrelli.\" \"You picked a terrible time to do that.\" \"Peter is not here just now.\" \"You may as well come inside, Claire.\" \"Who are you ?\" \"I'm your grandmother, and I've been trying to protect you, but you haven't made that very easy.\" \"Quite stubborn, aren't you ?\" \"Just like your father.\" \"Linderman hired her to kill the F.B.I. and keep you in line.\" \"Who ?\" \"Let's just say I owe her.\" \"He's going to offer you a deal.\" \"If you go in there, you have to take it.\" \"Spend the rest of my life with his boot on my neck,\" \" no thank you.\" \" Then run.\" \"Get your family and run.\" \"You said you had kids.\" \"Two boys ?\" \"I can't do that.\" \" You don't have any other option.\" \" Yeah.\" \"I do.\" \"I could kill him.\" \" Knock me out.\" \" Why ?\" \"So Jessica knows she's not in control anymore.\" \" Who is Jessica ?\" \" You want this gun ?\" \"Do it.\" \"Not up there.\" \"Mr. Linderman won't be meeting you in his office.\" \"Mr. Linderman ?\" \"Do you enjoy vegetables, Mr. Petrelli ?\" \"I've been known to eat sukini when the mood strikes but not as a rule.\" \"You could probably hire someone to do that for you.\" \"Oh, yeah.\" \"I like to cook.\" \"It's my meditation.\" \"One aims for perfection in one's life, but one doesn't find it very often.\" \"For me, this is about as close it it gets.\" \"Voila.\" \"A pot pie.\" \"Wholesome, harm, healthy.\" \"That's of course if you can live without the cream sauce, personally, I can't.\" \"I mean, what's the point?\" \"You know, people can sleep or they can gamble or they can even make love when they're miserable.\" \"But I think that most people eat when they're happy.\" \"I like to see people happy.\" \"Are you happy, Nathan ?\" \"Not especially.\" \"I guess I have a few issues that plague me.\" \"Oh, dear.\" \"Sorry to hear that.\" \"You see, I think there comes a time when a man as to ask himself whether he wants a life of happiness or a life of meaning.\" \" I'd like to have both.\" \" Can't be done.\" \"Two very different paths.\" \"I mean, to be truly happy, a man must live absolutely in the present.\" \"No thought of what's gone before and no thought of what lies ahead.\" \"But a life of meaning, a man is condemned to wallow in the past and obsess about the future.\" \"My guess is that you have done quite a bit of obsessing about yours these last few days.\" \"Now, you can't have any of my pot pie.\" \"I want hold it against you.\" \"Lots of men have tried to kill me.\" \"And I'll be the last.\" \"Of course you can pull that trigger Nathan.\" \"You'll be taking both of our lives.\" \"You'll be dead within moments.\" \"Or I could offer you something.\" \"I'm not interested in anything you have to offer me.\" \"I think you are.\" \"I think there are things you need to hear.\" \" Things that I know about.\" \" Too late for that.\" \"But you can fly, for instance ?\" \"Or about your brother, Peter ?\" \"Huh ?\" \"And his small problem.\" \"Your daughter, even.\" \"Or those others out there like you.\" \"I can offer you more than just information Nathan.\" \"You're going to win your election, I'll see to that.\" \"And two years from now, through a series of fluke circumstances you will find yourself in the white house, a heartbeat away from the presidency.\" \"A life of meaning, Nathan.\" \"Think about it.\" \"The choice is yours.\" \"Suresh ?\" \"Suresh ?\" \"It's Peter Petrelli.\" \"Mohinder ?\" \"Sylar.\" \"I remember you.\" \"You're like me, aren't you ?\" \"I'd like to see how that works.\" \"No !\" \"Thanks to Raceman for the Transcript Subtitles Made By The Bloc Team\""
