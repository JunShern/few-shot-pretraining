    "text": "In a shot ball game machine, such as a pachinko machine, predetermined game parts including a starting means, a pattern display means, and a big prize means are mounted in the game region of a game board. In playing a game, game balls are shot to the game region by shooting means. And, if a game ball is detected by the starting means, under the condition of this detection a plurality of patterns in the pattern display means are varied for a predetermined time, and whether a special game state is to be generated or not is decided on the basis of a random number obtained under the condition of this variation. If there is a decision to the effect that the special game state should be generated, a patterns after the variation is stopped in a particular manner, whereupon the special game state to open the opening/closing plate of the big prize means is generated. The big prize means closes the opening/closing plate when a predetermined time has passed since the opening or when a predetermined number of game balls win prizes during the opening. Further, under the condition that game balls pass through the particular region, the special game state, that is, the opening of the big prize means, is repeated predetermined times at a maximum.\nGame moves taking place in the game board, including lottery or the like to decide whether or not such special game state is to be generated, are controlled by a main control circuit board stored in a main circuit board case on the back of the game machine main body. Therefore, if predetermined electronic parts including ROMs on the main control circuit board are dishonestly replaced by those which provide a higher probability of generation of the special game state or the like, the special game state can be easily generated.\nAccordingly, the method heretofore employed is such that as the predetermined electronic parts including ROMs, those having intrinsic identification information, such as a serial number, applied thereto are used on the one hand and on the other hand after the main control circuit board having the predetermined electronic parts mounted thereon has been stored in the main circuit board case, the latter is sealed by a sealing means which, when opened, will leave a trace of opening. Thereby, if such sealing means are inspected in game parlors or the like, the presence or absence of a dishonest act can be decided, e.g., by the presence or absence of a trace of opening the sealing means, or by a difference in the intrinsic identification information on the electronic parts.\nIn assembling a pachinko machine or the like provided with a circuit board case disposed on the back of the game machine main body and having such main control circuit board stored therein, it is necessary for game machine makers to confirm and record the intrinsic identification information on the electronic parts and to reliably seal the main circuit board case by the sealing means.\nIn the prior art, however, since the intrinsic identification information on the electronic parts and the sealing state of the sealing means are visually confirmed by the operator in the inspection step subsequent to the assembling of a pachinko machine, there is a danger of omission of inspection or the like to overlook the state of the sealing means despite the fact that the sealing means has not sealed.\nFurther, in the case of confirming the intrinsic identification information on the electronic parts prior to sealing the main circuit board case and then sealing the main circuit board case by the sealing means, it cannot be absolutely denied that between the confirmation of the intrinsic identification information on the electronic parts and the sealing of the main circuit board case, there is a dishonest act, e.g., to open the main circuit board case to replace the main control circuit board by a new one and to let the latter read a dishonest intrinsic identification information.\nWith these prior art problems in mind, the invention has for its object the provision of a game machine circuit board case inspection method, and a game board or game machine inspection method, which are capable of reliably effecting the reading of intrinsic identification information applied to electronic parts on a control circuit board in a circuit board case and confirming the sealed state of a circuit board case and also capable of preventing a dishonest act, e.g., to replace electronic parts and let them read dishonest intrinsic identification information in an inspection step."
