    "text": "The Magic Formula Fallacy\n\nJust because it works inside your head, doesn\u2019t mean it actually works\n\nIt seems to be a staple of geek (or non-geek come to that) politics. The Magic Formula.\n\n\u2013 \u201cIf we lower taxes on the wealthy, the country will become richer, because the wealthy create wealth\u201d\n\u2013 \u201cIf we execute murderers, it will reduce murder, because that\u2019s one less murderer off the streets\u201d\n\u2013 \u201cIf we legalise pot, drug use will go up, because pot is a gateway drug\u201d\n\u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s ok to torture people because if there\u2019s a ticking bomb like on TV, it might save lives\u201d\n\u2013 \u201cAnyone who works hard can become rich\u201d\n\nSome are obviously less based-on-lies than others. Some are true \u2013 but only within a limited perspective, outside of which they become a lie. eg: \u201cAnyone who works hard can become rich\u201d \u2013 yup, but that\u2019s not the point. The point is that the system is set up so most people don\u2019t become rich regardless of how hard they work. Rags to Riches stories are not the basis of sound social or economic policy.\n\nAnyway \u2013 Magic Formulas. For geeks it seems to be Libertarianism\u2026 particularly American Geeks. Geeks love Game-Theory. Geeks don\u2019t like having to deal with what actual people actually do. Libertarianism a web 2.0-era computer-programmer attempt to \u201cwrite\u201d a utopianism program. It\u2019s like distributed Das Kapital for people who\u2019s only foray outside the sphere of cable tv, is internet chat rooms.\n\nLibertarianism is a classic Magic Formula. All theory; No evidence.\n\nIn fact it isn\u2019t even a theory because it isn\u2019t falsifiable.\nIn fact it isn\u2019t even an hypothesis because it\u2019s not based on observation.\n\nIt\u2019s a magic formula.\n\nThe Austrian School specifically ignores empirical evidence (look it up), so no pesky reality need get in the way\u2026 which is handy, because I\u2019ve yet to see a single case of libertarianism actually working anywhere. You can see a gradient in fact: the better the social-spending; the better off, and happier the people. Tax is not fucking theft. Tax is us, thinking in terms of \u201cUs\u201d rather than \u201cMe\u201d. If you look at evidence, what you see is that the opposite of libertarianism seems to work best.\n\nThe fact that the government has become corrupted by corporate money, doesn\u2019t mean that liberal, secular democracies, with an easily measurable, transparent balance of taxation, don\u2019t produce the best results that we\u2019ve ever seen in the whole of recorded human history. They do.\n\nLibertarianism is a magic formula who\u2019s basic fallacy comes down to the idea that \u201cpeople are individuals\u201d, when actually, on the whole, they\u2019re not.\n\nClay Shirky gave us an example of this in one of his talks\u2026 parents picking their kids up from school, some would turn up late \u2013 so somebody thought it would be a good idea to issue a small fine. That\u2019s the magic formula. \u201cIf you financially penalise someone for a behaviour, the behaviour will decline\u201d. Unbeatable\u2026 in the tiny mind of the person who\u2019s idea it was. What actually happened was that \u201cthe fine\u201d became the price of being late, which was easier for people to pay, than breaking the unspoken social contract they had before, so lateness increased. Unfortunately, when they tried to put things back the way they were before, it made no difference. The social contract once broken, stayed broken.\n\nSo what have we got? We\u2019ve got a million different laws based on magic formulas (you have to be a lawyer to understand them all)\u2026 we\u2019ve got a whole ecosystem of discourse that is only allowed (by the broadcast media) to take place within the frameworks of magic formulas\u2026 and we\u2019ve got well-meaning people, including geeks (who are scientists, so should really know better) providing \u201csolutions\u201d that are all magic formulas.\n\nAll conservative political policy is based on Magic Formulas.\n\n\u2014\n\nJust because it works inside your head, doesn\u2019t mean it actually works.\nJust because it works inside your head, doesn\u2019t mean it actually works.\nJust because it works inside your head, doesn\u2019t mean it actually works.\n\nHere\u2019s an idea: If a theory isn\u2019t falsifiable, then it shouldn\u2019t be part of any policy conversation.\n\nPolicy without evidence needs to be recognised as being speculative \u2013 and experiment is great, we should definitely experiment\u2026 but policy without evidence needs to be stamped \u201cSPECULATIVE\u201d with a specific expiration-date built into it, so it is rolled back if it fails to meet specific measurable goals. And to minimise the damage that speculative policy can do, it should be conducted on a small scale, with specific focus given to The Amsterdam Effect*.\n\n\u2014\n\nNever talk about \u201cbelief\u201d \u2013 just show us the data. Show us your methodology for collecting it. Leave the interpretation to us.\n\nThanks.\n\n*The Amsterdam Effect is what happens when an experiment is not carried out in isolation \u2013 when your neighbours swamp your results. A similar thing happens in Estonia \u2013 who\u2019s relative prosperity is not because of their flat-tax rate, but because of their flat-tax rate AND their proximity to Scandinavia.\n\nStats are stats \u2013 it\u2019s an imperfect science\u2026 but at least the simple act of trying to measure something shifts the emphasis from \u201cwhat should happen\u201d to \u201cwhat does happen\u201d.\n\nMind you, if you\u2019re talking about social-policy, then the simple act of measuring can have a fairly profound affect on what actually happens. New Labour\u2019s fascination with measuring the fuck out of everything that happens in education was possibly not such a great idea. It basically meant that parents could see which schools produced the best results, which pushed house-prices up in those areas, which effectively created a class-system based on wealth, which was the opposite of what labour should have been about.\n\nEducation is subtle and tricky. Crime, economics etc etc, not so much.\n\nMeasuring means learning from measuring but economics and politics are intertwined and economics is no science (hence you have to go to Norway to receive a Nobel price in Ecomics while the real sciences go to Sweden). It is more of a religion.\n\nThey do measure the crap out of every \u201ceconomic parameter\u201d known to men and perform some really nifty algorithms in order to evaluate risk for instance (using Black Scholes which is not that much more, then a complex Monte Carlo analysis) but the then forget that Mr. Sholes hedgefund which was based on these principles tanked in 1998 (only a 4.8 billion write-off, what are we talking about). So in 2007 I had to test software based on these functions:\n\nand in order to test the software I needed something to test against, so I created a Excel sheet in order to do that (integrating the Monte Carlo tables into the sheet). Now I also knew the limitations of the model full well. It uses market data and these do not take into account the full spectrum of all the possible market moves. Outside the spectrum risks are never taken into account. So if something out of the ordinary happens (like when the East Asian markets crash), option holders are exposed to much more risk then they would like resulting in even more catastrophic faillures, because of rash moves (of men and machine these days).\n\nAnd thats is only one of the problems. What these people basicly do is to treat people as if they behaved like brownian body\u2019s, which have no notion about their surroundings and bump into each other in a compleetly stochastic manner. But people do not behave like brownian bodies. People behave like birds, insects or fish in a swarm. No one controls the swarm but it creates a pattern of its own, due to the fact that individual particles of the swarm react to each other in predictable ways (keeping closeness and distance as constant as possible and all thriving to be as the center of the swarm) and transfer this reaction on other parts of the swarm. Unpredictability is introduced due to the fact that these reactions are never perfect (if only due to the fact that not all particles can be at the middle of the flock). Swarm mentality can be very volatile. A small input (like a hawk appearing on the horizon) can cause small reaction in a few birds and the swarm can change its general course in an instant, thus taking birds out of the danger zone that themselves have never seen the hawk. So a small input gets amplified due to the herd behaviour. In a brownian system this would never happen. A brownian system would absorb the input and distribute it like a ripple in a pond.\n\nEconomists should take their time of and study swarm and heard behaviour and learn to includes these into their models.\n\nAh, and the trickle down economics part of Mr. Milton Friedman is explained to the general voter via this little (stupid) comparison.\n\n\u201cIf water rises in a harbor the big boats and the little boats rise alike\u201d\n\nNow any skipper who has put his boat in a natural tidal harbor knows that is only true from the time that there is enough water to float all the boats to begin with. In a tidal harbor boats get lifted out of the water one by one and guess what mr. Friedman, the small boats float first and the big ones later (needing more water to float). So in an economy were their isn\u2019t an unlimited supply of money (water) small can be better then big. Only when you make a channel for the big boats (and thus steal the small boats water), big boats float earlier but then the small boats rest on the mudflats untill a spring tide (or an economic bubble) comes along\u2026\u2026but spring tides usually disappear as fast as they came\u2026\u2026\u2026now that is what happens exactly in the neo-con economical model. All it\u2019s parameters are skewed in order to steal the water from the small boats. Tax cuts for bigger companies resulting in big companies being able to evade taxes (legally). Outsorcing benifits big companies more then small ones. More advertising potential and so on, and so on. The list is endless.\n\nSorry \u2013 can\u2019t tell if you\u2019re being sarcastic or not\u2026 but anyone who talks about \u201cThe Liberal Agenda\u201d is probably someone who watches quite a lot of Fox News.\n\nBut\u2026 if we were to look at gun control from an evidence-based POV,\n\nWhat measurable results do you want out of gun law?\n\nWhat other countries achieve those results? What are their laws? Has the US achieved similar results in the past? How?\n\nIs there a way that these laws can be trialled on a small scale?\n\nFirstly define your desired results, then experiment with how to achieve them\u2026 but at least define your desired results\u2026 because at the moment, you\u2019re splitting the country with carefully crafted lies, like the idea that there is \u201cA Liberal Agenda\u201d.\n\nSo for example: \u201cWe want US gun deaths below the average of other OECD countries\u201d (rather than being worse than the 3rd world, which is what we have now)\n\nOr: \u201cWe want to reduce the power of the state to intrude into our lives \u2013 in a way that is clear, codified and transparent\u201d\n\nOr: \u201cWe want to create a resiliant citizen-based militia\u201d\n\nall of these are reasonable, rational goals that don\u2019t split the country into liberals/conservatives. There is absolutely no reason on earth why these shouldn\u2019t be achieved \u2013 but you\u2019re not going to achieve them if you don\u2019t define them.\n\nAs it is, you\u2019re not \u2013 your\u2019e prattling on about \u201cLiberal Agendas\u201d and the rest of the world, quite rightly is looking on in a kind of shocked bemusement as the country that has ALL the advantages, rapidly stupids itself to death. For the record the \u201cAmerican Gun Control Debate\u201d is one of the prime reasons the rest of the world has managed to get this idea that Americans are stupid. I promise you, you\u2019re not getting this one right."
