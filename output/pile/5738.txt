    "text": "The thing that got me hooked on LeMons racing was the mentality that makes a statement such as \u201cHey, I\u2019d like to install a 540-cubic-inch, five-cylinder radial aircraft engine in the back of a Toyota MR2, then try to make it run all weekend in a grueling endurance race\u201d seem totally sensible. The craziest most devoted racers find themselves locked into an arms race for the Unununium, and this is the result.\nThe engine, which once powered a 1942 PT-22 Recruit trainer aircraft, was rated at 160 horsepower. This one hasn\u2019t run for 65 years, but Radial Madman-In-Chief Marc assures us that it\u2019s in good shape and should fire right up. As for the $500 limit, I exercised my authority as Chief Justice of the LeMons Supreme Court to issue a decree stating that radial engines shall be exempt from budgetary limits. You want a Pratt & Whitney R-2800 making 2,500+ horses in your Hillman Imp, and you can convince us that your hoopty-ass installation will be safe? Fine!\nIt\u2019s going to sit in the back of the car, directly above a Subaru transaxle with a custom adapter flange. A V-drive, reduction gear set, and a much more reliability-enhancing gear is involved; you can follow the whole saga on this 24 Hours of LeMons Forums thread. Will it work? The real question should be: Will it have license plates?\n\nRecommended\n\nWhen I saw that photo, it immediately reminded me of a pen-and-ink cartoon in Hot Rod Magazine about 1974, of a massive Cox .049 engine sitting in a rail, being fueled nitro by some slob with a cigarette in his mouth! Absolutely hilarious! I\u2019m not familiar with a 5 cylinder aircraft engine, just 7 and 9 cyls. At least it wasn\u2019t a Rhone rotary from WW1! That would have been interesting, to say the least. One note: Wasn\u2019t the Tucker originally powered by a helicopter (radial) engine? Finally, how did the car pictured run?\n\nI really can\u2019t imagine this working out so well. In the aviation world, sometimes people put automotive engines in aircraft and these applications generally do not seem to be reliable. An air-cooled complex and temperamental engine in the rear of the car is just asking to overheat or fail. It develops peak horsepower at much lower rpm than automotive engines, so I\u2019d be curious to see how well it puts the power to the wheels.\n\nThat is AWESOME. For some reason, I was just thinking yesterday \u201cI wonder if there\u2019s ever been a radial engined car?\u201d I was thinking laying flat though.\n\nThey should put a low-pitch propeller on it to keep things cool.\n\nThat\u2019s hilarious you\u2019re exempting radials. You should just have a law that if something is a REALLY stupid idea, it shall be exempt regardless of expense :)\n\nIf someone really wants to be the unununium grand champion, they\u2019d be rocking a steam engine or any other kind of wood-fueled car. Hey- great idea\u2026I\u2019d love to see a wood-bodied car that burns parts of it\u2019s own body for fuel!\n\nWe\u2019ve had requests from teams who want to do steam engines, but the idea of a boiler explosion on the track has been pretty daunting.\nNo jet engine attempts yet, though a couple teams are pursuing turbines.\n\nRadial engines in cars go back at least as far as the 1904 Adams-Farwell, which featured a fixed vertical crank and horizontally revolving engine.\nhttp://www.american-automobiles.com/Adams-Farwell.html\n\nMM, I\u2019m the guy who wanted to run a \u201951 De Soto on an outboard engine. We actually had some pretty sweet plans about how to make it all work too, but the whole thing fell apart when it became apparent that more of my team wanted to play than pay.\n\nAt one point we had even sourced and considered using a somewhat rare Yanmar diesel outboard.\n\nThe radial project, however, could very well trump our plan for awesomely bad ideas.\n\nBy the way, here is another \u201cinteresting\u201d use of a radial engine:\nhttp://thekneeslider.com/archives/2006/05/10/radial-engine-powered-motorcycle/\n\nYup, the Tucker used a Franklin horizontally-opposed aircooled six aircraft engine.\n\nAs for unusual engine installations, a few years ago there was a DeLorean (painted black) for sale in Florida for 25K. It had a Mazda 20B twin-turbo 3-rotor rotary, and an instrument panel that was from an early-\u201990s Honda Prelude. The youtube vid proved that this was a most excellent combination. The car was insanely fast.\n\nIIRC, in the 1950\u2019s there were a lot of war surplus aircraft engines of the Rolls Royce Merlin type around. Liquid cooled, 27 liter, 1000+ hp. Dropped into a minimal frame with a little body work they made outrageous dragsters. Then a guy from Akron \u2014 Art Arfons decided to go whole hog and use a jet engine.\n\nHenry Ford experimented with radial engines in cars and I can\u2019t remember the make but there was an early horseless carriage era car that had a radial engine whose cylinders and crankcase revolved around the fixed crankshaft, driving the car with a ring gear.\nAh, found it! It was a Balzer (whose engines apparently ended up being used by S.P. Langley, the aviation pioneer for whom Langley Field is named)\nhttp://www.american-automobiles.com/Balzer.html\n\nNormally I wouldn\u2019t say anything but if you\u2019re an owner of a mid-1960s and up Rolls-Royce then I am sure somebody has spoken of the Merlin V12 from WWII being able to actually fit in many of the engine bays (with minor modification). Most of the time though they preferred to use the marine version which had a slightly smaller displacement that allowed it to be shoe-horned in.\nThe disturbingly large 6.75L isn\u2019t really derived from the Merlin anymore but the older engine bays are huge and had plenty of room to house the monster V-12 motors. The increased weight & loss of a trunk to a fuel tank made up for the fact that a Rolls was able to blister time records and if I remember correctly would have been straight-line faster than most modern cars still\u2026\n\nBig cylinder aircraft engines are meant to cruise at a constant speed, usually producing 70% TO power or less, so this thing is meant to be set at about 110HP and left there.\n\nBig air cooled engines also do not like to have the power changed suddenly. Quick power settings changes can cause thermal shock to big air cooled cylinders.\n\nRedline on this engine is 1850 RPM, why is a reduction gear being installed? So a maximum of what, 925 RPM(??) is going into the transaxle? BTW, Useable torque is probably from (let\u2019s be generous) 1000 RPM to redline. How many speeds will the transmission have to use this extremely wide power band?\n\nEngines of this vintage were meant to have a top oil for the valves. One solution is to mix about 25% 100LL with 75% auto fuel so there is some TEL for the valves. I\u2019m sure the competitors will love breathing lead laced fumes.\n\nRadials are normally dry sump, so it will need an oil tank to hold, oh, three or four gallons of probably 100W aviation oil. 100W is about as thick as 50 weight auto oil, so perhaps straight 50 weight can be substituted. Radials are known as oil burners, but since this engine is \u201cin good shape\u201d maybe it will only burn five gallons or so in a 24h race, assuming it doesn\u2019t throw a piston through the head of a cylinder from excessive engine RPMs on the first lap.\n\nThis could be interesting. Is anyone making a video? If it lasts half of a 24h race it should win a Unununium Medal.\n\nHi, this is Marc, the guy building this thing. there\u2019s a few things i want to address about what you said:\n\n1) the refusal to change delivered power is due to the long intake tract and the archaic updraft carburetor. I\u2019ll be using 5 carbs, one at each intake port to aleviate this (harley flat-head carbs)\n\n2) yes, the redline is 1850. we may push it a tiny bit past that, but not much. the gear reduction you mentioned is not quite that it\u2019s actually a gear increase. about 3:1 to make the input shaft on the transmission spin up to 5500-6000 rpms about what the stock engine this transmission was designed for.\n\n3) thankfully, the leaded fuel is un-necessary. this engine has hardened valve seats. the only reason it calls for leaded fuel is because that\u2019s what they had back then. we\u2019ll be running on unleaded 93 octane or E-85 if we need the ethanol to help keep things cool.\n\n4) yes, we\u2019ll have about a 5 gallon tank of oil on board. the plan is to run a 70W oil designed for harleys. it\u2019s made to try and not sneak past the rings.\n\n5) yes, we will burn oil. there\u2019s nothing much that can be done about that. the motor is quoted for 1.5gal/hr as \u201cnormal\u201d i have no idea what the freshly rebuilt burn rate will be. it could be a quart/hr or it could be 1.5gal/hr.\n\nthanks,\nhonestly the only significant risk at this point is cooling. i\u2019m looking into semi sized cooling fans to move a bunch of air across the motor.\nthe motor is in amazing shape. i had to make a few parts, but overall i lucked out and found a motor that had not been run to very long after it had been rebuilt. all the bearings were still in spec and very close to the new side of the specification. overall pretty amazing considering how cheap it was and that it was sitting in the corner of a barn. the rebuild date inscribed on the cylinders say 1944 and the lack of wear tells me it hasn\u2019t been started in at least 65 years.\nthe other big risk is the drive assembly between the motor and transmission. it\u2019s a bit of a long shot and i have no idea how long it will last, but i suspect it should last long enough to impress most people :)\n\nThe trick to keeping the temperature down is fin area and this engine doesn\u2019t have it.\nAn out-of-the-box idea would be to take pieces of wire, wrap them around each cylinder, and then string them over to the adjacent cylinder like a big spider web. Use wire of the same diameter as the cooling fin grooves so they fit in snugly. Use copper for its good thermal conductivity. It will look strange but it will have tremendous fin area.\n(Or you could just mount an oil cooler in the nose of the car, but that\u2019s less fun!)\n\nthe cooling is definitely a huge concern. you\u2019re quite correct that this motor has very short cooling fins.\n\nThe upside is the motor is rated to 550*F head temperature. we\u2019ll probably be using most of this. we\u2019ll definitely have a huge oil cooler. the manual claims it does not want incoming oil to be cooler than 160*F. we\u2019ll use that as our target temperature.\n\nthe plan is as follows, incrementing until we no longer have a cooling issue.\n\n1) run on gasoline, use a radiator fan from a semi to move LOTS of air across the motor.\n2) switch to E85, fatten up the mixture for the cooling properties\n3) add a 10gal water tank and serious water injection\n\nJust found the Kinner Radial as used in Toyota.\nAre you still using it?\nMy Google search took me to you as I\u2019m looking for the same engine for my Vintage Airplane.\nKnow of anymore available.\nRegards\nGerry"
