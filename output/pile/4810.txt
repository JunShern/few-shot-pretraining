    "text": "To the east, a massive banner on the National Museum of American Jewish History quoted a 1790 letter from President Washington to the Hebrew Congregations of Newport: \u201cFor happily the Government of the United States gives to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance\u2026\u201d To the west, the outdoor exhibit of the remains of the President\u2019s House listed the names of slaves who served Washington, including a young woman named \u201cOney Judge.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithout the least provocation\u201d\n\nAs Dunbar illuminates in her new book, Never Caught: The Washingtons\u2019 Relentless Pursuit of Their Runaway Slave, Ona Judge, about three years after Washington penned those lofty words in 1790 (loftily displayed in 2017), he signed the Fugitive Slave Act. Near the end of his presidency, he advertised in newspapers in hopes of finding the enslaved woman who had slipped away from his household in 1796 and never looked back.\n\nDunbar reproduces one of these ads, from May 1796, in her book. Washington offered a $10 reward for the return of Judge, \u201ca light Mulatto girl\u201d who fled \u201cwithout the least provocation.\u201d\n\nDuring a February appearance at the Free Library, Dunbar referred to Judge as \u201ca 22-year-old black woman who resisted the president of the United States\u201d and quipped that, more than 200 years later, maybe we can relate.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t I know this story?\u201d\n\nDunbar lives outside Philadelphia and is a professor of black studies and history at the University of Delaware. She discovered Washington\u2019s archived ads in research for another project. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I know this story?\u201d she asked herself.\n\nWhy had no one told the story of an illiterate black woman who escaped the president in the 1790s and lived the rest of her life on a knife edge, praying she wouldn\u2019t be caught and forced back into slavery at Mt. Vernon?\n\nThere isn\u2019t exactly a surfeit of primary sources on people like Judge. As Hidden Figures reminds us, black women\u2019s stories and achievements, even at the most crucial junctures of 20th-century history, are easily erased. What about black people from centuries ago whose freedom -- and often their lives -- depended on leaving no trace of evidence?\n\nFrom a research perspective, a book about a person like Judge is a mighty undertaking.\n\nFortunately, about 50 years after her escape, Judge (who eventually married and became Ona Staines) granted interviews to a pair of abolitionist newspapers. These serve as some of the only direct records we have of narratives like hers.\n\nThe rest of Dunbar\u2019s work is a marvel of research and educated conjecture. The author said she pulled \u201con the fragile threads of history,\u201d collecting \u201cshards of evidence written by or about black women\u201d and weaving them into the much better known context of scholarship about the Washingtons, their family, and estate.\n\nGetting past the founding fathers\n\nReaders should discover for themselves what drove Judge to escape and what happened after she fled. But until his death in late 1799, George Washington used every means at his disposal to recover his human property.\n\nAn 1851 depiction of \"Washington as Farmer at Mount Vernon,\" part of a series on George Washington by Junius Brutus Stearns.

Finally, there\u2019s a story about the nation\u2019s early years that doesn\u2019t simply lionize its founding fathers.\n\nThe Washington of Dunbar\u2019s scholarship is a stubborn slaveholder who repeatedly flouts Northern abolition laws during his presidency \u2014 and a chronically impecunious man who struggled with public life and his own health.\n\nJudge, naturally, is harder to know. When Dunbar finally shares a few of Judge\u2019s own rare words, it\u2019s a small but piercing moment we don\u2019t see until more than 100 pages in. If more excerpts like this exist from Judge\u2019s interviews, I wish they could have been woven into Dunbar\u2019s text.\n\nNormalizing hate?\n\nFor anyone insisting we can\u2019t \u201cnormalize\u201d hate and discrimination in the age of President Trump, if a book like Never Caught is a startling portrait of George and Martha Washington (or if it\u2019s strange to see them as characters secondary to a black woman), this forces us to consider that bigotry has always been the norm. Every time we idealize Washington, we live and breathe that historic and contemporary normalization.\n\nBut that makes Judge\u2019s story all the more relevant, and even optimistic. As Dunbar explained at the Free Library, Judge\u2019s escape framed a larger problem for the U.S. president than the loss of a slave: She was a problem he was never able to solve.\n\n\u201cWhat did it mean that you couldn\u2019t control this one woman?\u201d Dunbar asked. It\u2019s a question millions of US women can ask themselves today, and it\u2019s a privilege to add Judge\u2019s story to our cultural lexicon.\n\nGet in Touch\n\nBroad Street Review\n\nWelcome to Broad Street Review \u2014 an arts and culture website for thinking people with strong opinions.\n\nSince its launch in 2005, BSR has sought to promote the exchange of viewpoints rather than any particular point of view.
