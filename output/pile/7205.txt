    "text": "This is an argument Trump\u2019s allies have made for weeks. \u201cCase closed,\u201d Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said nine days ago when asked about whether he would call former White House counsel Donald McGahn to testify. \u201cIt\u2019s over, folks,\u201d White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said immediately after the Mueller report was released. The White House even declared \u201ccase closed\u201d before we saw the report. \u201cI don\u2019t think it is going to be damaging,\u201d press secretary Sarah Sanders said of the report, after Attorney General William P. Barr\u2019s letter summarized its top conclusions. \u201cWe consider this to be case closed.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat early declaration should show you just how much of a tactic this is. There are a whole host of reasons this claim is problematic \u2014 both procedurally and rhetorically.\n\nThe main reason is that Mueller expressly left this as a matter for others to decide. He decided not to render a traditional opinion on whether to accuse Trump of obstruction of justice, citing existing Justice Department policy against indicting a sitting president. He also said he would have exonerated Trump on obstruction if he could, but added explicitly that the report \u201cdoes not exonerate him.\u201d\n\nAnd while doing so, Mueller noted that impeachment is an alternative method for holding a president accountable \u2014 and also that a president isn\u2019t immune from criminal prosecution after leaving office. \u201cA possible remedy through impeachment for abuses of power would not substitute for potential criminal liability after a President leaves office,\u201d Mueller wrote in a footnote. He explicitly declined to clear Trump and noted potential future actions that could be taken.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe second reason is that there are plenty of unresolved questions. Even if you accept Graham\u2019s argument that McGahn\u2019s 30 hours of cooperation are contained in the report and that his testimony would be redundant, there are the 14 cases Mueller referred out, some of which are ongoing. There is the Southern District of New York\u2019s investigation, which has implicated Trump in Michael Cohen\u2019s criminal campaign finance violations. There are the questions about Trump\u2019s finances and his still-unreleased tax returns, which Mueller didn\u2019t deal with in his report. The New York Times reported that Trump and his siblings obtained their father\u2019s wealth through, in some cases, \u201coutright fraud.\u201d\n\nAnd there are of course Mueller\u2019s newly revealed concerns about Barr\u2019s handling of his report. As I wrote Monday, there are some key unresolved questions on which Mueller could provide some important clarity, even if he is circumspect in testifying, as many expect he would be. The last word from Mueller right now is that he believes Barr fed misinformation about his report and that the public was misunderstanding it. Perhaps he\u2019s satisfied now that the full report is out and people can draw their own conclusions, but we don\u2019t know that to be the case.\n\nAnd just from a strictly rhetorical perspective, the \u201ccase closed\u201d claim is pretty discordant. Trump spent much of his 2016 fomenting \u201cLock her up!\u201d chants about Hillary Clinton, despite the FBI having announced explicitly that it wouldn\u2019t charge her with a crime. And in that case, it was because of the evidence \u2014 not some Justice Department policy saying they couldn\u2019t indict Clinton.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Mueller report also revealed that Trump, after taking office, tried at least three times to get the Justice Department to prosecute Clinton. So Trump wanted the Justice Department to prosecute someone whom it had explicitly declined to, but his White House and allies say a report that explicitly does not \u201cexonerate\u201d him is \u201ccase closed.\u201d\n\nThe argument from there, I suppose, would be that Mueller may not have cleared Trump, but that Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein then concluded they wouldn\u2019t accuse Trump. Even if you set aside that Trump recently appointed Barr, and Barr\u2019s controversial handling of the matter, he was confirmed by the Senate as attorney general and does have authority over the probe. He\u2019s welcome to make what conclusion he wanted to.\n\nBut even in his testimony last week, Barr made a point to emphasize that he hadn\u2019t completely cleared Trump.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t exonerate,\u201d Barr said. \u201cI said that we did not believe that there was sufficient evidence to establish an obstruction, an offense which is the job of the Justice Department, and the job of the Justice Department is now over.\u201d\n\nWait, you might be saying, so Barr said it was case closed? Not exactly. Here\u2019s what came next.\n\n\u201cThe report is now in the hands of the American people,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone can decide for themselves. There\u2019s an election in 18 months. That\u2019s a very democratic process, but we\u2019re out of it.\u201d\n\nCongress is part of that Democratic process, as the representatives of the American people. Congress also holds in its power the only remedy for holding a president accountable while he or she is in office. Exactly what course it should take is up for it and the people who elect it to decide. McConnell and the White House have decided it\u2019s time to move on, and from a political standpoint that\u2019s not surprising."
