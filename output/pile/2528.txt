    "text": "Q:\n\nReducing homogeneous second order differential equation to first order (Operator factorisation)\n\nI need to reduce the homogeneous second-order differential equation  \n$\\ y'' + by' + cy = 0$\nto a first-order one using operator factorisation, where$\\ b, c$ and$\\ y$ are functions of t.  \nI began by rewriting it in operator form and completing the square, getting\n$\\ [(D + \\dfrac{b}{2})^2 + (c - \\dfrac{b^2}{4})]y = 0$. \nI'm basically stumped from here. I could try applying$\\ D^2$ to both sides to get zero on the right-hand side and then substitute, but then I run into more dead-ends that give me no hints to either proceed or point to a different approach (at least in my mind). \nCan someone help out with suggestions? Thank you in advance.\n\nA:\n\nWrite \n$$(D+\\alpha)(D+\\beta)y=0$$\nThis gives\n$$D^{2}y+(\\alpha+\\beta)Dy+\\alpha\\beta{y}=0$$\nComparing with your equation, you get \n$$\\alpha+\\beta=b$$\nand \n$$\\alpha\\beta=c$$\nThen you let $g(x)=(D+\\beta)y(x)$ and you are left with a first order system\n$$g'+\\alpha{g}=0, \\ y'+\\beta{y}=g$$\nThe first equation is solved by\n$$g(x)=c_{1}e^{-\\alpha{x}}$$\nThe second equation is solved by the integrating factor technique \n$$y(x)=c_{2}e^{-\\beta{x}}+c_{1}\\frac{e^{-\\alpha{x}}}{\\beta-\\alpha}$$\n\n"
