    "text": "Brandeis Rescinds Hirsi Ali\u2019s Honorary Degree\n\nAn open letter to the Brandeis faculty.\n\nWhen I graduated from Brandeis in 1972, where I majored in philosophy, I immediately knew that I owed Brandeis a great debt. And so, over the past 2 decades I have been, at times, an adjunct lecturer at the Brandeis International Business School, served on the Board of the Business School, and the Board of the University itself. With gratitude I have contributed significant sums to my alma mater, including a Chair in Financial Markets and Institutions to the Business School.\n\nIt was at Brandeis that I was introduced to the pre-Socratic philosophers and was fascinated with how they struggled to find ways to explain the world around them, and how their ideas influenced Plato, Aristotle and others who succeeded them. It was at Brandeis that I was introduced to the thought of Immanuel Kant, and the other giants of western thought, as well as the thought of other cultures. It was at Brandeis that I came to understand that in intellectual dialogue all ideas are on the table, that everyone is entitled to his point of view and that public scrutiny of ideas is the best way to assess their worth. It was at Brandeis that I was taught how controversy served as an impetus to critical thinking, and that it is often the very people who are condemned for expressing ideas, like Spinoza and Galileo, who are later considered the great minds of western thought. And it was this foundation that I relied upon when I next studied philosophy and politics at Oxford University and then law at the University of Chicago.\n\nI must now confess to having serious concerns about the spirit of free inquiry at my alma mater when it rescinds an honorary degree to Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a woman who champions women's rights in the Muslim world. A woman honored in Denmark, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden. A woman who received the Moral Courage Award from the American Jewish Committee and was voted Woman of the Year for 2006 by the European editors of Readers Digest magazine.\n\nAnd I thought it regrettable that upon learning that Hirsi Ali was offered an honorary degree 87 Brandeis faculty members were so \u201cfilled with shame\u201d that they presented President Lawrence with a letter urging him to \u201crescind immediately the invitation to Ms. Ayaan Hirsi Ali for an honorary doctorate\u201d based on her \"virulently anti-Muslim public statements.\"\n\nThese faculty members said that \"the selection of Ms. Hirsi Ali further suggests to the public that violence toward girls and women is particular to Islam or the Two-Thirds World, thereby obscuring such violence in our midst among non-Muslims, including on our own campus\". And they also could not \"accept Ms. Hirsi Ali's triumphalist narrative of western civilization, rooted in a core belief of the cultural backwardness of non-western peoples.\"\n\nFor the sake of argument, let\u2019s stipulate that some of her comments may be provocative and controversial. But that is what intellectual inquiry is all about. For decades serious scholars have examined in all major religions the use of force, the role of violence and compulsion, male dominance over women, the role of honor killings, etc. Since when have these topics become off limits to scholars?\n\nIt is hard for me to imagine that these faculty members seriously think that violence against women on the Brandeis campus is in any way comparable to the violence against young women in a single Nigerian village. When was the last time a Brandeis student was sold into slavery?\n\nWhat is worthy of note is that Hirsi Ali's views do not come from an ivory tower but from the concrete reality of her personal experiences as a woman. She was genitally mutilated as a child, fled a forced marriage at age 12 and lives under constant threat of death by the very people who proudly wear the ideology she condemns. Who are we to judge that her conclusions are beyond the pale? Surely we would not condemn a Christian or Jew at the time of the bloody Crusades who said similar things about Christianity. When Tony Kushner said that the very creation of Israel itself was a mistake, this did not disqualify him from receiving an honorary degree from Brandeis University.\n\nAnd how preposterous is their issue with her Western triumphalism, especially when she fled to the West from the very ideology that is trying to kill her. Is not the belief in American exceptionalism triumphalist in nature? Just last September President Obama himself celebrated the idea of American exceptionalism before the UN General Assembly. Would this disqualify him for an honorary degree?\n\nI am profoundly perplexed that there is no counter letter submitted by any faculty member to President Lawrence. Is there not a single woman faculty member in the Women and Gender Studies Program who can find the compassion to defend her? Is the majority of the faculty too intimidated to speak out against this new tyranny for fear of being ostracized?\n\nThe only acceptable response to bona fide controversy is robust dialogue. It now appears that Brandeis\u2019 motto of 'truth unto its innermost parts' has been replaced by the eleventh commandment of political correctness \u2013 \u201cThou shalt not offend.\u201d\n\nMartin J.

Much of the far left has bought the idea of Palestinians as victims, no matter what they may do to cause their situation. And cultural relativism, carried to excess, makes these academics accept abhorrent practices in that culture as \"their norms.\" The way to fight this is with more ideas. We must make it known that Israel has a right to exist and to thrive, and that hate must never be tolerated, no matter whom it comes from.\n\n(58)\nAvi Goldstein,\nJune 6, 2017 5:20 PM\n\nStop Donating!\n\nMartin, you are absolutely correct. But these are only words if you don't put your money where your mouth is. If you threaten to stop donating to Brandeis and you urge your fellow donors to do the same, perhaps the university will be persuaded to open its collective mind.\n\n(57)\nAnonymous,\nApril 25, 2016 12:38 PM\n\nHypocritical Western Liberalism\n\nI wonder how many people, other than the Jewish ancestors who heard the stories first hand or the well-read student of history, realizes that many boatloads of Jewish refugees - fleeing what was a certain genocide - were denied entry by not only the United States, but Canada, and many other modern day \"champions of liberal pluralism\" - meanwhile in the modern age, the so-called refugees from Syria - many of whom are neither refugees or Syrians, are given everything they could imagine.\n\nAnd now that the world cannot kill Jews, they resort to undermining Israel in favor of a \"Two State Solution\" that the Arabs themselves rejected in the late 1940s. It's interesting how many people will say, \"Well the Askhenazim aren't actually Jews - they're Khazars!\" but nobody will say the truth: There is no Palestinian people; only displaced Jordanians and Egyptians who invented, albeit cleverly, a nation that only exists in their own imaginations. And the West is glad to help them play dress up and make believe.\n\nAll for what? Because Israel exists? And people say Jews run the world. Right. It's disgusting how many religious Jews have been subjugated by their own Israeli brothers and sisters - not to mention deported for being \"too\" religious.\n\nI wish the secularists would understand this: it wasn't the Enlightenment, the concept of a \"social contract\" or democracy that strengthened Jews to endure pogrom after pogrom; genocide after genocide; and expulsion after expulsion: but rather, it was the Torah. You may not like that, but it is true.\n\n(56)\nJerrey Weiss,\nApril 19, 2016 9:57 PM\n\nHonorary Degree\n\nI thought this was a country of free speech.I have no problem with a little contraversy but a Liberal College does isn't that Amazing\n\n(55)\nmarcella s,\nApril 18, 2016 3:56 PM\n\nThanks for standing up for what is right and just\n\nThank you for standing up and speaking out for such absurdity, nonsense, and \"political correctness\".Thank Gd my daughter did NOT choose Brandeis as a place of higher learning for the next 4 years!\n\n(54)\nAnonymous,\nMay 19, 2015 8:01 PM\n\nBrandeis and Ms. Hirsi Ali\n\nI have supported Brandeis for years.

This did not stop him from saying it or others from listening. So it is not being offensive but who one offends that makes the difference.\n\nLinda Sagan,\nMay 19, 2015 3:59 AM\n\nTony Kushner's remark about Israel is stupid!\n\nIf Tony Kushner lived in Nazi Germany he would have ended up in the ovens of a concentration camp. Many millions of Jews did because they didn't have a country to call their own. Turns out that the Nazi's were free to murder Jews and no one stopped them.Had Israel existed the Jews could have fled there. Many of the six million who were slaughtered would not have been.\n\n(52)\nanmashelly,\nMay 12, 2015 5:41 PM\n\nPolitical correctness and no offense\n\nI have always been proud of Brandeis and its wonderful reputation of truth and benevolence where needed. Now we have reached a point where college student s are being terrorized because they're Jewish and/or Israeli sympathizers AND now Brandeis will rescind a hon. degree because the persons thoughts and beliefs may irritate a part of the population. What is next?--chadoors for all female students.\n\n(51)\nBoca Mom,\nMay 5, 2015 5:09 PM\n\nwould she even want it now?\n\nIf I were her, even if they offered it to me now I would turn it down saying that a degree from that university would be insulting if they bow to these ridiculous posers who are so afraid of offending one group that they openly are offending MANY other groups!

I suggest that at least they consider bending over backwards when it comes to their own people to learn respect and love above difference as they seem so willing beyond any justification for others. And maybe, just maybe, that unity will lead to a brighter world where there won't be tragic and courageous people out there to be humiliated by politically-correct hypocrites.\n\n(49)\nDavid Nathanson,\nMarch 25, 2015 10:14 PM\n\nBad move.\n\nThe man whose name Brandeis bears would have been embarrassed by what it did here?

This kind of well-argued criticism by influential alumni is the only hope for the Brandeis administration to change its position on an issue like this.\n\nBut I have to ask you what the next step is, assuming Brandeis continues to raise political correctness over truth and those 87 faculty members continue to teach it. As a trustee and supporter of the university aren't you supporting the spread of these destructive ideas? Aren't alumni like you the enabler of it? After all where would Brandeis be without the support of alumni like you? How many people would pay the full cost to have their kids taught this irrationality?\n\nAssuming Brandeis doesn't fundamentally change please consider the implications of your support for the institution. A man who fights against his own values is doomed to failure.\n\n(43)\nLarry,\nJune 9, 2014 1:41 PM\n\nBrandeis\n\nJews are their own worse enemies.\n\nJim Salomon,\nJune 12, 2014 9:44 PM\n\nConflicted.\n\nOften Jews have stood on opposite sides in debating complex moral issues. Being conflicted about ones choices is a sign of vigorous pursuit of truth. As best as I can determine both sides have some claim to the moral high ground in this debate. From my perspective second guessing in this type of issue creates more problems then it solves. The school should have stood by it original decision.\n\n(42)\njack,\nJune 9, 2014 4:55 AM\n\nBrandeis' narrow-mindedness\n\nThank god we had the good sense to withdraw our son from Brandeis after one year, so he could receive a real education elsewhere. We encountered narrow-minded faculty who were more interested in PC views then in true education or critical thinking.\n\n(41)\nAnonymous,\nJune 8, 2014 10:35 PM\n\nAmen,\n\nRight- on Mr Gross\n\n(40)\nAnonymous,\nJune 8, 2014 10:31 PM\n\nmaybe It's the threat, not the mealy-mouth apologies\n\nI am mystified at the absence of even a hint of speculation into the possibility of sinister forces which could have been the undisclosed, underlying, actual motivating factor for the sudden swerve resulting in Brandeis\u2019s President Lawrence obscene capitulation on Hirsi Ali. Let\u2019s hypothesize for a minute. What might possibly occur in the prevailing universe of present world discourse that could so rapidly and powerfully inhibit the institution\u2019s leaders and yet require them to dissemble rather than admit such actual motivator? Perhaps Islamic Jihad? Al Qaeda's \u201cInspire\u201d magazine, which recently featured 12 individuals in a pictorial spread entitled \"Wanted: Dead or Alive for Crimes Against Islam,\" captioned, \"Yes We Can: A Bullet A Day Keeps the Infidel Away.\" Such constant, chronic, and very credible threats by Islamic terrorists of many stripes to get even with anyone who even contemplates criticism of Islam or who merely engages in humor or creates fiction with Mohammedan themes suggests that there is much more going on in education-land than what has been reported. No protest against the likes of Kushner can come close to convincing authorities to breach academic integrity, but even implied threats by the Mohammedan Community are credible and elicit prompt compliance and meek, unconvincing apologias.\n\nWhy no discussion of this? The goal appears to be to distract people to keep anyone from acknowledging this profound social illness. The real source of our problem is that people are terrified. And worse, they are justifiably terrified. They know damned well that Mohammedan threats of violence are real, credible, likely to be acted upon, and from which there is really very little defense unless the entire society mobilizes, as Israel has been forced to do. So the underlying issue is that our society refuses to act intelligently, fails to reject the Mohammedan blackmail which threatens to return us to the 12'th Century. But with 21'st Century arms.\n\n(39)\nSamantha Morse,\nJune 8, 2014 10:18 PM\n\ncloistered bias\n\nFirst, thank you for a wondeful article.\n\nSecond, isn't it ironic that the faculty members who I surmise have not been genitially multlaited, have taken it upon themselves to attack this courageous woman for speaking out about the miscogeny she has PERSONALLY experienced because they don't want to offend Muslims or to be perceived as racist. Essentially they have tried to derail her efforts to enlighten the Western World about the current state of oppression that Muslim women are experiencing now.\n\nTheir shame is very much misplaced. They should be ashamed that they side with sexist and cruel practices towards women because they are afraid of being labeled 'racist'.\n\n(38)\nAnny Matar,\nJune 8, 2014 4:44 PM\n\nWonderful article\n\nMr. Gross as member of the trustees of that same University you, so rightfully, accuse do about it? It is such a shame that, as far as I often get to read, many Universities in the USA get to change and are fully taken over by Muslim ideology. An Israeli Ambassador is being shouted down, as expected, by their very presence in the auditorium who does what? when?\n\n(37)\nEvelyn Dow,\nJune 8, 2014 4:19 PM\n\nBrandeis is wrong headed in its recinding of the honor bestowed on Hirsi ali\n\nBrandeis seems to be walking a line of \"don't offend anyone powerful\" in the University's decision to rescind the honor previously bestowed on her. The people who made this decision are instead offending the rest of us citizens who value people like Hirsi Ali. I hope the university will find its way out of the conundrum in which they have placed themselves. themselves. Hirsi Ali will go on to do great things.\n\n(36)\nBarry,\nJune 8, 2014 11:24 AM\n\nTalk-show-mentality\n\nBrandeis has chosen to display the convoluted reasoning so prevalent in the media, \"Don't offend any protected group, lest you violate the rules of political correctness\" ... the new American state religion.

None of the courtiers wants to say that the emperor is parading around naked in his 'new clothes', in case they appear to be stupid! Even the emperor himself can't admit the truth in his vanity and desire to wear the new clothes which the tailors assure him look so magnificent! One day, the professors will be caught out by someone who can see the truth, like the child in the crowd who yells out, \"but the emperor is naked\"! Meanwhile, the professors should be deeply ashamed of themselves and their political correctness.\n\nAnonymous,\nJune 8, 2014 3:45 AM\n\nThat's not political correctness..\n\nIt's a combination of cowardness, ignorance and anti-american. We are involved in this up to our necks with this human civil rights issue and Americans never sit idly by and watch these atrocities continue occurring especially in countries we are involved with. To allow this University to put down anyone who is trying to show us the truth is an atrocity in itself.\n\n(30)\nSuzanne,\nJune 6, 2014 8:25 PM\n\nIt's outrageous what Brandeis did\n\nSO depressing to hear that this situation has played itself out AND on a JEWISH campus, at that.

That is fine. But you don't say what you did about it. Did you write a letter of protest to the university? Did you say that you will no longer be a donor? In my opinion you are being mild and squishy. You don't want to rock the boat, make waves or jeopardize your position with the university. I find your post to be very disappointing.\n\n(25)\nAnonymous,\nJune 6, 2014 2:57 PM\n\nA recent book review discussed why Denmark was so successful at protecting its Jews during the holocaust. The takeaway for me was that the Nazi's required cooperation from the occupied countries to successfully roundup Jews and others for extermination. The Danish King went so far as to say that he would wear a yellow star too saying :\" I am a Jew\" if the Nazi's tried to force that identifying symbol of stigma on Danish Jews.Other countries geographically closer may have been overrun with Nazi soldiers and been less able to protest.Apparently Brandeis is less able to protest. -Doing so is de facto acceptance of these stigmatic ideas of \"Honor Killing\" and other methods of systematically threatening, mutilating, beating and any other form of authoritarian submission to females -a gender designation not reserved for humans, merely all animal species.Certainly not out of ignorance but out of fear do you rescind?Brandeis is your submission and defacto acceptance an example of how this type of thinking is perpetuated out of cooperative fear. You are no Denmark.\n\n(24)\nAnonymous,\nJune 6, 2014 2:03 PM\n\nShame on Brandeis/Faculty 87\n\nI as a Jew am ashamed for Brandeis and if I were a supporter of this institution,I would stop immediately.I urge those that do support,NOT TO.They surely don't deserve it.They should hail people like Ms.Ali not degrade her the way they did.Shame-shame-shame.Discusting!\n\n(23)\nFred,\nJune 6, 2014 2:01 PM\n\nHirsi Ali is a most courageous person.

They think the violence against women in Moslem countires is just like that found on university campuses?\n\nThen perhaps instead of sending their daughters to university this year Brandeis faculty members would like to broaden their daughters' horizons by sending them to live in an Arab village for a year? Or perhaps to live with a Moslem family in Lebanon?Perhaps one of these open-minded, non-judgmental female faculty members would like themselves to live in an Arab village for a year?Why not? They freely walk the college campus and this is the same thing!Condoning evil is evil.If the world had not condoned Hitler with its silence and inaction the Holocaust could not have happened.This is worse than silence or inaction. This is positive encouragement of extreme and horrific levels of abuse towards millions of girls and women.I only hope none of the women of the Brandeis faculty or daughters of male faculty members is ever treated, for one day, like many Moslem women are treated for decades. Although why should I say that?After all, it's just like walking through Brandeis Campus!Shame, shame, shame on you, Brandeis!\n\n(20)\nMiriam,\nJune 6, 2014 11:55 AM\n\nYoung women in Nigeria?\n\nThat is a single case! Moslem women and children are constantly and consistently abused, to horrific, unimaginable levels, on a daily basis. One woman remembers how her husband pushed her down the stairs and she miscarried her baby because she walked outside after dark by herself. These kinds of abuses are constant and part of the Koran.It's amazing to me when people speak about women not driving as an inequality in Moslem countries. They are constantly and consistently abused to a level beyond imagination. Read \"Not Without My Daughter\" for starters. Hitting and beating a wife are basic kinds of behaviors.The abuse of children is unimaginable. Terrorists (who are Moslem men, after all) surround themselves with little children to protect themselves. Look at clips of the capture of Osama Bin Ladin. He pushed his wives in front of him to take the bullets. This is unheard of in any other society in the world. And here is one woman who bravely tells her horrific story and she is further harassed, not by Moslems but by a U.S. university? The only explanation is that many liberals have turned evil. I'm sorry to the other liberals but the fact is that when you endorse evil you are evil. No two ways about it.\n\n(19)\nAnonymous,\nJune 6, 2014 11:39 AM\n\ntotally agree with article\n\nI think Brandeis University should have an open debate on this.

She has got the Honor for her act of bravery, but the time has come to earn the Honor for the ways out of the problem.It should be clear, that if there's a Muslim religion in this world, it's the Creator, Who permits it to be, if so,then may be it's time to start looking for the bright sides of this religion and to call the Muslim world to follow the best sides of it?I personally come from the Caucasus where I lived for 28 years with the people of different religions including the Muslims and I can state that we may learn a lot from their best traditions: their hospitality, the respect to the eldest, their readiness to help and support others in the difficult times.2.Is Koran just a book which calls for Jihad, or there is a lot more there, including the phrase which states, that out of all the wars, the war with one's own dark side is the most important?3.And if still Hirsi Ali sees only the dark side of Muslim religion, what's her practical advice to the millions of it followers? Is it leaving the Muslim states and following another religions, which have also their dark sides? Or may be it is better to use one's high education to help the people of Muslim world to struggle for their own better world in the framework of the bright sides of their religion?\n\nAnonymous,\nJune 8, 2014 3:29 PM\n\nEin Od Milvado does not mean that evil is good. You have a severe mixing of concepts going on. Yes, G-d is One and everything that happens is a result of his will. However, that does not mean that we need to accept all of people's choices as good. Perhaps what G-d wants here is not that Hirsi Ali focus her efforts elsewhere, but that other people should stand behind her to speak out the truth and fight against evil and oppression.And what's this about accepting the \"good side\" of a religion? Either it's Truth or it's not. The fact that Muslims in the Caucasus are very hospitable is irrelevant. All people contain good points. No one is denying that. What Hirsi Ali is speaking out against is the evil, and she needs the world's support.Until the truth is out there and is accepted by the world, no one perpetrating this evil will even have a motivation to change.Brandeis could have been a positive force in this scenario - and chose not to be. The question is aknowledging the Truth. Yes, G-d wills everything into existence - and G-d wants us to choose Truth, not falsehood; and life, not death.\n\nYehudith Shraga,\nJune 8, 2014 11:24 PM\n\nYou have a severe mixing of concepts going on\n\nDear Anonymous,I'd like to pay your attention on my using of the terms \"bright\" and \"dark\" sides instead of \"good\" and \"evil\". Bright side of any person,religion,country etc. is their positive impact on the Way of the Humanity towards the World to Come based on the Free Wish to Bestow, while the dark side is the negative impact on the world,which pushes it to the State of Tokhu and Bokhu. If we are clear with these concepts, then we may see that the impact of the Brandeis in the situation is mostly negative,because deciding on something without detailed examination of the subject is below any reasonable standard both for the individual and for the university, BUT their positive impact is that the correcting the mistake is MOST important than even one's reputation in the \"eyes\" of others.I hope too that the situation is an important lesson of thoughtless choice of candidates for the Honorary Degree(the comments to this article has a lot of examples). It won't be easy for Brandeis to gain a respectable level among those to which opinion one may rely.\n\nAs for the activity of Hirsi Ali, no matter which part of her biography is true or false, her courage to speak openly about the dark side of Muslim religion is not a common practice, and it is a positive part of her activity, but the FORM she uses needs a lot of correction.The Sages say Ollam Hessed Ibane(the world will be built on Merciful Love), and that is why they teach us a Three Line Way of Spiritual work:we start with the Left Line, which is our understanding of what is True and False, but them we MUST move to the Right Line=have to believe by the Faith above the Knowledge, that every part of the Creation may be corrected, and then we come to the Middle Line=we make all we are able to change the situation from the getting form into the bestowing one. It takes a lot of courage to state the problem, it takes much more will and bravery to face and undergo the process of correction.\n\nYehudith Shraga,\nJune 9, 2014 1:31 AM\n\nTo speak out the truth and fight against evil and oppression.\n\nHirsi Ali hasn't told anything new to the world,up till 1992 anthropological knowledge has advanced so greatly,that there was hardly a tribe which they haven't studied and described in details, including the most savage practices one may only imagine.Hirsi Ali has told the world her personal story,which for sure demands the courage,she has also shared her experience, that mutilation doesn't lessen the sexuality,she has put into words what many Muslim women wish to say and are afraid of speaking aloud.She has stated, as many other before her, the fact that any woman has a right for self-determination in all the fields of the life,she has also published her \"speech\", which she was going to deliver at Brandeis, and she did it all under the special security protection.A lot of common Jewish women(and men, of course) leaved a Jewish life in their own country and many foreign countries mostly without ANY PTOTECTION, were ready to be killed, murdered or tortured whenever it suited some of anti-Semitic groups.Turning into other religion or announcing oneself an atheist for many of them were not an option at all.We do not know if they ever spoke out, and if they had even a chance to fight for their lives and how they managed to withstand everyday oppression, but we know that their Honorable Lives made a Great Difference in this world.\n\nSpeaking out the truth and fighting against \"evil\" and oppression is understood by each and every person in his own way and if you ask a terrorist, a revolutioner or a dissident they are most probably will define their activity in these exactly terms.The Truth for a Jew is the teaching of our Holy Torah and our Sages. Fighting against evil- is a personal correction from egoistic into bestowing form of life, and their is no bigger oppression than one's own narrow mindedness, following the opinion of others, living the life according popular scenario and being unable to admit one's own mistakes.\n\n(7)\nAnonymous,\nJune 6, 2014 1:46 AM\n\nNext Step\n\n\"The only acceptable response to bona fide controversy is robust dialogue.\" I would suggest that absent a robust dialogue at Brandeis, the next step ought to be to resign from the Board of Trustees.

Whatever happened to voting for the person that will do the most and best for the country. There are good people running in all the parties and there are bad people in all the parties also. How can you say you are appalled with the college if you support liberal views 100%. (I'm not sure that you are liberal, but I would bet you are, since liberals get their feeling hurt if someone states something they don't agree with.) How is you being appalled with the other writer and therefore using words to try to stop that person from making further comments and difference from the college stopping any speaker that does not reflect the views of the college from speaking.

That is the crux of the issue under discussion here.\n\n(3)\nDOLLA MATHEE,\nJune 2, 2014 6:57 AM\n\nHirsi Ali\n\nBRAVO!! TO Martin J.

By writing this tepid article? How is that standing up?\n\n(2)\nDavid,\nJune 1, 2014 10:26 PM\n\nWow! Powerful letter--and nice to know someone at that institution has some sense\n\nAfter witnessing that affair unfold at Brandeis and noting that the only criticism of it came from outside the institution, I had written Brandeis off as intellectually and morally bankrupt. I find Mr. Gross' letter refreshing, and given that he's an insider at Brandeis, hopefully it will help to spur a change there.\n\nThough professing nominal Jewish affiliation, my experience in Boston was that Brandeis stood for extremist secularism rather than Jewish tradition. Perennial biased anti-Israel battleax HDS Greenway, who alternately condemned Israel from the news and opinion pages at the Boston Globe, retired to an honorific office at Brandeis. That appointment, like this sorry episode, clarified just how disingenuous Brandeis claims to a Jewish values identity really are.\n\nTo Mr. Gross: Should you determine Brandeis no longer meets your standards for financial support, may I respectfully request you consider making even a relatively small donation to Yeshivas Bais HaChinuch in Monsey, NY? Bais HaChinuch lacks the treasure chest of a major institution like Brandeis, but unlike Brandeis it fills a critical educational niche for the entire metro NYC Jewish community. Yeshiva Bais HaChinuch tuition is a massive burden to young families, comparable to private college, but it's an elementary school with small classes for children who are bright but who have struggled to succeed in a traditional Jewish classroom setting. These children are being inculcated with a real framework of Torah Jewish values, Talmudic inquiry, and secular studies that can prepare them for college, and, most importantly, they're in an environment that is fostering renewed self-esteem so that they will take pride in their academic accomplishment. Both the merit and the need of your support at Yeshiva Bais HaChinuch is heads and shoulders above that for your support of Brandeis, and I beg you to consider seeking that institution out for at least some of your support.\n\n(1)\nIsahiah62,\nJune 1, 2014 7:26 PM\n\nFIFY\n\n\u201cThou shalt not offend {Muslims}.\u201d there FIFY- offense to everyone and anyone else is NOT ever dealt with this way\n\nMy Christian friends are always speaking about \u201cfaith.\u201d To me this sounds a lot like blind faith. Is that really the essence of religion?\n\nThe Aish Rabbi Replies:\n\nI'm afraid that this is another case of a Christian concept being mis-associated with Judaism.\n\nLet's first define our terms. What is faith?\n\nWebster defines faith as \"Belief without proof.\"\n\nWhat is knowledge? \"An acquaintance with truth, facts or principles through study or investigation.\"\n\nFaith is usually a product of desire. Have you ever gotten a tip on the market that guarantees you're going to triple your money in a month? A lot of smart people have gotten fleeced because they ignored the evidence and went with their feelings.\n\nKnowledge, on the other hand, is based on evidence. We know there's a place called China because we have too many products in our house saying \"made in China.\" There's a lot of evidence for the existence of China, even though most of us have never been there.\n\nJudaism unequivocally comes down on the side of knowledge, not faith. In Deuteronomy 4:39, the Torah says: \"You shall know this day, and understand it well in your heart, that the Almighty is God; in the heaven above and the earth below, there is none other.\" (This verse is also contained in the prayer, \"Aleynu.\")\n\nThis verse tells us that it is not enough to simply know in your head, intellectually, that God is the Controller of everything. You must know it in your heart! This knowledge is much more profound than an intellectual knowledge. God gave us a brain because he wants us to think rationally about the world, our role in it, and our relationship with God.\n\nA conviction based on desire or feelings alone has no place in Judaism. The Hebrew word \"emunah,\" which is often translated as faith, does not describe a conviction based on feelings or desire. It describes a conviction that is based on evidence.\n\nOnce this knowledge is internalized, it effects how a person lives. A person with this knowledge could transform every breathing moment into a mitzvah, for he would do everything for the sake of the heaven. But this is not a \"knowledge,\" that comes easily. Only intensive Torah learning and doing mitzvahs can achieve this knowledge. Every word of Torah we learn moves us just a little bit closer to that goal. And everyone is capable of that.\n\nTo learn more, read \"The Knowing Heart,\" by Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzatto (Feldheim.com). This entire book is an explanation of this verse!\n\nIn 350 BCE, the building of the second Holy Temple was completed in Jerusalem, as recorded in the biblical Book of Ezra (6:15). The re-building of the Temple had begun under Cyrus when the Persians first took over the Babylonian empire. The re-building was then interrupted for 18 years, and resumed with the blessing of Darius II, the Persian king whom is said to be the son of Esther. The Second Temple lacked much of the glory of the First Temple: There was no Ark of the Covenant, and the daily miracles and prophets were no longer part of the scenery. The Second Temple would stand for 420 years, before being destroyed by the Romans in 70 CE.\n\nYou shall know this day and consider it within your heart(Deuteronomy 4:39).\n\nBusiness people who are involved in many transactions employ accountants to analyze their operations and to determine whether or not they are profitable. They may also seek the help of experts to determine which products are making money and which are losing. Such studies allow them to maximize their profits and minimize their losses. Without such data, they might be doing a great deal of business, but discover at the end of the year that their expenditures exceeded their earnings.\n\nSensible people give at least as much thought to the quality and achievement of their lives as they do to their businesses. Each asks himself, \"Where am I going with my life? What am I doing that is of value? In what ways am I gaining and improving? And which practices should I increase, and which should I eliminate?\"\n\nFew people make such reckonings. Many of those that do, do so on their own, without consulting an expert's opinion. These same people would not think of being their own business analysts and accountants, and they readily pay large sums of money to engage highly qualified experts in these fields.\n\nJewish ethical works urge us to regularly undergo cheshbon hanefesh, a personal accounting. We would be foolish to approach this accounting of our very lives with any less seriousness than we do our business affairs. We should seek out the \"spiritual C.P.A.s,\" those who have expertise in spiritual guidance, to help us in our analyses.\n\nToday I shall...\n\nlook for competent guidance in doing a personal moral inventory and in planning my future.\n\nWith stories and insights,\nRabbi Twerski's new book Twerski on Machzor makes Rosh Hashanah prayers more meaningful.
