    "text": "I used to hear stuff like this all the time when I was in banking and dealing with so-called \u201cadults\u201c. To be honest, it was mostly the younger adults, but not always. Now that I\u2019m out of the business of dealing with adults, I hear a lot of complaints from kids that sound eerily familiar and worry me about the future.\n\n\u201cI got yelled at because I had my phone out during a test. I was just checking the time!\u201d\n\n\u201cHe gave me Friday Detention because I didn\u2019t turn in my homework on Tuesday.\u201d\n\n\u201cStupid Principal, called my parents because I didn\u2019t go to school yesterday, now I\u2019m in trouble at home too.\u201d\n\nWhat are all these people really saying? Really, they are expressing their own disappointment in their jobs or in their performance at school. The adults know, however deep-down, that their setbacks are not the fault of the other person. They know that their own behavior led to the situations about which they are reacting. It just feels better to bitch about who wronged you were. They know that there are probably reasons why one person will get a promotion over another. Sometimes these decisions are unfair, but most of the time they are justified. They know that bosses have a lot on their plates, and sometimes don\u2019t have the ability to see everything they should. They know that part of their bosses\u2019 responsibilities might be to make sure that they are doing the job they are paid to do. They know that they are held accountable to be at work on time every time.\n\nMy kids at school are at a precipice. I want to believe that they also know that they can\u2019t blame Teacher X or Principal Y for their own misfortune. I want to believe that they really understand that they chose to violate the dress code. I want to believe that they know that they can\u2019t pull out their cells during a test without opening themselves up to the possibility of being accused of cheating. I hope they understand that there are consequences for actions, and in the case of not doing homework, for inaction. I want to believe that they understand that cutting class is a big deal, and parents get a little pissed about these kinds of things.\n\nBut should I?\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until fairly recently that I put it together in my head that the parents of the kids that complain about the world being against them are the same people who are complaining about how the world is against them! This is a learned behavior.\n\nSo how do we fight back?\n\nIt starts with me: If you are a parent, or like me, a teacher, or any other kind of role model, you need to let it start with you. We all have bad days at work, bad months even. We need to be honest with ourselves to recognize that sometimes stuff just happens. Sometimes we contribute to the problem by our reactions, and sometimes we create the problems. We need to act and react in a proper way so that those watching us with little eyes can learn the correct way to handle adversity.\n\nTake control early: All of the above statements share one thing. They are all statements of reaction. Too often, we get busy, or bogged down in day-to-day details to think about proactively attacking situation. If my boss isn\u2019t prone to notice the contributions I make to the company, maybe I should take some time to point out, in a respectful way, how valuable I am to the company before I get frustrated.\n\nBe your best you: I get that it can become tough and monotonous to come in to work every day and give your absolute best. That\u2019s what vacations are for. That\u2019s what time off (weekends or just time between shifts) is for. I\u2019m sorry, and I know full well how hard it is for me as well, but you have to be the best you possible whenever you go to work. Not just because your boss will like it, not because it is your job to do your best, but because doing so can motivate others around you to up their game as well.\n\nThese are just three of hundreds of things that you can do to deal with many of the setbacks that seem to creep up when least expected and least wanted. I\u2019m sure there are more ideas, and I look forward to hearing what your ideas might be.\n\nOf course we don\u2019t just try to shift blame when it comes to work. Dylan wrote this song, but I firmly believe Mr. Cash did it best. Enjoy!"
