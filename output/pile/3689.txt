    "text": "Te Tai Tokerau\n\nTe Tai Tokerau is a New Zealand parliamentary M\u0101ori electorate that was created out of the Northern Maori electorate ahead of the first Mixed Member Proportional (MMP) election in 1996. It was first held by Tau Henare representing New Zealand First for one term, and then Dover Samuels of the Labour Party for two terms. From 2005 to 2014, it was held by MP Hone Harawira. Initially a member of the M\u0101ori Party, Harawira resigned from both the party and then Parliament, causing the 2011 by-election. He was returned under the Mana Party banner in July 2011 and confirmed at the November 2011 general election. In the , he was beaten by Labour's Kelvin Davis, ending the representation of the Mana Party in Parliament.\n\nPopulation centres \nTe Tai Tokerau's boundaries are similar to those of the pre-Mixed Member Proportional (MMP) Northern Maori electorate. Te Tai Tokerau was created ahead of the first MMP election in 1996. In the 2002 boundary redistribution, the size of the electorate shrank to make room for an increase in the number of M\u0101ori electorates from six to seven. The boundaries were not further altered in the 2007 or 2013/14 redistributions.\n\nTe Tai Tokerau is the northernmost M\u0101ori electorate, and covers an area between Cape Reinga in the Far North of the North Island to a boundary cutting through West Auckland. The major population centres are Whangarei, the Bay of Islands and north and west Auckland. The electorate contains all of the Ng\u0101puhi, Te Aup\u014duri, Ng\u0101ti Kuri, Te Rarawa and Ng\u0101ti Kahu tribal areas, and part of Ng\u0101ti Wh\u0101tua's territory (rohe).\n\nIts analogous general electorates are , , , , , , , , most of , part of  and some of the islands located within .\n\nHistory \n\nNorthern Maori had been held by the Labour Party since the 1938 election, when longstanding Reform MP Taurekareka Henare was beaten by Labour's Paraire Karaka Paikea. In 1993, after 55 years of his party holding the seat, Labour MP Bruce Gregory was beaten by Henare's great grandson, Tau Henare, standing for New Zealand First, ending Labour's unbroken hold on the four M\u0101ori seats. Henare went on to win Te Tai Tokerau after the switch to MMP, and New Zealand First won all five of the newly-drawn M\u0101ori electorates.\n\nAfter a tumultuous parliamentary term which saw all but one of the five New Zealand First M\u0101ori MPs defect to other parties, (including Henare himself, who went on to found Mauri Pacific), Labour won all six M\u0101ori electorates contested at the 1999 election. In Te Tai Tokerau, Tau Henare was beaten into third place behind the New Zealand First candidate and Dover Samuels, who Henare had beaten three years previous.\n\nHowever, Labour's losing the five M\u0101ori electorates in 1996 showed that the M\u0101ori vote was contestable for the first time in five decades, as the new electoral system coupled with the rise of small parties meant that non-Labour candidacy in these seats was more feasible than under First Past the Post.\n\nThe New Zealand foreshore and seabed controversy of 2004\u201305 proved to be the catalyst for the second challenge to Labour party domination of the M\u0101ori electorates, this time from the M\u0101ori Party. At the 2005 election, Samuels and three other Labour M\u0101ori MPs lost their seats to M\u0101ori Party challengers. In Te Tai Tokerau, the winner was Hone Harawira.\n\nHarawira resigned from the M\u0101ori Party in early 2011 and became an independent MP. On 11 May 2011, he resigned from Parliament effective 20 May, seeking a mandate for his new party, the Mana Party. This caused the 25 June 2011 by-election, which was contested by five parties, with the main contenders Harawira, Kelvin Davis (Labour Party) and Solomon Tipene (M\u0101ori Party). Harawira retained the electorate with a majority of 1,117, his previous majority being over 6,000. In the 2011 general election some months later, Harawira had a similar majority to Davis.\n\nThe Mana Party formed a coalition with the Internet Party just prior to the 2014 New Zealand general election. The coalition was registered with the Electoral Commission as the Internet Party and Mana Movement in July 2014, allowing it to contest the party vote. The Internet Party was founded by controversial online millionaire Kim Dotcom, and this strategic coalition resulted in Harawira's main opponent, Labour's Kelvin Davis, getting endorsements from Winston Peters of New Zealand First and the Prime Minister, John Key of the National Party. Even the electorate's candidate for the M\u0101ori Party, Te Hira Paenga, reminded voters of the importance of strategic voting. In his fourth challenge in the Te Tai Tokerau electorate, Davis ousted the incumbent Harawira, which ended the representation of the Mana Party in Parliament.\n\nMembers of Parliament\nKey\n\nList MPs\nMembers of Parliament elected from party lists in elections where that person also unsuccessfully contested Te Tai Tokerau.
