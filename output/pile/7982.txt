(\u201cDuckwall\u201d), appeal the district court\u2019s\n\ngrant of summary judgment dismissing their Age Discrimination in Employment\n\nAct (\u201cADEA\u201d) and breach of contract claims. We have jurisdiction under\n\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm.\n\n\n*\n       After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined\nunanimously to grant the parties\u2019 request for a decision on the briefs without oral\nargument. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore\nordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding\nprecedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and\ncollateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent\nwith Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.\n\f                                        I\n\n      Duckwall is a Kansas corporation that operates regional retail stores in\n\nnumerous states. In March 2005, Duckwall hired Bruce Dale, who was employed\n\nat the time by Michael\u2019s Stores, as its new President and Chief Executive Officer\n\n(\u201cCEO\u201d). In the beginning of 2006, Duckwall hired Sturdivant as its Senior Vice\n\nPresident of Operations. Sturdivant was sixty-one years old at the time. In July\n\nof 2007, Duckwall hired Mapp to be its Senior Vice President of Merchandising.\n\nMapp was fifty-nine years old at the time. Both Sturdivant and Mapp had\n\npreviously worked with Dale at Michael\u2019s Stores and were recruited by Dale to\n\ncome to Duckwall. Dale resigned from his position at Duckwall on February 22,\n\n2008, and Donny Johnson, who was a Senior Vice President and the Chief\n\nFinancial Officer of Duckwall, was promoted to interim President and CEO.\n\n      On March 1, 2008, Johnson had a conference call with Duckwall\u2019s Board of\n\nDirectors during which the Board stressed that the company needed to be\n\nreorganized to streamline costs and minimize overhead. That same day, Johnson\n\nsent an e-mail to the Senior Vice Presidents with the subject line \u201cOverhead\n\nEfficiencies,\u201d informing them of the conference call and notifying them that the\n\nBoard had stressed the need to move quickly on \u201cimplementing accountability.\u201d\n\nThe Board suggested a thirty-day comment period in which to restructure the\n\ncompany. Johnson therefore requested in his e-mail that, \u201cafter we get through\n\nTuesday,\u201d he wanted each of the Senior Vice Presidents to develop a plan to\n\n                                       -2-\n\fimplement savings. He informed them that he would schedule meetings with each\n\nof them over the next few weeks so that he could have an overall cost-reduction\n\nstrategy outlined prior to the April Board meeting. The \u201cTuesday\u201d that Johnson\u2019s\n\ne-mail referred to was March 4, 2008. On that day, a budget and planning\n\nmeeting was held with the Board at which Johnson was present along with several\n\ncorporate officers, including Mapp and Sturdivant. Mapp, Sturdivant, and others\n\nmade presentations to the Board regarding what they thought should \u201cbe done to\n\nmove the company forward.\u201d\n\n      On March 5, Royce Winsten, a member of the Board, e-mailed Johnson.\n\nWinsten expressed his opinion that serious cuts needed to be made to overhead\n\nexpenses and directed Johnson to:\n\n      Pull together your competent SVP/VPs and build from there. From\n      the look of things yesterday it will be a small group. It\u2019s clear Mapp,\n      St[u]rdivant and [Virginia Meyer] are very weak players in very\n      important slots. Their direct reports are likely as weak as they are.\n      As I thought about Hixon, he seemed relatively strong in the group\n      but the bar was set very low. In any event, it would seem there will\n      be no need for a real estate guy.\n\nThree days later, Johnson informed Winsten by e-mail that he was \u201cmaking good\n\nprogress [on his] proposed re-organized corporate support staff.\u201d He attached the\n\ncurrent organization chart, showing eighteen officer positions, and a proposed\n\nreorganized chart with twelve officer positions. 1 In a later e-mail to Winsten on\n\n\n1\n      These were not the only proposed cuts. For example, Johnson suggested in\n                                                                  (continued...)\n\n                                        -3-\n\fMarch 10, Johnson identified eight officer positions that he thought could be\n\nreduced to three. Finally, in an e-mail dated March 21, 2008, Johnson proposed\n\nreplacing the current eighteen officer positions with eleven officer positions.\n\nThese proposals all anticipated the termination of the employment of Sturdivant,\n\nMapp, and Meyer. On March 31 and April 1, 2008, the company Vice Presidents\n\nand Senior Vice Presidents were scheduled to meet with Jim Hyde, a member of\n\nthe Board of Directors, as part of the process of evaluating their qualifications.\n\nSome were scheduled to meet for thirty minutes and some for forty-five.\n\nSturdivant, Mapp, and Meyer were to meet on April 1, 2008. On that day, they\n\nwere told that their meeting times were to be rescheduled and that they were\n\ngoing to be meeting later in the day and for only fifteen minutes.\n\n      On April 11, 2008, Duckwall terminated the employment of Sturdivant and\n\nMapp, who were the two oldest Senior Vice Presidents at sixty-three and sixty\n\nyears old respectively. Vice Presidents Meyer and Mike Gawin, who were\n\nsixty-four and fifty-six years old respectively, also had their employment\n\nterminated. Johnson informed Sturdivant and Mapp on that day that their\n\nemployment was being terminated as a cost-cutting measure and had nothing to\n\ndo with their performance. Sturdivant and Mapp were two of the top four highest\n\n\n\n1\n (...continued)\nthe e-mail that 42 of the 216 total corporate positions be eliminated, and that\napproximately 72 of the 261 existing stores be closed.\n\n                                         -4-\n\fpaid employees at Duckwall. In May 2008, Duckwall eliminated another twenty\n\ncorporate positions.\n\n      In January 2009, Sturdivant and Mapp each filed discrimination charges\n\nwith the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d). In Duckwall\u2019s\n\nresponses to the agency, it asserted that appellants\u2019 employment was terminated\n\nas a result of \u201ca substantial corporate reorganization of numerous departments\u201d\n\nfollowing Dale\u2019s resignation. Appellants\u2019 \u201cclose personal and professional ties\n\nand/or loyalty\u201d to Dale were also cited.\n\n      Before the district court, the parties agreed that McDonnell Douglas Corp.\n\nv. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-04 (1973), is applicable and that, under that analysis:\n\n      the plaintiff must initially establish a prima facie case of\n      discrimination. If the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the\n      burden shifts to the employer to articulate some legitimate,\n      nondiscriminatory reason for its action. Should the defendant carry\n      this burden, the plaintiff must then have an opportunity to prove by a\n      preponderance of the evidence that the legitimate reasons offered by\n      the defendant were not its true reasons, but were a pretext for\n      discrimination.\n\nSimmons v. Sykes Enters., Inc., 647 F.3d 943, 947 (10th Cir. 2011) (citations\n\nomitted). Applying this standard, the district court held that appellants had met\n\ntheir burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination and that\n\nDuckwall had met its burden of presenting legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons\n\nfor the terminations. The court, however, found that appellants failed to present\n\n\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\fsufficient evidence to demonstrate that Duckwall\u2019s proffered reasons for the\n\nterminations were a pretext for age-related discrimination.\n\n         Addressing appellants\u2019 breach of contract claim, the court held that\n\nappellants were not entitled to reimbursement under the terms of the contract at\n\nissue.\n\n                                           II\n\n         \u201cWe review the grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same\n\nstandards as the district court. We view the facts, and all reasonable inferences\n\nthose facts support, in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party . . . .\u201d\n\nSimmons, 647 F.3d at 947 (citation omitted). \u201cThe court shall grant summary\n\njudgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material\n\nfact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n56(a).\n\n                                           A\n\n         Appellants argue that the district court erred in granting summary judgment\n\nin favor of Duckwall on their age discrimination claims because they presented\n\nsufficient evidence to demonstrate pretext or an inference of discrimination on the\n\nbasis of their age.\n\n         A plaintiff generally demonstrates pretext by \u201cproducing evidence of such\n\nweaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in\n\nthe employer\u2019s proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable\n\n                                           -6-\n\ffactfinder could rationally find them unworthy of credence.\u201d Sanders v. Sw. Bell\n\nTel., L.P., 544 F.3d 1101, 1106 (10th Cir. 2008) (quotation omitted). \u201cA plaintiff\n\nwho demonstrates pretext gets over the hurdle of summary judgment.\u201d Id. at 1105\n\n(quotation omitted).\n\n                                         1\n\n      Appellants contend that pretext is shown by Duckwall\u2019s failure to follow its\n\nown reduction in force procedures. Specifically, they argue that Duckwall\n\nimplemented, but failed to follow, a \u201c2-step strategy for evaluating and\n\nreorganizing its structure.\u201d We agree that if Duckwall had set forth specific\n\ncriteria or standards for determining which employees to lay off, and then\n\nviolated those criteria or applied them inconsistently in terminating appellants\u2019\n\nemployment, such action might be considered evidence of pretext. Id. at 1106-07.\n\nBut the record simply does not show that Duckwall established an official\n\ncorporate reorganization procedure from which it deviated.\n\n      According to the appellants, the first \u201cstep\u201d in this alleged reorganization\n\nprocedure was Johnson\u2019s March 1, 2008, direction to the Senior Vice Presidents\n\nto develop reorganization plans within thirty days. Appellants claim that their\n\npresentations to the Board on March 4, 2008, were the reorganization plans\n\nJohnson had requested three days before. But the presentations that Mapp and\n\nSturdivant made to the Board were not the same presentations to which Johnson\u2019s\n\ne-mail referred (which were to be made to Johnson directly), nor were Mapp and\n\n                                        -7-\n\fSturdivant the only people to make presentations to the Board. As noted above,\n\nJohnson requested in his March 1 e-mail that he wanted each of the Senior Vice\n\nPresidents to develop a plan to implement savings, \u201cafter we get through\n\nTuesday.\u201d Thus, Johnson\u2019s e-mail did not anticipate the reorganization plans\n\nbeing prepared until after the March 4 meeting.\n\n      The alleged second \u201cstep\u201d in the reorganization procedure was a series of\n\none-on-one meetings on April 1, 2008, between Jim Hyde and each Senior Vice\n\nPresident and several Vice Presidents for the purpose of evaluating the\n\nqualifications of the management staff. Appellants assert that they were only\n\nallowed to meet with Hyde for fifteen minutes, instead of being given forty-five\n\nminutes like everyone else, and that this deviation shows that Duckwall had\n\nplanned on firing them prior to announcing the restructuring. But even if we\n\nassume that Duckwall intended to terminate appellants\u2019 employment prior to the\n\nApril 1 meeting, there had been no formal announcement of a two-step\n\nreorganization procedure. Nor did Duckwall assure employees that no\n\nreorganization decisions would be made until after that meeting. 2\n\n\n\n\n2\n        We note that appellants make a brief argument that Johnson had not been in\nhis position as interim CEO long enough to properly evaluate the executives\nserving under him and make a informed decision based on merit. Even assuming\nthis is true, it is not evidence of discrimination.\n\n                                        -8-\n\f                                          2\n\n      Appellants also contend that Duckwall\u2019s assertion that their relationship\n\nwith the former CEO, Dale, was a factor in its decision to terminate their\n\nemployment shows pretext because it was a post hoc fabrication. They claim that\n\nthis reason was not asserted until the company\u2019s response to the EEOC charges,\n\nthat they were never questioned about their loyalty to Dale, and that one of the\n\nexecutives that moved from a Vice President to a Senior Vice President, Phillip\n\nHixon, actually had closer ties to Dale than either of them.\n\n      After-the-fact justifications for termination can certainly show pretext.\n\nSee, e.g., Williams v. W.D. Sports, N.M., Inc., 497 F.3d 1079, 1093 (10th Cir.\n\n2007); Plotke v. White, 405 F.3d 1092, 1103 (10th Cir. 2005). But here,\n\nappellants\u2019 evidence does not contradict the legitimate justifications offered by\n\nDuckwall. When appellants were terminated, they were not provided any specific\n\nreasons other than the company\u2019s cost-cutting reorganization and reduction in\n\nworkforce. The fact that appellants\u2019 relationship to Dale may have also been a\n\nfactor in no way undermines the company\u2019s proffered explanation at the time of\n\ntermination. Duckwall\u2019s additional explanation thus does not help the company\u2019s\n\ncase, but without more, it also does very little for the appellants.\n\n                                          3\n\n      Appellants argue that several age-related comments suggested\n\ndiscrimination. However, these comments were either made by people who had\n\n                                         -9-\n\fno role in the termination decisions or were not indicative of any discriminatory\n\nintent.\n\n          The first comment was made by Tom Canfield, another Senior Vice\n\nPresident. After Duckwall hired a sixty-eight-year-old woman as a district\n\nmanager in 2007, Canfield commented to Sturdivant that he could not believe\n\nDuckwall had hired someone that age. While this comment appears to be\n\nevidence that Canfield might have personally considered advanced age a\n\ndisqualifying factor in an employment candidate, there is nothing that shows that\n\nCanfield had any role in appellants\u2019 terminations. \u201c[A]ge-related comments by\n\nnon-decisionmakers are not material in showing the . . . action was based on age\n\ndiscrimination . . . .\u201d Minshall v. McGraw Hill Broad. Co., Inc., 323 F.3d 1273,\n\n1287 (10th Cir. 2003) (quotation omitted). Thus, this comment cannot be\n\nevidence of pretext.\n\n          Appellants assert that the reference to them as \u201cweak\u201d in Winsten\u2019s e-mail,\n\nwhen viewed in conjunction with the comments in a memorandum about new\n\nenergy and excitement needing to be infused into the company, shows pretext.\n\nThis point is meritless because the author of the memorandum, Hixon, had no role\n\nin the decision to terminate the appellants. Minshall, 323 F.3d at 1287.\n\n          Finally, appellants allege that a comment made by Board member James\n\nHyde to Mapp shows pretext. On April 1, 2008, Mapp met with Hyde for an\n\nevaluation or review. During the meetings, Hyde said \u201cJeeze, you\u2019ve been around\n\n                                           -10-\n\fa long time[,]\u201d and asked him \u201cwhy aren\u2019t you the operator[?]\u201d Mapp testified\n\nthat he thought the comment meant that he had been employed in \u201cretail\u201d for\n\nmany years and that it implied that he \u201cmight seriously be considered for the\n\noperator position in the company.\u201d This is not evidence of pretext. This is a\n\ncomment about Mapp\u2019s extensive retail experience and an expression of surprise\n\nthat, considering his extensive experience, Mapp was not \u201cthe operator.\u201d There is\n\nno suggestion that Hyde viewed advanced age as a disqualifying factor to\n\ncontinued employment.\n\n       In sum, appellants presented no evidence from which a jury could properly\n\nfind that such reasons were pretextual and that their age was the actual cause of\n\nthe terminations.\n\n                                         B\n\n      Appellants also argue that the district court erred in holding that Duckwall\n\nwas entitled to summary judgment on their breach of contract claims. Appellants\n\nclaimed that Duckwall breached their employment agreements by failing to pay\n\nthe expenses they incurred relating to real estate commissions and closing costs\n\non the sales of their residences. The question at issue is whether these expenses\n\nqualified as \u201cEarned Obligations\u201d under the terms of appellants\u2019 employment\n\nagreements.\n\n      We review questions of contract interpretation, which are questions of law,\n\nde novo. Level 3 Commc\u2019ns, LLC v. Liebert Corp., 535 F.3d 1146, 1154\n\n                                        -11-\n\f(10th Cir. 2008). \u201cDe novo review is particularly appropriate when, as here, the\n\ndistrict court\u2019s interpretation of the contract turned on an analysis of the language\n\nand an application of the principles of contract interpretation, rather than upon the\n\ncredibility of extrinsic evidence.\u201d Id. (quotation and ellipsis omitted).\n\n      Section 5(c)(2) of each of the appellants\u2019 employment agreements provides\n\nthat in the event of termination without cause, for good reason, or because of the\n\ncompany\u2019s failure to extend, the appellants were to be paid \u201call Earned\n\nObligations in a lump sum within thirty (30) days after the date of Termination of\n\nEmployment[.]\u201d The term \u201cEarned Obligations\u201d is defined at section 1 of the\n\nagreement:\n\n      [A]s of the date of Termination of Employment, the sum of (A) the\n      Employee\u2019s aggregate Base Salary through such date to the extent\n      not theretofore paid, plus (B) all vacation pay, expense\n      reimbursements and other cash entitlements earned by the Employee\n      hereunder as of such date to the extent not theretofore paid, plus (C)\n      the Deferred Compensation and Severance payments required\n      pursuant to Section 3(b) and 3(c) hereof.\n\nOne of the expense reimbursements provided for in appellants\u2019 employment\n\nagreements was moving expense reimbursement. The pertinent part of Section\n\n3(c)(4) in Sturdivant\u2019s agreement read:\n\n      Moving Expense Reimbursement. The Company will reimburse the\n      Employee for his actual expenses not to exceed Seventy-Five\n      Thousand Dollars ($75,000.00) incurred by Employee for (i) any real\n      estate commission paid by the Employee in the sale of his residence\n      in Atlanta, Georgia[.]\n\n\n\n\n                                          -12-\n\fSimilarly, the pertinent part of Section 3(c)(4) in Mapp\u2019s agreement read:\n\n      Expense Reimbursement. The Company will reimburse the\n      Employee for his actual expenses not to exceed Fifty Thousand\n      Dollars ($50,000.00) incurred by Employee for any real estate\n      commission and closing costs paid by the Employee in the sale of his\n      residence in Phoenix, Arizona.\n\n      Appellants argue on appeal that the contract required Duckwall to pay the\n\ncommissions and closing costs on the sale of their homes even though the homes\n\nwere not sold at the time of their termination. 3 They argue that subsection (C) of\n\nthe \u201cEarned Obligations\u201d definition\u2014and not subsection (B)\u2014is the subsection\n\nthat is relevant to reimbursement for moving expenses, and that subsection does\n\nnot contain language limiting payments to those earned as of the date of\n\ntermination. Thus, as noted by the district court, appellants\u2019 argument is that the\n\ncontract requires Duckwall to reimburse them for the closing costs and\n\ncommissions at issue no matter how long after the date of termination they\n\nactually sell their homes.\n\n      The district court held that the contract was not ambiguous. The court\n\nfurther held that, under its plain language, appellants must be paid only \u201cexpense\n\nreimbursements\u201d that they had earned as of the date of termination. Thus,\n\nbecause the houses had not sold at the time of termination, the company was not\n\nrequired to reimburse appellants. The court pointed out that reading the contract\n\n\n3\n      In fact, the district court noted that Sturdivant\u2019s home had not been sold as\nof February 2010, approximately two years after his termination.\n\n                                        -13-\n\fas requiring Duckwall to reimburse such expenses would violate the explicit\n\nrequirement that the employee be paid \u201call Earned Obligations in a lump sum\n\nwithin thirty (30) days after the Termination of Employment.\u201d\n\n      We agree with the reasoning of the district court and affirm on those\n\ngrounds. The contract requires that all Earned Obligations be paid within thirty\n\ndays of termination. This is only possible if such obligations can be determined\n\nwithin that time. Thus, reading the contracts to require these specific Earned\n\nObligations to be paid no matter when they are incurred is unworkable.\n\n                                        III\n\n      The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.\n\n                                                    Entered for the Court\n\n\n                                                    Carlos F.
