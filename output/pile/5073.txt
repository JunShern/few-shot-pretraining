But RDS is not free and also a MySQL server. My question is what makes RDS so special comparing with my MySQL server in EC2 instances?\nThanks. By the way, I'm quite new to AWS.\n\nA:\n\nRDS is a managed solution. Which means, AWS staff will take care of:\n\nPatches\nBackups\nMaintenance\nMaking sure it's alive\n\nHosting your database in a second EC2 instance means that:\n\nYou have to manage everything of the above\n\nUsing a LAMP stack and co-hosting Apache and MySQL is the cheapest, but:\n\nYou have to manage everything of the above\nYou're probably hosting a database on an instance exposed to the internet\n\nThat said, if you're planning to host a production website / service that's more than a personal website / blog / experiment you'll probably need to host webserver and database in different instances. Picking RDS is less of a headache.\nFor anything thats not that important, a LAMP stack makes more sense. Less scalability, potentially less security but also less administrative overhead and costs.\n\n"
