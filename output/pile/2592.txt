See\n\nTEX.CIV.PRAC.&REM.CODE ANN. \u00a7 51.016 (West Supp. 2015)(permitting an interlocutory\n\nappeal from the denial of a motion to compel arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act).\n\nAppellants raise a single issue contending the trial court erred in not compelling arbitration. We\n\nsustain that issue and remand the case to address one remaining issue: whether the cost issues\n\nraised by the arbitration agreement render it procedurally unconscionable.\n\f                                     FACTUAL SUMMARY\n\n       AA Builders, LLC, constructed a home at 3715 Laguna Court in El Paso, Texas.\n\nAppellants Grisele Arizpe and Daniel Avila are alleged to be the general partners of AA\n\nBuilders, LLC (collectively we refer to all three as \u201cAA Builders\u201d). The original homeowners of\n\n3715 Laguna Court obtained a new home warranty on the residence from Bonded Builders Home\n\nWarranty Association of Texas d/b/a Bonded Builders Warranty Group (\u201cBBWG\u201d).                     The\n\noriginal homeowners then sold the house to Appellee Patricia Rockoff in July 2013. By paying a\n\n$40.00 processing fee to BBWG, the warranty was transferred to her on July 11, 2013.\n\n       Shortly after acquiring the property she noticed cracks in the walls of the house which\n\nshe attributes to the failure of load-bearing walls. It appears that the house was built on a lot that\n\nwas cut and filled, meaning that some portion of the lot was graded away and other portions\n\nfilled in to level the property. One of Rockoff\u2019s allegations is that a portion of the house was\n\nbuilt over the fill dirt which was insufficiently engineered or compacted such that it could not\n\ncarry the weight of the house. Rockoff first complained to AA Builders who denied her claim.\n\nRockoff then made a warranty claim with BBWG.\n\n       There are two distinct warranties provided by BBWG on the home. The first is called the\n\n\u201cWorkmanship, Materials and Systems Warranty.\u201d Under that particular warranty, AA Builders\n\nwarranted that the house meets certain specified construction performance standards detailed in\n\nthe warranty document. One of those standards, for instance, states that a slab foundation should\n\nnot tilt or deflect in excess of one percent from the original construction elevations. If there is a\n\nbreach of one of those the standards, AA Builders would be primarily obligated to repair or\n\nreplace the defective item under the terms of the warranty. BBWG in turn acts only as the\n\nguarantor and meets AA Builder\u2019s obligation if either: (1) it is unwilling or unable to comply\n\n\n\n                                                 -2-\n\fwith the terms of the warranty, or (2) following the alternative dispute resolution procedures and\n\narbitration called for in the agreement, AA Builders refuses to or is unable to comply with the\n\narbitration award.\n\n         Under the Workmanship, Materials and Systems Warranty, the homeowner is obligated\n\nto first contact AA Builders to make a claim. If the homeowner and AA Builders are unable to\n\nresolve their issues, the homeowner submits a claim form to BBWG who then contacts the\n\nbuilder to attempt to gain their compliance. Any dispute after that point must be submitted\n\nthrough BBWG\u2019s \u201cconciliation process.\u201d That process contemplates that a conciliator, appointed\n\nby BBWG, meets with all the parties at the house, and then issues a non-binding award if no\n\nagreement is reached. Unless all parties accept that non-binding recommendation, the dispute is\n\nthen submitted to a \u201cClaim Review Group\u201d consisting of the conciliator, a qualified\n\nrepresentative for the homeowner, and AA Builders. If this meeting does not resolve matters,\n\nany dispute must be submitted \u201cto binding arbitration pursuant to the terms and conditions of the\n\nArbitration Section of this warranty.\u201d BBWG pays the cost of the conciliation process, other\n\nthan the cost of the representative the homeowner may hire to participate in the Claim Review\n\nGroup.\n\n         A second warranty, referred to as the \u201cExpress Limited Major Structural Defect\n\nWarranty,\u201d has its own unique set of provisions. This warranty covers damage to designated\n\nload-bearing walls that are impaired to the extent that the house becomes \u201cunsafe, unsanitary, or\n\notherwise unlivable.\u201d Under this warranty, BBWG is primarily obligated to repair or replace\n\ncovered defects. To make a claim, the homeowner first completes a designated form which is\n\nsent to BBWG. Any dispute under the terms of this warranty must be referred to mediation, with\n\neach party paying their share of the mediation expense. If not resolved by mediation, any dispute\n\n\n\n                                               -3-\n\fmust again be submitted to \u201cbinding arbitration pursuant to the terms and conditions of the\n\nArbitration Section of this warranty.\u201d\n\n       The Arbitration Section of the warranty first contains a broad agreement to arbitrate\n\ndisputes:\n\n       In the event any Dispute under any BBWG warranty, including without\n       limitation, a claim of subrogation, negligent or intentional misrepresentation or\n       nondisclosure in the inducement, breach of any alleged duty of good faith and fair\n       dealing, and/or any dispute over the scope of this Arbitration Provision, cannot be\n       resolved by one of the Alternative Dispute Resolution processes described herein,\n       You, the Builder and BBWG agree to submit the Dispute to binding arbitration\u2026.\n       By accepting the warranty, You are agreeing to waive Your right to a trial by\n       either judge or jury in a court of law.\u201d\n\nThe term \u201cDispute\u201d is defined to include \u201cany dispute, controversy, claim or matters in question .\n\n. . between Builder, You, Your successors in interest and/or BBWG arising out of or relating to\n\nthis Warranty. . . . \u201d The Arbitration Section has several other terms which bear on the parties\n\narguments raised in this appeal. One term addresses selection of the arbitrator:\n\n       You will have the right to select the arbitration company from the list of approved\n       arbitration companies BBWG will provide to You when arbitration is requested.\n       The arbitration will be conducted under the arbitration company\u2019s rules in effect\n       at the time of the arbitration.\n\nAnother term addresses payment of the expenses of the arbitration:\n\n       The arbitrator\u2019s compensation fee, administrative fee and all expenses charged by\n       the arbitrator and/or the arbitration service shall be borne equally by the\n       arbitrating parties. Each party shall pay their own attorney fees and expenses.\n       Additional fees may be assessed in accordance with the arbitration company rules\n       and fees. The arbitrator shall have the discretion to reallocate such fees and\n       expenses, save and except attorney\u2019s fees, in the interest of justice.\n\nTwo provisions address initiation of arbitration:\n\n       Any party who shall commence a judicial proceeding concerning a dispute, which\n       is arbitrable hereunder, shall also be deemed to be a party requesting arbitration\n       within the meaning of this paragraph.\n       \u2026.\n\n\n\n                                                -4-\n\f        Arbitration may be demanded at any time, but only after completion of all\n        conditions precedent, and may be compelled by summary proceedings in Court.\n\nThe agreement is made expressly subject to the Federal Arbitration Act (Title 9 of the United\n\nStates Code), and contains a savings clause:\n\n        If any provision of this arbitration agreement shall be determined to be\n        unenforceable by the arbitrator or by the court, the remaining provisions shall be\n        deemed to be severable there from and enforceable according to their terms.\n        The \u201cGeneral Conditions\u201d section of the warranty provides that the homeowner\u2019s sole\n\nremedy against AA Builders, and all those associated with it, is under the terms and conditions of\n\nthe warranty. This exclusive remedy agreement is \u201cenforceable to the fullest extent permissible\n\nby the law of the state in which the property is located . . . .\u201d Likewise, to the extent permitted\n\nby the applicable state law, the homeowner waives any implied warranties.\n\n        The General Conditions also provides that each party is to pay their own litigation costs\n\nand \u201cunder no circumstances shall any party, prevailing or otherwise be entitled to an award\n\nand/or judgment which includes or provides for attorney\u2019s fees and/or court costs.\u201d The General\n\nConditions section contains its own severability clause which provides that should a court find\n\nany provision unenforceable, the remaining portions of this warranty will still be effective.\n\n        On September 9, 2013, Rockoff sent notice to AA Builders which promptly denied her\n\nclaim. On October 10, 2013, she then completed BBWG\u2019s designated claim forms for both the\n\nwarranty sections set out above. On October 25, 2013, BBWG sent her a letter stating that it\n\nwould assign a conciliator after she completed an additional enclosed form.                          The next\n\ncorrespondence in the record, however, is a November 4, 2013, demand letter from Rockoff\u2019s\n\nattorney to BBWG demanding payment of the entire limit under the warranty.1 On the same day,\n\nRockoff also filed suit against AA Builders and BBWG asserting claims under the Texas\n\n1\n  The warranty states that its aggregate limit is $245,000.00. The warranty has many more terms, limitations, and\nexclusions which we have not attempted to fully set out in this opinion.\n\n                                                       -5-\n\fDeceptive Trade Practices Act, and specifically asserting a breach of express and implied\n\nwarranties pertaining to the BBWG\u2019s warranty. She later added claims for negligence and\n\nbreach of implied warranties under the Texas Property Code. Her suit also seeks declaratory\n\nrelief, which in part contends that the arbitration clause is unconscionable and unenforceable.\n\n       Both AA Builders and BBWG filed motions to compel arbitration. Rockoff filed a\n\nresponse, which after setting out various legal principles governing arbitration, recites in forty-\n\ntwo numbered paragraphs \u201cfactors for consideration by the court.\u201d Some of the paragraphs are\n\nsimply statements of factual matters she claims are supported by certain referenced exhibits.\n\nOther paragraphs could (charitably) be viewed as specific reasons why the arbitration clause was\n\nsubstantively or procedurally unconscionable.\n\n       We have carefully reviewed the Rockoff\u2019s response, and her arguments at the hearing,\n\nand discern that she raised the following objections to arbitration:\n\n\n           \uf0b7   The scope of the arbitration provision is not broad enough to encompass all of\n               Rockoff\u2019s claims under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act, the Texas\n               Declaratory Judgment Act, or her theories of alter ego, civil conspiracy,\n               negligence, breach of implied warranty of good and workmanlike construction of\n               residential property and/or habitability.\n\n           \uf0b7   AA Builders and BBWG materially breached the agreement which excuses\n               Rockoff\u2019s performance under the arbitration clause, (or it failed to meet a\n               condition precedent). Specifically, she contends that BBWG failed to contact AA\n               Builders to attempt to get them to remedy the problem, and then it failed to\n               appoint a conciliator.\n\n           \uf0b7   The agreement is substantively unconscionable because it limits her claims and\n               remedies. Specifically, it requires Rockoff to pay her own attorney\u2019s fees and\n               costs, despite provisions in the DTPA and court rules which would permit her to\n               recover those if she were a prevailing litigant. It disclaims implied warranties and\n               denies her the ability to seek injunctive relief because \u201c[t]he arbitrator can\u2019t issue\n               an injunction.\u201d\n\n           \uf0b7   The agreement is substantively unconscionable because it fails to designate a\n               neutral third party arbitration organization. Instead, BBWG has the sole right to\n\n                                                 -6-\n\f                   designate the pool of potential arbitration firms and thus \u201cunconscionably controls\n                   selection of the arbitration organization.\u201d The agreement itself fails to designate\n                   how the selected arbitration firm would designate qualified arbitrator(s), what\n                   rules might apply, or dictate that arbitration should be in El Paso.2\n\n               \uf0b7   The agreement is procedurally unconscionable because Rockoff had no ability or\n                   power to negotiate any of the language of the warranty, the terms of the\n                   agreement were never explained to her, the arbitration clause was not\n                   conspicuous, and she never signed any document signifying her approval of the\n                   arbitration agreement.\n\n\n          Rockoff also claimed that the cost of arbitration would exceed litigation costs, which\n\nunder the agreement must be borne equally by the parties. She contended, however, that until\n\nthe identity of the proposed arbitrator is actually known, there was no way to complete that cost\n\nanalysis.     (\u201cYou\u2019ve got to know who the arbitrator is, you\u2019ve got to know what rules of\n\narbitration are going to apply. So, we\u2019re not even in a position to make that analysis at this\n\npoint.\u201d) Consistent with an interrogatory answer, BBWG asserted that in the past it had\n\ndesignated the America Arbitration Association (AAA) and Construction Dispute Resolution\n\nServices, LLC as suitable arbitration companies. It did not stipulate, nor can we find anywhere\n\nin the record, that these were the arbitration firms being designated for this particular dispute.3\n\nThe trial court denied the motion to compel arbitration, and was not requested to, nor did it file,\n\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law explaining its decision.\n\n                                      FRAMEWORK FOR REVIEW\n\n          A party seeking to compel arbitration must (1) establish the existence of a valid\n\narbitration agreement; and (2) demonstrate that the claims asserted are within the scope of the\n\nagreement. In re AdvancePCS Health L.P., 172 S.W.3d 603, 605 (Tex. 2005); Delfingen US-\n\n2\n    At the hearing, BBWG and AA Builders agreed that any arbitration would be in El Paso.\n3\n  The consolidated brief of BBWG and AA Builders to this Court now stipulates that AAA and Construction\nDispute Resolution Services, LLC will be included on the list to be provided Rockoff. Their brief was filed August\n12, 2014 and is the first reference we find that Appellants concretely proposed particular arbitrators for this matter.\n\n                                                         -7-\n\fTexas, L.P. v. Valenzuela, 407 S.W.3d 791, 797 (Tex.App.--El Paso 2013, no pet.). While this\n\nparticular arbitration agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), state contract\n\nlaw principles determine whether there is a valid underlying contract requiring arbitration. J.M.\n\nDavidson, Inc. v. Webster, 128 S.W.3d 223, 227 (Tex. 2003); Delfingen, 407 S.W.3d at 797. We\n\nreview de novo a trial court\u2019s determination as to the existence of a valid agreement to arbitrate.\n\nSee In re Labatt Food Serv., L.P., 279 S.W.3d 640, 643 (Tex. 2009)(orig.proceeding); J.M.\n\nDavidson, 128 S.W.3d at 227. The second inquiry--whether a particular claim is subject to the\n\narbitration clause--is decided in light of the federal policy and presumption favoring arbitration\n\nunder the FAA. Moses H. Cone Mem\u2019l Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 24-25, 103\n\nS.Ct. 927, 941, 74 L.Ed.2d 765 (1983); accord Ellis v. Schlimmer, 337 S.W.3d 860, 861-62 (Tex.\n\n2011); Prudential Sec. Inc. v. Marshall, 909 S.W.2d 896, 898-99 (Tex. 1995)(orig.proceeding).\n\n       If the proponent of arbitration proves the existence of a valid agreement which covers the\n\ndispute, then the burden shifts to the resisting party to raise an affirmative defense to enforcing\n\nthat agreement. Royston, Rayzor, Vickery, & Williams, LLP v. Lopez, 467 S.W.3d 494, 499\n\n(Tex. 2015); In re Poly-America, L.P., 262 S.W.3d 337, 348 (Tex. 2008)(orig. proceeding); In re\n\nOakwood Mobile Homes, Inc., 987 S.W.2d 571, 573 (Tex. 1999). So long as there are no factual\n\ndisputes, defenses to arbitration such as waiver or unconscionability are legal issues also subject\n\nto de novo review. Lopez, 467 S.W.3d at 499; In re Poly-America, L.P., 262 S.W.3d at 348;\n\nDelfingen, 407 S.W.3d at 798. The determination of any facts relevant to a defense is for the\n\ntrial court which we review deferentially for record support under the abuse of discretion\n\nstandard. Delfingen, 407 S.W.3d at 798-800.\n\n       Because the trial court here did not enter findings of fact or conclusions of law to explain\n\nits denial of the motion to compel, we must uphold the trial court\u2019s decision on any appropriate\n\n\n\n                                                -8-\n\flegal theory urged below. Shamrock Foods Co. v. Munn & Assocs., Ltd., 392 S.W.3d 839, 844\n\n(Tex.App.--Texarkana 2013, no pet.); Inland Sea, Inc. v. Castro, 420 S.W.3d 55, 57-59\n\n(Tex.App.--El Paso 2012, pet. denied)(affirming denial of motion to compel arbitration on\n\nalternative ground where order did not specify the basis for the ruling); In re Weeks Marine,\n\nInc., 242 S.W.3d 849, 854 (Tex.App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 2007, orig. proceeding).\n\n   EXISTENCE OF AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT COVERING THIS DISPUTE\n\n       BBWG and AA Builders satisfied their initial burden of demonstrating the existence of a\n\nvalid arbitration agreement. They attached a copy of the warranty to their motion to compel\n\narbitration which contains the arbitration agreement as set out above. Rockoff\u2019s pleadings\n\nattached the same warranty document. While Rockoff did not sign any particular document\n\nacknowledging or agreeing to the terms of the warranty, the FAA does not require that\n\nagreements to arbitrate be signed, so long as they are written and agreed to by the parties. In re\n\nAdvancePCS Health L.P., 172 S.W.3d at 606. Assent to arbitration can arise from a party\u2019s\n\nconduct. In re Halliburton Co., 80 S.W.3d 566, 569 (Tex. 2002)(holding arbitration clause was\n\naccepted by continued employment). In this case, Rockoff\u2019s assent is found in her filing claims\n\nform under the warranty and then suing on the warranty itself. A party seeking the benefits\n\nunder an agreement cannot simultaneously disclaim knowledge of an arbitration agreement\n\nembodied in that same agreement. See In re Kellogg Brown & Root, Inc., 166 S.W.3d 732, 741\n\n(Tex. 2005)(party bound to arbitration clause it did not sign \u201cif it seeks, through the claim, to\n\nderive a direct benefit from the contract containing the arbitration provision\u201d); In re FirstMerit\n\nBank, N.A., 52 S.W.3d 749, 755 (Tex. 2001)(\u201ca litigant who sues based on a contract subjects\n\nhim or herself to the contract\u2019s terms.\u201d).\n\n\n\n\n                                               -9-\n\f       Rockoff argued below that the arbitration agreement does not cover all of her theories of\n\nliability. We disagree. To determine whether a party\u2019s claims fall within the scope of an\n\narbitration agreement, we focus on the complaint\u2019s factual allegations rather than the legal causes\n\nof action asserted. In re FirstMerit Bank, N.A., 52 S.W.3d at 754. Rockoff\u2019s petition alleges that\n\nbecause of various failings of AA Builders, the house \u201cbegan to visibly sink into the ground\u201d and\n\n\u201cbegan experiencing structural distress.\u201d These problems are attributed to \u201cbearing capacity\n\nfailure in the supporting soil underneath the footing areas.\u201d The last amended petition alleges\n\ndirect breaches of the BBWG\u2019s warranty, breach of implied warranties in the construction of the\n\nhouse, and negligence in the construction of the house.\n\n       The warranty agreement is actually a three party agreement, placing burdens and benefits\n\non the holder of the warranty (Rockoff), BBWG, and AA Builders. The arbitration provision is\n\ntriggered by any \u201cDispute\u201d under the BBWG warranty. Both warranty clauses define the term\n\n\u201cDispute\u201d to include \u201cany dispute, controversy, claim or matters in question . . . between Builder,\n\nYou, Your successors in interest and/or BBWG arising out of or relating to this Warranty\n\nincluding without limitation, a claim of subrogation, negligent or intentional misrepresentation\n\nor nondisclosure in the inducement, and breach of any alleged duty of good faith and fair dealing\n\n. . . .\u201d This definition used of phrase \u201crelate to\u201d which renders it a \u201cbroad arbitration clauses\n\ncapable of expansive reach.\u201d See PoolRe Ins. Corp. v. Organizational Strategies, Inc., 783 F.3d\n\n256, 262-63 (5th Cir. 2015), quoting Pennzoil Exploration & Prod. Co. v. Ramco Energy Ltd.,\n\n139 F.3d 1061, 1067 (5th Cir. 1998). The allegations asserted here fall within the broad scope of\n\nthis arbitration provision.\n\n       On appeal, Rockoff does not contend otherwise, other than to argue that there is not a\n\nvalid agreement to arbitrate because BBWG retained the right to appoint the pool of potential\n\n\n\n                                               -10-\n\farbitrators. Citing In re Phelps Dodge Magnet Wire Co., 225 S.W.3d 599, 605-06 (Tex.App.--\n\nEl Paso 2005, orig. proceeding, [mand. denied]), she contends BBWG\u2019s control over the\n\npotential pool of arbitration firms renders the Arbitration Provision not an arbitration clause at\n\nall.   We decided in Phelps Dodge Magnet Wire whether a company\u2019s \u201cProblem Solving\n\nProcedure\u201d constituted a true arbitration agreement or whether it was only an internal\n\nemployment grievance procedure. Id. The policy at issue included a multi-step process to\n\nresolve disputes between an employee and management, which if unsuccessful, sent the dispute\n\nto a five member group made up of salaried and hourly employees. The employer alternatively\n\nretained the right to submit the dispute to an arbitrator if it so chose. Id. at 604. We held this\n\nwas not a true arbitration provision because \u201c[t]he entire pool of arbitrators consists of Phelps\n\nDodge employees, making Phelps Dodge the sole arbitrator in resolution of the dispute.\u201d Id. at\n\n606; see also BDO Seidman v. Miller, 949 S.W.2d 858, 861 (Tex.App.--Austin 1997, writ dism\u2019d\n\nw.o.j.)(decided under New York law, agreement which designated employer\u2019s partners and\n\nboard members as decision makers was void); Manes v. Dallas Baptist College, 638 S.W.2d 143,\n\n145 (Tex.App.--Dallas 1982, writ ref\u2019d n.r.e.)(one party could not designate its own Board of\n\nTrustees to be the final decision maker and then contend the agreement is enforceable as an\n\narbitration agreement).\n\n        But these cases are inapposite.    BBWG is obligated to provide a list of potential\n\narbitration firms from which Rockoff then selects one firm. The word \u201cArbitration\u201d in the\n\nwarranty agreement is a defined term, meaning: \u201c[a]n Alternative Dispute Resolution process\n\nwherein the designated neutral third party conducts a hearing wherein the parties present live\n\ntestimony and evidence to the arbitrator.\u201d     [Emphasis added].     The definition imposes an\n\nobligation that the ultimate arbitrator is a neutral third party, precluding BBWG from designating\n\n\n\n                                               -11-\n\fitself or some captive arbitration company as a potential arbitrator. That a neutral third party\n\nmust arbitrate the dispute distinguishes this case from Phelps Dodge Magnet Wire, Miller and\n\nManes where one of the two disputing parties established itself as the decision maker. While we\n\nacknowledge that BBWG\u2019s control over the pool of arbitration firms might create other\n\nproblems, we address those concerns in the unconscionability discussion below. But to the\n\nextent the trial court denied BBWG and AA Builders\u2019 motion to compel arbitration on the basis\n\nthat they failed to satisfy their initial burden, the trial court erred.\n\n                                      UNCONSCIONABILITY\n\n        The FAA states arbitration agreements \u201cshall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save\n\nupon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\u201d 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 2\n\n(2009). The FAA was enacted \u201cto reverse the longstanding judicial hostility to arbitration\n\nagreements . . . and to place arbitration agreements upon the same footing as other contracts.\u201d\n\nGilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U.S. 20, 24, 111 S.Ct. 1647, 114 L.Ed.2d 26\n\n(1991). Nonetheless, the FAA\u2019s purpose is to make arbitration agreements \u201cas enforceable as\n\nother contracts, but not more so.\u201d In re Merrill Lynch Trust Co. FSB, 235 S.W.3d 185, 192 (Tex.\n\n2007), quoting Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood & Conklin Mfg. Co., 388 U.S. 395, 404 n.12, 87 S.Ct.\n\n1801, 18 L.Ed.2d 1270 (1967). As such, arbitration agreements are subject to traditional state\n\nlaw defenses, including unconscionability. AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion, 563 U.S. 333,\n\n131 S.Ct. 1740, 1746, 179 L.Ed.2d 742 (2011); In re Poly-America, L.P., 262 S.W.3d at 348.\n\n        An arbitration agreement may be unconscionable in one or both of two ways: (1)\n\nprocedurally, which refers to the circumstances surrounding the adoption of the arbitration\n\nprovision, and (2) substantively, which refers to the fairness of the arbitration provision itself.\n\nReadyOne Industries, Inc. v. Flores, 460 S.W.3d 656, 666-67 (Tex.App.--El Paso 2014, pet.\n\n\n\n                                                   -12-\n\fdenied). The unconscionability defense has a long history at common law. An early decision\n\ndescribed an unconscionable contract as one that \u201cno man in his senses and not under delusion\n\nwould make on the one hand, and as no honest and fair man would accept on the other.\u201d Earl of\n\nChesterfield v. Janssen, 28 Eng. Rep. 82, 100, 2 Ves. Sr. 125, 155 (1751), quoted in Venture\n\nCotton Cooperative. v. Freeman, 435 S.W.3d 222, 228 (Tex. 2014).               \u201cThe grounds for\n\nsubstantive abuse must be sufficiently shocking or gross to compel the court to intercede, and the\n\nsame is true for procedural abuse--the circumstances surrounding the negotiations must be\n\nshocking.\u201d Delfingen, 407 S.W.3d at 798.\n\n       Unconscionability has no precise legal definition because it is not a concept but a\n\ndetermination to be made in light of a variety of factors. Id., citing Southwestern Bell Telephone\n\nCompany v. DeLanney, 809 S.W.2d 493, 498 (Tex. 1991)(Gonzalez, J. concurring). In deciding\n\nwhether a contract is procedurally unconscionable, \u201cwe must examine (1) the entire atmosphere\n\nin which the agreement was made; (2) the alternatives, if any, available to the parties at the time\n\nthe contract was made; (3) the non-bargaining ability of one party; (4) whether the contract was\n\nillegal or against public policy; and (5) whether the contract is oppressive or unreasonable.\u201d\n\n[Internal quotation marks omitted]. Delfingen, 407 S.W.3d at 798. The critical inquiry in\n\nreviewing an agreement for substantive unconscionability \u201cis whether the arbitral forum in a\n\nparticular case is an adequate and accessible substitute to litigation, a forum where the litigant\n\ncan effectively vindicate his or her rights.\u201d In re Olshan Foundation Repair Company, L.L.C.,\n\n328 S.W.3d 883, 894 (Tex. 2010)(orig. proceeding). \u201cThat inquiry is not satisfied by speculation\n\nbut by specific proof in the particular case of the arbitral forum\u2019s inadequacy.\u201d Venture Cotton\n\nCooperative, 435 S.W.3d at 232. We measure unconscionability from the point the contract\n\nformed. Delfingen, 407 S.W.3d at 798.\n\n\n\n                                               -13-\n\f                           Was the Agreement Procedurally Unconscionable?\n\n       Rockoff acknowledges that unconscionability is measured at the time the arbitration\n\nagreement is entered into, but she contends that date was when the warranty was assigned to her\n\n(rather than when the original homeowners purchased it). Under this premise, she raised below\n\nprocedural unconscionability--that is, how the agreement was entered into in the first place.\n\nThose arguments include such matters as the conspicuousness of the arbitration clause, her lack\n\nof bargaining power, and lack of formal assent to the arbitration clause. She does not brief any\n\nof these arguments on appeal.\n\n       Assignees, third party beneficiaries, and successors in interest are often bound to\n\narbitration clauses that an original contracting party entered into. Mohamed v. Auto Nation USA\n\nCorp., 89 S.W.3d 830, 836 (Tex.App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 2002, no pet.), citing Capitan Enters.,\n\nInc. v. Jackson, 903 S.W.2d 772, 775 (Tex.App.--El Paso 1994, writ denied); Carlin v. 3V Inc.,\n\n928 S.W.2d 291, 294 (Tex.App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 1996, no pet.)(collecting cases). The\n\nlogical extension of this principle is that the assignee, third party beneficiary, or successor\n\ninterest has no greater defenses than the original contracting party. Stated otherwise, defenses\n\nsuch as unconscionability are defined by the events surrounding the initial contract. That would\n\nseem particularly true here, when both parties agree there was no negotiation involved in\n\ntransferring the balance of the warranty term to Rockoff. Neither the length of the warranty, or\n\nits substantive provisions were changed in any respect. She did no more than step into the shoes\n\nof the original home owners who secured the warranty. And because there was no evidence\n\nbefore the trial court regarding any of the factors governing procedural unconscionability as to\n\nthe original homeowners, there would be no basis to find the warranty procedurally\n\nunconscionable. To the extent the trial court did so, it erred.\n\n\n\n                                                -14-\n\f               Does One Party\u2019s Right to Designate the Pool of Potential Arbitrators\n                      Make the Agreement Substantively Unconscionable?\n\n        Rockoff also contends that the arbitration clause is unconscionable because BBWG has\n\nthe sole right to designate the pool of potential arbitration firms (from which she is to select one\n\nof her choosing). Rockoff\u2019s argument is premised on the possibility that BBWG would only\n\ndesignate those arbitration firms that it thought would favor its position, thus denying Rockoff an\n\nimpartial decision maker.\n\n        Several federal court decisions are supportive of her position. In Hooters of Am., Inc. v.\n\nPhillips, 173 F.3d 933, 938 (4th Cir. 1999), the court analyzed an arbitration clause that in\n\nmultiple ways favored an employer over its employees in resolving disputes. An aggrieved\n\nemployee was required to file a statement of claims and list of witnesses, setting out contentions\n\nalong with a summary of the evidence supporting them. The employer was required to file\n\nnothing. Id. Once the arbitration started, the employee\u2019s contentions were limited by the claim\n\nstatement, but the employer could add new issues as it wished. Id. at 939. And as germane here,\n\nthe employer provided a list of potential arbitrators from which the employee and employer\n\nwould then make one selection, with the two arbitrators then selecting a third from the list. But\n\nthere were apparently no restrictions on whom the company could place on the list. Id. at 938.\n\nThe employee in Hooters developed a record that the arbitration scheme as a whole was so one\n\nsided that reputable arbitration firms would have refused to participate in it. 4 The court\n\nconcluded that the rules were so \u201cegregiously unfair\u201d as to breach a duty of good faith the court\n\nread into the contract. Id. at 940.\n\n\n\n\n4\n  As an example, a senior vice president of the American Arbitration Association (AAA), testified that \u201cthe system\nestablished by the Hooters rules so deviated from minimum due process standards that the Association would refuse\nto arbitrate under those rules\u201d Id. at 939.\n\n                                                       -15-\n\f       The arbitration selection issue was more squarely addressed in McMullen v. Meijer, Inc.,\n\n355 F.3d 485, 488, 493-94 (6th Cir. 2004) which on the basis of the arbitrator selection provision\n\nalone, prompted the court to hold the provision unenforceable. There, the employer would select\n\na pool of at least five arbitrators who could not be employed by or affiliated with the employer\n\nand who must generally be recognized as a neutral. Id. at 488. Noting the plan was considerably\n\nmore even handed than that in Hooters, the court nonetheless found it risked a \u201csymbiotic\n\nrelationship\u201d between the company and the arbitrators, which was apparently evidenced by the\n\nuse of the same five to seven arbitrators in each of its past arbitration hearings. Id. at 493. The\n\ncourt remanded the case with instructions for the district court to determine if the selection\n\nprovision was severable, because under the FAA, the trial court would have the authority to\n\nappoint a neutral arbitrator if the parties\u2019 selection provision could be severed from the\n\nagreement. Id. at 496-97. See also Murray v. United Food and Commercial Workers Int\u2019l\n\nUnion, 289 F.3d 297, 303-04 (4th Cir. 2002)(court found provision unconscionable where\n\nemployer created list of potential arbitrators from whom parties then alternatively struck);\n\nMilliner v. Bock Evans Financial Counsel, Ltd., 114 F.Supp.3d 871 (N.D. Calif. 2015)(allowing\n\nplaintiff to select one of three arbitrators from list created by defendant was substantively\n\nunconscionable).\n\n       On this record, however, we reject the argument that the arbitration selection scheme is\n\nunconscionable on its face. First, as we previously noted, the warranty agreement includes a\n\ndefinition requiring the arbitration to be before a neutral third party. The warranty therefore\n\nimposes an obligation which precludes BBWG from designating a captive arbitration company\n\nas a potential source for arbitrators. If Rockoff discovers that the arbitrator fails that neutrality\n\nstandard, she of course has remedies. See Tenaska Energy, Inc. v. Ponderosa Pine Energy, LLC,\n\n\n\n                                                -16-\n\f437 S.W.3d 518, 519 (Tex. 2014)(setting aside arbitration award on basis of arbitrator\u2019s evident\n\npartiality). Additionally, the federal cases noted above invalidated schemes where one party\n\ndesignated a pool of specific arbitrators. In this agreement, BBWG is to designate potential\n\narbitration companies. That distinction places an important step between BBWG and the actual\n\narbitrator, because whatever company Rockoff selects will then present some list of potential\n\narbitrators from which the parties will designate the actual decision maker. See Lawson v.\n\nArcher, 267 S.W.3d 376, 384 (Tex.App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 2008, no pet.)(agreement which\n\nrequired parties to mutually agree to three neutral arbitrators from designated groups was not\n\nunconscionable).\n\n       We acknowledge the possibility that BBWG might only designate arbitration companies\n\nwith only a few available arbitrators whom it trusts, but nothing in this record suggests it has\n\ndone so in the past. The only evidence in this record is that it has designated the American\n\nArbitration Association and Construction Dispute Resolution Services, LLC in prior matters.\n\nMaterials from each of these firms were admitted at the hearing below. Those materials suggest\n\neach firm has detailed selection procedures which require their panel arbitrators to disclose any\n\npotential biases. Even under our deferential standard to a trial court\u2019s fact findings, this record\n\nwould not support a finding that BBWG designates biased arbitration firms.             Other than\n\nspeculation, in which we are precluded from engaging, we find no support for the contention that\n\nthe procedure to appoint arbitrators is per se unconscionable. Olshan, 328 S.W.3d at 896\n\n(speculation not proper basis to find unconscionability); see Venture Cotton Cooperative v.\n\nFreeman, 11-11-00093-CV, 2015 WL 1967251, at *6 (Tex.App.--Eastland Apr. 30, 2015, no\n\npet. h.)(claim that trade group who was tasked with appointing arbitrators would be biased\n\nbecause of ties to one party were only speculative, and did not support unconscionability claim).\n\n\n\n                                               -17-\n\f                   Does the Limitation on Attorney\u2019s Fees or Limitations or\n            Implied Warranties Make the Agreement Substantively Unconscionable?\n\n       Rockoff also argued below that the warranty\u2019s limitations on recovery of attorney\u2019s fees,\n\ncourt costs, and disclaimers of implied warranties render the arbitration agreement\n\nunconscionable. On appeal, she carries forward the argument with respect to attorney\u2019s fees, and\n\ncorrectly notes that the Deceptive Trade Practices Act allegations, if proven, would entitle her to\n\nrecover attorney\u2019s fees. TEX.BUS.&COMM.CODE ANN. \u00a7 17.50(d)(West 2011). The statute\n\nprevents a waiver of that right unless certain predicates are present, which are not apparent on\n\nthe record before us. Id. at \u00a7 17.42. Yet, the warranty, and the arbitration clause, specifically\n\nprevent any fee shifting for attorney\u2019s fees.\n\n       Rockoff\u2019s challenges in this regard are largely answered by the Texas Supreme Court\u2019s\n\nholdings in Venture Cotton Cooperative v. Freeman, 435 S.W.3d 222 (Tex. 2014). That case\n\ninvolved a number of cotton farmers who were challenging acreage agreements which\n\ncommitted them to sell their crop to a cotton buyer at a set price. Id. at 225. The underlying\n\nagreement required arbitration of disputes under the rules of an industry trade group. Id. at 226.\n\nThose rules would prevent the award of attorney\u2019s fees or additional damages under the DTPA, a\n\nclaim which the farmers had pleaded in their lawsuit against the cotton buyer. Id.\n\n       The court of appeals had held the arbitration agreement unconscionable, reasoning that it\n\nprevented the farmers from pursuing the statutory remedies and attorney\u2019s fees as alleged in their\n\npleadings. Id. at 229. The court of appeals premised its decision on In re Poly-America, L.P.,\n\n262 S.W.3d 337 (Tex. 2008) which held that arbitration clauses only select the forum for\n\nresolving statutory claims, and are not meant to re-legislate the remedies found in those statutes.\n\nSee Poly-America, L.P., 262 S.W.3d at 352 (\u201c[a]n arbitration agreement covering statutory\n\nclaims is valid so long as the arbitration agreement does not waive the substantive rights and\n\n\n                                                -18-\n\fremedies the statute affords and the arbitration procedures are fair, such that the employee may\n\neffectively vindicate his statutory rights.\u201d)[Internal quotations omitted].\n\n        But the Texas Supreme Court in Venture Cotton Cooperative disagreed in part and held\n\nthe invalid waiver of DTPA remedies did not invalidate the arbitration clause as a whole. 435\n\nS.W.3d at 230. As it did in Poly-America, L.P., the court concluded the invalid waiver provision\n\ncould be severed from the balance of the agreement, thus preserving the parties\u2019 choice of\n\narbitration as the forum for resolving disputes. Id. Similarly, we hold that to the extent an\n\narbitrator ever found that a viable DTPA claim was proven, the arbitrator would be bound, as we\n\nwould be, to follow Venture Cotton Cooperative, strike the limitation on attorney\u2019s fees, and\n\nsever it from the arbitration agreement.\n\n        The parties\u2019 pleadings here did not expressly urge severance as an option. 5 Instead, with\n\nregard to the DTPA claim, they focused on whether Rockoff is a consumer under that statute\n\nwhich is a threshold requirement for bringing a DTPA claim. They both carry that argument\n\nforward on appeal. We decline, however, to jump into the merits of the lawsuit to resolve that\n\nissue. Our role is limited to the gateway function of deciding arbitrability.\n\n        The court of appeals in Venture Cotton Cooperative believed the severance option had\n\nbeen waived because it was not asserted at the trial court. 395 S.W.3d at 277. The Texas\n\nSupreme Court held that to be error by the court of appeals, because it at most delayed the\n\ninevitable. 435 S.W.3d at 230-31. The Texas Supreme Court reasoned that once the case was\n\nremanded, a party could have urged severance and the parties might be back in the appellate\n\npipeline and no closer to having the merits of their case decided. Id. For the same reason, we\n\n\n5\n   One of the attorneys for AA Builders mentioned the option of severance of the attorney\u2019s fees provision once in\npassing at the hearing and only in the context of the arbitrator severing the provision. Severance is not urged in\neither the Motion to Compel arbitration or the response, and is next suggested to us in Appellants\u2019 brief as a reason\nany invalid clause would not support denial of arbitration.\n\n                                                        -19-\n\fapply Venture Cotton Cooperative. and hold that to the extent a DTPA claim is proven, the\n\nlimitation on recovery of attorney\u2019s fee should be struck. The inclusion of that clause, therefore,\n\nwould not be a valid basis to refuse to arbitrate this dispute.6\n\n         Rockoff also urged below that other claim-limiting provisions in the warranty, such as its\n\ndisclaimer of implied warranties, render the arbitration agreement unconscionable. These issues,\n\nhowever, are questions addressed to the broader context of the entire warranty, rather than the\n\nseparable agreement to arbitrate, and would therefore be matters entrusted to the arbitrator.\n\nLopez, 467 S.W.9d at 500; Venture Cotton Cooperative., 435 S.W.3d at 231, citing PacifiCare\n\nHealth Sys., Inc. v. Book, 538 U.S. 401, 407 n.2, 123 S.Ct. 1531, 155 L.Ed.2d 578 (2003)(\u201cthe\n\npreliminary question [of] whether the remedial limitations at issue . . . prohibit[ed] an award of\n\nRICO treble damages [was] not a question of arbitrability\u201d); In re FirstMerit Bank, 52 S.W.3d at\n\n756 (noting that the defenses of unconscionability, duress, fraudulent inducement, and revocation\n\nmust specifically relate to the arbitration portion of a contract, not the contract as a whole).\n\n         To the extent the trial court refused to compel arbitration based on the remedy and claim\n\nlimitation provisions found in the warranty, we hold that would have been error.\n\n                            Do the Costs of Arbitration Render the Agreement\n                                    Substantively Unconscionable?\n         Rockoff raised the argument that the cost of arbitration prevents her from pursuing her\n\nclaim. A court may find an arbitration agreement unconscionable if it imposes excessive costs\n\nwhich prevent a litigant from effectively vindicating his or her rights in the arbitral forum.\n\nGreen Tree Financial Corp.-Alabama v. Randolph, 531 U.S. 79, 90, 121 S.Ct. 513, 148 L.Ed.2d\n\n373 (2000); In re Olshan Foundation Repair Co., LLC, 328 S.W.3d 883, 893 (Tex. 2010).\n6\n   We note that when the trial court here heard the motions to compel Venture Cotton Cooperative had not yet been\ndecided by the Texas Supreme Court. The court remanded the case to the court of appeals to hear the remaining\nchallenges, including the issue of substantive unconscionability based on the cost of arbitration. That issue has now\nalso been resolved. Venture Cotton Cooperative v. Freeman, 11-11-00093-CV, 2015 WL 1967251, at *3\n(Tex.App.--Eastland Apr. 30, 2015, no pet. h.).\n\n                                                        -20-\n\fRockoff bears the burden of making that showing. Green Tree, 531 U.S. at 92, 121 S.Ct. 513;\n\nOlshan, 328 S.W.3d at 893. She is obligated to present \u201csome evidence that [she] will likely\n\nincur arbitration costs in such an amount as to deter enforcement of statutory rights in the arbitral\n\nforum.\u201d [Emphasis in original]. Poly-America, 262 S.W.3d at 356. That evidence might consist\n\nof \u201cinvoices, expert testimony, reliable cost estimates, or other comparable evidence.\u201d Olshan,\n\n328 S.W.3d at 895; Venture Cotton Cooperative. v. Freeman, 11-11-00093-CV, 2015 WL\n\n1967251, at *3 (Tex.App.--Eastland Apr. 30, 2015, no pet. h.). The evidence must allow the trial\n\ncourt to analyze: (1) the claimant\u2019s ability to pay the arbitration fees and costs, (2) the expected\n\ncost differential between arbitration and litigation and whether that differential is so substantial\n\nthat it deters the claimant from bringing its claims, and (3) the actual cost of arbitration\n\ncompared to the total amount of damages that the claimant is seeking. Olshan, 328 S.W.3d at\n\n895. \u201c[A] comparison of the total costs of the two forums is the most important factor in\n\ndetermining whether the arbitral forum is an adequate and accessible substitute to litigation.\u201d Id.\n\nat 894-95.\n\n       BBWG and AA Builders now claim that Rockoff has failed to meet her burden to make\n\nsuch a showing. But we agree with Rockoff that she could hardly present to the trial court a\n\ncalculation of the cost of arbitration versus litigation when no one knew the identity of the\n\narbitrator. And the identity of the arbitrator could not be known until BBWG and AA Builders\n\nsatisfied their obligation to present a list of potential arbitration firms. It is not enough to merely\n\nsuggest the names of arbitration firms used in the past, and then ask the trial court to speculate\n\nwhat their costs might be if in fact they were put on the final list. We hold the cost analysis\n\nunder the substantive unconscionability claim would have been premature when the trial court\n\ndenied the motions to compel, and it cannot be done on the record before us. Accordingly, to the\n\n\n\n                                                 -21-\n\fextent that Rockoff wishes to re-urge this ground, she is free to do so once the identity of the\n\narbitrator is decided.\n\n                                   BREACH OF CONTRACT\n\n        Rockoff also urged below that BBWG\u2019s failure to informally talk with AA Builders to\n\ngain its compliance with the warranty, and its failure to appoint a conciliator, breached the\n\ncontract, or was at least a condition precedent to arbitration. She additionally contends this now\n\nexcuses her performance under the arbitration provisions.\n\n        In support of this view, Rockoff principally relies on In re Igloo Products Corp., 238\n\nS.W.3d 574, 581 (Tex.App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 2007, orig. proceeding) which held that the\n\nfailure to mediate a dispute as required by the parties contract meant that any obligation to\n\narbitrate was never triggered. The contract in that case expressly stated that arbitration \u201cshall not\n\nbe invoked unless the party seeking arbitration has first mediated the dispute with the other party\n\nor parties.\u201d Id. at 578; see also In re Pisces Foods, L.L.C., 228 S.W.3d 349, 351 (Tex.App.--\n\nAustin 2007, orig. proceeding)(similar holding based on clause that specified pre-arbitration\n\nprocedures that \u201cmust be followed in sequence\u201d). The warranty before us is not as explicit,\n\nstating only that if the conciliation process required for the Workmanship, Materials and Systems\n\nWarranty, or the mediation required for the Express Limited Major Structural Defect Warranty\n\nfails, then Rockoff \u201cmust submit the Dispute to binding arbitration pursuant to the terms and\n\nconditions of the Arbitration Section of this warranty.\u201d Nor are the sequence of events here as\n\nclear as in Igloo Prod. and Pisces Food, and therein lies one problem with Rockoff\u2019s argument.\n\n        Conditions precedent to arbitration are generally viewed as procedural arbitrability issue,\n\nand are accordingly matters for the arbitrator to determine. Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds,\n\nInc., 537 U.S. 79, 84-85, 123 S.Ct. 588, 154 L.Ed.2d 491 (2002); John Wiley & Sons, Inc. v.\n\n\n\n                                                -22-\n\fLivingston, 376 U.S. 543, 557, 84 S.Ct. 909, 11 L.Ed.2d 898 (1964); In re Global Const.\n\nCompany, L.L.C, 166 S.W.3d 795, 798 (Tex.App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 2005, orig. proceeding).\n\nAccordingly, questions of exhaustion of internal dispute resolution procedures would be a matter\n\nfor the arbitrator. Omoruyi v. Grocers Supply Co., Inc., 14-09-00151-CV, 2010 WL 1992585, at\n\n*8 (Tex.App.--Houston [14th Dist.] May 20, 2010, no pet.). Omoruyi is instructive, because the\n\ncourt distinguished its own earlier opinion in Igloo Prods., describing it as an exception applying\n\nonly when the issues were \u201cfactually undisputed.\u201d Id. See also General Warehousemen &\n\nHelpers Union Local 767 v. Albertson\u2019s Distribution, Inc., 331 F.3d 485, 488 (5th Cir.\n\n2003)(referring to this as a \u201crare exception\u201d applying only if \u201cno rational mind could question\n\nthat the parties intended for a procedural provision to preclude arbitration and that the breach of\n\nthe procedural requirement was clear.\u201d)(internal quotations omitted). By contrast the parties in\n\nOmoruyi disputed whether certain predicate steps were taken or not, and the court left that\n\ndisputed issue to the arbitrator. Id. at *8.\n\n        In much the same the way, at best Rockoff\u2019s contention that BBGW breached its pre-\n\narbitration obligations is disputed, and at worse, there is no evidence any breach. We find no\n\nevidence in the record, for instance, that BBWG failed to contact AA Builders to attempt to get\n\nthem to comply with its warranty obligation.          The only evidence in the record regarding\n\nconciliation is a letter from BBGW to Rockoff\u2019s attorney asking that a claim form be completed\n\nso it could designate an appropriate conciliator. Ten days later, Rockoff served a demand for the\n\nmonetary limit of the warranty and simultaneously filed a lawsuit. BBWG claimed in an\n\ninterrogatory answer that Rockoff filed suit before it could appoint a conciliator. We find no\n\nrecord support that BBGW breached its obligation to appoint a conciliator.\n\n\n\n\n                                               -23-\n\f       There is a second problem with Rockoff\u2019s breach of contract claim. She asserted claims\n\nunder both of the warranty clauses we previously described. Her complaints below addressed\n\nalleged failure of BBGW to contact AA Builders, and failure to appoint a conciliator. Those\n\nrequirements apply only the Workmanship, Materials and Systems Warranty.                She never\n\ncomplained below of any failure to hold a mediation, which is the only preliminary procedure\n\nrequired for the Express Limited Major Structural Defect Warranty. We find nothing in the\n\nrecord where she presented any evidence regarding mediation at all. So even if she were correct\n\nthat the BBWG failed to follow the conciliation process, that would not excuse arbitration under\n\nthe Express Limited Major Structural Defect Warranty claims.\n\n       But the record here does confront us with one glaring deficiency with BBWG and AA\n\nBuilders\u2019 request for arbitration--neither Appellant ever provided Rockoff with a list of potential\n\narbitration firms to hear this dispute. Neither BBWG or AA Builders point to a place in the\n\nrecord below where Rockoff was given a list of approved arbitration companies from which she\n\nwas to choose an arbitrator at the time arbitration was requested. At most, an interrogatory\n\nanswer set out the identity of two firms that BBGW had approved in the past. The same\n\ninterrogatory answer states that \u201cArbitrators and arbitration companies are selected by agreement\n\non a case by case basis.\u201d\n\n       In their opening brief to this court, BBWG and AA Builders contend that they could not\n\nprovide a list of suitable arbitrators until Rockoff asked for arbitration. There is nothing in the\n\narbitration clause, however, that imposes such an obligation distinctly on Rockoff. Moreover,\n\nwe note the agreement provides that the filing of a lawsuit is itself deemed to be request to\n\narbitrate. BBWG and AA Builders never provided Rockoff with the list of arbitrators from\n\nwhich to choose.\n\n\n\n                                               -24-\n\f         Ordinarily this might end the inquiry, but Rockoff never distinctly raised this issue below\n\nas a reason to deny the motion, nor does she on appeal.7 And even if she had, we would be in the\n\nsame posture as Venture Cotton Cooperative where a remand solely on this basis without\n\naddressing the other issues would not put the parties any closer to a final resolution of their\n\ndispute. This arbitration agreement is governed by the FAA which has a specific gap filling\n\nprovision when there is a failure to appoint an arbitrator pursuant to the parties\u2019 agreement:\n\n         If in the agreement provision be made for a method of naming or appointing an\n         arbitrator or arbitrators or an umpire, such method shall be followed; but if no\n         method be provided therein, or if a method be provided and any party thereto\n         shall fail to avail himself of such method, or if for any other reason there shall be a\n         lapse in the naming of an arbitrator or arbitrators or umpire, or in filling a\n         vacancy, then upon the application of either party to the controversy the court\n         shall designate and appoint an arbitrator or arbitrators or umpire, as the case may\n         require, who shall act under the said agreement with the same force and effect as\n         if he or they had been specifically named therein; and unless otherwise provided\n         in the agreement the arbitration shall be by a single arbitrator. [Emphasis added].\n\n9 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 5 (2009); see Pacific Reinsurance Management Corp. v. Ohio Reinsurance Corp.,\n\n814 F.2d 1324, 1329 (9th Cir. 1987)(\u201cthe intent of Congress was to spur the arbitral process\n\nforward, rather than to let it stagnate into endless bickering over the selection process\u201d).\n\n         Were the matter left entirely to us, we would remand with instructions for the trial court\n\nto appoint an arbitrator given that BBWG and AA Builders \u201cfail[ed] to avail\u201d themselves of the\n\nmethod set out in the agreement. The gap filling provision of Section 5, however, requires an\n\n\u201capplication of either party\u201d which we view as limiting our ability to order this on our own\n\ninitiative. On remand, however, we are confident that the trial court will expedite the process of\n\nselecting an arbitrator (or one party may make an application under Section 5) so that the trial\n\n\n\n\n7\n   Her argument below, obscured in one of the forty-two numbered paragraphs of \u201cfactors for the trial court to\nconsider,\u201d was that there never a \u201cpre-existing\u201d list of approved arbitrators. But that was never a requirement under\nthe warranty. Instead, the warranty states that \u201cBBWG will provide [the list] to You when arbitration is requested.\u201d\n\n                                                        -25-\n\fcourt may resolve one last issue that was raised below: whether the agreement is substantively\n\nunconscionable because of the costs of arbitration.\n\n                                        CONCLUSION\n\n        Appellants met their initial burden to show the existence of an arbitration agreement that\n\ncovered the claims asserted in the lawsuit. Two of the three reasons that Rockoff urges on\n\nappeal to deny arbitration--substantive unconscionability because of the manner of arbitrator\n\nselection, and breach of contract--lack merit on this record and cannot sustain the trial court\u2019s\n\norder. Of the other reasons she asserted below--procedural unconscionability and that the claims\n\nare not covered by the agreement--likewise lack merit. Her assertion here and below that the\n\narbitration costs might make the agreement procedurally unconscionable cannot be decided on\n\nthis record because the identity of the arbitrator is yet to be determined. Accordingly, we remand\n\nthe case with instructions to obtain an appointment of an arbitrator. So long as the costs of\n\narbitration do not render the agreement substantively unconscionable under the applicable legal\n\nstandards, we order the trial court to grant the pending motions to stay the litigation and compel\n\narbitration.\n\n\nJune 16, 2016\n                                      ANN CRAWFORD McCLURE, Chief Justice\n\nBefore McClure, C.J., Rodriguez, and Hughes, JJ.\n\n\n\n\n                                               -26-\n\f"
