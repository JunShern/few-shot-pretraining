    "text": "Sunday, October 23, 2016\n\nTrump and the Theological Origins of Modernity\n\nOn a Sunday\nafternoon, following a spectacular road trip down the Mississippi to Red Wing\nand then back up the Wisconsin side, with a slice of cheese on the plate and a Picardy glass of pinot\nnoir beside it, the time has perhaps arrived to consider whether the Trump phenomenon\nmight be properly explained by reference to the nominalist challenge to\nScholasticism that arose in the early fourteenth century.\n\nThat seems\nto be the thesis advanced by Michael Allen Gillespie in his recent book, The Theological Origins of Modernity. One\ncannot read more than a few pages of this crisply written work without\nscreeching to a halt repeatedly at the specious generalizations, the most\nglaring of which concerns the concept of modernity itself. Does such a thing as\nmodernity exist? If so, in what does it consist?\n\nThe simple\nanswer is that modernity does not exist in any palpable way. We are all cave\ndwellers, slaves, saints, foragers, mystics, warriors, scientists, artists, lovers,\nbureaucrats, and heals, and the recent history of our nation reflects that\ncomplex and contradictory makeup. The more historically minded among us might sometimes\npropose that we are creatures of reason and self-assertion who have triumphed\nover the dogma and superstition of the Middle Ages, and such is, in fact, the\ncase. But only to a degree.\n\nThe same\nthing could be said in reverse, of course. Very few people who lived during the\nMiddle Ages knew the slightest thing about the medieval \"world view\"\nso amply elaborated by Thomas Aquinas, and they certainly knew nothing at all about\nthe long-running dispute between the \"realists\" and the \"nominalists.\" They could be very \"modern.\" If you've read a few bawdy stories from the Decameron (1353) or the even more risque French fabliaux upon which Boccaccio's\ntales are often based, the similarity between the modern era and the Middle\nAges becomes more striking still.\n\nAnd consider\nthe troubadours, who, nine hundred years ago, were often filled with \"modernist\"\nindividuality and self-assertion. In one\nof his lyrics Bernart de Ventadorn (ca. 1150) writes:\n\nOf course it\u2019s no wonder I sing\n\nbetter than any other troubadour:\n\nmy heart draws me more toward love,\n\nand I am better made for his command.\n\nHeart body knowledge sense\n\nstrength and energy\u2014I have set all on love,\n\nThe rein draws me straight toward love,\n\nand I cannot turn toward anything else.\n\nA man is really dead when he does not feel\n\nsome sweet taste of love in his heart;\n\nand what is it worth to live without worth,\n\nexcept to irritate everybody?\n\nMay the Lord God never hate me so\n\nthat I live another day, or even less than a day,\n\nafter I am guilty of being such a pest,\n\nand I no longer have the will to love.\n\nTo modern ears verses of this kind may sound naive. In any case, the idea they advance\u2014that preferential amorous love lies at the center of masculine\nself-worth\u2014is not terribly Christian. Fealty to the local duke or king,\ncertainly; dedication to a life of spiritual exercises and obligations,\nof course. But on what grounds can personal love be elevated to the highest plane\nof value? Yet this is what the troubadours espoused repeatedly, and it had the\neffect of turning life, at least as it appears in the courtly literature of the times,\ninto a series of inspired but also arbitrary, grandiose, and often ridiculous adventures.\n\nThe\nGerman scholar Erich Auerbach once noted:\n\nWhen\nwe moderns speak of adventure, we mean something unstable, peripheral,\ndisordered\u2026 a something that stands outside the real meaning of existence. All\nof this is precisely what the word does not mean in the courtly romance. On the\ncontrary, trial through adventure is the real meaning of the knight\u2019s ideal\nexistence.\n\nI look\nforward to examining Gillespie's analysis of the nominalist challenge to the realist\northodoxy more closely. The arguments bear striking parallels to those we use today to keep the arrogance of scientistic reasoning at bay. But I doubt whether he will hit on the central truth of\nthe matter: the nominalists were right, for the most part. There are many\nhorses in the world, but the thing called \"horse\" does not actually exist.\nAnother way of putting the same point is that Aristotle's notion of\n\"species,\" which is still in wide use today, is a fiction\u2014a useful but metaphysically\nempty fiction. (I have a secret hunch that this is what Gillespie's overriding point will turn out to be. But will I have the patience to ferret it out?)\n\nMatters are complicated by the fact that in a few instances, the realists had the upper ground, and these are the most important ones. Every beautiful thing partakes of \"beauty.\"\nEvery accurate judgment partakes of \"truth.\" Every loving act partakes of that quality. (Ask Bernart!) And speaking more broadly (but\nalso more vaguely), every worthy action of any kind partakes of \"god.\"\n\nAbout Me\n\nThe Macaroni blog is dedicated to the subjects that have enlivened the print edition of Macaroni for more than twenty-five years - travel, films, food, ideas, music ... you name it.
