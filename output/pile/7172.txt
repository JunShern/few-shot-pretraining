Despite evidence of survival benefit, a meta\u2010analysis[4](#bjs550277-bib-0004){ref-type=\"ref\"} comparing NAC with surgery alone in 2062 patients found only a 5\u00b71 per cent absolute 2\u2010year survival advantage after NAC, because only a small minority experienced a significant pathological response. In a multicentre cohort study[5](#bjs550277-bib-0005){ref-type=\"ref\"}, a clinically meaningful local response to NAC was restricted to the 14\u00b78 per cent of patients with a tumour regression grade (TRG) of 1--2.\n\nInflammation is now widely recognized as a feature of many cancers[6](#bjs550277-bib-0006){ref-type=\"ref\"}. Among a variety of inflammatory markers, derivative biomarkers -- neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR), neutrophil to platelet score, and the modified Glasgow Prognostic Score (mGPS) -- have been reported to be associated with poor survival[7](#bjs550277-bib-0007){ref-type=\"ref\"}, [8](#bjs550277-bib-0008){ref-type=\"ref\"}, [9](#bjs550277-bib-0009){ref-type=\"ref\"}.\n\nThe aim of this study was to determine whether clinically readily available serum markers of inflammation obtained from routinely performed patient screening blood profiles might predict response to potentially curative NAC in OAC, and whether there was a subsequent relationship with survival after potentially curative oesophagectomy.\n\nMethods {#bjs550277-sec-0006}\n=======\n\nTo test the proposed hypotheses, a single cohort of patients diagnosed with OAC between 1 January 2010 and 31 August 2018 was recruited, and included patients with radiological TNM stage I--III deemed amenable to treatment with curative intent. All patients were managed by a multidisciplinary specialist team (MDT) with an interest in oesophageal cancer, including clinical nurse specialists, gastroenterologists, surgeons, oncologists, radiologists, anaesthetists and pathologists[10](#bjs550277-bib-0010){ref-type=\"ref\"}. Management plans were individually tailored according to both patient and disease factors. Staging was done by means of CT, endoscopic ultrasonography, CT--PET and staging laparoscopy as appropriate. The South\u2010East Wales MDT treatment algorithms for oesophageal carcinoma have been described previously[11](#bjs550277-bib-0011){ref-type=\"ref\"}, [12](#bjs550277-bib-0012){ref-type=\"ref\"}, [13](#bjs550277-bib-0013){ref-type=\"ref\"}.\n\nThe majority of patients received two cycles of cisplatin 80\u2009mg/m^2^ and 5\u2010fluorouracil 1000\u2009mg/m^2^ for 4\u2009days. A minority received three cycles of epirubicin 50\u2009mg/m^2^, cisplatin 60\u2009mg/m^2^ and 5\u2010fluorouracil 200\u2009mg/m^2^ or capecitabine 625\u2009mg/m^2^ (ECF/X regimen). Definitive chemoradiotherapy was offered to patients with localized squamous cell carcinoma and those with adenocarcinoma deemed unsuitable for surgery because of disease extent and/or medical co\u2010morbidity[14](#bjs550277-bib-0014){ref-type=\"ref\"}, [15](#bjs550277-bib-0015){ref-type=\"ref\"}.\n\nThe standard surgical approach was subtotal transthor\u2010acic oesophagectomy (TTO), as described by Lewis[16](#bjs550277-bib-0016){ref-type=\"ref\"} and Tanner[17](#bjs550277-bib-0017){ref-type=\"ref\"}. Transhiatal oesophagectomy (THO), as described by Orringer[18](#bjs550277-bib-0018){ref-type=\"ref\"}, was used selectively in patients with adenocarcinoma of the lower third of the oesophagus who had significant cardiorespiratory co\u2010morbidity, cT1--3\u2009N0 disease. A modified extended D2 lymphadenectomy (preserving the pancreas and spleen where possible) was performed.\n\nEthical approval was sought, but the chair of the Cardiff and Vale University Health Board ethics committee confirmed that individual patient consent was not required to report clinical outcomes alone, and no formal approval was necessary.\n\nClinicopathological characteristics {#bjs550277-sec-0007}\n-----------------------------------\n\nTumours were staged using the seventh edition of the AJCC/UICC TNM staging system. Pathological factors were recorded from pathology reports issued at the time of surgery, and included tumour differentiation, margin status and the number of lymph nodes with and without metastasis. The TRG was quantified using the Mandard system[19](#bjs550277-bib-0019){ref-type=\"ref\"} by a histopathologist with a special interest in oesophagogastric cancer. Briefly, Mandard TRGs range from 1 to 5, based on the ratio of fibrosis to viable cancerous cells[5](#bjs550277-bib-0005){ref-type=\"ref\"}, [19](#bjs550277-bib-0019){ref-type=\"ref\"}. In keeping with the Oesophageal Cancer Clinical And Molecular Stratification (OCCAMS) reporting methodology, TRGs of 1 and 2 were considered to constitute good response, with TRGs of 3, 4 and 5 constituting poor response[5](#bjs550277-bib-0005){ref-type=\"ref\"}.\n\nRoutine laboratory measurements of haemoglobin, whole white cell count, neutrophil, lymphocyte and platelet counts at the time of diagnosis were recorded. Derivate measurements of systemic inflammation were constructed by calculating the NLR and PLR[7](#bjs550277-bib-0007){ref-type=\"ref\"}, [20](#bjs550277-bib-0020){ref-type=\"ref\"}.\n\nPatients were followed up at regular intervals of 3\u2009months in the first year and 6\u2009months thereafter. In the event that patients developed symptoms suggestive of recurrent disease, investigations were undertaken sooner. Follow\u2010up surveillance was conducted for 5\u2009years or until death, whichever was sooner. Overall survival was calculated from time of diagnosis to the date of death or censoring. Disease\u2010free survival was measured from the date of surgery to the date of recurrence or censoring. The time of recurrence was taken as the date of the confirmatory investigation, on an intention\u2010to\u2010treat basis. Death certification was obtained from the Office for National Statistics via the Cancer Network Information System Cymru.\n\nStatistical analysis {#bjs550277-sec-0008}\n--------------------\n\nGrouped data were expressed as median (i.q.r.) values, and non\u2010parametric methodology was used throughout. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was employed to assess the predictive value of continuous variables with the primary outcome measure. ROC analysis was also used to determine dichotomization thresholds for poor Mandard TRGs, as described by Youden[21](#bjs550277-bib-0021){ref-type=\"ref\"}. Univariable and multivariable logistical regression analysis was used to identify independent associations of categorical variables with poor Mandard TRGs. Variables with *P* \\<\u20090\u00b7100 were included in the model using backward conditional methodology. Patient demographics were analysed between the treatment modalities by means of \u03c7^2^ or non\u2010parametric tests, including the Mann--Whitney *U* test. These tests were also employed in the analysis of disease recurrence and time to recurrence for the treatment groups.\n\nOverall survival was measured from the date of diagnosis, and disease\u2010free survival from date of surgery. This approach was adopted in the randomized trials to allow for the variable interval to surgery after diagnosis, depending on whether NAC was prescribed[22](#bjs550277-bib-0022){ref-type=\"ref\"}. As in the trials, events resulting in a failure to complete curative treatment, such as not proceeding to surgery, open and close laparotomy, palliative resection and in\u2010hospital mortality, were assumed to have occurred at this landmark time, in order to maintain the intention\u2010to\u2010treat analysis. Cumulative survival was calculated according to the Kaplan--Meier method, with differences between groups analysed using the log rank test. A univariable analysis examining factors influencing survival was performed initially by the life\u2010table method of Kaplan and Meier, and factors with associations found to be significant at the *P* \\<\u20090\u00b7010 level were retained in a Cox proportional hazards model using backward conditional methodology to assess the prognostic value of individual variables.\n\nAll statistical analysis was performed in SPSS\u00ae Statistics v25.0.0.0 (IBM, Armonk, New York, USA) with extension R.\n\nResults {#bjs550277-sec-0009}\n=======\n\nA total of 136 patients with OAC were identified and underwent surgery after NAC; the operative approach was open in 120 patients with 16 patients undergoing laparoscopically assisted surgery. Details of patients\\' clinicopathological factors can be found in *Table* [1](#bjs550277-tbl-0001){ref-type=\"table\"}. Their median age was 68 (i.q.r. 63--73) years; 106 (77\u00b79 per cent) were men and 30 (22\u00b71 per cent) were women. Twenty\u2010three patients (16\u00b79 per cent) had a good pathological response to NAC (TRG 1--2); the Mandard TRG groupings were: TRG\u20091, 18 (13\u00b72 per cent); TRG\u20092, five (3\u00b77 per cent); TRG\u20093, six (4\u00b74 per cent); TRG\u20094, 56 (41\u00b72 per cent); and TRG\u20095, 51 (37\u00b75 per cent). During follow\u2010up, 36 patients (26\u00b75 per cent) developed cancer recurrence and 69 (50\u00b77 per cent) died. Median follow\u2010up of survivors was 27 (range 6--60) months. Around two\u2010thirds of the patients were followed up for at least 5\u2009years or until death.\n\n###### \n\nClinicopathological patient factors\n\n                                           No. of patients (*n* = 136)\n  --------------------------------------- -----------------------------\n  **Age (years)**                         \n  \\<\u200965                                             46 (33\u00b78)\n  66--75                                            68 (50\u00b70)\n  \\>\u200975                                             22 (16\u00b72)\n  **Sex ratio (F**\u2009:\u2009**M)**                         30\u2009:\u2009106\n  **Operative approach**                            *n* = 113\n  TTO                                               71 (62\u00b78)\n  THO                                               42 (37\u00b72)\n  **Neutrophil**\u2009:\u2009**lymphocyte ratio**   \n  \\<\u20092\u00b725                                           36 (26\u00b75)\n  \u2265\u20092\u00b725                                           100 (73\u00b75)\n  **pT category**                         \n  pT0                                               11 (8\u00b71)\n  pT1                                               10 (7\u00b74)\n  pT2                                               10 (7\u00b74)\n  pT3                                               69 (50\u00b77)\n  pT4                                               13 (9\u00b76)\n  No resection                                      23 (16\u00b79)\n  **pN category**                         \n  pN0                                               35 (25\u00b77)\n  pN1                                               34 (25\u00b70)\n  pN2                                               26 (19\u00b71)\n  pN3                                               18 (13\u00b72)\n  No resection                                      23 (16\u00b79)\n  **Mandard TRG**                         \n  Good                                              23 (16\u00b79)\n  Poor                                             113 (83\u00b71)\n  **Differentiation**                     \n  Well or moderate                                  64 (47\u00b71)\n  Poor                                              72 (52\u00b79)\n  **CRM**                                 \n  Negative                                          58 (42\u00b76)\n  Positive                                          55 (40\u00b74)\n  No resection                                      23 (16\u00b79)\n  **Lymph node yield**                              *n* = 113\n  \\<\u200915                                             43 (38\u00b71)\n  \u2265\u200915                                              70 (61\u00b79)\n\nValues in parentheses are percentages.

The median value for NLR was 3\u00b700 (i.q.r. 2\u00b715--3\u00b789). NLR was strongly associated with a poorer Mandard TRG (AUC 0\u00b771, 95 per cent c.i. 0\u00b758 to 0\u00b783; *P* = 0\u00b7002) (*Fig*. [1](#bjs550277-fig-0001){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Using the Youden index, the optimal dichotomization threshold was 2\u00b725, with 70\u00b75 per cent considered to have a raised NLR. This gave sensitivity and specificity values of 80\u00b75 and 60\u00b79 per cent respectively. To adjust for potential confounding, a binary logistic regression model was developed to include the clinical factors available to the MDT at the point of commencing neoadjuvant therapy (*Table* [3](#bjs550277-tbl-0003){ref-type=\"table\"}).\n\n###### \n\nAssociation between pretreatment markers of systemic inflammatory response and poor Mandard tumour regression grade\n\n                                                        No. of patients with marker level[\u2020](#bjs550277-note-0006){ref-type=\"fn\"}   ROC analysis                           \n  -------------------------------- ------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------- ---- ------------------- -------\n  Haemoglobin (g/l)                  138 (128--148)                                        33                                           103        0    0\u00b747 (0\u00b733, 0\u00b762)   0\u00b7699\n  White cell count (\u00d7\u200910^9^/l)       7\u00b76 (6\u00b72--8\u00b71)                                         2                                           124        10   0\u00b759 (0\u00b746, 0\u00b772)   0\u00b7158\n  Neutrophil count (\u00d7\u200910^9^/l)       5\u00b70 (3\u00b79--6\u00b71)                                         2                                           118        16   0\u00b768 (0\u00b756, 0\u00b780)   0\u00b7008\n  Lymphocyte count (\u00d7\u200910^9^/l)       1\u00b77 (1\u00b73--2\u00b71)                                         8                                           123        5    0\u00b740 (0\u00b725, 0\u00b754)   0\u00b7115\n  Platelet count (\u00d7\u200910^9^/l)         281 (233--330)                                         3                                           123        10   0\u00b752 (0\u00b740, 0\u00b765)   0\u00b7691\n  Neutrophil\u2009to\u2009lymphocyte ratio    3\u00b700 (2\u00b715--3\u00b789)                                                                                                   0\u00b771 (0\u00b758, 0\u00b783)   0\u00b7002\n  Platelet\u2009to\u2009lymphocyte ratio       160 (122--198)                                                                                                     0\u00b766 (0\u00b752, 0\u00b779)   0\u00b7019\n\nValues in parentheses are 95 per cent confidence intervals unless indicated otherwise;\n\nvalues are median (i.q.r.).\n\nBased on local thresholds.\n\nAUC, area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.\n\n![**Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis of neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio and Mandard tumour response grade**\\\nArea under the ROC curve (AUC) = 0\u00b771 (95 per cent c.i. 0\u00b758 to 0\u00b783; *P* = 0\u00b7002).](BJS5-4-416-g001){#bjs550277-fig-0001}\n\n###### \n\nLogistic regression analysis of preoperative factors associated with poor Mandard tumour regression grade\n\n                                                              Univariable analysis   Multivariable analysis                        \n  ---------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------- ------------------------ --------------------- ----------\n  Age (\\<\u200965 *versus* 66--75 *versus*\u2009\\>\u200975\u2009years)             1\u00b711 (0\u00b758, 2\u00b715)            \u2002\u20020\u00b7753                                \n  Sex (F *versus* M)                                           1\u00b731 (0\u00b747, 3\u00b768)            \u2002\u20020\u00b7610                                \n  Differentiation (well/moderate *versus* poor)               17\u00b709 (3\u00b782, 76\u00b755)           \\<\u20090\u00b7001          15\u00b792 (3\u00b742, 74\u00b702)   \\<\u20090\u00b7001\n  cTNM (1 *versus* 2 *versus* 3 *versus* 4)                    1\u00b738 (0\u00b776, 2\u00b748)            \u2002\u20020\u00b7289                                \n  Neutrophil\u2009to\u2009lymphocyte ratio (\\<\u20092\u00b725 *versus*\u2009\u2265\u20092\u00b725)     6\u00b743 (2\u00b747, 16\u00b777)           \\<\u20090\u00b7001          5\u00b786 (2\u00b703, 16\u00b792)    \u2002\u20020\u00b7001\n\nValues in parentheses are 95 per cent confidence intervals.\n\nThe relationship between clinicopathological factors and overall survival is shown in *Table* [4](#bjs550277-tbl-0004){ref-type=\"table\"}, and that between clinicopathological factors and disease\u2010free survival in *Table* [5](#bjs550277-tbl-0005){ref-type=\"table\"}.

Based on a dichotomization threshold of 2\u00b725, 100 of the 136 patients (73\u00b75 per cent) had a raised NLR, and were nearly sixfold more likely to have a poor TRG response to NAC. Median overall survival in patients with a low NLR was, on average, 34\u2009months longer than that in patients with a high NLR. Similarly, 5\u2010year disease\u2010free and overall survival rates in patients with a low NLR were around 80 and 50 per cent respectively, approximately double those of patients with a high NLR.\n\nThe relationship between the SIR and TRG in oesophageal cancer has been described previously[23](#bjs550277-bib-0023){ref-type=\"ref\"}, in a study in which no association between NLR and TRG was identified. Key differences in methodology from that in the present study may account for these different findings. The definition of good TRG response differed. In the earlier study[23](#bjs550277-bib-0023){ref-type=\"ref\"}, patients with TRG\u20091--3 were considered good responders, whereas in the present study TRG 1--2 was considered to represent a good response. The OCCAMS research consortium currently favours the TRG\u20091--2 as indicative of good response[5](#bjs550277-bib-0005){ref-type=\"ref\"}. The statistical methods also differed. The earlier study[23](#bjs550277-bib-0023){ref-type=\"ref\"} looked only at differences in NLR measurements between responders and non\u2010responders (2\u00b726 *versus* 2\u00b773; *P* = 0\u00b7127), but did not examine the predictive value of NLR by ROC curve or logistic regression analysis. Statistical nuances may, of course, be overanalysed, but half of the TRG responders in the earlier study had a NLR below 2\u00b726, which implicitly supports the critical threshold of 2\u00b725 employed in the present study. At the very least, markers of SIR require further evaluation.\n\nThe prognostic power of SIR in relation to neoadjuvant therapies has been reported previously, involving rectal[24](#bjs550277-bib-0024){ref-type=\"ref\"}, [25](#bjs550277-bib-0025){ref-type=\"ref\"}, ovarian[26](#bjs550277-bib-0026){ref-type=\"ref\"}, lung[27](#bjs550277-bib-0027){ref-type=\"ref\"} and breast[28](#bjs550277-bib-0028){ref-type=\"ref\"} cancers. A high mGPS was associated with poor response to NAC in rectal cancer (odds ratio (OR) 0\u00b718, *P* = 0\u00b7006), and low NLR was associated with a good pathological response (OR 0\u00b727, *P* = 0\u00b7046), although this did not retain independent significance in multivariable analysis[24](#bjs550277-bib-0024){ref-type=\"ref\"}. Although other studies have not specifically examined the role of SIR\\'s association with pathological response to NAC, preoperative NLR has been reported to predict overall survival, with high NLR values being associated with poor survival[29](#bjs550277-bib-0029){ref-type=\"ref\"}. Exactly why SIR should be associated with poor response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in OAC is not understood, although *in vivo* and *in vitro* evidence suggests that activation of the JAK/STAT3 (Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription) pathway by interleukin 6 may play a role in chemoresistance[30](#bjs550277-bib-0030){ref-type=\"ref\"}, [31](#bjs550277-bib-0031){ref-type=\"ref\"}.\n\nThere are a number of inherent limitations to all studies of this type, which have been reported previously[7](#bjs550277-bib-0007){ref-type=\"ref\"}, [32](#bjs550277-bib-0032){ref-type=\"ref\"}, [33](#bjs550277-bib-0033){ref-type=\"ref\"}. Cohort size was modest, and stage\u2010by\u2010stage subanalysis was therefore impractical. The patients represented a selected cohort (most had undergone a potentially curative oesophagogastrectomy) and were consequently not representative of all patients diagnosed with oesophageal cancer; indeed, only about one\u2010quarter of all patients in South Wales with OAC undergo potentially curative surgery[34](#bjs550277-bib-0034){ref-type=\"ref\"}. The strengths of the study, nevertheless, included robust follow\u2010up data with no patient lost to follow\u2010up, a reasonable duration of follow\u2010up, and accurate causes and dates of death. A National Health Service laboratory using standardized techniques performed the serum analyses and histopathological examinations, so reproducing these results should be easy. Patients were recruited from a consecutive series diagnosed with OAC, from a single UK geographical region, all treated by the same group of specialists, using a standardized staging algorithm and operative techniques, with internationally recognized and published key performance indicators[10](#bjs550277-bib-0010){ref-type=\"ref\"}.\n\nDespite improvements in staging and surgical technique, approximately half of the patients who undergo potentially curative oesophagectomy for cancer will suffer disease recurrence[13](#bjs550277-bib-0013){ref-type=\"ref\"}, [22](#bjs550277-bib-0022){ref-type=\"ref\"}. Determination of the NLR, derived and calculated from absolute counts of serum lymphocytes and neutrophils, is performed routinely during preoperative blood profile work, and is readily available. The findings suggest that SIR offers a novel therapeutic target for patients susceptible to NAC resistance and cancer recurrence. Incorporation of the NLR into management pathways is presently limited by inconsistent dichotomization thresholds. Adequately powered studies comparing critical dichotomization or categorization thresholds are needed. Given the association between SIR and relative chemoresistance, the identification of the group with high NLR would suggest that these patients might benefit from alternatives to NAC at the outset.\n\nCollaborators {#bjs550277-sec-0011}\n=============\n\nMembers of the South\u2010East Wales Oesophagogastric Cancer Collaborative: G.
