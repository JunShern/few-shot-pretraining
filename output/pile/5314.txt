    "text": "Senate Republicans are heading for a showdown on their years-long campaign pledge to repeal and replace ObamaCare without a clear path to passing the legislation.\n\nGOP senators are set to return to Washington on Monday evening still confused about whether the endgame is to repeal ObamaCare with a delayed replacement or try to move them together in one bill.\n\nLeadership is pressuring rank-and-file lawmakers to agree to take up the House-passed healthcare bill, which is being used as a vehicle for any action, without knowing what the final outcome will be.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Asking what the first amendment is going to be actually misses the point, because anybody that's got a better idea can offer that and there's no way to stop them,\u201d said Sen. John Cornyn John CornynTumultuous court battle upends fight for Senate Texas Democrats roll out first wave of planned digital ads as Election Day nears Calls grow for Biden to expand election map in final sprint MORE (R-Texas), when pressed on whether Republicans want to just repeal or instead repeal and replace ObamaCare.\n\nBut GOP leadership has almost no room for error on the vote to start debate, which is expected to occur on Tuesday.\n\nRepublicans have a 52-seat majority and will need at least 50 senators to agree to take up the House bill. That margin is even narrower if Sen. John McCain John Sidney McCainBiden's six best bets in 2016 Trump states Replacing Justice Ginsburg could depend on Arizona's next senator The Hill's Morning Report - Sponsored by Facebook - Washington on edge amid SCOTUS vacancy MORE (R-Ariz.) remains out of Washington after his office announced last week that he had been diagnosed with brain cancer.\n\nWith McCain gone and all other 99 senators voting, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellGraham: GOP will confirm Trump's Supreme Court nominee before the election Trump puts Supreme Court fight at center of Ohio rally The Memo: Dems face balancing act on SCOTUS fight MORE (R-Ky.) can only afford to lose one GOP senator.\n\nThough top administration officials are making an additional 11th-hour push to try to get several undecided senators to agree to at least start debate on\u2014if not ultimately pass\u2014the healthcare bill, leadership still appears short of the 50 votes for either proposal.\n\nFour GOP senators came out in opposition to a recent version of the Senate\u2019s repeal-and-replace bill, known as the Better Care Reconciliation Act. A Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analysis released late last week found that an additional 22 million Americans would become uninsured by 2026 under the legislation.\n\nThree senators have publicly opposed moving a repeal-only bill, though Sen. Lamar Alexander Andrew (Lamar) Lamar AlexanderGraham: GOP will confirm Trump's Supreme Court nominee before the election The Hill's Morning Report - Sponsored by Facebook - Washington on edge amid SCOTUS vacancy This week: Supreme Court fight over Ginsburg's seat upends Congress's agenda MORE (R-Tenn.), the chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, hinted that roughly a dozen more senators could be privately opposed to repealing with a delayed replacement bill.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there are 40 votes to repeal [ObamaCare] and say to the American people \u2018well trust us to come up with something in the next couple of years.\u2019 I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a very good idea,\u201d Alexander told reporters last week.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if GOP senators, particularly several moderates, will agree to take up the House bill without knowing which path leadership wants to take. Many key senators to watch said late last week that they weren\u2019t sure how they would vote because they didn\u2019t know what plan leadership wanted.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know whether we're proceeding to the House bill, a new version of the Senate bill, the old version of the Senate bill, the 2015 repeal and hope that we come up with something in two years bill, I truly don\u2019t,\u201d Sen. Susan Collins Susan Margaret CollinsGraham: GOP will confirm Trump's Supreme Court nominee before the election Gardner signals support for taking up Supreme Court nominee this year Tumultuous court battle upends fight for Senate MORE (R-Maine) told reporters.\n\nAsked how he could get moderates to help them overcome the initial hurdle without knowing the final product, Cornyn added that they have the \u201cultimate protection\u201d of being able to vote against the healthcare legislation on final passage.\n\n\u201cSo rather than doing that on the front end my hope is they decide to proceed to debate the bill and amend it,\u201d he said.\n\nIf senators get on the healthcare bill they will have 20 hours of debate in addition to a free-wheeling \u201cvote-a-rama.\u201d During the hours-long marathon session any senator can force a vote on any amendment.\n\nThe Senate bill hit another stumbling block from the parliamentarian, according to an outline released Friday from Sen. Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersJacobin editor: Primarying Schumer would force him to fight Trump's SCOTUS nominee Trump campaign plays up Biden's skills ahead of Cleveland debate: 'He's actually quite good' Young voters backing Biden by 2:1 margin: poll MORE (I-Vt.), who is the ranking member of the Budget Committee.\n\nThe parliamentarian has ruled that key provisions including a year-long defunding of federal funds for Planned Parenthood and restrictions on using tax credits to buy insurance plans that cover abortions don\u2019t comply with Senate rules and could be removed from the bill, according to Sanders\u2019s office.\n\nStill under review by the parliamentarian is a key provision that helped bring on board conservatives that would allow states to waive ObamaCare\u2019s rules on what benefits need to be covered by health insurance or requirements on covering pre-existing conditions.\n\nRepublicans quickly noted that the findings were tied to an earlier version of the bill, and weren't official rulings\u2014meaning they still had time to try to change impacted parts of the legislation.\n\nLeadership did get one potential boost to at least starting debate on a healthcare bill late last week.\n\nSen. Rand Paul Randal (Rand) Howard PaulSecond GOP senator to quarantine after exposure to coronavirus GOP senator to quarantine after coronavirus exposure The Hill's Morning Report - Sponsored by National Industries for the Blind - Trump seeks to flip 'Rage' narrative; Dems block COVID-19 bill MORE, who has long been viewed as one of the caucus\u2019s most entrenched \u201cno\u201d votes, said he would be willing to vote \u201cyes\u201d on the motion to proceed if he can get a deal on amendments.\n\nThe Kentucky Republican floated that Senate leadership should guarantee votes on some of the caucus's most prominent healthcare proposals \u2014 including repeal-only, repeal-and-replace and a bill created by Sens. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) and Collins\u2014 as a way to get him on board.\n\n\"I think they're pretty equal in support. Let's do a random selection. Let's have three or four of them, put them in random order, the first day, equal billing. I think that's a compromise. I'm willing to get on the bill,\" he said.\n\nBut Paul said that as of late last week leadership hadn\u2019t accepted his proposal.\n\nBorder wall funding\n\nThe House is slated to consider a national security-themed spending package as one of its last agenda items before leaving for the August recess at the end of this week.\n\nThe bill includes funding for the Departments of Defense, Energy and Veterans Affairs, as well as legislative branch operations like the Capitol Police.\n\nHouse GOP leaders are expected to add $1.6 billion for the U.S.-Mexico border wall promised by President Trump Donald John TrumpBubba Wallace to be driver of Michael Jordan, Denny Hamlin NASCAR team Graham: GOP will confirm Trump's Supreme Court nominee before the election Southwest Airlines, unions call for six-month extension of government aid MORE during the 2016 campaign.\n\nGiven the inclusion of funds for the border wall, the legislation stands next to no chance in the Senate given Democrats\u2019 likelihood to filibuster. But its passage in the House will serve as an opening salvo in the spending fight that awaits lawmakers in September when they will have to find a way to avoid a government shutdown at the end of the month.\n\nMembers of both parties will likely submit hundreds of amendments to the spending package.\n\nNot every amendment will get a vote. House GOP leaders will select which amendments can get debate and a vote on the floor.\n\nThey\u2019re unlikely to greenlight amendments like blocking money for Trump\u2019s wall, as proposed by Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.), or preventing any funds from benefiting Trump\u2019s businesses as submitted by Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.).\n\nAnother controversial addition could be if GOP leaders allow a vote on an amendment from Rep. Vicky Hartzler (R-Mo.) to prevent the Pentagon from paying for service members\u2019 gender reassignment surgeries.\n\nGOP leaders previously granted Hartzler\u2019s amendment a vote during consideration of the annual defense policy bill two weeks ago. But it failed by a vote of 209-214, thanks to 24 mostly centrist Republicans who joined with Democrats to defeat it.\n\nThe House Rules Committee, which is controlled by GOP leaders, will meet on Monday and Tuesday to make decisions on amendments.\n\n\n\nRussia sanctions\n\nThe House will vote Tuesday on a deal unveiled over the weekend to impose sanctions on Russia, Iran and North Korea.\n\n\n\nIts consideration will come amid the multiple investigations of whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russian officials as part of its attempts to interfere in the 2016 election.\n\n\n\nSenators originally passed the bill by a vote of 98-2 last month, but it stalled in the House for weeks mostly due to procedural hangups.\n\n\n\nHouse Democrats had objected to a provision requested by GOP leaders to allow only the majority party to force votes on resolutions to block the Trump administration from lifting sanctions.\n\n\n\nOil and gas companies had also expressed concern about provisions targeting Russian energy pipelines and warned they could inadvertently harm American projects abroad.\n\n\n\nUnder the deal, either the House majority or minority leader can introduce a resolution of disapproval to prevent the Trump administration from easing sanctions.\n\n\n\nThe White House had pushed GOP lawmakers to water down the congressional oversight provisions in the pursuit of flexibility with sanctions policy. But President Trump is poised to be presented with legislation that disregards his administration's request.\n\n\n\nThe sanctions package will be considered under an expedited process that requires a two-thirds majority for passage. That threshold also means it will be veto-proof.\n\n\n\nAssuming the Senate clears the legislation by a similar margin as last time, Trump could be faced with the first veto override of his presidency if he refuses to sign it.\n\n\n\nThe legislation passed by the Senate originally only applied to Iran and Russia, but House negotiators added North Korea to the package. The House had passed a separate North Korea sanctions bill by a 419-1 vote this spring.\n\n\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), while supportive of the North Korea sanctions, expressed concern that the addition could slow down Senate consideration.\n\n\n\n\"It is essential that the addition of North Korea to this package does not prevent Congress from immediately enacting Russia sanctions legislation and sending it to the President's desk before the August recess,\" Pelosi said in a statement.\n\nKushner to interview on the Hill\n\nPresident Trump's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner is slated to interview with the House Intelligence Committee on Tuesday amid that panel's Russia probe. His appearance will come a day after he is reportedly expected to talk to the Senate Intelligence Committee behind closed doors.\n\nDonald Trump Jr. and former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort have also reached a deal with the Senate Judiciary Committee to avoid appearing for a public hearing this week, lawmakers said. The two have agreed to interviews and provide documents to the panel, the committee said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Senate committee said Friday that it was subpoenaing Glenn Simpson, the co-founder of a firm tied to a salacious dossier containing largely unverified opposition research on President Trump, to appear at the hearing Wednesday.\n\nLawmakers are eager to hear from Trump Jr. and Manafort following revelations that they met with a Russian lawyer claiming to have damaging information about Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonJoe Biden looks to expand election battleground into Trump country Biden leads Trump by 12 points among Catholic voters: poll The Hill's Campaign Report: Biden goes on offense MORE during last year\u2019s campaign.\n\nSens.
