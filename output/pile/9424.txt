That\u2019s the narrative being peddled by the Rajoy government and all those who desperately need it to win December\u2019s do-or-die general elections, including Spain\u2019s big banks, corporate giants, and the Troika of international creditors. And they will do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to keep the narrative intact.\n\nJust last week the European Commission postponed negative opinion on the Spanish budget for 2016 \u2013 a budget that has been drawn up with one basic goal: to buy off as many cheap, gullible voters as it takes to tilt the electoral balance in the government\u2019s favor. It\u2019s a classic ruse as old as democracy itself: austerity gets suspended, spending is hiked, and tax cuts are brought forward. And then everyone goes to vote feeling just a little bit richer.\n\nWhen Europe\u2019s Economic and Taxation Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici told the press last week that Madrid was at \u201crisk of non-compliance\u201d with the Stability and Growth Pact \u2013 not only for 2016 but for 2015 as well \u2014 he was quickly silenced by both the Commission and Germany\u2019s Eonomy Minister Wolfgang Schauble. Once again, whatever it takes.\n\nThen today, after a week of bumbling controversy, came news of yet another U-turn with the Commission effectively admitting that Moscovici had been right all along: the Spanish government\u2019s 2016 budget was just a little on the optimistic side.\n\nDespite all the gushing reviews and rampant economic misinformation, including last week\u2019s conveniently timed credit rating upgrade by Standard and Poor\u2019s, not everybody\u2019s buying the government\u2019s rose-tinted version of reality. Not this time. You can hardly blame them given the real, on-the-ground reality of Spain\u2019s economic \u201crecovery\u201d:\n\n1. Achieving Massive Growth in\u2026 Poverty.\n\nOne in four Spanish workers is poor, according to a study by the International Labor Organization. The number of people earning less than 60% of the average salary increased by four percentage points between 2000 and 2014, from 18% to 22.2%. This year the number of households with no official source of income reached a historic peak of 770,000 \u2013 close to 5% of all households.\n\nSpain has become a society that boasts of economic growth as entire families and communities are excluded from the economy, wrote Caritas, the Catholic Church\u2019s official organization for charity and social relief in Spain, in a damning 2015 report on the state of the Spanish economy. If it wasn\u2019t for the so-called black economy, long the bane of governments all over the planet, Spain\u2019s social fabric would have snapped long ago.\n\n2. Deactivating the Population.\n\nUnemployment may have fallen in the last four years from 26.5% to 22%, but the active population is shrinking at a much faster rate than the growth in job creation, notes Caritas. The main reason for this contraction is the mass exodus of foreign workers.\n\nSpain also continues to suffer from a brain drain as its best and brightest seek opportunities in other European countries, such as Germany and the U.K., or in Latin American nations like Brazil, Argentina or Mexico. \u201cThe recession has led to the biggest migration in Spain\u2019s history,\u201d the Bank of Spain lamented in a recent report. The banking institution pointed out that since 2010, the brain drain has been of around 400,000 people annually.\n\n3. No Country for Young Men.\n\nMost of the new jobs being created are not for the nation\u2019s job-starved youth which, despite Rajoy\u2019s much-touted \u201ceconomic miracle,\u201d still have a one-in-two chance of being unemployed. Most businesses that are hiring prefer to recruit workers with extensive experience, meaning that those just out of school or university end up trapped in the \u201cno experience, no job; no job, no experience\u201d loop.\n\nEffectively excluded from the official salaried job market, many graduates have little choice but to jump on the eternal internship carousel, as I reported in No Country for Young Men:\n\nIn the complete absence of any kind of inspection regime, young workers are being shifted from one internship contract to another. Few of them will ever get hired full-time, and those that are, are invariably given a short-term contract that, once expired, is replaced by yet another.\n\nEven for the select few fortunate enough to find real, lasting employment, the salary they pick up the end of each month is likely to be a hell of a lot smaller than it would have done before the crisis. According to the OECD, the average monthly salary of young Spanish workers decreased from 1,210 euros in 2008 to 890 euros in 2013 \u2013 a 35% drop in real terms.\n\n4. Ubiquitous \u201cPrecarity.\u201d\n\nThe percentage of part-time work in Spain grew from 12% in 2008 to 17.4% in the fourth quarter of 2014. As Caritas\u2019 report puts it, \u201cinstead of creating more jobs, we are chopping them into ever smaller pieces.\u201d Since the government\u2019s labor reform act of 2013, Spain has become a Mecca for mini-jobs. Statistics provided by the Ministry of Employment show that of the 1.24 million employment contracts signed in August, only 6.4% were for permanent jobs while more than one in four contracts were for jobs lasting less than seven days.\n\n5. Lost Decade.\n\nWhile all the talk is of GDP growth, the actual level of production registered in 2014, after a year and a half of so-called \u201crecovery,\u201d was still 5% below the level registered in 2008. Given the evolution of this and a host of other indicators, some experts have began using the term \u201cLost Decade\u201d to describe Spain\u2019s post-crisis period. Hardly cause for champagne.\n\n6. Ugly Long-Term Fundamentals.\n\nThe Spanish government\u2019s management of the economy, under the Troika\u2019s ever watchful and generally approving gaze, has significantly reduced the Spanish economy\u2019s long-term growth prospects. Gross capital formation, as a proportion of GDP, is now down 14 percentage points since 2007; funds for research, development and innovation shrank from \u20ac321.90 per inhabitant in 2009 to \u20ac279.30 in 2013.\n\nFinally \u2013 and most importantly \u2013 the root causes of the crisis, far from being resolved or for that matter even tackled, have actually deteriorated, notes Caritas. Inequality and poverty have reached unprecedented levels. The agents of big finance and their twisted logic continue to dominate the economic debate, while the productive, commercial and technological differences between the North and South of Europe continue to widen.\n\nIn Spain the Rajoy government has achieved an impressive economic growth rate just before the general elections. Its timing is impeccable, but it is unlikely to be enough, for the simple reason that growth alone is rarely enough, as the late British business magnate James Goldsmith warned in a 1994 interview with Charlie Rose:\n\n\u201cThe economy is there to serve the fundamental needs of society, which are prosperity, stability and contentment\u2026 If you have a situation whereby the economy grows but you create poverty and unemployment and you destabilise society, you\u2019re in trouble.\u201d\n\nPost navigation\n\n6 comments for \u201cSix Nagging Facts About Spain\u2019s \u201cRecovery\u201d\u201d\n\nThe financiers and politician hacks are like lamprey taking the hosts last blood.\n\nAC\n\nOct 13, 2015 at 11:53 pm\n\nThe important thing is that reality not intrude upon Spain\u2019s ruling class.\n\nI wonder if they are in denial about how bad things are, or if they just don\u2019t care, and how much abuse the average Spaniards are going to tolerate before the killing starts up again.\n\nd'Cynic\n\nOct 14, 2015 at 1:23 am\n\nDemocracy should be called Democracy LLP.\n\njohn\n\nOct 15, 2015 at 9:00 am\n\nIn all my years backwards and forwards to Spain, I have yet to hear of any personal transaction by sensible people (from building another storey on the house, to hiring a car, to buying groceries), that isn\u2019t done in cash.\n\nglen\n\nOct 18, 2015 at 4:38 am\n\nas long as the footballers and other sports people get paid mega salaries everything is ok, get rid of penalty rates to allow a pay rise for tennis players at this seasons Australian tennis open,\nif \u2018the people\u2019 keep supporting this distorted system then none of them can complain.\n\nScot\n\nOct 19, 2015 at 12:34 pm\n\nYou mention Spain\u2019s black economy. There is a vibrant barter society in the heartland of Spain. So, as the politicians ruin the economy, the people will survive. That\u2019s how the 25% who have no income survive right now."
