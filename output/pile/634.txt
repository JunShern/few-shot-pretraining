    "text": "The biggest stars in music history came out to celebrate Berry Gordy's journey from Detroit to Broadway when 'Motown: The Musical' hit the stage last night. See Tracee Ellis Ross,Diana Ross, Stevie Wonder, Smokey Robinson and other MOTOWN Legends walk the red carpet inside....\n\nBefore Diddy, Jay-Z, Baby, Master P,Jermaine Dupri or any other hit-making record label owner you can name check....there was Berry Gordy. And last night, Mr. Gordy watched his life come full circle as the story of him turning Detroit aka The Motor City into \"Motown\" made its debut on Broadway at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre in NYC.\n\n\"Motown: The Musical\"is about the history and love-story style legacy of Motown AND the musical acts it turned into international superstars. Though reviews about the musical have been mixed, there's no denying the contribution of Motown and acts like The Supremes, The Four Tops, The Temptations and others and beyond. So it's best you go see it for yourself!\n\nOn the red carpet.....\n\nFashion hottie Tracee Ellis Ross came out to support both Berry and her mom. And she looked amazing...even though we're trying to figure out that bra(less) situation up top...\n\nBerry Gordy proudly posed on the red carpet with his former muse Diana Ross (who's also the mother of his daughter Rhonda Ross) and his new muse and arm candy Eskedar Gobeze.\n\nDiana, whom most folks would call was Motown's First Lady, also posed with Berry and Stefan Kendal Gordy (Berry's son and a part of LMFAO) and Jada Grace (one of Stefan's new artists).\n\nThen Miss Ross posed with cast members from the musical.\n\nMary Wilson (who was one of the original members of The Supremes) posed on the red carpet.\n\nDoes Tracee Ellis Ross have a glass eye? Just asking..... Did she get that dress from the back of her Diana's closet? That dress is all wrong. I must say that the old school Motown artists look GREAT for their age (i.e. Gladys Knight, Mary Wells, Smokey Robinson). Sorry, but I have to squint to look at Diana's son-in-law (Rhonda's husband). LAWD.\n\nWTF is going on with Tracy's dress. I know Diana don't like like Rhonda's husband. Diana don't like nothing black unless you own a record company. I think all her daughters are rebelling against her & finding jet black men. I have to make a trip to NY to see the play\n\nThese are indeed some FABULOUS-BLACK folk! Not feeling most of the outfits but these folks are so talented, fashion is a non-issue. Diana Ross is the FIRST d-i-v-a! Gladys Knight & Mary WIlson look GREAT! Love Smokey Robinson, Stevie Wonder, Jesse J & Berry Gordy. Cuba couldn't bother to change OUT of his hoodie??? SMH...\n\nThe only sista that was natural there was Rhonda Ross and the sista LOOKEDDD BEAUTIFULLLL, Gorgeous sista!!!!!!!!! The other older sistas got all that silly ass shit in they head, perfume extra loud and shit, brothas got on them cheap ass 1970 suits. But sistas please take that shit out yall head PLEASE !!!!!!IF NOT NOBODY ELSE DOOOOOOO IT FOR MEEEE!!! The white woman is no longer the standard of beauty you don't have to put that shit in your head to feel good\n\nLook like the elder brotha and sistas had a good time, although it may have been a little tension between some people in the building they still keep it old skool. Alot talented people there unlike today where the singers are mediocre and don't really have soul and niggas be loving that shit. Times are surely changing when these folks are gone , and we're old we gone have niggas saying Beyonce was the greastest and Chris brown made the best music.\n\nfunny thing about time is that it changes! these people are legends but they will also die therefor making room for others to be great! as well as more music! duh! And Beyonce is already on her way to be the greatest...its already happening!ill wait for you to tell me who else would it be...\n\nWell sista, there's a ton of artist better than Beyonce in my opinion!! But hey when it comes to popularity and a majority more people like beyonce. Jill Scott alone is better than beyonce IN MY OPINION, Kem, i mean most neo soul artist sound better than the mainstream artist IN MY OPINION!!!So when it comes to popular culture ok you can give it to herrr but i don't like pop so there it is."
