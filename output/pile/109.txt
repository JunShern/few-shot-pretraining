The powers of the Government of the State of Florida, shall be divided into three distinct departments, and each of them confided to a separate body of Magistracy, to wit: Those which are Legislative to one; those which are Executive to another; and those which are Judicial to another.\n\nSection 2. No person, or collection of persons, being one of those departments, shall exercise any power properly belonging to either of the others, except in the instances expressly provided in this Constitution.\n\n____________\n\nARTICLE III.\n\nExecutive Department.\n\nSection 1. The Supreme Executive Power shall be vested in a Chief Magistrate, who shall be styled the Governor of the State of Florida.\n\nSection 2. The Governor shall be elected for four years, by the qualified electors, at the time and place where they shall vote for Representatives, and shall remain in office until a successor be chosen and qualified, and shall not be eligible to re-election until the expiration of four years thereafter.\n\nSection 3.
