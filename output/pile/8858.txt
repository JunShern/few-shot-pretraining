    "text": "Q:\n\nHow does one effectively negotiate rent?\n\nI'm going to rent an apartment in a major urban area in the next few months.  When I drive around the area where I want to rent I see numerous \"For Rent\" signs.  Also when I look online there are numerous listings.  Given the abundance of properties for rent... and from a short conversation with a real estate agent... I've come to realize that negotiating the amount of monthly rent is not out of the question (and perhaps common?).  How does one effectively negotiate rent?\nI'm open to a variety of ideas including trading a longer lease length for a smaller monthy rent... or paying multiple months in advance in exchange for a lower monthly rent etc.\nCheers!\n\nA:\n\nOne of the best ways to \"win\" any negotiation is to make an offer in which the other guy \"wins\" too.\nGive them something you don't care much about in exchange for something you do care about. (Assuming the \"something\" is of value to them.)\nYou've already hinted at this strategy in your question:\n\nPrepay months in advance.\nLonger lease.\nLonger notice time built into lease termination agreement.\nDo you have a car? Can you give up a parking space?\nAre you a non-smoker? Can you promise not to smoke in the apartment? (This is an expense for the landlord when you move out.)\nDo they allow cats and you don't have cats? Can you promise not to keep cats? (Another expense for the landlord.)\nProbably unlikely to succeed in urban areas where landlords are pros, but in other areas: can you offer to do work for rent reduction? E.g. you are handy and can help with maintenance, or you can mow the lawn, shovel the walk, paint, etc.\nIf they have low occupancy, can you make a deal for referrals?\n\nA:\n\nI'm open to a variety of ideas including trading a longer lease length for a smaller monthy rent... or paying multiple months in advance in exchange for a lower monthly rent etc.\n\nThese two ideas that you mention are good.\nDo your homework first.  See a few places.  Find out how much they are asking.  Make a note of details such as square footage, appliances, amenities, etc.  Then play them off each other.  Be sure to point out that there are many places available in the area.  Be courteous, but firm and be ready to walk away from a place you like if you are not happy with the deal they are willing (or not willing) to give you.\n\nA:\n\nAnother negotiating technique is to ask for extra items to be included at the base rental rate.\nExamples of \"extras\" in an apartment rental might include monthly rental of a washer/dryer, monthly fees for fitness center access, or higher rent for a good location apartment (top floor/pool side/etc).\nAsk to get one or all of those items included in the rental price they offer you.\nIf they say \"yes\":  You win the extra items at no additional cost.\nIf they say \"no\":  Then challenge them that if they take away the washer/dryer you'll need to pay $50 less rent per month to meet your target price for rent.\n\n"
