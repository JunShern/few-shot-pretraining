    "text": "Most notably, we now know the play will be a sequel and should be considered the series\u2019 \u201ceighth story,\u201d set to take place 19 years later, contradicting early reports predicting the play would be a prequel.\n\nWe\u2019re also now seeing the first images of the play\u2019s official artwork, which shows a child hunched inside a nest that appears to have black wings.\n\nBelow is a brief plot decription about what we can expect from the production:\n\n\u201cIt was always difficult being Harry Potter and it isn\u2019t much easier now that he is an overworked employee of the Ministry of Magic, a husband and father of three school-age children.\n\nWhile Harry grapples with a past that refuses to stay where it belongs, his youngest son Albus must struggle with the weight of a family legacy he never wanted. As past and present fuse ominously, both father and son learn the uncomfortable truth: sometimes, darkness comes from unexpected places.\u201d\n\nPreview performances will officially begin on June 7 and July 30 will mark the world premiere opening night.\n\nThat would be \u201cThe People Smuggler,\u201d by Robin de Crespigny. It tells the story of an Iraqi dissident called Ali Al Jenabi. As a teenager he joined the Shia uprising against Saddam Hussein after the first Iraq war in 1991. He was captured by Saddam\u2019s secret police, sent to Abu Ghraib and tortured. He watched his father being tortured to the point of insanity and thrown into a pit below the madhouse. He saw his kid brother being dismembered.\n\nWhen he got out of Abu Ghraib he tried to join anti-Saddam groups in Kurdistan, but they were too divided by infighting to be effective. So he turned his attentions to trying to get his remaining family out of Iraq. The numerous reverses and betrayals make the plot of \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\u201d look like plain sailing. In Indonesia, he found the operation for shipping refugees to Australia so useless and corrupt that he decided to run it himself. Having eventually got several boats safely to Australia, he found himself tried and imprisoned there for \u201cpeople smuggling.\u201d This is an astonishing story, at times barely credible, but very unsettling.\n\nIn the same week, I read Norman Lewis\u2019s war diary, \u201cNaples \u201944,\u201d an account of his time as an intelligence officer in a city where everyone was starving and two-thirds of the women of nubile age were selling their bodies. It is a wonderful book, droll, shocking and humane.\n\nWhen and where do you like to read?\n\nI read the above two books on a plane, but generally I read in my office, a two-room apartment overlooking a small park in West London, sitting in a hideous though comfortable leather recliner (think Joey in \u201cFriends\u201d). It is death to books to read them in 15-minute bursts in bed late at night when you are tired. I know that for people with real jobs there may be little choice, but the best way to read a 300-page novel is in three or four sittings. I do occasional crash courses to see what\u2019s new in contemporary fiction and have just read Evie Wyld, Scarlett Thomas, Ross Raisin and Adam Foulds.\n\nHaving written one of the post-Ian Fleming Bond books, you must have opinions on 007. Which is your favorite Bond book?\n\nI like the climactic scene in \u201cLive and Let Die\u201d when Bond and the girl are towed behind a speedboat as shark bait. I lost interest in the films after Sean Connery, but I did enjoy \u201cCasino Royale\u201d \u2014 though Daniel Craig looked as though he had been assembled in a factory. Eva Green was very good in it.\n\nAnd now taking on the new Jeeves book, tell us about your favorite P.?G. Wodehouse.\n\nI like all the Jeeves books, the early ones especially. My favorites are \u201cThe Code of the Woosters,\u201d ?\u201cThe Mating Season\u201d and \u201cRight Ho, Jeeves.\u201d But they all have their glories, whether entire plots, set pieces or just single phrases. They depict a world that never truly existed yet in some odd way feels familiar. Heaven may be the cocktail hour at Brinkley Court, with Nobby Hopwood just arriving and Anatole preparing dinner.\n\nOf the books you\u2019ve written, which is your favorite?\n\n\u201cHuman Traces\u201d is the one I would want to be buried with. It\u2019s long and it has some sticky parts, including a couple of lectures. But I like it because it deals with what to me is the great theme: Why are human beings so odd \u2014 and so much odder than any evolutionary theory can explain.\n\nIt took me five years\u2019 research in musty libraries and psychiatric back wards, including a day at Broadmoor high \u2014 security hospital, but I never lost my belief that these tangled lives were both worth fighting for and highly instructive. I visited three continents and met some inspiring people, both patients and doctors, in the course of it.\n\nSometimes writing fiction is very technical, to do with finding the voices, tones and registers that best articulate your themes; I love all that, but there is no doubt that if you have some crusading purpose as well, it does put extra fire in your belly. I suppose for that reason I would also want \u201cBirdsong\u201d to be there or thereabouts when they put me under the ground. My younger readers would all vote for \u201cEngleby.\u201d But it\u2019s my funeral, so I\u2019m going with \u201cHuman Traces.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe most important thing for us is making sure that people are safe, so people who live in the affected street are being advised to stay in their homes until the water is cleared.\n\n\u201cThen we will be helping to clear water out of basements, homes, and local businesses.\u201d\n\n\u201cTwo fire engines from Brixton and West Norwood fire stations are at the scene with two fire rescue units from Lewisham and Battersea fire stations. Fire crews are using special dinghy-style boats to get around the flooded area.\u201d\n\nFans of the BBC\u2019s runaway hit Sherlock (a modernization of author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\u2019s Sherlock Holmes franchise) have been eagerly anticipating a third season since the cliff-hanger ending to the season two finale, \u201cThe Reichenbach Fall\u201d. Co-creator Steven Moffat dosed that fire with more fuel a few months ago, when he announced a three-word tease hinting at which stories from Doyle\u2019s source material are going to serve as the basis for each of the season\u2019s three 90-minute episodes.\n\nSherlock Season 3?s planned premiere date changed from \u2018When We\u2019re Ready\u2019 to Fall 2013, after Moffat dropped that juicy tidbit. Unfortunately, the latest reports indicate that date has been moved back due to scheduling issues \u2013 namely, those resulting from the newfound popularity of the show\u2019s stars, Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman.\n\nNow, any Sherlock fan worth their salt knows that the show/mini-series\u2019 principal players (Moffat, Cumberbatch, Freeman) are very busy men. Moffat is currently serving as the showrunner for Doctor Who, which Sherlock co-creator Mark Gatiss writes for (in addition to making occasional onscreen appearance). Not to mention, it wasn\u2019t that long ago that Cumberbatch wrapped his still-mysterious villain role in Star Trek: Into Darkness and shot a supporting role in Steven McQueen\u2019s true-story slavery drama Twelve Years A Slave; similarly, Freeman finished the first chunk of principal photography on Peter Jackson\u2019s Hobbit trilogy this summer.\n\nEW says the production start date for Sherlock season 3 has been postponed until March 2013, meaning the show won\u2019t be hitting the BBC until late 2013 (with PBS airing the series in early 2014). No specific schedule conflict is cited in that report, but \u2013 in appropriate Sherlock-ian stye \u2013 it\u2019s easy to deduce what other projects could be responsible for the delay.\n\nIn a Yash Chopra world; everything is punctuated by love, reality is in a distortion field and everybody lives in grand castles; or something similar. We all know that truth can be rather different, but there is no harm in a dream. The movie name was ironic; as it turned out to be his last outing. Despite a few critics; \u2018Jab Tak Hai Jaan\u2019 is a fitting end to the Yash Chopra saga.\n\nMeet Samar Anand(Shah Rukh Khan); a character straight from Mr. Chopra\u2019s storybook; a musician and waiter who is in love with a rich heiress, Meera Thapar(Katrina Kaif). Now, Samar possesses the capacity to charm anybody and everybody; and has a heart of gold. If we could more people like this in real life, I would indeed be very happy. Samar promises to teach Thapar a Punjabi song, and wants to learn the Queen\u2019s English in return.\n\nHindi film stereotypes abound in the conversations with God; Jesus here to be precise. A freestyle dance sequence was one of the best parts of this movie, in my opinion. Made at a budget of a paltry fifty crores; a little less by contemporary Bollywood standards, the movie has blockbuster locations such as Canary Wharf, Ladakh and the great English outdoors. The pacing is a little stilted at times; and the music from Rehman is not as great as expected from him. Gulzar should learn a trick or two from Javed Akhtar to make the lyrics a little palatable for current audiences.\n\nIn the beginning, or the middle. Samar suffers a knock on his head and we learn that this is the reason why we met the intense brooding Major in Ladakh, who likes to sing Rabbi Shergill songs for stress relief. The Discovery channel photo-journalist Akira(Anoushka Sharma) has been treated to the inner life of Samar Anand courtesy his personal diaries. As her future hinges on the documentary being produced on him; she invites him to London again.\n\nTwist here; Shah Rukh again suffers a bump on his head. Some of the screenplay elements defy commonsense, but movies are meant to be make-believe anyways. Before I give the whole story away, people who want to watch it can book a ticket. As a swansong for a great director, Jab Tak Hai Jaan is a mixed bag."
