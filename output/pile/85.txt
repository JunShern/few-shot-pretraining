Property (T) is considered a representation-theoretic form of rigidity, so the Haagerup property may be considered a form of strong nonrigidity; see below for details.\n\nThe Haagerup property is interesting to many fields of mathematics, including harmonic analysis, representation theory, operator K-theory, and geometric group theory.  \n\nPerhaps its most impressive consequence is that groups with the Haagerup Property satisfy the Baum\u2013Connes conjecture and the related Novikov conjecture.  Groups with the Haagerup property are also uniformly embeddable into a Hilbert space.\n\nDefinitions\n\nLet  be a second countable locally compact group.  The following properties are all equivalent, and any of them may be taken to be definitions of the Haagerup property:\n\nThere is a proper continuous conditionally negative definite function .\n has the Haagerup approximation property, also known as Property :  there is a sequence of normalized continuous positive-definite functions  which vanish at infinity on  and converge to 1 uniformly on compact subsets of .\nThere is a strongly continuous unitary representation of  which weakly contains the trivial representation and whose matrix coefficients vanish at infinity on .\nThere is a proper continuous affine isometric action of  on a Hilbert space.\n\nExamples\n\nThere are many examples of groups with the Haagerup property, most of which are geometric in origin.  The list includes:\n\nAll compact groups (trivially).  Note all compact groups also have property (T).  The converse holds as well:  if a group has both property (T) and the Haagerup property, then it is compact.\nSO(n,1)\nSU(n,1)\nGroups acting properly on trees or on -trees\nCoxeter groups\nAmenable groups\nGroups acting properly on CAT(0) cubical complexes\n\nSources \n\nCategory:Representation theory\nCategory:Geometric group theory"
