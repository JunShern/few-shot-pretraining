    "text": "Why is West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee at loggerheads with the Centre?\n\nWhat is this chit fund scam all about?\n\nAnd why did the Trinamool Congress chief go on a dharna for three days?\n\nIf these questions puzzle you, here are some answers, courtesy Dr Sujan Chakraborty, the Left Front legislative party leader in West Bengal who has organised protest rallies by the Chit Fund Sufferers's Unity Forum.\n\n\"The BJP is using the chit fund scam as a political game,\" Dr Chakraborty -- a former Communist Party of India-Marxist MP -- tells Syed Firdaus Ashraf/Rediff.com.\n\nThe TMC blames Bharatiya Janata Party leaders Mukul Roy and Himanta Biswas Sarma while the BJP blames TMC leaders involved in the chit fund scam. Can you give us a clear picture as to what is happening?\n\nThis is not a tussle between the Centre and state as it is being portrayed. This issue is of complete corruption and lakhs of people who have been looted and cheated in the country because of the chit fund scam.\n\nThe leadership and the administration of the ruling party in the state are identified and known in the chit scam.\n\nAlong with them other leaders from different parties too are involved like BJP leader Himanta Biswas Sarma from Assam and some people from Orissa. But the difference is that all the other states agreed to the CBI probe except West Bengal. They opposed the CBI investigation.\n\nOne wonders why the CBI did not take any action for the last five years in the chit fund scam and woke up all of a sudden.\n\nThe CBI has knowledge of many things and has arrested many people. When they started making arrests, Mamata Banerjee opposed it in different ways.\n\nFor example, when her cabinet minister Madan Mitra was arrested, they (the TMC) took out a rally (in his support). In this case concerning Police Commissioner Rajeev Kumar, she sat on a dharna.\n\nIn your opinion, why did Mamata sit on a dharna?\n\nAll documents regarding the chit fund scam have been hushed up by Rajeev Kumar. He knows many details and he even knows of the criminality and corruption of the supreme leaders of the TMC. Therefore, she is apprehensive of Rajeev Kumar's arrest.\n\nWhen those who suffered in the chit fund scam were in trouble, she said what is done is done to them.\n\nMamata did not stand up for those who suffered owing to the chit fund scam, but only stood up for Police Commissioner Rajeev Kumar because he has all the knowledge about the chit fund case.\n\nAnd to answer your earlier question of why is the CBI taking action after four years. It is because the BJP wants to use this case for political advantage. They are not sincere or serious (to recover the money of the chit fund investors).\n\nMukul Roy, who was with Mamata, has now gone to the BJP and is now being protected by them. Similarly, Bharati Ghosh, the ex-cop, has now joined the BJP for protection.\n\nThe BJP is using the chit fund scam as a political game.\n\nWhat role has Rajeev Kumar played in this chit fund scam due to which Mamata has come out in his support?\n\nHe was the heading the SIT (Special Investigation Team) probing the chit fund scam. He was supposed to investigate it in April 2013. The CBI inquiry was ordered in May 2014.\n\nHe had a year to probe; he was instrumental in destroying or tampering evidence etc. That is why he is so important.\n\nWhen the CBI targeted then Gujarat chief minister Modi, he used it as a political opportunity, saying the CBI under the central government is hurting Gujarat's asmita (pride). Is Mamata not doing the same?\n\nBengal people understand Mamata's politics. They are not fools.\n\nThe BJP is trying to portray that it is fighting against corruption, but that is not a true picture.\n\nWhat has happened to the investors? Where are they? And what do they say?\n\nIn West Bengal, it is complete autocracy. The media is not allowed to speak. The investors (those who lost money in the chit scam) are having programmes in every district of West Bengal and demanding payback of their invested money.\n\nThey are organised and have gone to court to recover their money, but they are poor people. They cannot come out for protests every time. Many of them are poor people and they have to earn a livelihood.\n\nDo these poor people who have invested money in the chit funds expect their money back?\n\nSome people feel the money is lost forever. The chief minister has not done anything for the last four, five years.\n\nShe is opposing the CBI inquiry and is also indifferent (to the investors's lost money).\n\nThe Trinamool Congress and the administration are running a police raj in Bengal.\n\nEven if you go to lodge a police complaint, it will not be lodged.\n\nPermissions for political meetings are not given.\n\nWhen the prime minister of India comes to Bengal, whether a helipad will be allowed for him or not is being questioned.\n\nSuch is the state of affairs. These things never happened in Bengal. The political space to oppose is getting lost."
