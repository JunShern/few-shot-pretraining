However, you're lucky since someone has already done the hard work for you.\nThere's a Xamarin.Android control called BottomNavigationBar which has been ported to Xamarin.Forms in the project BottomNavigationBarXF. You'll also find an example of how to get started on the latter repository. On iOS, the control defaults to the standard page with tabs on the bottom.\n\n"
