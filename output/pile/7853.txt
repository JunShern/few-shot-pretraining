London\u2019s skies have been flapping like crazy in the days around Christmas and New Year. As we previously reported, ghosts and out-of-place animals have dominated the strange news stories in recent years, but right now, it's unearthly airborne objects that are causing a stir.\n\nOn 23 December, a video was posted on YouTube by a group called UFO Watch UK. The footage is called Group of White Orb UFO's Over West London and the filmmaker, Mark Bennis, describes himself as a \u201ca UFO watcher and researcher, and an avid enthusiast to this fascinating phenomenon\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s a strange video and we weren't sure what we were watching \u2014 perhaps distant birds or drones buzzing around. There is clearly a flight path in the area, and maybe some photographers were taking close-up shots of landing planes, with their drones. We showed the video to Sheffield Hallam University's Dr David Clarke, author of The UFO Files: The Inside Story of Real-life Sightings, who also thought these were drones \u2014 pointing out that one had got within 20ft of a plane at Heathrow in July 2014.\n\nMark Pilkington, writer of the book and film Mirage Men, was more cautious: \u201cThey could be balloons, or perhaps drones of some kind. For the time being anyway, I'll have to agree that these are genuine UFOs \u2014 Unidentified Flying Objects.\u201d This does not necessarily mean spaceships or inter-dimensional orbs \u2014 just something unidentifiable in the sky.\n\nMeanwhile in Bexleyheath on 30 December, contractor Tony Histed was leaving his work site beneath gathering clouds. He looked up and saw \u201ca bright light in the sky to the east\u201d so he \u201cstopped and watched it as it came across the sky towards the storm. Another light appeared in front of the first, and they both flew silently on into the oncoming storm.\u201d Tony went back to the site and saw two more of these \u2018orbs\u2019 rise from the ground, level off and fly in a north-easterly direction. He was able to get one photograph which appeared in an 8 January 2015 news report, along with photos of Tony recreating the moment he saw the UFOs. He doesn\u2019t look pleased to see them. Bexleyheath is a veritable UFO hotspot, having previously experienced close encounters of the first kind in 1952, 1955 and 2004.\n\nThe first UFO sighting of 2015 took place while the New Year fireworks were still exploding about the London Eye. One viewer not too distracted by trying to remember the second verse of Auld Lang Syne saw a circular light arcing around the wheel amongst the pyrotechnics. One YouTube comment advised that \u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon for UFOs to be curious about our lights and electricity.\u201d The UFO also got a very fine live view of the New Year fireworks without paying the Mayor of London's office a penny.\n\nThe final part of the video below has a green object descend into the top right hand corner of the screen and gaze out as if it were scanning the viewer\u2019s very soul.\n\nThe original footage has been picked up and shared among a number of UFO enthusiasts, and received a warmer and more credulous welcome than the original YouTube post. It looks like it has been filmed from a television screen by someone using a camera and the first UFO is clearly a camera drone filming the fireworks. That's made even more evident when the footage cuts to an aerial shot of the London Eye, almost certainly taken from the drone itself. The green light is a little trickier to work out. Some have suggested it was the drone again, some that it was a decoration on the South Bank caught by an in situ camera. Others, noting that this is a screen being filmed, insist that someone has plopped an LED light or decoration between the camera and screen; hence the object's jerky motion.\n\nThe day after, another UFO was spotted on some BBC footage. According to the poster\u2019s Twitter feed this was an interview with someone from Clapham Rovers, during which time a UFO coasted into view from the right-hand side of the screen.\n\nWe can\u2019t actually make anything out on the video except for sunlight breaking through the clouds and as there is no sound, and the video jumps from scene to scene, it's hard to work out whether the video is linear or arranged in a way to make sunbeams look extra-terrestrial. Which they are, of course, but not in the way we\u2019re talking about here.\n\nJust to prove our point, seminal 1990s UFO show The X-Files is hovering back in to view and, just this very morning, Camilla Noble, of Caroline Road, Wimbledon shared her footage of \u2018flashing spaceships\u2019 filmed from her bedroom window with the Wimbledon Guardian. Camilla has been seeing UFOs regularly down in SE19: \"Sometimes they will appear as fire-flies dots and sometimes as really really bright stars\u201d she says, \u201cthen they stop and pretend to be a star and then they go in another direction and turn back into UFOs with flashing lights.\"\n\nLondon, of course, is full of wonders, and we shall continue to bring them to you from above, below, and all the stuff in-between."
