Technical Field\nExemplary embodiment(s) of the present disclosure relate to the sport of fishing and, more particularly, to a line reeling apparatus for providing users with an easy and convenient means of assisting the relining of a reel with a damaged line of a fishing pole.\n2. Prior Art\nOne of the most beloved and well known sports enjoyed by Americans is fishing. In fact, the estimated number of U.S. recreational anglers is well over 50 million, with more participants than golfing and tennis combined. An enduring American tradition, fishing is enjoyed by people of all ages and from all walks of life. Recent data released by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service reveals that the sports fishing brings $116 billion worth of benefits to the local, state and national economies. Because sport fishing is extremely enjoyable, many participants find it suitable to fish whenever the time permits and the opportunity presents itself. Every child, boy or girl, remembers the first time their father or grandfather took them fishing.\nIn addition to reveling in the quality time spent in the beautiful outdoors with a respected adult, kids are very excited to try to lure an unsuspecting fish with their pole and bait. Nothing quite equates the sense of accomplishment felt by a child when he successfully catches a fish. The sudden jerks that signify a nibble on a line, the tense downward pull that ensures a hook has found its mark, and the frenzied reel-in of the line to find the prize swaying from the other end, all combine to foster feelings of glee and wonder for children who fish. With all the positive benefits of exposing youngsters to this thrilling sport, the first few attempts at teaching children the art are fishing can be a bit challenging.\nParticularly, properly lining a reel onto a pole can be a bit daunting to young anglers. Trying to manipulate the thin material of the line and carefully wind it over the reel can be a frustrating endeavor, especially if the line jumps or becomes twisted and thus one must start the entire process over from the beginning. In addition, adults who experience hand ailments such as arthritis may find it painful, or even impossible, to manually reline. Often requiring the fisherman to seek assistance from a friend, relining a fishing pole can be a challenging endeavor that takes away much of the fun associated with this exciting sport.\nAccordingly, a need remains for a reeling apparatus in order to overcome prior art shortcomings. The exemplary embodiment(s) satisfy such a need by providing an apparatus that is convenient and easy to use, lightweight yet durable in design, versatile in its applications, and designed for assisting the relining of a reel with a damaged line of a fishing pole."
