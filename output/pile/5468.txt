    "text": "Q:\n\nGeneralization of L\u00e9vy's continuity theorem for nuclear spaces\n\nI am interested in a generalization of the following finite-dimensional results in infinite dimensional vector-space with nuclear structure, especially for the cases of the spaces of distributions $\\mathcal{D}'(\\mathrm{R}^N)$ and $\\mathcal{S}'(\\mathrm{R}^N)$.\nTheorem 1: \nLet $X_n$, $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$ and $X$ be random variables in $\\mathbb{R}^N$ and $\\Phi_n$ and $\\Phi$ their characteristic functions. Then,\n$$\\left( X_n \\overset{\\mathcal{L}}{\\rightarrow} X  \\right) \\Leftrightarrow \\left( \\forall \\omega, \\Phi_n(\\omega) \\rightarrow \\Phi(\\omega) \\right).$$\nTheorem 2: (L\u00e9vy's continuity theorem)\nAgain, the $X_n$'s are random variable and the $\\Phi_n$'s are their characteristic functions. Assume that the limit $\\lim \\Phi_n(\\omega)$ exists pointwise and is denoted by $\\Phi(\\omega)$. We then have the equivalence:\n\n$(X_n)$ converges in law to some random variable $X$.\n$\\Phi$ is continuous at $0$.\n\nNow I precise my question. Given a probability measure $\\mu$ on $\\mathcal{N}' = \\mathcal{D}'(\\mathrm{R}^N)$ or $\\mathcal{S}'(\\mathrm{R}^N)$, we can define its characteristic functional on $\\mathcal{N}$ by \n$$\\hat{\\mu}(\\varphi) = \\int_{\\mathcal{N}'} \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{j} \\langle u , \\varphi \\rangle} \\mathrm{d}\\mu (u).$$\nThis generalizes the concept characteristic function of a random variable (Bochner's theorem being generalized by Minlos's theorem). Is the following result true? \nPossible generalization of theorem 1:\nLet $\\mu_n$, $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$ and $\\mu$ be probability measures on $\\mathcal{N}'$ and $\\hat{\\mu}_n$ and $\\mu$ their characteristic functionals. Then,\n$$\\left( \\mu_n \\overset{\\mathrm{weakly}}{\\rightarrow} \\mu  \\right) \\Leftrightarrow \\left( \\forall \\varphi, \\hat{\\mu}_n(\\varphi) \\rightarrow \\mu(\\varphi) \\right).$$\nSimilarly, can we generalize the L\u00e9vy's continuity theorem?\nThanks for attention.\n\nA:\n\nThere is a partial result due to Boulicaut (1973), which states \n\nTheorem:  Let $E$ be a separable metrizable Hausdorff locally convex topological vector space. Then $E$ is nuclear if and only if for every sequence $\\{\\mu_n\\}$ of tight probability measures, weak convergence to a tight probability measure $\\mu$ is equivalent to the pointwise convergence of the characteristic functions of $\\mu_n$ to the ch. f. of $\\mu$. \n\nThis makes characteristic function(al)s more useful than in separable Banach spaces, where they are only used for uniqueness but not weak convergence.\n\n"
