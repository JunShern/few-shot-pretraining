What should I know about software management to better my chances of becoming a manager? How can I get 'real-world' experience at this stage that's as valuable as possible?\n\nA:\n\nMy honest advice is that there is so much time and \"cognitive distance\" between high school and a professional career in management, that I would say \"take classes you love and will do well in\"  Go to college/university and discover your passion and career interests there.  If you are successful and want to move into management, then you have many options.\nThere are just too many \"good paths\" into management:  I've seen English Majors, Art Majors, History Majors, Biology Majors, CS Majors, EE Majors, and I'm a Physics Major myself.  \nIf you want to focus on software, then do something that keeps you coding and developing.  having domain experience is a huge help for any management position.\nDon't be afraid to change directions and try new things.  If you really love Project Management, there will always be opportunities...\ngood luck and enjoy the trip!  \n\nA:\n\nFind some projects to manage. The principles of project management apply across all different types of activities.  You could help work on a website, blog or coordinate a group event. \nI would focus on doing something that entails gathering requirements from somebody, working with another person or group of people to produce the deliverable that meets those requirements then deliver the project.\n\n"
