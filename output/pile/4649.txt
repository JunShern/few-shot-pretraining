    "text": "PS3 Attitude\u2019s Most Wanted Games of 2010 #7 \u2013 Batman: Arkham Asylum 2\n\nWhen the votes were cast for this year\u2019s Most Wanted Games of 2010, there were a few titles that were tossed around that many of us probably wouldn\u2019t have even dreamed mentioning a few months ago.\n\nDuring this long and arduous process, over thirty games garnered nominations, but when the dust settled and the arguing stopped, no other game received more knowing nods among the staff here at PS3 Attitude for making a surprise appearance on this list than Batman: Arkham Asylum 2 (though it\u2019s unlikely to retain such a title).\n\nIt\u2019s a testament to the quality of the first game that word of a sequel got our red phones ringing and rushing to encase ourselves in a cape and leather. From its excellent balance of stealth and action to the fitting use of gadgets and techniques Batman implements to overcome the inhabitants of Gotham\u2019s renown loony-bin, B:AA not only hit a lot of our buttons, it punched them right off our faces.\n\nNaturally, considering the game was only announced a couple of weeks ago at the VGAs, little is actually known about Rocksteady\u2019s second caped-crusade with the Dark Knight. In a way, with such little information to currently go on, it only compounds what a great job the guys at Rocksteady did the first time to make us want something we know so practically nothing about.\n\n\"Bit to the left, left ... left ... there, you got it ...\"\n\nWhat we do know is that Arkham is unlikely to be the setting of the sequel, or at least the only setting. With Rocksteady\u2019s Paul Denning confirming that a sand-box Batman title just wouldn\u2019t work, it\u2019s probable that other Gotham landmarks will also make an appearance. Such locales could include the likes of Wayne Manor to the shadowy alleyways that claimed the lives of Bruce\u2019s parents, what we can expect is that, with the success of the first game surely rewarding the Rocksteady crew a bigger budget, things are going to get bigger and, excuse the pun, even batter.\n\nOther than the game\u2019s possible locations, the only other thing we have to go on is what was shown at the VGAs. Depicting a sickly \u2013 though just as insane as ever \u2013 Joker, the Batman 2 teaser at least confirms that Bat\u2019s arch-nemesis is returning. What other villains will make the role-call is anybody\u2019s guess, but no matter who turns up, we\u2019re looking forward to unleashing our brains and our brawn in another stellar action title next year.\n\nHere\u2019s the obligatory quote from the team:\n\nThe original Arkham Asylum is one of the best games of 2009 and is definitely the best superhero game ever created. With the foundation already made, there is no doubt that the sequel will be even better \u2013 PS3 Attitude\u2019s Delriach\n\nBatman 2 \u2013 or whatever it is ultimately called- hits sometime late next year."
