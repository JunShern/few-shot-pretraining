Madden (\u201cMadden\u201d) appeals the order of the Jefferson Superior Court\n\n      denying his motion to correct error which claimed that the trial court had\n\n      improperly delegated to the Community Corrections program the authority to\n\n      decide whether Madden should be subject to electronic monitoring.\n\n\n[2]   We affirm.\n\n      Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 39A01-1404-CR-173 | February 4, 2015               Page 1 of 18\n\f                             Facts and Procedural History\n[3]   On June 28, 2011, pursuant to a plea agreement, Madden pled guilty to one\n\n      count of Class D felony receiving stolen property in Cause No. 39D01-1006-FB-\n\n      487 (\u201cCause No. 487\u201d). The trial court accepted the plea agreement and\n\n      imposed a three-year suspended sentence. Nine months later, on March 13,\n\n      2012, the State charged Madden with one count of Class A misdemeanor check\n\n      deception in Cause No. 39D01-1203-CM-305 (\u201cCause No. 305\u201d).\n\n\n[4]   On June 7, 2012\u2014at which time Madden was on probation in Cause No. 487,\n\n      and his charges under Cause No. 305 were pending\u2014security cameras recorded\n\n      him stealing several cartons of cigarettes from a gas station in Hanover,\n\n      Indiana. The next day, when police officers attempted to arrest Madden, he fled\n\n      on foot and, after a brief chase, had to be subdued with a taser. After Madden\n\n      was apprehended, the police discovered methamphetamine and methadone in\n\n      his possession. Accordingly, on June 11, 2012, the State charged Madden in\n\n      Cause No. 39D01-1206-FB-721 (\u201cCause No. 721\u201d) as follows: Count I, Class B\n\n      felony possession of methamphetamine; Count II, Class C felony possession of\n\n      a controlled substance; Count III, Class D felony theft; Count IV, Class A\n\n      misdemeanor resisting law enforcement; and Count V, Class A misdemeanor\n\n      possession of paraphernalia. In addition, the State filed a petition to revoke\n\n      Madden\u2019s probation in Cause No. 487.\n\n\n[5]   On March 6, 2013, Madden entered into a plea agreement with the State\n\n      whereby he pleaded guilty to the reduced charge of Class D felony possession of\n\n\n      Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 39A01-1404-CR-173 | February 4, 2015   Page 2 of 18\n\f      methamphetamine in Cause No. 721, Class A misdemeanor check deception in\n\n      Cause No. 305, and admitted that he violated his probation in Cause No. 487.\n\n      The trial court accepted the plea agreement and, per its terms, sentenced\n\n      Madden to three years for possession of methamphetamine, one year for check\n\n      deception, and reinstated his three-year suspended sentence for the probation\n\n      violation\u2014all to be fully executed and served consecutively. In accordance with\n\n      the plea agreement, the trial court also referred Madden to the \u201cPurposeful\n\n      Incarceration\u201d program, with the recommendation that he be placed in the\n\n      Therapeutic Community Program (\u201cTCP\u201d) at Branchville Correctional Facility.\n\n      The Department of Correction (\u201cDOC\u201d) subsequently assigned Madden to\n\n      Branchville, and on April 22, 2013, he enrolled in the TCP.\n\n\n[6]   Another provision of the plea agreement stipulated that upon his successful\n\n      completion of the TCP, Madden could petition the trial court for a sentence\n\n      modification. On December 18, 2013, Madden filed a petition to modify his\n\n      sentence based on his completion of the TCP program. The trial court held a\n\n      hearing on Madden\u2019s sentence modification petition on February 19, 2014, and\n\n      issued an order that same day granting the petition. In its sentence modification\n\n      order, the trial court found that the sentences under Cause No. 487 and Cause\n\n      No. 305 had been fully served. The court then suspended the remaining\n\n      sentence under Cause No. 721 to supervised probation. The trial court also\n\n      ordered Madden:\n\n              to report to the Jefferson County Community Corrections Department\n              as a specific term of probation with determination of appropriate\n              program to be made by the Community Corrections Department, and\n\n      Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 39A01-1404-CR-173 | February 4, 2015   Page 3 of 18\n\f        shall include all other terms of probation as outlined in the Terms of\n        Supervised Probation With Community Corrections Placement prepared by\n        the Court, read to the defendant at this hearing, and filed in this\n        matter.\n\n\nAppellant\u2019s App. p. 98. In relevant part, the Terms of Probation instructed\n\nMadden to:\n\n        14.     comply with all rules for Community Corrections placement,\n        including but not limited to \u201ccomponent rules\u201d, and with any program\n        recommended or required by Community Corrections, including electronic\n        monitoring, day reporting, counseling, and educational programs[.]\n        [I]n the event that [C]ommunity Corrections recommends or requires\n        electronic monitoring, the following conditions and terms apply:\n        15. . . . be confined to home at all times except when the defendant is\n              a.   working at employment approved by the Court or traveling to\n                   or from said employment,\n              b.   unemployed and seeking employment approved by the Court,\n              c.   undergoing counseling, medical, mental health, psychiatric\n                   treatment, or other treatment approved by the Court,\n              d.   attending an educational institution or facility or other\n                   program approved by the Court,\n              e.   attending a regularly scheduled religious service at a bona fide\n                   place of worship,\n              f.   participating in a community work release or community\n                   service program approved by the Court, or\n              g.   engaged in another activity approved in advance by the Court\n                   or Community Corrections[.]\n\n\nAppellant\u2019s App. p. 94 (emphasis added). The Terms of Probation further notified\n\nMadden that a violation of the electronic monitoring rules could result in a criminal\n\ncharge for escape; that he was obligated to abide by a schedule prepared by\n\n\nCourt of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 39A01-1404-CR-173 | February 4, 2015        Page 4 of 18\n\f      Community Corrections and to communicate any changes in that schedule with\n\n      Community Corrections; that he must maintain a working land-line telephone at his\n\n      house; and that he would be responsible for payment of all applicable electronic\n\n      monitoring fees. At the modification hearing, Madden acknowledged that he\n\n      understood and agreed to comply with the Terms of Probation.\n\n[7]   On March 19, 2014, Madden filed a motion to correct error. He alleged that\n\n      the trial court improperly delegated its authority by allowing Community\n\n      Corrections to decide whether\u2014and for what duration\u2014he should be placed on\n\n      electronic monitoring as a condition of his probation.1 On March 21, 2014, the\n\n      trial court denied his motion without a hearing. Madden now appeals.\n\n\n\n                                       Standard of Review\n[8]   Madden claims that the trial court erred in setting the conditions of his\n\n      probation. We first note that he is appealing from the trial court\u2019s denial of his\n\n      motion to correct error. On review, our court will uphold a trial court\u2019s ruling\n\n      on a motion to correct error absent an abuse of discretion. Nichols v. State, 947\n\n      N.E.2d 1011, 1015 (Ind. Ct. App. 2011), reh\u2019g denied. The trial court abuses its\n\n      discretion when its decision is clearly against the logic and effect of the facts\n\n      and circumstances, or when the trial court misinterprets the law. Heaton v. State,\n\n      984 N.E.2d 614, 616 (Ind. 2013). To the extent that Madden has presented any\n\n\n\n\n      1\n      The record does not indicate whether Community Corrections did, in fact, subject Madden to electronic\n      monitoring.\n\n      Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 39A01-1404-CR-173 | February 4, 2015                   Page 5 of 18\n\f       issues that involve questions of law, our review is de novo. Nichols, 947 N.E.2d\n\n       at 1015.\n\n[9]    We also note that trial courts are vested with broad discretion in establishing\n\n       the terms of probation, which are subject to review only for an abuse of\n\n       discretion. Berry v. State, 10 N.E.3d 1243, 1247 (Ind. 2014). Probation\n\n       conditions \u201cmust be reasonably related to the treatment of the defendant and\n\n       the protection of public safety.\u201d Hurd v. State, 9 N.E.3d 720, 726 (Ind. Ct. App.\n\n       2014). Accordingly, our task on review is to consider whether the conditions\n\n       imposed on the defendant \u201care reasonably related to attaining these goals.\u201d Id.\n\n       Although probation and community corrections programs are not precisely the\n\n       same, they are treated the same for many purposes. McQueen v. State, 862\n\n       N.E.2d 1237, 1243 (Ind. Ct. App. 2007). Both probation and community\n\n       corrections serve as alternatives to commitment to the DOC; they both are\n\n       made at the sole discretion of the trial court; a defendant is not entitled to serve\n\n       a sentence in either, and placement is a \u201cmatter of grace\u201d and a \u201cfavor, not a\n\n       right\u201d; and the due process rights for revocation of community corrections\n\n       placement and probation hearings are the same. Id.\n\n\n\n                                   Discussion and Decision\n[10]   Madden claims that the trial court erred by delegating to Community\n\n       Corrections the authority to determine if, and for how long, he should be placed\n\n       on home detention. Home detention, he claims, is a \u201cmaterially punitive\u201d\n\n       condition of probation that must be determined by the trial court, not\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 39A01-1404-CR-173 | February 4, 2015   Page 6 of 18\n\f       Community Corrections. Madden notes that Indiana Code section 35-38-2-\n\n       1(a)(1) provides that the trial court \u201cshall . . . specify in the record the\n\n       conditions of the probation.\u201d He also observes that, as a condition of\n\n       probation, \u201cthe court may require a person to . . . undergo home detention under\n\n       IC 35-38-2.5.\u201d Ind. Code \u00a7 35-38-2-2.3(a)(16) (emphasis added). Madden reads\n\n       these provisions to mean that only the trial court may determine if and for how\n\n       long he should be subject to home detention. We do not agree.\n\n\n[11]   Although trial courts are indeed required by statute to set forth the terms of\n\n       probation, they also have authority to allow Community Corrections programs\n\n       to supervise various aspects of probation. For example, a trial court may order a\n\n       probationer to home detention supervised by a Community Corrections\n\n       program. Ind. Code \u00a7 35-38-2.5-5(c). A trial court may also order a probationer\n\n       subject to such home detention to abide by a schedule prepared by the\n\n       Community Corrections program. Ind. Code \u00a7 35-38-2.5-6(3). More\n\n       importantly, when supervising a probationer on home detention, Community\n\n       Corrections programs are specifically required by statute to \u201cset the monitoring\n\n       device[2] and surveillance equipment to minimize the possibility that the\n\n\n\n\n       2\n           A \u201cmonitoring device\u201d is defined as \u201can electronic device that:\n\n                   (1) can record or transmit information twenty-four (24) hours each day regarding an\n                   offender\u2019s:\n\n                       (A) presence or absence from the offender\u2019s home; or\n                       (B) precise location;\n                   (2) is minimally intrusive upon the privacy of the offender or other persons residing in\n                   the offender\u2019s home\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 39A01-1404-CR-173 | February 4, 2015                             Page 7 of 18\n\f       offender or alleged offender can enter another residence or structure without a\n\n       violation.\u201d Ind. Code \u00a7 35-38-2.5-10(d).\n\n[12]   Here, the trial court ordered, as a condition of probation, that Madden be\n\n       subject to home detention as supervised by the Community Corrections\n\n       program, which is authorized by the home detention statutes. Also, the\n\n       Community Corrections program is required by statute to place such a\n\n       probationer on electronic monitoring. Given this statutory authority, we cannot\n\n       say that the portion of the trial court\u2019s order requiring Madden to comply with\n\n       all rules established by the Community Corrections program, including\n\n       electronic monitoring, improperly delegates the trial court\u2019s sentencing\n\n       authority to the Community Corrections program.\n\n\n[13]   We find the cases cited by Madden in support of his claim to be distinguishable.\n\n       For example, Madden cites Freije v. State, 709 N.E.2d 323 (Ind. 1999), to\n\n\n\n                (3) with the written consent of the offender and with the written consent of other persons\n                residing in the home at the time an order for home detention is entered, may record or\n                transmit:\n                    (A) a visual image;\n                    (B) an electronic communication or any sound; or\n\n                    (C) information regarding the offender\u2019s activities while inside the offender\u2019s home;\n                    and\n                (4) can notify a probation department, a community corrections program, or a contract\n                agency if the offender violates the terms of a home detention order.\n\n                (b) The term includes any device that can reliably determine the location of an offender\n                and track the locations where the offender has been, including a device that uses a global\n                positioning system satellite service.\n\n                (c) The term does not include an unmanned aerial vehicle (as defined in IC 35-31.5-2-\n                342.3).\n       Ind. Code \u00a7 35-38-2.5-3(a).\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 39A01-1404-CR-173 | February 4, 2015                        Page 8 of 18\n\f       support his claim that the trial court cannot delegate authority to impose\n\n       materially punitive obligations to Community Corrections. However, Freije\n\n       does not hold that the trial court may not \u201cdelegate\u201d authority to Community\n\n       Corrections. Instead, it holds that a trial court may not unilaterally impose\n\n       conditions of probation that materially add to the punitive obligation, such as\n\n       home detention and community service, after the court has already accepted a\n\n       plea agreement which did not contain such conditions. Id. at 325-26. See also\n\n       Jackson v. State, 968 N.E.2d 328, 332 (Ind. Ct. App. 2012) (following Freije and\n\n       holding that the trial court was without authority to order defendant to perform\n\n       community service when such was not provided for in plea agreement); see also\n\n       Disney v. State, 441 N.E.2d 489, 493 (Ind. Ct. App. 1982) (holding that trial\n\n       court erred in ordering restitution as a condition of probation where such was\n\n       not included in the plea agreement). Here, however, Madden does not claim\n\n       that the trial court\u2019s modification of his sentence is contrary to his plea\n\n       agreement.3 In fact, the plea agreement specifically authorizes the trial court to\n\n       modify Madden\u2019s sentence, and the plea agreement places no limitations on the\n\n       trial court\u2019s discretion in so modifying the sentence. See Appellant\u2019s App. p .61.\n\n\n[14]   Similarly, McGuire v. State, 625 N.E.2d 1281 (Ind. Ct. App. 1993), provides little\n\n       support for Madden\u2019s position. That case held that a trial court erred in\n\n       ordering restitution in an amount to be determined by the probation\n\n\n       3\n        The dissent contends that, even if the trial court had authority to \u201cdelegate\u201d to Community Corrections the\n       authority to determine the conditions of Madden\u2019s electronic monitoring, such a condition would violate the\n       terms of his plea agreement. We disagree, and as noted above, Madden does not directly claim that the trial\n       court\u2019s modification order violated the plea agreement.\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 39A01-1404-CR-173 | February 4, 2015                      Page 9 of 18\n\f       department, not to exceed $250. Id. at 1282. The court noted that the statutory\n\n       authority to order restitution granted such authority to the trial court, not the\n\n       probation department. Id. Here, in contrast, the relevant statutes authorize the\n\n       trial court to impose home detention as a condition of probation and to have a\n\n       Community Corrections program supervise such home detention. Other\n\n       statutes authorize the Community Corrections program to set rules for\n\n       probationers placed in the program and specifically requires Community\n\n       Corrections to set monitoring devices and surveillance equipment to ensure a\n\n       probationer\u2019s compliance.4\n\n[15]   Madden also claims that the trial court\u2019s order deprives him of due process.\n\n       Although not entitled to the full panoply of rights afforded to a criminal\n\n       defendant, a probationer is entitled to certain minimum requirements of\n\n       procedural due process, which include:\n\n                (a) written notice of the claimed violations of probation; (b) disclosure\n                to the probationer of the evidence against him; (c) opportunity to be\n                heard in person and to present witnesses and documentary evidence;\n                (d) the right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses (unless\n                the hearing officer specifically finds good cause for not allowing\n                confrontation); (e) a neutral and detached hearing body; and (f) a\n                written statement by the fact finders as to the evidence relied on and\n                reasons for revoking probation.\n\n       4\n        The other cases cited by Madden are also unavailing. Ratliff v. State, 546 N.E.2d 309, 313 (Ind. Ct. App.\n       1989), simply holds that \u201ca defendant\u2019s probation cannot be revoked for the violation of conditions not\n       specified, either orally or in writing, at the time of sentencing.\u201d Here, however, the terms of Madden\u2019s\n       probation, including any electronic monitoring, are set forth in the written terms of his probation. Nor has\n       Madden yet been accused of violating any of the conditions of his probation; he is simply challenging the\n       terms of his probation. Also, United States v. Bonanno, 146 F.3d 502, 511 (7th Cir. 1998), held that the trial\n       court exceeded its authority and gave to the probation office too much discretion to manage drug tests of the\n       defendant. However, not only is Bonanno not binding on this court, the statutes at issue here do authorize the\n       actions of the trial court.\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 39A01-1404-CR-173 | February 4, 2015                       Page 10 of 18\n\f       Pope v. State, 853 N.E.2d 970, 972-73 (Ind. Ct. App. 2006) (citing Morrissey v.\n\n       Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 489 (1972)). In arguing that he was denied due process,\n\n       Madden first simply reiterates his claims regarding the trial court\u2019s allegedly\n\n       improper \u201cdelegation.\u201d Madden then argues:\n\n               By delegating that authority to Community Corrections the Trial\n               Court eliminates the probationers right to a hearing, where [the\n               defendant] should be represented by counsel, be provided the\n               opportunity to present evidence, and have the opportunity to contest\n               Community Corrections decision to impinge on their \u201cconditional\n               liberty interest\u201d.\n       Appellant\u2019s Br. p. 11. To the extent that Madden\u2019s argument refers to the trial\n\n       court\u2019s sentence modification order, we would note that Madden was in fact\n\n       provided with a hearing, at which he was represented by counsel and presented\n\n       evidence to support his sentence modification. Accordingly, we cannot see any\n\n       violation of procedural due process in this regard.\n\n[16]   If Madden is instead referring to any future finding by the Community\n\n       Corrections program that he violated his probation, this question is not yet ripe\n\n       for review as Madden has not yet been found to be in violation of any terms of\n\n       his probation. Moreover, we find nothing in Madden\u2019s Terms of Probation that\n\n       would indicate that the trial court intended to allow the Community\n\n       Corrections program unilaterally to determine whether Madden had violated\n\n       the terms of his probation.5\n\n\n\n       5\n        Further, as we noted in Pope, even if we were to conclude that \u201cCommunity Corrections [is] the proper\n       decision-making authority,\u201d a doubtful proposition, then Community Corrections would be \u201crequired to give\n       [the probationer] notice and a hearing.\u201d 853 N.E.2d at 973.\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 39A01-1404-CR-173 | February 4, 2015                  Page 11 of 18\n\f                                                Conclusion\n[17]   The trial court\u2019s order modifying Madden\u2019s sentence and imposing conditions\n\n       of probation did not improperly delegate the trial court\u2019s authority to\n\n       Community Corrections, nor did the trial court\u2019s order deprive Madden of\n\n       procedural due process.\n\n\n[18]   Affirmed.\n\n       Crone, J., concurs.\n       Riley, J., dissents with opinion.\n\n\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 39A01-1404-CR-173 | February 4, 2015   Page 12 of 18\n\f                                                   IN THE\n           COURT OF APPEALS OF INDIANA\n\n       Chad A.

Therefore, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n[20]   Indiana\u2019s probation statute unambiguously states that \u201c[w]henever it places a\n\n       person on probation, the court shall . . . specify in the record the conditions of\n\n       the probation.\u201d Ind. Code \u00a7 35-38-2-1(a)(1) (emphasis added). Specifically,\n\n       \u201cthe court may require a person to do [any] combination\u201d of twenty-three\n\n       statutorily-enumerated conditions, one of which is to \u201c[u]ndergo home\n\n       detention.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 35-38-2-2.3(a)(16) (emphasis added). In addition, the home\n\n       detention statute specifies that \u201cas a condition of probation a court may order an\n\n\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 39A01-1404-CR-173 | February 4, 2015              Page 13 of 18\n\f       offender confined to the offender\u2019s home for a period of home detention lasting\n\n       at least sixty (60) days.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 35-38-2.5-5 (emphasis added).\n\n[21]   Once a court has ordered electronic monitoring as a condition of probation, it\n\n       may assign supervisory duties to a community corrections department. I.C. \u00a7\n\n       35-38-2.5-5(c). See White v. State, 560 N.E.2d 45, 47 (Ind. 1990) (noting that the\n\n       trial court \u201csets the \u2018conditions of probation\u2019 and the probation officer\n\n       supervises and assists the defendant in implementing and carrying out those\n\n       conditions\u201d). The majority assumes that Community Corrections\u2019 supervisory\n\n       role equates to having the authority to require home detention. 6 I disagree.\n\n\n[22]   The probation and home detention statutes explicitly establish that the duty to\n\n       demarcate the conditions of probation resides squarely with the trial court. See\n\n       McGuire v. State, 625 N.E.2d 1281, 1282 (Ind. Ct. App. 1993) (finding the trial\n\n       court improperly delegated authority to the probation department to fix the\n\n       amount and manner of restitution because the probation statute specifically\n\n       directs the trial court to make these determinations). Nowhere in these statutes\n\n       is there language indicating that the trial court may delegate its authority to\n\n       define a defendant\u2019s terms of probation, and \u201cit is just as important to recognize\n\n       what a statute does not say as it is to recognize what it does say.\u201d Million v.\n\n       6\n        The State contends that community corrections programs are statutorily authorized to establish their own\n       rules, and \u201ccommunity corrections inherently includes \u2018electronic monitoring.\u2019\u201d (State\u2019s Br. p. 8). In support\n       of this argument, the State relies on Indiana Code chapter 35-38-2.6, which governs direct placement in a\n       community corrections program. Contrary to a sentence that has been suspended to probation, direct\n       placement is a means of serving the executed portion of a sentence and must be succeeded by a term of\n       probation. I.C. \u00a7 35-38-2.6-7; Brown v. State, 894 N.E.2d 598, 600-01 (Ind. Ct. App. 2008). Home detention\n       may be ordered for either probation or direct placement in community corrections; here, however, the trial\n       court expressly made Madden\u2019s compliance with Community Corrections\u2019 requirements a condition of his\n       probation. Thus, this case is governed by Indiana Code chapter 35-38-2 and chapter 35-38-2.5.\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 39A01-1404-CR-173 | February 4, 2015                      Page 14 of 18\n\f       State, 646 N.E.2d 998, 1002 (Ind. Ct. App. 1995). Contrary to the majority\u2019s\n\n       contention that \u201cthe Community Corrections program is required by statute to\n\n       place such a probationer on electronic monitoring[,]\u201d the home detention\n\n       statute specifies that a \u201ccommunity corrections program charged by a court\n\n       with supervision of offenders and alleged offenders ordered to undergo home\n\n       detention shall, at the beginning of a period of home detention, set the\n\n       monitoring device . . . .\u201d I.C. \u00a7 35-38-2.5-10(d) (emphasis added).\n\n       Accordingly, before Community Corrections may \u201cset the monitoring device,\u201d\n\n       there must be an order for home detention from the trial court. See I.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a7 35-\n\n       38-2.5-5; -6; -10(d).\n\n\n[23]   Moreover, a probationer must receive \u201cprospective notice of the standard of\n\n       conduct required of him or her while on probation.\u201d Million, 646 N.E.2d at\n\n       1000. Pursuant to the probation statute, \u201cthe trial court must provide the\n\n       defendant a written statement containing the terms and conditions of probation\n\n       at the sentencing hearing.\u201d Gil v. State, 988 N.E.2d 1231, 1234 (Ind. Ct. App.\n\n       2013); see I.C. \u00a7 35-38-2-2.3(b)(1). If no written statement is furnished, the\n\n       record must at least reflect \u201cthat the probationer has been orally advised by the\n\n       sentencing court of the conditions of his probation and [that] the defendant\n\n       specifically acknowledges that he understands those conditions.\u201d Seals v. State,\n\n       700 N.E.2d 1189, 1190 (Ind. Ct. App. 1998).\n\n\n[24]   The majority correctly notes that Madden has not been accused of any\n\n       probation violations, but the purpose of requiring a record of the specific terms\n\n       of probation is also to \u201cprohibit the imposition of additional conditions after\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 39A01-1404-CR-173 | February 4, 2015   Page 15 of 18\n\f       sentencing.\u201d Million, 646 N.E.2d at 1000. At the time of sentencing,\n\n       probations are \u201centitled to provisions which establish definite restrictions during\n\n       the probation period.\u201d Dulin v. State, 346 N.E.2d 746, 754 (Ind. Ct. App. 1976),\n\n       reh\u2019g denied. \u201c[T]he language must be such that it describes with clarity and\n\n       particularity the misconduct that will result in penal consequences.\u201d Hunter v.\n\n       State, 883 N.E.2d 1161, 1163 (Ind. 2008).\n\n\n[25]   Here, the Terms of Probation failed to conclusively apprise Madden of his\n\n       obligations because the condition of home detention was tentative, pending an\n\n       assessment by Community Corrections. The Terms of Probation specified the\n\n       rules that would govern Madden\u2019s confinement in the event that Community\n\n       Corrections elected to require electronic monitoring, and Madden agreed to\n\n       comply with these rules when read aloud by the trial court. See I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 35-38-\n\n       2.5-6; -7(a). Thus, there is no dispute that Madden had notice of the restrictions\n\n       to which he might be subjected. However, absent an order from the trial court\n\n       definitively making home detention/electronic monitoring a condition of his\n\n       probation, these parameters are inconsequential. Accordingly, I would find\n\n       that the trial court abused its discretion by authorizing Community Corrections\n\n       to officially decide whether to impose the condition of home detention.\n\n\n[26]   Furthermore, notwithstanding whether the trial court improperly delegated a\n\n       sentencing decision to Community Corrections, I would nevertheless find that\n\n       it was an abuse of discretion to require electronic monitoring as a condition of\n\n       Madden\u2019s probation because the trial court\u2019s initial sentencing decision and\n\n       basis for modification were controlled by the plea agreement. Upon acceptance\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 39A01-1404-CR-173 | February 4, 2015   Page 16 of 18\n\f       of a plea agreement, which is contractual in nature, the trial court is bound by\n\n       its terms \u201cand is precluded from imposing any sentence other than required by\n\n       the plea agreement.\u201d Jackson v. State, 968 N.E.2d 328, 332 (Ind. Ct. App. 2012)\n\n       (quoting Bennett v. State, 802 N.E.2d 919, 921 (Ind. 2004)). Similarly, a\n\n       sentence may only be modified to the extent that it would not violate the plea\n\n       agreement \u201chad it been the sentence originally imposed.\u201d Pannarale v. State, 638\n\n       N.E.2d 1247, 1249 (Ind. 1994).\n\n\n[27]   The plea agreement fixed Madden\u2019s aggregate executed sentence at seven years.\n\n       Other than a provision stipulating that the State and trial court could \u201cconsider\n\n       modification of [Madden] to Jefferson County\u201d upon his completion of the\n\n       Therapeutic Community Program, the plea agreement is entirely silent\n\n       regarding any terms of probation. (Appellant\u2019s App. p. 61). Moreover, no\n\n       language in the plea agreement even confers the trial court with discretion over\n\n       the probationary terms.\n\n\n[28]   It is well established that where the terms of probation are not contemplated by\n\n       the plea agreement, \u201c[t]rial courts are free to impose administrative or\n\n       ministerial conditions as terms of probation.\u201d S.S. v. State, 827 N.E.2d 1168,\n\n       1171 (Ind. Ct. App. 2005), trans. denied. Such conditions may include reporting\n\n       to a probation department, supporting dependents, and maintaining\n\n       employment. Disney v. State, 441 N.E.2d 489, 494 (Ind. Ct. App. 1982). In fact,\n\n       an offender \u201cshould reasonably expect that the county\u2019s standard conditions [of\n\n       probation] may apply.\u201d Freije v. State, 709 N.E.2d 323, 325 (Ind. 1999).\n\n       However, the court is precluded from levying \u201c\u2018substantial obligations of a\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 39A01-1404-CR-173 | February 4, 2015   Page 17 of 18\n\f       punitive nature\u2019 if the plea agreement \u2018is silent to such punitive conditions.\u2019\u201d\n\n       Jackson, 968 N.E.2d at 332 (quoting Bennett, 802 N.E.2d at 921). Home\n\n       detention is undisputedly a condition that \u201cmaterially add[s] to the punitive\n\n       obligation.\u201d Freije, 709 N.E.2d at 325-26. Because the plea agreement did not\n\n       specify that the trial court had the discretion to impose punitive conditions of\n\n       probation, I would find that it lacked the authority to order Madden to be\n\n       placed on home detention. See Berry v. State, 10 N.E.3d 1243, 1249 (Ind. 2014).\n\n       Even Madden\u2019s verbal assent to the Terms of Probation is insufficient to permit\n\n       the trial court to vary the terms of the plea agreement by adding a punitive\n\n       obligation. Jackson, 968 N.E.2d at 332.\n\n\n[29]   Based on the foregoing, I would reverse and remand with instructions for the\n\n       trial court to revise Madden\u2019s Terms of Probation.\n\n\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Opinion 39A01-1404-CR-173 | February 4, 2015   Page 18 of 18\n\f"
