    "text": "19 Signs You\u2019re Intelligent \u2014 Even If It Doesn\u2019t Feel Like It\n\nStupid people tend to overestimate their competence, while smart people tend to sell themselves short. As Shakespeare put it in \u201cAs You Like It\u201d: \u201cThe fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be a fool.\u201d\n\nThat conventional wisdom is backed up by a Cornell University study conducted by David Dunning and Justin Kruger. The phenomenon is now known as the Dunning-Kruger effect.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re not too sure about your own intellect, it actually might be a indication that you\u2019re pretty intelligent \u2014 thoughtful enough to realize your limitations, at least.\n\nHere are some subtle signs that you are considerably smarter than you think.\n\n1. You took music lessons\n\nResearch suggests that music helps kids\u2019 minds develop in a few ways:\n\n\u2022 A 2011 study found that scores on a test of verbal intelligence among 4- to 6-year-olds rose after only a month of music lessons.\n\n\u2022 A 2004 study led by Glenn Schellenberg found that 6-year-olds who took nine months of keyboard or voice lessons had an IQ boost compared with kids who took drama lessons or no classes at all.\n\nMeanwhile, a 2013 study, also led by Schellenberg, suggested that high-achieving kids were the ones most likely to take music lessons. In other words, in the real world, musical training may only enhance cognitive differences that already exist.\n\n2. You\u2019re the oldest\n\nOldest siblings are usually smarter, but it\u2019s not because of genetics, one study found.\n\nNorwegian epidemiologists used military records to examine the birth order, health status, and IQ scores of nearly 250,000 18- and 19-year-old men born between 1967 and 1976. Results showed that the average firstborn had an IQ of 103, compared to 100 for second children and 99 for third children.\n\nThe New York Times reports: \u201cThe new findings, from a landmark study published [in June 2007], showed that eldest children had a slight but significant edge in IQ \u2014 an average of three points over the closest sibling. And it found that the difference was not because of biological factors but the psychological interplay of parents and children.\u201d\n\nFor this and other reasons, firstborns tend to be more successful (but not that much more successful) than their siblings.\n\n3. You\u2019re thin\n\nFor a 2006 study, scientists gave roughly 2,200 adults intelligence tests over a five-year period and results suggested that the bigger the waistline, the lower the cognitive ability.\n\nAnother study published that same year found that 11-year-olds who scored lower on verbal and nonverbal tests were more likely to be obese in their 40s. The study authors say that smarter kids might have pursued better educational opportunities, landed higher-status and higher-paying jobs, and therefore ended up in a better position to take care of their health than their less intelligent peers.\n\nMeanwhile, a more recent study found that, among preschoolers, a lower IQ was linked to a higher BMI. Those researchers also say environmental factors are at play, since the relationship between BMI and smarts was mediated by socioeconomic status.\n\n4. You have a cat\n\nA 2014 study of 600 college students found that individuals who identified as \u201cdog people\u201d were more outgoing than those who identified as \u201ccat people,\u201d according to a test that measures personality and intelligence.\n\nBut guess what? Those same cat people scored higher on the part of the test that measures cognitive ability.\n\n5. You were breastfed\n\n2007 research suggests that babies who are breastfed might grow up to be smarter kids.\n\nIn two studies, the researchers looked at more than 3,000 children in Britain and New Zealand. Those children who had been breastfed scored nearly seven points higher on an IQ test \u2014 but only if they had a particular version of the FADS2 gene. (That version of the gene was present in roughly equal numbers among kids who were and weren\u2019t breastfed.)\n\nFiguring out the exact mechanism of this relationship between FADS2, breastfeeding, and IQ will require further study, the scientists noted in their paper on the finding.\n\n6. You\u2019ve used recreational drugs\n\nA 2012 study of more than 6,000 Brits born in 1958 found a link between high IQ in childhood and the use of illegal drugs in adulthood.\n\n\u201cIn our large population-based cohort study, IQ at 11 years was associated with a greater likelihood of using selected illegal drugs 31 years later,\u201d wrote researchers James W. White, Catharine R. Gale, and David Batty.\n\nThey conclude that \u201cin contrast to most studies on the association between childhood IQ and later health,\u201d their findings suggest \u201ca high childhood IQ may prompt the adoption of behaviors that are potentially harmful to health (i.e., excess alcohol consumption and drug use) in adulthood.\u201d\n\n7. You\u2019re lefthanded\n\nLeft-handedness used to be associated with criminality, and researchers are still unclear as to whether and why there are slightly more lefties among criminal populations.\n\nMore recent research associates left-handedness with \u201cdivergent thinking,\u201d a form of creativity that allows you to come up with novel ideas from a prompt \u2014 at least among men.\n\nIn her review of a 1995 paper, New Yorker reporter Maria Konnikova writes:\n\nThe more marked the left-handed preference in a group of males, the better they were at tests of divergent thought.\n\nLeft-handers were more adept, for instance, at combining two common objects in novel ways to form a third \u2014 for example, using a pole and a tin can to make a birdhouse. They also excelled at grouping lists of words into as many alternate categories as possible.\n\n8. You\u2019re tall\n\nA 2008 Princeton study of thousands of people found that taller individuals scored higher on IQ tests as kids and earned more money as adults.\n\nThe researchers write: \u201cAs early as age 3 \u2014 before schooling has had a chance to play a role \u2014 and throughout childhood, taller children perform significantly better on cognitive tests.\u201d\n\n9. You drink alcohol regularly\n\nEvolutionary psychologist Satoshi Kanazawa and colleagues found that, among Brits as well as Americans, adults who had scored higher on IQ tests when they were kids or teens drank more alcohol, more often in adulthood than those who had scored lower.\n\n10. You learned to read early\n\nIn 2012, researchers looked at nearly 2,000 pairs of identical twins in the UK and found that the sibling who had learned to read earlier tended to score higher on tests of cognitive ability.\n\nThe study authors suggest that reading from an early age increases both verbal and nonverbal (e.g. reasoning) ability, as opposed to the other way around.\n\n11. You worry a lot\n\nA growing body of research suggests that anxious individuals may be smarter than others in certain ways, according to Slate\u2019s coverage of several different studies on anxiety.\n\nIn one study, for example, researchers asked 126 undergrads to fill out questionnaires in which they indicated how often they experienced worry. They also indicated how often they engaged in rumination, or thinking continuously about the aspects of situations that upset them, as psychologist Dr. Edward Selby reported in Psychology Today.\n\nResults showed that people who tended to worry and ruminate a lot scored higher on measures of verbal intelligence, while people who didn\u2019t do much worrying or ruminating scored higher on tests of nonverbal intelligence.\n\n12. You\u2019re funny\n\nIn one study, 400 psychology students took intelligence tests that measured abstract reasoning abilities and verbal intelligence.\n\nThen they were asked to come up with captions for several New Yorker cartoons, and those captions were reviewed by independent raters.\n\nAs predicted, smarter students were rated as funnier.\n\n13. You\u2019re curious\n\nIn University of London business psychology professor Tomas Chamorro-Premuzi\u2019s post for Harvard Business Review, he discussed how the curiosity quotient and having a hungry mind makes one more inquisitive.\n\nRegarding the importance of CQ, he wrote that, \u201cIt has not been as deeply studied as EQ and IQ, but there\u2019s some evidence to suggest it is just as important when it comes to managing complexity in two major ways. First, individuals with higher CQ are generally more tolerant of ambiguity. This nuanced, sophisticated, subtle thinking style defines the very essence of complexity. Second, CQ leads to higher levels of intellectual investment and knowledge acquisition over time, especially in formal domains of education, such as science and art (note: this is of course different from IQ\u2019s measurement of raw intellectual horsepower).\u201d\n\nA Goldsmiths University of London study found that intellectual investment, or \u201chow people invest their time and effort in their intellect,\u201d plays a major part in cognitive growth.\n\n14. You\u2019re messy\n\nA study published in \u201cPsychological Science\u201d by the University of Minnesota Carlson School of Management\u2019s Dr. Kathleen Vohs revealed that working in an untidy room actually fuels creativity.\n\nIn the study, 48 participants were asked to come up with unusual uses for a pingpong ball. The 24 individuals working in neat rooms came up with substantially less creative responses than the individuals working in cluttered rooms.\n\nSo if you are a pack rat, tell everyone you\u2019re just fueling your sense of creativity and innovation the next time someone tells you to clean up your act.\n\n15. You didn\u2019t have sex until after high school\n\nHigh schoolers with higher IQs are more likely to be virgins than those with average or lower IQs, according to a study from the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill. The core sample looked at 12,000 teens from the 7th to the 12th grade.\n\nNot only were the teens with the higher IQs more likely to be virgins, they were also less likely to kiss or hold hands with a romantic partner. A number of explanations have been put forward by the science blog Gene Expression to explain this gap, including suggestions that smart people possess lower sex drives, are risk adverse, or simply less able to find sexual partners.\n\n16. You\u2019re a night owl\n\nOne study published in the \u201cThe Official Journal of the International Society for the Study of Individual Differences\u201d found that, when all other variables are factored out, night owls tend to beat out early birds in terms of intellect. It concluded that ethnographic evidence indicates that \u201cnocturnal activities\u201d were rarer in the ancestral environment. That means that more intelligent individuals are more likely to stay up late because smarter people are more likely to \u201cespouse evolutionarily novel values.\u201d\n\n17. You don\u2019t always have to try hard\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say that laziness is a sign of being smart. But it is fair to say that smart people simply don\u2019t always have to try as hard as \u201cstrivers\u201d who fight to build up their skills \u2014 at least in certain fields.In an opinions piece for The New York Times, psychologists David Z. Hambrick and Elizabeth J. Meinz cited a Vanderbilt University study of highly intelligent young people.\n\nThe study tracked 2,000 people who scored in the top 1% of the SAT by the age of 13. Hambrick and Meinz wrote that, \u201cThe remarkable finding of their study is that, compared with the participants who were \u201conly\u201d in the 99.1 percentile for intellectual ability at age 12, those who were in the 99.9 percentile \u2014 the profoundly gifted \u2014 were between three and five times more likely to go on to earn a doctorate, secure a patent, publish an article in a scientific journal or publish a literary work. A high level of intellectual ability gives you an enormous real-world advantage.\u201d\n\nThey concluded that while striving to be smarter is commendable, there are certain innate abilities that can\u2019t always be learned.\n\n18. You don\u2019t constantly need to be around people\n\nWe tend to be happier when we spend more time with friends.\n\nThat is, except for the hyper-intelligent people among us. As Business Insider previously reported, a Singapore Management University and London School of Economics study found that smart people differ from the rest of us when it comes to happiness levels and socialization.\n\nSo if you adore your friends but require a solid chunk of \u201cme time\u201d too, that could be a sign that you\u2019re super smart.\n\n19. You live in a \u2018walkable\u2019 city\n\nAs it turns out, geography could be a pretty good indicator of how smart you are. As Chris Weller wrote for Tech Insider, Smart Growth America\u2019s study found that cities built for pedestrians tend to attract more college grads than cities built for cars. Washington DC scored highest in education and second in walkability, while New York City was voted \u201cthe most walkable metro area\u201d in the US.\n\nDrake Baer and Chelsea Harvey contributed to a previous version of this article."
