Off licences are not listed as essential: however, they have been removed from the list of premises ordered to close.\n\n\n\nIt is for individual off sales to judge and justify remaining open and to provide proper protection for their staff if they do. \u2014 Naomi Long MLA (@naomi_long) March 26, 2020 Report\n\nRobin Swann thanked local businesses for coming forward.\n\nIt is planned that 20,000 ventilators will be manufactured and bought by NHS England and allocated across the UK.\n\nMr Swann said the firms had offered \"their skills and expertise to assist the effort to provide those on the front line with the precious resources that they need\".\n\nThe finance and economy ministers also praised the response.\n\nThey said 30 responses came from companies who will be involved in the UK-wide push to produce ventilators.\n\nThe ministers also said a cross-government PPE group has been established which will oversee orders with a view to expand the number of suppliers to government.\n\nHelp from businesses\n\nMeanwhile, companies in Northern Ireland have offered to help supply critical items.\n\nMore than 100 companies responded to the government's call for help in sourcing critical items in the fight against Covid-19, the health minister said.\n\nVentilators, personal protective equipment (PPE) and hand sanitisers are among the required items.\n\nHe added that staff concerns over PPE were being treated \"very seriously\".\n\nThe director of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN), Pat Cullen, said nurses she had spoken to were \"terrified\" going into their work over the lack of appropriate PPE.\n\nShe said the effort needed to be \"stepped up\" and nurses were \"really, really afraid every day and night\".\n\nImage copyright PA Media Image caption PPE equipment protects healthcare workers\n\n\"Nurses coming off night duty last night contacted me very concerned about this,\" she told BBC Good Morning Ulster.\n\n\"This is not finger pointing. Everyone is trying to do their best, but the bottom line is it's not available in the quantities and at the level that it is needed,\" she said.\n\n\"If you are afraid going into work every night because you do not have the PPE that you need - that's a very difficult place for nurses to be in,\" she added.\n\nThere have been 241 cases of coronavirus in Northern Ireland to date and 10 coronavirus related deaths."
