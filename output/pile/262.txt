And 59 per cent of prospective first-time homebuyers plan to purchase a home within the next two years.\n\nThis year saw a number of changes that affected the costs of ownership. In January, the mortgage stress test came into effect, which lowered affordability for Canadians with conventional mortgages by around 20 per cent, Ratehub.ca says. In addition, through 2018, the Bank of Canada announced three 25-basis-point interest rate hikes. (These increases are almost always immediately followed by mortgage rate hikes at Canada\u2019s major banks.) Meanwhile, home prices in large cities continued to edge upwards.\n\nYoung Canadians most optimistic\n\nRatehub.ca, however, says younger Canadians remain the most optimistic about the prospect of homeownership, with Millennial and Generation Z Canadians leading the charge in homebuying intent. According to the survey, homeownership is a goal for:\n\n87 per cent of Generation Zers\n\n81 per cent of Millennials\n\n64 per cent of Generation Xers\n\n54 per cent of Baby Boomers\n\nCanadians\u2019 high intent to purchase is tempered by several possible homeownership hurdles. When first-time buyers were asked about their primary barrier to entering the housing market:\n\n44 per cent cited insufficient down payment funds\n\n17 per cent cited housing market uncertainty\n\n12 per cent said their household income was too low to enter the housing market\n\n9 per cent preferred to maintain housing flexibility\n\n6 per cent said their credit score was too low to qualify for a mortgage\n\nMany Canadians also expect home prices and mortgage rates to continue their upward trend in 2019. Among Canadians who plan on entering the housing market in 2019, 68 per cent believe mortgage rates will increase next year, while 58 per cent believe home prices will rise.\n\nBetter understanding needed\n\nAn eagerness to enter the housing market, however, hasn\u2019t resulted in a better understanding of mortgage regulations amongst first-time homebuyers, Ratehub.ca says. Forty-seven per centof prospective first-time homebuyers are unaware of mortgage qualification rules that came into effect in 2018.\n\n\u201cThe biggest hurdle for first-time homebuyers is saving up for a down payment,\u201d says James Laird, co-founder of Ratehub Inc. and president of CanWise Financial. \u201cWhile first-time buyers can take advantage of programs like the RRSP Home Buyers\u2019 Plan which are tailored for their needs, buyers can also benefit from building a realistic savings plan to hit their goals.\u201d\n\nThe Canadian Home Builders\u2019 Association (CHBA) has named Bob Finnigan, partner at Herity (Heathwood Homes), CHBA Past President, member of BILD (GTA) and long-time building industry executive, as its Member of the Year.\n\nGreat Gulf and Tridel were among the big winners at the recent 39th Annual BILD Awards, as the Building Industry and Land Development Association (BILD) recognized the top builders and developers, projects and marketing initiatives in the industry.\n\nBefore you get the keys, you and your builder will do a Pre-Delivery Inspection or PDI.
