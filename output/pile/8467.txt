During the break, Federer removed his shoes and summoned the ATP Tour trainer for the first of two times to attend to an undisclosed problem with his feet.\nFederer stayed in the match for a while thereafter. But after Federer had a second visit from the trainer, Canas won the final three games of the set and threw open the championship of this $3.3 million tournament.\nSurprisingly, Federer then went out to join Swiss countryman Yves Allegro for a doubles match against David Ferrer and Tommy Robredo of Spain.\nCanas returned to the tour in September after serving a 15-month drug suspension. Ranked No 8 in June 2005, he won his seventh title earlier this year and was ranked 60th when this event got under way. He lost to Alexander Waske in the final round of qualifying, though, and was on the way home until Malisse dropped out.\nSharapova beats Dechy\nIn a women's third-round match, top-ranked and defending champion Maria Sharapova of Russia stayed on course to repeat with a 7-5, 6-2 win over Nathalie Dechy of France.\nSharapova is playing in her first tournament since early February and is struggling to regain her form. She had four double faults and just one ace, and made 47 unforced errors to go with 24 winners. She has made 97 errors in her two wins, overcoming her miscues by playing well on key points.\n\"I think that's to be expected,\" she said. \"When you don't compete for that amount of time, it's normal. I definitely feel like these matches are getting the rough stuff (out of the way).\n\"It's just good to be back on court and being in some tight situations. I miss that after a while.\"\nSharapova had been idle since retiring from her semifinal at Tokyo with a left hamstring strain, and she said some of her service inconsistency stems from the injury.\n\"In Tokyo I struggled with (the serve) a little bit,\" she said. \"Part of it was probably the leg because that's how I injured it. That limited me from serving a lot in practice.\"\nSharapova's next opponent will be No. 15 seed Vera Zvonareva, who advanced with a 6-3, 6-3 win over Victoria Azarenko on a day that the top women advanced.\nThe men's draw, however, was full of upsets.\nAmerican Mardy Fish, the 21st seed, had a 5-2 lead in the third set tiebreaker but lost the next five points and the match to Paul-Henri Mathieu of France, 7-6 (4), 4-6, 7-6 (5). American Michael Russell had better luck and toppled eleventh-seeded Tomas Berdych of the Czech Republic, 7-6 (2), 6-4. Dmitry Tursunov (20), Marat Safin (23), Dominic Hrbaty (24) and Radek Stepanek (25) also were upset victims."
