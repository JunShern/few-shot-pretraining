(installshield is professional edition)\ncould you suggest me what to do?\n\nin my searches I saw that WiX can do this, but I find it complicated, and i don't have enough time to learn it. i need to deploy the app ASAP.\nThanks alot.\n\nA:\n\nFew hints for using LocalDB in your project:\n\nDownload SQL Express LocalDB 2014 here. You can install it silently with single command like this \nmsiexec /i SqlLocalDB.msi /qn IACCEPTSQLLOCALDBLICENSETERMS=YES\nInclude your .MDF in your VS project and set in properties to Copy if newer so that it gets copied to your bin folder during build so that it is automatically included in the installer.\nAt your app startup (in app.cs) check, if database file exists in desired location (e.g. %PUBLIC%\\YourApp\\Data) (WPF Desktop Application with MDF used locally for all local users). If not, copy the .mdf file from your app install dir to your data dir.\nModify app.config so that your connection string looks like:\n<add name=\"MyContextLocalDB\" connectionString=\"Server=(localdb)\\MSSQLLocalDB; Integrated Security=True; AttachDBFilename=|DataDirectory|\\MyDatabase.mdf; Connection Timeout = 30\" providerName=\"System.Data.SqlClient\" />\n\nConnection timeout should be increased, since LocalDB exe is launched when you first try to connect to it. \nYou can also use Database.CreateIfNotExists, but I have never tried it.\n\n"
