Gilmer'\n- Gregor Masbaum\n- Paul van Wamelen\ndate: 'July 8, 2002'\ntitle: Integral bases for TQFT Modules and unimodular representations of mapping class groups\n---\n\nIntroduction\n============\n\nIntegrality properties of Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev quantum invariants of $3$-manifolds have been studied intensively in the last several years. H. Murakami [@Mu1; @Mu2] showed that the $SU(2)$- and $SO(3)$-invariants at a root of unity $q$ of prime order are algebraic integers. This was reproved in [@MR] and generalised to all classical Lie types in [@MW; @TY] and then to all Lie types in [@Le]. These integrality properties are crucial for establishing the relationship of the invariants with the Casson invariant [@Mu1; @Mu2] and with the perturbative invariants or Ohtsuki series [@OhCambridge; @Oh1; @Le].\n\nQuantum invariants fit into Topological Quantum Field Theories (TQFT). This means in particular that there are representations of mapping class groups associated with them. (Actually the representations are usually only projective-linear; equivalently, one has to consider certain central extensions of mapping class groups here.) If a $3$-manifold $M$ is presented as a Heegaard splitting where two handlebodies are glued together by a diffeomorphism $\\varphi$ along their boundary, the quantum invariant of $M$ can be recovered from the representation of $\\varphi$ on the TQFT-vector space $V({{\\Sigma}})$ associated to the boundary surface ${{\\Sigma}}$.\n\nThe TQFT-representations are finite-dimensional and can be defined over a finite extension of the cyclotomic number field $\\mathbb{Q}(q)$, where the quantum parameter $q$ is a root of unity. They also preserve a non-degenerate Hermitian form $\\langle \\ , \\ \\rangle_{{\\Sigma}}$ on $V({{\\Sigma}})$ (which may or may not be unitary; this usually depends on the choice of the embedding of the cyclotomic field into $\\mathbb{C}$).\n\nA quite striking result was recently announced by Andersen [@An] who proved that in the $SU(n)$ case the representations are asymptotically faithful (here asymptotically means letting the order of $q$ go to infinity). At a fixed root of unity, they are certainly not faithful, as Dehn twists are always represented by matrices of finite order. Roberts [@R] showed that the representations are irreducible in the $SU(2)$-case if the order of $q$ is prime.\n\nAn interesting question is to determine the image of the mapping class group in the TQFT-representations. For the $SU(2)$ and $SO(3)$-theories, the first author proved that in the genus one case the image is a finite group [@G1]. However in higher genus, the image is not finite [@Fu]; in fact, it contains elements of infinite order [@Madeira]. One might hope that this image is equal to the linear transformations which are automorphisms of some (yet to be found) structure, just as a linear transformation of the homology group $H_1({{\\Sigma}};\\mathbb{Z})$ is represented by a mapping class if and only if it preserves the intersection form.\n\nIn this paper we are concerned with integrality properties of the TQFT representations. For simplicity, we restrict ourselves to the $SO(3)$ case; specifically, we use a variant of the $V_p$-theories of [@BHMV2] with $p$ an odd prime. Here, $p$ is the order of the root of unity $q$. Let ${{\\mathcal{O}}}$ denote the ring of algebraic integers in the cyclotomic ground field. The main idea to obtain an integral structure on the TQFT already appears in [@G]. Namely, we define an ${{\\mathcal{O}}}$-submodule ${{\\mathcal{S}_p}}({{\\Sigma}})$ of the TQFT-vector space ${{V_p}}({{\\Sigma}})$ as the ${{\\mathcal{O}}}$-span of vectors represented by connected $3$-manifolds with boundary ${{\\Sigma}}$. The point of this definition is that the submodule ${{\\mathcal{S}_p}}({{\\Sigma}})$ is clearly preserved under the mapping class group.\n\nIt was shown in [@G] that ${{\\mathcal{S}_p}}({{\\Sigma}})$ is always a free finitely generated ${{\\mathcal{O}}}$-module. One can also rescale the Hermitian form $\\langle \\ , \\ \\rangle_{{\\Sigma}}$ on ${{V_p}}({{\\Sigma}})$ to obtain a non-degenerate ${{\\mathcal{O}}}$-valued form $(\\ ,\\ )_{{\\Sigma}}$ on ${{\\mathcal{S}_p}}({{\\Sigma}})$. This relies on the integrality results for the invariants mentioned above.\n\nThe form $(\\ ,\\ )_{{\\Sigma}}$ is again preserved by the mapping class group. In particular, the image of the mapping class group in the TQFT-representation $V_p({{\\Sigma}})$ lies in the subgroup preserving a lattice defined over ${{\\mathcal{O}}}$ and a non-degenerate Hermitian form on it.\n\nIn what sense is ${{\\mathcal{S}_p}}$ a TQFT defined over ${{\\mathcal{O}}}$? For instance one might hope that the form $(\\ ,\\ )_{{\\Sigma}}$ was unimodular. Here, we show that this is indeed the case in genus one and two. This is a consequence of our main result which is to describe explicit bases of ${{\\mathcal{S}_p}}({{\\Sigma}})$ in genus one and two.\n\nIn fact, we will describe two quite different bases in genus one. The first basis is given in Theorem\u00a0\\[firstbasis\\]. It is $$\\{ \\omega, t(\\omega) , t^2(\\omega) , \\ldots , t^{d-1}(\\omega)\\}$$ where $\\omega$ is the element appearing in the surgery axiom of the ${{V_p}}$-theory and $t$ is the twist map. It is easy to see that these elements lie in ${{\\mathcal{S}_p}}(S^1\\times S^1)$ and we use a Vandermonde matrix argument to show that they form a basis. A crucial step is to show that the Hermitian form $(\\ ,\\ )_{S^1\\times S^1}$ is unimodular with respect to this basis.\n\nThe second basis given in Theorem\u00a0\\[secondbasis\\] is of a quite different nature. It is $$\\{ 1, v ,v^2 , \\ldots , v^{d-1}\\}$$ where $v=(z+2)/(1+A)$ (here $z$ is represented by the core of the solid torus). We call it the $v$-basis. This time, it is not even obvious [*a priori*]{} that its elements lie in ${{\\mathcal{S}_p}}(S^1\\times S^1)$. The proof involves two different arguments. One is to show that the ${{\\mathcal{O}}}$-span of the $v$-basis is stable under the twist map. This is shown in Section\u00a0\\[Kauf\\]. In fact, we prove it in the more general context where the skein variable $A$ is an indeterminate rather than a root of unity. The second ingredient is to express $\\omega$ in the $v$-basis and thereby relate the $v$-basis to the first basis. This is done in Section\u00a0\\[2nd\\].\n\nThe $v$-basis lends itself nicely to finding bases in higher genus. In Section\u00a0\\[g2\\], we describe a basis of ${{\\mathcal{S}_p}}(\\Sigma)$ in genus two consisting of $v$-colored links in a genus two handlebody. These links are described by arrangements of curves in a twice punctured disk. Again, the unimodularity of the Hermitian form with respect to this basis is a crucial step in the argument.\n\nIn principle this method can be used to study ${{\\mathcal{S}_p}}(\\Sigma)$ in higher genus as well. It turns out, however, that the Hermitian form $(\\ ,\\ )_{{{\\Sigma}}}$ is not always unimodular. For example, a simple argument given in Section \\[non-uni\\] shows that it cannot be unimodular for surfaces of genus 3 and 5, assuming $p \\equiv 5 \\pmod{8}.$\n\nIn this paper we will not attempt to deal with the higher genus case in general. We only give in Section\u00a0\\[g3\\] a basis of ${{\\mathcal{S}_p}}(\\Sigma)$ for a surface of genus three when $p=5.$ Although in this case the Hermitian form is not unimodular, it is nearly so. This allows us to find a basis easily in this one case.\n\nNote that our definition of ${{\\mathcal{S}_p}}({{\\Sigma}})$ is analogous to the construction of integral modular categories in [@MW]; in both cases one constructs integral structures by considering the span, over the subring of algebraic integers of the coefficient field, of the morphisms of the geometrically defined category (tangles in the case of [@MW], $3$-dimensional cobordisms in the case at hand). It might be that this is not always enough: It is conceivable that one might be able to enlarge ${{\\mathcal{S}_p}}({{\\Sigma}})$ in some way to make the form always unimodular; however this enlargement would not be generated by $3$-cobordisms anymore.\n\nWe conclude the paper by showing how the ${{\\mathcal{S}_p}}$-theory defined over ${{\\mathcal{O}}}$ can be used to prove a divisibility result for the Kauffman bracket of links in $S^3$. This generalizes a result of Cochran and Melvin [@CM] for zero framed links (see also [@OhCambridge; @KS]).\n\n[*Notational conventions.*]{} Throughout the paper, $p\\geq 3$ will be an odd integer, and we put $d=(p-1)/2$. From Section\u00a0\\[elem\\] onwards, $p$ is supposed to be prime.\n\nThe twist map on the Kauffman Bracket module of a solid torus {#Kauf}\n=============================================================\n\nIn this section we define a sequence of submodules $K(n)$ of the Kauffman Bracket skein module of the solid torus $S^1 \\times D^2$ and show that they are preserved under the twist map. We use the notations of [@BHMV1].\n\nSuppose $R$ is a commutative ring with identity and an invertible element $A.$ The universal example is $R={{\\mathbb{Z}}}[A,A^{-1}]$ which we also denote by ${{\\mathbb{Z}}}[A^{\\pm}]$. Recall that the Kauffman bracket skein module $K(M,R)$ of a $3$-manifold $M$ is the free $R$ module generated by isotopy classes of banded links in $M$ modulo the submodule generated by the Kauffman relations.\n\nWe let $z$ denote the skein element of $K(S^1 \\times D^2,R)$ given by the banded link $S^1\\times J,$ where $J$ is a small arc in the interior of $D^2.$\n\nAs is well known, $K(S^1 \\times D^2,R)$ is a free $R$-module on the nonnegative powers of $z,$ where $z^n$ means $n$ parallel copies of $z$. This also makes $K(S^1 \\times D^2,R)$ into an $R$-algebra isomorphic to the polynomial ring $ R [z].$\n\nLet $t:K (S^1 \\times D^2,R) \\rightarrow  K (S^1 \\times D^2,R)$ denote the twist map induced by a full right handed twist on the solid torus. It is well known (see [*e.g.*]{} [@BHMV1]) that there is a basis $ \\{e_i\\}_{i\\ge0}$ of eigenvectors for the twist map. It is defined recursively by $$\\label{ei}\ne_0=1, \\quad e_1=z,  \\quad e_i= z e_{i-1}- e_{i-2} ~.$$ The eigenvalues are given by $$\\label{mui}t(e_i)=\\mu_i e_i, \\text{ where } \\mu_i=(-1)^i A^{i^2+2i} ~.$$\n\n[*Let ${K}(n)$ denote the ${{\\mathbb{Z}}}[A^{\\pm}]$-submodule of $K  (S^1 \\times D^2, {{\\mathbb{Z}}}[A^{\\pm},\\frac 1 {1+A}])$ generated by $\\{1,v,v^2,\\ldots,v^n\\}$, where $$v= \\frac {z+2}{1+A}~.$$* ]{}\n\n\\[tK\\] The twist map $t$ sends $K(n)$ to itself.\n\nConsider the basis $ \\{ (z+2)^i\\}_{i\\ge0}$ of $K (S^1 \\times D^2,{{\\mathbb{Z}}}[A^{\\pm}]).$ The following Lemma gives the change of basis formulas.\n\n\\[changeofbasis\\] For each $n \\ge 1,$ $$(z+2)^{n-1}= \\sum_{k=1}^n \\binom{2n}{n-k} \\frac k n e_{k-1}$$ $$e_{n-1}= \\sum_{i=1}^n (-1)^{n-i}  \\binom{n+i-1}{n-i} (z+2)^{i-1}$$\n\nProve each separately by induction on $n$ using the recursion formula (\\[ei\\]).\n\n[*It follows that $\\binom{2n}{n-k} \\frac k n \\in {{\\mathbb{Z}}},$ which can also be seen directly:*]{} $$\\binom{2n}{n-k} \\frac k n=\n\\binom{2n}{n-k} (1-\\frac {n-k} n) =\n\\binom{2n}{n-k}- 2\\binom{2n-1}{n-k-1}~.$$\n\nIt is enough to show Theorem\u00a0\\[tK\\] for the endomorphism $-At$ in place of $t$. Let us compute $-At$ in the basis $(z+2)^n.$ Note that $-At(e_{i-1})=(-A)^{i^2} e_{i-1}$. $$\\begin{aligned}\n-At\\left((z+2)^{n-1}\\right) & = \\sum_{k=1}^n \\binom{2n}{n-k} \\frac k n  (-A) t(e_{k-1}), \\\\\n &= \\sum_{k=1}^n \\binom{2n}{n-k} \\frac k n (-A)^{k^2} \\sum_{i=1}^k (-1)^{k-i} \\binom {k+i-1}{k-i} (z+2)^{i-1},\\\\\n&= \\sum_{i=1}^n  (-1)^i \n\\left( \\frac 1 n\n\\sum_{k=i}^n k \\binom {2n}{n-k} \\binom {k+i-1}{k-i} A^{k^2} \\right)(z+2)^{i-1},\\\\\n&=  \\sum_{i=1}^n (-1)^{i} S_{1,i,n}(A) (z+2)^{i-1}, \\end{aligned}$$\n\nHere, for $ m \\ge 1,$ we define $$S_{m,i,n}(A)= \\frac 1 n  \\sum_{k=i}^n  k^m \\binom {2n} {n-k}   \\binom {k+i-1}{k-i} A^{k^2}\\in {{\\mathbb{Z}}}[A].$$\n\n\\[at -1\\] $$S_{1,i,n}(-1) = \n\\begin{cases}\n(-1)^n, &i=n\\\\\n0  &i \\ne n\n\\end{cases}$$\n\nIf we put $A=-1,$ then all $\\mu_i=1$ and hence $-At$ is the identity.\n\nThe following formula is a very special case of a transformation formula for terminating hypergeometric series due to Bailey [@B Formula 4.3.1]. This was pointed out to us by Krattenthaler\u2019s [HYP]{} package, [@hyp].\n\n\\[recurs\\] $$S_{m,i,n}= i^2 S_{m-2,i,n} + 2i (2i+1) S_{m-2,i+1,n}$$\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n S_{m,i,n} \n&=\\frac 1 n  \\sum_{k=i}^n  k^{m-2} \\left( (k+i) (k-i) +i^2 \\right) \\binom {2n} {n-k}   \\binom {k+i-1}{k-i} A^{k^2} \\\\\n&= i^2 S_{m-2,i,n}  + \\frac 1 n \\sum_{k=i+1}^n  k^{m-2}  (k+i) (k-i)  \\binom {2n} {n-k}   \\binom {k+i-1}{k-i} A^{k^2} \\\\\n& \\text{ (the term with $k=i$ is zero) }\\\\\n&= i^2 S_{m-2,i,n}  +  \\frac 1 n 2 i (2i+1)\\sum_{k=i+1}^n  k^{m-2} \\binom {2n} {n-k}   \\binom {k+i}{k-i-1} A^{k^2} \\\\\n&= i^2 S_{m-2,i,n} + 2i (2i+1) S_{m-2,i+1,n}\\end{aligned}$$\n\nHere we use the simple identity: $$(k+i)(k-i) \\binom {k+i-1}{k-i} = 2i (2i+1) \\binom {k+i}{k-i-1}$$\n\n\\[eq2.7\\] \\[divis\\] $S_{1,i,n}(A)$ is divisible by $(1+A)^{n-i}$ in ${{\\mathbb{Z}}}[A]$ for $i \\le n.$\n\nIt suffices to show: $$\\label{eq2}  \n\\left[ \\left( \\frac {d} {dA} \\right) \n^{k}\nS_{1,i,n}(A) \\right]_{A=-1} =0$$ for all $k=0,1,\\ldots , n-i-1$.

Then a similar argument shows that $\\tilde {K}(n)$ is stable under $t^2$, the square of the twist map. (To see this, one should replace $-At$ with $A^2 t^2$ in the above and express everything in terms of $q=A^2$. This leads to polynomials $\\tilde S_{m,i,n}(q)$ defined similarly as the $ S_{m,i,n}(A)$ except that $A$ is replaced with $q$ and an extra factor of $(-1)^k$ is inserted in the sum. The remainder of the argument is the same.)* ]{}\n\nThe $SO(3)$-TQFTs\n=================\n\nLet $p\\geq 3$ be an odd integer. (In this section, $p$ need not be prime.) We consider a variation of the $2+1$ dimensional cobordism category considered in [@BHMV2] whose objects are closed oriented surfaces (with extra structure) with a (possibly empty) collection of banded points ($=$ small oriented arcs) colored by integers in the range $[0,p-2].$ The morphisms are (equivalence classes of) oriented 3-dimensional manifolds (with extra structure) with $p$-admissibly colored banded trivalent graphs. (Two morphisms are considered equivalent if they are related by a homeomorphism respecting the boundary identifications.) For the definition of $p$-admissibility in the $p$-odd case see [@BHMV2 Theorem 1.15]; see also Section\u00a0\\[g2\\].\n\nThe variation consists of replacing the $p_1$-structures of [@BHMV2] with structures put forward by Walker [@W] and Turaev [@Tu]. Surfaces are equipped with a Lagrangian subspace of their first homology. We use homology with rational coefficients when considering Lagrangian subspaces. Cobordisms are equipped with integer weights, as well as Lagrangian subspaces for the target and source. This is also described in [@G]. We will denote this category by $\\mathcal{C}.$ We call the objects of this category e-surfaces, and call the morphisms 3-e-manifolds.\n\nThe procedure of [@BHMV2] defines a TQFT-functor ${{V_p}}$ on $\\mathcal{C}$ over a commutative ring $R$ containing $p^{-1}$, a primitive 2pth root of unity $A$ and a solution of $\\kappa^2= A^{ -6- p(p+1)/2 }.$ The number $\\kappa$ here plays the role of $\\kappa^3$ in [@BHMV2]. Here we use the term TQFT slightly loosely as the tensor product axiom does not hold unless only even colors are used in the cobordism category. The even colors correspond to irreducible representations of $SU(2)$ which lift to $SO(3)$. Therefore the ${{V_p}}$-theory for odd $p$ is considered a $SO(3)$ variant of the Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev $SU(2)$-TQFT.\n\nFor us it is convenient to use odd colors as well as even colors. However, if we insist that only even colors be used in coloring the banded points on the surfaces, then we do obtain an honest TQFT with the tensor product axiom, but we are still allowed us to use the language of odd colors to describe states. This will be useful in Sections\u00a0\\[g2\\] and\u00a0\\[g3\\].\n\nIf $M$ is a 3-e-manifold viewed as morphism from ${{\\Sigma}}$ to ${{\\Sigma}}'$ in $\\mathcal{C}$, we denote the associated endomorphism from ${{V_p}}({{\\Sigma}})$ to ${{V_p}}({{\\Sigma}}')$ by ${{Z_p}}(M)$. (It is denoted by $(Z_p)_M$ in [@BHMV2]). If $M$ is a closed 3-e-manifold viewed as morphism from $\\emptyset$ to $\\emptyset,$ ${{Z_p}}(M)$ induces multiplication by a scalar from $R=  V(\\emptyset).$ This scalar is denoted by $\\langle M\\rangle.$ If $M$ is a 3-e-manifold viewed as morphism from $\\emptyset$ to $\\Sigma,$ let $[M]$ denote ${{Z_p}}(M)(1) \\in V(\\Sigma).$ ($[M]$ is denoted by $Z_p(M)$ in [@BHMV2]). We call such an element $[M]$ a [*vacuum state.*]{} If $M$ is connected, $[M]$ is called a connected vacuum state.\n\nThe modules ${{V_p}}({{\\Sigma}})$ are always free over $R$. They also carry a nonsingular Hermitian form [@BHMV2] : $$\\langle \\ ,\\ \\rangle _{\\Sigma}: {{V_p}}(\\Sigma) \\times {{V_p}}(\\Sigma) \\rightarrow R$$ given by $$\\langle [N_1],[N_2]\\rangle _{\\Sigma}= \\langle N_1 \\cup_{\\Sigma} -N_2\\rangle~.$$ Here $-N_2$ is the 3-e-manifold obtained by reversing the orientation, multiplying the weight by $-1, $ and leaving the Lagrangian on the boundary alone.\n\nIf $\\Sigma$ is an e-surface with no colored points, and $H$ is a handlebody (weighted zero) with boundary $\\Sigma,$ then ${{V_p}}(\\Sigma)$ has a specified isomorphism to a quotient of the skein module $K(H,R)$ [@BHMV2 p. 891]. In fact if $H$ is a subset of $S^3$ then two skeins represent the same element if and only if they are equal as \u201cmaps of outsides\u201d in Lickorish\u2019s phrase [@L].\n\nLet $S^1 \\times S^1$ denote an e-surface of genus one with no colored points. Let $d$ denote $(p-1)/ 2.$ It turns out that $d$ is the dimension or rank of ${{V_p}}(S^1 \\times S^1).$ In fact, the module ${{V_p}}(S^1 \\times S^1) $ is isomorphic as an $R$-module to the quotient of $K(S^1 \\times D^2,R)=R[z]$ by the ideal generated by $e_d- e_{d-1}\\in R[z].$ It follows [@BHMV1 p.696] that $e_{p-1}=0$ in ${{V_p}}(S^1 \\times S^1) $ and $e_{d+i}= e_{d-1-i}.$ Thus the module ${{V_p}}(S^1 \\times S^1) $ has indeed rank $d$ with the basis $\\{e_0,e_1,\\ldots ,e_{d-1}\\}$. Note that this basis is the same, up to reordering, as the even basis $\\{e_0,e_2,\\ldots, e_{p-3}\\}.$\n\nLet $\\Sigma_g$ denote an e-surface of genus $g$ with no colored points on the boundary. The rank of the free module ${{V_p}}(\\Sigma_g)$ is given by the formula [@BHMV2 Cor. 1.16] $$\\text{rank}\\left({{V_p}}(\\Sigma_g)\\right) = \\left( \\frac p 4\\right)^{g-1} \\sum_{j=1}^{d}\n \\left( \\sin \\frac {2 \\pi j}{p} \\right)^{2-2g} .$$ This is the same as $2^{-g}$ times the dimension of $V_{2p}({{\\Sigma}}_g)$ (this fact comes from a tensor product formula, see [@BHMV2 Thm. 1.5]). Note that $V_{2p}({{\\Sigma}}_g)$ is an $SU(2)$-TQFT module, with dimension given by the $SU(2)$ Verlinde formula at level $p-2$ (where the colors are again the set of integers in the range $[0,p-2]$).\n\nIn genus 2, we have $$\\text{rank}\\left({{V_p}}(\\Sigma_2)\\right)= \\frac {d (d+1)(2d+1)}{6}$$ as will be seen by an explicit counting argument in Section\u00a0\\[g2\\].\n\nSome facts from elementary number theory {#elem}\n========================================\n\nIn the remainder of this paper, we assume $p$ is an odd prime. We continue to use the notation $d=(p-1)/2$.\n\nIn this section, we collect some notation and a few elementary number-theoretical facts. To be specific we pick particular values for $A$ and $\\kappa$. We put $A= \\zeta_{2p}$ where $\\zeta_n = e^{2 \\pi i/{n}},$ and also use the notation[^1] $$q=A^2.$$ We may then take $\\kappa = A^{-3}(-i)^{({p+1})/{2}}.$ Note that $\\zeta_{2p}\\in {{\\mathbb{Z}}}[\\zeta_p]$. Thus the coefficient ring is $R ={{\\mathbb{Z}}}[\\zeta_p, \\frac 1 p]$ if $p \\equiv -1 \\pmod{4},$ and $R ={{\\mathbb{Z}}}[\\zeta_{p},i, \\frac 1 p]={{\\mathbb{Z}}}[\\zeta_{4p}, \\frac 1 p]$ if $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}.$ Of course, the coefficient ring remains unchanged if $A$ is replaced by another primitive $2p$-th root of unity, and $\\kappa$ is changed accordingly.\n\nWe let $\\eta$ denote $\\langle S^3\\rangle$, the invariant of $S^3$ with weight zero, and put $\\mathcal{D}= \n\\eta^{-1}$. Then using equations on [@BHMV2 p.897] $$\\label{D}\n  \\mathcal{D} = \\frac{i\\ \\sqrt{p} }{q-q^{-1}} = \\frac{i^{\\frac {p+1} 2} }{q-q^{-1}} \n\\left(\\frac 1 2 \\sum _{m=1}^{2p}(-1)^m A^{m^2}\\right)$$ In particular $$\\label{DD} \\mathcal{D}^2= \\frac {-p}{ ({q-q^{-1}})^2}~.$$\n\nWe denote by $\\mathcal{O} $ the ring of integers in $R.$ Note that $\\mathcal{O}={{\\mathbb{Z}}}[\\zeta_p]$ if $p \\equiv -1 \\pmod{4},$ and $\\mathcal{O}  ={{\\mathbb{Z}}}[\\zeta_{p},i]={{\\mathbb{Z}}}[\\zeta_{4p}]$ if $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}.$\n\nThe following notation will be useful. If $x,y$ are elements of ${{\\mathcal{O}}}$ (or, more generally, of its quotient field), we write $x\\sim y$ if there exists a unit $u\\in {{\\mathcal{O}}}$ such that $x=uy$.\n\n\\[num\\]\n\n-   $1-A$ is a unit in ${{\\mathcal{O}}}$, and $1-q\\sim 1+A$.\n\n-   One has $\\mathcal{D}\\in {{\\mathcal{O}}}$. Moreover, $\\mathcal{D}\\sim (1-q)^{({p-3})/2}=(1-q)^{d-1}$.\n\n-   The quantum integers $[n]=(q^n-q^{-n})/(q-q^{-1})$ are units for $1\\leq n\\leq p-1$.\n\n-   If $0\\leq i,j \\leq d-1$ and $i\\neq j$, then the twist coefficients $\\mu_i$ (see (\\[mui\\])) satisfy $\\mu_i-\\mu_j\\sim 1-q$.\n\n-   Put $\\lambda_i=-q^{i+1}-q^{-i-1}$. If $0\\leq i \\leq d-1$, then $\\lambda_0-\\lambda_i\\sim (1-q)^2$.\n\nThe fact that $1-A$ is a unit follows easily from the fact that $A$ is a zero of the $2p$-th cyclotomic polynomial $1-X+X^2-\\ldots +X^{p-1}$. This proves (i). It is well-known that $p\\sim (1-q)^{p-1}$ (see [*e.g.*]{} [@MR Lemma 3.1]). Together with Formulas (\\[D\\]) and (\\[DD\\]), this shows (ii). Observing that $[n]\\sim\n1+q^2+\\ldots +q^{2n-2}$, (iii) is also shown in [@MR Lemma 3.1]. For (iv), observe that $\\mu_i=\\mu_{p-2-i}$ so that the set of $\\mu_i$ in question is equal to the set of $\\mu_{2i}=q^{\n2 i^2+2i}$ for $i=0,1,\\ldots d-1$. These powers of $q$ are all distinct, which implies $$\\mu_i-\\mu_j \\sim 1-q^n \\sim 1-q$$ for some $0<n<p$. This proves (iv). Similarly, (v) follows from $\\lambda_0-\\lambda_i\\sim(1-q^{i+2})(1-q^i)$.\n\n[*It is well-known that $1-q$ is a prime in ${{\\mathbb{Z}}}[q]={{\\mathbb{Z}}}[\\zeta_{p}]$. But if $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4},$ then $1-q$ is not a prime in ${{\\mathcal{O}}}={{\\mathbb{Z}}}[\\zeta_{4p}]$ (it splits as a product of two conjugate prime ideals).* ]{}\n\nAssociated Integral Cobordism Functors\n======================================\n\nIn [@G], a cobordism functor from a restricted cobordism category to the category of free finitely generated $\\mathcal{O}$-modules is described. Let $\\mathcal{C''}$ denote the subcategory of $\\mathcal{C}$ defined by considering only nonempty connected surfaces and connected morphisms between such surfaces. This represents a further restriction of $\\mathcal{C}$ than that considered in [@G], but it suffices for our purposes.\n\n[*If $\\Sigma$ is a connected e-surface, define ${{\\mathcal{S}_p}}(\\Sigma)$ to be the $\\mathcal{O}$-submodule of ${{V_p}}(\\Sigma)$ generated by connected vacuum states. If $N: \\Sigma \\rightarrow \\Sigma'$ is a morphism of $\\mathcal{C''}$ then ${{Z_p}}(N)$ sends $ [M] \\in {{\\mathcal{S}_p}}(\\Sigma)$ to $[M \\cup_{\\Sigma}N] \\in {{\\mathcal{S}_p}}(\\Sigma').$ In this way we get a functor from $\\mathcal{C''}$ to the category of finitely generated $\\mathcal{O}$-modules. We also rescale the Hermitian form on ${{V_p}}(\\Sigma)$ to obtain an $\\mathcal{O}$-valued Hermitian form $$(\\ ,\\ )_{\\Sigma}: {{\\mathcal{S}_p}}(\\Sigma) \n\\otimes_{{\\mathcal{O}}}{{\\mathcal{S}_p}}(\\Sigma) \\rightarrow \\mathcal{O},$$ defined by $$([N_1],[N_2])_{\\Sigma}= \n\\mathcal{D} \\langle [N_1],[N_2]\\rangle_{\\Sigma} =\n\\mathcal{D} \\langle N_1 \\cup_{\\Sigma} -N_2\\rangle\n.$$* ]{}**\n\nThis form takes values in $\\mathcal{O}$ by the integrality result for closed 3-e-manifolds [@Mu2; @MR]. These theorems are also used in proving that ${{\\mathcal{S}_p}}(\\Sigma)$ is finitely generated [@G].\n\n[*Over a Dedekind domain such as ${{\\mathcal{O}}}$, a finitely generated torsion-free module is always projective, but it need not be free. (The typical examples are non-principal ideals in ${{\\mathcal{O}}}$.) Somewhat surprisingly, however, it turns out that the modules ${{\\mathcal{S}_p}}(\\Sigma)$ are always free. This is proved in [@G]. We will not actually make use of this fact in genus $1$ and $2$: freeness will follow from the construction of explicit bases.* ]{}\n\n[*A Hermitian form on a projective ${{\\mathcal{O}}}$-module $S$ is called [*non-degenerate*]{} (or [*non-singular*]{}) if its adjoint map $S\\rightarrow S^*$ is injective. It is called [*unimodular*]{} if the adjoint map is an isomorphism.* ]{}\n\nNote that if $S$ is free and $M$ is the matrix of the Hermitian form in some basis, then the form is non-degenerate (resp. unimodular) if $\\det M$ is non-zero (resp. a unit in ${{\\mathcal{O}}}$).\n\nIn our situation, the form $ (\\ ,\\ )_{\\Sigma}$ is always non-degenerate (since the original form $\\langle \\ ,\\ \\rangle_{{\\Sigma}}$ on ${{V_p}}({{\\Sigma}})$ is). We will show that $ (\\ ,\\ )_{\\Sigma}$ is unimodular in genus $1$ and $2$. There is a standard basis $\\{u_\\sigma\\}$ of ${{V_p}}(\\Sigma_g)$ given by p-admissible [ *even*]{} colorings $\\sigma$ of the graph\n\n(-.5,-.2)(5,1) (0,.5)[.35]{} (1,.5)[.35]{} (.35,.5)(.65,.5) (1.35,.5)(1.65,.5) (3.35,.5)(3.65,.5) (4,.5)[.35]{} (2,.45)[$\\cdots$]{}\n\n(where there are $g$ loops) embedded in a 3-e-handlebody $H_g$ of genus $g$ with boundary the e-surface ${{\\Sigma}}_g$ (see [@BHMV2 4.11]). One may actually use any trivalent graph in $H_g$ to which $H_g$ deformation retracts. (In the case $g=1$, this is the same as the basis given by the elements $e_i$.) These basis elements lie in ${{\\mathcal{S}_p}}(\\Sigma_g)$ because the denominators appearing in the Jones-Wenzl idempotents needed to expand colored graphs into skein elements are invertible in ${{\\mathcal{O}}}$ (see [@MR]). Warning: the $u_\\sigma$ do [*not*]{} generate ${{\\mathcal{S}_p}}(\\Sigma_g)$ over ${{\\mathcal{O}}}$.\n\n\\[detb\\] The elements $u_\\sigma$ are orthogonal for the form $(\\ ,\\ )_{\\Sigma_g}.$ Moreover, one has $$(u_\\sigma,u_\\sigma)_{\\Sigma_g}\\sim {{\\mathcal{D}}}^g\\sim (1-q)^{(d-1)g}.$$\n\nBy [@BHMV2 Theorem 4.11] one has that $\\langle u_\\sigma,u_\\sigma\\rangle_{\\Sigma_g}$ is equal to $\\eta^{1-g}={{\\mathcal{D}}}^{g-1}$ times a product of non-zero quantum integers or their inverses, which are units in ${{\\mathbb{Z}}}[q]$ by Lemma\u00a0\\[num\\]. Since the form $(\\ ,\\ )_{\\Sigma_g} $ is just a rescaling of the form $\\langle \\ ,\\ \\rangle_{\\Sigma_g} $, the result follows.\n\nOne of the reasons to study the form $(\\ ,\\ )_{\\Sigma_g} $ is that it is preserved by the TQFT-action of the mapping class group. More precisely, let $\\tilde{\\Gamma}(\\Sigma)$ denote the central extension of the mapping class group $\\Gamma(\\Sigma)$ of $\\Sigma$ realized by the subcategory of $C''$ consisting of e-manifolds homeomorphic to $\\Sigma \\times I$ such that the colored graph is given by $I$ times the colored banded points of $\\Sigma.$ This homeomorphism need not respect the boundary identification at $\\Sigma \\times \\{1\\},$ but should respect the boundary identification at $\\Sigma \\times \\{0\\}.$ In fact considering this boundary identification at $\\Sigma \\times \\{1\\},$ defines the quotient homomorphism from $\\tilde{\\Gamma}(\\Sigma)$ to $\\Gamma(\\Sigma),$ which has kernel ${{\\mathbb{Z}}}$ given by the integral weights on $\\Sigma \\times I$ with standard boundary identifications. The group $\\tilde \\Gamma(\\Sigma)$ is isomorphic to the signature extension (see [*e.g.*]{} Atiyah [@At], Turaev [@Tu].) This extension can be described nicely using skein theory [@MR1].\n\nThe group $\\tilde \\Gamma(\\Sigma)$ acts on ${{V_p}}(\\Sigma)$ preserving the $\\mathcal{O}$-lattice ${{\\mathcal{S}_p}}(\\Sigma)$ and the ${{\\mathcal{O}}}$-valued Hermitian form $ (\\ ,\\ )_{\\Sigma}$.\n\nThis follows from the definition of ${{\\mathcal{S}_p}}(\\Sigma)$ and the fact that the group $\\tilde \\Gamma(\\Sigma)$ preserves the original Hermitian form $ \\langle\\ ,\\ \\rangle_{\\Sigma}$.\n\nThe module ${{\\mathcal{S}_p}}(\\Sigma)$ can be described using the notion of \u2018mixed graph\u2019. Recall the element $$\\omega= {{\\mathcal{D}}}^{-1} \\sum_{i=0}^{d-1}  \\langle e_i\\rangle e_i \\in K(S^1 \\times D^2,R).$$ Here $\\langle e_i\\rangle=(-1)^i [i+1]$. It plays an important role in the surgery axioms of the ${{V_p}}$-theory.\n\nBy a [*mixed graph*]{} in a weighted 3-manifold $M, $ we mean a trivalent banded graph in $M$ whose simple closed curve components may possibly be colored $\\omega$ or by integer colors in the range $[ 0,p-2]$ and whose other edges are colored p-admissibly by integers in the range $[ 0,p-2]$. A mixed graph can be expanded multilinearly into a $R$-linear combination of colored graphs. The result should be thought of as a superposition of e-morphisms. If the graph is a link and every component is colored $\\omega,$ we say the link is $\\omega$-colored. A mixed graph in a handlebody $H$ specifies an element in ${{V_p}}(\\partial H).$\n\n\\[ml\\] A mixed graph in a connected 3-e-manifold $M$ with boundary $\\Sigma$ represents an element of ${{\\mathcal{S}_p}}(\\Sigma).$ If $H$ is a 3-e-handlebody with boundary e-surface $\\Sigma$ then ${{\\mathcal{S}_p}}(\\Sigma)$ is generated over $\\mathcal{O}$ by elements specified by mixed graphs in $H.$\n\nThe first statement follows from the fact that ${{V_p}}$ satisfies the surgery axiom (S2) [@BHMV2 p 889]. The second statement follows from the fact that any connected 3-manifold with boundary $\\Sigma$ can be obtained by a sequence of 2-surgeries to $H$ [@BHMV2 Proof of Lemma p. 891].\n\n\\[5.7\\] [*Suppose that we know that some collection $T$ of elements of ${{V_p}}(\\Sigma)$ lie in the $\\mathcal{O}$-lattice ${{\\mathcal{S}_p}}(\\Sigma).$ Then $\\text{Span}_\\mathcal{O}(T)$ is a $\\mathcal{O}$-sublattice of ${{\\mathcal{S}_p}}(\\Sigma).$ This sublattice might not be invariant under $\\tilde{\\Gamma}(\\Sigma)$. Let $G=\\{g_i\\} \\in \\tilde \\Gamma(\\Sigma)$ be a finite set of elements whose image in $\\Gamma(\\Sigma)$ generate.

This procedure is well suited to computer investigation. The basis given in Section\u00a0\\[2nd\\] was originally found by this procedure.

We have that $$t^j (\\omega)= {{\\mathcal{D}}}^{-1} \\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} \\langle e_i\\rangle \\mu_i^j e_i~.$$ Note that $\\langle e_i\\rangle=(-1)^i [i+1]$ is a unit by Lemma\u00a0\\[num\\](iii). The matrix $W$ which expresses $\\{ \\omega, t(\\omega) , t^2(\\omega) , \\ldots , t^{d-1}(\\omega)\\}$ in terms of $\\{e_0,e_1,\\ldots e_{d-1}\\}$ has as determinant a unit (the product of the $\\langle e_i\\rangle$) times ${{\\mathcal{D}}}^{-d}$ times the determinant of the Vandermonde matrix $[  \\mu_i^j ]$ where $0 \\le i,  j\\le d-1.$ Moreover by Lemma\u00a0\\[num\\](iv) $$\\det [  \\mu_i^j ] = \\pm \\prod_{i<j} (\\mu_i-\\mu_j)\\sim  (1-q)^{{d(d-1)}/2}~.$$\n\nAs ${{\\mathcal{D}}}\\sim   (1-q)^{d-1},$ we conclude that $$\\label{detW} \\det W\\sim (1-q)^{- {d(d-1)}/2}~.$$\n\nIn particular, this determinant is non-zero, hence the $t^j(\\omega)$ are linearly independent. Let $\\mathcal {W}$ denote the $\\mathcal{O}$-module spanned by the $t^j(\\omega)$. Clearly $\\mathcal W \\subset {{\\mathcal{S}_p}}(S^1 \\times S^1)$.

The entries of the $S$-matrix in the $e_i$-basis are well-known. One can therefore write down its entries in the $v$-basis (using the change of basis formulas in Lemma\u00a0\\[changeofbasis\\]). The fact that these entries lie in ${{\\mathcal{O}}}$ is by no means obvious. We originally proved this fact using some identities involving binomial coefficients.

We found proofs of these identities using Zeilberger\u2019s algorithm together with some identities from [@B] as above. In particular the [Gosper]{} command in the Mathematica package \u201cFast Zeilberger\u201d (V 2.61) by Peter Paule and Markus Schorn, [@Zeil] was used.

This implies the Lemma.\n\nLet $ r=d (d+1)(2d+1)/{6}$ be the rank of ${{V_p}}(\\Sigma_2)$.

Moreover, one has $\\mathcal {G}\\subset{{\\mathcal{S}^+_p}}({{\\Sigma}}_g)$, where $\\mathcal {G}$ is the colored graph basis of ${{V_p}}({{\\Sigma}}_g)$ (see Proposition\u00a0\\[detb\\]).\n\nThe matrix of $(\\ ,\\ )_{{{\\Sigma}}_g}$ with respect to $\\mathcal {G}$ has determinant ${{\\mathcal{D}}}^{gr}\\sim (1-q)^{(d-1)gr}$ where $r$ denotes the rank of ${{V_p}}({{\\Sigma}}_g)$. Let $\\mathcal {B}$ be a basis of the free ${{\\mathcal{O}}}^+$-module ${{\\mathcal{S}^+_p}}({{\\Sigma}}_g)$, and let $D$ be the determinant of the matrix expressing $\\mathcal {B}$ in terms of $\\mathcal {G}$. The matrix of $(\\ ,\\ )_{{{\\Sigma}}_g}$ with respect to the basis $\\mathcal {B}$ has determinant $\\sim \\Delta$, where $$\\label{Delta} \n\\Delta =   D \\overline D \n(1-q)^{(d-1)gr}~.$$ If the form is unimodular, $\\Delta$ must be a unit in ${{\\mathcal{O}}}$, and since $\\Delta$ lies in ${{\\mathcal{O}}}^+$, it must be a unit in ${{\\mathcal{O}}}^+$. But $1-q$ is a self-conjugate prime in ${{\\mathcal{O}}}^+={{\\mathbb{Z}}}[q]={{\\mathbb{Z}}}[\\zeta_{p}]$, and since $D^{-1}$ lies in ${{\\mathcal{O}}}^+$ as well, $\\Delta$ can be a unit only if $(d-1)gr$ is even. Thus one of $g$ and $r$ must be even (since $d-1=(p-3)/2$ is odd in our situation). This completes the proof.\n\n\\[9.4\\] [*The use of the ${{\\mathcal{O}}}^+$-module ${{\\mathcal{S}^+_p}}({{\\Sigma}}_g)$ can in general not be avoided in this argument. Here is why. Recall that $1-q$ splits in ${{\\mathcal{O}}}={{\\mathbb{Z}}}[\\zeta_{4p}]$ as the product of two conjugate prime ideals $\\mathfrak{p}$ and $\\overline{\\mathfrak{p}}$. If $\\mathfrak p$ is principal (this happens for example if $p=5$), then there exists $D\\in {{\\mathcal{O}}}$ such that the number $\\Delta$ defined as in (\\[Delta\\]) is a unit even when $(d-1)gr$ is odd.

This is suggested by Corollary \\[v\\] and the fact that ${{\\mathcal{S}_p}}({{\\Sigma}}_g)$ is a free ${{\\mathcal{O}}}$-module [@G]. In fact, we now find such a set of links giving a basis for $\\mathcal{S}^+_5({{\\Sigma}}_3)$ (and therefore also for $\\mathcal{S}_5({{\\Sigma}}_3)$) by adapting the above procedures. These links are described by arrangements of curves in a thrice punctured disk. Although the Hermitian form and the related ${{\\mathcal{O}}}^+$-valued sesquilinear form are not unimodular, in this particular situation they are nearly so, and this is essential for our argument. It seems more difficult to find an explicit collection of banded links with this property for $\\mathcal{S}_p({{\\Sigma}}_3)$ for $p>5,$ and for $\\mathcal{S}_p({{\\Sigma}}_g)$ for $g>4.$ We plan to return to this question elsewhere.\n\nWe think of the handlebody $H_3$ as $P_3 \\times I$ where $P_3$ is a disk with three holes. We give $H_3$ weight zero.

This summarises 5-admissibility in this case. There are 15 such colorings. Again using Wenzl\u2019s recursion formula, there is a triangular change of basis with ones on the diagonal from the basis $\\mathcal{G}$ to the set $\\mathcal{A}$ which is therefore also a basis of $V_5({{\\Sigma}}_3)$.\n\nRecall that ${{\\mathcal{A}}}(v)$ consists of the $15$ elements of ${{\\mathcal{S}^+_5}}(\\Sigma_3)$ obtained by replacing each of the 22 curves in ${{\\mathcal{A}}}$ with $v=(z+2)/(1+A)$. Again there is a triangular change of basis matrix from ${{\\mathcal{A}}}$ to ${{\\mathcal{A}}}(v)$. Therefore the elements of ${{\\mathcal{A}}}(v)$ span $V_5({{\\Sigma}}_3)$ and hence are linearly independent over ${{\\mathcal{O}}}^+$. Consider the inclusion $$\\label{strict}\n\\text{Span}_{{{\\mathcal{O}}}^+}{{\\mathcal{A}}}(v) \\subset {{\\mathcal{S}^+_5}}(\\Sigma_3)~.$$ The matrix for $(\\ ,\\ )^+_{\\Sigma}$ with respect to $\\mathcal{A }(v)$ has determinant $\\sim (1-q)^{3\\cdot 15-2 \\cdot 22}=1-q.$ Since $1-q$ is a prime in ${{\\mathcal{O}}}^+ $ and ${{\\mathcal{S}^+_5}}(\\Sigma_3)$ is also a free ${{\\mathcal{O}}}^+$-module, we conclude that the inclusion (\\[strict\\]) cannot be strict. Thus $\\mathcal{A }(v)$ is a basis for ${{\\mathcal{S}^+_5}}(\\Sigma_3).$\n\n[*Theorem \\[thg3\\] remains true if we replace $v$ by $\\omega$ throughout. The same proof works.*]{}\n\n[*As in Remark\u00a0\\[9.4\\], it is crucial for this argument to use ${{\\mathcal{S}^+_5}}({{\\Sigma}}_3)$ rather than ${{\\mathcal{S}_5}}({{\\Sigma}}_3)$, since for $p=5$ there exists $a\\in {{\\mathcal{O}}}={{\\mathbb{Z}}}[\\zeta_{20}]$ such that $1-q=a\\overline{a}$.*]{}\n\n[*Kerler has announced in [@Ke] a construction of integral bases for the Reshetikhin-Turaev $SO(3)$ TQFT at the prime $p=5$ for any genus.*]{}\n\nA divisibility result for the Kauffman bracket\n==============================================\n\nIn this final section, we let $A$ again be an indeterminant. The fact that $v=(z+2)/(1+\n\\zeta_{2p}\n)$ lies in ${{\\mathcal{S}_p}}(S^1\\times S^1)$ for all odd primes $p$ has the following application to the Kauffman bracket $\\langle\\ \\rangle$ of banded links in $S^3$.\n\n\\[th11\\] Let $L$ be a banded link in $S^3$ with $\\mu$ components. Let $L(z+2)$ denote this link colored $z+2.$ Then the Kauffman Bracket $\\langle L(z+2) \\rangle \\in {{\\mathbb{Z}}}[A^{\\pm}]$ is divisible by $(1+A)^{\\mu}$.\n\nHere the Kauffman bracket is normalized so that the bracket of the empty link is $\\langle \\emptyset\\rangle=1$. Note that $$\\langle L(z+2)\\rangle = \\sum_{L'\\subset L} 2^{\\mu-\\mu(L')} \n\\langle L'\\rangle~,$$ where the sum is over all sublinks $L'$ of $L$, and $\\mu(L')$ denotes the number of components of $L'$.\n\nWhen we evaluate the Kauffman bracket $\\langle J \\rangle$ of a banded link $J$ in $S^3$ at $A=\\zeta_{2p}$, we obtain the quantum invariant of the pair $(S^3,J)$ (where $S^3$ is given the weight zero) in the normalization $$\\langle J \\rangle\\vert_{A=\\zeta_{2p}}=I_p(S^3,J)=\\frac {\\langle (S^3,J) \\rangle} {\\langle S^3 \\rangle}={{\\mathcal{D}}}{\\langle (S^3,J) \\rangle} ~.$$ This normalization $I_p(M,J)$ of the quantum invariant is precisely the one which is always an algebraic integer [@Mu1; @MR] and which is at the basis of the integral cobordism functors ${{\\mathcal{S}_p}}$.\n\nLet $f(A)$ denote the Kauffman bracket $\\langle L(z+2)\\rangle \\in {{\\mathbb{Z}}}[A^\\pm].$ Since $v= (z+2)/(1+\n\\zeta_{2p}\n)\\in S_p(S^1 \\times S^1),$ we have $I_p(S^3,L(v)) \\in {{\\mathbb{Z}}}[\\zeta_{2p}],$ for every odd prime $p.$ Thus $$\\label{divisi}\nf(\\zeta_{2p}) = I_p(S^3,L(z+2)) \\in (1+\\zeta_{2p})^\\mu {{\\mathbb{Z}}}[\\zeta_{2p}],$$ for every odd prime $p.$\n\nNow recall the following elementary Lemma (see [@Mu1 Lemma 5.5] and note that $-\\zeta_{2p}$ is a primitive $p$-th root).\n\nSuppose $f(A) \\in {{{\\mathbb{Z}}}} [A^\\pm].$ Let $f^{(k)}(A)$ denote the $k$-th derivative of $f(A)$. Assume $0\\leq \\mu<p$ where $p$ is prime. Then $f(\\zeta_{2p})\\in {{{\\mathbb{Z}}}} [\\zeta_{p} ]$ is divisible by $(1+\\zeta_{2p})^\\mu$ if and only if $f^{(k)}(-1)\\equiv 0\\pmod{p}$ for every $0\\le k< \\mu.$\n\nBy this lemma, (\\[divisi\\]) implies $f^{(k)}(-1)\\equiv 0\\pmod{p}$ for each $0\\le k< \\mu,$ provided $p$ is larger than $\\mu.$ Since there are infinitely many such primes, it follows that $f^{(k)}(-1)=0$ for each $0\\le k< \\mu.$ But this means that $ (1+A)^{\\mu}$ divides $f(A).$\n\n\\[Kcor\\] If $L$ is as in the theorem, then the Kauffman Bracket $\\langle L(z+[2]) \\rangle \\in {{\\mathbb{Z}}}[A^{\\pm}]$ is also divisible by $(1+A)^{\\mu}$.\n\nThis follows immediately from the fact that $2-[2]=2-A^2-A^{-2}=(1-A^2)(1-A^{-2})$ is divisible by $1+A.$\n\n[*In a similar way, Theorem \\[tK\\] remains true if we replace $v$ with $\\hat v= (z+ [2])/(1+A)$ in the definition of $K(n).$ Similarly Theorems \\[secondbasis\\], \\[thg2\\], \\[thg3\\] remain true if we replace $v$ by $\\hat v.$* ]{}\n\n[*Theorem \\[th11\\] can also be proved by computing the Kauffman bracket from the (framed) Kontsevich integral via an appropriate weight system. Actually this proof is an adaptation of an argument going back to Kricker and Spence [@KS Proof of Thm. 2], but they only considered algebraically split links. Previously Ohtsuki [@OhCambridge Prop. 3.4] had obtained a stronger divisiblity result for $\\langle L(z+[2]) \\rangle$ using quantum groups, for algebraically split links satisfying some extra conditions. Later, Cochran and Melvin generalised the Kontsevich integral argument, and their result [@CM Theorem 2.5] contains Corollary \\[Kcor\\] for zero-framed links. (The results of [@OhCambridge; @KS; @CM] are stated in terms of the Jones polynomial, but it is well-known that the Jones polynomial and the Kauffman bracket are equivalent.) However, the restriction to zero framing is not really necessary (although a small additional argument is needed). We will not give details of this alternative proof here, as the techniques are completely different from the ones in the present paper.* ]{}\n\n[BHMV2]{}\n\nAsymptotic Faithfulness of the quantum $SU(n)$ representations of the mapping class groups. arXiv:math.QA/0204084 On framings of $3$-manifolds.
