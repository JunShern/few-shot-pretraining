    "text": "Review Sections\n\nFew brands have as firmly established a brand identity as the Lenovo ThinkPad (and the IBM ThinkPad before that). The iconic look and feel of these systems have changed in only subtle ways over the years, maintaining a road-tested list of features, from the solid, chunky keyboards to the jutting top lip of the display lid to the familiar red trackpoint and secondary mouse buttons.\n\nThe ThinkPad X machines are small, if not exactly svelte, versions of the bigger ThinkPads found in corporate offices around the world. The current version of the X201 maintains a surprisingly large keyboard, accomplished by literally running the keys to the very edges of the chassis, as well as a 12-inch display and Intel's latest Core i5 processor.\n\nIt's about as powerful an ultraportable package as you're likely to find (and a wholly different beast from the other small-but-mighty laptop we've seen recently, the Dell Alienware M11x), but it's also not nearly as portable as most 11- or 12-inch Netbook-style systems. We could see shaving a little mass off by ditching the trackpoint (which requires a large wrist rest to accommodate its double set of mouse buttons), but at the same time, we're happy to shoulder a little more weight in return for the semirugged feel and the peace of mind the construction provides.\n\nPrice as reviewed / Starting price\n\n$1,464 / $1,099\n\nProcessor\n\n2.53GHz Intel Core i5 M540\n\nMemory\n\n4GB, 1066MHz DDR2\n\nHard drive\n\n320GB 7,200rpm\n\nChipset\n\nIntel HM55\n\nGraphics\n\nIntel Media Accelerator HD (integrated)\n\nOperating System\n\nWindows 7 Home Premium (64-bit)\n\nDimensions (WD)\n\n11.6 x 10.1 inches\n\nHeight\n\n1.3 inches\n\nScreen size (diagonal)\n\n12.1 inches\n\nSystem weight / Weight with AC adapter\n\n3.8 / 4.5 pounds\n\nCategory\n\nUltraportable\n\nIf the Lenovo ThinkPad X201 looks familiar, that's exactly the point. Similar to the rest of Lenovo's ThinkPad line, and virtually identical to the last X-series ThinkPad we reviewed, there's a satisfying sameness to the micromanaged (in a good way) design details. Sure, there are occasional tweaks and improvements, but today's ThinkPad retains much of the design DNA of systems from years ago.\n\nInterestingly, however, Lenovo has started to seriously experiment with its standard look and feel, starting with the underrated consumer-targeted IdeaPad series. We've seen new colors, new keyboards, and an overall much flashier look from those systems, and some of those ideas have started to bleed over to the commercial side, with laptops such as the ThinkPad Edge.\n\nThis system, however, sticks to the traditional beats. Exactly where in the list of contenders it places is up to individual taste, but Lenovo's chunky tapered-key keyboards are in nearly everyone's top tier of laptop keyboards. The look is positively retro now, with many (including several Lenovo models) switching to flat-topped island-style keyboards. That said, this version of Lenovo's classic keyboard is a dream, with easy to hit keys, large versions of the Shift and other important keys, and absolutely zero flex, under even heavy typing. Our only complaint would be that on this smaller keyboard tray, the red trackpoint button seems bigger than ever, and we occasionally stumbled over it while typing.\n\nThe recessed touch pad has a slick, accurate surface and is easy to use, although it seems small compared with the generous keyboard, as if it had to be shrunk down to squeeze in the second row of mouse buttons above it.\n\nOne of the reasons ThinkPads are popular with big companies, small businesses, and individual consumers alike is the specialized suite of software and support apps that come with every system. Called ThinkVantage, and handily summoned by a dedicated blue button just above the keyboard, the ThinkVantage interface gives you one-stop access to security and diagnostic tools, plus Lenovo support features. It's a very useful tool, but at the same time, it may be our imagination, but there does seem to be more advertising for Lenovo accessories and services in ThinkVantage than we recall from previous versions.\n\nThe 12.1-inch wide-screen LCD display offers a 1,280x800-pixel native resolution, which is standard for many 13- and 14-inch laptops (12-inch models themselves are a relative rarity). It's essentially a 16:10 aspect ratio version of the 1,366x768-pixel displays seen on 16:9 laptops with wider screens.\n\nOne of the best reasons for a nonbusiness user to consider a biz-oriented system like this is Lenovo's matte displays--a nice change of pace from the overly glossy screens we usually see (or try to see, through the ever-present glare).\n\nLenovo ThinkPad X201\n\nAverage for category [ultraportable]\n\nVideo\n\nVGA out\n\nVGA plus HDMI or DisplayPort\n\nAudio\n\nStereo speakers, headphone/microphone jacks\n\nStereo speakers, headphone/microphone jacks\n\nData\n\n3 USB 2.0, SD card reader\n\n2 USB 2.0, SD card reader\n\nExpansion\n\nExpressCard/54\n\nNone\n\nNetworking\n\nEthernet, modem, 802.11n Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, optional mobile broadband\n\nEthernet, 802.11n Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, optional mobile broadband\n\nOptical drive\n\nNone\n\nNone, or DVD burner\n\nLenovo laptops are typically highly configurable, although they rarely offer much in the way of CPU or GPU choice. Instead, you get a variety of options for RAM, hard drives, networking, and even operating system. Even the ExpressCard slot, nearly extinct among consumer laptops, is here, offering some extra expansion flexibility, as well as an equally rare old-fashioned modem jack--both are more frequently found on business systems than on consumer ones.\n\nIntel's Core i5 CPU, in this case the 2.53GHz Intel Core i5 M540, continues to impress. Especially as it's packed into a 12-inch system (even if it's on the large side of 12-inch models). You're not going to find many laptops at this size that can pack in the same power as a mainstream 15-inch system; the only comparable ultraportable we can think of right now is Sony's Vaio Z116. The end result is a laptop that can handle just about any nongraphics-intensive chore you can throw at it.\n\nDan Ackerman leads CNET's coverage of laptops, desktops, and Windows tablets, while also writing about games, gadgets, and other topics.
