    "text": "From Awe to Awful and Back\n\n\u2014 Advocacy for Animals is pleased this week to publish this article by M. David Feld, who is cofounder and National Program Director of GeesePeace, an international nonprofit organization dedicated to devising nonlethal and environmentally sound solutions to problems created by the presence of geese and other wildlife in human communities.\n\nFrom Awe\n\nLoyalty, fidelity, cooperation, heroism, and sacrifice: the mother goose and gander mate for life. They will never abandon their goslings, even under intense pressure and threats to their lives. If the parent geese do fly off, it is only a strategic ploy to allow the goslings to escape by taking advantage of their speed, agility, and ability to hide in small places. The parent geese always return.\n\nIn the spring, migrating Canada geese in the Atlantic Flyway travel 1,000 or more miles to the Hudson Bay in Canada to nest in their birthplaces. It is a biological imperative that they cannot break, just as salmon must swim upstream to spawn. By April, most migrating geese are flying north. And then in October, they fly south before the northern water bodies freeze over. There are three other flyways in the United States for migratory birds like Canada geese: the Mississippi Flyway, the Central Flyway, and the Pacific Flyway.\n\nCanada geese fly in a V-formation. The lead goose in the formation reduces the air resistance for the rest and so expends more energy than the other birds. The geese change positions in the formation, taking turns at the lead so that all bear the burden of leadership. When a goose is injured or exhausted, its mate leaves the formation and stays with the injured or exhausted goose until it recovers or dies. On the migration south this may result in the mate\u2019s own death, because a single goose will not have the advantage of flying in formation to conserve energy and therefore may not reach the temperate areas before the water bodies freeze over.\n\nIn my hometown of Brooklyn, New York, migrating geese were the only noncaptive wildlife we ever saw. I remember waiting for the heralds of spring and winter each year: the sound of honking geese. Sometimes they flew low enough for me to hear the whoosh of their powerful wings as they passed overhead in magnificent V-formations, wave after wave. That was in 1956, the year the Brooklyn Dodgers finally won the World Series.\n\nTo Awful\n\nToday some Canada geese are staying all year in urban and suburban areas. They seem never to migrate, and each year there are more of them. Many people in these areas consider Canada geese to be a pest. They fear that geese droppings are harmful to humans and that geese make parks, playgrounds, and beaches unusable. They believe that geese are aggressive and noisy and are destroying their lawns,sparks, and golf courses. It is a fact that they have become a danger to aircraft.\n\nWhat happened? Why are the resident geese not joining their migratory cousins in Canada during the great migrations? Are they just too lazy? Do they stay for the abundant sweet, freshly clipped grass and fresh water we provide in our parks and golf courses? Understanding what happened is the first step toward becoming an advocate for the Canada geese living in our urban and suburban areas.\n\nToday\u2019s resident Canada geese are the descendants of migratory geese who were captured in the early 1900s. The flight feathers of these birds were clipped to keep them from escaping. Commercial hunters then used them as live decoys to increase their take of migratory geese. Because the captured geese were made flightless, their immediate offspring and later descendants never learned how to migrate (migratory behavior in geese is learned). Thus resident geese have no choice about whether or not to migrate\u2014they are biologically trapped in the human communities in which they live.\n\nSome resident geese in urban and suburban communities are descended from geese that were resident in rural areas. The rural geese came to the towns and suburbs because people began to feed them or because some of them learned that they were safer in human communities than in the wild. Their goslings then treated the town or suburb (or nearby islands or marshes) as their refuge.\n\nAfter decades of hunting using live decoys, the migratory geese flocks were nearly gone. In the 1930s, however, the practice of using live decoys was made illegal in the United States, punishable by large fines and prison sentences. Still, by the mid 1960s, U.S. federal and state wildlife managers had become so alarmed by the continued failure of the flocks to recover that they joined conservationist, sportsman, and water-fowl groups in an extraordinary effort to increase the Canada goose population through artificial incubation of eggs in hatcheries, the use of nesting tubs to reduce predation of the nests, and relocating geese to better and safer breeding grounds.\n\nBy 1990 this effort seemed to have been a great success, and wildlife managers were rightly proud of their accomplishment. Little did they know that the Canada goose would eventually be reviled as a \u201cpest\u201d species in some American communities. In some urban areas, where hunting is not an option (and for good reason), human residents have resorted to capturing geese and their goslings while they are flightless during the molting season (June and July) and killing them one by one by putting them in air-tight boxes which are then filled with carbon dioxide gas. This is not an acceptable way to treat innocent wildlife.\n\nAnd Back: The GeesePeace Approach\n\nAdvocacy is not just wishful thinking. It is a process that begins with knowledge, empathy, and leadership. It ends with communities resolving the wildlife conflict and being happy about the way they did so. To advocate for Canada geese one must first understand why the Canada goose is revered by many people as a symbol of wildlife appreciation and protection. (The Canada goose is still the symbol of the US Fish and Wildlife Services Refuge System.) Then one must understand why some of these same geese are now resident all year in urban and suburban areas and coming into conflict with people. Then one must find a respectful and humane solution to the community\u2019s problem. And then, finally, one must implement the solution in partnership with community leaders, people who wish to protect the geese, and people who find them a nuisance. This is the general approach developed by GeesePeace, a nonprofit organization that I cofounded in 1999 in my community of Lake Barcroft, Virginia, a lakeside suburb of Washington, DC.\n\nThe specific elements of the GeesePeace program include: stabilizing the resident-goose population by oiling or addling goose eggs, thereby preventing them from hatching (this practice also makes it easier to flush out parent geese and other adults from nesting areas, since there are no goslings to protect); establishing a \u201cgeese-exclusion zone\u201d by posting border collies on each body of water in an area where geese cannot be tolerated; enhancing the border collies\u2019 effectiveness by planting tall grasses or other high vegetation, which the geese perceive as a hiding place for land predators; using chemical repellants for short periods to prevent geese from feeding in particularly sensitive areas; and establishing a no-feeding program, which may include the use of colorful and attractive signage that people are more likely to read. Collies are not used during molting season and from mid-November to mid-March, when the weather is cold, and from mid-March to mid-May, when geese are nesting.\n\nThe GeesePeace solution will work in any community in which there are conflicts with urban wildlife. We simply take the \u201clethal option\u201d off the table and at the same time commit ourselves to solving the problem for everyone involved, including the geese. In an instant, the negative energy of controversy is converted into the positive energy of cooperation, as everyone works together toward the same goal.\n\nIn the 10 years since its founding, GeesePeace has become an organization of national and international scope. All GeesePeace programs are managed by local communities, some of which form partnerships to share resources and coordinate activities.\n\nIn addition to its program for dealing with resident Canada geese, GeesePeace has also developed strategies that address the presence of deer in suburban communities and the very important problem of bird strikes with aircraft.\n\nProtecting geese from extinction is everyones obligation and protecting geese from themselves and over population is an added reponsibility. As noted, we have brought many geese back from possible extinction to \u201cpest\u201d status. Collies and oiling eggs are partial options that are not working in all areas. Where they do, they certainly should be employed. Fish and Game have been extremly sucessful in returning turkeys, coyotes, black bears, deer and geese and hunting is no longer working for them in keeping excess populations under control for various reasons. A bow hunter told me this week in Warren County, NJ he now sees more black bears then deer and there is virtually no limit on the number of deer that can be taken. Emotionally protecting excess animal populations does not make sense. The Govenor of NJ stopped bear hunting two years ago and a dangerous bear-people confrontation is now in the making, same as geese and airplanes. Until otherwise developed and implemented, hunting and listening to State and Federal Fish and Game authorities is our and the animals best option. commonsenseforanimals.org\n\nactually, you are incorrect about Geese never abandoning their young offspring. I was heart broken and did the wrong thing in trying to bring 3 (5-day old) gosslings back to their mom on at least 6 occasions in two days. She only wanted 2 offspring and began abandoning three right away. I was able to capture the three and return them to her, but what I saw in the next two days was terrible and I\u2019m sorry I did not know more about what to do. I should have brought the ones she kept abandoning to a rehab center- but I didn\u2019t know how to. Three of her goslings died within three days and I found one of them today. THey were beaten up by other geese they tried to bond with when their mom left them alone. I saw this with my own eyes and like I said, am heart broken that I didn\u2019t figure out what to do sooner.\n\nThat is sad. You did the very best you could, though, according to what you thought was right.\n\nThere are a lot of wildlife rescue organizations that will help people deal with situations like this, so hopefully people reading this will learn from your sad experience. Thanks for trying, and thanks for helping increase awareness about the geese we might encounter in everyday life.\n\nWe have 4 geese families on our property this year. One of the pairs only had 1 gosling. Now we are seeing a gosling all by itself and I haven\u2019t seen the pair with the 1 gosling in a few days. The single gosling tries to join up with the other families but is chased off by an adult goose. Did the gosling\u2019s parents abandon it? Is there something we should be doing for it? It is eating and growing normally but we feel so bad that it\u2019s by itself. The other pairs have 8, 6, and 5 goslings so we have quite the crowd. We have a 4 acre pond and mow about 10 acres so they love it here.\n\nWe have a Bird Sanctuary which protects birds in the summer. Today we found 2 goslings wandering around, shivering and calling for their mamas. Whenever they tried to find an adult momma she would chase them away and peck at them. No mamma ever showed up. We watched this for more than an hr. Then made a decision to take them to a wildlife rescue. It\u2019s hard to know if one did the right thing. I feel that if \u201cmomma\u201d was interested, she would have turned up. I would not have been able to sleep the night, had we not stepped in.\n\nI advocate for Canada geese in an area of Massachusetts. I need your opinion, please. Many Canada geese have made a big city park their home for about 15 years. I love them. Some people harass them and I keep defending them, contact park authorities about it, but it\u2019s sometimes so heartbreaking to see the apathy to protect these amazing birds. I learned that park authorities want to use trained dogs to \u201crelocate\u201d the geese. How come can they do that if these geese don\u2019t have the ability to migrate because they are urban Canada geese?\nPlease, could you give me your opinion about this method to \u201crelocate\u201d the geese by making trained dogs to harass them for them supposedly to migrate? Is that possible? I\u2019m concerned for these birds I am so fond of. Thanks in advance for your opinion\n\nHi, Gonzalo,\nI found this information on the GeesePeace website. http://www.geesepeace.com/geesepeaceprogram/siteaversion.html They use border collies. Canada geese may not migrate, but that doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t move to a less contentious area if the dogs make it uncomfortable for them. It just means that they don\u2019t move seasonally from one place to another. Thanks for caring about the geese, by the way.\n\nI looked at this site because I was wondering under what conditions goose parents would abandon their offspring. Last summer I captured an approximately 2-month-old gosling after it had been attacked by a snapping turtle and one of its feet and legs had been severely mangled. I took it home, as my iintention was to take it to a wildlife rehab clinic with which I was already familiar, but it was over an hour away and past closing time. I planned a trip there for the next morning. So I put it in a large box with water in a dark, quiet area of my house, but it died in my arms the next morning. This has been bothering me since. I am haunted by wondering if it would have somehow survived if I\u2019d left it there at the pond, unable to walk, nearly unable to swim, and weeks away from flight. And why had it been abandoned by its family? I thought Canadian geese never abandoned their offspring."
