But if I have many files it is a problem to process like that.\nRemark: \nIn case if I need to save every minute - I can use Excel's autosave, but \nautosave is is in *.xlsb format which I have a problem reading by Python,\nalso several files are created and it is not clear what file is saved in what moment.\nAlso that would not work if I need to save every 10 seconds.\n\nA:\n\nTo save all open excel files every 10 seconds, you can use this code. You can assign it to shape and run it from one of the excel files.\nSub Save1()\nDim xWb As Workbook\nApplication.DisplayAlerts = False\nFor Each xWb In Application.Workbooks\n        If Not xWb.ReadOnly And Windows(xWb.Name).Visible Then\n            xWb.Save\n        End If\n    Next\nApplication.DisplayAlerts = True\n\nApplication.OnTime Now + TimeValue(\"00:00:10\"), \"Save1\"\nEnd Sub\n\n"
