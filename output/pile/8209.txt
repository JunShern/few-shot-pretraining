If interested, please view the first in the series: Marijuana Laws in Southeast Asia.\n\n_______________________________________________________________\n\nFrom an American kid hitting a bong while watching Harold and Kumar to a Moroccan enjoying hash with his afternoon tea, people all over the world smoke cannabis.\n\nDESPITE THE POPULARITY OF weed and hash, most governments in the world have deemed it harmful to the individual and society as a whole.\n\nThere are only 11 nations in the world where weed and hash have been decriminalized. A handful of countries impose mandatory prison sentences and other harsh punishments for the possession or sale of any form of weed and hash. Another handful look the other way when dealing with cannabis.\n\nSome places that are easy on weed heads can be broken up by region:\n\nLatin America\n\nIn Latin America, cannabis is tolerated and/or decriminalized in most countries, with the exception of Bolivia, Ecuador, Honduras and Guatemala. Marijuana grows well in Central and South America and is a large part of the economy.\n\nGovernments tend to have more to worry about than whether someone is smoking a joint. For travelers, this means that smoking in South America is probably okay, but caution should be used.\n\nOnly Peru considers cannabis to be a legal drug, provided you are not in possession of another drug. I get the impression that throughout Latin America, the tolerance doesn\u2019t typically extend to tourists, especially if the police can get a bribe out of it, but you should never travel with pot and risk being searched.\n\nI would highly recommend caution throughout Mexico, Panama, Guatemala and even Costa Rica. Although weed is sold to tourists all the time in quantities up to 1/4 pound, those buyers in turn, are often set up for the policia.\n\nIn this particular region, weed may be tolerated, decriminalized or even legal up to small amounts (usually about 20 grams), but as always, keep a low profile.\n\nPhoto by martin cleary\n\nHere\u2019s a quick break down:\n\nARGENTINA : Decriminalized for personal use in small amounts and for consumption only in private locations. Public consumption is generally accepted among the young adults and overlooked by police in the suburbs.\n\n: Decriminalized for personal use in small amounts and for consumption only in private locations.

It is legal to buy and smoke herb in the Netherlands, in amounts up to five grams per person per day. People regularly smoke in public parks and anywhere else they can find a bench and a view.\n\nIn the Netherlands, one notices that tourists (especially American tourists) go a little overboard and smoke their way into oblivion. The only caution I would take here is making sure you don\u2019t get duped at the coffee shops or robbed by opportunistic thugs.\n\nGERMANY and BELGIUM : decriminalized. This means that possessing a small amount is ok, but puffing in public and selling weed is not.\n\nand : decriminalized.

SCANDINVIAN COUNTRIES: laws are quite strict concerning weed and it is not advisable to get caught smoking\n\nPhoto by Shira Golding\n\nNorth Africa\n\nThe other region where weed is ok is North Africa. In Egypt, Tunisia, and Morocco, locals smoke hash, a fine alternative to alcohol and accepted in society. However, this societal norm does not necessarily apply to tourists.\n\nIn other words, locals may be puffing, but if the laws still consider what you are doing as illegal, a cop can still make money off you. I recommend smoking with friends only in this region.\n\nEGYPT : Illegal, but not strictly enforced, just don\u2019t smoke in public. Also, don\u2019t carry large quantities unless you\u2019d like to see the inside of an Egyptian jail.\n\n: Illegal, but not strictly enforced, just don\u2019t smoke in public.

Not recommended to smoke in public or to carry more than a few grams at a time\u2013whatever you can quickly swallow or throw away. Tourists are usually let off with fines, but technically can be jailed for 4-10 years. Even more if you\u2019re suspected of smuggling.\n\nHaving said all that, these are the nations in which cannabis is legal for consumption and where you should be able to smoke in peace:\n\nPhoto courtesy of author\n\nBELGIUM : Up to 5 grams.\n\n: Up to 5 grams.

AUSTRALIA: Up to 50grams! (Certain states of Australia have decriminalized marijuana possession. In Tasmania, Victoria and Queensland one can be simply ticketed for up to 50 grams. If found in possession with intent to supply, convictions apply)\n\nI use \u201cup to five grams\u201d because I like to err on the side of caution. I have smoked publicly with fishermen in Thailand, tea merchants in Egypt, farmers in SW China and all my homies throughout Europe and the US. I will continue to do so.\n\nPeople all over the planet understand the need to just relax and do your thing after a long day. Some do it with alcohol, some with tea, some with weed, and some with a book.\n\nStick to the nations numbered above and if you need to puff elsewhere, be careful.\n\nCommunity Connection\n\nHeaded to Amsterdam?
