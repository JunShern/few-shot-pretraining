This is my season to start happy dancing around because they did a bridge stretch higher than they did on the last practice or they started to use a wrestling move more efficiently than they did in their first week of wrestling. Whatever achievement my sons make, it\u2019s great to have Personal Best Pro app installed so I have notes right there, this is also a great app to assist me to reviewing my son\u2019s achievements at wrestling to tell their Dad.
