    "text": "I jumped on your map last night with three of the UCC guys just cuz we were on and there was four of us. We got sweaty- kind of doesn't count since those guys run circles around me (and I don't have any gameplay to show you either) but I do have some feedback for you if you want to make some tweaks before Monday's official test.\n\n\n\n2 things we all noticed and commented on:\n\n\n\n1- when you're looking top mid, especially from around the damage boost side of the map- really bad frame rate drop. From my own experience I know that even little pieces of glass and Windows can kill ur frames. It's really distracting when you are fighting someone in top mid from that side. I know you have worked hard to create your aesthetic but if you put some time into simplifying the top middle tower I think it would go a really long way towards gameplay.\n\n\n\n2- there are a number of little places on the map where you can fall and die that are super frustrating. I'm all for the boundaries of the map being death-falls and I'm all for a well labeled death pit or two but there were a couple areas where you would miss a jump and die and the only way to know that was to miss the jump. Considering how narrow the paths are already I would put some floors in there. If I am in a battle and I push in to clean up and I fall down to some lower level where I cannot finish my kill or help my teammate until I can find my way back up THAT is punishment enough- I think. The map encourages a lot of level changes and jumps and crazy **** so I just think you should let people jump around on the interior of the map without the fear of dying.\n\n\n\n3- I would have to show you were but there is a kill volume that overlaps a ramp just a little. My dude ripped my face and then crouched in a ramp to get shields and just died! I got a trade out of it haha.\n\n\n\nOk positives:\n\n\n\nFighting in and out of and around teleporter is ****ing beautiful.\n\n\n\nThere are some great areas right off spawn where you can lay shots on all the upper levels without over exposing yourself- but it's tough to finish kills on your own and that dynamic makes it lovely for 2v2.\n\n\n\nThe gameplay is great imo just need to keep fine tuning. I thought fuel rod was brilliant esp compared to rocks. Was devastating with damage boost and that will lead to some sick meta of losing the battle for fuel rod and then needing to rally so they don't also get damage boost.\n\n\n\nOver all I think it's still a tad busy. I think there is a fair amount of detail that is not necessary to sell your aesthetic. Everyone was really impressed with how the map looked so you have no worries there. It might be time to be a little less precious with your baby and just give it a buzz cut.\n\nRead More ..."
