    "text": "I listened to a fascinating program last night about Julian Rotter who is an eminent Clinical Psychologist. He wrote and studied a great deal about what he termed \u2018The Locus of Control\u2019 and posited that it was either Internal or External.\n\nAn Internal Locus of Control means you are taking responsibility for the fact that you have an influence over everything in your life, and External Locus of Control means that things happen to you which you can\u2019t control.\n\nIn NLP we call this the \u2018Cause and Effect\u2019 equation.\n\nThe problem with being at the Effect side is that you are not in control of things, you become a victim to life. Now I realise that shit happens! Of course I do\u2026 bad things have happened to me too \u2013 here\u2019s an example:\n\nMy Business Was Insolvent 3 Years Ago.\n\n\u2018Effect\u2019 thinking says:\n\nWhen I bought the business I was conned and paid too much\n\nWhen the person I bought off left they told me nothing about how to run a business\n\nThere is a recession on\n\nI can\u2019t find the staff nowadays\n\n\u2018Cause\u2019 thinking says:\n\nWhen I bought the business I didn\u2019t do enough research, so next time I am going to ensure that I research all investments thoroughly\n\nWhen I bought the business I didn\u2019t ask the right questions, so next time I will ensure that I am curious and I\u2019ll seek the advice of professionals\n\nPeople are not prepared to spend money, so what can I do to change my \u2018offering\u2019 and my marketing to be relevant for the times\n\nThe right people for my business are out there, so how can I communicate better so that I find them\n\n(FYI \u2013 this business is now back doing exceptionally well!)\n\nBeing at \u2018Cause\u2019 does not mean that you blame yourself for things, it means you accept that you have had an effect, no matter how tiny, on everything that happens. This is a VERY empowering thing to think and believe.\n\n\u201cWhat am I learning NOW about how I might do things BETTER and differently in the future?\u201d\n\nListen to the program on BBC iPlayer, it\u2019ll open your eyes to the power of controlling your mind and why we all need to think differently. The only thing the program doesn\u2019t talk about is how to change\u2026 and that\u2019s where NLP comes in!
