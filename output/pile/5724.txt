    "text": "Are you looking to hire for certain positions right now?\n\nHello! Who are you and what business did you start?\n\nMy name is Robert Morris. I founded TerrAvion in 2013 together with Cornell Wright.\n\nTerrAvion is an image delivery service for agriculture. Our core service is called OverView, which delivers subscription imagery, overnight, throughout the growing season. The images allow growers to have a real up-to-date picture of all of their fields as well as synthetic maps and analysis.\n\nOur service works by TerrAvion contracting with flight providers, flying small planes, to operate a sensor that TerrAvion designs and integrates. TerrAvion plans and monitors the routes to ensure quality delivery. Our company\u2019s technology is mostly around how to manage and process millions of acres a day, overnight, at a very low cost. We deliver our service first and foremost through our API (application programming interface\u2013an endpoint for computers to talk to each other). Our web and mobile software, as well as partner software, call this API to deliver maps and images to the client.\n\nWe view our job as abstracting away all the complexity and delivering maps that are ready to use so that growers can spend more time applying their expertise, more powerfully, and over a larger area. Below is a screenshot of our interface with fields shown in our vigor image data layers.\n\nWhat's your backstory and how did you come up with the idea?\n\nI have always had a great interest in robotics. As a former U.S. Army officer, I led the first RQ-7B \"Shadow\" drone platoon in Afghanistan. After the Army, I consulted for Deloitte Consulting, where I organized the U.S. Navy's first Unmanned Surface Vehicle Community of Interest. One day I was talking to a friend who mentioned that agriculture could not see what was going on in the field as the only vision came from satellite data.\n\nWe even out-executed a competitor that Steve Blank was personally advising, by actually following his advice.\n\nSatellite data has vast limitations amongst others due to the lack of data resolution and timeliness. Based on my experience, I realized that drones were not the solution either, so I looked into fixed-wing aircraft as a possibility to capture image data and making the field visible for farmers.\n\nTake us through the process of designing, prototyping, and manufacturing your first product and describe the process of launching the business.\n\nCornell (TerrAvion\u2019s technical co-founder) and I spent months researching the market and had a hypothesis about the product and business model that the agriculture industry required. We took a powerpoint to the big trade show we were targeting and got people to agree that if we could build the system, they would sign up for the service.\n\nCornell and I borrowed the equipment to do a validation flight from a supplier called Uniforce (still around today) and rented a plane from a retired Air Force Colonel to collect some data. We proved that the system *could* work with an engineer hovering over it, and with that signed our first customers in 2013. The system was a Frankenstein of off the shelf imaging and positioning technologies, driven by Linux computer, running the code that allowed us to get enough data to take pictures and turn them into high-quality maps that measured chlorophyll density, transpiration, and made awesome color maps--similar to Google. It is not common knowledge, but that highest zoom level on Google or Bing is actually captured by aircraft, even though they call it \u201cSatellite\u201d for marketing purposes. Our system was similar to Google or Bing aerial system but allowed us to see extra data bands that are important to agriculture and process the data overnight instead of several months.\n\nSince then, we\u2019ve been scaling the business to get it to the point where it is a sustainable and rapidly growing \u201cpixel utility.\u201d Now all of our flights are pilot solo flights and take place on two continents almost every day of the year.\n\nSince launch, what has worked to attract and retain customers?\n\nThe best thing for us has been to work with partners. Many people, especially when we were starting, had this idea that they were going to build the be-all and end-all piece of ag software, sold directly, and they would disrupt the current ag system. This is not our approach.\n\nOur approach has been to recognize that we are quite literally the best in the world at one thing: collecting ag imagery efficiently, reliably, and at scale. Then there are APIs and apps to make any fantasy anyone has about using imagery a reality.\n\nOur attitude of sticking to the one thing we do best, invest in it, improve it, and widen our lead over everyone in the space has given us unprecedented access to the agricultural distribution channel. We work with most of the major ag retailers, 100+ smaller distributors, and all of the multi-national ag input majors. This is a beginning, and we have a long way to go, but working with and helping the people who are currently in the system has been tremendously beneficial to us.\n\nHow are you doing today and what does the future look like?\n\nWe are nearly profitable in 2019 and are forecasting being \u201cAmazon profitable\u201d or sustained reinvestment in growth from operating activities in 2020. This is important because we are fundamentally a utility for collecting pictures and maps, on which other people and organizations build. It is driven by the continued growth of our partner sales, especially input, ag retail, and analytics partners. We had to sell direct to growers to get started, but we\u2019re less than 2% direct now--and basically only sell direct where we\u2019re trying to embarrass our channel partners into better behavior.\n\nBoth in 2020 and the long term, we are embarking on a path to make our infrastructure more open and fill out a team that can support our partners from the farm to corporate HQ or the global R&D center. This open infrastructure is going to be amazing because it will allow high-end computing on the edge with better and better sensors (some of which we are already flying) so our partners will be able to do more and more unique things.\n\nThrough starting the business, have you learned anything particularly helpful or advantageous?\n\nI learned about sales, sales, and sales. I wish I had known more, it is a weird and tough discipline. Seductively simple, but actually harder to manage than most of the black and white engineering, product, operations complexity, because there is so little control by management over a sales team and a sales team over their customers, people are hard to predict, but people are the only thing that matters.\n\nYou will never be having more fun than when you control your own destiny and have the freedom that you have starting out.\n\nBeyond platitudes, somebody who has actually set-up a sales process (not run, not worked in, set-up) is key or you have to figure out how to do this the hard way, which you can do, but it takes a long time and time is the enemy of start-ups.\n\nWe even out-executed a competitor that Steve Blank was personally advising, by actually following his advice.\n\nWe run our operations on essentially 100% custom-built software on common open source tools in the public cloud. Our customer-facing side has centered on Hubspot as a total external communication backbone, one of the best decisions we\u2019ve made recently.\n\nAlso, not discussed enough, but working with a PEO has allowed us to field a team where our customers live and work and be able to offer benefits.\n\nWhat have been the most influential books, podcasts, or other resources?\n\nI\u2019m a big fan of the books. As an operations-focused company in a new market, The Goal and Clayton Christensen\u2019s Innovator\u2019s series have been particularly informative to our thinking. Also a big fan of Steve Blank\u2019s Four Steps to the Epiphany.\n\nThe Goal, the only Socratic business novel I\u2019ve ever heard of, helps you figure out what\u2019s actually holding you back, there\u2019s often a tendency to work on what you got good at fixing, not what\u2019s actually holding you back, note this different from what I was saying about company focus above.\n\nChristensen\u2019s books deal with figuring out the game theory of your product, it is a shockingly accurate description and uncanny in its predictive power about the behavior of competitors.\n\nFinally, Steve Blank talks about what you need to do at each stage of the company building, his books are so good we even out-executed a competitor that he was personally advising, by actually following his advice.\n\nAdvice for other entrepreneurs who want to get started or are just starting out?\n\nMy biggest advice is to not raise money if you can do without. I\u2019d even consider changing ideas or markets until you can find a business you can bootstrap. You will never be having more fun than when you control your own destiny and have the freedom that you have starting out.\n\nAlso, we thought we could bootstrap TerrAvion--we were wrong about that--but having the discipline to even try has made us a much better and stronger company. Ultimately, all businesses must work on a cash basis--the earlier you can get started on that, the stronger position you\u2019ll be in and the more control and less stress you\u2019ll have.\n\nAre you looking to hire for certain positions right now?\n\nWe are currently hiring for several full-time positions, including for an Accountant, Customer Support Team Leader, Operations, District Sales/Territory Managers.\n\nWhere can we go to learn more?\n\nIf you have any questions or comments, drop a comment below!\n\nWant to start your own business?\n\nHey! \ud83d\udc4bI'm Pat Walls, the founder of Starter Story.
