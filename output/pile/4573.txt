    "text": "1. Field of the Invention\nThe present invention relates to a support frame and, more particularly, to a support frame that is stably installed on a ground where it is difficult to maintain balance such as an uneven ground or a slope.\n2. Description of the Related Art\nFor example, according to the support frames for beach umbrellas that are used at present, weight is ensured at the lower end by cement or a casting (cast iron), a support of the beach umbrella is coupled to the center to support the support frame, a support side is stuck in the ground, and the support of the beach umbrella is placed thereon.\nThe existing support frames should be used for their use environments and functions and users have to purchase those support frames having different functions. Further, a weight type of support frame is difficult to carry and support frames that are designed to be stuck in a support floor can be used only on the ground and the like, where support pins can be stuck.\nThat is, the existing support frames are designed to support beach umbrellas that are supported at the center, so they are not enough for supporting a beach umbrella or an object of which the center of gravity is inclined.\nFurther, legs of the present invention can be moved and fixed at 180 degrees in a tripod shape to be available for a support frame having a tripod-shaped support such as the tripod for a camera.\nAccordingly, the present invention provides a support frame that can support an object regardless of the ground such as a flat ground, an uneven ground, a slope, asphalt, or cement and that can support a beach umbrella of which the center of gravity is inclined, a support frame that is stuck in the ground, and an object supported in a tripod-shaped support such as the tripod for a camera."
