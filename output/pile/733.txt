    "text": "Forum for European Philosophy\n\nThe Forum is an educational charity which organises and runs a full and varied programme of philosophy and interdisciplinary events in the UK. Our events take various forms but we studiously avoid academic papers. Formats we like include dialogues, panel discussions, public lectures and provocations, all of which are open to the public and most of which are free.\n\nChair: Geoffrey Hawthorn, Emeritus Professor of International Politics and Emeritus Fellow, Clare Hall, University of Cambridge\n\nIs politics the instrument of moral ideals and values? Is it something like \u2018applied morality\u2019? In recent years there has been a revival of approaches which give greater autonomy to distinctively political thought, which can be called \u2018political realism\u2019, in contrast to \u2018political moralism\u2019. The panel discussion will explore this contrast, and ask whether political legitimacy is ultimately a question of one's moral conception.\n\nDominic Johnson, Alastair Buchan Professor of International Relations, University of Oxford\n\nRyan McKay, Reader in Psychology, Royal Holloway, University of London\n\nChair: Tali Sharot, Director of the Affective Brain Lab and Reader in the Department of Experimental Psychology, UCL and Forum for European Philosophy Fellow\n\nThe human mind produces countless biases, illusions and predictable errors. Are such false beliefs adaptive? Had they evolved for a reason? From overconfidence to the illusion of control, the speakers will argue that false beliefs can provide the individual with an advantage in domains ranging from war and politics to health and finance. But how do such beliefs affect us as a society?\n\nThe Good Life\n\nMonday 11 May, 6.30 \u2013 8pm\nWolfson Theatre, New Academic Building, LSE\n\nAmber Carpenter, Associate Professor of Philosophy, Yale-NUS College and Senior Lecturer in Philosophy, University of York\n\nJosh Cohen, Professor of Modern Literary Theory at Goldsmiths, University of London and a practising psychoanalyst\n\nChair: Danielle Sands, Lecturer in Philosophy, Royal Holloway, University of London and Forum for European Philosophy Fellow\n\nWhat makes a life good? Is the \u2018good life\u2019 a happy life? Does the \u2018good life\u2019 name an individual experience or a social goal? In what ways have alterations in our perception of the human changed the notion of human flourishing? In this event, three thinkers will address the meaning and significance of the \u2018good life\u2019 today.\n\nThe Enlightenment philosopher David Hume tells us that \u2018a wise man proportions his belief to his evidence.\u2019 And according to W.K. Clifford, \u2018it is wrong always, everywhere, and for anyone to believe anything on insufficient evidence\u2019. But is believing without evidence really wrong, and if so what are we to make of religious beliefs? To answer these questions, we will bring together an epistemologist and a philosopher of religion.\n\nRecent events have provoked a public debate about the right to free speech. In a continuation of this debate, we will bring together philosophers and campaigners to examine the philosophical underpinnings of free speech, and how recent events should affect our thinking about it.\n\n\u2018The fate of our times is characterised by rationalisation and intellectualisation and, above all, by the \u201cdisenchantment of the world\u201d\u2019, declared Max Weber in 1917. These themes have occupied Akeel Bilgrami over many years, and his reflections on them have now been brought together in a collection of essays, Secularism, Identity, and Enchantment. In a change to the original programme, Bilgrami will be with us to discuss his work, alongside Max De-Gaynesfordand Joanna Hodge.\n\nChair: Danielle Sands, Lecturer in Philosophy, Royal Holloway, University of London and Forum for European Philosophy Fellow\n\nAre humans exceptional among living beings? How should we understand our relationship with the natural world? Current ecological crises have led to new conceptions of this relationship, increased focus on human responsibilities, and changing environmental practices. In this panel, two speakers will address both the theoretical questions raised by these issues and assess some of the practical responses which have been advanced.\n\nIn the wake of the fifth IPCC Report, we know that tackling climate change is crucial for human well-being. So why has the international community been faltering on effective climate action? What prospects are there for improvement at the forthcoming Paris conference? And how should we frame responsibilities and opportunities so as to break through the collective-action impasse? This panel discussion will draw on expertise from philosophy, political science and climate policy.\n\nMind sharing, crowdsourcing, online ratings \u2013 in our modern world we are constantly exposed to the opinion of the group. We are told that crowds are wise (\u2018Two heads are better than one\u2019 Ecclesiastes 4:9-12) and are cautioned against the madness of the mobs (\u2018Too many cooks spoil the broth\u2019). When is the crowd wise and when is it prone to madness?\n\nUse of this website is subject to, and implies acceptance of, its Terms of use (including Copyright and intellectual property, Privacy and data protection and Accessibility).
