\"Welcome to beautiful downtown Las Vegas.\" \"How many people are here from the orient?\" \"Raise your hands.\" \"You, sir...\" \"Where you from?\" \"No, wait, wait...\" \"Don't tell me.\" \"I'm sensing, you must have soul.\" \"You're a soul man.\" \"Why don't you share with everyone where you're from?\" \" Korea.\" \" How about that, folks?\" \"May I assume that this charming young lady is your daughter?\" \" She's my wife!\" \"Well, of course she is!\" \"and what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.\" \" What's your name?\" \" Yhun-Kihong.\" \"Yhun-Kihong.\" \"Would you be kind enough to join me up on the stage please?\" \"Are you serious about this guy?\" \"This a joke?\" \"You want me to round up some mimes and clowns while we're at it?\" \"Yhun-Kihong.\" \"What if I told you that that pretty necklace your wearing has a broken catch and on my count of three, will fall into your drink.\" \"Wouldn't that be something?\" \"Wouldn't that just blow your mind?\" \" Yeah.\" \" Yes.\" \"Wouldn't it blow all your minds!\" \"Three, two, one now.\" \"Did somebody say \"spooky\"?\" \"Wait a minute, look at your glass.\" \"Where did it go?\" \"Yhun-Kihong, why don't you look inside my pocket?\" \"Reach in.\" \"Dig deep.\" \"Let's have a big hand for Yhun-Kihong.\" \"Well, that's magic folks.\" \"And that's why I'm here.\" \"You've probably seen a lot of those shows.\" \"Mentalists, magicians, illusionists...\" \"You'll be shocked to know that sometimes not often, but sometimes, it's the real deal.\" \"Masquerading is an act hiding behind a few 50 dollar tricks hiding in a plain sight.\" \"Because if the magician doesn't do that the alternative is impossible for others to live with.\" \"Anyway.\" \"Wednesday night at The Back Page doesn't pay very well.\" \"So I gamble.\" \"But I don't play against other people, only against the house.\" \"So, no mega jack pots, no wash outs.\" \"The idea is to go unnoticed.\" \"That way I can keep coming back.\" \"I'm not a god.\" \"I can't see everyone's future, only my own.\" \"And only within 2 minutes except for when I saw her.\" \"But we'll come back to that.\" \"There's no pattern to this guy, he is all over the map.\" \"Well he's not counting, not enough to top of a 5 deck shoe.\" \"Wait a minute.\" \"Isn't that, that two bit magic act over at The Back Page?\" \" What's his name?\" \" Cadillac.\" \"Yeah, it's Frank Cadillac.\" \"Is he pulling tricks on us?\" \"Is that legal?\" \"He can't trick the deck.\" \"I'm telling you.\" \"That little prick knows what's coming.\" \"If he's really knocking a system why's he not betting more.\" \"That's gonna be my second question.\" \"Look at that.\" \"He's looking right at us.\" \"It's like he can hear us.\" \" What table was that?\" \" 27.\" \"It's Roybal, give me two men to table 27!\" \"Coming right now!\" \"Place your bets please.\" \"Here's the thing about the future.\" \"Every time you look at it it changes.\" \"Because you looked at it and that, changes everything else.\" \"Nine thousand and seventy.\" \"Empty the drawer.\" \"Move!\" \"Drop the gun, now!\" \"Nine thousand and seventy.\" \"Drop the gun.\" \"Step back.\" \"It's his gun.\" \"He's was gonna shoot 2 people.\" \"Step back, we'll settle this right now.\" \" Hey!\" \" What's he doing?\" \"Secure the doors, elevators, escalators.\" \"Every way out of this damn place, now!\" \"Clayman, seal off the Black Jack tables!\" \"Sullivan, link up with Roybal!\" \" We're on the floor, on the floor right now!\" \" Bring the view of the cameras!\" \"That way!\" \"This way!\" \"He's right next to you.\" \"10 dollar slots.\" \"Aisle 14.\" \"There he is behind you!\" \"Your left!\" \"Turn around!\" \"He's right between you.\" \"He's in the mens room, near the gift shop.\" \"Gift shop!\" \"Gift shop!\" \"Davis, where the hell is he?\" \"Black t-shirt, straw hat.\" \"Heading towards the entrance.\" \"Come on, let's go.\" \"Call Vegas PD.\" \"He just stole a silver Charger, tag 585-G4S.\" \" Drop the gun.\" \"Step back.\" \" It's his gun.\" \"He rose to the top of our gambling fraud wish list about 2 months ago.\" \"And what he does has nothing to do with luck.\" \"It's defilable ability.\" \"Look at him.\" \"He knows exactly what to do and not get caught.\" \"Can you explain that to me?\" \"No, I can't explain it, Callie.\" \"Nor do I have the time.\" \"The Russian Federation has a 10 kiloton nuclear munition, unaccounted for...\" \" I understand that.\" \" I'm not sure you do.\" \"We need every agent available beating the street.\" \"That bomb was stolen 5 weeks ago.\" \"We have just been informed of it now.\" \"Which means it could be parked under this truck for all we know.\" \"I need actionable intelligence.\" \"Not paranormals and bullshit magicians.\" \"With all due respect sir, this bullshit magician shown a pattern of advanced awareness, that is statistically impossible.\" \"But you let me bring him in, you'll get what you want.\" \"5 days, Callie.\" \"That's it.\" \"Get me the head of casino security.\" \" You Roybal?\" \" It's Roybal.\" \" Whatever.\" \" Who are you?\" \"Cavanaugh, take a walk.\" \"Hey, Roybal.\" \"This isn't a pissing contest.\" \"Come on.\" \"What did you do?\" \"You got a new car?\" \" Stole it.\" \" Oh, look at this.\" \"20 minutes to walk 20 steps.\" \"Well, that's what you get from two packs a day.\" \"I got you two sandwiches.\" \"Two sandwiches?\" \"Oh, that's plenty grand.\" \"Come on, take it.\" \"I love you.\" \"Oh, Jesus.\" \"How can I repay you?\" \"Must be a bitch to park this thing.\" \"Chief Roybal, Special Agent Ferris.\" \"I'm sure Agent Cavanaugh has explained to you that everything you say in this room, and you know we admit can be used against you.\" \"Do we understand each other?\" \"Sure.\" \" Tell me about Cris Johnson.\" \" I don't know who that is.\" \"How about Frank Cadillac?\" \"You chased him out your casino tonight.\" \" Stole a car from valet parking.\" \" Yeah, yeah, yeah I know Cadillac.\" \"I thought he was cheating us at cards, the next thing I know he's tackling some guy and waving a gun.\" \" Well, the gun wasn't his.\" \"The man he tackled was one of the two casino killings in Reno.\" \"He is in custody now.\" \"Come on, I'll show you something.\" \"You remember this?\" \"Oh yeah, of course I do.\" \"We were saying he's looking right at us.\" \" Hey, how did you get this?\" \" Now think carefully.\" \"What were you talking about right when he looked up?\" \"We were saying if he has a system why wasn't he betting more.\" \"You sure you weren't doing or saying anything else?\" \"Just going down to pick him up, I was urging for my radio...\" \"And right then?\" \"That's when he looked up?\" \"Be very specific.\" \"That's what I said.\" \"He looked up.\" \"Really.\" \"So he doesn't have to be there to do it.\" \"Once you entered his consciousness he can pick it up.\" \"Is that to work a system?\" \"Thank you.\" \"We're finished.\" \"Done some good here, Mr Roybal.\" \"But none of it is up for the discussion.\" \"As far as your concerned Cris Johnson never existed.\" \"That's going to be difficult, considering a hundred cameras saw him at the casino.\" \"Not to worry.\" \"Those tapes have been destroyed.\" \"Hey!\" \"Is she single?\" \"Cris, you can't keep stealing cars and having people chase you that's not a life.\" \"But you gotta forget this girl that you keep seeing in your head.\" \"No, I'm not going anywhere until I meet her.\" \"Well suppose she don't show up?\" \"She already did.\" \"At the diner.\" \"9 minutes after 8.\" \"Well, you've got a couple of hours.\" \"How about a game of pool?\" \"Allright, Irv.\" \"We'll shoot some pool.\" \"We timed every hand of Black Jack.\" \"The longest was 89 seconds when Jonhson pulled a 6 cards 21.\" \"So we know he can see at least a minute and a half ahead.\" \"I had our techs run a radio frequency spectrum analysis.\" \"Came up dry.\" \"He is not receiving any form of electronic help.\" \"At one point there was a 2 minute 16 second delay.\" \"He never bet.\" \"Just got up and walked away.\" \"Maybe 2.16 is too long.\" \"He can't see that far.\" \"Narrows our window a little bit any way.\" \"Got him.\" \"Vegas PD got a lo-jack hit on the stolen vehicle.\" \"Listen.\" \"About that girl.\" \"When you looked at the clock, did you happen to see a calendar?\" \"Because it could be 10 years from now she gets hungry.\" \"It's gotta be soon.\" \"I never seen further ahead than two minutes.\" \"Except for her.\" \"And what do you think the reason is that?\" \"I don't know.\" \"Maybe she doesn't scare easy.\" \"Maybe she's the one.\" \"Well, when you get like this there's no talking to you.\" \" She's almost here.\" \" What happened to the diner?\" \"Somebody else.\" \"A cop.\" \"A cop?\" \"Well, then you gotta go.\" \"No, I wanna see how much she knows, what she wants from me.\" \"Cris Johnson.\" \"Still here huh?\" \"Where else would I be?\" \"Special Agent Ferris.\" \"Next time steal a car without lo-jack.\" \"Can we speak privately?\" \"It's okay, Irv.\" \"Go ahead.\" \"Thanks.\" \"I'm sure you know why I'm here.\" \"Cause you're the man who knows what I'm going to do before I do it.\" \"Right?\" \"Oh, the show, right.\" \"Right!\" \"I saw you there.\" \" Wonderful.\" \"You like magic tricks?\" \" Yeah, yeah I do.\" \"Like your magic tricks, clairvoyance.\" \"Whatever you're calling it.\" \"Let's talk something hard.\" \"A stolen nucleur munition has being smuggled into the United States, or may in fact already be here.\" \"I want you to look ahead and tell me where it's gonna be deployed.\" \"I think you got the wrong guy.\" \"It's a magic act.\" \"You gonna stick with that story.\" \"Cause millions of lives are at risk and you could maybe prevent a major catastrophe.\" \"On a practical note.\" \"We are standing in front of a stolen vehicle and you are wanted for assault involving a weapon at the casino.\" \"Alright, that was an accident.\" \"He had a gun and he was going to shoot two people...\" \"Yeah?\" \"How did you know that?\" \"No good deed goes unpunished, does it?\" \"I can fix your legal problems buddy but you gotta step up otherwise your next magic show is gonna be in Fulsom State Prison.\" \"It's ironic but people like you who try to help had been torturing me.\" \"In the full sense of the word since I was 3 years old.\" \"What do they call it?\" \"Oh, yeah.\" \"Observed play therapy.\" \"Featuring the marathon 36 hours \"can you guess the next flash card\" game.\" \"So, please leave me alone and let me live some semblence of a normal life.\" \"I love to indulge your feelings.\" \"But I am dealing with a slightly larger picture right now.\" \"Now you can exercise your responsibility to help your fellow man or I will exercise that responsibility for you.\" \"You're right, I gotta go.\" \"He's gone, right?\" \"I missed him by seconds tonight.\" \"Excuse me honey, can you get off my car?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Thank you.\" \"Jesus.\" \" Mr Roybal?\" \" It's Roybal.\" \"Can I help you man?\" \"I have a few questions if this is a good time?\" \"Gaming Commission?\" \"It's after hours.\" \"You guys should be in a strip club right?\" \"Come on.\" \"What can you tell us about Cris Johnson?\" \"I don't know who you're talking about.\" \"Let me rephrase the question.\" \" Here you go, hon.\" \" Thanks.\" \"Excuse me.\" \"Hello.\" \"I noticed you're alone too.\" \"Do you mind if I join you?\" \"Actually I do.\" \"Sorry to bother you but I have a question about the coffee the bean they use...\" \"Isn't that something you should probably ask your waitress?\" \"Yes, it is.\" \"Excuse me, do you have a light?\" \"I don't smoke.\" \" Here you go, hon.\" \" Thanks.\" \"Please.\" \"Don't.\" \" Hi, Liz.\" \" Did you follow me here Kendal?\" \"No, no.\" \"I just thought we could talk.\" \"You know we got really nothing to talk about.\" \"And I told you that 3 weeks ago.\" \"Liz, come on.\" \"I had an off day, just give me another shot.\" \"It's not gonna happen, okay?\" \"So maybe you should just go.\" \"Do you know how hard it was to find you?\" \"I was at your apartment I tried the Starbucks on Lexington, I was at the dry cleaner...\" \"All I'm asking for is a few minutes of your time, so that we can work things out!\" \"Okay, Jesus!\" \"You're stalking me now.\" \"Don't!\" \"Don't say that, please.\" \"That's a terrible thing to say to somebody...\" \"Let go of me, Kendal.\" \"Look, I just...\" \"I thought we can talk.\" \"You know, maybe we can take a drive and now your ruining it.\" \"You're hurting me.\" \"Kendal?\" \"I think you're having another off day.\" \" Who the hell are you?\" \" I'm her future.\" \"Really?\" \"Hi, my name's Cris.\" \"You okay, Kendal?\" \"See, the thing is I feel connected to you and I don't know the reason why.\" \"Now listen.\" \"I think it's only fair that you pay for the lady's breakfast.\" \"What are you having?\" \"Pecan pies are amazing.\" \"Excuse me.\" \"I can pay for my own breakfast.\" \"You know what?\" \"You two work things out.\" \"You're hurting me.\" \"Kendal?\" \"I think you're having another off day.\" \" Who the hell are you?\" \" I'm her future.\" \"Really?\" \"Incoming.\" \" God damn it, Kendal!\" \" What?\" \"Don't blame me.\" \"This is your fault.\" \"Get out of here!\" \"Will somebody please call the cops?\" \"I am so sorry.\" \"Are you okay?\" \"Let me help you.\" \"Come on, lets get you cleaned up.\" \"Come on.\" \"Okay.\" \" I'm seeing some stars.\" \" Yeah?\" \"I'm Liz.\" \"Cris.\" \"You must have a death wish getting involved in that.\" \" Here.\" \"Just...\" \" Okay.\" \"Okay.\" \"Hold it there.\" \" For a bit.\" \" Okay.\" \" It will.\" \" What will?\" \"Your luck.\" \"It's gonna change.\" \"What are you?\" \"A leprechaun?\" \"Do leprachaun's get punched in the face or have their car stolen?\" \" Your car was stolen?\" \" Yeah.\" \"I'm hoping they find it today.\" \"Supposed to be in Flagstaff.\" \"Hey, is this tooth loose here?\" \"I don't know.\" \"I don't think so.\" \"It hurts.\" \"Well listen, maybe I can give you a ride.\" \" I'm kind of going that way.\" \" That would really be helpful, Liz.\" \"Thank you.\" \" I do have to make a stop though.\" \" It's okay.\" \"And it may take a few hours, so cool with that?\" \"Hey, look.\" \"If you're uncomfortable with this, I'll take a bus.\" \"No, no, no.\" \"Its fine, its fine.\" \"You're not a psycho.\" \"Right?\" \"Because the first psycho vibe i get, you're out of the car.\" \" Okay.\" \"Yes Ma'am.\" \" OK.\" \"Deal.\" \"Deal.\" \"It's amazing.\" \"Wasn't it?\" \"I end up in a diner where you are, both heading in the same direction.\" \"I don't know if I would call it amazing, but...\" \"Destiny.\" \"That's what it really is.\" \"Okay.\" \"I'm starting to get that psycho vibe.\" \"Ah, no...\" \"You don't believe in destiny?\" \"Well, even if it does exist, I don't think I want to know.\" \"I mean if every move we make is pre-ordained and what is the point of that?\" \"In life is supposed to be a surprise.\" \"Isn't it?\" \"It would be nice.\" \"Yeah.\" \"So he came in twice a day for a week at exactly 9 past 8?\" \"Yeah, he'd stay a few minutes, have a martini and then he'd go.\" \"Until today when he met that lady.\" \"Didn't find anything strange about that?\" \"Not strange enough to call the police.\" \"We got a regular that counts the cornflakes in his bowl it has to be an even number.\" \" Got any cameras?\" \" Inside?\" \"No.\" \"Outside?\" \"No.\" \"Did you noticed what kind of car he was driving maybe overhear where they were going?\" \"I don't know what car but they were heading up to Flagstaff.\" \" Flagstaff?\" \" That's what they said.\" \"Got another regular.\" \"She's always on a diet.\" \"Brings in a scale and her own salad dressing.\" \" Thank you.\" \" You're welcome.\" \"Guy knows we're after him, but he still risks coming here.\" \"8 or 9.\" \"Twice a day.\" \"He didn't know if it's day or night, just the time.\" \"He was waiting for her.\" \"Alright.\" \"There is a traffic cam over there, bank 7-11 across the street.\" \"Just run all the tapes.\" \"We will get lucky and catch him at the wide.\" \"Hey, your bubby Roybal, the casino chief?\" \"Had his throat cut last night after getting a knee cap shot off.\" \"You're telling me this now?\" \"We just talked him about Johnson.\" \" Hey, I just found out.\" \" Alright.\" \" Local weapon?\" \" Dead end.\" \"The forensics came up empty.\" \"Not a hair not a fibre.\" \"Somebody wants information.\" \"Now, next time anything happens relevant to Johnson, I want to know right away.\" \" I don't care if it's a paper cut.\" \" Okay, boss.\" \"The head of casino security.\" \"What did you learn from him?\" \"For a macho guy, he screams like a girl.\" \"But he was questioned by federal agents, looking for Cris Jonhson.\" \"Yes?\" \"He said they hadn't found him yet.\" \"Do you believe this shit?\" \"He can see things before they happen?\" \"It makes no difference what I believe.\" \"Look, we spent two years setting this up.\" \"And that man out there is worried all this will be comprimised by Johnson.\" \"We're wasting our time looking for some magician.\" \"We're being paid to secure the operations, Jones not to hunt down some carnival barker.\" \"Really?\" \"Then why are the same authorities that are looking for us so interested in him?\" \"Get rid of him.\" \"Do it now.\" \"Hey.\" \"Have a super reservation.\" \"I teach here once a week.\" \"The conditions are pretty lousy.\" \"But it's in the Canyon.\" \"One of the eight wonders of the world.\" \" Hi, Sam.\" \" Hi, Liz.\" \"A couple hundred years ago this tribe was booming.\" \"Plenty of food and thriving culture.\" \"They should be better off but I guess this is just their destiny.\" \"I would like to meet their shaman.\" \"I read once that in the many North American tribes their shamans purpose wasn't only healing.\" \"But they also claim to have power of the atmosphere.\" \"To bring on or stop rain even know future advance.\" \"Do you think that's possible?\" \"I believe any thing is possible.\" \"Me too.\" \" Whose birthday?\" \" One of my students.\" \"Hi.\" \"How's it going?\" \"Hello, how is everybody?\" \"Good?\" \"That's good.\" \"That, that was a lot good.\" \"But you messed up on the last part.\" \"On the last part, yeah.\" \"I thought you weren't coming back til next monday.\" \"Well I'm not, but it's Jake's birthday.\" \"How could I miss that?\" \"Whose that man you're with?\" \" Is he your boyfriend?\" \" No, no, he's not my boyfriend.\" \"He's just my friend.\" \"I think he likes you.\" \"Why would you say that?\" \"Because he looks at you like my brother looks at his girlfriend.\" \"Hey, Jake.\" \"Do you want to see some magic?\" \"I'll show you something.\" \"Come here.\" \"I found this rock out in the Canyon.\" \"And I want you to hold it because it's a magic rock.\" \"That's right.\" \"Hold it really tight, keep squeezing.\" \"It's magic.\" \"It won't bite.\" \"Happy birthday.\" \"So you're a magician?\" \"Well.\" \"I have a small magic act back in Vegas.\" \"The Frank Cadillac show.\" \" I thought your name was Cris.\" \" It is.\" \"Frank Cadillac is my stage name.\" \"How did you come up with that?\" \"I picked two things I really like and I put them together.\" \"Frankenstein and Cadillacs.\" \"You are odd.\" \"Charming.\" \"But odd.\" \"Cease fire!\" \"Get out of the range!\" \"Nice.\" \"A little close though.\" \"Okay.\" \"You were right about the traffic cam.\" \"We got a positive ID.\" \"I'm sorry.\" \"Don't be.\" \"It's okay.\" \" Did I drool?\" \" Drool?\" \" Yeah.\" \" What?\" \"Drool, no.\" \" Oh my god, it's coming down so hard.\" \" Yeah.\" \"I like rain.\" \"I like rain too.\" \"You know once, I think was in Denmark it rained fish.\" \"Cause the sun dehydrated the water.\" \"Took it out in the atmosphere.\" \"Rehydrated the fish eggs, and they hatched and rained fish.\" \"Is it true?\" \"Yeah, in the clouds.\" \"True story.\" \"Happened 50 years ago.\" \"Just felt like sharing that with you.\" \"The road washed out ahead.\" \"You can't cross till morning.\" \"Not even then if this keeps up.\" \"Spin around and go back about 2 miles, take your second left there'll be a motel there called...\" \" The Cliffhanger.\" \"Thanks.\" \"Right.\" \"Him right?\" \"That's it.\" \"There's no front plate, where's the other side?\" \"I don't have it.\" \"What was that at the front window?\" \"Go back.\" \"Back, back.\" \"Back, there!\" \"Zoom in.\" \"It's a permit.\" \"Track it and find her.\" \"I'll light a fire.\" \"Cris, one little problem.\" \"Oh, no, no, no...\" \"I'm gonna sleep in the car.\" \" Here.\" \" Oh, thanks.\" \"Sure.\" \"Hey, did you hear the joke about the zen master who ordered the hot dog?\" \"No.\" \"He said he'd have one with everything.\" \"Good night.\" \"Good night.\" \"What do we have?\" \"They're at the Cliffhanger Motel outside Flagstaff.\" \"We found an Arizona foreman who remembered the land cruiser.\" \"Why would he do that?\" \"The road was floaded.\" \"He was about to suggest a place to stay.\" \" But Johnson already knew, right?\" \" Exactly.\" \"Callie, it just got worse.\" \"All right people, we got a nuclear alert.\" \"Code red.\" \"In the southern California region.\" \"L.A. to San Diego, 95% certainty.\" \"Nuclear emergency search teams are on the way, but until they get here somebody please tell me what my agency, the FBI is doing about it?\" \"Well, sir, tier 1 suspects have been interrogated.\" \"Cars and premises have been checked.\" \"Friends and aquintances.\" \"We have opened up surveillance on tier 2 and 3 suspects but nothing actionable yet.\" \"Oh, is that what we're doing?\" \"Waiting for something actionable?\" \"There are 8 million lives that are precarious at best so I say we widen the net to slightly suspicious and get some decent Intel before this nuke blows up Los Angeles.\" \"Alright, Callie.\" \"What do you propose we do next?\" \"I believe that the urgency of the situation...\" \"We know where he is.\" \"Let my team pick him up.\" \"The FBI are mobilizing.\" \"Continue watching.\" \" Did you have the image?\" \" Yes.\" \"He said they're mobilizing.\" \"Standard procedure when security is escalated.\" \"Tell him to wrap it up.\" \"They'll lead us straight to Johnson.\" \" Don't lose sight of them.\" \"Understand?\" \" Okay, certainly.\" \"You hungry?\" \"There's a coffee shop down the road.\" \"I'd rather eat here, if that's okay.\" \"Sure.\" \"What?\" \"There's an Italian painter named Carlatti.\" \"And he defined beauty.\" \"He said it was a summation of the parts working together in such a way that that nothing needed to be added.\" \"Taken away or altered.\" \"That's you.\" \"You're beautiful.\" \"That was incredible.\" \"What was?\" \"This.\" \"Right here.\" \"Gives us a good stand up position and a open view of the front of the motel.\" \"We can multiple pull in area surveillances, from this road here, that turn off.\" \"Get a team with a parabolic set right here.\" \"That's fine, but I also want mobile surveillance and get me 2 or 3 roamers.\" \"If he rabbits on us, I wanna be flexible.\" \"Ferris.\" \"Call the local police in Flagstaff.\" \"Tell them to hold the outside perimeter.\" \"I want that area locked down.\" \"A body turned out in an apartment, with the line of sight to my office...\" \"Slit throat, like Roybal.\" \"Somebody trying to follow us to Johnson.\" \"Cris?\" \"Yeah?\" \"Maybe there is such a thing as destiny.\" \"Give it 40 seconds.\" \"So after two minutes, he just stops seeing what's gonna happen?\" \"I sure as hell hope so.\" \" Elizabeth Cooper?\" \" Yeah.\" \"Federal Agent Ferris.\" \" What is this about?\" \" I'm gonna need a few minutes of your time.\" \"Yeah, okay.\" \"They're putting her in the car.\" \" Drop the gun, step back.\" \" It's his gun.\" \"He was gonna shoot 2 people.\" \"This was 3 days ago?\" \"He used you to get away from Las Vegas.\" \"You can be pretty sure, the everything he told you is a lie.\" \"He's delusional.\" \"A sociopath.\" \"Oh my God.\" \"My god.\" \"Oh, shit.\" \"Oh, shit!\" \"Go back to the motel.\" \"Have a drink.\" \"Put one of these in his glass.\" \"It'll take 5 minutes to put him to sleep, then we'll come in and get him.\" \"Nobody's been hurt.\" \"But this is important, you need to do it at least 2 minutes after you get him out of the room.\" \"Why do you need me?\" \"Why can't you just get him?\" \"Liz, as I understand that you work for a federal funded program teaching on a various reservations.\" \"Is that true?\" \"Yes, that's true.\" \"Well, I think you'll be eager to help us.\" \"We're on the same team.\" \"Now they letting her go.\" \" Thanks for the note.\" \" Sure.\" \" Did you have a nice walk?\" \" I did.\" \"You know, it's really
