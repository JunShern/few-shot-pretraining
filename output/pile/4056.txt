Samuel G. Wilson, District\nJudge. (CA-04-19)\n\n\nSubmitted:    March 30, 2005                 Decided:   April 8, 2005\n\n\nBefore NIEMEYER and GREGORY, Circuit Judges, and HAMILTON, Senior\nCircuit Judge.\n\n\nDismissed by unpublished per curiam opinion.\n\n\nRod Turner, Appellant Pro Se. Donald Eldridge Jeffrey, III, OFFICE\nOF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF VIRGINIA, Richmond, Virginia, for\nAppellee.\n\n\nUnpublished opinions are not binding precedent in this circuit.\nSee Local Rule 36(c).\n\fPER CURIAM:\n\n            Rod   Turner,   a   state    prisoner,   seeks     to   appeal   the\n\ndistrict court\u2019s order denying relief on his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n\n(2000) petition.     An appeal may not be taken from the final order\n\nin a \u00a7 2254 proceeding unless a circuit justice or judge issues a\n\ncertificate of appealability.           28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000).         A\n\ncertificate of appealability will not issue for claims addressed by\n\na district court absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a\n\nconstitutional right.\u201d       28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000).          A prisoner\n\nsatisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists\n\nwould find both that his constitutional claims are debatable and\n\nthat any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are\n\nalso debatable or wrong.        See Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U.S. 322,\n\n336 (2003); Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 484 (2000); Rose v.\n\nLee, 252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir. 2001).              We have independently\n\nreviewed the record and conclude that Turner has not made the\n\nrequisite   showing.        Accordingly,     we   deny   the   motion    for   a\n\ncertificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal.                We dispense\n\nwith oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are\n\nadequately presented in the materials before the court and argument\n\nwould not aid the decisional process.\n\n                                                                      DISMISSED\n\n\n\n\n                                    - 2 -\n\f"
