    "text": "Tuesday May 10, 2011\n3:00 Allison Lichter:\nHello all, thanks for joining this live chat. Cynthia Crossen and James B. Stewart will be getting started in just a moment.\n\n3:00 cynthia crossen:\nWelcome, everyone, to a conversation about perjury with James B. Stewart, author of a new book, \u201cTangled Webs.\u201d\nOne of the four case histories in the book is about Barry Bonds, who recently got a hung jury on three counts of lying under oath about his alleged use of steroids. Yet Jim makes a very convincing case that Bonds repeatedly lied under oath. Why is perjury such a hard case to make?\n\n3:02 James Stewart I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any real doubt, based on the evidence that was admitted at trial as well as the doping calendars that were excluded, that Barry Bonds knowingly used steroids and then lied about that repeatedly. In fact, his grand jury transcript is pretty much a case study in evasive and misleading answers.\n\n3:04 James Stewart But juries sometimes reach verdicts in strange ways. One thing they often consider is the idea that \u201ceveryone is doing it\u201d even though that technically isn\u2019t a defense, and certainly won\u2019t be found in any jury instructions.\n\n3:04 cynthia crossen:\nI wonder if some jurors just think lying is par for the course, especially when a guy is a hero like Bonds. Maybe it just seems like small stuff to bring down such a big guy.\n\n3:05 James Stewart They (and by \u201cthey\u201d it\u2019s usually one juror) simply refuse to convict if they feel the defendant was unfairly singled out. One of the votes on a perjury count in the Bonds case was 11-1 to convict.\n\n3:06 cynthia crossen:\nAlso, don\u2019t defendants say things like they \u201cmisremembered\u201d or \u201cmisspoke\u201d? How is that different from lying?\n\n3:07 James Stewart There\u2019s an amazing example in my book related to the Bonds investigation. The defendant said under oath he\u2019d never met a certain steroid dealer named \u201cMemo.\u201d The prosecutors had a photo of the two of them together in San Antonio! Memo said they\u2019d met repeatedly. The defense didn\u2019t even challenge the photo. Yet one juror refused to convict! Afterwards the judge addressed the jurors, and said, \u201cI just have one question, how in God\u2019s name did you come up with this verdict?\u201d or words to that effect.\n\n3:08 James Stewart This is a problem once perjury becomes pervasive. Jurors assume everyone is doing it and won\u2019t convict. I\u2019m surprised they even convicted Bonds on one count.\n\n3:08 Allison Lichter:\nHere\u2019s a link to Mr. Stewart\u2019s book, for those who want more information.\n\n3:09 Comment From Inagua\nPlease comment on Bill Clinton\u2019s statements about Lewinsky. Did Clinton lie under oath or just to the public?\n\n3:11 James Stewart I think we have to be frank about the root causes of a perjury epidemic, and it starts at the top. The president of the U.S. is the top law enforcement officer in the country, not to mention a role model. In President Clinton we had a president who committed perjury, only grudgingly admitted it, and has never really apologized for it or acted like he feels any remorse.\n\n3:12 cynthia crossen:\nNone of the four main characters in your book seemed to feel any remorse\u2013even Martha Stewart, who went to jail for lying.\n\n3:13 James Stewart In his successor President Bush we had a president who commuted Scooter LIbby\u2019s sentence, in effect condoning it. What kind of message does that send? I\u2019ve talked to many prosecutors, who told me the worst thing that ever happened to trying to deter perjury was Clinton\u2019s and Bush\u2019s actions. This has got to stop.\n3:16 James Stewart It\u2019s true, none of them have showed remorse. I think step one in showing remorse is to admit you did something wrong. Martha Stewart, Scooter LIbby, and Barry Bonds are still saying they\u2019re innocent. Martha Stewart is further poisoning the debate by claiming she was persecuted for being a successful woman. Bernie Madoff has admitted he lied repeatedly, but I think he\u2019s a sociopath and isn\u2019t really capable of feeling remorse.\n\n3:16 Comment From Tom Riley\nI teach, and we are finding dishonesty, not telling lies per se, but stealing others work, to be a growing problem in Higher Ed. The \u201cEveryone is doing it\u201d syndrome seems to be one of the excuses offered.\n\n3:17 James Stewart I teach, too, and my colleagues complain about plagiarism and other forms of cheating and then lying about it. My book is about the most serious lying\u2013 criminal lying.\n\n3:18 cynthia crossen:\nI know some universities used to make their students take an oath that they hadn\u2019t cheated on a paper or exam. I wonder if they still do that. But I\u2019m also wondering if the fact that we live in a more secular society makes lying under oath more acceptable. \u201cSo help me God\u201d just doesn\u2019t have the power it once did for a lot of people.\n\n3:19 James Stewart It\u2019s also about people who are successful, well educated, rich\u2013 role models. When they lie, and everyone knows they\u2019re lying, and seem to get away with it, then it filters down through very degree of dishonesty, from serious issues like academic integrity to even petty examples. If we don\u2019t stop criminal lying, then how can we expect to stop less serious lying?\n\n3:20 Comment From Steve\nI\u2019ve always thought that lying is about cowardice. Do we live in a more pusillanimous society today? Is your point that, there is more lying or that it is easier to get away with? Or that big lies like Madoff\u2019s affect more people and a greater part of society?\n\n3:23 cynthia crossen:\nI\u2019m just throwing in this thought\u2013I\u2019m not a lawyer, although Jim is. But Isn\u2019t lying built into the legal system by the automatic pleas of not guilty even when someone has been caught with a smoking gun in their hands and marked bills in their pockets?\n\n3:24 James Stewart Telling the truth often takes courage. it means accepting short-term negative consequences for longer term benefits. In the Martha Stewart case, Douglas Faneuil, the stock broker\u2019s young assistant who was pressured to lie, learned that the hard way. But people face many difficult ethical dilemmas in life, and doing the right thing often requires courage. I can\u2019t prove there\u2019s more lying under oath going on, but that\u2019s what prosecutors told me, and they deal with it every day. I definitely suspect that there\u2019s more lying under oath by people who should know better, who, as I said, are rich and powerful and influence the behavior of others. This is what I find so troubling. And an important theme of my book, maybe the most important to me, is that perjury has serious consequences, not just for individuals, but for the judicial system, the political system, and the fiancial system. The SEC knew Madoff was lying under oath but did nothing. If that\u2019s the attitude of law enforcement, we\u2019re going to get more Madoffs\u2013and worse.\n\n3:25 Comment From Bethany\nWhat do you think about the court system contributing to dishonesty by allowing someone to plead to a crime without admitting guilt? I have always found this to be unsatisfying, both for the offender and for the person harmed. Admitting guilt, I think, is an important component of changing to a more positive direction.\n\n3:27 James Stewart If you\u2019re pleading guilty to a crime, you have to admit guilt. Even President Clinton had to admit that he gave false, misleading and evasive testimony under oath. But the SEC, in civil enforcement actions, often allows a defendant to settle without admitting guilt.\n\n3:28 James Stewart I agree that this is unsatisfying. I\u2019m sure the SEC sees it as a way to get more cases resolved and get some penalties and deterrence, but it\u2019s used far too often. It\u2019s why Martha Stewart goes around saying she was never guilty of insider trading, even though she settled SEC charges of insider trading and paid a fine.\n\n3:29 cynthia crossen:\nI agree that someone admitting guilt is cathartic for society, but the consequences can be so dire for the person that they must feel it would be better to take a chance on not getting caught. Martha Stewart, as Jim points out in the book, was worried that admitting guilt would result in her public company\u2019s stock getting hammered and her public image being irrevocably tarnished.\n\n3:31 James Stewart And even in criminal cases, defendants sometimes admit a little bit of guilt, but not nearly enough of it. When Olympic track start Marion Jones finally had to plead guilty to two counts of perjury, she made a statement to the judge, and she reverted to the same old story that while she used steroids, she thought it was \u201cflaxseed oil,\u201d (the same preposterous alibi Barry Bonds came up with.) The judge reminded her she was under oath and expressed skepticism. But the prosecutor just sat there and let her get away with it.\n\n3:32 Comment From Richard Coshow\nIt appears a failure to take personal responsibility goes hand in hand with the lying and the perjuries. Could you please comment?\n\n3:34 James Stewart Lying about what you did is the essence of not taking personal responsibility. Some of these characters seem to think that being able to keep saying they are innocent is even more important than serving time in jail. As long as their fans keep swallowing these lies, that\u2019s what we\u2019ll get. In that sense, I\u2019m afraid they are a mirror of broader values in society \u2014 the ends justify the means, and we\u2019ll all look the other way and let them get away with it.\n\n3:36 James Stewart I wish there was an easy remedy. But I feel strongly that deterrence has to start at the top, with the President, with the Attorney General and the Justice department, stressing that perjury is a serious crime that will be prosecuted. And at the other end, all of us have a role to play. My book is fillled with people I\u2019d call \u201cenablers.\u201d\n\n3:38 James Stewart They didn\u2019t necessarily lie themselves, but they covered up, they looked the other way, they didn\u2019t want to confront someone who was rich and powerful. Maybe the most important thing is to teach our children the sanctity of the oath to tell the truth.\n\n3:39 cynthia crossen:\nDon\u2019t some people think perjury is a petty crime\u2013in your book you mentioned Kay Bailey Hutchinson saying Libby\u2019s lying under oath was more or less a technicality.\n\n3:41 James Stewart I was shocked by that\u2026she siad it wasn\u2019t a \u201creal crime,\u201d whatever that means. it is a felony and has been since this country was founded. I guess some of our elected officials need a civics lesson. Laws against perjury go back thousands of years and are a bedrock of civilization. Why?\n\n3:43 James Stewart You see in many cases in my book where loyalty trumps the obligation to give truthful testimony. Barry Bonds trainer lied and then refused to testify out of loyalty to Bonds. he went to jail. When he got out, the inmates gave him a standing ovation. I mean, this is the law of the prison yard. It\u2019s the law of the mafia. When loyalty reigns supreme, then the strongest\u2013 those who can demand loyalty\u2013 rule. This is the law of the jungle.\n\n3:44 cynthia crossen:\nI\u2019m afraid we only have time for one more question.\n\n3:44 Comment From Keith\nI am glad that there are people who care enough to talk and write about this. While no one is perfect, lying has become far too acceptable in this society. What are some small steps that the average person can take to promote a culture of integrity?\n\n3:47 James Stewart Every child is going to lie at some point to test the reaction. I know I did. And I\u2019ve never forgotten the reaction. So I think we can all, in the home, do our part. And then we can withhold our approval of those who lie under oath and never express any contrition or even admit it. I for one don\u2019t think Barry Bonds should be allowed to keep the home run crown that Hank Aaron deserves. We never know when we\u2019re going to have to confront serious lying in our daily lives. We have to be prepared for it and be willing to have the courage to stand up for the truth.\n\n3:49 cynthia crossen:\nThank you everyone for joining in this fascinating discussion. I highly recommend Jim\u2019s book\u2013it\u2019s as entertaining as it is revealing.\n\n3:49 Allison Lichter:\nThanks to everyone for joining us.

Only sycophantic comments were allowed in the \"chat\"; no dissonance on Martha Stewart in Cynthia Crossen's hyping and hawking of the book: \"I highly recommend Jim's book.\"\n\nBoth James Stewart and Cynthia Crossen have no personal knowledge of the facts of the Martha Stewart case; but that didn't matter to them in their unrestrained false statements on Ms. Stewart. Both commisserated and pontificated on\" lying\" while in a \"lying\" mode themselves on Martha Stewart .\n\nCynthia Crossen first invoked the name of Martha Stewart, \"who went to jail for lyiing.\" The truth is she \"went to jail\" because of legal malpractice. Her lawyer was Lawrence Pedowitz. Crossen has no personal knowledge of \"lying\" by Martha Stewart; and no evidence existed in her own words of any \"lying\" by her\n\nJames Stewart stated Douglas Faneuil \"was pressured to lie.\" Ms. Stewart had nothing to do with this in any shape or form. Any \"pressure to lie\" came from the Bush goons where the ends justified the means and who \"were so happy about Martha Stewart getting convicted...as a deterrent.\".\n\nJsmes Stewart stated, \"Martha Stewart goes around saying she was never guilty of insider trading, even though she settled SEC charges of insider trading and paid a fine.\" Ms. Stewart doesn't have the time of day for this nonsense; she has moved on with her life, and her focus and attention are on her company, her tv shows, her blog, and her tweets that have nothing to do with \"insider trading.\" \"Insider trading\" is illegal stock trading, and \"guilty of insider trading\" comes only with legal adjudication in a court of law; the SEC is no court of law. The SEC baseless allegations on Martha Stewart were nothing more than regulatory overreach, regulatory tyranny, and regulatory activism. There was no agreement to any \"insider trading\" by Ms. Stewart, who settled for the survival of her company. The \"fine\" she paid was nothing more than extortion and expropriation by the SEC, which cared nothing about the survival of her company and the jobs of her employees.\n\nJames Stewart and Cynthia Crossen speculated that \"Martha Stewart was worried\" about \"admitting guilt.\" The fact is the Bush goons, in complicity with incompetent legal representation (Ms. Stewart's lawyer was Lawrence Pedowitz), piled on the bogus charges to coerce her to cop a plea; but because of her strong moral foundation, Ms. Stewart declined to countenance any plea bargaining on the trumped-up charges, including the big-time bogus charge with 10 years prison and a $2 million fine that was thrown out in court as completely wacko, which resulted from legal malpractice. (Ms. Stewart's lawyer was Lawrence Pedowitz.)\n\nJames Stewart stated: \"My book is about the most serious lying - criminal lying. James Stewart's book of deceit on Martha Stewart, which is being hyped and hawked with ruthless lies on Martha Stewart for financial gain is clearly \"serious lying - criminal lying.\"\n\nIs there no end to the victimization of Martha Stewart? Will there never be any security for the jobs and the shareholder value that she embodies? Are there no bounds of journalistic integrity for the freedom of the press and bounds of decency for First Amendment free speech?\n\n5:02 pm May 10, 2011\n\nG Chu wrote :\n\nIn the propagandist \"live chat,\" James Stewart states, \"Martha Stewart is further poisoning the debate by claiming she was persecuted for being a successful woman.\" However, in the hyping and hawking by National Public Radio, James Stewart stated, \"'A lot of prosecutors told me that they were so happy about Martha Stewart getting convicted, not because they had any personal animus against her but because she's so visible that it served as a deterrent,' he says\". Would \"it served as a deterrent\" if Martha Stewart was not a \"successful woman\"?\n\n4:40 pm May 10, 2011\n\nsunny wrote :\n\nG Chu--we get it--you are Martha or one of her minions. So, she's claiming her [devil of a] lawyer made her do it. Not impressive. She believed she was untouchable, because she was an \"insider\" and was entitled to inside info. Lying in a fed investigation is a crime; oath/recording not required. You post her atty's name multiple times--is she out to ruin him? I must assume that, when she hired him, she believed he was top-notch, so your charges of malpractice ring hollow. Any lawyer can only do so much with a bad witness/bad facts. Didn't her broker suffer a worse fate than she? She made a choice, and it had consequences."
