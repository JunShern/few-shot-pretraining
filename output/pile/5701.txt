I could imagine that this is the replacement for the Cow Level from Diablo II, but I hope that is not the case.  How do I get to this area?  Are there any monsters or treasure to be had, or any other benefit to going there?\n\nA:\n\nTo get to the Fowl Lair you need to use the Ancient Device in Desolate Sands. It is one of the 10 possible outcomes of using the Ancient Device. So take note that not only is the spawn of the device random but there's only 10% of getting the Fowl Lair.\nWhere are all the random dungeons?\nThis contains a community wiki of random locations and which zones they are in. It was revised to add Fowl Lair based on this forum thread:\nhttp://us.battle.net/d3/en/forum/topic/5149619068 \n\nThe plateau on the map (obviously random location, but that's the shape)  \n\nThe Ancient Device\n\nThe entrance to the Fowl Lair after succesfully spawning it using the device (took A LOT of tries)  \n\nInside the Fowl Lair\n\n"
