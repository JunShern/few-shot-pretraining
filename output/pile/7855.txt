    "text": "If Your Landing Page Could Talk, What Would It Say?\n\nMy job is to greet you when you click on ads, email links and social media posts. You will find me by scanning a QR code.\n\nYou come to me because you want something. You have requested my presence on your screen by taking a very specific action, and you expect a very specific result.\n\nI try not to let you down.\n\nI want you to know you are in the right place; that I have an answer for you. Your search has not been in vain.\n\nI want you to trust me. I want you to know that others have been here and prospered because of it. I do not fool myself. I may be the first emissary of this website that you have seen, brought here by a promise and expecting that promise be kept.\n\nIt is a weighty responsibility I have.\n\nI have seen you through the screen, wide-eyed and eager, but with the telltale signs of skepticism.\n\nI am the butler, the ma\u00eetre d\u2019. It is my job to bring you into the establishment and help you find your place. No, the home page is not equipped to perform this task any more than a pack mule is equipped to drive a race car.\n\nVisitors to your landing page are different from those visiting your home page.\n\nThese are not the eyes of a home page visitor, with lids half closed and darting back and forth. Have you seen a home page?\n\nThe Schizophrenia Of The Home Page\n\nThis poor page is both mumbling and screaming at the same time. She changes her hat every few seconds\u2026 just before you\u2019ve finished reading the last.\n\nIt\u2019s like those disconnected homeless people pushing a cart full of stuff but talking to no one in particular; or maybe they\u2019re talking to a light post.\n\nAnd she\u2019s always talking about herself, even more so that that About Us page.\n\nIs your shopping cart all business?\n\nThe Shopping Cart\n\nHave you seen the shopping cart? He\u2019s all business, and little in the way of social skills.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere do you live?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is on your credit card?\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you choose the right shipping method?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen was the last time you had sex?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you suffer from any rashes?\u201d\n\nI shudder to think that I must send my trusting visitors off to such a sterile and brash group of pages, but what choice to I have?\n\nSplitting My Personality\n\nI am not the same as I have always been. I have had many forms. I have had different headings, longer and shorter copy, a form, a button and different images.\n\nI am regularly cloned and changed.\n\nSplit test landing pages to learn more about your visitors.\n\nYou might not even notice the difference between me an my cloned \u201ctwin.\u201d It\u2019s usually one thing, often sometimes small, but sometimes major. Then my creators pit us against each other, sending one visitor to me and one to the other.\n\nOur visitors tell them which they prefer. They vote with their dollars and with their contact information. They vote with downloads, listens and views. They also vote by leaving, perhaps for a competitor.\n\nMy creators use terms like \u201cConversion Rate\u201d and \u201cRevenue per Visit\u201d and \u201cBounce Rate\u201d to measure us. And when I win they call me \u201cThe Control,\u201d a badge I wear with honor. It means that I\u2019m a better friend to my visitors and to my creators.\n\nA Gift To My Visitors\n\nI have had many forms over my lifetime. Sometimes I\u2019ve been a disappointment to visitors, and a godsend at other times.\n\nI am often most successful when my creators find me ugly. Sometimes they choose the loser because he is prettier.\n\nThis makes me sad.\n\nYet, here I remain, a faithful servant to my visitors. Anticipating their needs, delivering what they want, and making the Web a better place for surfers and my creators alike.\n\nA Note From The Author\n\nThere is a segment of almost any search audience for whom relationships are an important part of their decisions. If you have read this far, you may very well be one of them. The Eisenberg brothers call these people Humanists, and they are particularly difficult to serve online because websites tend to be informational in nature. It\u2019s difficult to build relationships with Web pages.\n\nAnthropomorphism is a writing technique that gives animals and inanimate objects human-like characteristics. This approach may be a more effective way of encouraging the use of landing pages than some of the others I\u2019ve written. I think the technique appeals to these Humanist searchers.\n\nYou probably are a Competitive in certain situations, but maybe Humanist when learning.\n\nI\u2019m talking about \u201cflipping\u201d copy from Humanist to Competitive to Spontaneous to Methodical in my Conversion Conference presentation in April.\n\nhttp://www.submitshop.co.uk/blog Submitshop UK\n\nGood job. I would like to add some points .Some landing\npages are too annoying.Basically, when I see a landing page, I want to find the\ninformation I\u2019m looking for in the first 5-10 seconds. Otherwise, I\u2019m going to\nlook somewhere else. Landing page generate profits effectively so keep them\nshort and to the point. If you add video in your landing pages then it will\nwork like icing on the cake because they are more engaging & increase\nconversions.\n\nhttp://twitter.com/sj2go Sean Jordan\n\nOur landing pages literally talk. We use live chat 24-7/36 on all landing pages. This puts the perception of control in the users hand so they can feel free to ask a question anytime and get an immediate answer. Live chat means LIVE, ALWAYS ON, never ever ..\u2019We\u2019re offline, leave a message\u2019 ..that\u2019s just lame.\n\nhttp://twitter.com/MktgbyNathan Nathan Johnson\n\nI like your approach. Landing page talk can get boring. This is a nice way to change it up.\n\nhttp://conversionscientist.com Brian Massey\n\nLanding pages must support visitors who make decisions quickly and emotionally.\nSome visitors will be put off by a page that doesn\u2019t have enough information. However, every page must communicate one thing to every visitor within a few seconds: \u201cYou are in the right place.\u201d\n\nhttp://conversionscientist.com Brian Massey\n\nWe see live chat as a conversion \u201caccelerators\u201d \u2014 those things that have the potential to provide a step function increase in results (and often require a significant commitment of resources).
