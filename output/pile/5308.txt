Please login or register to post messages and view our exclusive members-only content. You'll gain access to additional forums, file attachments, board customizations, encrypted private messages, and much more!\n\nFirst off... DAMN YOU PETCO!! BASTARDS. ok.I bought wheat straw, pasteurized it, spawned it, than I ask the question when its too late. Oh well. I spawned the straw and it has a few of the seedling things still in it, someones telling me its going to cause contams for me, if there is a god please lemme get some shrooms... I have a lot of spawn mixed in so the spawn to substrate ratio is probally like 3:1 and there is a heavy topcoat of spawn over the whole shabang. Whaddya think guys?This is what the things look like:\n\nWith such a high ratio of spawn to straw I would think that it should colonize quick enough to stave off any possible contams. As with any endevor there is always a potential for failure as well. I believe that you have a good chance to make it though this without problems, but only time will tell.\n\nGood Luck\n\n--------------------YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH ANY GIVEN DRUG ISN'T THE DEFINITIVE MEASURE OF THE DRUGS EFFECTS.\n\nspawned them today... i got mad spawn up in those fuckers knew it would help in fighting off contams. hopefuly ill be alright. i still got some colonized substrate and more substrate that just was innoculated. next im going to do a glovebox and start g2g transfers.. can anyone else ellaborate on the straw situation?\n\nanyone else got any comments.. it seems to be coming along good. i think there might possibly be contam in one, not sure though, its a very small spot, lets see if it gets bigger. by the way everyone like my new avatar? my girlfriend is the shit\n\nmy shit is on day 17 and there is still some straw on the top of the thing that is completely like uncolonzied but its only a few pieces on top of the whole thing. i don't think its gonna grow over, what should i do?"
