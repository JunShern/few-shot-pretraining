An example is always better.\nOnce in home:\nluiz@feynman:~$ cd Music/\nluiz@feynman:~/Music$ cd Beatles/\nluiz@feynman:~/Music/Beatles$ cd 17\\ Love/\n\nWhat is annoying me is this :~/Music  or ~/Music/Beatles before $. It seems a stupid problem but when I need to enter into many folders is really a big problem.\nI guess I should change something in my .bashrc, but I don't know what. \nThanks\n\nA:\n\nYou can use this prompt for PS1\nPS1='\\u@\\h: $(x=$(pwd); l=${#x}; if [ $l -lt 24 ]; then echo $x; else echo ... ${x: -20};fi;)\\$'\n\nJust put this at the very end of your .bashrc. From now every time you go to a path with a length greater than 24 it'll show the last 20 characters preceding by .... In fact when we go deep down a directory only the last directories become significant. Because we already know where we started.\n\nA:\n\nlook at and edit the value of $PS1. It contains the template for your prompt.\nSomething like '\\u@\\h \\w $ ' is typical, in this the '\\w' is a placeholder for the working directory. SettingPS1'\\u@\\h $ '` would remove the working directory.\nFor full details on how to set PS1, consult the bash man page\n\n"
