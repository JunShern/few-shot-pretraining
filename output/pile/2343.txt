If I'm not supposed to call new LocationRequest(), then what is the proper way to do it?\n\nA:\n\nUse static methodLocationRequest create ().\n LocationRequest locationRequest = LocationRequest.create();\n locationRequest.setPriority(LocationRequest.PRIORITY_HIGH_ACCURACY);\n locationRequest.setInterval(5000);\n locationRequest.setFastestInterval(1000);\n\nA:\n\nLocationRequest initialization procedure has changed into latest Google Play Service dependencies ( > 12.0.0). Now you can use its create() method to initialize this. e.g.\nLocationRequest request = LocationRequest.create();\n\n"
