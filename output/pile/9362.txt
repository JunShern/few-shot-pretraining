While no retirement announcement has come out for either, they\u2019ve both been out with long-term injuries. Their absence appears to indicate an end to their respective NHL careers.\n\nReferee Mark Lemelin has been released, and will be officiating in Austria this season.\n\nUpdated Roster of NHL Officials for 2016-17"
