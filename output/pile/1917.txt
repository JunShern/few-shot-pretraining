Floodwaters from Hurricane Ike also destroyed the couple\u2019s apartment.\n\nPhoto by David Nunnelee\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: TDCJ employees living on and near Galveston Island were hit hard by Hurricane Ike last September. Some lost not only all of their personal belongings, but their homes as well. But the winds and floodwaters associated with the hurricane didn\u2019t dampen their determination to bounce back. To help them in their recovery, the North American Association of Wardens and Superintendents (NAAWS) in December presented five Hospital Galveston Unit employees hit especially hard by the storm individual checks for $500. TDCJ Correctional Institutions Division Director Nathaniel Quarterman presented the checks to Senior Warden Monty Hudspeth, CO V Wendolyn Jackson , CO V Robert Goodley, Food Service Capt. Velicia Burns and CO III Karen Martinez.\n\nFollowing is an account of what each of the employees lost, and what some of them found, in the storm.\n\nSenior Warden Monty Hudspeth:\nRetirement home lost in storm to be rebuilt\n\nIt was love at first sight for Terrie Hudspeth. After living in several different communities during the course of her husband\u2019s career with TDCJ, she fell in love with Galveston Island immediately upon his assignment to the hospital unit there in October 2007.\n\n\u201cShe said, \u2018Well, this is where I\u2019m going to retire, and you can move all over the state if you want to, but I\u2019ll be right here,\u2019\u201d Warden Hudspeth said about his wife\u2019s non-negotiable decision to buy a retirement home for the two of them on the island. And in April 2008, they did just that, settling on a one-story home on 53rd Street that they were letting their daughter live in while they continued to stay in a two-story house provided through the state on Ferry Road. Neither residence would survive the storm.\n\nA five-foot wall of water swept by the storm surge inundated the first floor of the couple\u2019s state house, leaving only a few beds and nightstands upstairs until the roof finally collapsed in on top of them. The home provided through the University Texas Medical Branch won\u2019t be repaired. Meanwhile, the couple\u2019s single-story private home suffered so much damage that it was red tagged by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. That meant they would either have to tear down their retirement home or move what remained of it to another location. They could also rebuild on the same site but at an elevation at least 11 feet above the flood plain. The Hudspeths appealed that decision and won a favorable ruling in December, allowing them to rebuild without raising the site elevation.\n\nCO V Wendolyn Jackson:\nGives up home to relatives in need, mold forces second move\n\nWendolyn Jackson didn\u2019t have to move out of her Texas City home after Hurricane Ike. Its roof damage could be repaired. But when her cousins called to tell her that they had lost everything in the storm, she decided to move out and let them move in.\n\u201cThey needed it more than I did,\u201d she said about the home she had lived in since 1990.\n\nJackson moved to an apartment only to learn three months later that she would have to vacate it because toxic mold had been found. But instead of simply returning to her home, she found another apartment.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to go back to my home, and the reason I didn\u2019t want to go back is because everything there brings back memories,\u201d she said.\n\nDespite her travails, Jackson doesn\u2019t feel like she was victimized by the storm.\n\n\u201cI tell everybody that I\u2019m still blessed,\u201d she said. \u201cI look at it like everything happens for a reason. I look at it like the Lord won\u2019t put on me more than I can bear and that this is a test to see how much I can bear. And I bear it.\u201d\n\nJackson said the $500 relief check from NAAWS couldn\u2019t have come at a better time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to help me move,\u201d she said.\n\nCO V Robert Goodley:\nLeft with only single suitcase of clothes after water invades home\n\nAs he watched the water rise outside TDCJ\u2019s hospital facility in Galveston, Robert Goodley figured that some of the rains from Hurricane Ike would probably seep into his first-floor apartment on Ferry Road. What he wasn\u2019t prepared for was the five feet of water that would actually rush in.\n\n\u201cI was anxious about going home,\u201d said Goodley, who rode out the storm on duty at the hospital. \u201cI\u2019d never seen the water that high, so I was pretty much sure that it might have gotten in. I didn\u2019t think it would be that bad, though.\u201d\n\nGoodley got his first inkling of how bad it was when he tried to open the door to his apartment.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t open the door,\u201d he said. \u201cThe air conditioning unit was blown all the way to the door, so I couldn\u2019t get it open. It took me a while to get it open, and when I did, I saw that the whole place was wrecked.\u201d\n\nGoodley lost all his furnishings and clothing inside the apartment.\n\n\u201cI happened to have some clothes in a suitcase because I had been taking offenders to Huntsville,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the clothing I had in the suitcase was pretty much it. I lost everything else.\u201d\n\nGoodley stayed with friends and co-workers until he could arrange for an apartment on the third floor of the complex he had been living in. He said the $500 check from NAAWS would cover some of the debt he incurred in replacing the things he lost.\n\n\u201cIt was unexpected and I definitely appreciate it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to put it in the bank and try to get rid of this debt. I\u2019m just taking things one day at a time.\u201d\n\nThe two-story house at 1201 54th Street in Galveston had been in Velicia Burns\u2019 family for years. It was where she and her husband Clifford had planned to move to sometime this year. But that was before Hurricane Ike destroyed both the home and the first-floor apartment the couple had been occupying at a complex owned by the University of Texas Medical Branch on Ferry Road. So at year\u2019s end, the once residence-rich couple was living in a single room at a local hotel where she said they faced eviction if they tried to cook for themselves.\n\n\u201cThis will help us to where we can go out and eat because we don\u2019t have anywhere to cook,\u201d she said about the $500 check from NAAWS. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how little or how great it is, it still helps.\u201d\n\nTaking heed of the call for a mandatory evacuation of Galveston, Burns fled to Navasota ahead of the storm. There she learned in a call from her sister that Ike\u2019s winds had flattened her house. But she still hoped to find something left of her apartment once she was allowed to return to the island. Instead she found little more than mud and mold.\n\n\u201cWhen I was finally able to get in my home, I was really devastated,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything was turned upside down. It was like someone had gone in there and ransacked it. It was just really a sight. I lost everything.\u201d\n\nStill, Burns, who had just undergone hip replacement surgery, was counting her blessings. She said she and her husband plan to rebuild the home on 54th Street once they can get the debris removed. And until they could find other affordable housing, they would continue to live in the hotel.\n\nCO III Karen Martinez:\nCoping with the loss of the center of her world\n\nThe downstairs of Karen Martinez\u2019s two-story rent house in Galveston was the center of her world. It had a full library, a lounge area and a workout room. It was where she did most of her living.\n\n\u201cIt was very nice,\u201d she said.\n\nNow it\u2019s gone, and she can hardly bring herself to go downstairs to finish cleaning up after Hurricane Ike.\n\n\u201cIt was so devastating that I don\u2019t like to go down there and finish it,\u201d she said three months after the storm. \u201cI\u2019ve been avoiding it. I did what I needed to do just to stop any future problems. It\u2019s just too much for me now.\u201d\n\nMartinez, a New York City native, had just returned to Galveston from a TDCJ assignment out of town when Ike struck.\n\n\u201cI sustained about four feet of water,\u201d she said. \u201cI pretty much lost everything downstairs.\u201d\nThe storm also separated Martinez from her daughter who had been attending college in Galveston but had to enroll in a mainland school following the storm. She said the relief check from NAAWS was particularly meaningful to her."
