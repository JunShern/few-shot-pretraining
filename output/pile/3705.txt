Although I\u2019m mainly found at Twitter, this site is still the home for nearly 20 years of fantastically old weblog entries that have been formatted, re-formatted and un-formatted to all heck (archive+search at the bottom of this page.) It might be more interesting to listen to recent episodes of the podcast I\u2019m on, You Like the Worst Stuff.
