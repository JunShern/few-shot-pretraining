    "text": "New drug policy would require a suspension for first-offense DUI\n\nPosted by Mike Florio on May 25, 2014, 9:58 AM EST\n\nGetty Images\n\nPlenty of changes to the NFL\u2019s substance-abuse policy and PED policy hinge on the league and the NFLPA finalizing an agreement to conduct HGH testing. Some changes would help the players, incorporating third-party arbitration for most appeals and tweaking the rules to reduce suspensions.\n\nOne change would hurt the players, but the players generally are in favor of it.\n\nPer a league source, the new substance-abuse policy (which will be implemented once an HGH testing agreement is reached) would impose a one-game suspension for a first-offense DUI. The penalty also would include a fine in the amount of one game check.\n\nCurrently, the rules require two-game fine for players who ultimately are deemed to be legally responsible for first-offense DUI. Barring unusual circumstances, a suspension arises only for a second offense.\n\nThe league has wanted tougher penalties for several years. The NFLPA, possibly influenced by the reality that a member of the union died in December 2012 while riding with a drunk teammate, wants the enhanced penalty as well.\n\nThe penalty will be put in place as soon as the league and the union iron out the last remaining details of HGH testing. Which, if you\u2019re just joining us, has nothing to do with HGH testing. The policy hinges on whether Commissioner Roger Goodell will retain the ability to resolve appeals of HGH and other PED violations arising not from a positive test but from other evidence of drug use. All appeals based on positive tests will go to third-party arbitration.\n\nAnd the impasse will continue until the two sides can find a middle ground \u2014 or until Moe comes along and clunks Larry\u2019s and Curly\u2019s heads together.\n\nHow about this: First DUI is a one game suspension, with rapid scaling so that the second one is 8 games, and the third you\u2019re out for at least a year with the possibility of reinstatement. If you harm someone while driving under the influence, lifetime ban.\n\nIf you\u2019re caught abusing your spouse, first time is 8 games, second is full season.\n\nMarijuana? Leave it up to the individual teams since the laws vary state to state, and it\u2019s not much different (and probably less damaging) than drinking alcohol. Obviously if you\u2019re caught driving while high the penalties would be the same as above.\n\nSeems easy enough; playing in the NFL is a privilege not a right. Something like what I described above would send the message that the league actually cares about what type of person their players are when out in the community.\n\nJust not if you\u2019re an owner, than you can probably rack up multiple DUIs, have illegal prescription drugs, $29,000 cash etc\u2026\n\ncartire says:May 25, 2014 10:28 AM\n\nWait\u2026.. What\u2019s the difference between the current 2 game check fine, and a 1 game suspension and 1 game check fine? So the player misses a single game, but loses the exact same monetary value. This seems like a pathetic attempt at harsher punishments.\n\nAlso, the only reason players want third party arbitration is to draw the process out even longer in hopes of cheating the system. If you take drugs to enhance performance, stop trying to look for a way out. You were caught, own it.\n\neaglesnoles05 says:May 25, 2014 10:29 AM\n\nConsidering the other probable consequences of DUI, like death or serious bodily injury of yourself or others, why is this even a question.\n\nWhat\u2019s so hard about acting with a modicum of pro decorum while you play pro sports for a few years? It\u2019s not like you can\u2019t drink or womanize within the rules. Hold these idiot\u2019s feet to the fire for this stuff.\n\nThe league needs to let \u2018em burn the cheebah and chill at home or in the back of limo\u2019s and I bet you\u2019ll get at least one less idiot driving around drunk. And doing that when you can easily pay for a driver needs to be made an example of.\n\nThe penalties still seem way too soft. Just because rich elitists don\u2019t worry about the penalties outside of the NFL doesn\u2019t mean that the NFL shouldn\u2019t strive to be better than everybody else and try to develop a model system. If they could do that then they could be a good example for a change and build a business that is respectable, and you can make money off of branding wholesome principles like that too. There would be a LOT of profit available in cleaning up the game and establishing the NFL as one of the best organizations in the world, if not the best. Where\u2019s all the competitive-natured people in the league office? Oh right they are competitive at politics and figuring out how to get big paychecks before disappearing. That sucks.\n\nThe league has wanted tougher penalties for several years. The NFLPA, possibly influenced by the reality that a member of the union died in December 2012 while riding with a drunk teammate, wants the enhanced penalty as well.\n\nJosh Brent. You can write down his name. He got 180 DAYS in jail for killing his friend Jerry Brown. Drunk. Not his first failed DUI, had several failed tests. How would new drug policy prevent stupidity?\n\nThey shouldn\u2019t penalize employees at all. That\u2019s what the legal system is for. The brand won\u2019t ever lose its luster because of stupid things athletes do. I can\u2019t imagine anyone being happy about screwing up and getting smacked down by the law and then getting fined or suspended by their job for a personal issue. Yeah,playing pro ball is a priviledge\u2026so is any job. Fine and suspend players for something that directly affects competition or is considered a felony. Heck,that won\u2019t matter because they\u2019ll probably be locked up anyways and you can terminate their contract. It\u2019s a good conversation piece but obviously the NFL\u2019s popularity doesn\u2019t wane due to this stuff. There\u2019s a list of killers,drunkards and goons that have been a part of the league and yet it still is the number one major sport in the country. Obviously there\u2019s no moral outrage over the NFL because the product hasn\u2019t suffered\n\nWho cares about the freakin \u2018brand\u2019?\nDUI penalties should be stiff \u2013 to do one thing and one thing only.. Save lives.\nI\u2019ve lost friends/family who were both behind the wheel an casualties of someone else behind the wheel.\nI would have no problem with a one year suspension \u2013 loss of compensation for any first time offender.\nIf you want to dissuade the activity \u2013 up the ante enough to make em take notice..\n\nDumb. Zebras don\u2019t change their strips and we got a lot of zebras in the nfl. Just gonna end up suspending a good portion of your product and for what? To send a message that DUIs are bad? I would have never guessed. How about focus on the game of football and not the lawlessness of the players, which is irrelevant to football\n\nSo according to several posters a player is a bad guy deserving punishment if you abuse yourself and your girlfriend (dare I say boyfriend too???), but endangering the welfare of complete strangers is no big deal. Talk about small minded\u2026\n\n- if its the action, than why not texting while driving? Its dangerous and endangers complete strangers. If its because the person is drinking \u2013 why not fat NFL players at BK. This is just the PC police thing to do for the NFL. In fact, taking muscle relaxers or those pain pills while driving can also impact and endanger people \u2013 Wheres the outrage?\n\nSome game checks are very small because for cap reasons the majority of the contract was paid in signing bonuses. Calculate the value of the contract by the number of games in the contract and make that the \u201cone game\u201d value of a fine.\n\ncommonsensedude says:May 25, 2014 8:00 PM\n\nDrunk Driving kills. Throw the hammer down at the first offense and perhaps more players will think twice before racking up a second.\n\njchuber says:May 25, 2014 9:05 PM\n\nWe need to make sure that these new rules apply equally to owners and their staffs, coaches and their staffs, and NFL officals and their staffs.\n\nIn short EVERYONE who represents the NFL to the public.\n\nNo more double standards, where players get hammered, while owners, coaches, and nfl execs can do as they damn well please.\n\nI think this is a great idea. DUIs have not been taken seriously enough by players, and they need to be. Fining a millionaire player isn\u2019t really going to have an impact, but if you make him sit out, then his coaches, owner, and fellow players are not going to be happy and there will be more consequences.\n\nI\u2019m tired of hearing of players, who are supposed to be role models, getting drunk and getting in trouble. Make them sit\u2013that will hit them where it hurts.\n\nI dont know what the hell is wrong with most you idiots on here. I want to see the best players on the field. When in the hell did you the NFL care about people obeying the law. They sure as hell dont care about owners breaking the law, theres no reason to care about players breaking the law, unless its the Aaron Hernandez type of law breaking\n\nJimmyHaslem has his business raided by federal agents, jim Irsay has a dead body in his apt, Ziggy Wilf, getting sued due to unfair business practices\n\nAnd these ninnies in the NFL league office are worried about DUIs. Gimme a frickin break. I want the best players on the field"
