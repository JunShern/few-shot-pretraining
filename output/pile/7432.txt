In re Li Qing Qiu, No. A205 890 367 (B.I.A. July 21,\n\n11   2016), aff\u2019g No. A205 890 367 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City May 21,\n\n12   2015).    We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying\n\n13   facts and procedural history in this case.\n\n14       We have reviewed both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s opinions \u201cfor\n\n15   the sake of completeness.\u201d    Wangchuck v. Dep\u2019t of Homeland\n\n16   Sec., 448 F.3d 524, 528 (2d Cir. 2006).     The applicable\n\n17   standards of review are well established.     8 U.S.C.\n\n18   \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); Yanqin Weng v. Holder, 562 F.3d 510, 513 (2d\n\n19   Cir. 2009).\n\n20       Absent past persecution, an applicant may establish\n\n21   eligibility for asylum by demonstrating a well-founded fear of\n\n22   future persecution, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(2), which must be\n\n23   both subjectively credible and objectively reasonable,\n                                   2\n\f1    Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, 357 F.3d 169, 178 (2d Cir. 2004).\n\n2    To establish a well-founded fear, an applicant must show either\n\n3    a reasonable possibility that she would be singled out for\n\n4    persecution or that the country of removal has a pattern or\n\n5    practice of persecuting individuals similarly situated to her.\n\n6    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(2)(i), (iii).     \u201cPut simply, to establish\n\n7    a well-founded fear of persecution in the absence of any\n\n8    evidence of past persecution, an alien must make some showing\n\n9    that authorities in [her] country of nationality are either\n\n10   aware of [her] activities or likely to become aware of [her]\n\n11   activities.\u201d     Hongsheng Leng v. Mukasey, 528 F.3d 135, 143 (2d\n\n12   Cir. 2008).    Qiu failed to establish a well-founded fear of\n\n13   persecution in China on account of her intentions to practice\n\n14   her Catholic faith in an unregistered church and proselytize.\n\n15       The country conditions evidence provides that tens of\n\n16   millions of individuals practice in unregistered churches in\n\n17   China, and that in some areas unsanctioned religious practices\n\n18   are tolerated without interference.     The evidence does not\n\n19   discuss any incidents of persecution against Catholics for\n\n20   proselytizing.     Therefore, despite evidence of sporadic\n\n21   arrests of religious practitioners and public proselytizers,\n\n22   Qiu did not establish that Chinese officials are likely to\n\n23   become aware of her religious practice (whether worshiping on\n                                   3\n\f1    proselytizing) or a reasonable possibility that she would be\n\n2    persecuted as a result.    See 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(2)(i),\n\n3    (iii); see also Hongsheng Leng, 528 F.3d at 142-43; In re A-M-,\n\n4    23 I. & N. Dec. 737, 741 (B.I.A. 2005) (defining pattern or\n\n5    practice as \u201csystemic or pervasive\u201d persecution of a group).\n\n6        Accordingly, the agency did not err in concluding that Qiu\n\n7    failed to establish a well-founded fear of persecution on\n\n8    account of her religion.      See 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(2)(i),\n\n9    (iii); Hongsheng Leng, 528 F.3d at 142-43.     That finding was\n\n10   dispositive of asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief\n\n11   given that all three claims were based on the same factual\n\n12   predicate.    See Paul v. Gonzales, 444 F.3d 148, 156-57 (2d Cir.\n\n13   2006).\n\n14       For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is\n\n15   DENIED.    As we have completed our review, any stay of removal\n\n16   that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED,\n\n17   and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition\n\n18   is DISMISSED as moot.    Any pending request for oral argument\n\n19   in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of\n\n20   Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule\n\n21   34.1(b).\n\n22                                 FOR THE COURT:\n23                                 Catherine O\u2019Hagan Wolfe, Clerk\n\n                                     4\n\f"
