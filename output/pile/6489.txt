    "text": "Many modalities for measuring blood flow in the human body are in use today, including ultrasound and phase contrast magnetic resonance (PCMR), and the results of such measurements are usually displayed in a variety of ways. However, existing medical software for rendering blood flow information typically presents the information in a rather abstract form. A more clinically useful way of displaying blood information would allow the clinician to visualize the dynamics of a plurality of blood flows in an anatomical context. Such a display could be visually analyzed and utilized as a tool for diagnosis and surgery planning in order to treat medical problems such as stroke."
