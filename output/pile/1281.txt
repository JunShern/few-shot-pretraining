Type 'typeof \"\"' has no compatible call signatures React TypeScript\n\nI'm trying to convert three scripts from Javascript to TypeScript. The scripts can be found in this gist. I do however have one error left that I can't get rid of. Please note that this is my first React and TypeScript project so I can easily have missed something obvious. I'm using .tsx files and TypeScript 2.1.\nIn the file: GoogleApiComponent.tsx\nimport * as cache from './ScriptCache'\n...\ncomponentWillMount() {\n    this.scriptCache = cache({ <--Error TS2349 here\n        google: GoogleApi({\n            apiKey: apiKey,\n            libraries: libraries\n        })\n    });\n}\n\nGives me this error:\nCannot invoke an expression whose type lacks a call signature. Type 'typeof \"ScriptCache\"' has no compatible call signatures.\n\nScriptCache.tsx looks like this:\nlet counter = 0;\nlet scriptMap = new Map();\n\nexport const ScriptCache = (function (global: any) {\n    return function ScriptCache(scripts: any) {\n        const Cache: any = {}\n        ...\n\nA:\n\nLooks like you're import is not correct :)\nPlease try to import it like this import cache from './ScriptCache'. If you just used the code from the gist the cache is also exported as default.\nIf this does not work, try import { ScriptCache as cache } from './ScriptCache'. You do not need the as syntax. This is just so you don't have to change the variable names.\n\n"
