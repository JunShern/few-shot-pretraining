    "text": "Yeah, so, Reddit has mostly gone dark. Not in the sense that anti-Internet freedom government entities have nefariously blocked all or most of the site \u2014 nothing like that. No, Reddit\u2019s current predicament is user-generated.\n\nAs BuzzFeed\u2018s Ryan Broderick reports, major subreddits were suddenly rendered private by their moderators on Thursday night. That\u2019s because Reddit fired Victoria Taylor, who\u2019s popularly known on the site as u/chooter. Taylor, who worked as Reddit\u2019s director of communications, helped the r/IAMA subreddit \u2014 which has conducted incredibly popular Q&A\u2019s with presidents and criminals alike.\n\nAs moderator \u201ckarmanaut\u201d explains, \u201cwe learned that Victoria was unexpectedly let go from her position with Reddt. We all had the rug ripped out from under us and feel betrayed.\u201d No particular reason was given for Taylor\u2019s termination, and while such information is relevant only to Reddit\u2019s in-house staff, that it happened so abruptly and without any communicated warning to the r/IAMA mods is what pissed off karmanaut.\n\nSo they made r/IAMA private, rendering it unreadable to all but a few users. To make matters worse, several other popular subreddits followed suit.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Redditors assumed Taylor\u2019s firing was another unpopular part of interim CEO Ellen Pao\u2018s plan, so they filed a Change.org petition calling for her resignation. As of this writing, it has 15,750 signatures of the required 25,000.\n\nMeanwhile, Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian \u2014 another target of angry Redditors \u2014 hasn\u2019t done much to alleviate the situation. If anything, he\u2019s made it worse:\n\nReddit founder Alexis Ohanian last night in response to the drama surrounding r/IAmA: \u201cPopcorn tastes good.\u201d pic.twitter.com/lBsbV0kNS0 \u2014 Ryan Broderick (@broderick) July 3, 2015\n\nHe tried to make up for his comments later, but to no avail:\n\n\u201cI made two dumb joke comments in SRD, which I admit were dumb,\u201d Ohanian wrote this morning about his popcorn post pic.twitter.com/PCORArlvKr \u2014 Ryan Broderick (@broderick) July 3, 2015\n\nMeanwhile, behind the scenes, Ohanian and the Reddit administration are trying to lay down the law with the r/IAMA mods:\n\nOhanian in apparently private post on r/modtalk: \u201cGet the blacked out subreddits back online\u201d https://t.co/BSLPjVutOm pic.twitter.com/HK3lO8muJh \u2014 Ryan Broderick (@broderick) July 3, 2015\n\nSo yeah. Reddit has, for the most part, gone dark. Internet content writers like myself, as well as those of you who read it while wasting time at work, are supposedly struggling to find things to write about. (Honestly, we\u2019re doing just fine.) But if you really want a alternative time-suck to Reddit, you\u2019re not alone. \u201cReddit alternative\u201d is trending on Google in a big way.\n\n[h/t BuzzFeed]\n\n[Image via Reddit]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\n>> Follow Andrew Husband (@AndrewHusband) on Twitter\n\nHave a tip we should know?
