    "text": "The Pleasures of Rooting Against Brazil\n\nNo team has ever acted so entitled to World Cup glory.\n\nJune 11, 2014\n\nMy maternal grandfather came this close to playing professional soccer: When he was just weeks away from being selected as part of the elite squad for Mexico's Club Am\u00e9rica, his father told him it was time to choose\u2014either pursue his lifelong dream of becoming a winger or settle for the much more acceptable path of studying medicine and hanging up the cleats for good.\n\nIn a decision that he would regret for the rest of his life, he chose to become a cardiologist. In order to mend his own broken, soccer-yearning heart, my grandfather then became a soccer savant. I kid you not: he could predict the outcome of a game just by looking at each team\u2019s formation. He knew every player\u2019s weakness so well that he could have been a fantastic scout. But most of all he appreciated the rituals of the game.\n\nWhich brings me to the art of hating the opposition.\n\nIt must have been 1983. My grandfather\u2019s beloved Am\u00e9rica was playing Guadalajara, the Mexican cl\u00e1sico. Even though my sympathies lay elsewhere (with the long-suffering Cruz Azul), my grandfather bought a couple of tickets and took me to the game. When we had reached our seats high up in the mouth of the gigantic Estadio Azteca, he looked at the field below us. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I asked. \u201cLooking for the referee and for Quirarte,\u201d said my grandfather, referring to Fernando Quirarte, Guadalajara's fierce captain (nicknamed \u201cEl Sheriff\u201d). It took him five seconds to locate them both. And then he did something I had never seen before in this stoic, rather reserved man. He let out two thunderous, fantastically vulgar shouts: \u201cChinga tu madre!\u201d (which translates, basically, as \u201cgo fuck your mother!\u201d). He then looked at me and, upon noticing my surprise (and delight), immediately remarked: \u201cIn football, passion for those you like is equally important as passion against those you really dislike.\u201d He then sat down and asked for beer.\n\nMy grandfather was right: There are very few things as enjoyable as hating another soccer team and everything it stands for. Because it ends up being (mostly) harmless yet poignant, hate derived from soccer\u2014be it from a legendary rivalry, a personal grudge or any other reason\u2014is the best kind of hate. It might actually be the only acceptable kind of hate.\n\nI have a long list of soccer antipathies. I dislike Spain's Real Madrid, Am\u00e9rica, Argentina\u2019s River Plate, and many others. All have a common denominator: every one of these teams believe they are entitled to glory; they enter the field with the firm belief that, be it by divine intervention or real talent, victory will be theirs in the end. You might say I resent winners, but that\u2019s not it. What I resent are teams who believe winning is their exclusive privilege before the referee (chinga tu madre!) has even started the game.\n\nEnter Brazil, kings of entitlement.\n\nUp to this day, Brazilians believe that the FIFA World Cup is their right, their privilege by virtue of a beautiful canary yellow shirt. They\u2019ve thought so at least since the early 1950\u2019s. Not even the most dramatic and embarrassing defeat in the history of soccer convinced them otherwise. Back then, though, Brazil\u2019s sense of purpose was not hubristic: it was virtuoso determination. And it came, at least back then, with a sense not only of humility but also of an undeniable enjoyment. From 1950 until at least 1970, the Brazilians enjoyed a couple of decades of street-wise, joyous soccer, in which winning was important (of course it was) but was far from the only thing that mattered.\n\nAnd then something happened.\n\nBrazil slowly abandoned all those virtues, opting away from the sublime. The last hurrah came in 1982, when it had the audacity of playing at least four creative geniuses in what was, in my opinion, the most amazing national team ever to play the game. They played with almost sexual grace\u2026but still they lost, eliminated by Italy in a bizarre match. Brazilians learned all the wrong lessons from that terrible day. The creative bliss of Pele, S\u00f3crates, Falcao and Garrincha was replaced by the ruthless destructive prowess of Dunga and Mauro Silva. The jogo bonito became the jogo pragmatico. In the process, Brazil sacrificed every single endearing quality and\u2014at least for me\u2014became the yellow kings of arrogance.\n\nThe 2014 Brazilian squad wears that particular crown with ease.\n\nThe elegant talent of Zico and Eder has been replaced by the robotic muteness of Hulk or the overestimated antics of Neymar, a sort of puffed up Woody-Woodpecker. Even Brazilian extravagance has lost its class: Where before roamed Romario\u2014beautifully defined by Jorge Valdano as a \u201cfootballer straight out of an animated cartoon\u201d\u2014now one can find Fred, who has the charisma of a chloroform soaked rag. And there\u2019s more. This Brazil can become violent in an instant. The rough game (the antifutbol) was never part of the Brazilian repertoire. It is now and it has been for a while (ask Tab Ramos if he remembers Leonardo\u2019s elbow). In the 2014 squad, even Neymar carries an axe. This is far from a joyful team.\n\nIt is, actually, Brazil at its most pedantic. Gone are the days of humility and street smarts. This is the Brazil of Oscar modeling Calvin Klein underwear and Marcelo and Thiago Silva carrying expensive suitcases in another ad for TAM airlines. They look like models or savvy entrepreneurs rather than ambassadors for the country where showmanship and style once mattered more than the golden cup. And they think they\u2019ve got it made. Just like in 1950, the Brazilians feel they deserve the trophy even before the brazuca has started rolling. They have it all planned out, down to the final against Messi\u2019s Argentina. The party, you see, is all but ready. That\u2019s why I really want them to lose. In honor of my grandfather, who taught me how to profoundly and merrily dislike a team, I hope the ghost of Maracan\u00e1 strikes once more. This canarinha deserves a banho de humildade.\n\nLeon Krauze, a Mexican journalist and writer, anchors Univision\u2019s evening newscasts in Los Angeles, hosts Open Source on Fusion, and is the former official historian for the Mexican national team."
