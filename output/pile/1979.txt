    "text": "The Progressive Democrat Newsletter grew out of the frustration of the 2004 election. Originally intended for New York City progressives, its readership is now national. For anyone who wants to be alerted by email whenever this newsletter is updated (usually weekly), please send your email address and let me know what state you live in (so I can keep track of my readership).\n\nSunday, March 06, 2011\n\nProgressive Democrat Newsletter Issue 291\n\nThe anti-union, pro-billionaire Teabagger Republicans have stimulated a backlash that has raised more than $500,000 for the Wisconsin Democratic State Senate Committee. Which is WONDERFUL. Mostly in $14 increments (in honor of the 14 Democratic State Senators who stood up to pro-billionaire, anti-working class Walker) we have raised more than half a million dollars for the next State Senate elections! THAT may be one of the most important results of the last couple of weeks. But I want to call people's attention to the Wisconsin State Assembly, which Democrats used to control but is now a Teabagger/Republican body. We need to win the Wisconsin Assembly as well as the Wisconsin State Senate. I urge people to donate $14 to the Assembly fund as well as $14 to the State senate fund. If we raised over $500,000 for each, we'd be really well positioned to hand the Teabagger Republicans their collective ass in the next election. Please click here and donate $14 to each. Believe me, you will be thrilled next time you watch an election in Wisconsin if enough of us take this one little action.\n\nBut the fight has moved on beyond Wisconsin. It is being fought in Ohio and Indiana as well. Over at Daily Kos some have been complaining that Ohio and Indiana have been ignored. Well, as you will see on this Act Blue Page and in this week's newsletter, I have been focusing on Ohio and Indiana as well, and I urge you to donate to those efforts as well. Might as well keep $14 as the iconic pro-union donation. Just give LOTS of $14 donations if you can."
