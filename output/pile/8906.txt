    "text": "Unfortunately for the people of the world everything is going according to the New World Order Plan. But what is this New World Order Plan? In a nutshell the Plan is this. The Dark Agenda of the secret planners of the New World Order is to reduce the world's population to a \"sustainable\" level \"in perpetual balance with nature\" by a ruthless Population Control Agenda via Population and Reproduction Control. A Mass Culling of the People via Planned Parenthood, toxic adulteration of water and food supplies, release of weaponised man-made viruses, man-made pandemics, mass vaccination campaigns and a planned Third World War. Then, the Dark Agenda will impose upon the drastically reduced world population a global feudal-fascist state with a World Government, World Religion, World Army, World Central Bank, World Currency and a micro-chipped population. In short, to kill 90% of the world's population and to control all aspects of the human condition and thus rule everyone, everywhere from the cradle to the grave.\n\nBritish-Israelism (also called Anglo-Israelism) is a composite of religious doctrines, first elaborated in 18th century England, whose common theme is that some ancient British people and/or royal lineages are direct lineal descendants of some of the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel. Thus, British-Israelism was founded upon the claim that the English Anglo-Saxons were one of the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel. Moreover that the British monarch was the direct descendant of King David, were of the Davidic Bloodline, and so, heir to\"the throne of King David.\"In short, the British were the true Israelites and therefore\"God's Chosen People.\"Moreover, by extension, that the Israelites of the Bible are not the modern Jews, but, rather, today's Anglo-Saxons. These belies have spawned the Christian Identity movement.\n\nBritish-Israelism relies upon the belief that large numbers of the Ten Tribes of Israel living in the Northern Kingdom of Israel were deported by Sargon, king of Assyria, on the fall of its capitol, Samaria, to him in 721 BC (2 Kings 17:5). After the downfall of the Northern Kingdom, the people were transported wholesale by the conqueror causing a massive depopulationof the land such that:\n\n\"... the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Avva, and from Hamath and Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel; and they possessed Samaria, and dwelt in the cities thereof\"(2 Kings 17:24).\n\nThus, the Northern Kingdom of Israel was conquered its people removed and replaced by non-Israelites: that is, the depopulation and re-population of Samaria. That during various episodes of deportation and re-population in connection with the subjugation of the Northern Kingdom the Ten Northern Tribes of Israel were taken into captivity, to Assyria, and subsequently lost to history; and so, become known asthe Ten Lost Tribes of Israel.\n\nHowever, although lost to the historian, the belief that the Ten Lost Tribes were distinct and maintained their identity after the Assyrian captivity is an old idea appearing in various ancient sources. For instance, in the second century BC in the apocryphal Book of Tobit whose eponymous hero is a member of the tribe of Naphtali, \"who in the days of Shalmaneser, king of the Assyrians, was taken into captivity from Thisbe.\" And, in the pseudepigraphal 2 Baruch, produced in the latter half of the first century AD in which the author claims to be Baruch, the secretary of Jeremiah (Jer. 36:4) and begins a letter \"to the nine and a half tribes, which were across the river Euphrates.\" And also the apocryphal work 2 Esdras from the same period in which:\n\n\"These are the ten tribes which were led away from their own land into captivity in the days of King Hoshea, whom Shalmaneser the king of the Assyrians led captive; he took them across the river, and they were taken into another land. But they formed this plan ... that they would ... go to a more distant region, where mankind had never lived ... [to] Azareth.\"\n\nAnd even Josephus (1st century AD) mentions the Ten Tribes in his Antiquities:\n\n\"Wherefore there are but two tribes in Asia and Europe subject to the Romans, while the ten tribes are beyond the Euphrates till now, and are an immense multitude, and not to be estimated by numbers\"\n\nEven Jerome (347-420), one of the great fathers of the early Christian Church writing in the fifth century AD, believed the Ten Tribes were still in the land of their captivity.\n\nHowever. the first public appearance of the theory of the glorious heritage, which belongs to the British, emerged in the 1700s during the religious climate of Millenarianism and especially in the preaching and writings of two men, Richard Brothers (1757-1824) and John Wilson (1788-1870) In 1793, Richard Brothers declared himself the\"revealed Prince and Prophet\" of The Lost Ten Tribes of Israel, the lost\"Jews\" who were hidden amongst the population of Great Britain. Brothers let it be known that he was the apostle of a new religion and his special role was the gathering of the \"Jews\" back into the Promised Land of Israel. Moreover, that the \"hidden Israel\" settled amidst the other pagan tribes of Europe were the true Biblical \"Jews\" lost to history. And, since they had no notion of their cherished lineage, it was his special role to make it known to them and then lead them back to the land of Canaan. In fact, the mentally unstable Brothers not only proclaimed himself to be \"Prince of the Hebrews\" and so the literal descendant of the Biblical House of David but also the \"Nephew of the Almighty\" -\"Ruler of the world\"- who would rule over Israel until the return of Jesus Christ. All done, said Brothers, using a rod fashioned from a wild rosebush with which he would perform miracles similar to those Moses had performed. It was from this inauspicious start that arose the powerful modern British-Israel Movement.\n\nWhereas Brothers could claim to be the first in print it was Rev. John Wilson's Lectures onOur Israelitish Origins (1840) underpinned by Scripture, historiography, logic and reason that put British-Israelism on firmer footing. Wilson seemingly established the Israelitish origin of the Anglo-Saxons bytracing the migrations of the peoples of Israel as they made their way across the continent of Europe to the British Isles. Wilson's hypothesis was that The Lost Ten Tribes of Israel taken captive by the Assyrians in the 721 BC had migrated north and west and had been assimilated into the pagan cultures of Europe and especially the Anglo-Saxons that settled in Britain. Consequently, Great Britain is the geographical home of The Lost Ten Tribes of Israel and thepeople of Anglo-Saxon descent are heirs of the Covenant Promises made to Israel by Yahweh in the Old Testament. Thus, according to Wilson and his followers, British-Israelisms affirms both the proper identification of The Lost Ten Tribes of Israel and proper application of biblical prophecy as directed to Anglo-Saxons specifically. Thus, its Anglo-Saxon advocates established a unique relationship with Yahweh and, therefore, the British people became the world's elite and in receipt of the rewards and privileges associated with this lofty status vis-\u00e0-vis a World Empire.\n\nWilson's successor was Edward Hine (1825-91) who enthusiastically took up the cause claiming to have addressed five million people on this theory during his lecture-circuit career in Britain and in the United States. Hine wrote Forty-Seven Identifications of the British Nation With Lost Israel (1871) and edited a magazine called The Banner of Israelin which he introduced one of his most important teachings was pyramidism: the belief in a divine source behind the construction of the Great Pyramids of Egypt with its own superior form of measurement. Moreover, Hine believed that the future can be revealed if these superior measurements of the inner tunnels of the Great Pyramid of Giza are correctly interpreted. Thus, Hine introduced sacred geometry and superior mathematics of the pyramids into the romance of British-Israelism. His theory of pyramidism was eagerly taken up by others in the British-Israel Movement who also viewed the pyramids and their sacred geometry as a tool whereby God's Will for the future could be discerned. Hence:\n\n\"... the region in which granite reappears, after being wholly absent for an interval of near 2,900 inches [represents] the years during which the two houses of Israel and Judah have remained separate...\" Jane Simpson: The Journal of the British-Israel Association (July 1907)\n\nThis, then, is the romance of the Ten Northern Tribes of Israel, apparently lost from the pages of history, which in a nutshell is this: that the Anglo-Saxons are the physical descendants of the Israelites and that Great Britain with her daughter the United States of America has inherited all the Covenant Blessings given to Abraham by Yahweh. That, these two English-speaking nations that changed the world are the two nations who are in receipt of Yahweh's commitments to Abraham and his descendants (Gen. 12:1-3; 17:5). Moreover, that persuasive mass of Biblical passages, ancient texts, linguistics arguments, pyramidism and legends are offered as proof of the theory. Theologically, the movement did not regard its esoteric truths as incompatible with the established denominations and so never regarded itself as a cult or sect and so never took sectarian form. However, lacking hierarchy and an organisational centre, the movement's disparate threads and characters inevitably developed increasingly fantastic ideological and theological scenarios unchecked by any recognised centre of Christian orthodoxy. And, this enthusiasm for the theory was seen especially in America.\n\nBritish-Israelism was a theory and movement that, in Britain, peaked in the 1920s and has been in decline ever since, but, one that found fertile ground in America in the Depression Era of the 1930s. Howard B Rand (1889-1991) founded the Anglo-Saxon Federation of America in 1930 with the help of Wesley Swift who later founded his own church, called the Church of Jesus Christ Christian, which developed into the Aryan Nations. These two men laid the foundations of the so-called Christian Identity Movement or simply the Identity Movement. This was a logical extension of the theory propounded first by the British that they were the true Israelites and so true heirs of the Abrahamic Covenant.\n\nRand and Swift argued that if this was the case then the modern Jew's claim to the Covenant was false. From this arose the doctrines of a modern movement that opposed the claim ofmodern Jews to everything pertaining to Biblical Promisesgiven by Yahweh to the Ancient Israelites. This movement became increasingly defined by this claim and by its intrinsic racial argument. Critics of British-Israelism argue that not only is it a false doctrine its tenets are not without peril with its most patent danger being the ease with which it appears to justify and foster racial pride and racial prejudice vis-\u00e0-vis the supposed supremacy of the Anglo-Saxon race as proof that they are The Lost Ten Tribes of Israel andYahweh's \"chosen people.\" Hence, the central thesis of Christian Identity is that whites, not modern Jews, are the true Biblical Israelites favoured by Yahweh.\n\nIts more zealous adherents also argue that modern Jews are biologically descended from Satan, while non-whites are soulless\"mud people\"created with the other Biblical\"beasts of the field.\"In short: the bitter critics of the Christian Identity Movement accuse it not only of sophistry but also of latent racism and crude \"anti-Semitism.\" Thus, these critics claim, with the advent of the North American form ofBritish-Israelism as taught by Brand and his creed \"anti-Semitic teachings\" and an exclusionary hatred claimed legitimacy for the first time in the movement's history. Thus, critics argue that although Christian Identity roots are in the 19th century British-Israelism, a theory which was initially friendly to Jews, but was adopted and transformed in the 20th century by a number of \"racist preachers\" in the United States into a rabidly anti-Semitic creed. Furthermore, that the Identity Theory has been one of the most important ideologies underpinning the so-called White Supremacist Movement, which in the crudest form is this: Christ will only return to Earth when it is racially cleansed of Jews. A doctrine described by W A Redding in his book, The Millennial Kingdom: A Book of Surprises (1894)\n\n\"I shall therefore take a shorter route through the subject by calling your attention to some facts, as they exist, which will convince you, without history, that the Anglo-Saxons are the Lost Ten Tribes of Israel. Go over the earth and collect together all the Anglo-Saxon people and put them in a bunch to themselves; then collect together all the other races of people, such as the Chinese, Japanese, Egyptians, Hindoos, Malays, Negroes, Indians, Arabians and many other kinds of human beings, and put them all together in a bunch to themselves. Then compare the one congregation with the other. In the Anglo-Saxon bunch you will see high foreheads, long, slim, intellectual noses, brilliant eyes, fine texture of the skin, well-proportioned physical frames and fine, smooth hair. Turn to the other group of races. There you will see the low, flat foreheads, heavy, short, thick noses, vicious eyes, coarse hair, and uncomely features.\"\n\nAnd on the question of the Jew:\n\n\"God designated one part as Israel and the other part as Judah, and this part called Judah are the Jews we see on our streets to-day, and we can pick them out by their looks, as the Bible tells us that God marked their faces so we can tell them anywhere, so that they can be persecuted for killing Christ.\"\n\nBritish-Israelism can thus lead to its adherents to teach, at least by implication, Salvation by Race as well as by Grace.\n\nBritish-Israelism was originally not an \"anti-Semitic\" doctrine since its advocates typically viewed the modern Jews as legitimate descendants of Israel together with the Anglo-Saxon peoples. Moreover, today not all British-Israelites today are \"anti-Semitic,\" nor are they all part of the Christian Identity Movement."
