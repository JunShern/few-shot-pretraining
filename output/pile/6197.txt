More precisely, is there a way to have three possible states for each checkbox : checked, unchecked, undefined (in most GUIs this is represented as a full square).\nAlternatively, do you recommend another control that would meet these needs ?\nUPDATE : Ok, given that HTML does not support tri-state checkboxes, I'm looking for a way to 'CSS' (color fill, highlight, etc...) the checkboxes of the items that are in that 'undefined' state from my server point of view. \n\nA:\n\nNot all GUIs represent undefined as a full square. That's why it's going to be clearer to use one of the following:\n1. Radio boxes\n2. Dropdown\n3. ListBox \n\nA:\n\nI have decided to use CheckBoxList anyway, since I need two states accessible by the user, and a third one not accessible by the user but to display inconsistencies. \nThe way I have solved this is through Javascript + CSS.
