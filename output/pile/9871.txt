    "text": "...\n\nFruit machines: The most popular online slots in the world\n\nThe joy of playing online slots at sites such as BetVictor Casino, is that there are so many options to choose from. As slots and game developers have evolved, the choices have grown to include 3D slots, slots based on popular movies and bands, horror slots, slots based on sports, history, and so much more.\n\nOne of the most popular choices throughout the ages has always been fruit machine slots. But what makes fruit machine slots so popular and why should you try them for yourself?\n\nFruit Machine History\n\nThe first slot machine was created by Charles Fey in the 19th century and featured playing cards and the Liberty Bell as the symbols. This soon evolved into fruit symbols and became the norm for new slots.\n\nFor most of these original fruit machine slots, the payouts weren\u2019t cash, but fruit-flavoured gum. The flavour of gum you won was dependant on the fruit symbols you landed during your win. Three cherry symbols meant cherry-flavoured gum. Due to this strange form of payment, pubs were able to keep the machines on the property by stating that the fruit machines were actually gum dispensers.\n\nAs the games became more and more popular, different candies and drinks were added to the payout system which eventually evolved into cash.\n\nCasino Games for All\n\nWhen the first land-based casinos were opened in the 1940s, fruit machines were one of the main attractions on the floor. Easy to play, affordable, and alluring, fruit machines had everything that a casual casino player wanted.\n\nDue to their popularity and the increase in player demand, new fruit machines were quickly developed and released.\n\nImprovements were made to the machines on the floor and new games were released that simply sky-rocketed the joy that players received from these simple slots. These original games are now referred to as Traditional Slots and many punters today still enjoy playing them. These casino games can still be found at land-based casinos and many of them have been recreated for the online space.\n\nOnline slots are now growing in popularity every year as they evolve and change to suit the needs and wants of the players. Online slots, including fruit machines, also offer players even more ways to play and even bigger payouts.\n\nOne of the main advantages of playing online fruit machines is that most are available to play via mobile. That means it\u2019s possible to spin the reels of a fruity slot no matter where you might find yourself. In the age of the internet and smartphones, convenience is definitely key.\n\nWhile fruit machine slots still hold a special place in many player\u2019s hearts around the world, it\u2019s newer slots that are now taking the lead. New features such as 243 ways to win, expanding symbols, and out of this world graphics are all fantastic additions to modern slots, but the fact is that fruit machines will always be the original creations.\n\nFruit Machines for You\n\nIf you\u2019re keen to give fruit machine slots a try, there are hundreds on the market for you to experience. If you\u2019ve never tried a fruit machine before, you\u2019ll quickly get into the swing of things thanks to the simple gameplay.\n\nUSEFUL LINKS\n\nYes, I wantFree Spins, Exclusive Bonuses, Free Tips and News.\n\nWhy CasinoTopsOnline.com\n\nWith a burning love for online casinos we strive to improve the industry for your comfort.
