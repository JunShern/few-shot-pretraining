    "text": "1. British Archaeology and the Bell Beaker\n\nBritish archaeologists have long been aware of a late prehistoric artifact culture found across the British Isles, and across large areas of Western Europe. It bridged the Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age periods around 4,400 to 3,800 years ago. It was characterised by the use of fine bell-shaped beaker pots, usually red ceramic fabric, heavily decorated with simple motifs. These motifs were characteristically impressed with a fine toothed comb or dentated spatula. Many Bell beaker burial rituals have been excavated and studied. The inhumed body would usually be crouched on the side, roughly on a north to south alignment. A bell beaker would often be stood near to the body, at the feet, or near the head. Other grave goods often included barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, flint flakes and blades, antler picks, sometimes one or two more beakers, amber beads, copper awls, and gold earrings / hair rings. 64% of British Beaker burials were flat graves, but sometimes a barrow or cist would be erected above it (Beaker Pottery of Great Britain & Ireland. DL Clarke. CUP 1970).\n\nAbove, a flint barbed & tanged arrowhead of the Beaker Culture, that I found and recorded during a surface collection survey some years ago.\n\nArchaeologists studying the artifact culture in Britain, compared the British finds to those on the Continent in order to try to find an origin for these people. They suggested either Brittany in North West France, or the Lower Rhine Valley, in the Netherlands and Northern Germany. Some alternatively promoted Iberia as the origin.\n\nThen British Archaeology entered an intellectual phase where it became fashionable to dismiss migration or invasions of people, in favour of cultural exchange. Pots not People. Rather like today, we British wear denim, t-shirts, listen to R&B, and drink coke. However, we have not been displaced by North Americans - we just absorbed the artifacts of another culture. From the 1970s on, many late prehistoric migrations were dismissed by British archaeologists as cultural exchanges rather than representing population displacement.\n\n2. The New Population Genetics and the Steppe Pastoralists.\n\nA new field of study has been gathering pace with the arrival of the 21st Century, that uses genetic evidence, to explore past migrations, movements, admixtures, and origins of peoples. The earliest pioneers used blood types, then mitochondrial DNA mutations, followed by STR of Y-DNA. Some of the early conclusions supported the new orthodoxy of British Archaeology. Stephen Oppenheimer's infamous publication \"The Origins of the British\" championed that there had been little change in British populations since the Ice Age. They were to be proven wrong. Early conclusions, based on little evidence, misunderstandings that were later corrected with more data, seriously damaged the reputation of population genetics in British prehistoric studies.\n\nThe most common Y-DNA haplogroup of Western Europe, particularly of Ireland and Britain was R1b. Early mistakes gave this male haplogroup an Ice Age origin of the Basque Region in Southwest Europe. As more data gathered, and debate developed, it became apparent that the origin was not the Basque region, but the Pontic and Caspian Steppes of Eurasia! It became associated with an archaeological culture in Southern Russia called the Yamna. The R1b and R1a haplogroups appeared to have spilled off the Steppes into Europe during the Copper Age during a significant migration event around 4,900 - 4,600 years ago. In Eastern and Central Europe, this migration of pastoralists appears to be responsible for the fused artifact culture known as the Corded Ware (again, after a prehistoric pottery style).\n\nA few lectures on Youtube to watch:\n\nHavard lecture by David Reich 2015.\n\nCARTA lecture by Johannes Krause 2016\n\nThat brings us up to date. In summary, population geneticists have discovered a movement of people, not just pots, from the Steppes into Europe. Modern Europeans descend from an admixture of three major founder populations: 1) the Western Eurasian hunter-gatherers, then a layer of 2) Early Neolithic farmers (that originated in Anatolia and the Middle East), and finally, 3) the Steppe Pastoralists. The actual mix varies not only from person to person, but also regionally across Europe.\n\nSo how does the Bell Beaker Culture of Britain and Western Europe fit into all of this? The strong assumption over the past couple of years was that the diffusion of R1b Y-DNA haplogroups occurred then, so therefore, it was a simple extension of this westward drift across Europe that originated on the Pontic and Caspian Steppes. It first spawned the Corded Ware Culture in Central Europe, but then when it met Western Europe, spawned the Bell Beaker Culture. However, until now, this hypothesis hadn't been tested.\n\nThe Beaker phenomenon and genetic transformation of Northwest Europe 2017\n\nHas now examined some of these questions, through the examination of an unprecedented scale of ancient DNA sampling. The link to their published document (which is still awaiting peer review) is at the top of this post, and I'd invite others to read it for themselves. An article covering the document can also be read on the Scientific American. However, I personally with my layman head take five suggestions from the study.\n\nThey found that the DNA of human remains on Continental Europe did not suggest one cohesive or homogeneous population. There was in this case, evidence of cultural diffusion. Different peoples were taking on the Bell Beaker artifact assemblage in Western Europe. Pots rather more than people. This was a great surprise, as we still know from the earlier study, that much of our DNA and Y-DNA in particular, originated around 400 years earlier from the Eurasian Steppes. However, although the Central European Corded Ware Culture does still appear to have been a response to that great influx of new people from the Steppes, the picture with the Western European Bell Beaker is more complex.\n\nAn exception was Britain. Here, the remains associated with Bell Beaker Culture were all one population, and they were very different to the earlier Neolithic population of Britain. It appears to have been a case of population displacement. They suggest at least 90% displacement! It means that very few or none of our Neolithic ancestors built the amazing monuments of Neolithic Britain. They were built by earlier peoples, that our ancestors displaced.\n\nThey confirm a Lower Rhine origin as most likely for the British Beaker People. The ancient DNA that most closely matched British Beaker DNA, came from Beaker human remains in the Netherlands and Northern Germany. This correlates nicely with the 1970 archaeological study mentioned above.\n\nIt's confirmed. Previous to their entry into the British Isles, there is no evidence of any Steppe ancestry, no Steppe autosomal DNA, no Steppe Y haplogroups such as R1b-L21 here. (Nor any mtDNA haplogroup H6a1). The Beaker people from the Lower Rhine, brought the initial layers of this DNA to Britain. The founder population were admixed, but with significant percentages of Steppe ancestry, particularly on Y lines.\n\nThe previous Neolithic Farmer population were mainly Y haplogroup I2, and appear to have descended mainly from populations in the South, from Iberia, rather than from the Danube, although before that from Anatolia. The modern population that is closest to them today are Sardinians.\n\nAlso as a layman, I guess that this suggests that most, or even any \"Neolithic Farmer\" DNA suggested by our ancient ancestry calculators, was most likely picked up elsewhere than Britain, and brought here by later migrants (descended through that mixture of cultural diffusion and admixture), rather than directly from the British Neolithic population.\n\nI also notice a correlation with an Irish study last year (\"Neolithic and Bronze Age migration to Ireland and\nestablishment of the insular Atlantic genome\" Cassidy etal. Queens University Belfast 2016), that again, suggested major displacement of earlier peoples in Ireland, at the end of the Neolithic, by a population with largely Steppes origins.\n\nTags\n\nToday... I managed my first visit to the Flag Fen \"archaeology park\", for maybe nine or ten years. This park was inspired by a number of finds here, lead by Francis Pryor. Pryor and his team excavated prior to cable and pipework laying for a new gas fired power station at Peterborough. They found a large number of well preserved (in the moist peat soils) felled and cut timbers, that using dendrochronological methods, they dated to between 1400 BC and 900 BC, during the mid to late British Bronze Age.\n\nThey created this wetland, or recreated it, in order to conserve and preserve the archaeology that the excavation revealed. To keep it wet. The Fens are an area of Wetlands that have been increasingly drained over the centuries. The concern is that timber archaeology like that found on this site, is quickly perishing now.\n\nThese shears were found with their preserved wooden case here. Flag Fen was a timber palisade, that crossed a flooded area, with a wooden platform in the middle of the new lake. This platform was surrounded with lots of deposits, many in bronze - swords, axes, blades, etc. Many of these tools had been snapped or damaged. The excavator suggested that this was ritual. Removing sacrifices from the world, to that mirror world below the water. It revokes the Arthurian tale of the Lady and the Sword.\n\nYamna theorists should love this one. As far as I know, the earliest dated actual wheel found in the British Isles. Okay, we know they were around longer - but this wooden wheel dates to 3,000 years ago.\n\nA reconstructed, and aged ... Bronze Age British roundhouse. I'm not sure though if roundhouses have been dated to the Bronze Age. Certainly a feature of the Iron Age - the roundhouse was strong enough to resist British weather. The lower photo shows it in it's wetland Fennish environment.\n\nSome of the preserved (using constant water sprays) timbers of the palisade leading onto the platform. The opposite wall displays an artist's impression of the timbers above water level. Pryor suggested that with rising sea levels threatening the rich pastures, that Bronze Age farmers here constructed this platform in order to make scarifices and to perform rituals, to try to control the flooding, to turn back the rise in water levels, and maybe at the same time, to celebrate that life above water, and life below water - as in life and death, a mirror.\n\nArtists impression.\n\nSome of the artifact finds.\n\nMore artifacts, including bronze axe handles.\n\nA reconstructed Bronze Age axe composite.\n\nAnyone that has ever read archaeologist Francis Pryor's reports, will know that he is very keen to relate prehistoric archaeology to farming. Here, a soay lamb rests in the Sun. They keep a flock here as closest-to-period sheep that the Bronze Age farmers most likely bred here.\n\nWhen I visited this park many years ago, they were busy trying to preserve the timbers of the Sea Henge, excavated on the North Norfolk Coast. Those timbers have successfully been preserved, and are now locally in Kings Lynn Museum:\n\nPhoto taken by myself at Kings Lynn in 2008.\n\nCurrently though, they are hosting the preserved timbers of a number of finds from another Cambridgeshire wetland excavation - from Must Hill Farm. The above photos were taken during the excavation that recovered a number of log boats dated to the Bronze Age (from 1,500 BC) through to the Iron Age. These log boats were clearly made using bronze axes like those above. A large number of well preserved eel nets were also excavated, suggesting that fishing was important to this Bronze Age community.\n\nI hope that some of you enjoy sharing my photo tour from today, especially those that share ancestors here, but live far away today.\n\nTags\n\nImage above, last year, holding an artifact from the Neolithic Tomb of the Sea Eagles in Orkney.\n\nToday in this post, I am celebrating my Neolithic heritage. Another ancestral genetics enthusiast pointed out that rather than Anglo-Saxon, for a Brit and North West European, I actually had indications of enhanced Neolithic Farmer ancestry on most ancient DNA calculators (more on that below). I was actually quite pleased to have that pointed out, and this post explains why I love the idea of being a modern Neolithic Man.\n\nI remember being fascinated by the past as quite a young child. On holidays across the British isles, I craved nothing more than visits to castles. At home in Norwich, I'd haunt the local museums. However, a love of the Neolithic took hold during my twenties. First, a fishing and drinking tour of Ireland with my brother, took me to the Newgrange Passage Grave site in the Boyne Valley. Awesome impact. Then several years later, I picked up the broken butt end of a Neolithic polished flint axe head on farmland behind my cottage.\n\nThe above photo is an image of another broken Neolithic flint axe head that I recorded during a surface collection survey many years later in Thetford Forest.\n\nThis eventually pulled me into a phase of looking for more prehistoric flint, which I later formalised into the Thetford Forest Survey. During that period, in collaboration with the Forestry Commission, Norfolk Archaeology, and Suffolk Archaeology, I recorded thousands of struck flint and ceramic artifacts - many from the Neolithic.\n\nAbove image taken at the Castlerigg Stone Circle in Cumbria in 2006.\n\nAny chance that I got, I'd also visit Neolithic sites across the British Isles - and continue to do so, hence last year I had a cycling tour of many late prehistoric sites in Orkney. Absolutely love the Neolithic. Even though an atheist, I have to confess that some of these sites give me a special vibe. I have half-seriously told neo-pagan friends, that If I had to choose some gods, Then maybe they would be those of the Neolithic. Something about the remote sites.\n\nOur New Understanding of the Neolithic of Europe\n\nWhat I really want to write about here though, is how recent population genetics, over the past ten years, is transforming how we see the Western Eurasian Neolithic. Archaeologists had long pondered, our relationship to the British Neolithic people, and going further back and in turn - their relationship to the earlier Mesolithic hunter-foragers of the British Isles.\n\nWhat recent research of both ancient and modern DNA has so far revealed is that after the last Ice Age, hunter-foragers moved up to Britain from Southern Europe. Meanwhile, new cultures and economies were developing in the Middle East of SW Asia. Across the Fertile Crescent, that ran up the Levant, East Anatolia, eastwards, then down the fertile valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates river valleys - people started to settle, domesticate wheat, barley, goats, sheep, cattle and pigs. They started to farm for the very first time. This was the Neolithic Revolution. The first fired ceramics - pottery was added to the recipe, along with polished stone tools. Eventually these populations also absorbed the very first metallurgy, literacy, and town building - falling into the southern half of those river valleys in Mesopotamia.\n\nImage above - Standing Stone at Stillaig, Argyll, Scotland.\n\nFrom the Levant and Anatolia, both along the Mediterranean, and direct across the Balkans by land, Neolithic culture and farming technology spread westwards and northwards across Europe. Population genetics now tells us that this WAS carried by people. It was not just a transfer of culture and artifacts. DNA from South-West Asia was strongly carried across Europe. The Neolithic farmers were a people, with roots in the Near East.\n\nWhat happened to the old European hunter-foragers? It seems a mixture of displacement and admixture. As the Neolithic Revolution rolled across Europe, it did pick up some hunter-gatherer DNA. However, few of the male haplogroups. By the time that the First Farmers reached the British Isles, they would have had an ancestry mixed between Near East Asian and European hunters. Without a doubt, brides and perhaps slaves were taken along that long route from Anatolia to Britain. This pattern perhaps continued when they reached the Irish and British Isles, and confronted some of the last hunter-gatherer populations of North West Europe.\n\nImage above. Ring of Brodgar, Orkney.\n\nAll of this was fine. The British Isles were settled by Neolithic peoples around 4,100 BC. I've seen many of their monuments, studied excavation reports of their archaeological sites, and held many of their flint artifacts. It was a dominant culture here for two thousand years. Religious systems may have come and go. They erected so many monuments here that still survive. Causewayed enclosures, long barrows, cursuses, henges, monoliths, cairns, standing stone circles, timber circles, mounds, Silsbury Hill - and of course, the internationally renown Stone Henge. However, we now realise that they carried much DNA from South West Asia!\n\nThey must have thought that they, their beliefs, and their social systems would last until the end of time. We currently think that their populations and farming declined towards the end of their period. There is a little evidence that they may have been subject to plague from Asia. This might have weakened them for the next invasion and displacement.\n\nImage above of Skara Brae, Orkney Neolithic settlement.\n\nImage above of Mottistone Longstone, Isle of Wight.\n\nThe arrival of the Sons of the Steppes - the Beaker\n\nI'll write more about these guys in a later post. Around 2,100 BC, a new people and culture turned up in the British Isles. Whereas the Neolithic peoples had largely originated in SW Asia, south of the Caucasus (with some European hunter-gatherer DNA picked up on the way), these new arrivals largely originated to the NORTH of the Caucasus, on the Pontic and Caspian Steppes. Their Steppe ancestors perfected the domestication of the horse, bronze metallurgy, and wheeled wagons. The founder Steppe population has been identified by archaeologists as the Yamnaya. They rolled into Eastern and Central Europe, where their arrival appears to have spawned the Corded Ware Culture. Their descendants in turn appear to have spawned the Bell Beaker Culture in Western Europe. In turn, the Bell Beaker appears to have developed into the Atlantic Seaboard Celtic Culture of fame and fashion.\n\nThe Eurasian Steppe male haplogroups absolutely dominate present day Europe. However, again, they appear to have absorbed some women with Neolithic and even earlier Hunter-Gatherer populations into their genome.\n\nThe Three Way across Europe\n\nAcross modern Europe, we are a mixture of three distinct late prehistoric populations or genetic out-layers - from most recent to oldest:\n\nYamnaya or Steppe\n\nNeolithic Farmer\n\nWestern Eurasian Hunter-Gatherer\n\nThe above image is from CARTA lecture. 2016. Johannes Krause of the Max Planck Institute. All Rights Reserved.\n\nAs can be seen above, some Neolithic DNA has survived in present day Europe. It is strongest in Southern Europe. Yamnaya ancestry is more of an influence in Northern Europe, although, old Hunter-Gatherer survives strong in the Baltic Republics. The modern population closest to our Neolithic ancestors are the Sardinians. So close, that when \u00d6tzi, a frozen preserved Neolithic body was discovered in the Alps, his DNA was seen as so similar to present day Sardinians, that some incorrectly suggested that he had travelled to the Alps from Sardinia!\n\nMy Neolithic Admixture\n\nDavid Wesolowski's K7 Basal-rich test\n\nBasal-rich\n\nThe Basal Eurasians are a hypothetical \"ghost\" population derived from DNA studies. It is suggested that they splintered from other modern humans 45,000 years ago, presumably outside of Africa, somewhere around the Middle East. They significantly contributed DNA to the Early Neolithic Farmers of the Fertile Crescent and Anatolia, and consequently, on to all of us modern West Eurasians.\n\nDavid gives the English average as 26.5%. My result is 28.8%\n\nGlobal 10 Test\n\nThe recent Global 10 test, run by my friend Helgenes50 of the Anthrogenica board, resulted in:\n\n55% Baalberge_MN (European Middle Neolithic)\n\nFT-DNA My Ancient Origins\n\n47% Farmer (Neolithic)\n\nMy Eurasia K9 ASI Oracle:\n\n27% Early Neolithic Farmer\n\nMy Gedrosia K15 Oracle:\n\n25% Early European Farmer\n\nMy MDLP K16 Modern Admixture\n\n31% Neolithic (modeled on genomes of first neolithic farmers of Anatolia)\n\nMy MDLP Modern K11 Oracle:\n\nAdmix Results (sorted):\n\n#\n\nPopulation\n\nPercent\n\n1\n\nNeolithic\n\n37.33\n\nImage above. Grimes Graves Late Neolithic flint mine complex, Norfolk\n\nMy Neolithic ancestry appears to be strong, for a Brit. However - my Neolithic ancestors may not have all - or even at all, have lived in the British Isles. My Neolithic ancestry may have been picked up along the way, across Europe, by ancestors as they travelled across Western Eurasia.\n\nTags\n\nYou might think that following my recent posts, that I've lost all faith in DNA testing for Ancestry. Not at all. I just object when people take the analysis results of autosomal DNA tests for ancestry, as infallible truths. They are clearly not.\n\nSo far this year, I have commissioned two 23andMe tests, and three FT-DNA tests, a FullGenomes analysis, and a YFull analysis. I have also used free analysis at WeGene and DNA.land, and have run three raw files on GEDmatch calculators. You'd might also think that I've done enough testing for one year! I thought that as well. Then a new service just entered the market.\n\nLiving DNA Ancestry attracted my commission on two particular points. 1) it has an incredible British reference, that promises to break ancestry composition into 30 British regions - in addition to global analysis. If it works, then this is a must for people with significant British ancestry. 2) it uses the latest cutting edge test chip. The latest Illumina chip based on Global Screen Array (GSA). In addition, it uses a European based lab (Denmark), it tests Y-DNA, mtDNA, and autosomes. It tests more SNPs on all three counts, than other current chips used by competitors offering autosomal plus tests. Raw files for the test results will be available for download.\n\nThe British Reference\n\nLiving DNA will be using a British reference broken down into an incredible 30 regions, across England, Scotland, Wales, Orkney, and Northern Ireland. The reference uses the much heralded POBI (Peopling of the British Isles 2015) data set. This project collected 4,500 blood samples from people that could claim four grandparents in the same area, from across the regions of Britain.\n\nA little about the POBI project below:\n\nThe British reference does not include the Republic of Ireland. However, LivingDNA are confident that they have collected a good global reference, and I understand, that they are seeking a similar quality Irish data-set for the future.\n\nIn comparison, other providers of DNA tests for ancestry, only reference to Britain, or the British Isles & Ireland, as a single reference point. And as can be seen by my previous posts, with limited success.\n\nThey also hope to provide imports for formats of raw file from other test companies in the future. LivingDNA do not themselves currently offer relative matching, or health information. Their service is for now, primarily for ancestry.\n\nThe Chip\n\nThey will be using a custom version of the latest Illumina chip technology, the Global Screen Array (GSA). It is encoded with:\n\n650,000 autosomal DNA SNPs\n\n20,000 Y-DNA SNPs\n\n4,000 MT-DNA SNPs.\n\nIn comparison for example, the 23andMe V4 chip scans for:\n\n577,000 atDNA SNPs\n\n2,329 Y-DNA SNPs\n\n3,100 MT-DNA SNPs.\n\nI hope that LivingDNA will also use up-to-date haplogroup nomenclature and information. 23andMe with their V4 chip still use very dated 2009 nomenclature.\n\nSo, let's see if this new service is any improvement to my results, compared with the hit and miss of 23andMe, and Family Tree DNA (FT-DNA). Will they be able to identify and locate my English roots successfully? What will the improved chip make of my haplogroups?"
