    "text": "My three-year-old daughter is worried about dying. She tells us one morning that she\u2019s going to die when she turns 18. Maybe to her, 18 is how I feel about turning 90 \u2013 that\u2019s properly old. Later, I ask what is worrying her about dying. She doesn\u2019t know. She\u2019s three. She can\u2019t quite articulate what it is that\u2019s bothering her. We\u2019re sitting in her room, getting ready for nursery. I\u2019m trying and failing to brush her hair. She\u2019s trying her best to not yelp in pain as I drag a brush through her curls.\n\nI look up and see the small photo of my mum that sits on her shelf. My sister gave it to me to put in my daughter\u2019s room around the time she was born. Mum died in 2011 and it devastated our family. She talked a lot about grandchildren, so it feels sad that she won\u2019t be around to meet them. I start to worry that the photo is the thing that\u2019s making my kid obsess about dying. She likes to run through various members of our family. She wants to know who my siblings are and how they are related to her, who her cousins are, who her grandparents are. She\u2019ll ask me who my dad is, who my sister is and then make the connection with who they are to her.\n\nWhen she first asked me where my mum was, I was taken aback. I didn\u2019t initially know how to answer her. On the one hand, I hate it when parents do saccharine lies to their kids: they\u2019re on holiday, they live on a farm far away, they\u2019re having a long sleep. On the other, my kid\u2019s three. She won\u2019t really understand about death. I chose to be honest. I told her: \u201cMy mum isn\u2019t around any more. She\u2019s dead. She would have loved you very much.\u201d My daughter then asked me: \u201cDo you miss your mum?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cIt makes me feel sad she is not here.\u201d After that, my daughter kept asking where Mum was and whether I felt sad. One day, she said: \u201cWhat happens when we die?\u201d I told her that it meant we weren\u2019t around any more. \u201cI don\u2019t want to die,\u201d she said.\n\nI think she has an existential dread when it comes to death. It\u2019s not so much about the dying, it\u2019s about the simply not being there, the void created by your absence. It\u2019s a lot for a three-year-old to take in. A visit to an Egyptian exhibition at Bristol Museum further confused her, because the mummies and the coffins and the death rituals that were explained to her didn\u2019t really answer her question about where my mum was.\n\nHow do you talk to kids about death? There are some great books that help you talk about grief and loss with them. I like how Michael Rosen\u2019s Sad Book tries to encapsulate the emotion of sadness and demystify it, make the reader feel like it is OK to feel sad, because we all do. Oliver Jeffers\u2019s The Heart and the Bottle is another tear-jerker about loss and dealing with the death of a grandparent. Both of the books help kids navigate the emotions around loss and bereavement.\n\nThe particular issue I seem to have is that my mum has been dead for a while. How do you functionally explain death to a child who has no emotional attachment to the dead person, because they didn\u2019t know them? Maybe that\u2019s the wrong question entirely, but it\u2019s one I keep circling back to. Mostly because I grieve for my mother every day and I wear my pain at her death very overtly on my sleeve. My daughter, being empathetic, can sense that that picture of my mum is important to me, but how does she make a connection with someone she only knows in the abstract?\n\nThese conversations we have with kids around death need to be tangible. And while I work out the best way to talk about it with my child, she\u2019s still doing her own version of processing the very concept of death by checking in with me about what it even means. While death is something we\u2019ll all experience in some way, is three years old too early to be dealing with the preciousness of life?"
