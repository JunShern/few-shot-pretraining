DH is pretty stuck on James.\nBut yeah, with all the hypotheticals it could end up totally different.\n\nIt depends on how you and your friends feel more than anything else. For example, I adored the name Oliver for years. One day a girl from high school (not even a friend of mine - and we live hours away from each other) named her son Oliver. The appeal of the name was shattered. Make sure none of your friends would feel the same way if you were to use the name James."
