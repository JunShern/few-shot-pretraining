Short of divine intervention, no amount of luck, sorcery or practical know-how can save you from a bad property if the numbers simply don\u2019t work.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret. It\u2019s just slightly elusive. And honestly, I totally understand how SO MANY landlords fall into this trap.\n\nMost new investors will get an approval letter from the bank saying they can afford a property worth \u201cX\u201d so they calculate their mortgage payments, potential rental income & property taxes and sign on the dotted line.\n\nThe truth is, that there is so much more to consider! That\u2019s why I always run all of the numbers before even considering a purchase. While it may be tempting to take shortcuts like using the famous \u201c50% Rule\u201d when vetting properties, shortcuts like this can be disastrous when you\u2019re on the hook for hundreds of thousands of dollars."
