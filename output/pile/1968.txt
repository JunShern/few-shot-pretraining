Section 1170.18, subdivisions (f) and (g)\npermit certain convicted felons who have completed their sentences to apply to have their\nfelony convictions designated as misdemeanors. Subdivision (i) states that section\n1170.18 \"shall not apply to persons who have one or more prior convictions\" for\nspecified serious or violent felonies, including murder. (Italics added.)2 The question is\n\n1\n    All statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise stated.\n2\n The full text of subdivision (i) is as follows: \"The provisions of this section [section\n1170.18] shall not apply to persons who have one or more prior convictions for an\noffense specified in clause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of\nSection 667 or for an offense requiring registration pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section\n290.\"\n\fwhether \"prior\" means prior to the felony conviction that the applicant is seeking to have\ndesignated as a misdemeanor, or prior to the court's ruling on the application.\n               We conclude that \"prior\" means prior to the court's ruling on the\napplication. We affirm the trial court's order denying appellant's application to have his\nfelony convictions designated as misdemeanors because he was convicted of murder\nprior to the trial court's ruling on the application. It is of no consequence that the murder\nconviction occurred after the felony convictions that he sought to have designated as\nmisdemeanors.\n                                   Procedural Background\n               In January 2015, appellant filed an application requesting that four felony\nconvictions be designated as misdemeanors pursuant to section 1170.18, subdivisions (f)\nand (g). The felony convictions occurred in 2003 (case no. F334169), 2005 (case nos.\nF352789 and F379456), and 2008 (case no. F416886). The District Attorney responded\nthat appellant is ineligible for the requested relief because he was convicted of murder in\ncase no. F435613. The murder conviction occurred after the felony convictions that\nappellant sought to have designated as misdemeanors. In 2013 we affirmed the murder\nconviction. (People v. Johnson (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 623.) The trial court denied the\napplication.\n                                          Discussion\n               Appellant claims that the trial court erroneously denied his application for\ndesignation as misdemeanors. He argues that he was eligible for the requested relief\nbecause his murder conviction occurred after the subject convictions.\n               Where, as here, a matter of statutory construction is involved, \"our task is to\ndiscern the lawmakers' intent. [Citation.] Because section [1170.18] was enacted by the\nelectorate, it is the voters' intent that controls. [Citation.] Nonetheless, our interpretation\nof a ballot initiative is governed by the same rules that apply in construing a statute\nenacted by the Legislature. [Citations.] We therefore first look to 'the language of the\nstatute, affording the words their ordinary and usual meaning and viewing them in their\nstatutory context.' [Citations.]\" (People v. Park (2013) 56 Cal.4th 782, 796.) \"'When the\n\n                                               2\n\flanguage is ambiguous, \"we refer to other indicia of the voters' intent, particularly the\nanalyses and arguments contained in the official ballot pamphlet.\" [Citation.]'\n[Citation.]\" (Robert L. v. Superior Court (2003) 30 Cal.4th 894, 901.)\n              The term \"prior\" in subdivision (i) is ambiguous. The ambiguity is \"cured\"\nby the Legislative Analyst's comments on Proposition 47 in the Official Voter\nInformation Guide for the November 4, 2014 general election. The Legislative Analyst\nmade clear that \"prior\" means prior to the court's ruling on an application to have a felony\nconviction designated as a misdemeanor: \"This measure [Proposition 47] allows\noffenders currently serving felony sentences for the above crimes to apply to have their\nfelony sentences reduced to misdemeanor sentences. In addition, certain offenders who\nhave already completed a sentence for a felony that the measure changes could apply to\nthe court to have their felony conviction changed to a misdemeanor. However, no\noffender who has committed a specified severe crime [e.g., murder] could be resentenced\nor have their conviction changed.\" (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014),\nProp. 47, Analysis by Legislative Analyst, p. 36, italics added.) Thus, it makes no\ndifference whether appellant was convicted of murder before or after the felony\nconvictions that he sought to have designated as misdemeanors. Appellant was ineligible\nfor relief because, when the trial court ruled on his application, he had a prior conviction\nfor murder.\n              \"The Legislative Analyst's comments, like other materials presented to the\nvoters, 'may be helpful but are not conclusive in determining the probable meaning of\ninitiative language.' [Citation.] Thus, when other statements in the election materials\ncontradict the Legislative Analyst's comments we do not automatically assume that the\nlatter accurately reflects the voters' understanding. [Citation.]\" (San Francisco\nTaxpayers Assn. v. Bd. of Supervisors (1992) 2 Cal.4th 571, 580.) Nothing in the election\nmaterials for Proposition 47 contradicts the Legislative Analyst's conclusion that \"no\noffender who has committed a specified severe crime could be resentenced or have their\nconviction changed.\" (See People v. Superior Court (Henkel) (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 78,\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\f82 [Legislative Analyst's comment \"eliminates doubt\" as to correct interpretation of\nballot proposition].)\n              Moreover, the rebuttal to the argument against Proposition 47 made clear\nthat a person who has been convicted of murder cannot seek relief under section 1170.18\nregardless of when the conviction occurred: \"Proposition 47 does not require automatic\nrelease of anyone. There is no automatic release. It includes strict protections to protect\npublic safety and make sure rapists, murderers, molesters and the most dangerous\ncriminals cannot benefit.\" (Voter Information Guide, supra, Rebuttal to Argument\nAgainst Prop. 47, p. 39.)\n              Finally, section 2 of Proposition 47 provides, \"This act ensures that\nsentences for people convicted of dangerous crimes like rape, murder, and child\nmolestation are not changed.\" (Voter Information Guide, supra, Text of Proposed Law:\nThe Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Act, \u00a7 2, p. 70.) Section 3, subdivision (1) of\nProposition 47 includes a similar provision: \"In enacting this act, it is the purpose and\nintent of the people of the State of California to: [\u00b6] (1) Ensure that people convicted of\nmurder, rape, and child molestation will not benefit from this act.\" (Id., \u00a7 3, subd. (1), p.\n70.) Were we to adopt appellant's interpretation of \"prior conviction\" in subdivision (i),\npeople like appellant who had been convicted of murder would benefit from Proposition\n47. This would be contrary to the intent of the electorate. \"'[W]e may not properly\ninterpret the measure in a way that the electorate did not contemplate: the voters should\nget what they enacted, not more and not less.' [Citation.]\" (People v. Park, supra, 56\nCal.4th at p. 796.)\n              Our interpretation of \"prior conviction\" in subdivision (i) is consistent with\nPeople v. Zamarripa (2016) 247 Cal.App.4th 1179, 1184 [\"the 'prior conviction'\nineligibility for relief means a disqualifying conviction that occurred any time before the\nfiling of the application for Proposition 47 relief\"]. It is also consistent with People v.\nMontgomery (2016) 247 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1392 [\"section 1170.18 precludes\nredesignation for anyone who has a conviction for the enumerated excluded crimes prior\nto the time of the application for such relief\"].\n\n                                               4\n\f                                      Disposition\n             The order denying appellant's application to designate felony convictions as\nmisdemeanors pursuant to section 1170.18 is affirmed.\n             NOT TO BE PUBLISHED.\n\n\n\n                                                        YEGAN, J.\n\n\nWe concur:\n\n\n\n             GILBERT, P.
