Although state governments generally were reining in their contributions, the federal government greatly stepped up the flow of research dollars to universities, especially for defense-related projects.\n\nMany colleges learned to pluck the federal purse strings, but one university was performing symphonies on them. Stanford University raked in $1.8 billion in federal research funds over the decade. Although the Massachusetts Institute of Technology was not far behind Stanford in gathering federal money-and Johns Hopkins University actually surpassed them-no one did it with more flair and cunning.\n\nStanford`s fame in this area became so widespread that other schools asked Stanford`s financial wizards to hold seminars on the subject.\n\nNow the government has decided that Stanford`s pursuit of federal money was overly zealous. After the widespread disclosure of such peculiar items as billing the government for maintenance of the mausoleum housing the family of university founder Leland Stanford and for flowers in the president`s house, the feds have asked the university for a $230 million refund.\n\nThe path from boom to embarrassment for this prestigious school began several decades ago when the federal government became the principal backer of on-campus scientific research. It then established billing procedures for two kinds of costs: direct and indirect. Direct costs are those items, from test tubes to researchers` salaries, that are obvious, necessary expenses incurred while conducting a particular research project.\n\nThe category of indirect costs assumes that a university has to have an academic infrastructure in place to support research. For example, the university library must subscribe to scientific publications if its researchers are to keep abreast of their fields; and, even though the cost of those periodicals cannot be directly ascribed to a particular project, universities should be allowed to recover this ``indirect`` cost.\n\nUnder that policy, each university negotiated a reimbursement rate with the federal government. If a university took on a project with direct costs of, say, $100,000 and had negotiated an indirect cost rate of 50 percent, it could tack an additional $50,000 onto its bills.\n\nAnother way to look at it is that a university requesting a 50 percent indirect cost rate was claiming that half of its campus was devoted to research. A school claiming 75 percent was saying three-fourths of its campus supported research.\n\nThe government is billed for indirect costs and either allows or disallows them. Only allowed expenses are paid for, but the funds recovered can be used for virtually any purpose the university wants. Also, in the 1980s, the federal government enlarged its definition of indirect costs, allowing universities to use those funds to finance construction of new facilities. Stanford administrators quickly realized that this golden goose could help make true its century-old dream of being the ``Harvard of the West.``\n\nThat realization helped make the decade a heady time at Stanford. With a combination of California-style flash and old-fashioned entrepreneurial spirit, the school became one of academia`s leading recipients of federal funds.\n\nThe accompanying overhead funds fed a construction fever as Stanford put up buildings at a rate of more than two a year. That building boom, however, outpaced even Stanford`s ability to obtain federal contracts. Noting the shortfall, the school`s administrators repeatedly negotiated increases in its indirect cost rate, finally reaching 74 percent, one of the highest in the nation.\n\nBut even as the university negotiated more funds, its researchers-who had engendered these funds through their grants-saw a lot of money slipping away from their labs to pay for a mushrooming bureaucracy and to build up cash-poor humanities departments.\n\nTo the university`s researchers, the rocketing overhead rate eventually became a liability. They found themselves priced out of the increasingly stiff competition for federal grants as more and more universities aimed at becoming first-class research schools. Schools with lower overhead rates could offer research at cheaper rates.\n\n``The overhead rate was a cancer eating away at the university,`` said William Spicer, a Stanford professor of electrical engineering. ``There was no accountability.``\n\nIn the spring of 1990, faculty resentment reverberated far beyond the Palo Alto campus, catching the attention of Paul Biddle, a zealous government accountant who realized that taxpayers were footing the bill for Stanford`s freewheeling lifestyle."
