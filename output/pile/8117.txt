regardless of\nthe obstacles.\nThis is especially true as it pertains to\ndrug cartels who will do just about anything\nto ensure their products get delivered to\ntheir clients in the U.S.\nSo, what are some methods that are used to\nsneak drugs past border patrol?\nWell, let\u2019s put it to you this way, if you\ncan think it, odds are it has been attempted\nbefore.\nThe U.S.-Mexican border has been increasing\nits security lately with the deployment of\nactive duty troops, which reflect the budding\nmilitarization of the area.\nStates that border with Mexico include California,\nArizona, New Mexico and Texas.\nAs of 2018, two thousand National Guard Personnel\nguard this line with roughly half of them\nin Texas and the other half spread out throughout\nCalifornia, Arizona and New Mexico.\nWith so much protection, it can be difficult\nto envision cartels delivering drugs into\nthe country successfully.\nSo, how on Earth do they do it?\nBefore we delve into all the creative methods\nthat have been used to smuggle drugs, we thought\nwe\u2019d first examine some research to look\nat why drugs are a problem and the extent\nof its severity to better understand what\nwe\u2019re dealing with.\nA 2015 report from the U.S. Drug Enforcement\nAdministration explained that drug overdoses\nwere responsible for more deaths in the U.S.\nthan car accidents or gunshots.\nSome deaths were due to prescription drugs,\nothers by cocaine, and many from the use of\nheroin.\nIn terms of opioid overdose, Ohio ranks supreme\nwith the highest death toll in the U.S.\nAbout 5,000 people are said to die from opioid\noverdoses in Ohio each year.\nThis state also has one of the largest female\nprison populations in the country with 35%\nof charges against women being drug related.\nDrugs are an extremely powerful substance\nand can control the mind like an unstoppable\nforce.\nExperiments on rats in the 1970\u2019s provided\nus with a lot of information on the issue.\nScientists found that, when given the opportunity,\nrats would choose to consume heroin or cocaine\nrelentlessly to the point of destroying their\nbodies and brains until death overcame them\nthrough overdose.\nIt can be difficult to resist because drugs\ntrigger the pleasure center part of the brain,\nwhich reinforce an organism to consume more\nof the substance.\nThis explains why campaigns that preach the\nslogan, \u201cjust say no,\u201d often prove to\nbe ineffective at stopping drug use.\nDrugs can magically alter our moods and shift\nus from feeling depressed and lonely to being\nhappy and optimistic.\nThus, it can be difficult to \u201cjust say no\u201d\nto a solution for your awful feeling.\nNot all drugs are bad and under the right\ncircumstances, when monitored by a medical\nprofessional, they can be extraordinarily\nhelpful for relieving the suffering of people\nwho are experiencing very painful medical\nconditions.\nWe spoke with some clinicians who explained\nthat if there is a high rate of abuse or suspicion\nof drug abuse, this can often make doctors\nuneasy about prescribing certain prescription\nmedications in fear of aiding the development\nof addiction.\nThis can be extraordinarily difficult for\npeople who truly need it for moderate to severe\ndiscomfort.\nDrugs in the wrong hands may also lead to\nseizures and higher rates of crime.\nAccording to aforeverrecovery.com, \u201ca national\nsurvey shows that more than 32% of state prisoners\nand 26% of federal prisoners were using drugs\nwhen they committed their crimes.\u201d\nDoes this imply that drugs directly cause\npeople to commit crimes?\nOf course not.\nBut it may suggest there exists a correlational\nrelationship between the two.\nIt is not surprising that mind-altering substances\ncan pose as an influential factor on the thought\nprocesses that lead to certain behavioral\noutcomes, such as with acts of criminality.\nFor instance, if a drug makes you feel invulnerable,\nyou may then believe that you can get away\nwith anything.\nIf you take a hallucinogen, on the other hand,\nyou may experience hallucinations or delusions\nthat cause you to lose your sense of reality,\nsuch as having voices in your head telling\nyou what to do.\nSo, now you might be wondering what types\nof drugs are smuggled into the U.S.?\nFor this we examined the statistics of most\ncommonly trafficked drugs into the US as well\nas the percentages of offenses per drug.\nGoing in ascending order, statistics show\nthat oxycodone consists of 4.6%, heroin has\nhigher rates up to 9.8%, crack cocaine is\nset at 13.1%, and marijuana resides at 21.5%.\nCocaine and methamphetamine consist of the\nmost commonly smuggled drugs at roughly 24%.\nAlthough Mexico isn\u2019t the only culprit,\nit is said to be the source of most forbidden\ndrugs that enter the US.\nNow we turn to answer the question you\u2019ve\nbeen patiently waiting for: how do they do\nit?\nWhen you see how heavily guarded the border\ncrossing is, it might appear impossible.\nYet, there are a multitude of creative and\ningenious ways that drugs have attempted to\nget across.\nOur first examples relate to the use of smuggling\ndrugs by air from the ground.\nThis includes the use of catapults.\nNow, we can guess what you\u2019re probably thinking\nright now.\nA catapult, really?\nIn multiple instances, cartels were caught\nusing giant catapults to hurl drugs over the\nborder into the U.S. where someone would retrieve\nthem on the other side of the fence.\nCatapults have been found on numerous occasions\non the Arizona-Mexican border, flinging sacks\nfilled with drugs roughly 328 feet.\nTo put this into better perspective, that\u2019s\nfurther than the height of London\u2019s Big\nBen clock tower if this iconic landmark were\nto be propped horizontally across a large\nstretch of land.\nTalk about jumping the fence!\nIn some instances, t-shirt cannons were also\nused to shoot drugs over the border.\nThis may be unsurprising when considering\nthat this staple of sporting events has often\nbeen used to fire contraband into prison yards\nas well.\nMexican authorities also found and seized\na homemade bazooka that was being used to\nlaunch marijuana into the United States.\nNPR explained that this bazooka had been adapted\nspecifically to use a compressor for shooting\nout drugs.\nMexican officials seized some 1,800 pounds\nworth of marijuana that may have reached the\nU.S. by use of this bazooka.\nFinally, it may come to no surprise that drug\nsmugglers would utilize the advent of drones.\nThe Washington Examiner reported data showing\nthat 15 drones had been spotted between Tijuana,\nMexico and Southern California from late 2017\nto 2018.\nThese drones carried drugs attached to them\nwhile flying over the border.\nDrones are also often used to spy on border\npatrol agents with a camera from hundreds\nof feet above.\nSince federal law enforcement agents do not\nyet have any tools for detecting drones, they\nmust mostly rely on their eyes and ears.\nEven if they do spot one, however, they cannot\nshoot it down with their guns without approval,\nwhich leaves them pretty helpless to do anything\nabout it for the most part.\nAlso, because a person flying a drone can\noperate it from a few hundred feet to a couple\nof miles away, he may be very tough to locate.\nFor this reason, owners of drones have often\nbeen able to avoid capture by U.S. federal\nlaw enforcement.\nSo, the next time your curiosity consumes\nyou and you decide to use your drone to harmlessly\nspy on your neighbor\u2019s newly installed backyard\nswimming pool, you might consider that you\u2019re\nusing a device that a drug smuggler would\nlove to have his hands on.\nYour neighbor, however, probably won\u2019t be\ntoo thrilled about it and you might overhear\nsome yelling that sounds something sort of\nlike, \u201cdarn you crazy kids!\u201d\nWe hope for their sake and yours that they\u2019re\nnot in the middle of skinny dipping when you\ndo this.\nThat could be a disturbing and embarrassing\nscene.\nSo, we\u2019ve discussed methods of drug smuggling\nby air.\nWhat about underground?\nIn 1990, a tunnel was discovered, which ran\n273 feet under the ground from a luxurious\nhome in Agua Prieta, Mexico to a warehouse\nin Arizona.\nOddly, this tunnel was equipped with electrical\nlighting, a drainage system and a trolley\nfor transporting the drugs.\nAn entire, fancy operation was being conducted\nbeneath the surface and no one had any idea.\nWhat made it even more high-tech, according\nto insightcrime.org, was that it possessed\na \u201chidden switch inside the luxury home\nthat, when activated, boosted a pool table\nand concrete slab below it high into the air\nto open the way to a narrow shaft below.\u201d\nWe must admit, that sounds pretty cool.\nOne of the biggest tunnels was discovered\nin April 2016.\nIt ran half a mile from a house in Tijuana,\nMexica to an industrial property in San Diego.\nIt, also, was equipped with lighting, rails\nand a ventilation system.\nThe tunnel was designed to transport huge\namounts of drugs \u2013 we\u2019re talking tons!\nThis just goes to show how far people are\nwilling to use their ingenuity when it comes\nto earning profit from dealing drugs.\nWe suppose this is what you get when you combine\ndrugs with too much spare time.\nNow let\u2019s delve into some of the most insane\nways that drugs have been attempted to smuggle\ninto the US.\nFrom cargo boxes to the inside of cars, there\nare many imaginative and innovative methods\npeople have utilized in the attempt to sneak\ndrugs into the U.S.\nOften, religious items, relics or associations\nhave been used by smugglers to appear innocent,\nwholesome, and to try to evade suspicion.\nThis was the case in 2013 when three women\nfrom Colombia attempted to smuggle 4.4 pounds\nof cocaine that was strapped to their legs\nwhile they were dressed as nuns.\nCrossing the Mexican-United States border\ninto Texas in 2008, an elderly woman was found\ndriving with a 7-pound memento, a statue of\nJesus.\nShe probably thought that, being old in combination\nwith possessing a religious item would make\nher appear like the epitome of virtue, but\nshe underestimated the powerful smelling ability\nof canine noses.\nDrug sniffing dogs went crazy over the statue\u2019s\nscent, but, initially, officials didn\u2019t\nfind any drugs inside of it.\nThey later found that this was because the\nstatue itself was the drug.\nIt was molded out of plaster that had been\nmixed with cocaine.\nWe\u2019re not entirely sure how the receivers\nof the statue planned on taking the cocaine\nfrom it, but we suppose they would have thought\nof some way to do it.\nStill, if you find yourself putting forth\na lot of effort to erode a Jesus statue for\na hit, it\u2019s possible that it may be time\nto reassess what you\u2019re doing with your\nlife.\nThis occasion wasn\u2019t the first time an elderly\nwoman was used to cross the border with drugs.\nOn August 8, 2018, an 81-year-old woman was\nalso driving in her car when she was stopped\nby CBP agents.\nThe dogs also smelled something suspicious\nradiating from her vehicle, a 2011 Chrysler\n200.\nUpon investigation, agents discovered $870,000\nworth of heroin stashed inside.\nNow, we don\u2019t mean inside the car in plain\nview like on top of the seat.\nWe mean literally inside the car, stuffed\nin its rocker panels.\nIn case you don\u2019t know a lot about the internal\nstructure of cars, the rocker panel is located\nalong the sides of the vehicle between the\nfront and rear wheel, basically below the\ndoors.\nYou lift your feet over this each time you\nclimb in and out of your car.\nA lot of people probably don\u2019t normally\nconsider using this part of their car to hide\nthings so that\u2019s pretty creative!\nIn October of the same year, nine people were\narrested when conspiring to sneak meth into\nHawaii.\nThe drugs were disguised as decorative artifacts,\nsuch as Aztec calendars and statues.\nSimple souvenirs?\nWe think not.\nOne of the wildest attempts to sneak across\nthe border occurred on October 30, 2012 when\na makeshift ramp was created to scale the\n14-foot-tall border fence.\nA jeep presumably containing marijuana attempted\nto drive over this ramp into the United States\nfrom Mexico.\nThe perpetrators\u2019 plot was foiled, however,\nwhen the jeep got stuck at the top of the\nfence.\nIt started teetering, which made the two intruders\npanic and flee back to Mexico.\nIt\u2019s comical to imagine the reactions on\nthe faces of officials when they first arrived\nat the scene.\nThey probably mumbled something to each other\nlike, \u201cWell, now I\u2019ve seen everything.\u201d\nAlthough our next examples did not occur at\nthe U.S. border, we think these make for honorable\nmentions.\nWe must use full disclosure though and warn\nyou that these methods may be disturbing,\nand we wouldn\u2019t recommend that you continue\nwatching if you have a weak stomach or tend\nto get queasy easily.\nAs we\u2019ve discussed, people will use just\nabout anything to smuggle drugs, including\ntheir own bodies.\nThe best-known method for this is to ingest\ntightly wrapped balloons full of drugs and\ntransport them in the stomach.\nThis not only disgusting but dangerous.\nIn 2015, a 24-year-old Brazilian man was on\na flight to Dublin from Lisbon.\nOut of nowhere, he became fiercely agitated\nbefore collapsing to the floor.\nHe was later found dead after one out of 80\npellets, holding nearly 2 pounds worth of\ncocaine, burst in his stomach.\nIn December 2012, a Colombian woman flying\nto Berlin tried to smuggle drugs inside breast\nimplants.\nShe probably figured that she\u2019d get away\nwith it because airport officials wouldn\u2019t\ndare ask to search her there in fear of being\naccused of sexual harassment.\nShe could have gotten away with it if she\ndidn\u2019t start complaining of severe pain.\nThe agony became too unbearable to endure\nany longer, which pushed her to admit that\nshe was carrying 2.2 pounds of cocaine in\nher breasts and seek help.\nMore recently in 2018, a Brazilian man wanted\nto transport 2.2 pounds of cocaine into Portugal.\nHe did this by using padded swimming trunks.\nThe drugs were stored inside a pair of fake\nbutt cheeks, made of two cushion-like implants\nthat were attached to his shorts.\nWe suppose that, like the breast implant woman,\nhe thought he could get away with pretending\nto have a huge rear end.\nIf officials grew suspicious and asked to\nsearch him, he could simply act insulted and\nsay something like, \u201cno, I\u2019m not carrying\nanything.\nThat\u2019s just my butt.\nHands off please.\u201d\nBut the man did not fool anyone, and police\nquickly caught on to his scheme.\nWhat do you think of our picks for examples\nof drug smuggling?\nIs there anything we missed?\nHere with the Infographics Show,
