I would like to add lens correction.\n\nA:\n\nAutomatic presets would do that, see the section \"Module presets\" in Darktable's user manual.  Note that you need Darktable version > 1.4 for this to work sensibly with lens correction.  In earlier versions the lens correction did not adapt correctly to the image parameters.\nRelevant section from the manual:\n\nA module has an expander bar . Clicking on the name of the module\n  expands the module's GUI with all parameters.\nIn its default setting darktable will only expand one GUI at a time.\n  If you click the expander bar of another module, the previous GUI gets\n  collapsed. If you want to see more than one GUI expanded, you may\n  expand further modules with shift-click  \u2013 all previously expanded\n  GUIs remain opened. The expander bar behavior on click and\n  shift-click, respectively, is controlled by a preference setting in\n  gui options (see Section 8.1, \u201cGUI options\u201d).\nExpanding a module does not activate it. You need to click the  icon\n  to turn a module on or off.\nIcon  accesses the module's available presets or creates a new preset\n  from your current settings (see Section 3.2.3, \u201cModule presets\u201d).\n\n"
