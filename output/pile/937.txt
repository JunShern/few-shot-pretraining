Is it possible to add an image button control inside a datatable.\nI'm using Framework 3.5 and C# language.\nThanks In Advance!\nRegards,\nRanga\n\nA:\n\nI think you are trying to work with a user interface control like a DataGrid or DataGridView. DataTable is an ADO.NET class for holding data from a database. It doesn't present data in a user interface, so adding an image button maes no sense.\nI presume you're working with a grid of some sort, but in order to get a sensible answer you need to tell us which one. Is your user interface WPF, Windows Forms, or ASP.NET? Specifically, which grid class are you trying to use?\n\n"
