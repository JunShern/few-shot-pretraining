Thanks for taking my question. Your close rate performance was\nimpressive, how do you measure that?\n\nBob Hull - Chief Financial Officer\n\nLaura, so a couple of different ways, so of late, we have been using satellite\nimagery. So we take pictures of parking lots throughout the course of the\nyear. We max that up with actual transaction counts in stores. Of late we have\nbeen actually using some technology that involves traffic counters in the\nstores, which gives us close rate by day, by hour, which is going to further\nallow Rick and the team to optimize labor going forward. We have tested both\nmethodologies for the same stores and got similar results. We are pretty\ncomfortable with the methodology. It allows us to forecast and see actual\nimprovement in close rates_\n\nFrom the earnings call:\n\n[http://seekingalpha.com/article/2051323-lowes-companies-\nceo-...](http://seekingalpha.com/article/2051323-lowes-companies-ceo-\ndiscusses-q4-2013-results-earnings-call-transcript?page=7&p=qanda&l=last)\n\n------\ngadders\n>> \"A little creepy? Yeah. Smart? Definitely.\"\n\nIs it creepy? They're only looking at car park occupancy in aggregate. They're\nnot tracking car number plates.\n\n~~~\nprotomyth\nI don't get the creepy either. It seems like an ok plan to judge volume[1] of\ntraffic compared to sales. Might even do some analysis of what vehicle types\nare going to the store.\n\n1) I am with other posters and would have put up security cameras and done my\ncount that way\n\n------\ndmd\nI'm puzzled why they would go to the expense of using real time satellite\nimagery for this, versus mounting a camera on a light pole in the parking lot.\n\n~~~\nkfcm\nThis is the exact same thought I had when reading the story.\n\nNot only would it be cheaper, but you could follow each vehicle through the\nlot and figure out the traffic flow patterns better.\n\nPlus, to tie in with this other front-page story (\n[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7346629](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7346629)\n), you could track the plates of the cars, and tie that in with retail\ncellular tracking (\n[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5154089](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5154089)\n). Facial recognition still needs a couple of years. Over time, you could tie\nthe cellular phone, vehicle, and electronic payment (debit or credit card) to\nan individual.\n\nContinual tracking.\n\nAnd all brought to you by technology. In the words of Pogo: \"We have met the\nenemy...and he is us.\"\n\n~~~\nk2enemy\nThat, and you can see the parking lot on cloudy days too.\n\n------\njoebo\nWhy not track how many times the entrance/exit doors open or close? Or add a\nlaser(?) that cuts across the entrance that counts each time it's line is\nbroken. Directional but also simple to do.\n\n~~~\nNaga\nA lot of companies do this actually. Sure its not perfect, but it gives a good\nenough estimate.\n\n------\nrollthehard6\nIt doesn't sound like it would make sense to do this given that stores\ngenerally have counters on the readers that detect stolen tagged items on\nexit. Surely it would be easier to use this data to figure out when the busy\nperiods fall?\n\n------\nmrfusion\nHow about if a hardware chain used satellite imagery to detect new structures\nbeing built, like sheds, barns, etc, and mailed targeted coupons out to the\nproperty owners?\n\n~~~\nTheCraiggers\nIsn't that a bit late in many respects though? The holy grail for a hardware\ncompany would be knowing when a person was _thinking_ about building a new\nshed, barn, etc, not when they've already bought all the wood and nails to\nbegin construction.\n\nThat said, we already know they're trying their damnedest to track just that.\n\n~~~\nvailripper\nIsn't permitting info in the public domain? I wonder why they don't leverage\nthat?\n\n~~~\nTheCraiggers\nA good question. My assumption is that even though it's considered public\nknowledge, there is still a cost for it and it's not electronic.\n\nFor instance, in my state and/or township one can go to township office and\nrequest a copy of all the property taxes for any piece of land, no matter who\nowns it. It costs something like ten dollars and in return you get a hardcopy\nwith a bunch of numbers on it.\n\nAssuming the process for getting copies of new permits is similar, the biggest\ndownside is cost for the information and paying for some intern or whatever to\ntype it in. Even if it's five dollars plus intern is decent chunk of money (I\nhave no idea what the profit margin is on lumber, etc). And then you have to\nfactor in the cost of the promotion which will eat into yet more profits.\n\n~~~\ndrone\nIn Houston, it's electronic and searchable. See:\n[http://www.cohtora.houstontx.gov/ibi_apps/WFServlet?IBIF_ex=...](http://www.cohtora.houstontx.gov/ibi_apps/WFServlet?IBIF_ex=online_permit_start)\n\n------\nincision\nNeat.\n\nSatellite imagery isn't terribly expensive and Lowes has 1830 stores.\n\nI'd bet it's a lot more efficient in the end to just buy a consistent set of\nimages for X stores of interest, X times a year than worry about the\ninstallation, maintenance of location specific concerns of cameras/sensors at\nevery store.\n\n------\nmkmk\nKroger uses infrared near the checkout lines to similar effect:\n[http://www.timesdispatch.com/business/retail/infrared-\ntechno...](http://www.timesdispatch.com/business/retail/infrared-technology-\ncuts-kroger-checkout-time/)\n\n------\nsquigs25\nreally cool? yes. Impractical? probably?\n\nScanning earth using satellites is really cool. Maybe they're outsourcing this\nto a central company, and paying a hundred bucks per store per month. fine.\nBut to be honest, there are some more effective low tech ways to catch these\nnumbers, for example by looking at the number of transactions, or installing\nsensors on every entrance to count the number of people entering.\n\nSeems like they're shooting a pigeon with a cannon.\n\n~~~\nkej\n>But to be honest, there are some more effective low tech ways to catch these\nnumbers\n\nHeck, just have someone count cars and write down the time whenever they\nretrieve shopping carts from the parking lot.\n\n------\nsuprgeek\n\"Satellite imagery\" is the most powerful Sales Tool?\n\nI understand the need for \"link-baity\" headlines but this is flat-out wrong.\nThe very same article goes on to state some numbers - 1% improvement vs 2%\nreduced labor.\n\nIf they can attribute it ALL to Satellite Tracking as opposed to say other\npromotions/general economy & barring other accounting tricks, it is still too\nlittle to be even attributable.\n\n~~~\nlostlogin\nAt the hospital I work at we correlate 'sales'in a similar way. Just we found\na cheaper way. We noticed that at night less people come in. So we reduced\nstaffing at night.\n\n------\ngstar\nI don't understand why they don't correlate EPOS, door and aisle counters, put\nit in their data warehouse, and have precise close rate based on 1) visits 2)\nstore departments\n\nI'd have thought this was totally standard practice!\n\nStill though, really cool that they have confidence that satellite imagery is\na good proxy for this.\n\n------\nrickdale\nHm, what the article doesn't say is that Lowes are typically located near Home\nDepot. Definitely close enough to get a snapshot of competitors parking lot\ntoo.\n\n"
