    "text": "Q:\n\nCalculating area of sphere with constraint on zenith\n\nLet $\\mathbb S_R$ be the sphere of radius $R$ centered about the origin. Consider $$A_R= \\left\\{ (x,y,z)\\in \\mathbb S_R \\mid x^2+y^2+(z-R)^2\\leq 1 \\right\\}.$$\nI want to calculate the area of this region of the sphere with radius $R$ about the origin. I already calculated the area of the region of $\\mathbb S_R$ of vectors with zenith $\\leq \\alpha$ is given by $2\\pi R^2(1-\\cos \\alpha)$.\nFor $A_R$, here's my idea. I want to find the zenith $\\alpha$ which satisfies $R\\sin \\alpha=\\sin \\alpha+R$, since this is the zenith of points of both $\\mathbb S_R$ and the unit sphere translated up $R$ units at points which are of the same height. Then, I just want to integrate the zenith $0\\leq \\phi\\leq \\alpha$.\nSolving gives $\\phi=\\arcsin \\frac R{R-1}$ and things get a little messy.\nOn the other hand, another student posted a solution which makes sense. He just writes $\\alpha$ should satisfy $2R^2-2R^2\\cos\\alpha=1$ and then obtains the area of $A_R$ is $\\pi$, independently of the radius.\nWhy is my method wrong?\nPicture\n\nA:\n\nThe problem seems to be what you mean by\n\"the zenith of points of both $\\mathbb S_R$ and the unit sphere translated up $R$ units at points which are of the same height.\"\nThe quantity $R \\sin \\alpha$ is the distance from the $z$ axis of points whose spherical coordinates are $(R, \\theta, \\alpha)$ for any $\\theta,$\nthat is, the points on the sphere $\\mathbb S_R$ that are at a zenith angle of $\\alpha$ relative to the center of that sphere.\nSo far, this makes sense.\nThe quantity $\\sin \\alpha$ is the distance from the $z$ axis of points on the unit sphere about the origin at a zenith angle of $\\alpha.$\nThis does not change when you translate that sphere upward $R$ units,\nso it's unclear why you would add $R.$\nIn fact, since $0 < \\sin\\alpha \\leq 1$ whenver $0 < \\alpha < \\pi,$\nfor any such $\\alpha$ we would find that \n$R \\sin\\alpha \\leq R < R + \\sin\\alpha,$\nso it is impossible to have $R \\sin\\alpha = R + \\sin\\alpha.$\nAnd that equation is just as impossible for $\\alpha = 0$ or $\\alpha = \\pi$\nas long as $R > 0.$\nIn short, the equation you proposed just does not make sense.\nNow there may be some sense in equating the heights ($z$ coordinates)\nof points at the intersection of $\\mathbb S_R$ and the unit sphere around $(0,0,R).$ For that, we use the cosine of the azimuth angle relative to each sphere, and we note that the azimuth angle of these points relative to the sphere around $(0,0,R)$ is greater than their azimuth angle relative to  $\\mathbb S_R.$\nThere is a relationship between the two angles, but it's not what your equation says.\n\nAs for the claim that $2R^2-2R^2\\cos\\alpha=1,$ which the other student presumably did not explain, let $P$ be a point where the two spheres intersect. Then the points $(0,0),$ $(0,R),$ and $P$ form an isoceles triangle with two legs of length $R$ (each a radius of $\\mathbb S_R$) and a base of $1$ (the segment from $(0,R)$ to $P,$ which is a radius of the unit sphere around $(0,R).$)\nIf we drop a perpendicular from either $P$ or $(0,R)$ to the opposite leg, we divide the isoceles triangle into two right triangles, one with hypotenuse $R$ and angle $\\alpha$ and one with hypotenuse $1$ and angle $\\frac\\alpha2.$\nIf we drop a perpendicular from $(0,0)$ to the base of the isoceles triangle, we get two congruent right triangles with hypotenuse $R$ and angle $\\frac\\alpha2,$ with leg $\\frac12$ opposite the angle $\\frac\\alpha2.$\nIn either case we end up having to deal with a right triangle with angle $\\frac\\alpha2.$\nLet's try working with the second pair of right triangles. \nThe construction tells us that $R \\sin\\frac\\alpha2 = \\frac12.$\nSquare both sides and multiply by $2$: \n$$2R^2 \\sin^2\\frac\\alpha2 = 2\\left(\\frac14\\right) = \\frac12.$$\nUse the trigonometry identity \n$2 \\sin^2\\frac\\alpha2 = 1 - \\cos\\alpha$\n(which you can get from either the half-angle sine formula or the double-angle cosine formula)\nto substitute $1 -\\cos\\alpha$ for $2 \\sin^2\\frac\\alpha2$:\n$$R^2(1 - \\cos\\alpha) = \\frac12.$$\nYou can then distribute the $R^2$ over $1-\\cos\\alpha$ and multiply both sides by $2$ to get the other student's formula if you want, although I think the formula above is more convenient for just plugging into your known area formula.\n\n"
