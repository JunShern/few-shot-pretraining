    "text": "Atlanta will soon be working on rewriting its zoning ordinance for the first time in over 30 years, possibly prompting big changes to the city\u2019s parking and public transportation offerings.\n\nTim Keane, Atlanta\u2019s planning commissioner, is designing the zoning rewrite on the basis of making the city more urban and downtown-based. Currently, Atlanta\u2019s approach to zoning favors a more suburban style, which prioritizes driving over walking, according to Keane.\n\n\u201cRight now, the expectation within the zoning ordinance is that every person will drive to do everything and will park right where they want to go,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to eliminate that idea and replace it with the premise that people will get around Atlanta in many different kinds of ways. We have to begin to devote less space in our city to the storage and movement of vehicles.\u201d\n\nOne way Keane is planning on making the city more accessible to walkers, bikers, and public transit users is by decreasing the amount of parking spaces building developers will have to create in order to encourage less driving around the city.\n\nHe said that, \u201cIf we as a city continue to enable this idea that people will be able to park everywhere, then we will have failed the citizens because it is impossible to achieve that. So what people can expect is for parking to become more and more constrained. The better, more convenient, affordable, and safe option for people will be to not drive.\u201d\n\nInstead of driving, Keane said wants more focus to be on public transportation. He says there needs to be space in the streets for transit-only lanes, so buses can move at quicker speeds than the cars. He also wants to improve bus route efficiency in an effort to expand use of public transportation in Atlanta.\n\nMichael Dobbins, a Georgia Tech city planning professor, agrees with Keane.\n\n\u201cThe city has been systematically moving in these directions with incremental zoning and development practice changes since after the Olympics in 1996,\u201d he said. \u201cI think these moves have been positive, as evidenced by the city\u2019s growing population, especially in areas that have used these changes to their advantage. I believe that the new zoning initiatives will only propel these goals forward toward an ever more walkable, accessible city.\u201d\n\nAlthough making public transportation seems like a good idea to many, some people think that reduced parking availability could cause major problems within the city.\n\nHannah Wallace, an Atlanta citizen, driver and Georgia State student said, \u201cLess parking in Atlanta seems like it would be a huge mess. I feel like it is already so difficult to find parking in this city, and MARTA doesn\u2019t take you to every place you need to go.\u201d\n\nImplementing the zoning rewrite in Atlanta could be a multi-year process, but Keane said that changes around the city will be happening sooner than expected.\n\n\u201cBetween now and then, there are many improvements that we can make to the existing zoning ordinance, including changes regarding parking, and those changes will begin this year,\u201d he said."
