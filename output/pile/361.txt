As most observations in fisheries surveys are typically obtained as the number of specimens and length of each sampled specimen, LWR are widely used to transform the survey data into estimates of the biomass which is important for modelling aquatic ecosystems. Therefore, estimation of the LWR is common practice and essential in fisheries science \\[[@pone.0171811.ref002]\\].\n\nThere are two parameters in the LWR model (*W* = *a*\u00d7*L*^*b*^), the coefficient *a* and the exponent *b*. Parameter *a* is the condition factor, describing body shape which can be classified as four groups: eel-like, elongated, fusiform and short and deep \\[[@pone.0171811.ref002]\\]. Parameter *b* is the allometric growth parameter, which indicates isometric growth in body proportions if *b*\u22653 where fish have more girth as it grows longer; the species tends to be more streamlined if the exponent *b*\\<3 \\[[@pone.0171811.ref002]\\].\n\nNumerous studies found that factors, such as geographic, seasonal, inter-annual, and environmental conditions, can affect the estimates of *a* and *b* in the LWR model \\[[@pone.0171811.ref002]--[@pone.0171811.ref005]\\]. Instead of constructing several models reflecting various situations (different regions and years), it is more reasonable to make use of generalized linear mixed model to cover all the spatial and temporal effects in a single model. Linear mixed-effects modelling, a mature model in the statistics community, has been used in multiple fields. Cnaan et al. (1997) provided two detailed case studies to sufficiently introduce the use of the general linear mixed effects model for the regression analysis of correlated data \\[[@pone.0171811.ref006]\\]. Xu et al. (2015, 2014) developed nonlinear mixed-effects model to study the individual-tree diameter growth and linear mixed effects model for individual-tree crown width of China-Fir trees in Southeast China \\[[@pone.0171811.ref007], [@pone.0171811.ref008]\\]. Baayen et al. (2008) provided an introduction of mixed-effects models and illustrated its advantages, which would allow the researcher to simultaneously consider all factors that potentially contribute to the understanding of the structure of the data \\[[@pone.0171811.ref009]\\].\n\nThe linear mixed-effects model provides a powerful and versatile approach to analyze a wide variety of data structures, in which the linear predictor contains random effects in addition to the usual fixed effects \\[[@pone.0171811.ref007]\\]. The random effects vary with respect to one or more grouping variables, e.g. regions and years, adding its contribution of variation to the residual error, which can account for the additional resources of random variation \\[[@pone.0171811.ref007], [@pone.0171811.ref008], [@pone.0171811.ref010]\\].\n\nYellow Croaker (*Larimichthys polyactis*) is a warm-temperate demersal fish species widely distributed throughout the northwest Pacific Ocean. As a commercially important species, Yellow Croaker experienced heavy fishing pressure in China. From catch data derived from *China Fishery Statistical Yearbook*, we found the variations of Yellow Croaker stock ([S1 Fig](#pone.0171811.s001){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). Yellow Croaker were abundant in 1950s and the beginning of 1960s; but the stock collapsed in the 1970s \\[[@pone.0171811.ref011]\\]. After a series of restoration efforts (i.e. seasonal fishery closure and protection of the spawning ground), the Yellow Croaker stock has been recovering since 1990 and the catch has increased continually in the subsequent two decades \\[[@pone.0171811.ref012]--[@pone.0171811.ref014]\\]. However, the characteristics of the stock have changed; as individuals are smaller, younger and reaching maturity earlier \\[[@pone.0171811.ref013],[@pone.0171811.ref015],[@pone.0171811.ref016]\\].\n\nQuite many scientists have done much work about the growth of Yellow Croaker around the world. Li *et al*. (2013) applied simple linear regression to analyze LWRs of Yellow Croaker in Bohai Sea-Northern Yellow Sea from 1960 to 2004 and in the Southern Yellow Sea from 1960 to 2010 for male and female respectively \\[[@pone.0171811.ref003]\\]. Zhang *et al*. (2010) investigated the biological characteristics of Yellow Croaker in the central and southern Yellow Sea, including the LWRs in 1960, 1985, 1998 and 2008 \\[[@pone.0171811.ref017]\\]. Lin *et al*. (2004) studied the population biology of Yellow croaker in the East China Sea, which evaluated the LWR in 1963, 1983 and 2001 \\[[@pone.0171811.ref018]\\]. All these studies of LWR used simple linear regression to develop region specific or year specific models, rather than linear mixed-effects models, to detect the spatial and temporal variations of Yellow Croaker.\n\nIn this study, our objective was to analyze the biological characteristics of Yellow Croaker in recent years. Specifically, we estimated the LWR of Yellow Croaker used linear mixed-effects model, condition factors relative to reference years, and explore the possible relationship between parameters in LWR model and environmental factors, based on the observations along north coast of China among 2008 and 2011 to 2015.\n\nMaterials and methods {#sec002}\n=====================\n\nData collection {#sec003}\n---------------\n\nSpecimens were collected along the Shandong and Jiangsu province through 2008, and 2011--2015.

Because the variance of W increases when L increases, above equation was log-transformed and the equation becomes: $$\\text{ln}\\left( W \\right) = \\text{ln}\\left( a \\right) + b \\times \\text{ln}\\left( L \\right)$$\n\nWe fit a generalized linear model (GLM), simple linear models for individuals in different regions and years (SLMR and SLMY for regions and years respectively), as well as nine linear mixed effect models (LMEM) that treated region and/or year as random effects to coefficient *a* and/or the exponent *b* to explain the relationship between length and weight ([Table 2](#pone.0171811.t002){ref-type=\"table\"}) \\[[@pone.0171811.ref007]\\].

The maximum, minimum and mean (95% CI) lengths of the Yellow Croaker sample were 21.0 cm, 2.6 cm and 10.9 cm (5.1, 15.5 cm), respectively. The most commonly encountered length group was 11.5--12.4 cm, followed by length group 10.5--11.4 cm. The sample was dominated by individuals ranging from 8 cm to 14 cm in length, with variations among regions and years ([Fig 2](#pone.0171811.g002){ref-type=\"fig\"}).\n\n![Length and weight of Yellow Croaker among regions and years.\\\nThe boxes show the median (solid line) and the interquartile range.

In addition, the water quality of Chinese coast varied widely among years. When the water quality became poorer, condition factor *a* decreased, with the reverse condition for parameter *b* ([Fig 4](#pone.0171811.g004){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Negative correlation (-0.47) and positive correlation (0.61) were found for PWAP with condition factor *a* and for PWAP parameter *b* respectively, while t-test indicated both the correlation coefficients were not significant (df = 4, *P*\\>0.05).\n\n![Water quality versus parameters *a* (A) and *b* (B) in LWR of Yellow Croaker.](pone.0171811.g004){#pone.0171811.g004}\n\nRelative condition factors {#sec011}\n--------------------------\n\nSummary of condition factor relative to reference year of 1960, 1986, 2005, 2007, 2008\\~2009 and 2010 were shown in [S2 Table](#pone.0171811.s007){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}.

With the exception of *K* ~*cur/1960*~, relative condition factors began to decline in 2012. However, values of *K* ~*cur/1960*~ remained stable over time, again with the exception of 2012. Relative condition factors were much lower in summer than other seasons, and reached maximum during autumn and early winter, with diverse variations degree to different reference years. As for spatial variations, values of relative condition factors decreased with decreasing latitude, while there was little variation (0.71\\~0.81) for *K* ~*cur/1960*~ among different regions. Generally, relative condition factors increased as Yellow Croaker grew, except for *K*~*cur/1960*~, while there were different variation ranges among different sizes of individuals for condition factors relative to different reference year([Fig 5](#pone.0171811.g005){ref-type=\"fig\"}). When the body length of Yellow Croaker was less than 10 cm, values of condition factores relative to reference years 2005, 2007, 2008\\~2009 and 2010 kept much constant. However, values of *K* ~*cur/1960*~, decreased as individuals grew larger, and remained stable at lengths 14--18 cm.

Study of Froese \\[[@pone.0171811.ref029]\\] shows that values of parameter *a* of fish species, with fusiform body shape, was 0.0112 (geometric mean) with 95% range of 0.00514 to 0.0245. The results are consistent with the body shape of this species, which is described as fusiform in Fishbase \\[[@pone.0171811.ref030]\\].\n\nThe point estimate of exponent *b*, was a little lower than values 3.03 (2.91--3.15) in Fishbase \\[[@pone.0171811.ref029]\\]. Values of parameter *b* for fishes were suggested by Carlander \\[[@pone.0171811.ref031]\\] and Froese \\[[@pone.0171811.ref002]\\] to normally fall within the range of 2.5 \\~ 3.5 and 2.7 \\~ 3.4, respectively, which cover the range of parameter *b* of Yellow Croaker in this study. The fixed value of allometric growth parameter *b*, indicated a very slight decrease in plumpness or elongation in form with increase in length. However, when random effects were used, no significant difference with isomeric growth was found for Yellow Croaker \\[[@pone.0171811.ref032]\\].\n\nRandom region effects for *a* demonstrated that values of *a* reduced gradually as the latitude decreased, from north to south, except in Coastal Waters of Northern Shandong. Samples in the Coastal Waters of Northern Shandong were collected from fishermen, and the origin of the samples were not clear, which could be the reason that parameters with the random effect of NS did not follow this trend. Yellow Croaker distributed on China's coast were considered to be divided into various populations, while individuals in northern Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea (NYBS) were believed to be different from those in southern Yellow Sea (SYS) \\[[@pone.0171811.ref019],[@pone.0171811.ref033],[@pone.0171811.ref034]\\]. The results of this study suggested that Yellow Croaker sampled from Yellow River Estuary and Coastal Waters of Northern Shandong should be included in NYBS, while those in other regions belonged to SYS. Different subpopulation maybe the main reason that led to their significant spatial variation in length-weight relationships.\n\nPrevious research has examined LWR variation for Yellow Croaker; including spatial, temporal, sexual, and length variations, which covered Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea and East China Sea from 1960 to 2010 \\[[@pone.0171811.ref003],[@pone.0171811.ref011],[@pone.0171811.ref014],[@pone.0171811.ref017],[@pone.0171811.ref018], [@pone.0171811.ref035]--[@pone.0171811.ref041]\\]. In these LWRs (51 models), values of parameter *a* ranged from 0.0061 to 0.1027, with mean of 0.028 \u00b1 0.019; values of exponent *b* ranged from 2.32 to 3.35, with mean of 2.875 \u00b1 0.217. This, accompanied with relative condition factors, could support the hypothesis, that individuals were becoming thinner and young-age in recent years.\n\nSeveral influencing factors of LWR were evaluated in previous studies \\[[@pone.0171811.ref003],[@pone.0171811.ref042],[@pone.0171811.ref043]\\]. Pollutions such as inorganic nitrogen, active phosphate and oil pollutant, frequent pollutants in the north coast of China, are believed to make food availability and oxygen level deteriorate, which would negatively influence the growth of Yellow Croaker \\[[@pone.0171811.ref044]--[@pone.0171811.ref046]\\]. In this study, the data revealed that values of condition factor *a* decreased, when the environmental pollution increased. Therefore, LWR could be a rough indicator for the environment quality. Limited sample years maybe the reason that resulted in the non-significant correlation from statistics test, so further long term monitoring is suggested in the future.\n\nCondition changes compared with historical records {#sec014}\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nRelative condition factor provided an effective approach to compare the observed weight of an individual with the baseline weight of that length \\[[@pone.0171811.ref028],[@pone.0171811.ref047]\\]. Compared to individuals in previous decades \\[[@pone.0171811.ref003],[@pone.0171811.ref011]\\], Yellow Croaker condition declined in recent years. *K*~*cur/1960*~ remained comparatively stable, without obvious variation. *K*~*cur/2005*~, *K*~*cur/2007*~, *K*~*cur/2008\\ 9*~ and *K*~*2010*~ had similar variation patterns, since the LWR of Yellow Croaker in these years were similar, while values of *K*~*cur/2005*~ were much lower. However, *K*~*cur/1986*~ have similar variation pattern but higher variation, since the stock of Yellow Croaker collapsed during the 1980s and had been in an unstable condition in 1986 \\[[@pone.0171811.ref016],[@pone.0171811.ref048]\\].\n\nCondition factors relative to all reference years, reached the highest value in 2012, as specimens in 2012 were collected in May and September ([S1 Table](#pone.0171811.s006){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}), which was just before spawning and after feeding. A weak El Nino in 2012 might be another possible reason that led to elevated relative condition factors.\n\nMonthly changes in condition factors are related to life history events of this fish, e.g., sexual maturation, spawning and feeding strategies \\[[@pone.0171811.ref014],[@pone.0171811.ref049],[@pone.0171811.ref050]\\]. Adult yellow croaker in these areas reach their full gonads maturity in spring, reproduce in June and then primarily feed in summer and autumn \\[[@pone.0171811.ref049],[@pone.0171811.ref051]\\]. The condition factor (*K*) behaved in accordance to this series of events. It reached a high value in May, dropped precipitately in June, gradually recovered in August and reached the highest value in December.\n\nSpatial variation of *K* discovered that Yellow Croaker was skinny in the south, with worse condition than in the north. It was widely reported the Yellow Croaker stock shifted in size and age structure to feature more small and young fish that mature earlier, in response to severe fishing pressure over the past half century \\[[@pone.0171811.ref015],[@pone.0171811.ref016],[@pone.0171811.ref040],[@pone.0171811.ref048]\\]. This circumstance was also reflected in the length variation of condition factor relative to reference year of 1960.\n\nSince there was only one sample of L = 21cm, the condition factor relative to all reference years became an exception in L = 21cm for length variation of Yellow Croaker. Moreover, just as values of parameter *a*, water pollution led to *K* worse. The exception value *K* in 2012 relative to all reference years, probably resulted from the more significant effects from monthly variation and nearly null El Nino in 2012 ([Fig 5](#pone.0171811.g005){ref-type=\"fig\"}).\n\nApplications of mixed effects model in studying spatial-temporal variations of LWR {#sec015}\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAccording to AIC and MAE, linear mixed effect model with effects from both regions and years on both parameters *a* and *b* was supported as the best one. The recommended model matches previous studies that the exact relationship between length and weight differs among regions and years, according to the habitat condition \\[[@pone.0171811.ref004],[@pone.0171811.ref005],[@pone.0171811.ref052],[@pone.0171811.ref053]\\]. However, many studies on LWR for fishes used region specific or year specific models fitting to region or year specific dataset to detect the spatial and temporal variations of individuals \\[[@pone.0171811.ref004],[@pone.0171811.ref054],[@pone.0171811.ref055]\\], as seen from previous 51 LWR models for Yellow Croaker \\[[@pone.0171811.ref003],[@pone.0171811.ref011],[@pone.0171811.ref014],[@pone.0171811.ref017],[@pone.0171811.ref018],[@pone.0171811.ref035]--[@pone.0171811.ref041]\\]. The mixed effects model took account of regions and years as random effects in a single model, which was more convenient and reasonable to estimate the spatial and temporal variations. It also allow regions and years with limited samples to borrow strength from other regions and years \\[[@pone.0171811.ref010]\\].\n\nFurthermore, mixed effects model provided an effective approach to estimate the effects of variables, observations of which could be unavailable \\[[@pone.0171811.ref007],[@pone.0171811.ref008]\\]. In this study, our survey data were quite poor: there were 23 blanks in the 6\u00d76 (Regions-Years) data matrix ([Table 1](#pone.0171811.t001){ref-type=\"table\"}), while mixed effects model effectively evaluated the effects of regions and years. In the future, more variations of LWR, such as sex, season, and growth stage should be considered in the mixed-effects model for Yellow Croaker.\n\nConclusions {#sec016}\n===========\n\nAccording to this study, the condition of Yellow Croaker declined in recent years and was skinny in the south, with worse condition than in the north. The values of condition factor *a* in LWR decreased, when the environmental pollution increased. Therefore, LWR could be a rough indicator for the environment quality. The mixed effects model provided a more convenient and reasonable approach to estimate the spatial and temporal variations of LWR for Yellow Croaker.\n\nSupporting information {#sec017}\n======================\n\n###### Yield of Yellow Croaker in China.\n\nData were derived from *China Fishery Statistical Yearbook* from 1956 to 2012.\n\n(TIF)\n\n###### \n\nClick here for additional data file.\n\n###### Length frequency of Yellow Croaker.\n\n(TIF)\n\n###### \n\nClick here for additional data file.\n\n###### LWR differences of Yellow Croaker among regions and years from the LMEM (R&Y.I&S).\n\na, b, and c were plots among regions; d, e, and f were plots among years. a and d plots cover the whole range of length; b and e plots cover the median part (Length = 12--16 cm); c and f plots cover the large size (Length = 16--22 cm).\n\n(TIF)\n\n###### \n\nClick here for additional data file.\n\n###### Parameters *a* and *b* distributions among regions and years.\n\nA and B plots were parameters variation among regions, with C and D plots among years.
