They comprehensively cover every part of the GCSE specification and each slide shows how it fits into the overall topic context. User-friendly explanations are given and there are lots of examples \u2013 especially useful for Component Two: Computational Thinking paper.\nI highly recommend these resources. I\u2019ve always found the site author easily \u2026\n\nCathryn ArmerHead of ComputingNorthleigh House SchoolEngland\n\nI have found the resources very useful. They are well-thought out, cover the topic content and are suitable for the age range.\n\nMrs ChaudhrySubject Leader for ComputingChiltern Hills AcademyEngland\n\nAbsolutely fantastic resources! It has saved me hours in planning; worth every penny!\n\nWithout the excellent resources from Computer Science UK I would be lost. The presentations, workbooks and assessments ensure that every element of computer science is fully covered even though I teach CIE. Thank you CSUK, brilliant and appreciated work.\n\nMs MatthewsHead of Computer Science/ICTWingate SchoolTenerife\n\nWe are extremely pleased with the resources, there is no need for planning. We are with AQA , however there is enough overlap in the course content for us to utilize the resources.\n\nMs. MirzaTeacherSt.John Payne Catholic SchoolEngland\n\nSome great resources that have made my schemes of work a lot better, well structured and key elements of the curriculum are included\n\nMs HasanTeacherThe Kingsway SchoolEngland\n\nA fantastic set of resources for minimal cost. There are some really great lessons in the Key Stage 3 section.\n\nJamie ChadwickDirector of Technology Enhanced LearningAlderley Edge School for GirlsEngland\n\nThe ComputerScienceUK website has fantastic computer science resources. Easily accessible and easy for the students to follow. The cost is very affordable.\n\nMr BaconTeacherKirkby Stephen Grammar SchoolEngland\n\nAmazing resources that are offered at a more than reasonable price. These resources have saved myself and my colleagues copious amounts of time.\n\nShaun LloydTeacherThorp AcademyEngland\n\nThe ComputerScienceUK website includes a lot of very useful computer science resources for all year groups, which cover topics relevant to the current curriculum. They have saved me a lot of preparation time."
