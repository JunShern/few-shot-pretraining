Clever officer checked both dummies' pulse to make sure!\"\n\n\"Dolls, dummies, pets, infants inside wombs, & ghosts don't count!\" they added.\n\nThe driver in question was also driving on a suspended license, so in addition to facing the $500 HOV violation fine, his car was towed, according to the CHP.\n\nIn the past, others cheaters have brought along creepy mannequins and, in at least one instance, a Chucky doll in order to disguise unauthorized use of the carpool lane. You can see some of the more egregious examples in the gallery above.\n\nWhile the dolls and dummies may not be a common sight, the cheating is: A 2016 study found that nearly a quarter of drivers in the carpool lanes during the morning commute in the Bay Area are there without the requisite number of riders."
