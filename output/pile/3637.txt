They should pay the salaries before they bring the new budget, said lawmaker Kuany Mayom.\n\nAhmed Mohamed Musa, another MP, said the finance ministry should ensure all civil servants are paid before the budget is passed.\n\nMeanwhile, Abuk Payiti Ayiik said most cabinet members were absent during Thursday's sitting, making it difficult for the country's lawmakers to question why civil servants and soldiers are not getting salaries.\n\nEven parliamentarians have gone unpaid for six months, that's why Parliament is asking because oil production has resumed, she said.\n\nThe deputy chairperson for MPs' affairs, Mary Nyayom Lual said they are unhappy because civil servants and soldiers have not been paid for several months.\n\nWhy should we pass another budget when our civil servants and soldiers protecting the country are not getting salaries? she Lual.\n\nThe ministers are busy with trips abroad every year. This is corruption. We want to know how oil revenues are managed in the country, she added.\n\nDhoruai Mabor Teny, a legislator representing Western Lakes state said, Cabinet is trying to joke with the parliament. I don't know how the executive, headed by the president, thought of bringing the budget before MPs when they have not paid salaries for six months.\n\nHe added, And our message is very short, the financial bill will never be tabled before us until the arrears are paid.\n\nOn his part, national assembly speaker, Anthony Lino Makana had to adjourn Thursday's siting to next week.\n\nLast week, the Council of Minister passed a proposed draft budget of 208.156 billion SSP, with allocation of 57% for capital expenditures.\n\nSouth Sudan currently pumps about 175,000 barrels per day of crude oil.\n\nLast month, the Commissioner General of South Sudan Revenue Authority revealed that they collect nearly 4 billion SSP every month.\n\nCategories\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCalendar\n\nAbout\n\nSudan News Gazette\n\nThe \u201cSudan News Gazette\u201d, has been designed to publish news from all the sectors and that shows its attribute of catering to the interest of various kinds of readers, which has also helped it to mark its existence among the African region\u2019s top news website."
