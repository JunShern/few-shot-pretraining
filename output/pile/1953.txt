    "text": "Already a member?\n\nA lot of Europeans think that Russian propaganda does not concern them.\n\nThey think that its provocations are just games and that people like me, who come from former Soviet domains, are victims of old phobias.\n\nThese people are in denial on Russia, whose propaganda has infected European debate like a virus.\n\nWe are already late in trying to react. Some are still not ready to start.\n\nEarlier this year, the European Parliament proposed a modest \u20ac800,000 budget for the East Stratcom Task Force, a counter-propaganda unit in the EU foreign service, but member states struck down the idea in November.\n\nThe task force was also due to grow from 11 people, who are currently seconded by member states, to 16 permanent EU officials, and to expand its mandate from the east to the south, but the EU foreign service hierarchy showed no interest.\n\nStrategic error\n\nPoliticians, especially in France and Italy, tend to underestimate the effect of Russia\u2019s disinformation campaign.\n\nThey are making a strategic mistake if they think that threats to Central and Eastern Europe do not also threaten them.\n\nThe Kremlin, along with jihadist groups, especially the so-called Islamic State (IS), are today the two principal sources of hate speech in Europe.\n\nOn 23 November, the European Parliament adopted a report calling on the EU to react.\n\nWe do not want to fight propaganda with propaganda, but to have an effective communications strategy to expose lies.\n\nRussia reacted furiously to the fact the report mentioned the Kremlin alongside IS.\n\nIt goes without saying that their objectives, tactics and target audiences are different.\n\nThe Kremlin is trying to sway the general public against the West by using TV broadcasters such as RT, online mass media such as Sputnik, and by deploying troll and bot armies on social networks such as Facebook, YouTube and Twitter.\n\nTheir strategies are the same, however. They both want to turn Europeans against their own governments and against liberal values. They are both trying to gain influence in the West by brainwashing people and turning them against each other.\n\nLong reach\n\nThe numbers show the frightening extent of their reach.\n\nThe Kremlin itself has said it doubled media spending from \u20ac630 million last year to \u20ac1.2 billion this year. Some, like Konstantin Borovoy, a former Russian MP who joined the opposition, believe the real figure is much higher.\n\nRT broadcasts in more than 100 countries and can be switched on in almost every hotel room around the world. The troll factory in St Petersburg, where over 300 paid bloggers work around the clock, is also expanding.\n\nAt the same time, the EU estimates that IS has managed to recruit 5,000 Europeans to join its cult.\n\nEU authorities do not tolerate media that incite violence in the name of Islam, but they turn a blind eye to Russian media that incite hatred against refugees.\n\nAre we happy to swallow Russia\u2019s fake stories, such as the lie about Lisa, the German girl who was said to have been raped by asylum seekers, or the lie about the Austrian court that was said to have acquitted a refugee who raped a boy at a swimming pool?\n\nIn this light, Putin\u2019s joke on Russia\u2019s borders is even less funny.\n\nIt underlined the fact that Russia\u2019s viral ideology has penetrated into the heart of Europe and it was meant to mock our legitimate concerns.\n\nUS authorities have also said that Russian information warfare helped the Putin-friendly Donald Trump come to power.\n\nElection risk\n\nThe elections in France and Germany next year could be decisive for the EU\u2019s future.\n\nThe Kremlin-financed National Front party in France can count on massive support from Russian propaganda. The far-right AfD party in Germany, which also stands accused of taking Russian money, can count on the same.\n\nIt is right and proper to defend free speech and media pluralism in Europe.\n\nThese are some of our core values and part of the reason why the Western model continues to be more attractive to the vast majority of people.\n\nIt is also right and proper to draw a line between free speech and premeditated lies, however.\n\nIn these difficult times, the East Stratcom Task Force is an asset.\n\nThe EU foreign service unit, of just 11 people, has, over the past year or so since it began its work, made a genuine impact.\n\nIts staff, of EU officials, diplomats, and former journalists, all of whom are fluent in Russian, is highly professional in its debunking of Kremlin fakery.\n\nIt identified more than 2,000 fake reports in the past 12 months alone. Its Disinformation Review, a weekly newsletter, and its daily tweets and infographics, should be in the laptops and phones of all MEPs and senior EU officials.\n\nCreepy borders\n\nIt\u2019s time to take action.\n\nIt\u2019s time for the EU to fortify projects like East Stratcom, for the EU, for Nato structures, and for individual member states to strike back and to coordinate their activities.\n\nIt\u2019s also time to give more support for independent media that report the truth.\n\nIf we don\u2019t, we risk leaving Putin as the only one laughing, as his borders, both real and ideological, creep further west.\n\nPetras Austrevicius is a Lithuanian MEP and the vice-chairman of the liberal Alde group in the European Parliament\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion piece are the author's, not those of EUobserver."
