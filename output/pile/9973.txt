    "text": "The present invention relates to a portable nature stand, and more particularly to a stand of the type which can be transported into an area such as a forest having many trees and which can be easily mounted in operative position so as to provide a safe and comfortable vantage point from which to observe nature. Such stands are used by photographers or hunters and are often referred to as a deer stand or tree stand.\nStands of this type can, of course, also be employed with upright wooden poles or the like, but the most common use is with trees having a diameter on the order of five inches or more. The stand should be of lightweight construction and be capable of being readily assembled and disassembled without the use of any tools. Nature stands are utilized with trees of many different sizes and configurations. Prior art stands have the disadvantage that they often are not suitable for use with trees having unusual shapes and trees that have many low branches or divided trunks. Furthermore, prior art stands make undesired noises or may have components thereof damaged upon movement of the associated tree caused by wind. It is therefore desirable to eliminate any undesired noises and possible damage to the stand irrespective of movement of the tree to which it is attached."
