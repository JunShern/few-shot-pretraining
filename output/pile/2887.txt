    "text": "1.) The best place for talking about stereotypes.\n\nAnd the best way to defend ourselves is not to have to. For our message and our lives to be so clear and so well-known, that we never have to try to defend ourselves.\n\nThe idea there is that we\u2019re inoculating people against the stereotypes. (When they\u2019re not true, anyway.)\n\nBut that has a major exception: People who don\u2019t know us at all. People whose perceptions are formed by what they see on TV or read on the internet. And something about those venues seems to propagate stereotypes. For instance, \u201cChristians being Christ-like\u201d isn\u2019t likely to make the news. (Even Fox News.) What\u2019s more likely to make the news is when a prominent Christian sticks his foot in his mouth. And then there\u2019s the Internet, where what sticks out are the flame wars and loudmouths.\n\nThat\u2019s probably the best situation for pointing out the stereotypes, assuming we can do it without whining\u2013when we\u2019re dealing with people who just don\u2019t know conservative Christians. (Inoculation works better to prevent stereotypes, than to cure stereotypes.)\n\nStill, though\u2014as much as possible, I want to fix the stereotypes simply by being clearly Christ-like and Christ-honoring in our words and deeds, pointing to Him and the truth He taught.\n\n2.) \u201cBad\u201d stereotypes that aren\u2019t really bad.\n\nSometimes, the \u201cbad\u201d stereotypes are true\u2014but they\u2019re not actually bad! That happens in two ways:\n\nChrist offended a lot of people. If we\u2019re doing everything exactly right, and communicating Him well, then He\u2019s going to offend them through us. Sometimes. (And other times, His goodness & love overwhelms.)\n\nMisunderstood or poorly-done truths. Take evangelism. We\u2019re stereotyped as being into \u201cproselytism\u201d. Which is true. (Depending on your definition of \u201cproselytism\u201d.) But sometimes, the\u201dbad\u201d stereotype comes from evangelism done poorly. Or evangelism misunderstood. (What if people see evangelism as, \u201cJoin my religious club\u201d instead of \u201cKnow and understand Christ, and the stunning grace of what he has done\u201d? What if they see televangelists inviting people to receive Jesus and send in their money?)\n\nSo the answer here is pretty much the same. Speak and live clearly. And make sure that if people are offended, they are being offended by Christ\u2013not by us.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nSummer White is the daughter of Dr. James R. White, of Alpha & Omega Ministries. She recently blogged about an experience at her college, dealing with stereotypes. You might check it out\u2013how well do you think she handled it?\n\nDan Kimball comes from the more conservative wing of the Emerging Church. The title is pretty expressive. I liked this book, though I\u2019m not claiming it\u2019s perfect. (It\u2019s been a while since I read it, so I don\u2019t clearly recall what there might be to criticize.) It\u2019s worth reading, especially if you keep in mind a couple things: (1) The \u201cJesus\u201d people often like is a watered-down Jesus\u2014a pop Jesus who only ever says nice things, except when he\u2019s cutting down religious conservatives. (2) When Kimball talks about areas where people \u201clike Jesus but not the Church\u201d, he is not saying that the church is necessarily doing something wrong there. He does advocate correcting misunderstandings.\n\nIn the previous entry from this series, I mentioned stereotypes\u2014in this case, how conservatives are stereotyped as narrow-minded, as selfish, as hateful, or as smug, Pharisaical, self-righteous judgmental jerks. So\u2026 What do we do with that? How should we respond? (Edit: I\u2019ll say up front that sometimes the stereotypes are true. And I should add that this would apply to dealing with any kind of stereotype\u2013including conservative stereotypes about liberals.)\n\nI have a few thoughts\u2014an overarching perspective, and then a list of miscellaneous points.\n\nIt\u2019s going to involve a combination of words & actions. Words to point out the stereotyping, words to communicate what we mean & believe, and actions in keeping with what we say. I\u2019m not precisely sure what the balance should be between them, but I suspect it should and lean toward latter two. (\u201cThey\u2019re stereotyping us\u201d isn\u2019t an inherently interesting or helpful subject. Talking about Christ, the Gospel, and the Scriptures is\u2014along with acting like Christ.)\n\nAnd the best way to defend ourselves is not to have to. For our message and our lives to be so clear and so well-known, that we never have to try to defend ourselves. For people to be so familiar with us that they know who we are. For us to be so pervasively, consistently Christ-like, clearly communicating the Gospel, that we cannot be unjustly stereotyped.\n\nAnd of course, that assumes that the stereotypes are unjust. Which isn\u2019t always the case! (We all live out stereotypes, sometimes.)\n\nThoughts to ponder:\n\nHow often is there truth in the stereotypes? How often are there real negative experiences behind people\u2019s bad perceptions of Christianity and/or conservatives? How compelling will such people find it when we simply insist that we\u2019re not really like that? (Counter-thought: How often are people oversensitive about their past experience? How often do they use it as an excuse to broadbrush?)\n\nTalking about the stereotypes is limited in its usefulness. \u201cThey\u2019re stereotyping us\u201d is helpful if done right, but we have to be careful that it doesn\u2019t become complaining or whining. After all\u2026if the stereotypes are true, we\u2019ll spend a lot more time & energy decrying \u201cthem dang lib\u2019rals & the lib\u2019ral media\u201d than we\u2019ll spend talking about Christ and bearing fruit in service & love.\n\nIt will be hypocritical for us to complain about the stereotypes, if we don\u2019t do a good job of cleaning house, seeking to be above reproach. I don\u2019t know if actions speak louder than words, but they\u2019re sure important for backing them up. (Along those lines, see the previous entry on service.)\n\nWe need to be clear that we truly see ourselves as fellow sinners in need of a savior. We need to be clear that the Gospel is not, \u201cBecome a church-goer\u2014be better, like us.\u201d That the Gospel is what Christ did for us\u2014the gift of redemption, received by simple, humble, repentant, God-seeking faith.\n\nPaul said in Romans 2, \u201cyou have no excuse, O man, every one of you who judges. For in passing judgment on another you condemn yourself, because you, the judge, practice the very same things.\u201c He\u2019s talking about hypocrisy\u2013doing what you criticize in other people.\n\nRecently I\u2019ve become increasingly aware of how often and how easily we fall into that. With the best of intentions, we can wind up being hypocritical in practically everything. It just slips in under our radar.\n\nExamples\n\n1.) Charity Police\n\nIf you read many blogs on the internet, you will find people who speak very uncharitably\u2013they\u2019re constantly unnecessarily harsh in tone and unreasonable in how they interpret others. You will also find people who are obsessed with accusing others of being uncharitable. You can call them charity police. And those guys can be some of the least charitable people around\u2013accusing others of uncharity at the drop of a hat or the slightest hint of language that isn\u2019t excessively polite. Majorly unreasonable & oversensitive.\n\nWe should be gracious with each other in addressing their mistakes\u2013including mistakes of style. And we shouldn\u2019t be too quick to assume the worst.\n\nCharity police can be the least charitable people on the internet.\n\n2.) Liberals & stereotyping.\n\n(Note: Everyone does this kind of thing, but there\u2019s an extra element of hypocrisy when self-professed liberal people do it.)\n\nAs a general simplification: The Liberal Ideal includes being open-minded & tolerant.\n\nSo it\u2019s particularly unfortunate when a self-described liberal broadbrushes conservatives\u2013as narrow-minded, as selfish, as hateful, or as smug, Pharisaical, self-righteous judgmental jerks. When a liberal thinks in stereotypes, seeing us through the filter of their preconceived ideas about us\u2013without engaging & exploring & knowing us.\n\nIt\u2019s frustrating being pigeonholed by someone who tells you how open-minded they are.\n\n(I think the Prop 8 Musical is a good example of this. More about that in\u2026Uh, I think it\u2019ll be Pt 5. And I think my next entry will discuss what our response should be to this kind of stereotyping.)\n\nUnderlying Problems & Solutions\n\nIn a general sense, this happens because we\u2019re messed-up, sinful people. Even in our attempts to be good or identify good, we get twisted around. And the solution will involve prayer, and humility, and being graceful toward each other when we screw up like this. But I want to try to be a little more specific.\n\nProblem #1: A comfortable lack of introspection\n\nWe start to rest on our laurels. To be comfortable. We form an image of ourselves, and live in the image, unaware of whether we\u2019re living up to it. We stop examining ourselves for consistency. We begin to live without integrity.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t yet, listen to the mp3 of Carson talking about integrity\u2013our struggle when we see that who we are on in the inside isn\u2019t the same as who we try to be on the outside. Here\u2019s the mp3. Go to 1:05:20, and listen for about 4.5 minutes.\n\nSo, accept that you\u2019re going to be a hypocrite sometimes. Commit to finding out where it\u2019s happening. Commit to the struggle. Keep examining yourself against the principles you claim to follow. Work out your salvation with fear and trembling, and commit to the humility of Christ.\n\nProblem #2: Keeping score vs. the Gospel\n\nThe more we compete & try to keep score\u2014winning arguments, or proving our worth\u2014the more likely we are to form lying images in our minds. The more we think that our salvation depends on keeping the rules & being \u201cgood people\u201d, the more likely we are to cling to a positive image of ourselves. And the less likely we are to probe our own life & heart, to find the inconsistencies.\n\nIf we live in a place of freedom\u2014knowing that our hope is based on what Christ did\u2014then it becomes easier to admit the problems, to look for more failures, and ask for grace from God to help us change.\n\nAnd our lives proceed from our hearts. So when we pray for change, we have to pray for a change of heart. It means looking more to the life of Jesus, and falling in love with what we see. The change grows from the longing that God gives us to see his goodness, and taste it in our own lives. The change grows from the belief that it will be worth it to change, even when it\u2019s hard & involves sacrifice. \u201cHe who loses his life for my sake will find it.\u201d\n\nAnd the change will come from God\u2019s strength & goodness, not ours. \u201cFor it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure.\u201d (Phil 2:13) I started this series from Romans 1-2; when we get to Romans 7, we find Paul talking about this kind of struggle with inconsistency. And in Romans 8, we find the words of blessed assurance that if we are in Christ, we will be made more like him\u2013that he will be the firstborn of many brothers. He searches our hearts, and knows what is there, which should be scary\u2013but he is bending all of history, everything in our lives, to change us.\n\n\u201cLikewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness. For we do not know what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words. And he who searches hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, becausethe Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God. And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good,for those who are called according to his purpose. For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified.\u201d (Rom. 8:26-30)\n\nIn the previous entry, I talked about how the Gospel should be at the center of anything we say about homosexuality\u2013and this includes stressing the point that we are all sinners, and no one has the right to feel self-righteous. It\u2019s interesting that Paul makes precisely that point when he talked about it.\n\nRomans 1\n\nPaul talks about homosexuality in Rom. 1:26-27, and then lists other sins in Rom. 1:28-32\u2013like gossip and disobedience to parents. So, I started pointing that out, when I wanted to show that\u2013biblically\u2013homosexuality is a sin among other sins. To show that everyone\u2013including me\u2013stands condemned in the same way. No one can be self-righteous.\n\nIt\u2019s odd. For some reason, I didn\u2019t notice that Paul seems to be making exactly that point. Then recently, it clicked. When he lists \u201cbig\u201d sins with \u201csmall\u201d sins, he almost seems to bait a trap for the smugly self-righteous\u2013letting the readers feel comfortable for a moment, before cutting them low. (Though\u2026 See the P.S. at the end of the entry.)\n\nLately, I\u2019ve been encountering the combined subjects of homosexuality, hypocrisy, and shallow interaction. I started writing one entry on homosexuality in Romans 1-2, but it ballooned, and became too much for one post. So this will be the first in a small series. (Hopefully, I can keep each post terse! It\u2019s hard for me to be brief.)\n\nThe major theme will be \u201cgoing deeper\u201d. Which is pretty tough to do, consistently.\n\nThe Bible & Homosexuality\n\nThe biblical passages on homosexuality evoke strong reactions. Many people see them as harsh & mean-spirited. They\u2019re associated with a self-righteous attitude of condemnation\u2013a mindset that looks down on homosexuals as the worst of all sinners. A mindset that ostracizes and rejects. A mindset that doesn\u2019t understand, \u201cJudge not, lest ye be judged.\u201d\n\nSlogans\n\nThere are standard evangelical responses. The most common soundbite is, \u201cLove the sinner, and hate the sin.\u201d Unfortunately, it has two major problems.\n\nIt\u2019s a slogan\u2013one that\u2019s easy to spit out, regardless of whether there is any love in your life. It\u2019s something Christian kids learn to say, without necessarily learning what it really looks like. So it can sound empty and hollow. Especially if people have been hurt by those who say it without living it.\n\nMore importantly: It almost implies a lie. It almost implies that gay people are sinners\u2013unlike us. It does nothing to counteract the bad assumption that gay people go to hell, but straight people are fine. As though gay people are unique, as sinners, instead of everyone being in the same boat. Self-righteous condemnation.\n\nCanned Answers\n\nThere are better slogans, maybe. (\u201cWe\u2019re all sinners in need of a savior.\u201d \u201cJesus said, \u2018Judge not, lest ye be judged,\u2019 but he also said, \u2018Go and sin no more.\u2019\u201d) Pithy statements can be useful. Canned answers can help. But not when the canned answer reflects canned thinking. Not when the deeper truths aren\u2019t deeply grasped, and lived out. Not when the only thing people hear is canned answers.\n\nSo we need to make sure that we know the truths behind the slogans, and that we live in accord with them. Our lives should be adorning the gospel.\n\nResponding With the Gospel\n\nWhen we talk about homosexuality, at the very core we need to be communicating the gospel. We need to be pointing to the universal need for salvation, and to the work of Christ to save us. To the need for repentance, to the need for trust in him, and to the power & sufficiency of trusting him, apart from any of our efforts to live well.\n\nWe\u2019re sinners in need of a savior. Christians shouldn\u2019t view ourselves as \u201crighteous\u201d, and scorn homosexuals as lowly sinners\u2013everyone is together a sinner. And \u201cnot judging\u201d doesn\u2019t mean that we never say, \u201cThat\u2019s wrong.\u201d Rather, it means not condemning\u2013we speak God\u2019s grace to fellow sinners. In love. There\u2019s no place for self-righteousness. When Christians understand Christ, then we respond with humility and grace and love and the free offer of the gospel. We look with love and care, in part because we know that we ourselves have been forgiven much.\n\nWhen we understand the gospel, we cannot look down on anyone.\n\nWrap-up\n\nWe need to get past slogans. Or we need to put meat on the slogans we profess. It includes communicating the gospel more clearly. That includes rooting out any hint of self-righteousness. It includes avoiding the perception of being noxious, holier-than-thou \u201cReligious Types\u201d, by living out lives of Christ-like, loving, humble service.\n\nMichael Patton over at Parchment and Pen has been doing a series called, \u201cWhy I Am Not Charismatic\u201d. He seems to be roughly in the \u201copen but cautious\u201d area. His thoughts\u2013along with the comment sections\u2013have been well worth the reading time, for anyone trying to think through & understand the subject. (It\u2019s still in-progress, BTW.)\n\nIf you\u2019ve really got a lot of time, I would also recommend the series that Frank Turk (of the Pyromaniacs) wrote this fall. It began with a discussion of John Piper\u2019s response to the Lakeland Revival, and went on from there. Compared to the P&P series, you\u2019ll find that the tone of the discussion there will be a harder line against charismatics. If you\u2019re charismatic, then you\u2019ll probably end up being annoyed or offended at some of the comments. But there\u2019s definitely some thoughtful material there. (Note: He never finished the last post.)\n\nAs a taste, here\u2019s some of what he said in his second post:\n\nI want to start with something I said in the meta a while ago which, I think, people need to keep in mind as we approach the question of how the Holy Spirit works in the church.\n\nMy opinion is that a \u201ccautious\u201d continualist and a \u201ccautious\u201d cessationist have way more in common that they have in contention. They agree that prayer is efficacious; they agree that God is the giver of all good things; they agree that the Christian has a privilege to ask God for his needs; they agree that we should rejoice when God supplies those needs.\n\nThe problem is when someone claims more than that, or less than that. I would say that those who fall outside of those affirmations put themselves in spiritual danger \u2014 a topic about which I am sure I have more I should write down.\n\nAs I\u2019ve looked at the gift of tongues, I\u2019ve found out that there\u2019s a lot to work through. More than you might expect. The questions can get really complex. I want to find the straight-forward answers\u2026 But I want answers that seem to satisfy everything the Bible says about the gift.\n\nI decided to write down all the questions & issues I can identify\u2013every decision you have to make about the subject. What do you have to work through, when you\u2019re studying it? Some of these have to do with the nature of the gift, and others are practical questions. Some are directly exegetical\u2013about understanding a particular passage\u2013and others are more general.\n\nNote: Some of these questions have simple answers. Some seem like they have simple answers, but don\u2019t. And maybe some seem complex to me, but they really aren\u2019t.\n\nAlso Note: I\u2019ve been sitting on this entry for a week or two, tweaking it & improving it. I\u2019m still not entirely happy with it\u2026 There are parts that might not be clear enough. But I can\u2019t keep fiddling forever.\n\nInvitation: If you can think of any additional questions, please, leave a comment. I\u2019d like to make this as exhaustive as possible!\n\nI. Summary: The Biggest Questions\n\nIs the gift of tongues still given today?\n\nCan all believers speak in tongues?\n\nShould all believers speak in tongues?\n\nAre tongues always directed to God, i.e. prayer or praise? Or does it include messages to other people?\n\nThe gift of tongues seems to involve some kind of unlearned language. But is it a heavenly language\u2013a \u201cprivate prayer language\u201d, i.e. glossalalia\u2013or is it speaking in an unlearned human language? Or does it include both?\n\nCan you understand your own gift, when you speak it? Always? Ever?\n\nHow are interpreted tongues to be practiced in church? 1 Cor. 14:28 says, \u201cif there is no one to interpret, let each of them keep silent in church\u201c. How do you know if there\u2019s someone to interpret?\n\nThis spring, when the Lakeland Revival was starting, I thought about writing a post on the general issue of sensationalism, along with \u201cmountaintop experiences\u201d like Christian camps or conferences or events. I didn\u2019t so much want to evaluate Lakeland, as to talk about the proper place of \u201cunusual/sensational\u201d things in the life of the church. I wrote a couple drafts, but never finished one.\n\nCarson did a fantastic job. He didn\u2019t talk about everything there is to say\u2013for instance, he didn\u2019t directly compare the unusual/uncommon work of the Spirit with the regular work of the Spirit in the local church\u2013but I absolutely love what he did say.\n\nIt reminds me of a Sam Storms quote that I heard about second-hand, recently. Something like: Biblical balance means pursuing everything the Bible teaches with exactly as much emphasis and enthusiasm as the Bible teaches us to have.\n\n\u201cRejoice always, pray without ceasing, give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you. Do not quench the Spirit. Do not despise prophecies, but test everything; hold fast what is good. Abstain from every form of evil.\u201d 1 Thess. 5:16-22\n\nPeople typically connect \u201cDo not quench the Spirit\u201d with the next verse, \u201cDo not despise prophecies.\u201d But I wonder if it\u2019s also connected with the preceding verse, \u201cGive thanks in all circumstances\u201d. In other words, is grumbling & complaining\u2013the opposite of thankfulness\u2013a way of quenching the Spirit?\n\nThere seems to be a pretty consistent connection between thankfulness and the Spirit.\n\nThanksgiving is part of being filled with the Spirit:\n\n\u201cAnd do not get drunk with wine, for that is debauchery, but be filled with the Spirit, addressing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody to the Lord with your heart, giving thanks always and for everything to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, submitting to one another out of reverence for Christ.\u201d Eph. 5:18-21\n\nThanksgiving is part of walking in Christ:\n\n\u201cTherefore, as you received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in him, rooted and built up in him and established in the faith, just as you were taught, abounding in thanksgiving.\u201d Col. 2:6-7\n\nThanksgiving is part of the word of Christ dwelling richly in us:\n\n\u201cLet the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, with thankfulness in your hearts to God. And whatever you do, in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.\u201d Col. 3:16-17\n\nSpeaking in tongues can be giving thanks with your spirit:\n\n\u201cOtherwise, if you give thanks with your spirit, how can anyone in the position of an outsidersay \u201cAmen\u201d to your thanksgiving when he does not know what you are saying?\u201d 1 Cor. 14:16\n\nAvoiding grumbling and complaining is part of working out our salvation with fear and trembling, and part of remaining blameless and innocent:\n\n\u201cTherefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, so now, not only as in my presence but much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling,for it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure. Do all things without grumbling or questioning,that you may be blameless and innocent, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and twisted generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world\u201d Phil. 2:12-15\n\nSo, it seems that being filled with the Spirit produces thanksgiving, and grumbling quenches the Spirit.\n\n\u201cYet another issue is a deeply ingrained love of sensationalism and triumphalism, and little knowledge of taking up one\u2019s cross daily. I do not mean to suggest that any gift of tongues, say, or any \u201cprophecy\u201d as defined here, or any miraculous healing, should be ruled out because it might be thought \u201csensational.\u201d To denigrate the \u201csensational\u201d in so sweeping a way, a fairly common ploy among noncharismatics, would surely be to indict Jesus and Paul. Rather, the problem lies in love for sensationalism, in the unbiblical and unhealthy focus upon it. [...] It magnifies the importance of what is, biblically speaking, relatively incidental, while ignoring the weightier matters: righteousness, holiness, justice, love, truth, mercy. It is constantly in danger of sacrificing integrity as the rush towards the sensational pelts on: stories of healings are blown out of proportion, so that the genuine instances are lost in exaggeration and distortion; evangelism loses out to manipulated outbursts of emotion [...]; the straightforward and impassioned message of the cross, proclaimed by a Whitefield, is displaced by endless promises to solve personal problems; and only the Christians whose problems have evaporated and who enjoys perfect health has entered into the fullness of the riches Jesus promises. In the more extreme cases, the triumphalism is carried so far as to promise wealth as well: give your \u201cseed money\u201d to God (i.e., our organization), and watch God multiply it; you are the child of a king\u2013do you not think your heavenly Father wants you to live in royal splendor? Believers who have meditated long on Matthew 10 or John 15:18-16:4, let alone believers in China, will not be impressed by this argument. [emphasis added]\u201c"
