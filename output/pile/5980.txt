You know the type -- the male lead in most young adult novels who is hot and smoldering and (sometimes) supernatural\u2026yet wholly unrealistic. Brooding YA Heroes parodies this jaw-clenching, hair-tousling, secret-keeping archetype to hilarious effect. In honor of these fantastic tweets, we've highlighted some of our favorites.\n1.

Follow us on Twitter and let us know!\nFollow @hollywood_com\n//\nFollow @onthemarquee\n//\n\nChloe Sevigny has made it clear she is not a fan of Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence, dismissing her as \"annoying\" and \"too crass\" in a new interview. The Boys Don't Cry actress was discussing the need for celebrities in Hollywood to have marketable personalities with a reporter for V magazine when she made the comments about The Hunger Games star.\nSevigny said, \"So much is about marketing and selling the product. They'll have a really peppy funny girl on the talk show rounds, and everybody adores her and loves her and wants to be her or f**k her, and then so many more people want to watch the movie or TV show. I understand that star quality, how much value that carries.\"\nShe continued, \"I love when a movie star is a great movie star. I think Angelina Jolie is a great movie star... I like Emma Stone. Whenever she's herself, she's really cute. Jennifer Lawrence I find annoying. Too crass.\"\nIronically, during the candid chat, Sevigny revealed she worries about being too outspoken for her own good, admitting, \"I'm afraid that maybe people think there's more personality than acting ability.\n\"What I did on (TV shows) Big Love, Hit & Miss, and American Horror Story, it's not like I'm just playing the same character over and over again. I would like to be respected more as an actress. It's not like I can complain about anything. I think I've had great opportunities, but you can always have more.\"\n\nPlayed a young widow opposite Bradley Cooper in David O. Russell's \"Silver Linings Playbook\"\n\nPortrayed Mystique in the prequel to the \"X-Men\" film series \"X-Men: First Class\"\n\nReprised her role as Katniss in \"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire\"\n\nCast as Bill Engvall\u2019s unruly teen daughter on TBS family comedy \"The Bill Engvall Show\"; won Outstanding Young Performers in a TV Series at the Young Artist Awards (2009, shared with co-stars Skyler Gisondo and Graham Patrick Martin)\n\nEarned critical raves with a supporting role opposite Charlize Theron and Kim Basinger in \"The Burning Plain\"\n\nStarred in horror thriller \"House at the End of the Street\"\n\nDelivered breakthrough performance as a tough country girl who goes in search of her missing drug-dealing, deadbeat father in \"Winter\u2019s Bone\"\n\nSummary\n\nDespite not having any professional training, Jennifer Lawrence became one of Hollywood's most sought after and respected young actresses within five years of beginning her career. After a fairly typical start on television as a cast member of the family sitcom \"The Bill Engvall Show\" (TBS, 2007-09), she began to show surprising depth with performances in harrowing dramas like \"The Poker House\" (2008) and \"The Burning Plain\" (2008). It was Lawrence's magnetic and astonishingly mature starring turn in the critically acclaimed drama \"Winter's Bone\" (2010) that made critics take notice and elevated her status from rising teen starlet to Oscar-worthy actress. In addition to her continued work in smaller, more intimate films, several big-budget features followed for Lawrence, including a supporting role in the superhero adventure \"X-Men: First Class\" (2011) and the lead in the hugely successful \"The Hunger Games\" (2012) and its sequels, based on the best-selling young adult novels by Suzanne Collins. Also in 2012, the critical darling \"Silver Linings Playbook\" once again made the talented actress a contender for Hollywood's top awards, leading to an Academy Award for Best Actress. Capable of emotionally rich performances and blessed with an undeniable screen presence, Lawrence was well-equipped for a lengthy and diverse career as one of film's premier talents.\n\nEducation\n\nName\n\nNotes\n\n\"What's weird about wrapping a movie is you spend so much time creating a whole other person, then all the sudden you leave. You stop. And that part of your brain, or head, or imagination, doesn't exist anymore.\" \u2013 Lawrence to USA Today, June 9, 2010\n\n\"It's easy to get pigeonholed, so I think it's important that when one thing gets really big \u2013 it's a wise decision to do the opposite.\" \u2013 Lawrence to Teen Vogue, April 2011\n\n\"When we first met in person it was so clear that this girl was going to take over the world. She is charismatic, funny to the bone, and will not suffer fools easily.\" \u2013 Charlize Theron on Lawrence, quoted in Entertainment Weekly, Dec. 7, 2012"
