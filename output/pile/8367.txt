I was expecting that TM would ask me where to put the restored folder (as it has done in the past, IIRC), but this time it didn't, and instead overwrote the folder1.\nThis is definitely not what I wanted.\nIs it possible to undo the TM restore?\n1Bizarrely enough, TM noticed that one subfolder already existed, and asked whether it should overwrite it, keep the latest version, or keep both.  What's bizarre about this is that only one subfolder was selected for such special treatment, out of dozens of subfolders for which it would have been equally applicable.\n\nA:\n\nTwo things might work in your case:\n\nPower off the Mac and hope an unerase utility can recover the files before they get overwritten (assuming the restore didn't write over the existing files on disk).\nDelete the folder and try again from a different Time Machine snapshot.\n\n"
