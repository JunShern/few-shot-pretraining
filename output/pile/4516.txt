did you die?\" \"I don't remember.\" \"How old are you?\" \"Because you could be twenty-something, but you could also be a teenager.\" \" You have one of those faces.\" \" Oh, my God.\" \"And I can't even smell...\" \"You don't smell...\" \"He doesn't smell rotten.\" \" I don't...\" \" Amazing.\" \"Nora, he didn't come here for an interview.\" \"Stop.\" \"Why did you come here, R?\" \"To show everyone...\" \"Show them what?\" \"That we can change.\" \"R, no one here is ever gonna buy that.\" \"Not that we could get you even close enough to tell them.\" \"As soon as they saw you, they would blow your head to bits.\" \"Wait a minute.\" \"Did you say \"we\"?\" \"Lots of us changing.\" \"Dreaming.\" \"That's kind of a big deal.\" \"We have to move fast.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"Boneys chasing me.\" \"They're chasing us.\" \"Okay, we have to go to my dad.\" \"No, that is a very bad idea.\" \"No, Nora, he was a reasonable guy once.\" \"(CHUCKLES) Oh, no, I think you're confused.\" \"It was your mom that was the reasonable one.\" \"It was your dad that grounded you for a year for stealing Peach Schnapps.\" \"Are you serious?\" \"It's your dad that likes to shoot Corpses in the head.\" \"Well, what other choice do we have, Nora?\" \"(SIGHS) Still, we'd have to get him through the city.\" \"Someone would definitely see you.\" \"There isn't much time.\" \"We could fix him up.\" \"What?\" \"I have some makeup that I was saving for a special occasion that obviously isn't gonna happen.\" \"Yeah.\" \"Yeah, we could.\" \"We could put on a little bit of foundation, maybe a little blush.\" \"Probably a lot of blush.\" \"No way.\" \"Yeah, way.\" \"(OH PRETTY WOMAN PLAYING)\" \"Would you change the song, please?\" \"What?\" \"It's funny.\" \"No, it's not.\" \"Fine.\"

\"Say something human.\" \"Say something human.\" \"How are you?\" \"Nailed it.\" \"Over here.\" \"He's fine.\" \"Okay, you guys wait here.\" \"What are you doing here?\" \"What is going on?\" \"What is all this?\" \"I'm not sure, but it's not good.\" \"We've been getting reports there are sizable packs of skeletons and Corpses coming toward us.\" \"We don't know why, but if they're here to attack, there's nothing we can do about it.\" \"Too many of them, too few of us.\" \"So I want you to get home, lock down the house.\" \"I have the gun there, the Ruger SR...\" \"This?\" \"Yeah, okay.\" \"I need to talk to you.\" \" Julie, not now.\" \" Dad, it's important.\" \"This is gonna sound really crazy, but\" \"I think the dead are coming back to life.\" \"That does sound crazy.\" \"They're changing, Dad.\" \"They're...\" \"I don't know.\" \"They're somehow curing themselves.\" \"You think they're curing themselves?\" \"How is that?\" \"I saw it.\" \"It is really happening.\" \"No.\" \"You know what is happening, Julie?\" \"What's happening is every day there are more of them and less of us.\" \"They are not curing themselves.\" \"We're their food source.\" \"They are not becoming vegan.\" \"Okay?\" \"They don't eat broccoli.\" \"They eat brains, your mother's and your boyfriend's included.\" \"Okay?\" \"So I want you to wake up!\" \" I'll explain.\" \" GRIGIO:\" \"Okay?\" \"What do you mean, \"you'll explain\"?\" \"Explain what?\" \"I got this.\" \"Get yourself home.\" \"Barricade yourself in the shelter.\" \"There is enough stuff there that you can open up...\" \"Uh...\" \"Hi.\" \"Who are you?\" \"This is R.\" \"I didn't ask you.\" \"I asked him.\" \"Who are you?\" \"(STAMMERING)\" \"You're a Corpse?\" \"He saved my life.\" \"He took care of me.\" \"I triggered something in him and that must have sparked something in all of them...\" \" Now it's triggered something in me.\" \" JULIE:\" \"No...\" \"Dad !\" \"No!\" \"Dad!\" \"We want to help.\" \"Please, they don't want to attack us.\" \"They want to help.\" \"We're...\" \"We're getting better.\" \"No.\" \"Things don't get better.\" \"Things get worse.\" \"People get bit, then they get infected, then I shoot them in the head.\" \" No, Dad...\" \" That's what happened to your mother, and that's what's gonna happen to him.\" \"(GUN COCKING)\" \"I'm really sorry, Mr. Grigio.\" \"Go.\" \"Get out of here and be safe, no matter what.\" \"Okay?\" \"Julie...\" \"I have to go.\" \"You're not gonna shoot me.\" \"Yes.\" \"Yeah, I will.\" \"Totally.\" \"(PANTING)\" \"Okay.\" \"That could
