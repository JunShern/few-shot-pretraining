Consistently, when you go out walking there is dog fouling.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen mums and dads pushing buggies, having to go through the dirt and then having to wash their buggies\u2019 wheels when they get home.\n\n\u201cI simply cannot understand how some dog owners don\u2019t bring bags, collect their dog excrement and dispose of it properly,\u201d said Cllr Jackman, who stresses that many dog walkers are civically minded but others are spoiling it for everybody.\n\nWalkers in the vicinity of Castletroy\u2019s park have no excuse because Limerick County Council installed a pooper scooper there, she says.\n\nAlong with the Demesne in Newcastle West they were the first ones in the county put in place.\n\nIt has twin benefits as it provides dog owners with poop bags to enable them to clean up after their dogs and dispose of the waste, while at the same time safeguarding public health.\n\nUnfortunately no matter what you do some won\u2019t use them, said Cllr Jackman\n\n\u201cI walk that route regularly and do the full circle. It is a minefield of excrement. Elderly people have slipped and sometimes I\u2019ve seen parents pushing buggies having to go out on the road to get away from it which is very dangerous too,\u201d said Cllr Jackman, who has often raised the issue of dog fouling and the wider problem of littering.\n\nJohn Sheehan, executive engineer Limerick County Council, said new signs were to be erected with information of the fines for dog fouling.\n\nMeanwhile, Cllr Noel Gleeson said dumping of rubbish in the county is \u201crampant\u201d while Cllr Eddie Wade said the dumping was \u201cunreal\u201d.\n\nHe has seen everything from a dead pony to mattresses to black bin bags dumped near his home.\n\nYou can contact us using the details below:Limerick Leader,54 O'Connell Street,LimerickEmail: news@limerickleader.ieTelephone: 061 214500\n\nThis website and its associated newspaper are full participating members of the Press Council of Ireland and supports the Office of the Press Ombudsman.
