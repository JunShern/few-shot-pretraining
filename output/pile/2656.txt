The day will finish with a grand finale where different groups will gather for a mass performance and we\u2019ll send you more details of that closer to the time. Get the date in your diaries. We'll be doing a more public announcement about this later, so please don't post it on social media yet, so we can make a proper splash about it closer to the time - thanks!\n\nWith just over a week to go to the Breaking the Frame2 Gathering there are still a few places left, but book soon if you want a bed rather than your tent! We have an exciting programme with speakers from campaign groups, academics and writers. Breaking the Frame is not just another summer gathering (although there will be plenty of time to relax and enjoy yourself) - it's an innovative effort to rethink our approach to the crucial issue of technology, by learning from each other and drawing on everyone's insights and experience. Neither is it just another political event focused on problems - we will be thinking together about how to gain democratic control of technology and what sort of future we want. So, if you care about the politics of technology, whether it's GM food, surveillance, renewable energy, women and digital technology, or designer babies; whether you're a technology politics campaigner, trade unionist, environmentalist, critical scientist, developer of alternative technology, artist or plain concerned citizen; Breaking the Frame2 is not to be missed. Come and help us change the debate on technology.\n\n3) 19th-24th August, 2015 (Wed-Mon)EARTH FIRST SUMMER GATHERING At a rural site in the Derbyshire Peak District (TBC)The EF! Summer Gathering is 5 days of workshops, networking and planning actions at a low impact eco-living camp organised non-hierarchically. It's run without leaders by everyone who comes along, so come prepared to chip in! Five days of skill-sharing for grassroots ecological direct action - make links, share ideas, and get involved in the struggles against fracking, new roads and more. The Gathering will be camping at a rural site (accessible by public transport) so you'll need to bring a tent, sleeping bag, torch and suchlike. Meals are provided by the Gathering's collective kitchen and there'll be a snack shop. Everyone is crew, so the site, including toilets and running water, will be run by us all. Contact : summergathering@earthfirst.org.uk http://earthfirstgathering.org/That's all for now so fill in 13th September in your diary and go and get your tent ready!\n\nPlease contact P.Murry at yrrumuk@googlemail.com if you are interested.\n\nGREEN LEFT FRINGE AT AUTUMN CONFERENCE 2012\n\nBoth Green Left and the Green Party Trade Union Group applied to have fringes at the Green Party Conference September 7-10 2012, Conferences Committee turned down both these requests.
