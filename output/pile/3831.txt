    "text": "Tuatha Traits\n\nThough the tuatha bloodlines are varied, they are all linked by their fey blood. Your tuatha character has several traits in common with all other tuatha.\n\nAbility Score Increase. Your Dexterity score increases by 1.\n\nAge. Tuatha mature at the same rate as humans and reach maturity in their late teens. However, they can live much longer than humans do, up to 250 years.\n\nAlignment. The tuatha prefer to live by their own rules, and as such are often chaotic. Their temperaments can vary wildly, just like the heroes and villains of a storybook. There are just as many good tuatha as there are evil.\n\nSize. Tuatha stand at about the same height as humans, ranging from 5 to 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium.\n\nDarkvision. Due to your fey blood, you can easily see in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can\u2019t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\n\nShapechanger's Physique. You are proficient in your choice of the Acrobatics skill or the Athletics skill.\n\nBeast Shape. You can use your action to magically transform into a Tiny beast of Challenge Rating 0 that does not have a flying or swimming speed. You can remain in this form indefinitely, and can revert to your normal form as a bonus action, and automatically revert to your natural form when you are rendered unconscious. While you are transformed in this way, your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of your chosen form, but you retain your current and maximum hit points, as well as your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain each of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, unless the form you assume already has proficiency in that skill or saving throw.\n\nYou can\u2019t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to those actions your chosen form may take. You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race or other source and can use them if your current form is physically capable of doing so. When you transform, you choose whether your equipment and anything you are carrying falls to the ground or merges into your new form. Any equipment that merges into your new form has no effect until you leave that form.\n\nLanguages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Sylvan.\n\nSubrace. Though the tuatha are borne from ancient lineage, over the ages three bloodlines have emerged: selkies, swanmays, and the storied. Choose one of these subraces.\n\nSelkie\n\nAs a selkie, you live equally between the land and sea. Tougher than most tuatha, you can transform into aquatic creatures. Selkies are sometime sought after by sailors and fisherman, as they are seen as good luck. As such, many selkies search out remote islands and beaches to make their home in peace. However, some adventurous selkies travel the roads and the tides of the world to experience all its wonders.\n\nAbility Score Increase. Your Constitution score increases by 2.\n\nNatural Swimmer. You can hold your breath for a number of minutes equal to your Constitution score. Additionally, you have advantage on Athletics checks made to swim.\n\nSeal Skin. Whenever you finish a long rest, you gain temporary hit points equal to your level.\n\nBeasts Beneath the Waves. When you use your Beast Shape feature to transform into a beast, you can assume the form of a Tiny beast with a swim speed, or the form of a seal."
