But this is only part of add-on and if it's not installed, those variables aren't outputted. Is there anyway I can output these variables without ChannelFiles?\nBackground: There are certain fields that I only want to ever appear when editing a specific entry so I include a bit of jquery in the field instruction to hide/show field by checking against the variables outputted by ChannelFiles add-on in the script tag.\nhttp://imagebin.org/258416\nThanks \nUPDATE (to clarify): I need this when editing the entry in the control panel of EE (see Background section on why) and not in the front end. As far as I know, I don't have access to the templates for the control panel (or do I?).\n\nA:\n\nYou can output entry ids from within the channel:entries tag pair like this:\n{exp:channel:entries channel=\"my_channel\"}\n  entry_id: {entry_id}<br>\n{/exp:channel:entries\n\nThe Channel Entries documenation at EllisLab provide all the variable options available to you.\nUpdate\nYou can add this script to any of the field's Field Instructions section.\n<script>\n  $(document).ready(function() {\n    entryId = (document.URL).split('entry_id=')[1].replace(/\\D/g,'');\n    $('.heading h2').append(' #' + entryId); // adds to heading at top of form\n    alert(\"entry id = \" + entryId);\n  });\n</script>\n\nSecond Update\nThe previous script wasn't removing numerical characters from the url that occurred after the entry_id. The problem is that EE encodes the & as &amp;. So here's this:\n<script>\n  $(document).ready(function() {\n    firstPart = (document.URL).split('entry_id=')[0];\n    entryId = (document.URL).split('entry_id=')[1].split(firstPart[firstPart.length -1])[0];\n    $('.heading h2').append(' #' + entryId);\n  });\n</script>\n\n"
