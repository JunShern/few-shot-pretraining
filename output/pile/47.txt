(all in php)\nHow to do that? I don't need to store the files only links into the database.\nBest regards,\n\nA:\n\nI don't know why you would need wget.\nYou could use curl to go to the website and get the new link.  After you have the link, just store the information in the database and your done.\nYou are basically scrapping other sites for content.\nThis article looks like it is promising:\nhttp://www.merchantos.com/makebeta/php/scraping-links-with-php/\nYou could also try to search google.  I used the term:\nscrapping site php curl\nHave fun.\nRegards.\n\n"
