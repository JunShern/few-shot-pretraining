    "text": "Former Respect MP announces he has begun legal proceedings to have result of Bradford West election set aside\n\nGeorge Galloway has said that he has begun legal proceedings to overturn the election result in Bradford West, after he lost by more than 11,000 votes to the Labour candidate, Naz Shah.\n\nLabour called the former Respect MP \u201cpathetic\u201d after he said he was hoping to get Shah debarred as an MP. Galloway accused her of lying about him on Urdu television and of falsely claiming to have been forced into marriage at 15.\n\nGalloway also claims to have uncovered \u201cwidespread malpractice\u201d in the battle for Bradford West, including postal voting fraud.\n\nThe Bradford West contest was dogged by claims and counter-claims between Labour and Respect over a number of issues, especially relating to Shah\u2019s family background.\n\n\n\nShah \u2013 who won the seat on a 29.7% swing from Respect, polling 19,977 votes to Galloway\u2019s 8,557 \u2013 has vowed to sue Galloway for calling the circumstances of her marriage into question.\n\nGeorge Galloway loses Bradford West seat to Labour's Naz Shah Read more\n\nAnnouncing his legal bid to overturn the election result, Galloway said: \u201cIt has come to my notice that there has been widespread malpractice in this election, particularly over postal voting. We are in the process of compiling the information which will form part of our petition to have the result set aside.\u201d\n\nGalloway has also added to a previous complaint he had made under section 106 of the Representation of the People Act 1983, which concerns false statements made with the intention of affecting the result of an election.\n\n\n\n\u201cAn allegation made by Naz Shah in Urdu on a well-watched Asian TV show is both untrue and extremely serious,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Respect party, Shah alleged on the TV programme that Galloway had travelled to Pakistan and posed as her dead father to obtain her nikah, an Islamic wedding certificate.\n\nBefore polling day, Galloway made a complaint to the director of public prosecutions about the authenticity of a nikah that Shah produced during the campaign to prove she was forced to marry her cousin in Pakistan when she was just 15.\n\nIn a dramatic moment during hustings last month, Galloway produced a nikah which he claimed showed she actually married the cousin when she was 16. He later admitted he had sent an intermediary in Pakistan to obtain it.\n\nGeorge Galloway may have lost his seat \u2013 but this isn\u2019t the last we\u2019ll see of him Read more\n\nIn a personal piece widely shared on social media following her last-minute selection as Labour\u2019s prospective parliamentary candidate in March, Shah referred to her \u201cown forced marriage through emotional blackmail when I was just 15 years old whilst in Pakistan\u201d.\n\nThe Guardian understands the Respect party has spoken to one of Shah\u2019s paternal uncles who said he was not at the Islamic wedding ceremony Shah claims to have had in Pakistan on 25 December 1988, when she was 15. He is said to be the only surviving witness listed on the 1988 nikah.\n\nRespect claims there are are \u201cother discrepancies\u201d on the 1988 document and says the Labour party was informed of this prior to the election.\n\nA Labour spokesman said of Galloway\u2019s legal action: \u201cThis is pathetic and without any foundation. George Galloway should accept he was booted out by the people of Bradford West. They saw through his divisive politics and made a positive choice, by a majority of well over 11,000, to elect a brilliant new MP, Naz Shah.\u201d\n\nGalloway was reported to police on Thursday after he sent a tweet about exit polls before voting closed, which is banned under election law.\n\n\n\nConceding defeat in the early hours of Friday morning, Galloway said: \u201cI don\u2019t begrudge the Labour members here their moment of celebration, of course.\n\n\u201cBut there will be others who are already celebrating: the venal, the vile, the racists and the Zionists will all be celebrating. The hyena can bounce on the lion\u2019s grave but it can never be a lion and in any case, I\u2019m not in my grave. As a matter of fact, I\u2019m going off now to plan the next campaign.\u201d\n\nGalloway claimed last week that he was going to sue a number of media organisations for defamation, along with his former parliamentary assistant, Aisha Ali-Khan, who was jailed for contempt last year.\n\n"
