As I noted in the introduction, the issues and arguments are not linear, but my explanation of them is. So if there's something that seems to build upon an earlier point or is confusing because it glosses over something, I probably explained it when looking at an earlier argument - just scroll up or go back and read from the beginning. (The arguments are presented in written order here.)"
