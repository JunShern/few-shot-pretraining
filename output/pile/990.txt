The trial court sentenced defendant to a prison term of 15 to 30\nyears for each conviction, to be served concurrently. We affirm.\n\n       The 43-year-old defendant was convicted of sexually abusing JV, the daughter of his\nformer live-in girlfriend, in their family home in St. Clair County. Defendant began dating JV\u2019s\nmother in 1992, when JV was two years old. Defendant and JV\u2019s mother thereafter had two\nchildren of their own. JV, aged 25 at the time of trial, testified that from ages 11 to 19, defendant\ncontinuously engaged her in sexual acts. JV testified that defendant penetrated her vagina with\nhis penis and engaged her in oral and anal sex. The sexual assaults began in 2001, when the\nfamily lived in Oklahoma. The four charged offenses occurred in October 2005 through June\n2006, when then 15-year-old JV and her family lived in St. Clair County. In June 2006,\ndefendant and JV\u2019s mother separated, and JV, and her two younger half-siblings, moved with\ndefendant from St. Clair County.\n\n       At age 16, JV became pregnant by defendant, and she gave birth to a son in March 2007.\nBy this time, defendant, JV, and other members of defendant\u2019s family had moved to Tennessee.\nAt age 18, JV again became pregnant by defendant, and their second child was born in April\n2009. In 2010, JV and her two children returned to Michigan. JV ultimately disclosed the\nincidents to a counselor and then made a complaint to the St. Clair police in March 2011.\nDefendant was not arrested until 2015. In the interim, defendant and JV had some\ncommunications, and JV allowed defendant to take their children to Tennessee in 2014. The\ndefense theory at trial was that defendant did not do anything inappropriate and that JV\u2019s\ntestimony was not credible. At trial, defendant maintained that he first had sex with JV when she\n\n\n\n\n                                                -1-\n\fwas 16 years old, which was consensual, and did not engage in any other sexual acts with her\nuntil they began a consensual relationship when she was 18 years old.\n\n                                    I. PREARREST DELAY\n\n        Defendant first argues that his right to due process was violated because the four-year\ndelay between the reporting of the offenses in 2011, and his arrest in 2015, caused substantial\nprejudice to his ability to defend himself. He argues that the trial court erred in denying his\nmotion to dismiss based on this issue.1 \u201cA prearrest delay that causes substantial prejudice to a\ndefendant\u2019s right to a fair trial and that was used to gain tactical advantage violates the\nconstitutional right to due process.\u201d People v Woolfolk, 304 Mich App 450, 454; 848 NW2d 169\n(2014). \u201cDefendant must present evidence of actual and substantial prejudice, not mere\nspeculation.\u201d Id. To be substantial, the prejudice to the defendant must have meaningfully\nimpaired his ability to defend against the charges such that the outcome of the proceeding was\nlikely affected. People v Patton, 285 Mich App 229, 237; 775 NW2d 610 (2009). Mere\nspeculation that the delay caused lost memories, witnesses, or evidence does not establish actual\nand substantial prejudice. Woolfolk, 304 Mich App at 454. If a defendant establishes actual and\nsubstantial prejudice, the prosecution then bears the burden of establishing that the reason for the\ndelay was sufficient to justify that prejudice. Patton, 285 Mich App at 237.\n\n         Defendant claims that he was prejudiced by the four-year delay because he lost text\nmessages, cards, and \u201clove letters\u201d from JV that could have undermined her claim that she feared\ndefendant. Initially, defendant contends that those communications were made between 2010\nand 2015. The four-year delay would not have affected his efforts to retrieve any of the later\ncommunications. More significantly, defendant has not demonstrated substantial prejudice. The\nunavailability of evidence alone is insufficient to show that defendant suffered actual and\nsubstantial prejudice, Woolfolk, 304 Mich App at 454, and defendant has made no showing that\nevidence that JV communicated favorably with him between 2010 and 2015 would have\nexonerated him. Indeed, the defense used other means to argue that JV was not fearful of\ndefendant, including the fact that she chose to live with him over her mother, began a\nrelationship with him after she turned 18, allowed him to take physical custody of their children,\nand gave him and his wife tattoos. The loss of the letters, assuming they existed, is not sufficient\nto satisfy the actual and substantial prejudice requirement.\n\n        Defendant also claims that he was prejudiced by the delay because of the death of his\nsister, Cynthia McElhaney. Defendant indicates that Cynthia, who lived in the same household\nas defendant and JV at certain periods, would have \u201ctestified regarding the complainant\u2019s\nveracity.\u201d Preliminarily, defendant fails to indicate when Cynthia died. Moreover, Cynthia was\n\n\n1\n  Whether a prearrest delay violated a defendant\u2019s right to due process is reviewed de novo.\nPeople v Reid (On Remand), 292 Mich App 508, 511; 810 NW2d 391 (2011). We review a trial\ncourt\u2019s ruling regarding a motion to dismiss for an abuse of discretion. People v Lewis, 302\nMich App 338, 341; 839 NW2d 37 (2013). An abuse of discretion occurs when the trial court\u2019s\ndecision falls outside the range of reasonable and principled outcomes. Id. (quotations and\ncitation omitted).\n\n\n\n                                                -2-\n\fonly one of several relatives who lived in the same household. The defense presented several of\nthe other live-in relatives, including a different sister, an adult nephew, and defendant\u2019s daughter,\nwho testified about their observations and opinions that JV was not truthful. The record fails to\ndisclose that Cynthia\u2019s unavailability impaired defendant\u2019s ability to defend against the charges\nto an extent that the outcome of the proceeding was likely affected.\n\n       Defendant lastly argues that he was prejudiced by the delay because of his own inability\n\u201cto remember the names of potential witnesses who knew [JV] during the relevant times at issue\nand who could offer testimony regarding the veracity of [JV].\u201d But again, general allegations of\nprejudice caused by delay, such as the unspecified loss of memory, are insufficient to show that a\ndefense was affected. Woolfolk, 304 Mich App at 454. Defendant has failed to show that his\nalleged loss of memory resulted in any meaningful impairment of his defense. The trial court did\nnot abuse its discretion in denying defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss based on the prearrest delay.\n\n                                 II. OTHER ACTS EVIDENCE\n\n       Defendant argues that the trial court erred by admitting evidence of other uncharged acts\nthat occurred when JV was between 11 and 15 years old, contrary to MCL 768.27a and MRE\n404(b).2 MCL 768.27a provides that \u201cin a criminal case in which the defendant is accused of\ncommitting a listed offense against a minor, evidence that the defendant committed another listed\noffense against a minor is admissible and may be considered for its bearing on any matter to\nwhich it is relevant.\u201d In this narrow context, evidence of a defendant\u2019s propensity to commit a\ncrime is permitted, so long as it does not violate MRE 403. People v Watkins, 491 Mich 450,\n470, 481-483; 818 NW2d 296 (2012); MRE 401.\n\n       MRE 403, excludes relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed\nby the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by\nconsiderations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\nMRE 403; Watkins, 491 Mich at 481. Unfair prejudice exists where there is \u201ca danger that\nmarginally probative evidence will be given undue or pre-emptive weight by the jury\u201d or \u201cit\nwould be inequitable to allow the proponent of the evidence to use it.\u201d People v Mills, 450 Mich\n61, 75-76; 537 NW2d 909 (1995), mod 450 Mich 1212 (1995); People v McGuffey, 251 Mich\nApp 155, 163; 649 NW2d 801 (2002). When applying MRE 403 to evidence in the context of\nMCL 768.27a, \u201ccourts must weigh the propensity inference in favor of the evidence\u2019s probative\nvalue rather than its prejudicial effect.\u201d Watkins, 491 Mich at 487. Courts should consider the\nfollowing factors when deciding whether to exclude other-acts evidence under MRE 403 as\nbeing overly prejudicial:\n\n\n\n\n2\n  The trial court ruled that the other acts evidence was admissible under MRE 404(b) or MCL\n768.27a. However, as we observed in People v Smith, 282 Mich App 191, 205; 772 NW2d 428\n(2009), where, as here, a listed offense is at issue, analysis of whether the other acts evidence is\nadmissible \u201cbegins and ends with MCL 768.27a.\u201d We review a trial court\u2019s decision to admit\nevidence for an abuse of discretion. People v Burns, 494 Mich 104, 110; 832 NW2d 738 (2013).\n\n\n\n                                                -3-\n\f                (1) the dissimilarity between the other acts and the charged crime, (2) the\n        temporal proximity of the other acts to the charged crime, (3) the infrequency of\n        the other acts, (4) the presence of intervening acts, (5) the lack of reliability of the\n        evidence supporting the occurrence of the other acts, and (6) the lack of need for\n        evidence beyond the complainant\u2019s and the defendant\u2019s testimony. [Id. at 487-\n        488.]\n\nWhen weighing probative value of other-acts evidence, courts should also consider the extent to\nwhich the other-acts evidence supports the victim\u2019s credibility and rebuts any defense attack on\nthe victim\u2019s credibility. Id. at 491-492.\n\n        In the present case, the other uncharged acts were relevant to defendant\u2019s propensity to\ncommit the charged offenses, and to assist the jury in weighing JV\u2019s credibility. The evidence\ngave the jury an intelligible presentation of the interaction between defendant and JV over the\nyears, and the context of their relationship, to provide the \u201ccomplete story,\u201d especially where\ndefendant claimed that he first engaged in sexual intercourse with JV when she, at age 16,\nunexpectedly initiated sexual contact with him, which was when he impregnated her, and then\ndid not have sexual contact with her again until she was age 18. Thus, the probative value of the\nother acts evidence was high.\n\n        Defendant argues that this evidence was far more prejudicial than probative because the\nuncharged acts \u201coccurred so long ago.\u201d The trial court properly considered this argument and\ndetermined that, while \u201csomewhat dated that in and of itself is not a sufficient reason to\novercome the admission of that particular evidence . . . under the statutory provision.\u201d We agree,\nand further observe that, although the other uncharged acts could be considered \u201coutdated\u201d as\nthey relate to the date of trial, there is no temporal divide between the other acts and the charged\noffenses, which occurred in 2005 and 2006. Defendant further contends that the evidence is\nunduly prejudicial because the jury likely focused on and convicted him based on those\nuncharged acts, which occurred when JV was younger. However, the prosecutor focused on the\nproper purpose for which the evidence was admissible. In its final instructions, the trial court\ngave a cautionary instruction to the jury concerning the proper use of the evidence, thereby\nlimiting the potential for unfair prejudice. Given the highly probative value of the other-acts\nevidence, the probative value was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\n\n                                 III. MOTION FOR A MISTRIAL\n\n        Defendant argues that the trial court abused its discretion by denying his motion for a\nmistrial after a potential juror, who was removed, commented that he had interacted with\ndefendant through his employment at the Intervention Center.3 Defendant\u2019s specific claim is that\nthe potential juror\u2019s comments denied him his right to the presumption of innocence. A\n\n\n3\n  A trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion for a mistrial is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. People v\nSchaw, 288 Mich App 231, 236; 791 NW2d 743 (2010). A mistrial should be granted \u201conly for\nan irregularity that is prejudicial to the rights of the defendant and impairs his ability to get a fair\ntrial.\u201d Id. (citation omitted).\n\n\n\n                                                  -4-\n\fdefendant has a right to a fair and impartial jury. People v Stokes, 312 Mich App 181, 187; 877\nNW2d 752 (2015). To show the denial of a fair and impartial jury in this context, a defendant\nmust show that the jury was exposed to extraneous influences and that the extraneous influences\ncreated a real and substantial possibility that those influences could have had an effect on the\njury\u2019s verdict. Id. Due process only demands that jurors act with a \u201clack of partiality, not an\nempty mind.\u201d People v Jendrzejewski, 455 Mich 495, 519; 566 NW2d 530 (1997).\n\n         Defendant has not met his burden for relief. Although the potential juror\u2019s brief\ncomments indicated that defendant was housed at the Intervention Center, they provided no\nadditional information. The trial court instructed the jury on the presumption of innocence in its\npreliminary instructions and further discussed the presumption of innocence during voir dire\n(after the juror had been excused) as defense counsel questioned a different juror about his\nunderstanding that defendant did not need to prove his innocence, noting that the presumption is\na \u201clegal requirement.\u201d4 The jurors who remained explicitly indicated that they could be fair and\nimpartial. The trial court again instructed the jury of the presumption of innocence in its final\ninstructions and reminded the jury that it took an oath to decide the case based only on the\nproperly admitted evidence and the law as instructed by the court. Given the evidence presented\nin this case, we see no basis to conclude that the revelation that defendant was in custody caused\nhis conviction. For these reasons, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that the\nprospective juror\u2019s comments were not grounds for a mistrial.\n\n                  IV. JV\u2019S MOTHER\u2019S FIFTH AMENDMENT PRIVILEGE\n\n        Defendant also argues that the trial court erred by excusing JV\u2019s mother from testifying\nwithout properly determining whether she had a valid Fifth Amendment privilege against self-\nincrimination. The Fifth Amendment provides that no person shall be compelled in any criminal\ncase to be a witness against himself or herself. People v Wyngaard, 462 Mich 659, 671; 614\nNW2d 143 (2000). A witness may invoke \u201cthe constitutional privilege against self-\nincrimination\u201d when a reasonable basis exists \u201cfor [the] witness to fear incrimination from\nquestions.\u201d People v Dyer, 425 Mich 572, 578; 390 NW2d 645 (1986). Regarding the proper\nprocedure for when a witness intends to assert the privilege against self-incrimination, the\nprosecutor must inform the court, outside the presence of the witness and the jury, of the possible\nneed for the witness to be informed of her Fifth Amendment rights. Dyer, 425 Mich at 578 n 5.\nThen, \u201cthe judge must hold a hearing outside the jury\u2019s presence to determine if the witness\u2019\nprivilege is valid, explaining the privilege to the witness.\u201d People v Gearns, 457 Mich 170, 202;\n577 NW2d 422 (1998), overruled in part on other grounds in People v Lukity, 460 Mich 484,\n492-494; 596 NW2d 607 (1999). \u201cIf the court determines the assertion of the privilege to be\nvalid, the inquiry ends and the witness is excused.\u201d People v Paasche, 207 Mich App 698, 709;\n525 NW2d 914 (1994).\n\n       The record reveals that the trial court complied with the applicable procedure and\nproperly concluded that JV\u2019s mother could not be compelled to be called as a witness. During\n\n\n4\n  The purpose of voir dire is to expose potential juror bias so that a defendant may be tried by a\nfair and impartial jury. People v Sawyer, 215 Mich App 183, 186; 545 NW2d 6 (1996).\n\n\n\n                                                -5-\n\fJV\u2019s cross-examination testimony, defense counsel elicited that JV\u2019s mother knew about\ndefendant engaging in sexual acts with her and that her mother had actually participated in some\nof the sexual acts with defendant and JV when JV was approximately 14 years old. After the\ncompletion of JV\u2019s testimony, the prosecutor informed the court that JV\u2019s mother would assert\nher privilege against self-incrimination if she testified at trial. The trial court held a hearing and\noffered to appoint counsel for JV\u2019s mother, which she refused. JV\u2019s mother stated that she\nunderstood her privilege and was firm on her decision not to testify. Although defendant\ncomplains that the trial court did not question JV\u2019s mother concerning the validity of her\nassertion of the privilege against self-incrimination, the court was well aware that JV had\nimplicated her mother as being complicit in some of the sexual assaults. It was evident from\nJV\u2019s testimony that her mother had a \u201creasonable basis . . . to fear incrimination from\nquestions[.]\u201d Dyer, 425 Mich at 578. Under the Fifth Amendment, \u201ctestimony having even a\npossible tendency to incriminate is protected against compelled disclosure.\u201d People v Lawton,\n196 Mich App 341, 346; 492 NW2d 810 (1992). Accordingly, the trial court did not err in ruling\nthat JV\u2019s mother had a valid Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and,\naccordingly, did not abuse its discretion when it excused her as a witness.\n\n                        V. INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL\n\n       Defendant argues that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel at trial because\ndefense counsel failed to adequately impeach JV\u2019s trial testimony with her prior inconsistent\ntestimony at the preliminary examination. 5 \u201cTo demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel, a\ndefendant must show that his or her attorney\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of\nreasonableness under prevailing professional norms and that this performance caused him or her\nprejudice.\u201d People v Nix, 301 Mich App 195, 207; 836 NW2d 224 (2013) (citation omitted).\n\u201cTo demonstrate prejudice, a defendant must show the probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors,\nthe result of the proceedings would have been different.\u201d Id. Decisions regarding how to\nimpeach witnesses and what questions to ask are matters of trial strategy, People v Rockey, 237\nMich App 74, 76; 601 NW2d 887 (1999), and we \u201cwill not second-guess defense counsel\u2019s\njudgment on matters of trial strategy.\u201d People v Benton, 294 Mich App 191, 203; 817 NW2d\n599 (2011).\n\n        Defendant complains that defense counsel failed to adequately challenge JV\u2019s trial\ntestimony with inconsistencies in her prior testimony regarding her motive for ultimately\nreporting defendant in 2011. As defendant observes, JV initially testified at trial that she\nreported defendant because her counselor encouraged her to do so. On cross-examination, using\nJV\u2019s preliminary examination testimony, the following exchange occurred:\n\n              Defense counsel: Now, do you recall being asked and maybe I should ask\n       you now in 2011 why did you feel compelled to make this complaint to law\n       enforcement?\n\n\n5\n  Because defendant did not raise an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in the trial court, our\nreview of this issue is limited to mistakes apparent on the record. People v Heft, 299 Mich App\n69, 80; 829 NW2d 266 (2012).\n\n\n\n                                                 -6-\n\f       JV: Because I had got myself a counselor and I talked to her about\neverything that happened to me and she showed me that basically that it was\nwrong what he\u2019d done. So, I went ahead and I called up our, I went ahead and I\nwent to the Wayne County Police Department and they told me I had to come up\nhere.\n\n       Defense counsel: So you\u2019re telling me that the primary reason why you\nreported this in 2011 was because of your counselor, correct?\n\n       JV: Correct, but it was my choice to do it cause I wanted to.\n\n       Defense counsel: Do you remember me asking you in July why you\nreported this in 2011, and do you recall what your answer was?\n\n       JV:   No, I don\u2019t.\n\n       Defense counsel: So I\u2019m going to show you page 43. . . .\n\n                                            ***\n\n       JV: Yes, I remember saying that.\n\n      Defense counsel: So when I asked you in July of 2015 why you felt\ncompelled to report this to the Sheriff\u2019s Department what was your response?\n\n       JV: My, do I read it?\n\n       Defense counsel: Well, if it refreshes your memory you can tell me what\nyour response was?\n\n       JV: Oh, because of the mean and threatening phone calls I was receiving.\n\n       Defense counsel: So you reported this because [defendant] was calling\nyou and threatening you\u2014\n\n       JV: Uh-hum.\n\n       Defense counsel: \u2014in March of 2011?\n\n       JV: Yes.\n\n       Defense counsel: And what was he threatening you about, taking the\nchildren?\n\n        JV: He, I don\u2019t exactly remember what he was threatening, but he would\nget, he would get violent over the phone, threat\u2014there was one time I got\nthreatened to where I, he\u2019d come up here and I\u2019d get hurt or something like that. I\ncan\u2019t remember what the conversation was about. And I just got tired of it. And I\n\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\f       just got tired of that. And that\u2019s why I cut off all contact with him and didn\u2019t let\n       my kids talk to him or anything.\n\n        Defendant acknowledges this exchange, but contends that defense counsel allowed JV to\navoid her exact prior testimony that defendant threatened to take the children and that \u201cshe was\ntired of the drama.\u201d Defendant provides additional questions that he contends defense counsel\nshould have asked JV, such as using her prior testimony that some of the sexual assaults\noccurred in defendant\u2019s room to challenge her trial testimony that all of the sexual assaults\noccurred in her bedroom.\n\n          The record demonstrates that defense counsel used JV\u2019s prior testimony to discredit her\nat trial, even if he did not ask each question that defendant now suggests. When defendant raised\nthis complaint at sentencing, the trial court observed that defense counsel \u201cpointed out numerous\ninconsistencies which gave the jury the ability to adequately and fully assess the credibility of\n[JV]\u201d, an observation that the record bears out. In addition to inconsistencies in her own\ntestimony, defense counsel cross-examined JV about inconsistencies in her testimony and the\nstatements she made to the police, and called the initial interviewing officer as a defense witness.\nIn closing argument, defense counsel highlighted those inconsistences to argue that JV was not\ncredible. In addition to eliciting inconsistencies, defense counsel emphasized that JV chose to\ncontinue living with defendant, as opposed to her mother, when they separated in 2006, and\nargued that JV\u2019s choice undermined any claim that she was afraid of defendant. Defense counsel\nfurther cross-examined JV regarding the fact that she claimed that defendant threatened to take\ntheir children if she did not marry him in 2010, but he never took the children, and she was\nactually able to prevent him from seeing them for years. The record does not support a finding\nthat defense counsel\u2019s impeachment efforts and defenses were objectively unreasonable or\nprejudicial.\n\n                               VI. PROSECUTOR\u2019S CONDUCT\n\n        Defendant argues that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct when she impermissibly\ncommented in closing argument that defense counsel used distortions, red herrings, and threw\n\u201cenough stuff at the jury hoping something would stick,\u201d thereby suggesting that defense counsel\nwas attempting to mislead the jury.6 It is generally improper for a prosecutor to argue that\ndefense counsel has attempted to mislead the jury, People v Dalessandro, 165 Mich App 569,\n580; 419 NW2d 609 (1988), but a \u201cprosecutor may fairly respond to an issue raised by the\ndefendant.\u201d People v Brown, 279 Mich App 116, 135; 755 NW2d 664 (2008). Further, an\notherwise improper remark might not warrant reversal if the prosecutor is responding to the\ndefense counsel\u2019s argument. People v Kennebrew, 220 Mich App 601, 608; 560 NW2d 354\n(1996).\n\n\n\n6\n  Because defendant did not so challenge the prosecutor\u2019s comments, these claims are\nunpreserved, and our review is limited to plain error affecting defendant\u2019s substantial rights.\nPeople v Bennett, 290 Mich App 465, 475; 802 NW2d 627 (2010); People v Roscoe, 303 Mich\nApp 633, 648; 846 NW2d 402 (2014).\n\n\n\n                                                -8-\n\f        Viewed in context, the prosecutor\u2019s remarks, made during rebuttal argument, did not\nsuggest that counsel was trying to mislead the jury, but fairly responded to defense counsel\u2019s\nclosing argument by responding, on the basis of the evidence, that the defense\u2019s theory of the\ncase was a pretense and ignored the evidence. In specific, during closing argument, defense\ncounsel argued that the jury should believe defendant and find JV to be \u201ca liar.\u201d Defense counsel\nargued that the prosecutor \u201clikes to pick and choose what testimony she wants you to see or\nhear,\u201d and emphasized that JV had the choice to decide with whom she would live, yet, if JV is\nbelieved, it would mean she chose to live with a \u201crapist.\u201d The prosecutor argued that defense\ncounsel ignored the reasons that JV gave for why she stayed with defendant. The prosecutor also\naddressed defense counsel\u2019s negative assertions regarding the two officers involved in the case.\nDefense counsel suggested that the officer in charge was hiding something because he testified\nabout defendant\u2019s interview, but did not play the videotape of the interview. Counsel further\nemphasized that the defense had to call the initial reporting deputy as a defense witness, and\ncharacterized the deputy as a \u201cprosecution witness.\u201d The prosecutor discussed the evidence that\nsupported her argument that defendant\u2019s story was not believable. The mere use of the\nchallenged language in this context did not make the argument improper.7 The prosecutor was\nnot required to state her inferences in the blandest possible language. People v Dobek, 274 Mich\n58, 66; 732 NW2d 546 (2007). Her remarks were not clearly improper.\n\n                              VII. SCORING OF OV 8 AND OV 13\n\n        Lastly, we reject defendant\u2019s argument that the trial court erroneously scored offense\nvariables (OV) 8 and 13, and, therefore, reject his argument that he is entitled to be resentenced.8\n\n                                              A. OV 8\n\n       MCL 777.38(1)(a) directs a score of 15 points if \u201c[a] victim was asported to another place\nof greater danger or to a situation of greater danger[.]\u201d MCL 777.38(1)(a). Although the term\n\u201casportation\u201d is not defined within the statutory sentencing guidelines, our Supreme Court has\nheld that the \u201casportation\u201d element of OV 8 is satisfied \u201c[i]f a victim was carried away or\n\n\n7\n  Moreover, a timely objection to the challenged remarks could have cured any perceived\nprejudice by obtaining an appropriate cautionary instruction. People v Watson, 245 Mich App\n572, 586; 629 NW2d 411 (2001). And even though defendant did not object, the trial court\ninstructed the jury that the lawyers\u2019 statements and arguments are not evidence, that the jury was\nto decide the case based only on the properly admitted evidence, and that the jury was to follow\nthe court\u2019s instructions. These instructions were sufficient to dispel any possible prejudice and\nto protect defendant\u2019s substantial rights. People v Long, 246 Mich App 582, 588; 633 NW2d\n843 (2001).\n8\n  When reviewing a trial court\u2019s scoring decision, the trial court\u2019s \u201cfactual determinations are\nreviewed for clear error and must be supported by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d People v\nHardy, 494 Mich 430, 438; 835 NW2d 340 (2013). \u201cWhether the facts, as found, are adequate to\nsatisfy the scoring conditions prescribed by statute, i.e., the application of the facts to the law, is\na question of statutory interpretation, which an appellate court reviews de novo.\u201d Id.\n\n\n\n                                                 -9-\n\fremoved to another place of greater danger or to a situation of greater danger[.]\u201d People v\nBarrera, 500 Mich 14, 21; 892 NW2d 789 (2017).\n\n        The trial court concluded that defendant\u2019s asportation of JV was sufficient to score OV 8\nat 15 points because defendant directed her into the bedroom in order to sexually assault her, and\nthe bedroom was \u201cmore secretive.\u201d We agree. JV testified that the sexual assaults occurred in\nthe bedroom. The presentence report (PSIR) also notes that JV described how defendant would\ncall her into the bedroom, away from others, to sexually assault her. 9 Contrary to what defendant\nargues, there is no requirement that the movement be forcible. Therefore, a preponderance of the\nevidence supports that defendant asported JV into the bedroom in order to sexually assault her,\nthus making it less likely that the assault would be discovered, which rendered the location a\n\u201cplace of greater danger\u201d or a \u201csituation of greater danger.\u201d See People v Chelmicki, 305 Mich\nApp 58, 70-71; 850 NW2d 612 (2014).\n\n                                           B. OV 13\n\n        OV 13 \u201cis continuing pattern of criminal behavior.\u201d The trial court must score 50 points\nfor OV 13 if \u201c[t]he offense was part of a pattern of felonious criminal activity involving 3 or\nmore sexual penetrations against a person . . . less than 13 years of age.\u201d MCL 777.43(1)(a). All\ncrimes within a five-year period, including the sentencing offense, must be counted, MCL\n777.43(2)(a), and a pattern of criminal activity may be based on multiple offenses arising from\nthe same event. See People v Harmon, 248 Mich App 522, 532; 640 NW2d 314 (2001). There\nwas ample evidence both at trial and detailed in the PSIR to support that defendant committed\nnumerous and continuous sexual penetrations against JV beginning at age 11. Moreover, as the\ntrial court aptly observed, the evidence used to score OV 13 is not \u201cvenue limited.\u201d\n\n       Affirmed.\n\n\n\n                                                            /s/ Douglas B. Shapiro\n                                                            /s/ Elizabeth L. Gleicher\n                                                            /s/ Colleen A. O'Brien\n\n\n\n\n9\n  \u201cWhen calculating the sentencing guidelines, a court may consider all record evidence,\nincluding the contents of a PSIR . . . .\u201d People v McChester, 310 Mich App 354, 358; 873\nNW2d 646 (2015). It may also properly rely on inferences that arise from the record evidence\nwhen making the findings underlying its scoring of offense variables. People v Earl, 297 Mich\nApp 104, 109; 822 NW2d 271 (2012).\n\n\n\n                                              -10-\n\f"
