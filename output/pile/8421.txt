    "text": "Normally, I would applaud the building of walls; however, recent news from Paris only confirms the dystopian world that we\u2019re all living in.\n\nFrom Politico:\n\nThe Council of Paris unanimously agreed Monday to a proposal to erect a bulletproof wall around the Eiffel Tower in response to the terror threat in France, Le Monde reported. Parisian authorities will put up bulletproof glass on two sides of the tower area, while the two other sides, which serve as entrance and exit points, will be enclosed by metal grids \u201creproducing the profile of the Eiffel Tower.\u201d\n\nCan you imagine?\n\nInstead of confronting the rising crime in our once great cities, Paris has decided to double down on a bulletproof wall, which in practice will only act as another source of anarcho-tyranny to natives. This is part of a greater trend throughout the West which aims to provide preventative actions (think the TSA) and \u201cenhanced\u201d security instead of attacking problems at their root. This is because to ask the question of why the Eiffel tower needs a bullet proof wall is to reveal the contradictions at the heart of the decaying hegemony of liberal discourse in our societies.\n\nInstead, we are told that terror attacks are just part of living in a major city, our \u201cway of life\u201d so to speak.\n\nWe bind ourselves up in a hell and call it heaven because we refuse to imagine any other way of living. Even when it was not so long ago that the idea of a 20 million Euro \u201cbulletproof\u201d wall around the Eiffel tower would be absurd. There is another way.\n\nWe on the Alt-Right imagine a different world from that of the deputy mayor of Paris. We imagine a world where you can roam in our once great cities, stroll along its boulevards, and sit in its cafes without worry \u2014 a world where France is France, and there will always be an England.\n\nIn sum, we imagine a world where we have homes.\n\nWith this latest move, the city of light is embracing the cloud of darkness that threatens to engulf all of our countries. As Donald Trump said, \u201cParis isn\u2019t Paris anymore.\u201d With this latest news, the truth of this statement couldn\u2019t be any clearer."
