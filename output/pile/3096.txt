    "text": "The Senate Commerce Committee held a markup today where Senator John McCain's \n(R-AZ) pipeline safety legislation, S. 2438, was approved.  The overall \noutcome was not unexpected -- the final legislation contained several \nprovisions that went a little bit further than Enron and INGAA would have \nliked, but there was rigorous debate over issues like States' role and \nmandated integrity measures, and close votes on several amendments.  Senator \nMcCain and other bill proponents like Senator Slade Gorton realize those \nissues will need to be addressed before the legislation proceeds to the \nSenate floor.\n\nThe Committee considered several amendments to the legislation:\n\n1)  McCain substitute amendment -- Approved by voice vote.   The amendment \nsubstituted the revised \"Chairman's mark\" text that was developed over the \nlast several days in place of the original version of S. 2438.  All further \namendments at the markup were in the context of this substitute text.\n\n2) McCain amendment to Section 13 (b) (on operator assistance investigations) \n-- Approved by voice vote.  This amendment attempts to fix language in the \nsubstitute text that was problematic to just about everyone in industry and \non the Hill because it unconstitutionally forced an operator to choose \nbetween exercising constitutional rights to protect himself in a criminal \ninvestigation or keeping his job.   The McCain amendment did not seem to \nimprove things much, and many Senators could not understand it.  Senator John \nBreaux (D-LA) objected to it, and asked that the entire section be deleted, \nand there was some good debate on both sides of the issue.   In the end, \nMcCain asked that the amendment be passed with a promise that he would work \nwith Breaux and others to fix it before Senate floor consideration.\n\n3)  Sen. John Kerry (D-MA) Amendment on Enforcement -- Approved by voice \nvote.  Another confusing vote, in which many members did not understand the \nchanges being made, but agreed to it on the condition that clarifications be \nmade before Senate floor action.  Late last night, Enron led a group \nincluding companies from INGAA and AGA in providing comments to Senator Kerry \nwhich caused him to make substantial changes to his amendment before it was \nvoted on at markup, including dropping provisions allowing citizen suits and \nother troubling issues.   In the end, the amendment that passed was \nacceptable to industry.\n\n4)  Sen. Sam Brownback (R-KS) amendment on Advisory Council Pilot Program -- \nRejected 12 to 4.   Brownback's amendment would have replaced the Advisory \nCouncil Pilot Program as proposed in the substitute text with a requirement \nthat already existing technical advisory committees to OPS be required to \nmeet regionally.   There was a good debate on the issue, but Senator Gorton \nmade a strong plea to members that the new Advisory Councils would only be a \npilot program and would not have any binding role.   He also agreed to work \nwith industry on improvements, such as representation of pipelines on the \ncouncils, before Senate floor action.\n\n5)  Brownback amendment on State Role -- Rejected 10 to 9.   This amendment \nwas written by Enron and El Paso, striking language from the bill that was \noverly broad in suggesting that a State had oversight authority over \"other \nactivities\" beyond proper areas like accident investigation, \nconstruction-related activities, and inspection.   There was a heated debate, \nwith Brownback and Breaux making excellent arguments for us, but in the end \nwe were 1 vote short.  In fact 2 Democrats switched their votes at the last \nminute to tip the balance.   I have already had discussions with Senate staff \nafter the markup indicating that this language will need to be fixed to our \nsatisfaction before Senate floor action.\n\n6)  Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) amendment increasing public right-to-know \nrequirements -- Approved by voice vote.   This amendment increases the kinds \nof information that need to be made widely available to the public.    \nBecause of a state of confusion in which many of the Senators left the room \nto go vote on the Senate floor, there was no opposition voiced to the \namendment and it passed without much discussion.\n\n7)  Breaux amendment on Integrity Inspection Program -- Rejected by voice \nvote.  This was another written by Enron and El Paso that would have removed \nthe bias of substitute text language toward internal inspections and pressure \ntesting and broadened the range of tools that a pipeline could include in an \nintegrity management plan.  It also would have removed a requirement that any \nstate and local official would have the chance to comment on the plan and \nreceive a response.   The debate was heated over this amendment, with Senator \nGorton indicating that he could accept the first part of the amendment \n(removing the bias toward internal inspection/pressure testing) but not the \nsecond, which he felt weakened state and local opportunity to comment on \npipleines' integrity plans.   The committee agreed to reject the amendment, \nbut work to fix the second part before Senate floor action.\n\nProcedurally, it was a strange markup session.  A quorum of the Committee (11 \nmembers) needs to be present to vote on final passage of the bill.  A vote on \nthe Senate floor came up as Senator Kerry was explaining his amendment (#3), \nand as Senators were leaving, Senator McCain very quickly asked that the \nentire bill be passed on voice vote before a quorum left the room, subject to \nconsideration of amendments when they returned.   The bill was passed before \nmany knew what was happening.  Of course, only about 7 members came back to \nthe room for the rest of the markup, so much of the voting was done without \nfull everyone's participation, or by proxy -- which had serious effects on \nthe outcome of several amendments.\n\nAs you can see from the notes on many of the amendments, there will be an \nopportunity to fix the legislation before it moves any further.  Several \nSenators indicated after the markup that they had voted with Senator Gorton \non several of the amendments as a courtesy to him, but would not support the \nbill's movement to the Senate floor without serious changes being made.  One \nkey ally is Senator Trent Lott (R-MS), who supported all industry \namendments.  His control of the Senate floor schedule as Senate Majority \nLeader will be key in driving changes to the legislation.   If satisfactory \nchanges are not made, the bill will move no further.\n\nThere will also be an opportunity to provide comments for Committee Report \nlanguage that will accompany the final bill that was passed.  The report will \ngive explanations of several of the concerns that were raised, and provide \nlegislative history that will help clarify areas where there is uncertainty \nabout the real effect of some of the provisions.\n\nWe did have several victories.  Many of the amendments that were expected -- \nworse language from the Administration or Patty Murray legislation -- were \nnot even offered because of the advance work we were able to do with \nRepublican and Democratic Commerce Committee members and staff.   We were \nable to affect a number of changes to the \"Chairman's mark\" or substitute \namendment before the markup even occured.\n\nAnother interesting note:  Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison was a complete \nnon-factor in the markup.  She is the Subcommittee chair responsible for this \nissue, yet she did not make an opening statement and she did not vote at all \non several key amendments of concern to industry.   \n\nWe will be working on the \"where do we go from here\" strategy in the coming \nweeks, and will report as developments occur.  Thanks again to all who helped \nout in preparation for the markup in what was an amazing team effort.  The \ntechnical support of Dave Johnson, Colleen Raker and Lou Soldano was \nextremely valuable.  Phil Lowry's and Dave Johnson's availability to do key \nmeetings with Senators and staff was critical in our efforts.   And Dave and \nI can attest to the fact that Enron was in a leadership role leading up to \nthe markup, guiding the efforts of INGAA and others and directly influencing \nthe direction this legislation will take in the coming weeks and months.\n\nJeff Keeler\n(202) 466-9157"
