But in the long run, it\u2019s politically self-destructive because [candidates] end up talking about the size of government while others are talking about education, healthcare, and serious public concerns. It\u2019s morally empty because, from my tradition and political philosophy, any political movement has to have a vision of social justice and the common good in order to appeal [to people]. And government can play a part in that. I\u2019ve seen over the last five years that it clearly can.\n\nAnd in case you had caught your breath after almost six years of Bush\u2019s foreign policy, here he is on the question \u201cWhich of the president\u2019s speeches do you think best expresses his worldview?\u201d\n\nProbably the second inaugural, which he wanted to be the democracy speech\u2014the culmination of a series of doctrines and approaches that we had defined in the previous two to three years. It talks very frankly about the necessity of democratic transformation for the future of American security. Particularly in the Middle East, the cycle of tyranny and radicalism has produced an unsustainable situation. That dynamic has to be changed, and democracy is the only way to do it. Some of it is working with authoritarian governments that may go down the path of reform, some of it is standing up for dissidents and taking the side of the oppressed, and some of it is confronting outlaw regimes that threaten the international order. This is, in many ways, the clearest crystallization of his foreign policy.\n\nIt\u2019d be comforting to think they\u2019ve learned their lesson, but they clearly haven\u2019t. In case your outrage quotient isn\u2019t yet filled, you can read this interview at Christianity Today. Gerson on the Democratic Party:\n\nI would love to see the Democratic Party return to a tradition of social justice that was found in people like William Jennings Bryan. During that period, many if not most politically engaged evangelicals were in the Democratic Party, because it was a party oriented toward justice.\n\nI don\u2019t see much of that now in the Democratic Party. Instead of an emphasis on the weak and suffering, there\u2019s so much emphasis on autonomy and choice. And so the party of William Jennings Bryan, the party of Franklin Roosevelt, I\u2019m not sure it exists any more. But it would be good if it did.\n\nGerson on Republicans:\n\nThere are some members of the Republican Party who\u2026have a much more narrow view of government\u2019s role. It would be a shame if conservatism were to return to a much more narrow and libertarian and nativist approach.\n\nYour Republican Party, ladies and gentlemen. Bomb-slash-democratize the Arabs, accomplish \u201csocial justice,\u201d cure AIDS in Africa, and ban gay marriage. There\u2019s going to be a lot of work left for the federal government, apparently, even after Bush leaves office."
