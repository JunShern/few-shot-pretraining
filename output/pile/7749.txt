I ordered a cheap $20 multimeter\nfrom Amazon (which was highly rated on EEVblog), which was shipped from China.\nInterestingly, the Chinese seller shipped me a single little worthless plastic\npacket of heat-shrink remote control covers (which somewhat humorously I can\nimagine totally being a thing in Asia, heat-shrink-wrapping all the remotes in\nplastic, sort of like a couch in plastic). This was what the tracking number\npackage was for, and so I _immediately_ hit my bookmark to chat with an Amazon\nrep to report fraud. I went through all the motions, they refunded me the\namount, I left a negative review. But then that night, I got an email from the\nseller saying \"That was your free gift, the multimeter should be there soon\"\nand indeed, the actual multimeter showed up _the next day_ , albeit with\nanother tracking number. The multimeter was definitely shipped from China the\nsame as the garbage package (via epacket, the subsidized, dirt cheap,\nglacially slow shipping method), so the seller had to have shipped the stupid\ngarbage package at around the same time as the actual product I ordered. Other\nreviews mentioned the exact same thing (\"They sent me garbage, but I got the\nthing in another package\").\n\nI've spent time thinking about what kind of fraud they're committing, because\nit doesn't make sense to me why they would send the garbage package with the\ntracking number from my order -- which _screams_ fraud -- but then _also_ send\nme the _actual_ thing I ordered. They're sending two packages to the same\naddress, but it doesn't make sense why, since they're obviously not committing\nthe most straightforward kind of fraud (\"We shipped the item, you can see the\ntracking number\", which incidentally, only works on eBay and not Amazon).\n\n~~~\nggm\nWell.. this story directly provides an answer (potentially) -they get an\nadditional marginal ranking benefit inside some market appraisal score because\nthey double their international successful completion count, for low marginal\ncost of posting negligible weight content to you successfully. The benefit to\nthem is fraud, but not against you: its against the ranking engine inside some\ndigital marketplace like alibaba. You are an unrelated third party who\nvalidates (by accepting) delivery. Since you don't know if the package is\nshrinkwrap \"free gift\" or the $20 meter, you accept. Are you willing to monty-\nhall reject the random package :-)\n\n~~~\npyoung\nSo if I understand this right, they are creating a fake account on some other\nsite (aliexpress, etc...) with his address attached. And then they ship the\n'gift' from the Amazon tracking number, so that he is more likely to accept\nthat package, and then ship the multimeter from the fake account tracking\nnumber, allowing them to leave themselves a positive review on that site.\n\nI always suspected something was going on with the aliexpress ratings. If you\nlook at the reviews it is a lot of one liners like 'i got the item as\ndescribed!' with a 5 star rating.\n\n~~~\nleggomylibro\nThis is the most convoluted thing I've had to think through in awhile.\n\nJeez. Honestly, I mostly ignore reviews on Chinese listing sites unless\nthey're low. It's all about two things:\n\n1\\. Is the price in line with other listings? From both directions?\n\n2\\. How many people have ordered it in the past 90 days?\n\nSometimes that does mean taking a risk with specialty items, or foregoing\nthem. But hey, if it's a critical application I'm not going to source it from\nsketchy international cheap-o listings.\n\n------\ndrawkbox\nI wonder why we have the USPS Chinese subsidy? [1] Seems this makes the\nshipping fraud too easy as it is low cost.\n\n _It was a small epacket -- a special subsidized shipping option that the USPS\noffers Chinese merchants, effectively enabling them to ship a parcel from\nChina to the U.S. for less than it costs to send that same parcel\ndomestically_\n\n _Due to the unbalanced pricing policies of the United Postal Union and\nsubsidies from the U.S. Postal Service, it costs people in China virtually\nnothing to ship small packages to the U.S._\n\n[1] [https://www.forbes.com/sites/wadeshepard/2017/11/05/how-\nthe-...](https://www.forbes.com/sites/wadeshepard/2017/11/05/how-the-usps-\nepacket-gives-postal-subsidies-to-chinese-e-commerce-merchants-to-ship-to-the-\nusa-cheap/)\n\n~~~\npravda\nI think a better solution would be to lower the outrageous prices charged by\nthe USPS to us.\n\nIf you want to send a 1oz 'package' to, for example, France, it will cost\n$13.50. It used to cost closer to $3.40, and then they doubled it overnight to\n$7, and now it is freakishly high.\n\nWhy is this? Because the USPS has a monopoly and is allowed to rob us!\n\n~~~\nScoundreller\nIt a nutshell, that's why I've stopped buying American* and just wait\npatiently for the 4-week free shipping from China.\n\n*I'm Canadian.\n\n~~~\npravda\nAs an American, I can't blame you. I have noticed that the Chinese shipping is\ngetting quicker.\n\nI ordered two of these [1] from China on the 7th. Showed up on the 28th. Only\n3 weeks! ($1.32 for two, shipped)\n\nIf I wanted to send one to Canada, it would cost $2.29 for postage (because is\nit a 'flat', so it is cheaper. If it was bulkier, it would cost $9.50).\n\n[1]\n[https://github.com/jdesbonnet/RCWL-0516](https://github.com/jdesbonnet/RCWL-0516)\n\n~~~\nxellisx\nI've had stuff actually show up in a week from China (Actually my 3D printer -\nFLSun Cube was one of those items). Of course, I've been having stuff show up\nin about 4-6 weeks as of late.\n\n------\nWalterBright\nIt's the free shipping subsidy that's the underlying cause. It's the same\nreason we all receive enormous amounts of email spam (for me it's a couple\nhundred per day) - the cost of sending email is zero.\n\nI bet the email spam problem could be solved at a stroke if senders were\ncharged $.01 per email.\n\n~~~\nAckSyn\nNo. It would be solved if people could run a whitelist that was directly tied\nto your address book, and any address you sent email TO would automatically be\nadded to this address book/whitelist.\n\nI wish mail could operate on a similar method\n\n~~~\nWalterBright\nThunderbird mail does that.\n\n------\ntgsovlerkhgsel\nTitle makes it sound like people are getting shipped drugs and at risk of\ngetting into trouble, not basically empty envelopes.\n\n~~~\nminxomat\nThe mention of empty boxes reminds me of _One Point O_ (2004)...\n\n------\ntheossuary\nI find it funny the article implies this only happens across international\nborders, and would otherwise be policed and stopped if it only happened within\nthe US. I receive unwanted junk mail daily and it isn't even addressed to me,\nbut to 'Current Resident'.\n\nThe real solution is to allow residents to whitelist or blacklist mail. Or\nbetter yet tie mail to people and organizations, not places, and allow people\nto route whatever mail wherever they want.\n\n~~~\nevincarofautumn\nI don\u2019t know if this\u2019d work at all, but I\u2019ve idly considered the possibility\nof starting a grassroots \u201creturn to sender\u201d campaign for junk mail.\n\nAs it is, the postal service is paid to deliver all of that spam\u2014but maybe it\nwould no longer be cost-effective if everyone just said \u201cnope, send it back\u201d\nwhenever possible. As it is, I just recycle all of it, but it still probably\nrepresents a sizable environmental impact in terms of materials, printing,\ndelivery, recycling, and landfills, which we could entirely do away with.\n\n~~~\noasisbob\nWhen I was in college I would do this with all the credit card offers\nreceived, or anything else I found offensive, if it had a return envelope. All\nthe paper they sent would go back in the return envelope, along with a handful\nof pennies, and maybe a guitar string or two taped across the top flap.\n\nI'm sure most of them cost several dollars in postage to get back.\n\n------\ndchichkov\nInteresting. As per Washington Post in 2014 USPS was losing about $1 per every\npackage shipped as ePacket from China. These spam shipments effectively are\nharming USPS.\n\n[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/storyline/wp/2014/09/12/...](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/storyline/wp/2014/09/12/the-\npostal-service-is-losing-millions-a-year-to-help-you-buy-cheap-stuff-from-\nchina/?utm_term=.b5be91c00d80)\n\n~~~\nrahimnathwani\nYou mean 'as per an internal report compiled by USPS, quoted in the Washington\npost'.\n\n~~~\nksk\nWell shouldn't a newspaper standby their reporting?\n\n~~~\nrahimnathwani\nWhen a newspaper prints '{statement}, according to {source}' there's a reason:\nthey don't independently verify those facts. They're printing it in the hope\nthat it's useful, and giving you their source as a cop out or, if you're being\ncharitable, so that you can decide whether you want to believe it or not.\n\nThe statement \"In 2012, USPS was paid only 94 cents on average for each piece\nof Chinese ePacket mail, according to a February report from the Postal\nService\u2019s inspector general\u2019s office.\" is probably 100% accurate, in the same\nsense that \"Rahim is the best dad ever, according to his son\" is true, could\nbe 100% accurate. You could stand by either statement. And both could be\naccurate. But it doesn't mean they're not misleading (in that the fact being\ndiscussed might not be true).\n\nIf you look for it, you'll see similar patterns scattered all over newspapers.\nOne of the most common examples: '{company} reported 4th quarter earnings of\n{amount}'. There's a reason they don't simply say ''{company} earned {amount}\nin Q4'.\n\n------\nared38\nDumb question: Why are the vendors bothering to send anything?\n\n~~~\nnerdponx\nSo Alibaba doesn't figure out that it's fraud, probably.\n\n~~~\ncaptaindiego\nExactly. Often the shipping weight will be measured as it is shipped (likely\nbecause most of these are coming by air). Alibaba and others pass this\nshipping information on to the customer and would likely notice overly low\nshipping weights.\n\nFraudulent sellers will also use a similar method in certain countries where\nthe delivery address is not tracked but weight and delivery status are. They\ncan send a nonsense package to the right country/state, have it appear in\nChina post tracking as delivered, but the fake package was actually went to a\nrandom address with a roughly expected weight. If customers try to file claims\non sites like aliexpress they'll likely rule in the favor of the seller unless\nyou can somehow get your local post office to provide proof it was never\ndelivered to your specific address.\n\n------\nsowbug\nThis must be why I got a flurry of empty envelopes from China a couple months\nago. A+++++ would throw out again.\n\n------\nShivetya\nThe epacket mailing is very common on low cost items you can find on ebay. I\nhave seen it on items costing pennies and actually have won such an auction\nfor less than a dollar and received what was listed. Now apparently the ebay\nbuying has been safe for me and those I know who also have bought epacket\ndelivered items, now they don't come fast but they all have arrived.\n\nso which retailers are they skimming for addresses?\n\n------\ncodewritinfool\nThis is happening to a coworker but the packages are from Amazon. The stuff\ninside is mostly junk.\n\n~~~\nseanmcdirmid\nIf its from amazon in the USA to a USA address, it is illegal and easily\nreported.\n\n~~~\nanonymous5133\nEasily reported but not easily verified.\n\nThere are many cases of people getting shipped drugs and then having the\npolice called on them once the package arrives. It could happen to anyone\nreally. It is also fairly common that people ship drugs to anti-drug\npoliticians.\n\n~~~\nJumpCrisscross\n> _It is also fairly common that people ship drugs to anti-drug politicians_\n\nSource?\n\n------\nJorgeGT\nIt is not only happening in the US, my SO in Spain received these a few months\nago - unsolicited envelopes from China containing a single hair tie each (and\nonce very cheap-looking sunglasses).\n\n------\ncurtisblaine\nWait, can't we do the same? I mean, make money exploiting legal loopholes at\nthe cost of Chinese people and government? After all, the borders work two\nways.\n\n~~~\nsverhagen\nWait, what? Are we upset with China then? So that we want to target innocent\nChinese people? As the article clearly states: it's illegal in China too. Is\ndisrespecting the personal mailing address of a random, innocent Chinese\nperson less valuable than the personal mailing address of a random, innocent\nAmerican? Unless you have personal mailing addresses lying around of the\nspecific people who are brushing the system from China now? But then... while\nthe article talks about stuff being sent _from_ China, I didn't get the idea\nthat it necessarily had to be (exclusively) Chinese people who did it?\n\n~~~\ncurtisblaine\nNo, I was just wondering if these border loopholes were one-way or could be\nplayed from West to East, too.\n\n------\nrandyrand\nI got one of these for the first time about ~1yr ago.\n\n------\nzeep\nat least, they don't use USPS to deliver bio weapons yet...\n\n"
