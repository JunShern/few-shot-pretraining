Here's the page:\nhttps://iiif.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/iiif/image/c444f7e2-ca30-48ae-87b5-54f93d6ed046/full/full/0/default.jpg\n(I got the id for that page from a GUI page)\nI thought I could get the metadata for that page with the /info.json route:\nhttps://iiif.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/iiif/image/c444f7e2-ca30-48ae-87b5-54f93d6ed046/info.json\nBut this doesn't include all pages in the book. Does anyone know how One can obtain all pages from a book using the IIIF spec/API? Any help would be appreciated!\n\nA:\n\nHmm, googling for https://iiif.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/iiif/mirador/c444f7e2-ca30-48ae-87b5-54f93d6ed046 today I saw two results: this post and https://iiif.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/iiif/mirador/c444f7e2-ca30-48ae-87b5-54f93d6ed046. \nThe latter contains all pages in the book, so I suppose the lesson is to search to see if the given IIIF server has a mirador viewer set up, and if so, to ping that...\nAlso, the manifest route contains all links expressed cleanly: https://iiif.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/iiif/manifest/db2fade4-61ee-4a11-a894-19361c551eed.json\n\n"
