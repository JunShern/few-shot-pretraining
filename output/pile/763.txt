I want to insert (at least 5) images in the image column for each product.\n If in future I want to add subcategory for product, what is better either to make separate table of image and then add them to that table or to insert the image with separated commas in image column of same product table. \nHow do I implement it ?

It's a violation of First Normal Form.  It will in the long term cause you a world of pain.  Trust me, I've had enough experience fixing up the mess that inevitably gets left behind by this kind of design to know what a bad idea it is.  \nWhat you should do instead is create a dependant table that has a foreign key back into the primary table.  This is the correct way to represent a 1-n relationship in a RDBMS.  \nHere's some example psuedo-code for creating the tables (NOTE: This is not valid MySQL, just a fairly general SQL-like psudeo-code.  For proper syntax, see the MySQL manual).  \nCREATE TABLE products (\n    SERIAL product_id,\n    // ...\n) PRIMARY KEY product_id;\n\nCREATE TABLE product_images (\n    SERIAL image_id,\n    INT product_id,\n    // ...\n) PRIMARY KEY image_id\nFOREIGN KEY product_id REFERENCES products.product_id\n\nI'll leave inserting and querying these tables as an exercise for the OP, but it should be fairly straightforward.  \nInserting can be done by populating the images product_id field with the ID of the product to which the image belongs.  \nGetting the images is a simple matter of selecting from images based on product ID, or even joining the two tables together on the foreign key.  \n\n"
