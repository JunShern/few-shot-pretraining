    "text": "One of Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2018s sexual harassment accusers penned an open letter today slamming Fox News and accusing multiple higher-ups at the conservative network of engaging in sexual harassment and of covering-up such behavior. And, she warns, they\u2019re soon to be exposed.\n\nIn a post originally published on Facebook the morning of December 16\u2013and now available via Twitter\u2014Juliet Huddy teases an incoming series of accusations and outings for as-yet-unnamed sexual harassers. The letter begins ominously:\n\nTick tock, tick tock. Executives who not only covered up for sexual harassers/predators (<and believe me, I don\u2019t use this word lightly) but WERE THEMSELVES are about to be exposed.\n\nHuddy later accuses Rupert Murdoch of being one such figure\u2013though not a harasser himself. She writes:\n\nRupert Murdoch is not just a media mogul. He\u2019s a perpetrator, complicit in wrecking careers of hardworking, talented people while protecting their tormentors.\n\nLaw&Crime reached out to Huddy for comment on this accusation. She clarified that Murdoch is not being accused of sexual harassment, but rather, she was simply referring to his complicity in \u201ccovering up\u201d the stories about\u2013and claims against\u2013Roger Ailes, Bill O\u2019Reilly and others.\n\nIn a statement, Huddy added:\n\nIt\u2019s ironic that O\u2019Reilly, Murdoch and others have suggested that I, along with the other accusers, are part of some left wing conspiracy. [One], I\u2019m fiscally conservative and socially liberal so let\u2019s just get that out of the way. [And two], based on everything I have seen and has been reported, the participants in this, The Grand Conspiracy, are the executives at Fox.\n\nHuddy\u2019s letter calls out various, unnamed Fox News higher-ups for their sexual harassment and complicity as well. She writes, \u201cThere are still men AND women working at Fox News who actively engaged in sexual harassment and/or subsequent coverup. And they occupy some of, if not THE, highest positions. I know other women were targeted by these people (several of whom are part of my own experience).\u201d\n\nNotably, Huddy\u2019s letter also takes aim at the perceived lack of positive reverberations in the wake of the #metoo watershed. That is, Huddy addresses, at length, how the women who have made the accusations are only seeing half of the justice quotient because while their accused are being punished, many accusers still have to deal with wrecked careers. Huddy notes:\n\nThe women who have already come forward aren\u2019t money-hungry, attention-starved liars or drama queens. And we certainly aren\u2019t part of some left wing conspiracy. Most of us \u2014 not some, but MOST \u2014 can\u2019t get a job in TV because we\u2019re viewed as radioactive. Hire Juliet Huddy? You risk alienating a chunk of your audience that sees her as trying to dismantle Fox News. Or sees her as an unhinged, thrice-divorced man-hater who ruined their evening programming by helping to get Bill O\u2019Reilly fired. It\u2019s the same story for virtually every woman who left Fox and other companies under these circumstances. WE have seen our careers torched, yet WE are not the problem.\n\nHuddy\u2019s letter could be read as a response to recent comments made by Murdoch to Sky News where he rubbished the claims of women who have come forward as \u201cnonsense.\u201d\n\nLaw&Crime reached out to Fox News, Rupert Murdoch and his representatives for comment on this story, but no response was forthcoming at the time of publication.\n\n\n\n[image via screengrab/NBC]\n\nFollow Colin Kalmbacher on Twitter: @colinkalmbacher\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This afternoon, Huddy deleted her original Facebook post citing privacy concerns. This article has been updated to reflect that and incorporate comments from Huddy regarding Rupert Murdoch, Fox News and Bill O\u2019Reilly.\n\nHave a tip we should know? [email protected]"
