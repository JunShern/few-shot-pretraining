    "text": "2.15: Chandler\n\nThrough the rain and increasing darkness of cloud cover, Chandler watched the beast. It was pursuing the soldiers that were retreating. None were attacking the beast outright anymore as Ace must have gotten the retreat order through. Glancing to the left, Chandler saw the portion of the army that had slipped under the wall. They were either incredibly brave or they hadn\u2019t seen the beast.\n\nRunning toward the beast without a second thought, Chandler surprised himself when he heard himself growl. Closing in on the beast, he picked up a shield and flung it. Not waiting to see the shield made contact, he picked up a spear and threw that as well.\n\nThe beast looked up and dropped an armless soldier. Its eyes were a piercing red that sent a shiver down Chandler\u2019s spine, despite the heat of the day. Without a warning, it charged.\n\nChandler whirled around and sprinted for the oncoming traffic of hole-emerging Lurians. He ran passed them and a few of them shouted, confused. Until the beast came into view and slammed soldier after soldier into the stone wall, still pursuing Chandler. He heard the cracking of bones against the wall as he glanced over his shoulder. Chandler had just turned to look forward when a sword lunged for his head. In an utter panic, Chandler upper body fell back while he legs continued forward. The blade missed by a hair. Chandler landed on the ground with a squelching sound as the ground sucked him down. He did not expect to still be alive. His reactions had never been that effective.\n\nSplashing into the muddy soil, Chandler stumbled to his feet as quickly as possible, looking to stay ahead of the red-eyed beast. Another sword swipe never came as that soldier became yet another crunch against the wall.\n\nStill running, Chandler frantically searched for the hole in the wall as red-eyes gained on him. Its attention was still zeroed in on the boy. How could he lose it? Chandler turned as he reached the end of the line of soldiers as it now turned to go out through the wall. If he ran any further he\u2019d have no soldiers to distract the beast with.\n\nChandler stood, flexing his fingers as the beast rampaged through the Lurians, finally stopping briefly before the boy. Hopping forward, it swung a large army at his and he once again dove out of the way, landing it the mud. Chandler managed to get his head up as the beast approached. At least he had saved some of the retreating Ikalgans. He plopped his head back into the accepting mud and let the rain pour over his unresponsive body.\n\n\u201cHey!\u201d a voice shouted from near the entry through the wall. \u201cWe can\u2019t leave him!\u201d\n\nOne Lurian soldier broke formation and cautiously approached the beast. He turned and yelled to the men again, \u201cCome on!\u201d Three more soldiers joined him as they surrounded the beast. It ignored them, almost upon Chandler now. The man who yelled earlier charged the beast. The muddy boy willed the man to reach the beast in time before it\u2019s red-eyes were the last thing Chandler saw.\n\nThe creature raised its arms before a sword went into its back. Red-eyes growled in a low tone before swiping at its attacker. Chandler\u2019s savior was thrown several feet and lay unmoving in a puddle. The other three closed in and rushed the beast. It crushed one attacker beneath its four arms and twirled, looking around wildly as a sword plunged into its neck.\n\nChandler watched as the battle continued on. Now two soldiers facing off against the beast, its head creepily hanging on by a thread.\n\nBehind the beast, the rest of the Lurian army retreated, likely not wanting to see if Ikalgans had more than one of these beasts.\n\nRed-eyes charged one of the last two remaining soldiers. The man stood his ground and tried to sidestep the beast at the last moment. He successfully severed the beast\u2019s head but was caught under the creature as it fell dying. The last soldier glanced around and upon seeing he was the last remaining one, took off through the hole without hesitation.\n\nChandler laid there for what seemed like an eternity before he attempted to rise. He successfully got to one knee before collapsing face first into the mud. It was in that position that Chandler waited to be found, conscious and exhausted with a face full of mud.\n\nWhat Is This?\n\nThe Eternity Acts is a serial web-novel that focuses on the aftermath of the Acts of King Rayon. All works on this WordPress will take place in this universe. The main story will keep to a Wednesday and Saturday posting schedule. I will also post short stories which will be one-offs of various people from the universe.\n\nThe Whisperer Rayon cursed his villagers, summoned a Wall of Fire and created a Burning Sea to mold his kingdom into a place he deemed worth living in.\n\n150 years later and the Whisperer Rayon is gone, but his acts remain. Will the villagers, whose curse changes them by night, be able to overcome the acts of this twisted madman to create a society free from his acts? It may take centuries, but a new King, an ex-slave, and the last Whisperer will certainly try..."
