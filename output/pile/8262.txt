If removing a file fixes it then you know the issue is related to that file. You can then run a diff with your version and the updated core version to hopefully see what you need to include.\nIt may help to go through the release notes for each release and check what changes have been made to related/upsell/crosssells, for example in 2.2.2 these changes were made:\n\nA price change to a custom option affects only that option. Previously, changing the price of a custom option also affected the price of related products. GitHub-4588, GitHub-5798, GitHub-6041, GitHub-6097\n\nAnd\n\nMagento now successfully loads re-ordered related products when Edge-Mode is activated.\n\nIf removing all your changes fails then I wish you extra good luck.\nHope this helps.\n\n"
