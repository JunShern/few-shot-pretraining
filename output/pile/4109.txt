AD affects 27 million people world-wide with steadily increasing numbers, thereby raising significant economic problems and tremendous personal suffer [@pone.0041457-Brookmeyer1]. The two pathological hallmarks that characterize AD are the presence of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and extracellular neuritic plaques that can be found *post mortem* in the brains of patients [@pone.0041457-Braak1], [@pone.0041457-Braak2], [@pone.0041457-Selkoe1]. Neurofibrillary tangles consist of twisted filaments of hyperphosphorylated tau protein [@pone.0041457-Duff1], whereas plaques are primarily composed of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) [@pone.0041457-Selkoe1], [@pone.0041457-Dickson1], a 39--43 amino acid (aa) peptide derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by proteolytic processing [@pone.0041457-Selkoe1], [@pone.0041457-Vetrivel1]. According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis (16), A\u03b2 peptides and, more specifically, their aggregated forms initiate cellular events leading to the pathologic effects of AD [@pone.0041457-Haass1], [@pone.0041457-Hardy1].\n\n*Pre mortem,* AD is usually diagnosed after the appearance of symptoms by application of tests for cognitive impairment like the mini-mental status examination (MMSE) or the Alzheimer's disease assessment scale (ADAS) [@pone.0041457-Folstein1], [@pone.0041457-Mohs1]. However, it is a great challenge to correctly diagnose AD at early presymptomatic stages [@pone.0041457-Ganguli1], [@pone.0041457-Knopman1], [@pone.0041457-Visser1]. Several publications support the finding that plaques start to accumulate 10 to 20 years before clinical symptoms appear, leading to substantial and progressive neuronal loss [@pone.0041457-Braak2], [@pone.0041457-Mintun1], [@pone.0041457-Price1]. Therefore, detection and quantitation of amyloid species in the brains of patients during the course of the disease for early diagnosis of AD and for monitoring AD-treatments is a promising and emerging field in AD research. An efficient tool for presymptomatic characterization of the brain may be imaging approaches making use of amyloid specific ligands and positron emission tomography (PET) [@pone.0041457-Silverman1] or single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Currently, only a few amyloid PET ligands have been applied in clinical studies (for review, see ref. [@pone.0041457-Nordberg1], [@pone.0041457-Nordberg2]). Numerous efforts are devoted to develop new, target-specific imaging agents for the detection of amyloid plaques *in vivo*. To be suitable, they should provide highly specific binding to A\u03b2 aggregates, very selective labeling and efficient brain penetration. Moreover, imaging probes are desired with specificity for A\u03b21--42 over other A\u03b2 isoforms.\n\nThe present study used a small, specific A\u03b21--42 binding peptide comprising solely of D-enantiomeric amino acids, termed \"D1\" [@pone.0041457-vanGroen1], [@pone.0041457-Wiesehan1], [@pone.0041457-Wiesehan2], or alternatively, ACI-80 [@pone.0041457-JahanM1], [@pone.0041457-GulysB1]. ACI-80 was identified employing a mirror image phage display selection using aggregated A\u03b21--42 as a target. *In vitro*, ACI-80 binds preferentially to aggregated A\u03b21--42 with a K~D~ in the submicromolar range, whereas monomers are bound to a much less extent. In brain tissue sections derived from patients that suffered from AD, amyloid plaques and leptomeningeal vessels containing A\u03b2 aggregates were stained specifically with a fluorescence-labeled derivative of ACI-80. Fibrillar deposits derived from other amyloidosis were not labeled by ACI-80 [@pone.0041457-Wiesehan1], [@pone.0041457-Wiesehan2], [@pone.0041457-Bartnik1]. We also demonstrated *in vivo* and *in vitro* that ACI-80 binds specifically to aggregated A\u03b21--42 in the brains of APP/PS1 transgenic mice, where diffuse amyloid-\u03b2 deposits, which do not contain A\u03b21--42, were not stained [@pone.0041457-vanGroen1].\n\n10.1371/journal.pone.0041457.t001\n\n###### Pyroglutamate content of ACI-80, ACI-80-K\u03d5 and \\[^127^I\\]-ACI-80.\n\n![](pone.0041457.t001){#pone-0041457-t001-1}\n\n                                                      ACI-80~solid~   ACI-80-K\u03d5~solid~   \\[^127^I\\]-ACI-80~aqueous\\ solution~\n  -------------------------------------------------- --------------- ------------------ --------------------------------------\n  Identified amino acid at the N-terminal position                                      \n  glutamine                                              \\>91.2%          \\>94.4%                       62.6%\n  pyroglutamate                                          \\<8.8%            \\<5.6%                       37.4%\n  Molecular weight                                       1421 Da          1907 Da                      1548 Da\n\nK\u03d5 presents a lysine (K) linked to a fluorescein isothiocyanate (\u03d5).\n\nHere, we investigate the properties of several derivatives of ACI-80.

Briefly, to an aqueous solution of peptide, borate buffer (0.5 M, pH 8.61) was added and the color of the solution changed from yellow to dark orange. Slightly excess amount of \\[^19^F\\]-*N*-succinimidyl\u22124-fluorobenzoate (SFB) in acetonitrile was added into this above solution and the reaction mixture was kept at RT for 10 min. The reaction was monitored by HPLC. The crude product was purified by an analytical HPLC column (3\u00d7300 mm, 10 \u00b5m, waters) using water with 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and an acetonitrile (MeCN) gradient (20% to 50%, v/v) as eluent with a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Retention time of the three reference peptides were from 9 to 12 min at a wavelength at 234 nm. Then the product fraction was collected into a pre-filled slightly basic aqueous solution (40 ml, pH was adjusted by NaOH). This diluted fraction was passed through a C18 Sep-Pak plus cartridge (preconditioned with 10 ml ethanol +10 ml water) and the desired product was eluted with 1 ml of ethanol. The reference compounds were confirmed by LC-MS/MS. The purity and the stability of the products were checked by HPLC.\n\n10.1371/journal.pone.0041457.t003\n\n###### Results of the binding assays for ACI-80-K\u03d5 derivatives to A\u03b21--42 fibrils using surface plasmon resonance.\n\n![](pone.0041457.t003){#pone-0041457-t003-3}\n\n  Derivative/Modification           Name                  Interaction \\[%\\]           Dissociation \\[%\\]\n  ------------------------- --------------------- ---------------------------------- --------------------\n  D1-K\u03d5                           ACI-80-K\u03d5        used as standard and set to 100%  \n  D1-V12K-K\u03d5                      ACI-87-K\u03d5                      324                         443\n  D1-V12K-K\\[^19^F\\]\u03d5        \\[^19^F\\]-ACI-87-K\u03d5                 153                          67\n  **D1-Q1P**                     **ACI-83**                                          \n  D1-Q1P-K\u03d5                       ACI-83-K\u03d5                      600                         200\n  D1-Q1P-V12K-K\u03d5                  ACI-89-K\u03d5                      518                         533\n  D1-Q1P-V12K-K\\[^19^F\\]\u03d5    \\[^19^F\\]-ACI-89-K\u03d5                 476                          0\n  D1-Q1P-H3F-K\u03d5                   ACI-86-K\u03d5                       21                          40\n  **D1-Q1X**                     **ACI-82**                                          \n  D1-Q1X-K\u03d5                       ACI-82-K\u03d5                      393                         300\n  D1-Q1X-V12K-K\u03d5                  ACI-88-K\u03d5                      365                         667\n  D1-Q1X-V12K-K\\[^19^F\\]\u03d5    \\[^19^F\\]-ACI-88-K\u03d5                 294                         1233\n  D1-Q1X-H3F-K\u03d5                   ACI-85-K\u03d5                      229                          40\n  **D1-Q1Z**                     **ACI-81**                                          \n  D1-Q1Z-K\u03d5                       ACI-81-K\u03d5                      129                          40\n  D1-Q1Z-H3F-K\u03d5                   ACI-84-K\u03d5                       93                          40\n\nInteraction and dissociation was measured with respect to the maximal interaction signal during injection and the response 60 s after the end of injection, respectively.

The mice were anesthetized and transcardially perfused with saline. The brains were removed and snap frozen. 10 \u00b5m thick sagittal cryostat sections through the whole mouse brain were produced and mounted onto glass slides. \u03d5-labeled compounds were applied to investigate binding. Thus, the slides were thawed, washed in PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (20 min at RT) just before incubation with \u03d5-labeled compounds. One series of sections was treated only with fluorescent compounds (0.01 mg/ml, incubation time 2 h) while another series of sections were incubated with anti-A\u03b2 antibody 6E10 at 1\u2236500 dilution (SIG-39320, Covance; final antibody concentration was 2 \u00b5g/ml) in addition to \u03d5-labeled compounds (0.01 mg/ml). The slices were washed in PBS.

It is known that peptides with an N-terminal glutamine are prone to conversion of this residue into a pyroglutamate [@pone.0041457-Abraham1]. Therefore, the composition of freshly synthesized and untreated ACI-80 and ACI-80-K\u03d5 as well as \\[^127^I\\]-ACI-80 after iodination were investigated. The results are displayed in [Table 1](#pone-0041457-t001){ref-type=\"table\"}. It was observed that freshly synthesized ACI-80 and ACI-80-K\u03d5 contained only minor fractions of pyroglutamic acid while about one third of \\[^127^I\\]-ACI-80 in solution already converted into N-terminal pyroglutamate species.\n\nThus, a number of novel ACI-80-derivatives were designed and synthesized with one or several amino acid deletions and/or substitutions with the aim to increase compound stability, but also A\u03b2 binding capability. Specifically, the N-terminal glutamine was either substituted by pyroglutamate (Q1Z) or proline (Q1P) or deleted (Q1X). Furthermore, a replacement of His-3 by phenylalanine (H3F) was investigated. The Q1X deletion as well as Q1P and H3F substitutions have been proposed based on semiquantitative saturation mutagenesis peptide spot data, which predicted that the mutations would enhance A\u03b2 binding. In the peptide spot approach, all amino-acids of ACI-80 were substituted against all other natural amino acids and the variants were tested for their ability to bind A\u03b2 fibrils (data not shown). In addition valine was replaced by lysine at position 12 (V12K) to enable fluorination of the compound for imaging purposes. Finally, the compound was also fluorescein isothiocyanate (\u03d5)-labeled via an additional C-terminal lysine residue to enable detection through fluorescence or via anti-fluorescein isothiocyanate antibodies. For a summary of all ACI-80 derivatives see [Table 2](#pone-0041457-t002){ref-type=\"table\"}.\n\nSurface Plasmon Resonance and ELISA {#s3b}\n-----------------------------------\n\nTo characterize the ACI-80 derivatives in respect to their A\u03b2 binding capabilities in comparison to ACI-80-K\u03d5, a number of *in vitro* assays were performed.\n\nSurface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays were performed to analyze their interaction with immobilized A\u03b21--42 fibrils ([Table 3](#pone-0041457-t003){ref-type=\"table\"}). A\u03b21--42 fibrils were immobilized on a Biacore sensor-chip as described in the methods section, and the interactions of the \u03d5-labeled ACI-80 derivatives were measured and compared with original ACI-80-K\u03d5. Due to the fact that A\u03b21--42 fibrils represent an inhomogeneous mixture of different fibril aggregates, it is hardly possible to form a homogenous A\u03b21--42 loaded SPR chip surface. Therefore we decided for semi-quantitative comparison between all compounds only. The maximal responses in resonance units (RU) of the \u03d5-labeled ACI-80 derivatives during the analyte injection and the remaining response 60 s after injection end (as a semi-quantitative measure for the dissociation rate), have been related to the respective values obtained from identical concentrations of ACI-80-K\u03d5 in percent. The results are summarized in [Table 3](#pone-0041457-t003){ref-type=\"table\"} and [Figure 1](#pone-0041457-g001){ref-type=\"fig\"}.\n\nACI-80-K\u03d5 derivatives ACI-82-K\u03d5 and ACI 83-K\u03d5 (aa modifications Q1X and Q1P) yielded an increased response of up to 600% as compared to ACI-80-K\u03d5 ([Table 3](#pone-0041457-t003){ref-type=\"table\"}). The response for ACI-81-K\u03d5 (aa substitution Q1Z) was not significantly increased. The substitution at the third amino acid position (H3F) did not lead to improved binding to A\u03b2. While ACI-84-K\u03d5 behaved slightly worse than ACI-81-K\u03d5, the binding efficiencies of ACI-85-K\u03d5 and ACI-86-K\u03d5 were drastically reduced as compared with those of ACI-82-K\u03d5 and ACI-83-K\u03d5, respectively. The single substitution at aa position 12, valine to lysine (ACI-87-K\u03d5), resulted in a response increase to more than 300%. Compounds ACI-88-K\u03d5 and ACI-89-K\u03d5 with two substitutions, the first one at amino acid position 1 (Q1X, Q1P) and the second one at amino acid position 12 (V12K), yielded a response increase to 350% (Q1X-V12K) and more than 500% (Q1P-V12K). The substitution V12K had an important impact with respect to dissociation. All three compounds with a V12K substitution showed decreased dissociation rates (increased remaining response 60 s after injection end) as compared to the compounds without the V12K substitution. Therefore, ACI-87-K\u03d5, ACI-88-K\u03d5, and ACI-89-K\u03d5 were the most promising compounds for further studies. In order to investigate, whether \\[^18^F\\]-labeling will change their binding affinities, the respective \\[^19^F\\]-labeled compounds have been investigated as well. Except for \\[^19^F\\]-ACI-87-K\u03d5 (Q1X-V12K), which showed a decreased response in comparison to the compound without label, the \\[^19^F\\]-labeled compounds showed virtually the same behavior with respect to maximum binding. The remaining response 60 s after injection end, however, was significantly changed in all three cases. Based on the remaining response 60 s after injection end, \\[^19^F\\]-ACI-88-K\u03d5 exerted the slowest off-rate of all tested compounds indicating the most suitable binding behavior for being used as a molecular probe.\n\nTo verify the SPR results, ELISA was employed to assay the interaction of the ACI-80 derivatives ACI-80-K\u03d5, ACI-81-K\u03d5, ACI-82-K\u03d5, ACI-83-K\u03d5, ACI-84-K\u03d5, ACI-85-K\u03d5, ACI-86-K\u03d5, ACI-87-K\u03d5, \\[^19^F\\]-ACI-87-K\u03d5, ACI-88-K\u03d5, \\[^19^F\\]-ACI-88-K\u03d5, ACI-89-K\u03d5, \\[^19^F\\]-ACI-89-K\u03d5) with A\u03b21--42 fibrils and A\u03b2 peptide film in solution containing mostly monomers and smaller oligomers ([Table 4](#pone-0041457-t004){ref-type=\"table\"}). To avoid any bias by possible conformational influences the ELISA has been carried out in two versions, once with immobilized antibody and once with immobilized A\u03b21--42 as described in the methods section. Both assays yielded similar results and confirmed each other. All experiments were performed twice and showed reproducible results. Panels A and B in [Figure 2](#pone-0041457-g002){ref-type=\"fig\"} show the results for binding to A\u03b21--42 fibrils and panels C and D in [Figure 2](#pone-0041457-g002){ref-type=\"fig\"} show the results for binding to freshly prepared A\u03b21--42 peptide film, which contains mostly monomeric A\u03b2. In [Table 4](#pone-0041457-t004){ref-type=\"table\"}, the performance of the peptides is expressed relative to that of ACI-80-K\u03d5.\n\nBriefly summarized, the binding of the ACI-80 derivatives to A\u03b21--42 fibrils was generally stronger than that to monomer-enriched freshly prepared A\u03b21--42. In addition, for both A\u03b2 species a similar order of binding strengths could be established. All variants, except ACI-81-K\u03d5 and ACI-84-K\u03d5, showed stronger A\u03b2 binding than ACI-80-K\u03d5. Substitution of glutamine to proline at position 1 or glutamine deletion had a positive effect on binding to A\u03b21--42. Inversely, binding to A\u03b21--42 was reduced for ACI-84-K\u03d5 as compared to ACI-80-K\u03d5. ACI-81-K\u03d5 and ACI-84-K\u03d5 are peptides with glutamine to pyroglutamate substitution. Thus, the substitution of glutamine to pyroglutamate decreased binding to A\u03b21--42. An order of binding comparing fluorinated with respect to non-fluorinated D-peptides versions was difficult to establish. The results clearly show that the fluorinated \u03d5-labeled peptides \\[^19^F\\]-ACI-87-K\u03d5, \\[^19^F\\]-ACI-88-K\u03d5, \\[^19^F\\]-ACI-89-K\u03d5 bound well to A\u03b21--42 fibrils, \\[^19^F\\]-ACI-88-K\u03d5, \\[^19^F\\]-ACI-89-K\u03d5 being even among the very best of all variants. The order of binding strengths for the fluorinated peptides was \\[^19^F\\]-ACI-89-K\u03d5 binds stronger than \\[^19^F\\]-ACI-88-K\u03d5 much stronger than \\[^19^F\\]-ACI-87-K\u03d5. These peptides with \\[^19^F\\] replaced by \\[^18^F\\] were used in autoradiography assays for testing the binding to human Alzheimer's brain tissue sections [@pone.0041457-GulysB1]. Briefly, the experiments, using *post mortem* human brain autoradiography in whole hemisphere human brains obtained from deceased AD patients and age matched control subjects, support the visualization capacity of the radiolabeled ACI-80 analogues of amyloid deposits in the human brain [@pone.0041457-GulysB1].\n\nIn general, the ELISA results corresponded well with the SPR results identifying the substitution of glutamine to proline or glutamine deletion at the N-terminus as useful mutation with strong benefits for the binding to A\u03b2 fibrils and monomers.\n\nAs the compounds ACI-87-K\u03d5, ACI-88-K\u03d5, ACI-89-K\u03d5 were the most promising candidates for further development, we tried to obtain more quantitative binding data and compared them to ACI-80-K\u03d5. Different concentrations of the analytes were applied to an SPR chip loaded with A\u03b2 fibrils ([Fig. 3](#pone-0041457-g003){ref-type=\"fig\"}). A brief look at the data already revealed that about a five-fold concentrations of ACI-87-K\u03d5 and ACI-80-K\u03d5 were necessary to obtain comparable RU responses as compared to ACI-88-K\u03d5 and ACI-89-K\u03d5. All three ACI-80 derivatives showed tighter binding to fibrils as compared to ACI-80-K\u03d5. As already mentioned above, any effort to obtain an exact quantitative analysis of experimental data from SPR experiments with A\u03b2 fibrils is prone to mis- and over-interpretation. We found, however, that the heterogeneous ligand binding model (see methods section for details) was able to yield potentially meaningful results for all four compounds without introducing too many fit parameters. With all necessary caution and taking into account only the lowest *K* ~D~ value of the two obtained from the heterogeneous binding model, the fitted *K* ~D~ values given in [Table 5](#pone-0041457-t005){ref-type=\"table\"} confirm the order of binding: with an obtained dissociation constant in the submicromolar range ACI-88-K\u03d5 binds stronger than ACI-89-K\u03d5 and ACI-87-K\u03d5, and all three of them bind stronger than ACI-80-K\u03d5.\n\nEx vivo Staining of Mouse Brain Slices by FITC Labeled Compounds {#s3c}\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBrain sections from transgenic (tg) APP (London mutation V717l) x PS1 (A246E) mice were stained using ACI-80-K\u03d5, ACI-87-K\u03d5, ACI-88-K\u03d5, ACI-89-K\u03d5. Also, anti-A\u03b2 plaque staining (using the 6E10 antibody) and DAPI nuclei counterstaining was performed on the same slides. Photomicrographs of the stained slices and triple overlay images are shown in [Figure 4](#pone-0041457-g004){ref-type=\"fig\"}.\n\nA\u03b2 plaques were identified in all tg animals using 6E10 anti-A\u03b2 antibody. Moreover, plaques were stained by all tested compounds, although to different extent and with different intensity and background. Specifically, ACI-89-K\u03d5 and ACI-88-K\u03d5 stained plaques most intensively, whereas ACI-88-K\u03d5 additionally yielded the lowest background signal of all peptides. As shown in [Figure 4](#pone-0041457-g004){ref-type=\"fig\"}, ACI-89-K\u03d5 and ACI-88-K\u03d5 match 6E10 anti-A\u03b2 staining quite well giving rise to a large extent of overlay in the triple exposure.\n\nFor the peptide ACI-87-K\u03d5, nearly no overlay with 6E10 anti-A\u03b2 was detected by means that only a very small fraction of the plaques identified with anti-A\u03b2 antibody 6E10 have been stained with the D-peptide. The detection of overlay by the eye is additionally hindered by high background fluorescence. Moreover, ACI-89-K\u03d5 and ACI-88-K\u03d5 showed a slightly different staining pattern by means that ACI-88-K\u03d5 stained the core of plaques while ACI-89-K\u03d5 has a staining pattern which is more similar to the one of 6E10 which also stains diffuse A\u03b2 plaques.\n\nTherefore, the qualitative assessment demonstrates that the peptides are able to recognize plaques in tg mouse brains with different intensities and background signals. Overall, \\[^19^F\\]-ACI-89-K\u03d5 and ACI-88-K\u03d5 showed a good overlap with 6E10 A\u03b2 staining and have thus confirmed their leading roles as candidates for further evaluation.\n\nTo further proof with a fluorescent independent read-out that ACI-89-K\u03d5 binds to plaques after peripheral injection, an antibody recognizing the FITC group in ACI-89-K\u03d5 was used ([Figure 5](#pone-0041457-g005){ref-type=\"fig\"}). This antibody binds to \u03d5-labeled peptides that are bound to A\u03b2 plaques in \u03d5-peptide immersed tg mouse brain slices. The alkaline phosphatase reaction showed abundant chromogenic deposits resembling the expected distribution and number of A\u03b2 plaques in these brains identified by ACI-89-K\u03d5. Thus confidence was provided that ACI-89-K\u03d5 binds to brain A\u03b2 plaques following peripheral application.\n\nDiscussion {#s4}\n==========\n\nOne of the hallmarks of AD is A\u03b2 accumulation in plaques, probably long time before manifestation of clinical symptoms. Here, we have characterized novel ligands that we believe can have the potential to be used for diagnostic imaging in patients with AD and also in individuals that score as MCI. There is strong demand for imaging probes that allow early diagnosis of the disease, thus enabling novel therapies that allow early intervention. Also such probes will be important to monitor disease progression and therapy success in longitudinal studies. The ligands also have the potential to be used for PET imaging, for example in transgenic mouse models, that overexpress the amyloid precursor proteins and develop amyloid plaques, or in aged monkeys. Imaging of parenchymal A\u03b2 plaques, which mainly consist of the isoform A\u03b21--42 in both, transgenic animals and humans, heavily relies on molecular probes that are specifically binding to A\u03b21--42 fibrils. In order to discriminate between the two most relevant A\u03b2 depositions in AD, namely vascular A\u03b2, which mainly consists of A\u03b21--40, and parenchymal A\u03b2, which mainly contains A\u03b21--42, there is an urgent need for such a specific PET ligand, as it is not clear if the currently most advanced \\[^11^C\\]-PIB-PET compound discriminates between A\u03b21--40 and 1--42 *in vivo* [@pone.0041457-Svedberg1].\n\nThe lead compounds ACI-87-K\u03d5, ACI-88-K\u03d5 and ACI-89-K\u03d5 of this program were derived from ACI-80, which is a D-enantiomeric, 12 amino acid peptide that originally was selected by mirror-image phage display (24). D-peptides have several advantages over L-enantiomeric peptides. Most importantly, they are resistant to most proteases [@pone.0041457-Milton1], which can dramatically increase serum [@pone.0041457-Sadowski1] and saliva [@pone.0041457-Wei1] half-life.\n\nThe need for exploring derivatives of ACI-80 was dictated by the observation that the N-terminal amino acid residue of ACI-80 converted from glutamine to pyroglutamate in aqueous solution. In addition, ACI-80 derivatives with increased binding affinity to aggregated A\u03b2 species were desirable. The lead compounds ACI-87-K\u03d5, ACI-88-K\u03d5 and ACI-89-K\u03d5 were stable in aqueous solution and showed even superior A\u03b2 binding characteristics as compared to ACI-80-K\u03d5. This was confirmed by ELISA and SPR *in vitro* binding assays. The ELISA results were fully compatible with the results from SPR. In general, a stronger binding of ACI-80-K\u03d5 and its derivatives to aggregated A\u03b2 forms, in comparison to monomeric forms, could be verified by ELISA. This is in accordance to the observation previously reported for ACI-80 [@pone.0041457-Bartnik1]. Whether the ACI-80 derivatives also inherited the ACI-80 property to preferentially bind A\u03b21--42 over A\u03b21--40, was not investigated in the present study.\n\nAll *in vitro* binding data agree that Q1X and Q1P mutations lead to an increase of binding and a decrease of dissociation rate, whereas the H3F mutation led to a decrease in binding. In line with the SPR results, the ELISA data confirmed that the substitution of glutamine to proline and the glutamine deletion increased binding to A\u03b21--42 whereas the substitution of glutamine to pyroglutamate decreased binding to A\u03b2. Also, fluorinated, \u03d5-labeled D-compounds bound well to A\u03b2 fibrils.\n\nThe SPR measurements that were carried out to compare the binding capabilities of ACI-80-K\u03d5, ACI-87-K\u03d5, ACI-88-K\u03d5 and ACI-89-K\u03d5 to A\u03b2-fibrils once more confirmed the binding order: ACI-88-K\u03d5 binds stronger than ACI-89-K\u03d5 stronger than ACI-87-K\u03d5 much stronger than ACI-80-K\u03d5. Although not all of the fitted binding curves do perfectly fit to the experimental data, the applied evaluation procedure yielded some values for binding affinities that allowed comparison between the four compounds.\n\n*Ex vivo* staining of transgenic mouse brains showed that the FITC labeled compounds ACI-87-K\u03d5, ACI-88-K\u03d5 and ACI-89-K\u03d5 and their fluorinated derivatives \\[^19^F\\]-ACI-87-K\u03d5, \\[^19^F\\]-ACI-88-K\u03d5, and \\[^19^F\\]-ACI-89-K\u03d5 readily recognized amyloid plaques in the mouse brain sections. This is important evidence that these compounds can be used to monitor therapy progress in AD mouse models. Interestingly, \\[^19^F\\]-ACI-89-K\u03d5 showed a different staining pattern in comparison to the other compounds, being more diffuse and comparable to the staining of 6E10 A\u03b2 antibody.\n\nAs already described in two other reports [@pone.0041457-JahanM1], [@pone.0041457-GulysB1] positive autoradiography (ARG) signals, compatible with A\u03b2 staining, have been found in cortical gray matter using \\[^18^F\\]-ACI-87-K\u03d5, \\[^18^F\\]-ACI-88-K\u03d5, \\[^18^F\\]-ACI-89-K\u03d5, \\[^125^I\\]-ACI-80 and \\[^125^I\\]-ACI-80-K\u03d5 ARG on human whole hemisphere brain sections of patients with AD. Brain sections from non-Alzheimer's control subjects were significantly less stained in the cortical gray matter, underpinning the specificity of the ARG signal.\n\nIn conclusion, especially the ACI-80 derivatives ACI-87-K\u03d5, ACI-88-K\u03d5 and ACI-89-K\u03d5 show superior binding affinities and specificities suggesting them as potential probes for specific A\u03b2 aggregate and plaque detection in the living brain.\n\n**Competing Interests:**K.P. is employee of AC Immune.
