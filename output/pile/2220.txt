Exception class EHelpSystemException with message 'No context-sensitive help installed'.\n\nThe helpfile property of the form is set to exename.hlp.\nManually double-clicking on the .hlp file in explorer opens the hlp file just fine.  \nHow do I get Delphi to open the hlp file when called upon?\n\nA:\n\nYou must include the Vcl.WinHelpViewer unit in your project for the WinHelp system to be installed. \nBe warned that WinHelp support ended at XP and on later versions the WinHelp component must be installed separately. \n\n"
