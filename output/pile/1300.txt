Currently there are eight different majors: Theatre, Musical Theatre, Technical Theatre, Vocal Music, Instrumental Music, Dance, Creative Writing, and Visual Arts. The Literary Arts program was added at the start of the 2011-2012 school year. The school building is located adjacent to the Maryland Theatre in the arts and entertainment district of downtown Hagerstown, Washington County, Maryland, United States.
