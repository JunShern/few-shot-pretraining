Many candidates may appear promising on paper, but you can only choose one for the job. Inviting dozens of people into your office for a job interview simply isn\u2019t realistic, as it would take a huge amount of time.\n\nMany companies combat this issue by conducting phone interviews for initial candidate screenings. This is a quick and easy way to eliminate those who aren\u2019t right for the job, so you can focus all of your attention on the top contenders.\n\n5 Tips to Conduct an Effective Phone Interview\n\nFeeling a bit unsure about how to conduct a phone interview? Use the following five tips to get started:\n\nBe Prepared. Take the time to thoroughly review the candidate\u2019s resume prior to the interview, so you\u2019re able to ask specific questions about their skills and experience. You\u2019ll need as much detail as you can get to make an informed decision.\n\nCover the Basics: A phone interview is used as an initial candidate screening tool, so be sure to ask basic questions such as salary requirements and availability to rule out those who don\u2019t meet your criteria.\n\nKeep it short. Aim to make the interview around 30 minutes. This gives you enough time to explain the position, ask questions, and answer any inquires the candidate may have.\n\nTake Notes: While you may think you\u2019ll remember all of the person\u2019s responses, there\u2019s a good chance you won\u2019t \u2500 especially if you\u2019re talking with a number of candidates. Taking notes allows you to retain the key points of the interview, so you\u2019re not left confused later on when trying to determine what each person said.\n\nFind a Quiet Space: If you don\u2019t have your own office to conduct the call, reserve a conference room or another quiet area for the interview. Constantly having to interrupt the candidate or ask them to repeat themselves is distracting and can make you appear unprofessional.\n\nLooking for outstanding professionals to fill open positions at your organization?
