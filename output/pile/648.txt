    "text": "Confirmed late Thursday, US software manufacturer Symantec Corporation (NASDAQ: SYMC), the maker of the popular Norton Antivirus software, will be splitting the company into two publicly traded companies with specific focuses.\n\nSymantec announced that one firm would be focused on security while the other will be focused on information storage and management. Symantec had explored the possibility of spinoffs in the past, but had shelved the idea until now. The news of Symantec\u2019s spinoffs came in lieu of other struggling technology companies, such as eBay Inc. (NASDAQ: EBAY) and Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ), spinning off their business divisions.\n\nThe division of struggling technology firms\u2019 core businesses seems to be a common trend and should prove to be a very economically efficient model. The splitting of the businesses would allow the new entities to become more focused on specific tasks leading to heightened efficiency and increased profitability hence making the company more appealing to investors and possible takeover offers.\n\nCurrently, Symantec\u2019s storage business accounts for 38% of Symantec\u2019s revenues with an operating margin of 23%, but the company that is on most analysts\u2019 radars is Symantec\u2019s cyber security business. This division has really struggled as competition heats up with a new generation of cyber security firms such as FireEye (NASDAQ: FEYE) and Palo Alto Networks (NYSE: PANW), entering the market.\n\nAccording to analysts, Symantec is not as innovative as the other cyber security firms currently in existence. The newer firms are able to offer a new generation of products to businesses who are more worried than ever about the threats of cyber-attacks. Analysts also believe that Symantec\u2019s security\u2019s business model is not monetized as well as their competitors.\n\nAs of now, Symantec has not decided on how to distribute the new shares among the two new companies. The spinoffs are expected to be finalized by December 2015."
