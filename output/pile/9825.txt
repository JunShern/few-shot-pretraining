On the hardware, a buffer is created to be able to hold one entire trigger shot, which may fail if it does not fit to the RAM.\nOften a long trigger duration is used causing this problem. Then, the soultion is to measure continuously, which the user most of the time wants instead.\nSee http://www.dspace.com/faq?408\n15kHz is quite fast for the ds1104, by the way, try with litte # of measurements if it works.\nRegards, the dspace support :)\n(I answered just because i found this question randomly, please contact support@dspace.de (or your local dSPACE company) if you need us!\n\n"
