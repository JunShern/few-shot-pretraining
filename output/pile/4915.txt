Why is perl doing this, and is there anything I can change to make this work as I expect it to?\nI am using Strawberry Perl version 5.28.\n\nA:\n\nWindows builds of Perl adds a :crlf layer to handles by default. This converts CRLF to LF on read, and LF to CRLF on write. (Some other languages do something similar.)\nYou need to tell Perl it's not a text file. Unfortunately, one can't do that with ARGV, the special handle you are using.\nperl -pe\"BEGIN { binmode STDOUT }\" example.txt >example.new.txt\nmove example.new.txt example.txt\n\n"
