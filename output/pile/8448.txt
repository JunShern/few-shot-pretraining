    "text": "Donald Trump is afraid of a rebellion by Electoral College members who will break ranks and choose someone else for president, denying him the 270 votes needed when that body meets next week in the final stage of the 2016 election.\n\nTrump\u2019s fears are laid out in a lawsuit filed Monday in Colorado, where two Democrats on that party\u2019s Electoral College slate have sued over a stage law that binds its Electoral College members to the popular vote outcome. They are part of the Hamilton Electors group, who are seeking to stop Trump from becoming president.\n\n\u201cWe are a group founded by several members of the Electoral College dedicated to support [Alexander] Hamilton\u2019s vision that members of the Electoral College should be free to vote their conscience for the good of America,\u201d their website says. \u201cWe believe that Hamilton had somebody very much like Donald Trump in mind when he charged Electors in Federalist 68 with safeguarding the office of the presidency.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn 2016 we\u2019re dedicated to putting political parties aside and putting America first,\u201d they said. \u201cElectors have already come forward calling upon other Electors from both red and blue states to unite behind a Responsible Republican candidate for the good of the nation.\u201d\n\nThe Colorado suit brought by Democratic electors Polly Baca and Robert Nemanich terrifies Trump, because it could state a federal court precedent that would free electors across the U.S. from being bound by state laws to vote for their state\u2019s popular vote winner. The Constitution doesn\u2019t say that Electoral College members will be subject to such rules. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a8\u00e2\u20ac\u00a8\u201cDespite their prior commitment to honor the outcome of Colorado\u2019s presidential election, Plaintiffs now claim they might consider voting for people other than Secretary Clinton and Senator Kaine,\u201d Trump\u2019s motion to intervene in the lawsuit said. \u201cOf course, President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence have more than enough electoral votes to secure their respective offices.\u201d\n\nThat last assertion is not quite right and is refuted by their motion\u2019s continuing argument.\n\n\u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit, however, threatens to undermine the many laws in other states that sensibly bind their electors\u2019 votes to represent the will of the citizens, undermining the Electoral College in the process. That is why the President-elect and his Campaign seek to intervene in this case,\u201d they said. \u201cShould this Court conclude (despite decades of legal and historical precedent to the contrary) that it is unconstitutional for Colorado to bind its presidential electors, similar statutes in other states where the President-elect won may also be in jeopardy. The President-elect and his Campaign therefore have a direct, substantial, and legally protectable interest in preventing the invalidation of Colorado\u2019s law requiring presidential electors to honor both their prior commitment and the voters\u2019 will.\"\n\nTrump\u2019s filing is yet more evidence that he is paying close attention to the legal efforts that challenge his fitness for office and could stop him from assuming the presidency. He and Republicans stopped a recount in Michigan, and were successful in limiting ballot scrutiny in recounts in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Trump knows his ascent to the presidency hangs on the Electoral College\u2019s antiquated system that overrides the popular vote. Hillary Clinton won 2.85 million more votes than Trump nationally.\n\nThe question, of course, is how many potential electors would break ranks and how might that play out. So far, nine Democratic electors have endorsed the effort and one Republican \u2013 Chris Suprun of Texas \u2013 has signaled support as well. These are some of the same electors that called for CIA to brief them on their until recently secret report that showed how Russia helped Trump. Right now Clinton has 232 Electoral College votes and Trump has 306. To win, 270 votes are needed.\n\nIt\u2019s not as simple as saying that Clinton needs 38 more votes, because some of the Hamilton electors might not support her even if they don't want Trump. It is anybody\u2019s guess how many Republican electors are willing to break ranks. One source said as many as a dozen GOP electors are leaning that way, but that\u2019s far short of the 40-to-50 needed to prevent Trump from becoming president.\n\n\u201cThe Founding Fathers intended the Electoral College to stop an unfit man from becoming President,\u201d the Hamilton Electors' homepage said. \u201cThe Constitution they crafted gives us this tool. Conscience demands that we use it.\u201d\n\n\n\n"
