We still don\u2019t know that much about them, but since then they\u2019ve generated quite a buzz. This new trio is set to release the track early next year on IAMSOUND Records and we can now have a listen to Northern Lights\u2019 B-side. The pounding In Your Eyes.\n\nIn Your Eyes presents a huge sound, with a sonic pallet not dissimilar to mid-80s Depeche Mode, with razor sharp digital synths and an almost Industrial feel. The rousing vocal slips between chilly ScandiPop and euphoric exuberance with ease which the rhythm heavy music is compellingly relentless whist holing on to a tundral edge. There have, of course, been many comparisons to The Knife (something seemingly unavoidable for Scandinavian ElectroPop acts), but Kate Boy display more of an IndiePop sensibility in their tunes, and we can\u2019t wait to hear more."
