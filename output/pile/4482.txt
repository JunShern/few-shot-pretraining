New paint since these pictures. Great cruiser, always turns heads as there are few of these around and is always the only one at the car show!\n\nThanks, yes the paint came out better than I had hoped. Glad the painter put lots on (single stage/no clear coat) Still a few areas to go over again with some 3000 paper and polish, but shouldn't take too long to look even better!"
