    "text": "Oblon's Post-Grant Practice Group handles all aspects of USPTO post issuance proceedings, including practice before the Patent Trial & Appeal Board (PTAB), and appeals to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC).\n\nass=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1402\" title=\"denied\" src=\"http://www.patentspostgrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/denied-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"denied\" width=\"85\" height=\"88\" />As first reported by PatentsPostGrant.com in November 2009, the patent reexaminations of NTP vs. RIM infamy were soundly shot down by the BPAI.[1] In November of 2009, the BPAI began issuing a series of decisions affirming the rejections of the five NTP patents.\n\nAs expected, in December of 2009, NTP requested the BPAI rehear arguments in these cases. Earlier this month, the BPAI, in tersely worded responses, denied rehearing in the \u2019592 \u2018172, and \u2018960 patents. As the issues in the \u2018670 and \u2018451 patent are common, namely, consideration of certain declaration and the public availability of certain prior art, it is expected that the remaining two denials will follow shortly. Next stop for NTP is the Federal Circuit.\n\nThe Federal Circuit will be quite busy with NTP in the coming months. In addition to the five patents noted above, NTP has two additional appeals from the BPAI headed to the court.\n\nNTP patent, 5,438,611 appears to be out in front of the pack of (7) appeals, with the first formal CAFC appeal notice filed this past January. The \u2018611 Patent, and NTP patent 5,479,472 were asserted against Sprint, T-Mobile, AT&T and Palm, in 2006. As with the five patents above, the BPAI mostly affirmed the rejections applied in reexamination.\n\nStay tuned.\n\n[1] Rejection of all claims were affirmed in 6,317,592, 5,819,172, and 6,067,451; Rejections were affirmed-in-part in 5,436,960 and 5,625,670, (the surviving \u2018670 claims appear to have been added in reexamination, claim 15 of the \u2018960 appears to be the only surviving claim successfully asserted against RIM)\n\nThe opinions, commentary and characterizations provided to this online forum by the authors and moderators are provided for encouraging discussion, thought and debate on important post grant issues.
