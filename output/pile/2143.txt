During his recent State of the Union, President Trump referred to Iran as a \u201cradical regime\u201d who does \u201cbad things.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy administration has acted decisively to confront the world\u2019s leading state sponsor of terror: the radical regime in Iran,\u201d Trump said Tuesday evening, delivering his address in the U.S. House of Representatives. \u201cThey do bad, bad things. To ensure this corrupt dictatorship never acquires nuclear weapons, I withdrew the United States from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal,\u201d he said, referring to the 2015 sanctions-relief-for-nuclear-rollback agreement negotiated under President Barack Obama. \u201cAnd last fall, we put in place the toughest sanctions ever imposed by us on a country. \u201cWe will not avert our eyes from a regime that chants death to America and threatens genocide against the Jewish people,\u201d he continued, to applause, mostly from the Republican side. \u201cWe must never ignore the vile poison of anti-Semitism, or those who spread its venomous creed.\u201d\n\nYesterday, CBS News reported from Tehran where hundred of thousands of Iranians were celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution.\n\nSpeaking in the capital Tehran, President Hassan Rouhani told a huge crowd Iran didn\u2019t need to ask the world\u2019s permission to develop missiles, and it would continue to build up its military power despite U.S. sanctions.\n\nSome of the people in the crowd were old enough to have actually participated in the revolution, but for the younger ones, the Islamic Republic that followed is the only country they\u2019ve ever known. That means all they\u2019ve ever known is a relationship with the U.S. that ranges from hostile, to downright toxic.\n\nNow, according to the Free Beacon \u2013 Iran is being accused of committing cyber attacks on the U.S. and of recruiting a U.S. Air Force member to steal classified information from the U.S. government, including the identities of U.S. agents.\n\nThe Trump administration has announced a new package of sanctions on Iranian entities tied to the cyber backing of U.S. individuals, a move that comes on the heels of American authorities indicting a U.S. Air Force officer who allegedly tried to pass classified information to Tehran after defecting to the country.\n\nThe Department of Justice has announced early Wednesday that it had indicted Monica Elfriede Witt, also known as Fatemah Zahra, a former active duty U.S. Air Force Intelligence Specialist and Special Agent, for attempting to pass classified American information to Iran.\n\nThe disclosure of this information leak was timed to coincide with an announcement by the Treasury Department that it is sanctioning a handful of Iranian entities for their role in cyber hacks on Americans.\n\nThe sanctions hit an Iranian-based entity tied to the country\u2019s Revolutionary Guards Corps, or IRGC. This includes \u201cefforts to recruit and collect intelligence from foreign attendees [of various conferences], including U.S. persons, and four associated individuals,\u201d according to the Treasury Department.\n\nShould Trump appoint a new Supreme Court Justice before the election?\n\nYes No Just show the results\n\nEnter your email to see the results... *\n\nName This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n\nCompleting this poll entitles you to 100 Percent Fed Up updates free of charge.
