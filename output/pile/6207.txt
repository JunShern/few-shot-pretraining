This is a reciprocal discipline matter.\nOn June 25, 2019, the Office of Lawyer Regulation (OLR) filed a\ntwo-count complaint against Attorney Gordon C. Ring.                   Count one\nalleged    that   by   virtue   of   Attorney    Ring's      recent      two-year\n\nlicense suspension by the Illinois Supreme Court, Attorney Ring\nshould be subject to reciprocal discipline in Wisconsin pursuant\nto SCR 22.22.     Count two alleged by failing to notify the OLR of\nhis disbarment in Illinois within 20 days of the effective date\nof the imposition of such discipline, Attorney Ring violated\n\f                                                                   No.   2019AP1148-D\n\n\n\nSupreme     Court      Rule   (SCR) 22.22(1).1         After     service    of      the\ncomplaint,       the     parties    stipulated        to   the     imposition        of\nreciprocal    discipline.          We    approve   the     stipulation,       and    we\ntherefore     order      a    two-year     suspension      of    Attorney     Ring's\nWisconsin law license.\n     \u00b62     Attorney Ring's law license history is as follows.                       He\nwas admitted to practice law in Wisconsin in May 1984, and in\nIllinois in November 1977.               His Wisconsin disciplinary history\nconsists    of    a    six-month      suspension      in   1992,    as   discipline\nreciprocal to that imposed on him by the Illinois Supreme Court\nfor professional misconduct.             See In re Disciplinary Proceedings\n\nAgainst Ring, 168 Wis. 2d 817, 484 N.W.2d 336 (1992).                       Attorney\n\nRing did not petition for reinstatement of his Wisconsin law\nlicense; it remains suspended.                 Attorney Ring's Wisconsin law\nlicense was also administratively suspended in 1985 for failure\nto comply with continuing legal education requirements, and in\n2011 for failure to pay State Bar dues.                     His license remains\nadministratively suspended.\n     \u00b63     On    September     20,     2018,   the    Illinois     Supreme      Court\nsuspended Attorney Ring's Illinois law license for two years,\n\n     1   SCR 22.22(1) provides:\n\n          An attorney on whom public discipline for\n     misconduct or a      license suspension for medical\n     incapacity has been imposed by another jurisdiction\n     shall promptly notify the director of the matter.\n     Failure to furnish the notice within 20 days of the\n     effective date of the order or judgment of the other\n     jurisdiction constitutes misconduct.\n\n\n                                           2\n\f                                                                    No.     2019AP1148-D\n\n\n\neffective October 11, 2018, for multiple counts of misconduct,\nand   ordered      him     to   reimburse      the   Illinois     Client    Protection\nProgram Trust Fund for any payments arising from his misconduct\nprior      to    the     end    of    his    suspension.         According     to    the\nallegations in the OLR's complaint and the Illinois disciplinary\nrecords attached to the complaint, Attorney Ring's misconduct in\nIllinois        included       misappropriation      of   over    $124,000     in    two\nclient matters, and, in a third matter, failing to work on a\ncase after the filing of the complaint, causing the case to be\ndismissed.        Attorney Ring did not tell his client that he had\nfailed to work on the case or that it had been dismissed, and he\nlater used funds in his client trust account belonging to others\n\nto make a $10,000 payment to his client to resolve the matter.\nBy his conduct, Attorney Ring violated Rules 1.3, 1.4(a)(3),\n1.15(a),        3.2,   8.4(c),       and    8.4(d)   of   the    Illinois    Rules    of\nProfessional Conduct.\n      \u00b64        On July 15, 2019, after the OLR's complaint had been\nserved on Attorney Ring but before a referee had been appointed,\n\nAttorney Ring entered into a stipulation with the OLR whereby he\nagreed that the facts alleged in the OLR's complaint supported a\ntwo-year suspension of his Wisconsin law license as reciprocal\ndiscipline to that imposed by the Illinois Supreme Court.\n      \u00b65        Supreme Court Rule 22.22(3) states as follows:\n\n      (3) The supreme court shall impose the identical\n      discipline or license suspension unless one or more of\n      the following is present:\n\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\f                                                                      No.    2019AP1148-D\n\n\n      (a) The procedure in the other jurisdiction was so\n      lacking in notice or opportunity to be heard as to\n      constitute a deprivation of due process.\n\n      (b) There was such an infirmity of proof establishing\n      the misconduct or medical incapacity that the supreme\n      court could not accept as final the conclusion in\n      respect to the misconduct or medical incapacity.\n\n      (c) The misconduct justifies substantially different\n      discipline in this state.\n      \u00b66   Attorney Ring does not claim that any of the defenses\nfound in SCR 22.22(3) apply.             Attorney Ring further states that\nthe stipulation did not result from plea bargaining; that he\n\nunderstands the allegations against him; that he understands the\nramifications should the court impose the stipulated level of\ndiscipline;      that   he    understands     his       right    to     contest      this\nmatter; that he understands his right to consult with counsel,\nand   represents    that     he   has   consulted with          counsel;      that    his\nentry into the stipulation is made knowingly and voluntarily;\nand that his entry into the stipulation represents his decision\nnot to contest the misconduct alleged in the complaint or the\nlevel and type of discipline sought by the OLR's director.\n\n      \u00b67   Upon     our      review     of   the       matter,     we       accept   the\nstipulation and impose discipline identical to that imposed by\nthe   Illinois     Supreme    Court;     i.e.,     a    two-year       suspension     of\nAttorney Ring's Wisconsin law license.                  Because this matter was\nresolved by means of a stipulation, the OLR has not sought the\nimposition of costs, and we impose none.\n\n\n\n\n                                         4\n\f                                                      No.    2019AP1148-D\n\n\n\n     \u00b68    IT IS ORDERED that the license of Gordon C. Ring to\npractice law in Wisconsin is suspended for two years, effective\nthe date of this order.\n     \u00b69    IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, to the extent he has not\nalready done so, Gordon C. Ring shall comply with the provisions\nof SCR 22.26 concerning the duties of a person whose license to\npractice law in Wisconsin has been suspended.\n     \u00b610   IT   IS   FURTHER   ORDERED   that   compliance   with    all\nconditions of this order is required for reinstatement.              See\n\nSCR 22.29(4)(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                   5\n\f1\n\f"
