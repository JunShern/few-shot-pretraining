    "text": "\n\nIOS app store has created unrealistic pricing expectations - kgutteridge\nhttp://appcubby.com/blog/5-is-the-new-10/\n\n======\njeremymcanally\nI think I prefer an open market with prices that have naturally fallen to this\npoint than something with artificially inflated prices. There are two things\nat play here.\n\nOne, the competition in the app store right now is so voluminous and so fierce\nthat it's driving prices down. It's a natural phenomenon that will happen in\nnearly any \"free\" market. To complain about it is to complain about the\nessence of free market pricing.\n\nSecond, these lower prices allow for higher volume of sales. The prices have\nsettled here because this is what users see as the value of these apps. No\noffense to these guys/gals, but I wouldn't pay $10 for something to track my\ngas mileage. I'd find a free web app (if they exist) or just keep it in a\nnote. I get the value-add of IRS compliant reporting and such, but that's a\nniche problem to solve. Charging $10 for that is fine, but don't expect mass\nmarket appeal or uptake.\n\nI think the biggest problem is that people who write niche apps like these\napps expect to see numbers like \"Fart-O-Matic 9000\" or \"Angry Birds.\" You\nwon't. Accept that and then figure out what's going to make you the most\nmoney. The trick is figuring out if pricing at $10 and making (x) sales is\nmore profitable than pricing at $1 and making (y) sales. For some developers,\npricing higher with lower volume is much, much better, and these developers\nare typically niche applications (take a look at some of the \"pro\" audio apps\non iPad especially) that can handle the price difference because the people\nseeking them REALLY need the value that they're offering.\n\nAn MPG tracking app that gives me nice Excel sheets might not be enough to\nwarrant $10 in the eyes of users, and I don't think that's necessarily Apple's\nfault or the market's fault. Maybe it's just that the niche you're targeting\nwon't sustain the price you want, and unfortunately, that's the way the cookie\ncrumbles when selling software like this.\n\n~~~\ncageface\nAs an author of one semi-pro audio app, I can tell you that even the \"pro\"\napps are selling for as little as 1/10th of the price of a similar app on a\nMac. I really doubt the sales volumes compensate for that.\n\nThe big problem with the app store is that the people on the very high end of\nthe power distribution dictate a pricing structure for everyone that only\nreally works for those moving huge volumes. People now have a preconceived\nidea of what an app should cost that often has nothing to do with how much it\nmust actually sell for in order to turn a profit.\n\n~~~\ntechnoslut\nI'm assuming that you mean prosumer apps. I haven't seen these on iOS. The\nonly app that I've seen that is better on iOS is the official Twitter app.\n\nThen again, I haven't seen traditionally big devs on the Mac release Acorn,\nFlare, and Pixelmator on iOS.\n\n~~~\ncageface\nFor example, an excellent synth app like this would probably sell for at\n_least_ $99 as a plugin for Mac/PC: <http://beepstreet.com/horizon>\n\nI don't know for sure but I'd be very surprised if it's moving 20x the units\nit would as a plugin. But if you price something like this above $10 you'll\nget all kinds of user outrage because that's not what an \"app\" should cost.\n\n~~~\ntechnoslut\nI'm listening to the link of the app and it is good but people have to be\naware of it. This is the third synth app I've seen. I've also seen Animoog\nthat was posted on The Verge.\n\nThe fault is that these apps need more advertisements. I'm willing to bet that\nmost don't know that they can create music with a low-priced app. Consumers\nneed to be made aware of this. There are YouTube videos destined to be made\nwith these kind of apps.\n\nFor example, I saw an Sprint iPhone ad yesterday (maybe you've seen it?) where\na guy is talking to his girlfriend while watching a game. All I gathered from\nthe commercial was that the iPhone was on Sprint. They didn't give me the app\nor whether the game was live. The commercial became immediately insignificant.\n\n~~~\ncageface\nI don't think marketing is the answer here. Every musician I know with an iOS\ndevice knows about this app. The problem is that the potential audience for\nsomething like this is never going to be big enough to make the Angry Birds\npricing model work.\n\n~~~\ntechnoslut\nI've seen some that hate movies or TV but I've never seen anyone who doesn't\nlike music or wants ti create it, even on a superficial level.\n\nAngry Birds is an outlier. Their success had as much to do with quiet\nadvertising than any blog could do.\n\nAt the end of the day, everyone wants to create \u2013 even it is something\ndifferent with an usual set of apps.\n\nSome believe that iOS is only meant to consume. I don't believe that. Apple\nhas essentially released iWork and GarageBand in subsequent iPad releases.\n\n------\nMBCook\nThe kick the tires problem is a big one for me. I've downloaded enough free\napps that are junk. Downloading a paid app that has all sorts of problems is\nvery annoying, so I usually wait quite a while before buying something for\nreview to come in.\n\nThis makes me a little hesitant to try $ and $2 apps, even though\nrealistically that's a trivial amount of money. But if an app is $5 or $10,\nthen I really want a chance to try it first. Many apps don't have 'lite'\nversions (since, IIRC, demos are forbidden).\n\nJust having some kind of 2 hour return/refund policy would really help.\n\n------\ncrazygringo\nI think a lot of people may have a \"mental budget\" for apps -- e.g. spending\n$5/mo. on apps seems reasonable to me, while spending $50/mo. is not.\n\nSo if apps were $10, I would buy 1 every couple months, instead of 2-3/mo like\nI do now.\n\nFor example, I'll buy a $0.99 remote desktop connection app to connect to my\nserver from anywhere, that I will use maybe 3 times ever. But I will not buy\nit for $10.\n\nSo I'm not convinced that higher app prices would necessarily translate into\nhigher revenue.\n\nAlso, remember that we can't compare piracy-free iPhone app pricing (ignoring\njailbreakers) with normal software pricing. Every purchased copy of Photoshop\n\"subsidizes\" n other people who use it for free. So on any piracy-free\nplatform, you might expect prices to be lower.\n\n------\njiaaro\nThis will fix itself -- _if_ he is correct that people _want_ iOS apps (read:\ngames) that reach parity with other handheld devices.\n\n1\\. Developers will start making simpler games to maintain profitability at\nthe $5 price point.\n\n2\\. Once the vast majority of iOS games are $5 and relatively shallow in\ncomparison with other devices, deeper more complex games will once again\ncontrast in value to the $5 games, allowing them to charge more money.\n\n3\\. Because of the \"monthly budget\" effect, I'm guessing the way this will\nwork is in-app purchases. X-Box has been very successful with this model. Sell\na full (but somewhat short) game for $5. Then allow the users to buy more\n\"content\" for $2 per unit.\n\na $5 game That allows you to buy multiplayer content, additional story, or\nother mods for a dollar or 2 at at time could easily get their average\nlifetime sales per game up to 7 or 8 dollars. (and the big name games could\nstart at $10 and total 12 to 15)\n\n __One more thing __\n\n\\--------------\n\nI think it's worth pointing out that price decreases in the longer term don't\nprove anything. This happens everywhere. Even on game consoles (Xbox, PS3,\nwii, etc) where the games start out costing upwards to $40.\n\nYou can always to to a game store and find older games on sale for $15.\n\n------\ngdilla\nThis article was written over 2 years ago, before Apple introduced in-app\npurchasing. Downward price pressure is a lot worse now than then. It's more\naccurate to say Freemium is the new $5. But bundling, and try and buy is now\navailable.\n\n------\ntechnoslut\nFrom the post:\n\n>Because of this, most developers I spoke with at WWDC (even the VERY\nsuccessful ones) were looking to spread risk among several small apps rather\nthan creating one amazing app.\n\nThis is their loss. This garbage of having 15 different apps to accomplish a\njob that can be done with one will eventually be finished whether it is on the\niPhone or iPad.\n\nMuch of the App Store is about word of mouth and less about price. If you give\na comprehensive app that is worth the price and has proper dev support, the\npayers will be there.\n\nToday, I need an incredible amount of apps just to do what would take 5\nminutes on Photoshop. An opening is left on iOS by Adobe to fill the solution.\nVirtually no one is doing this.\n\nJobs' intention was not to hurt devs, but to kill piracy, reduce software\npricing and make it safe for people to get apps without worrying about\nmalware. Some devs may no longer exist because they can't adapt but that is\nnot his fault.\n\nThe main mistake Apple has made so far is not allowing a trial period for apps\nor offering refunds within a certain window.\n\n~~~\nrogerchucker\nI thought those \"lite\" versions are essentially the \"trial period\" apps.\nRefund window is problematic as Google witnessed (and thus stopped it); but\nthen again, if your app cannot provide me long term value then may be you\ndeserve a refund.\n\n~~~\njiaaro\nWhat they really need is a way to link the demo and full version together in\nthe app store.\n\nApps with a \"demo\" version should have a seamless upgrade-to-paid-version\nexperience.\n\nSome apps have done this with via in-app purchases (check out living language\nfor example [http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/living-language-spanish-\nfor/i...](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/living-language-spanish-\nfor/id453341418?mt=8)) which does a great job of this and manages to get $15\nout of you by demonstrating the value the app provides very effectively before\nasking for money.\n\n------\njyap\nFirstly, as someone else pointed out, this was written over 2 years ago.\n\nPricing must also take into account the distribution power of the app store\nand the actual usage medium.\n\niPad app prices are higher is a good example but then again this was written\npre-iPad.\n\n------\nPhuFighter\nBah. There are so many apps that I purchased that are complete junk, that,\nIMO, paying a $0.99 for an app that I do use seems to even itself out. And\nwhat about completely fraudulent apps (e.g. search for \"blacklist\" in the App\nStore). How are they even getting in?\n\nGiven the huge amount of crap in the App store, the only real way of finding\nthings that are decent is to go to specialized aggregators. I go to\nBoardGameGeek in order to find reviews of games. The detailed reviews there\nmean more to me than the huge stinking pile of games in the App Store. There\nneeds to be a better way of sifting through the stuff in the App Store than\nusing the App Store Application itself.\n\n~~~\ndrbarnard\nDon't you see the problem there. The developers who build crap apps end up\nbeing rewarded the same as those who build great apps. Essentially, you're\nsaying that you do pay $5 for a great app because you buy 5 and keep 1, but\nthe developer who built the app you like gets just $1. That sucks.\n\n~~~\nerichocean\nThat's the situation with \"entertainment\" content generally., e.g. all movies\nat the theater cost the same.\n\nAnd just like with movies, review sites, massive advertising to move units and\ncreate awareness, and a general distrust of new things is where I'd expect the\nApp Store model to continue to go.\n\n------\ncrazygringo\nAlso, I'd love to have a way to pay for apps _after_ I've been using them for\na while. For example, I would never have bought Instapaper in the first place\nfor $10, but now that I use it every day, I would be very happy to contribute\neven $20.\n\nIt would be fascinating from a psychology standpoint to see what kinds of\nresults this might have.\n\n~~~\ngharbad\nAt a large scale, it approaches $0/user.\n\n~~~\ncrazygringo\nCitation?\n\nFor example, the business model of Evernote would seem to suggest otherwise.\n\n------\nprpatel\nThere's one thing that everyone has missed so far, and I've said it to anyone\nwho will listen: free apps are undermining both the app store(s) and the\ndeveloper. Before you brush me off as crazy, please think it through...\n\n~~~\ndrbarnard\nI started to reply to your comment and ended up writing a whole blog post in\nagreement: <http://appcubby.com/blog/free-and-low-cost-apps/>\n\n------\njemeshsu\nApp programmers are turning into like recording artists, where tunes are at\n99cents a pop. The only way to survive then is to have hit app, like in hit\nsongs. Maybe there will be a billboard type of chart for apps soon.\n\n~~~\nrogerchucker\nIf you wanna stick to that analogy, what would be the equivalent of a \"live\nconcert\" in the app world?\n\n------\nNameNickHN\nIt has nothing to do with pricing in itself and all with competition. Look at\nthe gps navigation software. They cost more than the average app. Obviously\nbecause there is no real or very little competition in that area.\n\n~~~\ngeon\nMap databases are very expensive. You can't just use Google Maps for\nnavigation, because of the licensing.\n\n------\ndrbarnard\nI just finished a followup post, since the one originally linked is over 2\nyears old.\n\n<http://appcubby.com/blog/free-and-low-cost-apps/>\n\n------\ngcanyon\nEveryone realizes this article is from 2009, right?\n\n------\nhuhtenberg\nThat's a very well designed blog if you don't mind me saying.\n\n~~~\ndrbarnard\nI don't mind. Thanks! Since the site is mostly an ad for my apps, I thought\nI'd have some fun with a graphics heavy approach.\n\n"
