    "text": "Lessons from Limbo\n\nFr. John Breck\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church recently announced that it is closing the doors on \"limbo.\" For important theological reasons, this is a good thing. Yet it gives us cause to reflect a little on our own\nunderstanding of the state of existence after death and on the development of theology within the\nChurch.\n\nDeveloped by medieval Latin theologians, limbo was conceived on the one hand as the abode of\ndeceased pious souls of the Old Covenant who were awaiting the coming of the Messiah. This is the\nlimbus patrum, not unlike \"sheol\" in biblical and Orthodox iconographic tradition. (Our Paschal\nicon, often referred to as \"the Descent of Christ into Hell,\" is in fact a descent into hades or\nsheol.) More significant, and much more problematic, was the hypothesis, put forth by medieval\nLatin Doctors of the Church, that there exists as well a limbus infantium, a place where unbaptized\ninfants spend eternity. According to Aquinas, these children \u00ad victims of miscarriage, abortion or\ninfant mortality \u00ad dwell forever in this domain of \"natural happiness,\" but they are deprived of\nthe full blessedness of heaven and, consequently, of the hope that they will dwell in communion\nwith other redeemed family members. These versions of limbo, by the way, were quite distinct from\nthe teaching about purgatory, which is conceived as a place of purifying punishment for \"venial\"\n(as opposed to \"mortal\") sins, for which forgiveness is necessary in order for the deceased person\nto attain the \"beatific vision\" or salvation. Neither purgatory nor limbo has found a place in\ntraditional Orthodox teaching.\n\nBefore he ascended to the Papacy, Pope Benedict XVI had already expressed doubts about the\nusefulness (or accuracy) of limbo, calling it a \"theological hypothesis.\" Since Vatican II,\nCatholic theologians and pastors have tended to ignore this theologoumenon, but the dogma behind it\nwas never formally reassessed. Originating with Augustine, that dogma reflects a Latin\nunderstanding of the effects of \"original sin.\" Passages such as Romans 5:12 were (mis)interpreted\nso as to imply that the \"original sin\" of Adam is transmitted, rather like a defective gene, to all\nfuture generations. Therefore any conceived child bears \"the sin of Adam\" and consequently bears\nAdam's guilt. That guilt, and its mortal consequences, are removed only by baptism. If a child dies\nbefore being baptized, according to this view, it is still stained with original sin and cannot\nenjoy the beatific vision.. Yet it was also recognized that such children are innocent of any\npersonal sin. Thus it became necessary to conceive of a domain, realm or state in which such\nchildren would spend eternity, one that is distinct from the punishments of hell but equally devoid\nof eternal blessedness. This conundrum, based on a noble but defective theological logic, led to\nthe notion of limbo.\n\nIf the logic is defective, it is because the underlying presupposition is false. The consensus of\nEastern patristic tradition, and of Orthodox theologians today, is that the \"original sin\" of Adam\nis not transmitted (sexually or by any other means) from generation to generation like an inherited\ndisease. Rather, what we inherit or receive from creation of the \"first man Adam\" (who represents\nall of humanity) is the consequence of sin, namely mortality, death. \"As sin came into the world\nthrough one man [Adam], and death through sin, so death spread to all men because all men sinned . . . \"\n(Rom 5:12).\n\nThe first lesson from limbo, then, is that it is usually not enough to do away with unfortunate\n(i.e., useless, deceptive or simply incorrect) theological hypotheses. It is just as necessary to\nlook at the underlying theological reasoning behind those hypotheses, and correct that as well.\nMany Roman Catholic theologians have done just that, and many have modified the traditional Latin\nview of the transmission of original sin. But many have not, and the consequence is twofold. On the\none hand, one must still presume that Catholic teaching holds that infants are conceived, bearing\nAdam's guilt; yet on the other, without \"limbo\" the consequences of that state of being are totally\nup in the air: theoretically they cannot be admitted into heaven, but they surely cannot be\nconsigned to eternal hell.\n\nThe real issue is far broader than the matter of limbo. It concerns nothing less than the Latin\nunderstanding of redemption and the role of baptism in that process. By eliminating limbo, are\nCatholic theologians saying as well that in fact there is no real \"inheritance\" or transmission of\noriginal sin as such, but only of its deadly consequences? Are they now accepting a view of\nredemption that is less juridical (a forensic removal of sin and guilt) and more existential and\necclesial (incorporating the believer into the death and resurrection of Christ)? And does this\nmean that they now hold that unbaptized babies \u00ad and all children not yet conscious of sin and able\nto repent \u00ad are admitted upon death into the full glory of heaven, by a God whose mercy far\noutstrips His requirements for justice? If so, they are aligning themselves more closely with the\nOrthodox position than with their own theological heritage. (Such a realignment has in fact been in\nevidence since Vatican II. See especially the Catechism of the Catholic Church, \u00a71257-1284, on the\nsacrament of baptism. This very biblical elaboration makes no mention of limbo, but states\nregarding children who have died without baptism: \"the Church can only entrust them to the mercy of\nGod, as she does in her funeral rites for them\" [1261].)\n\nLimbo was conceived as a response, misguided as it was, to a specific theological problem within\nRoman Catholicism. That problem concerned the very concept of God that the Latin Church held and\ntaught. In the late and post medieval periods, the Orthodox were exposed to varying degrees of\nLatin influence, and that influence has carried over, in North America especially, with the\nconversion to Orthodoxy of many former \"Uniates,\" Eastern Christians who had been in communion with\nRome. Other influences, from exaggerated monastic asceticism to misleading interpretations of\nScripture in our church schools, has created in the minds of many of our own faithful an image of\nGod that is more judgmental than merciful: a God of Justice, whose primary concern is to punish\nthose who do not fulfill His commandments.\n\nLike limbo, this conception of God is a popular one. It certainly does not reflect the traditional\nteaching of the Orthodox Church. Yet like limbo among many Catholics, it dwells in the back of many\nOrthodox people's minds, a good number of whom respond either by living in dread before divine\nwrath or by fleeing the Church altogether.\n\nPerhaps the most important lesson in all of this is that the Holy Spirit is calling and directing\nus constantly to return to the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Particular theologoumena, theological\nopinions, always need reassessing \u00ad not just for their specific content, but for the impact they\nmight have on the lives of our faithful. (A case in point is the \"toll houses,\" spheres of\npurification through which deceased persons pass on their journey toward heaven. There is room, to\nbe sure, for some such teaching within the Church \u00ad purification as an ongoing process, for example\n\u00ad as long as it does not become, as it so often does, distorted into a Gnostic image of\npurification through what amounts to torture, inflicted by powers more demonic than angelic.)\n\nThe primary question, made clear by the history of \"limbo,\" is this: To what degree does any given\nteaching or exposition of the faith actually reflect the witness of Holy Scripture and the Church's\nauthentic Tradition? To the extent that it does, then it should be retained; where it does not,\nthen the teaching needs to be reinterpreted so that it conforms faithfully to revealed Truth.\n\nBecause pious traditions \u00ad even erroneous ones \u00ad can have such a hold on the popular mind, it\nrequires courage, patience and a great deal of prayerful discernment in order to make this\ncontinual reassessment of our various theological interpretations. Nevertheless, we should not fear\nthe process. We should accept it as a function of the Church's Living Tradition, given and\nsustained by the Spirit of Truth.\n\nRead the entire article on the Orthodox Church of America website (new window will open).
