    "text": "INTRODUCTION {#s1}\n============\n\nUpper track urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) is less common than bladder urothelial carcinoma and accounts for 5--10% of all urothelial carcinoma.^[@b1]^ The incidence of ureteral urothelial carcinoma (UUC) is approximately half that of pyelocaliceal urothelial carcinoma.^[@b2]^ UUC has a worse prognosis than pyelocaliceal urothelial carcinoma.^[@b3],[@b4]^ Owing to different anatomical considerations and oncological outcomes in UTUC, these different malignant entities must be evaluated independently.^[@b5]^\n\nThe gold standard treatment for UTUC is radical nephroureterectomy with excision of the bladder cuff, regardless of the tumour location.^[@b6]^ Recently, conservative surgery such as endoscopic ablation or segmental ureteral resection, which allows preservation of the upper urinary renal unit, has also been applied.^[@b7]^ However, preoperative histological evaluation through biopsy of the upper urinary tract is difficult, because ureteroscopy is an invasive procedure and usually requires general anaesthesia. Furthermore, the accuracy of ureteroscopic biopsy in predicting tumour stage and grade is limited, and the limitations of endoscopic biopsy must be balanced against the possible advantage of avoiding radical surgery.^[@b8]^ Thus, accurate preoperative prediction of tumour grade could be helpful in selecting more appropriate therapeutic options.\n\nCT urography (CTU) is an imaging modality with high diagnostic accuracy in the detection of UTUC and has replaced intravenous excretory urography and ultrasonography as the first-line imaging test for investigating high-risk patients.^[@b9]^ Even though several studies have investigated diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) as an imaging assessment for predicting tumour grade of UTUC,^[@b10]--[@b11]^ characteristic CTU findings that can predict tumour grade of UUC have not been identified, to the best of our knowledge.\n\nIn this study, we aimed to evaluate the correlation between CTU imaging variables, including tumour size and imaging features, and histological grade of UUC, and to identify CTU imaging features that allow prediction of high-grade UUC, which should be treated by radical surgery.\n\nMETHODS AND MATERIALS {#s2}\n=====================\n\nPatients\n--------\n\nThis retrospective single-centre study was approved by the institutional review board at and written informed consent was not required. We searched institutional patient information systems to identify all consecutive patients with UUC who had undergone nephroureterectomy between January 2005 and July 2016. A total of 79 consecutive patients who underwent surgery with removal of a surgical specimen for histological analysis were registered. The inclusion criteria for this study were as follows: (i) tumours only located in the ureter, (ii) patients had undergone CTU scan prior to surgery and (iii) histologicalal confirmation of UUC with clear statement of histological grade according to the WHO 2004 classification system. Four patients were excluded because histological grade was not available in the pathological reports, and two patients did not undergo a CTU scan. Ultimately, 73 patients (52 males and 21 females; mean age, 68.92 \u00b1 9.08 years) with 81 UUCs were included in our study. All pathological data were reviewed by a board-certificated pathologist, and all tumours were classified into low-grade and high-grade groups according to the WHO 2004 classification system and pathologic T stage of the tumours was assessed according to the TNM staging system.\n\nCTU technique\n-------------\n\nAll CTU examinations were performed using various CT scanners from 16-channel to 128-channel MDCT scanners (Somatom Sensation 16, Siemens Healthcare, Brilliance 64, Philips Medical Systems, Best, Netherlands or Somatom Definition Flash 128, Siemens Healthcare Forchheim, Germany). Scanning parameters of the most frequently used CT scanner (Brilliance 64, Philips Medical Systems, Best, Netherlands) were as follows: tube voltage, 120 kVp; effective tube current, 300 mAs; section thickness, 5 mm; pitch and speed, 0.891:1; rotation time, 0.75 s and collimation, 64 \u00d7 0.625 mm for 64-channel MDCT. Before acquisition of contrast-enhanced scans, simple unenhanced scans were obtained, after which 2 ml kg^--1^ non-ionic contrast material containing 300--350 mg ml^\u22121^ of iodine \\[iomeprol (Iomeron 300, Bracco Altana Pharma, Konstanz, Germany), iopamidol (Pamiray 300, Dongkook Pharmaceutical, Seoul, Republic of Korea) or iobitridol (Xenetix 300, Guerbet, Villepinte, France)\\] was intravenously administered at a rate of 3.0 ml s^\u22121^ using a standard power injector. For CTU, in addition to the unenhanced scan, two-phase studies were performed with combinations of corticomedullary and excretory phases at our institution. The corticomedullary phase began 30--40 s after contrast administration, and excretory phases began 300 s after contrast administration, respectively.\n\nImage analysis\n--------------\n\nTwo radiologists (DJS and STH with 17 and 3 years of experience, respectively, in interpreting genitourinary images) independently reviewed all CTU images on a picture archiving and communication system workstation (INFINITT PACS, INFINITT Healthcare, Seoul, Republic of Korea). The readers knew all patients had been diagnosed with UUC, but were informed of neither the histological grade nor the findings listed in the initial radiological report. They evaluated the following CTU imaging features: tumour location, tumour size, tumour enhancement value, multiplicity, periureteral infiltration, enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes with a short axis of more than 1 cm, and hydronephrosis grade. Tumour location was categorized into three groups (proximal, middle, and distal) according to anatomic ureteral segmentation. Tumour size was determined as the maximal length or diameter of the whole tumour presenting as ureteral soft-tissue mass or enhancing wall thickening on the axial, sagittal, or coronal CTU images. In patients with multiple lesions, the largest one was selected for size measurement. Tumour enhancement value was calculated as the difference between attenuation values in the corticomedullary phase and unenhanced phase. On corticomedullary phase images, the readers drew a circular ROI that included the enhancing solid portion of the tumour, avoiding adjacent mesenteric fat. The ROI was as large as possible to minimize noise. A ROI of the same size was placed in the corresponding location on the unenhanced scan image.\n\nThe readers also reported hydronephrosis grade according to the modified version of the Society for Foetal Urology Hydronephrosis Grading System ([Table 1](#t1){ref-type=\"table\"}).\n\n###### \n\nModified version of the Society for Fetal Urology Hydronephrosis Grading System\n\n  Grade                             0               1                              2                                      3                                                              4\n  --------------------------------- --------------- ------------------------------ -------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------\n  Ureter and pelvocalyceal system   No dilatation   Local dilation of the ureter   Ureteral and renal pelvis dilatation   Ureteral and renal pelvis dilatation plus calices dilatation   Further dilatation of ureter, pelvis and calices\n  Renal parenchymal thickness       Normal          Normal                         Normal                                 Normal                                                         Thin\n\nStatistical analysis\n--------------------\n\nDescriptive statistics of means, standard deviations and frequencies were used to describe patient characteristics. Univariate logistic regression modelling, Mann--Whitney *U* tests, and *\u03a7*^2^ tests were used to assess the correlation between CTU imaging variables and histological tumour grade. Multiple logistic regression analysis using a backward selection method was performed to identify significantly independent CTU imaging variables that could predict high-grade tumours. Spearman correlation analysis was used to assess the correlation between tumour size and hydronephrosis grade. *\u03a7*^2^ test and linear-by-linear association were used to investigate the correlation of hydronephrosis grade and peritumoural intfiltration with pathologic T stage. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed to identify the cut-off value of effective factors that provided the best diagnostic accuracy. Interobserver agreement was calculated using kappa statistics for nominal values, including hydronephrosis grade, peritumoural infiltration, multiplicity and presence of enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes. Intraclass correlation was calculated for continuous values including tumour size and contrast enhancement value. The scores were used to define agreement as follows: 0.41--0.60 denoted moderate agreement; 0.61--0.80, good agreement and greater than 0.81, excellent agreement.\n\nStatistical analysis was done using IBM SPSS Statistics version 22.0 for Windows (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). A *p* value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\nRESULTS {#s3}\n=======\n\nImages of the 73 patients with 81 UUCs were reviewed. The lesions were unilateral in all cases. 15 patients (20.5%) had low-grade UUCs ([Figure 1](#f1){ref-type=\"fig\"}) and 58 patients (79.5%) had high-grade UUCs ([Figure 2](#f2){ref-type=\"fig\"}). 22 (27.1%) lesions were located in the proximal ureter, 14 (17.2%) in the middle ureter, and 45 (55.5%) in the distal ureter. Eight (5.8%) patients had multiple lesions in the ipsilateral ureter.

It is not possible to differentiate a T1 lesion from T2 UUC on CTU, and it is also difficult to obtain representative muscularis tissue with ureteroscopic biopsy. Even though T3 lesions can be characterized by periureteral infiltration, current imaging modalities cannot reliably identify microscopic invasion. Periureteral infiltration, which represents the invasiveness of UUC on CT, can cause overstaging due to additional inflammatory changes, while understaging can occur due to microscopic invasion.^[@b15]^ In our study, there was no significant correlation between periureteral infiltration on CT and tumour grade. In addition, periureteral infiltration on CT did not significantly correlate with pathologic T stage.\n\nIn clinical practice, tumour grade is a crucial factor in determining whether radical surgery or endoscopic conservative treatment is optimal for UUC, because accurate tumour staging is only available postoperatively based on the pathological evaluation of radical nephroureterectomy specimens. Ureteroscopic evaluation and biopsy definitively set up the diagnosis of UUC and provide fundamental information for risk stratification and clinical management. Several studies have reported that biopsy tumour grade accurately predicts surgical tumour grade in 78--91.6% of patients.^[@b16]--[@b18]^Contrary to these reports, it has been shown that ureteroscopic biopsy performance is inadequate in predicting final pathological grade.^[@b19],[@b20]^ Tumour grade is misinterpreted in more than one third of patients with conservatively managed UTUC,^[@b19]^ and 15% of high-grade tumours are underestimated as low-grade urothelial carcinoma.^[@b20]^\n\nDW-MRI has shown potential as an biomarker in oncological imaging practice, and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values obtained from DW-MRI may help predict tumour invasiveness and metastatic potential of UTUC.^[@b21]^ Some researchers report that high-grade UTUCs have significantly lower ADC values than low-grade tumours.^[@b10],[@b11]^ More recently, however, others have found no significant correlation between ADC value and histological grade of UTUC.^[@b12],[@b13]^ Furthermore, different imaging sequences, parameters, and MRI scanners can cause inconsistency in ADC measurement. Thus, our study aimed to determine whether CTU imaging features reproducible in routine practice could preoperatively predict the histological grade of UUC.\n\nThere have been a number of studies demonstrating an association between hydronephrosis and advanced clinicopathological features and poor oncologic outcomes in UTUC.^[@b22]--[@b27]^Pyelocaliceal urothelial carcinomas usually do not result in urinary tract obstruction except in tumours involving the ureteropelvic junction. In contrast, UUCs are more likely to have hydronephrosis compared to pyelocaliceal urothelial carcinomas.^[@b4]^ A few studies that focused on UUC alone also reported a predictive role of hydronephrosis in advanced pathological features.^[@b5],[@b28]^ Cho et al found that 86% of patients with hydronephrosis of Grade 3 or 4 had an invasive tumour of T2 stage or greater.^[@b28]^ However, their research was based on various imaging assessments using CT, excretory urography, and renal ultrasonography. In our study, there was no significant correlation between hydronephrosis grade and pathologic T stage. Luo et al reported that hydronephrosis of Grade 2 or higher was associated with non-organ-confined disease,^[@b5]^ although their imaging review was not performed either in consensus or independently, and the specificity was limited to 37.3%. Chung et al assumed that hydronephrosis may cause outward expansion and longitudinal thinning of the already narrow ureter or renal pelvis wall, which may facilitate the seeding of cancer cells to regional or distant organs.^[@b22]^ Even so, the mechanism of the development of hydronephrosis and its relationship with tumour invasiveness is not fully understood.^[@b5]^ To the best of our knowledge, however, our study is the first evaluation of the association between hydronephrosis grade and tumour grade in pure UUC, and adequate diagnostic performance (sensitivity and specificity over 79%) was obtained at a cut-off point of hydronephrosis Grade 3 in the prediction of high-grade tumours.\n\nCho et al reported that the tumour diameter of UUC correlated with pathological T stage and 80% of patients with a tumour diameter of 1.5 cm or greater had invasive UUC.^[@b28]^ In their study, however, tumour diameter was measured on axial CT images and was classified as less than 1.5 cm, greater than or equal to 1.5 cm but less than 2.5 cm, and 2.5 cm or greater. In our study, in which the largest tumour size was measured on multireconstructed images, tumour size did not independently predict tumour grade. In addition, our study showed no significant association between tumour size and hydronephrosis grade.\n\nAt the time of diagnosis, patients with UTUC and a contralateral normal kidney can be classified as having low-risk UTUC or high-risk UTUC.^[@b29]^ Preoperative clinical factors associated with low-risk UTUC include low-grade ureteroscopic biopsy, low-grade cytology, tumour size \\<1 cm, no invasive features on cross-sectional imaging, unifocal disease, and the availability of feasible close follow-up.^[@b29]^ According to the current European guidelines on UTUC,^[@b7]^ diagnostic ureteroscopy with biopsy should be performed in the preoperative assessment of UTUC. On the other hand, the routine use of ureteroscopy is not advocated for the confirmation of UTUC.^[@b30]^ Based on the results of our study, the need for ureteroscopy and biopsy may be obviated in patients with UUC causing hydronephrosis of Grade 3 or higher.\n\nThe current study has limitations. First, the study population was relatively small due to the rarity of UUC, and because the study was conducted retrospectively at a single institution, the possibility of selection bias should be considered. Prospective multicentre studies with larger sample size are needed to validate our results. Second, the direct imaging-pathological correlation was not obtained in tumour size assessed on CTU. Consequently, tumour size could have been overestimated if there was concomitant inflammation.\n\nIn conclusion, high-grade hydronephrosis on preoperative CTU was significantly associated with high-grade UUC. The results of the current study may help develop algorithms for risk stratification of patients with pure UUC. Radical surgical treatment should be considered in patients with UUC causing hydronephrosis of Grade 3 or higher regardless of tumour size and absence of peritumoural infiltration on CTU.\n"
