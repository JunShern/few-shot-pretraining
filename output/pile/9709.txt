Then I forgot, and continued to work on my project.  Now, I can't work in that workspace unless I run Eclipse IDE with \"Run As Administrator\" which I would prefer not to do. Any suggestions on fixing this?\n\nA:\n\nEdit access rights of the workspace dir and give full access right to your user.\n\n"
