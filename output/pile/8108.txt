The reason that there is too much\nmoney chasing too few deals is that the money is 'stuck' in certain places\n(SF, NY, Boston, Austin). The assumption is that if you want to play the VC\ngame, you go where the money is. But not all good opportunities are in those\nlocations or are capable of moving there. And that is why we have mad\ninflation in the money centers, while the rest of the country is living with\ndeflation.\n\nI'm waiting for the next wave of VCs to figure out how to overcome this\ngeographic limitation and grab those opportunities which are currently being\nignored.\n\n"
