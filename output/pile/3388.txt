    "text": "Modeling the time-intensity profile of solar flare generated particle fluxes in the inner heliosphere.\nIt is possible to model the time-intensity profile of solar particles expected in space after the occurrence of a significant solar flare on the sun. After the particles are accelerated in the flare process, if conditions are favorable, they may be released into the solar corona and then into space. The heliolongitudinal gradients observed in the inner heliosphere are extremely variable, reflecting the major magnetic structures in the solar corona which extend into space. These magnetic structures control the particle gradients in the inner heliosphere. The most extensive solar particle measurements are those observed by earth-orbiting spacecraft, and forecast and prediction procedures are best for the position of the earth. There is no consensus of how to extend the earth-based models to other locations in space. Local interplanetary conditions and structures exert considerable influence on the time-intensity profiles observed. The interplanetary shock may either reduce or enhance the particle intensity observed at a specific point in space and the observed effects are very dependent on energy."
