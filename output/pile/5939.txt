This is not in any way a fan fiction and should not be\nread as such. It is however a gay story of love that also happens\nto involve diaper usage.

I would love to hear from you, but\nplease, as always, no flames, for I do this for myself and no\nothers.**** Billy Bray, a twenty nine year old gay man with a ten\nyear old son, had just made a very large decision with his partner,\nnow both had to go talk to someone. Billy had to go home and talk\nto his son, Bobby. Danny Dee, thirty years old, also gay, and also\nwith a ten year old son named Donnie. He had been dating Billy for\nmore than a year and they loved each other a great deal. The two\nhad met online, they had matching interests. Not only were they\nboth gay, they had both had children when young and stupid and had\nbeen trying their best to prove how straight they were, but they\nwere both diaper lovers as well. Their first in person meeting was\nalmost a year after they had met online and had started talking, so\nthey had known each other for almost two years now, and it had been\na very shy event. Until the time they had met in person, neither\nhad ever admitted to anyone that they were gay in person, nor had\neither ever worn a diaper out of the house or where anyone could\never see them. Both were shy and timid about anyone ever finding\nout about them, but now they Preteen Underage Nymphet were\nabout to make a huge step, they were both about to come out in a\nhuge way, they were about to get married. Now all they had to do\nwas inform their sons, family and all their friends. If only they\nhad known that this was not going to come as too much of a shock to\nalmost all of them. \u201cBobby, could you come here for a minute\nplease, we need to talk?\u201d Billy called out when he made it home. To\nsay he was nervous would be an understatement. He had never\nadmitted to anyone in person that he was gay. \u201cYeah Daddy, what do\nyou need to talk about?\u201d His beautiful young son asked as he came\nscampering in the room. \u201cWe better go sit down, some of this may\ncome as a shock to you.\u201d \u201cWhat Daddy, what's wrong?\u201d He asked\ncautiously, hoping there was nothing wrong with his dad, he loved\nhim a great deal and would not want to live without him. \u201cThere's\nnothing wrong, but, well, I have something to tell you and it might\ncome as a bit of a shock. It's well, it's like this, I'm gay.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, so, I've known for forever that you were, so what.\u201d \u201cReally,\nbut how, I've never told anyone.\u201d \u201cUm, your friend Danny's stayed a\nfew nights just a little too late, and our bedrooms are kinda right\nnext door. I'm not exactly dumb you know.\u201d Bobby grinned. \u201cOh god,\nyou heard us?\u201d \u201cYeah, only a bit though. I've known you were\nprobably gay for a long time though, don't worry. That can't be all\nyou wanted to tell me though is it?\u201d \u201cNo, it isn't. Well, you see,\nwe wanna get married, and since I own the house and Danny doesn't,\nwe want us all to live here.\u201d \u201cOh, that's good. Danny's got a son\nthe same age as me though, doesn't he. Why haven't we ever met by\nthe way?\u201d \u201cYeah, he does and it just never came up to have you boys\nmeet, not sure why.\u201d \u201cOh no, we only have two bedrooms, that means\nwe'll have to share a bedroom though, what'll he think about me\nwetting the bed and still wearing diapers?\u201d Bobby gasped. \u201cHe'll be\nfine with it, just explain to him and I'm sure he'll be good. I\nthink Danny said once that Donnie wet the bed too, maybe he still\ndoes and he wears diapers as well.\u201d \u201cWhen are you guys getting\nmarried then, and where?\u201d \u201cWe were thinking end of the month,\nsummer just started so it'll be nice, and we're just gonna do it\nhere, since we have a nice back yard.\u201d \u201cHave you admitted it to\nanyone else though, or am I the first you told?\u201d \u201cYou're the\nfirst.\u201d \u201cYou know Grandma and Grandpa aren't gonna be shocked\neither right?\u201d \u201cHow do you know?\u201d \u201cThe week I spent there a few\nmonths ago, they asked me about your friend Danny, and I said you\nwere really good friends. They asked if he spent the night, but I\ntold them no, because technically he hasn't, so I think they know.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Was about all Billy could come up with. \u201cHow are you gonna\ntell everyone?\u201d \u201cI was thinking of having the family over for\ndinner tomorrow night and letting them know.\u201d \u201cAnd when are Danny\nand his son moving in?\u201d \u201cHe's gonna give notice tomorrow that he's\nmoving, and then they'll probably move in in about a week or two.\u201d\n\u201cOkay. Well at least my bedroom's really big, so I guess we'll fit\neasily enough.\u201d \u201cThanks Bobby, I'm so glad you're a nice boy.\u201d\nBilly said, hugging his beautiful son close to him. Meanwhile on\nthe opposite side of town, Danny had just arrived home to talk to\nhis son Donnie. \u201cHey Preteen Underage Nymphet Donnie, we\nneed to talk, come sit down with me please?\u201d He asked softly as\nsoon as he walked in and found Donnie sitting on the floor watching\nTV. \u201cOkay.\u201d He said and went and joined his dad on the couch,\nturning off the TV as he went. \u201cSo, what's up Daddy?\u201d \u201cWhat I'm\nabout to tell you may come as a bit of a shock to you, but please\nlet me finish before you say anything? This is hard enough as it\nis.\u201d \u201cOkay.\u201d \u201cThanks. Well, here goes. I'm gay and I have a\nboyfriend. We love each other a great deal and want to get married\nand move in with each other. This is only a rental place and is too\nsmall for four people to live, but his house is much bigger, yet\nonly has two bedrooms and has a huge yard. He owns the house, has a\nten year old son just like you, and you boys will have to share a\nbedroom. You're the first person I've ever told in real life that\nI'm gay, and this is really hard.\u201d He rushed out all in one breath\nnearly. \u201cOkay, except, well what about my bed wetting, we have to\nshare a bedroom, how am I gonna hide that?\u201d \u201cAll that I told you\nand that's all you wanna know about?\u201d Danny asked incredulously.\n\u201cWell yeah. I've known you were gay for a long time, I don't care\nabout that, and I knew you were dating a man, that's fine. I'm not\nstupid you know. But how am I gonna hide wetting the bed when\nthere's someone in the same room as me?\u201d \u201cI think his son still\nwets the bed too, so you might be fine. If he doesn't, you'll just\nhave to explain it to him, don't worry, I wouldn't let him make fun\nof you.\u201d \u201cOkay. So, I'm the first person you've ever told?\u201d \u201cYeah,\nand I'm scared shitless of telling your grandparents.\u201d \u201cI bet they\nalready know. You remember that week I spent with them a few months\nago when you had to go away, well they asked me when your last date\nwas, and I said that you'd never gone on a date that I knew of.\nThey just nodded their heads and went on with business as usual, so\nI'm pretty sure they know. Where did you go that week anyway, you\nnever said, just said it was business?\u201d \u201cMy boyfriend and I went\naway together for the week, we went to a small gay oriented resort\nin Holland, it was a really nice trip where we could be ourselves\naround other people.\u201d \u201cI thought you said you'd never told anyone\nbefore?\u201d \u201cWell, I haven't. At least no one I knew, and even there,\nit was never said, it was just the way it was there, no one had to\nask.\u201d He blushed. \u201cOh. I know they have a lot of nudist resorts\nthere, was that one of them?\u201d \u201cNo, and how would you know that?\u201d\n\u201cBecause one of my friends at school is from there and he said\nthere are more nude beaches and resorts there than there are non\nnude. It was funny, I asked him if he went to the nude ones, and he\nsaid all his life, and now when he went swimming here, he wanted to\nswim naked, but he's not allowed and he doesn't like it.\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d\nDanny laughed. \u201cSo, you're finally getting married then. When and\nwhere?\u201d \u201cEnd of the month we're hoping, and it'll be in the back\nyard of our new house.\u201d \u201cWhen are we moving, and when do you plan\nto tell the family?\u201d \u201cProbably in a few days.\u201d \u201cTo both.\u201d \u201cYeah.\nHaven't figured out how I'm gonna do it yet, but considering I want\nall the family there at the wedding and most of my friends too, I\nguess I should tell them before they find out at the wedding.\u201d\n\u201cThat might be funny actually. So, which one of you wears the dress\nthen?\u201d Donny giggled. \u201cOh shut up.\u201d Danny laughed and smacked his\nbrat. \u201cActually, I wasn't really kidding, is one of you more girly,\n'cause I don't really think you are, so will one of you be wearing\na dress?\u201d \u201cNo, neither of us are like that and we'll both wear\nsuits.\u201d \u201cOkay. How big is the house then, how are four people gonna\nlive in a two bedroom house?\u201d \u201cIt's a pretty good sized rancher\nactually, the bedrooms are really big, at least the master bedroom\nis, and it looks like Bobby's bedroom might be too from what I've\nseen of it.\u201d \u201cOh, that's good I guess. So, when do I meet them then\nand why didn't you guys let us boys meet before?\u201d \u201cNever came up, I\njust always went to his house or we went out.\u201d \u201cOh, so you know\nBobby then was it?\u201d \u201cSorta, not a lot though. I kinda was always\nthere either just before he went to bed or right after, so we never\ntalked a lot.\u201d \u201cOh. So he knew you guys were gay Preteen\nUnderage Nymphet then!\u201d \u201cNo, Billy never told him.\u201d \u201cI\nguarantee he knows though.\u201d \u201cProbably not.\u201d \u201cI knew and you weren't\ncoming here for fun.\u201d Donnie pointed out. \u201cTrue.\u201d \u201cSo, when do I\nmeet them then, and are they nice?\u201d \u201cOh right. We could try and\nmeet tomorrow maybe and Billy's super nice and from what I know of\nBobby, so is he.\u201d \u201cThat's good.\u201d That night after the boys went to\nbed, the men talked to each other on the phone for a good half an\nhour, telling how the first telling had went, and they both had to\nlaugh that both their sons already knew. Both admitted though that\nit was a good thing that they had been wearing diapers at the time,\nbecause they were so nervous they had wet a lot. They agreed that\nthe next morning they would have to get together and let the boys\nmeet and have everyone get to know each other, so that was all set.\nBilly also called his parents, sisters and brother, and asked them\nto dinner the following night, and they all agreed, saying it\nsounded nice. Danny and Donnie were on their way to Billy and\nBobby's house the next morning, it was all the way across town, so\nit was a long drive, and on the way there, they talked some. \u201cI'm\nsorta nervous Daddy, what if they Preteen Underage Nymphet\ndon't like me, what'll happen then?\u201d Donnie admitted. \u201cThey'll love\nyou Baby, don't worry so much. You're smart, good looking, kind and\ncaring, what's not to like!\u201d \u201cYeah, like all the bullies at school\nlike me. They hate me for all those reasons, what if Bobby's the\nsame as they are?\u201d \u201cHe's not, and from what little I know, he has\nthe same problems at school.\u201d \u201cOh, that's good at least I guess.\u201d\nThey talked lots more, but said nothing much. Almost the exact same\nconversation was being had by Billy and Bobby though, Bobby was\njust as nervous. Finally Danny and Donnie made it and went up to\nthe door and knocked and were let in moments later. It was funny at\nfirst when the two boys were introduced, they were both shy and\nawkward, shook each others hands and stuttered a hello. Both men\nnoticed something right away, the boys liked what they saw, and\nwhile both men wondered about the sexuality of their sons, neither\nwas certain if the boys were going to turn out gay as well, though\nthey did have their suspicions. The next couple hours went by with\nthe four of them sitting on the couch and chairs getting to know\neach other. They all talked a lot, but nothing of great importance\nwas really said. The boys did warm up a bit and did not seem quite\nso shy, but still they hardly talked and the adults had to push\nthem into the conversation at times. All in all though it was a\ngood first meeting, and as soon as Danny and Donnie left, Billy and\nBobby started making dinner for the family. They made a nice big\ndinner and the family arrived, greetings were passed around and\nsmall talk was made. Dinner was served Preteen Underage\nNymphet and they all ate happily. Finally dinner and desert\nwere done with, and Billy stood up and got everyone's attention. \u201cI\nhave an announcement to make.\u201d He said clearly. The entire place\nwent silent, not that there were that many people there mind you.\n\u201cThis may come as a surprise to everyone, but I'm getting married.\u201d\n\u201cReally, to who?\u201d His mom asked. \u201cNow there's the part that may or\nmay not surprise everyone. His name's Danny, we're getting married\nat the end of the month. We've been dating for about a year now and\nhave known each other for about two. So, in case you missed it, I'm\ngay, I'm happy, I'm proud, and I'm getting married to a very nice\nman.\u201d \u201cCongratulations.\u201d Everyone said happily. The news that he\nwas gay came as no real surprise to his family, that he would get\nmarried though had, until of course he said it was to a man. They\nall talked and talked after that, everyone offering what help they\ncould give for the upcoming wedding preparations. Of course\neveryone asked when they were going to get to meet the lucky guy\nand his son, because Billy told them all about him having a son as\nwell, that in fact they were much alike in that way. All in all, it\nwas a very good evening, and by the end of it, they felt that the\nwedding was going to be a piece of cake, hell, even that was going\nto be taken care of by his mom, who happened to be a cake\ndecorator. The next day Danny went and talked to all his family, he\nhad Donnie with him of course, and told them all that he was gay\nand getting married, they too were not all that surprised by the\nnews that he was gay, and laughed when he said he was getting\nmarried, that is until he too explained that he was marrying a man.\nThey too all offered their help in preparing for the wedding, so\nthat was good. Both nights the men talked to each other and told of\ntheir outing to their families, and they both laughed, saying that\nin the end, it was a great deal easier than they had ever imagined\nit would be, and that they had all been more surprised to hear they\nwere getting married. Danny gave his notice to his landlord and\ntold him that he was moving out on the fifteenth of the month, or\nbefore, because he may as well, and he was good with that. Danny\nand Donnie went and grabbed a bunch of boxes and started packing\ntheir things that very night and within a few days, they were ready\nto go. Since they lived in a furnished apartment, the chore was\nsurprisingly fast and easy, so before too long, they were pretty\nmuch ready to go. Danny called up Billy and asked if they were\nready for them to move in, and of course Billy said yes. Billy and\nBobby excitedly went and helped the two to bring all their\nbelongings from the old house to their new house, and then helped\nto get everything put away. Still the boys were both nervous as to\nwhat was to happen at bed time. Neither had admitted to the other\nthat they were bed wetters. That point was fast approaching though,\nthey had worked long and hard all day long getting the two new\noccupants of the house all settled in, and it was nearing bed time\nfor both the tired boys. \u201cOkay boys, time for bed. Go on up, and I\nthink you both need to have a talk before you do, but do so in\nprivate.\u201d Billy said after catching Danny's eye, pretty much\ntelling him what he was going to do. They had of course talked it\nover and agreed that the boys had to do this themselves. \u201cOkay,\ngoodnight, love you.\u201d They both said to their dads, both Preteen Underage Nymphet\ngiving hugs and kisses goodnight. \u201cGoodnight, love you too.\u201d Both\nmen said to their boys. The boys trudged to the bedroom, both not\nwanting to do what they knew they had to do, both were scared and\nnervous. Finally they made it to their bedroom and they each sat on\ntheir own bed, facing each other. They both tried to start, a\ncouple times each, but finally it was Bobby that had worked up the\ncourage to do it first. \u201cI wet the bed and wear diapers.\u201d He\nblurted out all in one fast breath. \u201cReally, I do too!\u201d \u201cReally,\nthat's awesome, then there's no problems. What kinda diapers do you\nwear?\u201d \u201cThey're a tape on ultra absorbency, how about you? My dad\ntried me on the Goodnites, but they always leaked.\u201d \u201cSame here\nactually. Do you still like your dad to change you?\u201d \u201cSometimes,\nbut most of the time no.\u201d \u201cSame here. Is it for the same reason as\nI don't like him to change me much anymore?\u201d \u201cProbably. You get\nhard too huh?\u201d \u201cYeah, like super hard. He just laughs at his hard\nlittle baby and tells me to think about the nastiest, ugliest girl\nI can, that usually does it too.\u201d \u201cSame here.\u201d Donnie giggled. \u201cYou\nwanna change each other?\u201d Bobby blushed. \u201cI think I'd like that.\u201d\n\u201cMe too. Do you think you're gay?\u201d Bobby blushed. \u201cYeah, how about\nyou?\u201d \u201cYeah. Sometimes when your dad came over for the evening, I\nlistened to them having sex and I dreamed it was me in there\ninstead. I don't wanna have sex with my dad, but you know, I was\njust so hard. Do you jack off?\u201d \u201cOh yeah, all the time. You really\nheard them?\u201d \u201cThey tried to stay quiet, but I could still hear them\nsometimes.\u201d \u201cMan, I'd love to hear them. You think they'll do it\ntonight?\u201d \u201cHard to say.\u201d \u201cSpeaking of hard, are you as hard as I am\nright now?\u201d \u201cProbably. How long have you been jacking off?\u201d \u201cDon't\nknow. I sorta always played with it, Daddy was forever telling me\nto play with myself in private, but it's been about a year since I\nreally starting jacking off 'til the good feelings.\u201d \u201cCumming you\nmean?\u201d \u201cYeah, I guess so, but I don't make cum. Daddy says that'll\ncome along when I'm about thirteen probably.\u201d \u201cDoesn't matter if\nyou produce it or not, my dad says it's still cumming.\u201d \u201cOh. You\nreally talk to your dad about that?\u201d \u201cOh yeah, he and I can talk\nabout anything. I don't know why he thought he could hide that he\nwas gay from me, because I've known since I was five. Mind you, I\nhaven't told him yet either. Wanna diaper each other now then?\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Donnie smiled. Bobby went and got two of his diapers, since\nhe knew where they were, and then went back to the bed. He pulled\nDonnie up to a standing position and started to undress him,\nstopping once Donnie was standing there in a very hot looking pair\nof very tight fitting boxer briefs. Donnie then repaid the favor\nuntil Bobby was standing there in an equally hot and tight pair of\nbikini briefs. \u201cMy god you're hot.\u201d They both said at the same time\nonce they stopped staring and drooling at each other, it took a few\nminutes. Bobby pushed Donnie onto the bed on his back and grabbed\nthe diaper and got it ready. He then did something that he had\nwanted to do for a very long time, pull down another boys underwear\nand see what he was hiding. He had never got the chance to see\nanother boy naked before, and now he was not only going to get the\nchance, but the boy he was about to see was exceptionally hard, the\ntruth of that was pulsing madly already under the thin fabric,\ndoing little to hide the fact that he was a very hard and happy\nlittle boy. Bobby gasped when he pulled the fabric back and exposed\nthe boy who was soon going to be his brother, it was even better\nthan he imagined it would be. Donnie was so hard, his foreskin was\npulled all the way back in his hardness in fact, and his erection\nwas pulsing away like crazy. Bobby found himself having to lick his\nlips, a lot, because his mouth was suddenly very dry. He finally\nmanaged to pulled Donnie's underwear all the way off and then\nslipped the diaper underneath his very nice bum. He grabbed his\ncream and opened it up, and then scooped some out and applied it to\nDonnie. The first touch was too much, for both boys actually,\nbecause they both came, and came hard. They were both dry of\ncourse, but they sure did cum. \u201cWow.\u201d They both said at the same\ntime almost ten minutes later. Bobby had even slumped onto the\nfloor. Donnie was still just as hard as he was before,\nPreteen Underage Nymphet and with no further\nwords, Bobby got up and finished creaming his new brother, and then\nwiped his hand off on the inside of the diaper and then taped\nDonnie up. They traded places and Donnie finally Preteen\nUnderage Nymphet got the chance to see another boy naked and\nhard. He too had longed to see just what he was about to reveal,\nand when he did finally see it, he too gasped. He pulled off\nBobby's underwear and slipped the diaper under his fine little bum\nand grabbed the cream. This time they did not cum at the very first\ntouch, but Donnie wanted Bobby to cum, so he was rubbing just a bit\nmore than was strictly needed. Granted, it did not take much, and\nas soon as Bobby went off, so did Donnie. They both slumped down\nfor even longer this time and then both said wow once again once\nthey came down. Donnie completed the diapering of Bobby right away,\nand then they were both done. \u201cWanna crawl into bed with me so that\nwe can talk a bit before we go to sleep?\u201d Bobby asked. \u201cOkay.\u201d They\nboth crawled into the bed and pulled the blankets up. \u201cSo, how long\nhave you thought you were gay then?\u201d Bobby asked. \u201cDon't know, just\nsorta always I guess. I've always preferred hanging around boys and\nlooking at boys more than girls. I have some girl friends, but not\nmany. How about you?\u201d \u201cSame really. How about diapers, do you like\nwearing them too?\u201d \u201cYeah, you do too?\u201d \u201cYeah, truth be told, I\nprobably stopped wetting the bed when I was six or so, but Dad\nnever made me try or give up my diapers, so I never did. How about\nyou?\u201d \u201cAbout the same actually.\u201d He giggled. \u201cCool, do you ever\nwear them during the day when no one's home?\u201d \u201cYeah, all the time,\nor at least as much as I can. Dad even asked me once why I was\ngoing through so many diapers, and I just shrugged and said, don't\nknow. He never said anything more, but I think he suspects\nsomething.\u201d \u201cYeah, my dad asked me the same thing, I think he\nsuspects something as well.\u201d \u201cWhat does your dad do with you while\nhe's at work during the summer?\u201d \u201cThis year he said I can stay home\nby myself, because I'm really good and he doesn't wanna haveta pay\nfor someone to watch me anymore.\u201d \u201cSame, so I guess we can watch\neach other. They both work tomorrow, wanna wear only our diapers\nall day 'til they get home?\u201d \u201cSure, that'd be awesome. I've never\ngotten to wear diapers with someone else before.\u201d \u201cMe neither.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I suppose we should probably get to sleep, but before we do,\nhave you ever kissed anyone before?\u201d \u201cNo, have you?\u201d \u201cNo, would you\nlike to?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d So they reached into each other and pressed their\nlips together and kissed tenderly for a few moments. As soon as the\nkiss broke, they both sighed contentedly, said Preteen Underage\nNymphet goodnight to each other, and then Bobby shut off the light\nand they curled up and went to sleep. Danny and Billy stayed up for\na while watching TV, until they knew the boys were going to be\nasleep, and then they too went to bed. They changed each others\nsoggy diapers and took care of each others needs as they did so,\nand then laid down and talked for a bit. \u201cSo, how do you think the\nboys' talk went?\u201d Billy asked. \u201cProbably really good. Wonder how\nlong it'll take them to become boyfriends?\u201d \u201cProbably by the end of\nthe week, and I'm willing to bet that they diapered each other and\nplayed a little as well. I know Bobby's getting the urge a lot more\nfrequently, he hardly lets me diaper him any more because he's\nalways so hard, that and I think he likes to jack off into his\ndiaper. Can't say's I blame him any for that mind you.\u201d \u201cYeah,\nDonnie's been pretty much the same, they'll sure make a cute little\ncouple. You think Bobby's a diaper lover, because I'm pretty sure\nDonnie is?\u201d \u201cYeah, I'm reasonably certain he officially stopped\nwetting the bed a few years ago, and I know he uses his diapers\nduring the day some, whenever he can, because he goes through them\nfaster than he should be.\u201d \u201cYeah, same with Donnie. I'm happy for\nthem and I sorta wish I had've gotten what they get now when I was\na kid, I would've been far happier and not felt so alone. At least\nthe boys have understanding dads they can talk to. Should we let\nthem know we know they're diaper lovers, or let them know that so\nare we?\u201d \u201cNot yet, let's hold off and let them make the decision on\ntheir own fully as to how far they take it. Within a couple weeks\nwe'll know by how many diapers they've used whether or not they\nreally and truly are.\u201d \u201cGood point, and with both of Preteen Underage Nymphet us\nbeing at work and letting the boys stay home by themselves, they'll\ndefinitely get lots of opportunity to wear their diapers as much as\nthey care to, should they care to, which I bet they do.\u201d \u201cI\nwouldn't bet against you, that's for sure.\u201d \u201cWell my love, should\nwe get to sleep?\u201d \u201cYes, I think we should.\u201d Billy said and they\nkissed goodnight and went to sleep themselves. Chapter 2 They all\nslept well through the night. Their first ever real sleepover, and\nthey all enjoyed it, getting to cuddle up to someone, though the\nmen did get to enjoy one weeks worth, but now this was permanent\nand they were no longer hiding. The men woke up in time to get\nready for work, just letting the boys sleep until they were ready\nto get up. The boys at least got to relax for the summer break, but\nboth men had to Preteen Underage Nymphet go to work. They\ngot up, had their shower, together of course, then diapered and\ndressed each other and then went and had some coffee and breakfast.\nJust before it was time for them to leave, they both headed to the\nboys' bedroom to let them know they were leaving. As they entered\nthe room, they noticed that the boys were sleeping together in the\nsame bed, and they were all cuddled up, it was very cute. \u201cAw,\nisn't that adorable. The little baby boys had their first\nsleepover.\u201d Billy cooed. \u201cYeah, wonder if maybe we're just gonna\nhave to replace the two twin beds for one queen bed, but we'll wait\nfor that.\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d Danny went and shook the boys' shoulders to wake\nthem up enough so that they could say goodbye, and within a couple\nminutes, both boys were awake. \u201cOh, mornin' Daddy.\u201d They both\ngrumbled out. \u201cMorning Boys.\u201d Both men said. \u201cWe have to be heading\nto work now boys, so we wanted to say goodbye and to tell you to\nbehave yourselves today.\u201d Billy said. \u201cOkay Daddy, you guys have a\ngood day at work and we'll behave.\u201d \u201cI know you will, because I'm\nsure you both know the repercussions should you misbehave, and I'm\nwilling to bet neither of you wants that. You both know our numbers\nat work, so call if you need anything or anything comes up you\ncan't handle.\u201d \u201cOkay.\u201d Both boys said. \u201cLove you.\u201d All Preteen\nUnderage Nymphet of them said together. The men left and made\ntheir way to work, while the boys stayed cuddled up in their warm\nand cozy bed, cuddled up to each other as they had been all night\nlong. They stayed like that for quite a while, just luxuriating in\nthe warmth of both the bed and the cuddles. Finally it was Bobby\nthat broke the silence. \u201cSo, you think they know? They had to have\nnoticed how we were sleeping together and all cuddled up together\nall night long.\u201d \u201cThey know, but how much you wanna bet they say\nnothing and just pretend as if nothing's out of place and let us go\nto them with it. By the way, I wanna ask if we can get a bigger bed\nand just have the one, I liked sleeping with you, I've never slept\nso well in my life.\u201d \u201cSame here, and I bet you're right too.\u201d\n\u201cShould we get our soggy baby bums outta bed and go get some\nbreakfast?\u201d \u201cSure. Are you as soggy as I am?\u201d \u201cI don't know, why\ndon't you check?\u201d Donnie grinned. \u201cOkay.\u201d Bobby said brightly, so\nthey both checked the others diaper, and sure enough, they both\nfelt each others hardness alright. \u201cOh yeah, you're just as wet as\nme, and just as hard too. I like to rub myself through my wet\ndiapers in the morning, how about you?\u201d \u201cFor sure, wanna kiss and\nrub each other?\u201d \u201cOh yeah.\u201d Donnie said huskily, and they both\nrolled and attached their lips, and then started kissing and\nrubbing at the same time. For the next several minutes they kept\nthis up, they Preteen Underage Nymphet were both enjoying it\nso much. Never before had jacking off felt so good, neither ever\nwanted this to end. So, on that note, when they came, they\ncontinued right on stroking and kissing, and even after their\nsecond amazing orgasms, they still continued going. It was not\nuntil after their fourth orgasms that they were satisfied, in fact\nboth boys were now soft inside their diapers. They sighed deeply\nand rolled apart, both laying on their backs, staring at the\nceiling as they came down from such a massive experience. \u201cWow,\nthat was incredible.\u201d Donnie was the first to break the silence\nthis time. \u201cI'll say. I've dreamed of doing that for so long, but\nthat was way better than I ever imagined it could be.\u201d \u201cSame here.\nShould we get up and go get breakfast, I'm getting really hungry\nnow?\u201d \u201cYeah, but we should probably change each other first.\u201d\n\u201cYou're right. Hey, wanna try something I've read about but never\nhad the chance to try?\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cDouble diapering.\u201d \u201cI've never\ntried it either, but I've read about it too and I'd definitely try\nthat with you.\u201d Bobby said happily. \u201cWicked, I'll get everything\nthen.\u201d Donnie hopped out of bed and went and grabbed two fresh\ndiapers, and then searched around for something that was sharp\nenough to poke holes in their diapers. He found a pair of nail\nclippers on top of the Preteen Underage Nymphet\ndresser, and it had a nail file with a point on it, so that would\ndo just fine. He grinned to Bobby as soon as he found what he was\nlooking for, then headed back to the Preteen Underage Nymphet bed.\nBy the time he made it there, Bobby was already in diaper change\nposition, so Donnie got him ready first. He poked lots of holes in\nBobby's diaper and then slipped the new diaper underneath him and\nthen taped it up nice and snug. They then traded places and Bobby\nrepaid the favor. \u201cWow, this is totally awesome.\u201d Donnie said\nhappily once he was done. \u201cDefinitely. Let's try not to change each\nother 'til just before our dads are about to get home, and then we\ncan get dressed as well. Have you ever worn a diaper under your\nclothes in front of your dad before?\u201d \u201cOkay that sounds great, and\nI bet these last 'til then too. Yeah, I have a few times, but I\ntried to stay sitting as much as possible or out of his sight as\nmuch as I could, and I'm sure I blushed a bit too. How about you?\u201d\n\u201cSame here. Wanna do it tonight though, change each others diapers\nand then get dressed just before they get home?\u201d \u201cOkay.\u201d Donnie\nsaid brightly. They headed to the kitchen and made and ate some\nbreakfast, then headed to the living room to lay back and watch\nsome cartoons. They did that for a couple hours until they were\nbored of that. \u201cSo, what should we do now?\u201d Donnie asked. \u201cWanna\nplay some games?\u201d \u201cSure, why not.\u201d They set up the game that they\nwanted to play and sat back and played that for the next couple\nhours, until they once again got bored, as well as hungry. They\nwent to the kitchen and made and ate some lunch, and as they were\neating, they talked, not that they had not been the entire time\nthey were playing their games mind you. \u201cSo, what's your last name\nanyway Bobby?\u201d \u201cBray, how about yours?\u201d \u201cDee. Wonder how our dads\nare gonna put their names after they're married and if we'll be\nasked to take the same name? Oh wait, Bray and Dee, that's too\nfunny, we could be called Bray-Dee, or Brady, as in the Brady\nBunch, that'd be so hilarious, and it sorta fits too.\u201d Donnie\ngiggled. \u201cHuh, no idea what you're talking about here.\u201d Bobby said\nin confusion. \u201cOh right, I forget that most kids probably don't\nwatch old sitcom reruns. It's a really old show from back in the\nseventies that shows on some of the retro TV channels. It's about\ntwo families that come together and their name was Brady. We're the\nsame, two families that came together, albeit quite different as\nwell, but the same and funny none the less.\u201d \u201cOh. It sorta makes\nsense though for them to combine our last names somehow, and that\nsorta does make sense. I've never even heard of the show though, so\nthe comedy of it does sorta escape me, But Bray-Dee does sound\ngood.\u201d Bobby chuckled. \u201cAnd actually, now that I think of it,\nwhat's even funnier is that in the show, there's a Bobby Brady as\nwell.\u201d \u201cOh, is that a good or a bad thing?\u201d He had to ask. \u201cGood,\nor at least I can't come up with any reason why it wouldn't be.\u201d\nDonnie shrugged. \u201cOkay then, so Bray-Dee is what we suggest to our\ndads if they haven't already thought it over.\u201d \u201cCool, we'll be the\nnew Brady Bunch then.\u201d Donnie giggled. \u201cSo, how shocked were you to\nfind out your dad was getting married anyway?\u201d \u201cI probably should\nhave been wearing a diaper, I nearly peed myself in shock, and my\nunderwear were a little wet after, but I had to clamp it down hard\nto not fully wet. I'd known my dad was gay for a long time, even\nthough he never admitted it to anyone 'til the day he told me, so\nhim telling me he was getting married was more than a little\nshocking. Then he told me who to and I was relieved. To tell you\nthe truth, I would've fought him had he told me he was getting\nmarried to a woman, I didn't Preteen Underage Nymphet\nwant any female around to ruin things for us, but another guy, now\nthat's a different story. It's even better that I get such a cool\nbrother out of the deal.\u201d \u201cCool, hardly. I get teased and taunted\nand very nearly bullied at school, I'm so far from being cool it's\nnot even funny. I'm more a nerd than anything, and the dorks at\nschool take great pride in reminding me daily. Granted, they also\ntaunt me for wetting my pants, even though I haven't peed at school\nsince I was in grade two, but kids never forget anything.\u201d \u201cThat's\nfunny, because I'm the exact same, except my last accident at\nschool was grade three. So how'd you take your dad telling you he\nwas getting married?\u201d \u201cActually, almost the exact same as you. Like\nyou, I had no idea what I would've done had he actually brought\nPreteen Underage Nymphet home a female, not that I thought he\nwould, because I've known he was gay as well for a long time. When\nhe said it was a guy and that he and his son were moving in with\nus, I was happy. That is until I realized that we only have two\nbedrooms, which meant that you'd have to share with me, but what\nabout my bed wetting. I figured you'd probably be just another\nbully and I'd end up getting it at home too, only now there'd be no\nway to hide that I wore diapers to bed. At least at school no one\nknows I wear diapers to bed, though they've still said it anyway.\nDad told me not to worry about it though, said that he thought you\nmight still wet too, but I'm sure he knew you did.\u201d \u201cYeah, pretty\nmuch the exact same things went through my mind as well and my dad\nsaid the same thing to me too, so they both knew fully, but they\nmade us tell each other instead. I suppose it was probably the best\nway to handle it, and it worked out for the best. By the way, how\nwet is your outer diaper, can you even tell yet?\u201d \u201cIt's getting\nwet, but not too bad. As for our dads, yeah, I think they did it on\npurpose too, to make us tell each other, and I think it worked out\nfor the best too.\u201d Bobby smiled. \u201cSame here. So, what do you think\nour dads thought of finding us sleeping together?\u201d \u201cWho knows, but\nI'm betting they know, but I'm also willing to bet they never say\nanything to us at all about it.\u201d \u201cI bet you're right, but we'll\ntell them soon anyway and maybe ask for a bigger bed so that it's\nmore comfortable.\u201d \u201cYeah, that'd be nice. At least we're not too\nbig for the bed yet.\u201d Bobby said. As soon as they finished lunch,\nthey went and sat back down in the living room for the rest of the\nafternoon and either watched TV or played video games. They did in\nfact manage to catch an episode of The Brady Bunch though and Bobby\nhad to admit it was pretty funny. Just before the Dads were to get\nhome, the boys decided that they had better go change their soggy\ndiapers, so headed to their bedroom to do so. \u201cSo, we gonna still\nchange each other into fresh diapers?\u201d Bobby asked once they made\nit there. \u201cI'm game if you are.\u201d Donnie grinned. \u201cCool.\u201d He grinned\nand went and grabbed two diapers. Bobby went to the bed with the\ndiapers and Donnie was already laying down in diaper change\nposition. He was now very clearly very wet on his outer diaper.\nBobby removed the first and then the second diapers and balled and\ntaped them up, then used a wipe to clean up Donnie, who was\nextremely hard of course, and then put a fresh diaper underneath\nhim and applied a good coating of cream. Bobby did not play though,\nhe wanted to wait until both of them were freshly diapered, and\nthen he wanted to kiss and rub again, so on that, he taped Donnie\nup nice and snug. They then traded places and Donnie changed Bobby\nthe same way. \u201cAh, much better. I so love getting into a nice fresh\ndiaper so that I can pee it.\u201d Bobby sighed. He then pulled Donnie\ndown onto the bed, and once they were there, they attached\nthemselves at the lips and kissed once more, and for their first\ntime, introduced their tongues to each other. In fact, at the exact\nsame time that they started petting each others little diaper\nmonsters. They moaned deeply into each other and then a few seconds\nlater had their first orgasm. They continued right on going though\nand had two more in rapid succession before they were once again\nsatisfied. \u201cMmm, that was so nice, thanks, but now I think we\nshould get dressed.\u201d Bobby pulled away and sighed. \u201cMmmhmm, I guess\nwe should, and then we should go make some dinner.\u201d \u201cProbably\nshould.\u201d Bobby sighed once again. They got up and dressed each\nother, both of them putting the other into sweat pants that were a\nbit too big and a longer tee shirt. Once they were dressed, they\nheaded to the kitchen to start making something for dinner. Neither\nboy was all that much of a cook yet, but they each knew a bit.\nShortly after starting, the dads arrived. \u201cHi Boys, oh, you started\ndinner already, thanks.\u201d Billy said first. \u201cHi Daddy.\u201d Both boys\nsaid and hugged their dads. \u201cYou boys didn't have to start making\ndinner, we would've gotten that.\u201d Danny said. \u201cWe know, but we\nfigured we may as well, you guys worked all day. So, how'd all your\nfriends at work take you guys getting married, or did you tell them\ntoday?\u201d Donnie asked. \u201cThere was only one person there who was\nshocked, and we don't consider him a friend anyway, he's the local\ngay hater. The rest congratulated us and had said they had wondered\nwhen we would get together. A couple of the guys there asked me if\nthat's why I got Danny the job there in the first place, and I had\nto admit that yes, I had wanted my boyfriend working there with me.\nThey laughed and said thought so.\u201d \u201cYeah, but it's a great place to\nwork too and it's been a great year since I started there.\u201d Danny\nsmiled. \u201cYou think you're gonna have troubles with that one guy?\u201d\nDonnie asked curiously. \u201cProbably not. The company has a strict no\nharassment policy in place and should he cause us any problems, he\ncould get himself fired. We may have to put up with the occasional\nicy glare, but whatever. Never liked him anyway, because I knew how\nmuch he hated me, even though he had no idea. I doubt he sticks\naround though, having to work right next to two openly gay men will\nprobably cause him to quit before too long.\u201d Billy said. \u201cI never\nliked him either and I'll be happy to see him go. He's always so\narrogant, and I'm willing to bet he only gets worse.\u201d \u201cWith him\nthough it's far better to smile serenely at him and just agree with\nwhatever he says. No matter what he's going on about, if you do\nthat to him, it totally disarms him and he stops talking. When he\ngets overbearing like that, that's all I do, and he usually takes a\nhike pretty quickly. He's very confrontational and likes to pick\nfights, but he has no idea how to handle politeness or niceties.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I've noticed that too, and I've seen you and a couple of the\nothers do that to him, it's quite funny. He's never even attempted\nto start a conversation with me though, nor I he, so I've never had\nthe opportunity to really find out. Hearing him though was usually\nmore than enough.\u201d Danny laughed. \u201cYou're lucky actually. So, what\nare you boys cooking anyway?\u201d Billy asked. \u201cJust some chicken and\nrice. We can have salad with it I think, but we haven't started\nthat yet.\u201d Donnie said. \u201cOkay, we'll get that ready then.\u201d \u201cYou\ndon't have to, we will.\u201d Bobby said. \u201cWe know, but we'll do it.\u201d\nDanny said. The men got a good salad prepared and then shortly\nthereafter, they all sat down to eat. As they ate, they all talked\nabout their day, and the boys told the men about their conversation\nabout last names. Both men had to laugh, but agreed that joining\nthe names in that way made the most sense. They all talked and\nlaughed all through dinner and then all helped to clean up. Finally\nthey all headed to the living room for the evening, put on a movie\nand watched that, and then watched a bit of TV until it was time\nfor the boys to head to bed. \u201cGoodnight boys, have a good sleep.\u201d\nBoth men said and then gave their sons hugs and kisses goodnight.\nThey headed up to their bedroom and stripped each other. They\ndeemed their diapers good enough for the night, neither of them\nfiguring that they would pee more than their diapers could hold,\nhopefully they were right. When they crawled into bed, they joined\nat the lips once again and rubbed each other through their nice wet\ndiapers until they had cum twice each, and then fell fast asleep.\nMeanwhile the men were still on the couch, and as soon as the boys\nwere out of hearing range for sure, they started talking. \u201cThey\nwere diapered for sure, and they were glowing as well. They're\ndefinitely getting close to each other. When do you figure they'll\ntell us?\u201d Billy laughed. \u201cIf they make it to the weekend I'll be\nsurprised.\u201d Danny chuckled as well. \u201cMe too. I hope they change\ntheir diapers though, they were already starting to show under\ntheir sweats, and I know my little soaker, he'll fill it up fully\nand overflow if he doesn't.\u201d \u201cSame with mine, but oh well if they\ndon't, they'll have to learn that one on their own. Speaking of wet\ndiapers though, mine's getting more than a little soaked as well,\nand well, I could use a nice diaper change, how about you?\u201d \u201cNow\nthat you mention it, yeah, I could.\u201d Bobby smiled brightly and\nturned off the TV. As they went past the bathroom, Bobby decided to\nlook in the diaper pail, since that was where the boys put their\nwet diapers, and sure enough, there were four diapers in it, when\nhe had emptied it the night before, so there should have only been\ntwo in it. Then he noticed something. \u201cPsst, take a look at this.\nThere's four diapers in here, when there should only be two, and\nthere's holes all through two of them. They double diapered each\nother today.\u201d He whispered, so that the boys could not possibly\nhear. \u201cHmm, sounds like a good idea to me actually. We haven't done\nthat to each other since our vacation.\u201d Danny said happily. \u201cOkay.\u201d\nBilly said brightly. So they headed to their bedroom and poked\nholes in each others diapers as soon as they were undressed, and\nthen proceeded to double diaper each other. Once they were ready,\nthey adopted the same position that the boys had used and took care\nof each other twice as well. They too fell asleep soon after,\nactually falling asleep early, even for them. Chapter 3 The\nfollowing morning the men headed to work shortly after waking the\nboys and telling them goodbye. The boys then proceeded to rub a few\ngood orgasms a piece from each other and then double diapered each\nother again. They got dressed this time and went out back and\nplayed for a good portion of the day, stopping only to go in and\nmake and eat lunch. Just before the dads got home, they went in and\nchanged each other once again, jacking off only once this time,\nsingle diapering each other and then dressing each other. The next\nfew days went the exact same, and before they all knew it, it was\nFriday afternoon and the men just got home from work. The boys had\nnot been out of diapers once the entire week and were wetting more\nand more freely, sometimes without hardly realizing they were doing\nit. That night in bed, the boys were talking after their release,\nand they agreed that they had to tell their dads. They decided to\ndo so the following morning. \u201cMorning Daddy.\u201d Both boys said as\nthey entered the kitchen. \u201cMornin Boys.\u201d They both said. \u201cGo ahead\nand get yourself some breakfast boys, then we have to go get some\nstuff done today, we only have a few weeks left to get everything\nfor the wedding to pull this off.\u201d Danny said. \u201cOkay, and we want\nto tell you something as well while we eat.\u201d Donnie said. \u201cOkay.\u201d\nBoth men said, wondering if the boys were going to finally admit to\nthem what they already knew. The men had known of course that the\nboys were playing around, the evidence was all there. Not only\ncould they see it in the boys' faces whenever they looked at them,\nbut they had heard the boys almost every night after their first\ntime, neither was too careful about being quiet. Not only did they\nnot feel it was really necessary, but they could not actually\ncontrol it any anyway. \u201cSo, we decided that we wanted to let you\nguys know a couple things, we're gay, we're boyfriends, and we're\ndiaper lovers. We'd like to go get a new bed today that we can\nsleep in more comfortably, and we'd like to wear our diapers all\nthe time, or at least as much as possible.\u201d Bobby said, just laying\nit all on the line. \u201cOkay, but you have been wearing diapers all\nday every day since Donnie moved in, so what difference does it\nmake?\u201d Billy asked curiously. \u201cFair enough. We wondered if you'd\nnoticed.\u201d \u201cYeah, we did, and you've been double diapering\nyourselves every morning too, but then, so have we a couple times.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I wondered if that wasn't a diaper bulge I saw a few times.\nYour bedroom also always smelled like baby powder. This is so cool.\nSo, why are we all wearing clothes then?\u201d Bobby grinned. \u201cBecause\nyou hadn't been ready to tell us, once you did, then it was safe to\ndo so, but there's no point now, since we have to get going soon.\nAnd yes, we'll get you boys a new bed. So, how far have you gone so\nfar then?\u201d Danny asked. \u201cJust kissing and rubbing so far.\u201d Donnie\nanswered. \u201cThat's nice. We're happy for you boys, and of course, if\nyou have any questions whatsoever, you make sure and come to us,\nokay. We don't want you boys hurting each other when it comes time\nto play with your bums, it's easy to do, and we don't want you to\nlearn the hard way like we both did.\u201d Billy said. \u201cThanks, but\nwe've both read enough and done enough research about it that I\nthink we're covered, but if we have any questions, you know I'd\nask.\u201d Bobby smiled happily. \u201cGood, glad to hear it.\u201d \u201cSo, what all\ndo we have to go buy today then?\u201d Donnie asked. \u201cWell, a new bed\nand more diapers for you boys, because you're getting low, and then\nwe have to go start getting all the supplies and things for the\nwedding. We can't get food yet, but there's lots of things that we\neither need to arrange or buy. To make life a lot easier, we'll be\ndoing buffet style for the food and using paper plates and plastic\nutensils and cups. Yeah, we know, not very classy, but we're not\nvery classy guys, and this will make our lives a hell of a lot\neasier. We'll rent all the catering things for keeping food hot or\ncold, as well as a few things for cooking outside as well, though I\nthink we'll probably buy that. Not sure yet, we'll figure that out\nonce we know the costs on things. We also have to try and figure\nout all the tables and chairs and stuff.\u201d Danny answered. \u201cThat's\ncool, but have you figured out how you're gonna work it out if it\nrains or something stupid like that, and what are you doing for\nmusic?\u201d Bobby asked. \u201cWe're gonna arrange to have a couple large\ntents brought in, they'll help with shade as well, so we can use\nthem either way, and I figured that we have a good stereo system\nand a computer with thousands of songs in it, so we can just do the\nmusic ourselves. We don't wanna spend a huge amount of money, we'd\nrather have a nice trip after.\u201d \u201cOh, okay, but that brings up\nsomething else, where are you going and what's happening with us?\u201d\nDonnie asked. \u201cWe haven't actually decided yet, but we were\nthinking of taking you boys with us and just getting two rooms.\u201d\nBilly answered. \u201cReally!\u201d Both boys said as one. \u201cYeah, we felt you\nboys deserved a nice trip as well, neither of you've ever gotten to\ngo anywhere before, and if we have two rooms, we can still have the\nprivacy we need, and you two can as well.\u201d \u201cWicked, thanks.\u201d They\nboth said again. \u201cYou're welcome, now finish up so that we can get\noutta here and go shopping.\u201d The boys finished up shortly\nthereafter, then they all went and packed their diaper bags and\nheaded out. This was to be the boys' first time leaving the house\nin their diapers and they were both nervous and excited. What if\nanyone noticed, they thought, but then thought better of it. With\nthe clothes they were wearing, you would be hard pressed to\nactually see that they were in fact wearing diapers. Though a\ndiaper lover would see it instantly, and probably, if he was a gay\nman, cum in his pants instantly from it. Both boys were very cute\nafter all. They headed to a furniture place first and went in and\nlooked at a few of the options, the men letting the boys pick out\nthe one they liked, and they finally found one that they both\nliked, the dads both agreed that it was a good choice, so they went\nand paid for it and arranged to have it delivered on Monday. The\nboys were told that it would be their job to disassemble the two\nold beds and have them out of the way, as well as have the room\nready for the new bed when it arrived, and they agreed. From the\nfurniture store, they headed toward a clothing store that the boys\nhad no clue about, and when they got curious enough to ask, they\nwere told that it was a gays only clothing store and that there\nwere clothes there that may help the boys. They were both confused,\nand when they asked what their dads were talking about, they were\ntold to just wait patiently and they would see. Oh, they saw\nalright. When they entered the store, the boys found that while it\nwas geared toward gays, there were clothes of every sort there,\nsome of them probably should not be seen by boys, but the dads were\nnot worried about their little boys seeing anything in there. Not\nonly were there the more regular clothes, of almost every style, as\nwell as some very feminine ones, but there were outfits galore;\nfrom a very skimpy maids outfit to a full leather one that was very\nshiny. There were so many strange and exotic, wild and kinky\noutfits, that not just the men were hard in their diapers looking\nat them, and they enjoyed watching the boys look at them, but the\nboys were painfully hard. Then they came to the section that the\nmen were interested in. \u201cHere's there adult and teen baby wear\nsection. We won't buy you anything from the kinky wear section, not\n'til you're at least twelve, mostly because there isn't a hope in\nhell that any of it'd fit you yet, but we probably shouldn't\neither. Here however they have lots of things that'll fit even you\nboys, but you both need to pick out a few diaper shirts you like,\nand you can feel free to grab anything else that you like as well.\u201d\nPreteen Underage Nymphet Billy said to the boys. Both boys\ntried to say okay, or even thanks, but neither could get their dry\nmouths to say it. Hell neither could barely get their brains to\nthink it, since a good portion of their blood was currently in the\nwrong heads. They did look through the options though and picked\nout several shirts each, as well as they picked out a pair of the\ncutest footed pajamas either of them had ever seen before, and they\neven grabbed a pair of hot looking snap crotch Preteen Underage\nNymphet jean shortalls each. The men almost came from that, and\nthey could not wait to see the boys in them. Neither was interested\nin their boys, or either of them for that matter in a sexual way,\nbut they were diaper lovers, and seeing the boys in only their\ndiapers was always enjoyed, hence the reason neither boy was ever\nencouraged to stop wetting the bed. \u201cAnything else while we're\nhere?\u201d Danny asked once the boys had picked through the entire rack\nand picked out all they wanted. \u201cUm, no, nothing that I can think\nof, at least not from this store.\u201d Donnie stuttered, he was still\nso very hard and hardly able to concentrate. \u201cSounds like you boys\nmaybe need to visit the bathroom, I assure you, it's used a great\ndeal for what you boys need it for right now.\u201d Danny laughed. \u201cNo,\nwe'll wait 'til we get home thanks.\u201d Bobby grinned. \u201cOkay, but what\nelse did you boys want that they wouldn't carry here?\u201d Billy asked.\n\u201cWell, I've always wanted a butt plug, and a dildo would be awesome\nas well.\u201d Bobby said hesitantly, fully expecting an answer of no.\n\u201cOh, sex toys, we should've guessed. We assume that you'd both like\nthem?\u201d Danny laughed. \u201cYeah.\u201d Both boys said. \u201cThere's a separate\nroom, that unfortunately you boys technically aren't allowed in,\nbut they do carry a good selection of those here as well. I'll ask\nthe guy if he'll turn the other way and accidentally not see you\nboys enter that room and we can go pick out a few toys for you.\u201d\nBilly grinned and skipped off. He went and asked the owner,\nexplaining that his son and boyfriend wanted to pick out a couple\ntoys, and he said okay, saying that the boys sure were a cute\nlittle baby couple. Billy had to agree. He went and told the others\nit was a go, none of them had any doubts it would be, the man was\nextremely gay, and both Billy and Danny suspected that the young\nboy that sometimes worked in the store was more than just his\nhelper, and the boy was only just thirteen at best. The men took\nthe boys to the room and went in, and in there the boys nearly came\nin their diapers again. There were shelves upon shelves of all\nsorts of sex toys, some even the boys had no idea what they did or\nwere for. Whenever they looked and saw something and got a puzzled\nlook on their faces, one of the dads would explain it to the boys.\nThey ended up adding a couple extra items in this fashion, because\nthe boys liked the sounds of it. There were several items though\nthat neither boy was interested in at all though. They each ended\nup picking out a nice sized vibrating dildo and butt plug, the\nsmallest vibrating cock rings they had, even though none of them\nfigured they would even fit the boys properly yet, but they would\nstill be enjoyable, as well as a pair of anal beads and a really\nhot looking, but fairly small double ended dildo that the boys\ngiggled about but said might be a lot of fun. The dads only laughed\nand said it was, but theirs was a lot larger. \u201cYou guys have some\nof this stuff?\u201d Bobby asked. \u201cHow do you think we know of this\nplace, we've both come here several times and we have all this same\nstuff, just bigger. Now, pick out some good lube, we suggest either\nthe boy butter or the anal ease, but there are some really fun ones\nhere as well.\u201d Billy smiled largely. \u201cWow, okay.\u201d Both boys said,\nso they went to the large selection of lubes and picked out three\njars, none of them small either. There was one of each boy butter\nand anal ease, they both figured they may as well try them out, and\nthen there was a smaller jar of a heating one that the men said was\nenjoyable. \u201cAnything else boys?\u201d Danny asked as they were leaving\nthe toy room. \u201cNothing that I can think of, but, you think you guys\ncan do the rest of the shopping yourselves?\u201d Bobby asked, blushing.\n\u201cSure, we don't need you boys, but we did want your opinion on\nthings, so today we'll go get the things that we don't want your\nopinion on and we'll drop you off at home.\u201d Billy smiled warmly to\nhis overly horny baby boy. \u201cThanks.\u201d They went and paid for their\npurchases and then the men drove the boys home. They hopped out of\nthe car with their bags before it even stopped and yelled goodbye\nto the dads before they even realized what was happening. The men\njust laughed, did not even bother to get out of the car, and both\nsilently wondered if the boys would even be awake when they did get\nback home, and they figured that they would be several hours. \u201cI\nthink we should've saved that stop for last.\u201d Danny said as they\nwere pulling out, they had both just finished laughing. \u201cNo\nkidding. Did you see how horny they were, man, I wasn't anywhere\nnear that bad 'til I was about fourteen or fifteen. Then again, I\nhardly knew what my dick was at their age.\u201d \u201cSame here, lucky baby\nboys for sure having such caring and understanding daddies to take\ncare of them. Sure wish I could've had what they have now when I\nwas their age, but then, I probably wasn't really ready for it,\nyet, but I sure was by the time I was twelve, I had a full\nunderstanding of who and what I was by then.\u201d \u201cSame here, though it\nwas closer to thirteen for me.\u201d \u201cSame, but I was still twelve.\u201d\n\u201cTrue.\u201d Billy laughed. They took off and headed on their way to\ntheir first stop, which was to be a restaurant supply store that\nthey knew of that would probably be able to help them with a vast\nmajority of their needs. When they arrived, they were pleased to\nsee that they were very much correct. Not only did they have the\nbulk quantities of food that they were going to be needing, but\nthey also had all the things there to keep the food all hot or\ncold, everything to serve it all, and they even carried huge packs\nof paper and plastic dishes. They copied down all the prices of\neverything that they would be needing, because they wanted to check\nout a few places so as to get the best possible deal. They figured\nthough that they would be able to get almost ninety percent of\ntheir purchases just from that one store if they so desired, but\nthey did not want to over pay for things either, so they headed to\ntheir next stop. They hit five more places throughout the day,\nchecking all the prices at each one. Two of the places were rental\nplaces, and while they had much of what they wanted, in some cases\nit was actually cheaper for them to buy what they wanted, and most\nof that from Preteen\nUnderage Nymphet the first store. The only benefit was that\nthey would not have to store it afterward, but they figured they\ncould easily sell it after they were done as well and make some of\ntheir money back, so that was what they decided to do. They would\nstill rent most of the big stuff, but the large cook stove and a\nmassive barbecue they decided to just buy, because they would come\nin handy later anyway, but the tables and chairs and the large\nshelter were far cheaper to rent. Finally, some five hours later,\nthe men had had enough shopping for one day, they had found a lot\nof great things, so they headed home. Both wondered once again if\nthe boys would be awake, and they hoped that they would be diapered\nif they were asleep. As soon as they made it in the house, the boys\nstarted talking excitedly. \u201cI can't believe that our dads bought us\nall that cool stuff, I'm so hard still it hurts.\u201d Bobby said first.\n\u201cI know, so am I, wanna go try it all out?\u201d \u201cOh yeah, for sure.\u201d\nThey nearly ran to their bedroom and jumped on the bed, both of\nthem still carrying their bags with all their goodies in them. They\neach dumped out the contents of their bags and sorted through it\nall and opened up all the packages. \u201cHow should we do this, I've\nnever really played with my bum too much before, other than putting\na finger inside?\u201d Donnie asked. \u201cSame here, so let's start out that\nway on each other, and I so wanna try sucking you as well. We could\ndo it at the same time, suck each other, a 69, and finger each\nothers bums. Should we take our diapers off though to do it?\u201d \u201cThat\nsounds so hot, but no, I'd rather leave my diaper on and poke a\nhole in the bum of it and pull the front down.\u201d Donnie said\nhappily. \u201cOkay.\u201d They both stripped quickly until they were\nstanding there in only their diapers, and even though they were\nstill little baby boys, you could still tell how happy and horny\nthey were from the bulge that they were both pushing. They hopped\nonto the bed, head to tail, and pulled down the front of each\nothers diapers at the same time. Neither had sucked before, but\nthey had both read a lot about it and had really wanted to try it,\na lot, and before too long, they sucked each other in. Thirty\nseconds at best is all they managed to last for their first orgasm,\nthey were both just too horny, too charged, and they exploded. They\ndid not stop though, not even a little, they just Preteen Underage\nNymphet kept sucking. It felt absolutely amazing to them both, and\nthey wished they could do this forever. Almost a minute after their\nfirst orgasms, they both started petting the others bum through\ntheir soggy diaper and then started poking a hole in it in the\nright place. Once they had the holes in place, Bobby reached out\nand grabbed the first jar of lube his hand touched, got it opened\nup, even though he could not see it at all, and then scooped some\nonto his fingers and reinserted them inside Donnie's diaper. He\nthen passed the lube to Donnie, who did the same thing. They each\nvery easily inserted one slender finger in each others small back\npassages, both of them moaning softly as the others finger slipped\ninto them. Neither was at all uncomfortable or in any pain, it just\nfelt so good. Orgasm number two happened roughly ten seconds after\ninsertion. Yet they still did not stop, in fact, they seemed to\njust be starting. Ah, the power of youth. Just after coming down\nfrom their second orgasm, they slipped a second finger inside each\nother and started really going at it now. They were really enjoying\nthemselves, and within only a couple minutes, they were almost\nready to explode again, so just before doing so, they each inserted\na third finger inside each other. Then they fired off again, this\ntime it was even more powerful than even their first. They both\nloved having the other inside them like this, it felt so good to\nthem, so right. They managed to suck and finger one more orgasm out\nof each other before they both finally collapsed and laid on their\nbacks, staring at the ceiling for a good ten minutes, waiting to\ncome down fully. When they did, Bobby turned around and pressed his\nlips to Donnie's and they kissed. \u201cWow, that was totally awesome.\nWanna try the dildos now?\u201d Donnie asked. \u201cHeck yeah.\u201d Bobby said\nhappily. \u201cSame way as we fingered each other?\u201d \u201cFor sure, that was\ntotally awesome.\u201d So they got into position once again and sucked\neach other, each grabbing a dildo and presenting it to their\nbrothers baby boy hole at the same time and then inserting them.\nThese toys, while some of the smallest the store had, were still\nlarger than the boys' three fingers were, so they were a bit of a\nstretch, but the boys only moaned lowly from the incredible\nfeelings they caused. Once again, there was no pain. Through three\nmore orgasms, they used the dildos on each other and sucked each\nother, both of them enjoying it so much that still they did not\nwant to stop, even though they were both getting very tired. After\nthat third orgasm, they both collapsed back down again and came\ndown for a good fifteen to twenty minutes this time. \u201cWow, that was\nso incredible. Wanna really bum fuck each other now?\u201d Bobby asked,\nsaying the F word for the first time in his life, but he really\nmeant it. \u201cSure, what did you have in mind?\u201d Donnie asked huskily.\n\u201cHow about this?\u201d He answered, grabbing the double ended dildo and\nshowing it to Donnie. \u201cAre you thinking what I think you're\nthinking?\u201d \u201cHow it would feel to have our padded soggy baby bums\ntogether with this in between us!\u201d Bobby grinned. \u201cOh yeah.\u201d They\nboth got up on their hands and knees and worked so that they were\nbum to bum. Bobby took the dildo and worked the one end into his\nbum first, and once he had it in as far as he could, Donnie took\nthe other end and worked it into himself as well, backing up once\nhe was able to, until their diapers were pressed together. They\nboth sighed deeply, this was officially the most kinky thing either\nof them had ever read about and or dreamed about, and it was better\nthan they ever imagined it could be. They stayed still for a couple\nminutes just enjoying the feelings, and then together they started\nmoving. The moved until they were about half way, then backed back\ninto each other. This dildo was a good twenty five percent larger\nthan their dildos were, so it was a very nice stretch for them, and\ndoing it this way was doing things to them that neither had ever\neven thought were possible. Their first orgasms this time came\nafter only about two minutes, but once again they did not even\nbother to stop. They were both getting insanely tired, they were\nboth burning up from all the exercise, their breathing was becoming\nlabored, and neither one wanted to stop any time soon. They managed\na further two orgasms though before their bodies finally had\nenough, and as soon as they came for their last time, with twin\nscreams I might add, they both passed out. They fell to their\nsides, diapered bums still touching, their double ended dildo still\nfirmly inside them, and they slept. They were still sound asleep\nalmost an hour later when their dads finally made it home. As they\nwere walking up to the house, the men were talking. \u201cYou think the\nboys will be awake?\u201d Billy asked. \u201cI'd be surprised if they were,\ngranted, if they are, I'm almost willing to bet that we find them\nin a compromising position.\u201d \u201cHell, we Preteen Underage\nNymphet might find them sleeping in a compromising position.\u201d\nBilly laughed. \u201cI wouldn't bet against you.\u201d Danny laughed as well\nas he opened the door. The boys had not even bothered to lock it\nbehind themselves in their hurry to have fun. \u201cI don't hear\nanything.\u201d He said as they entered. \u201cWanna go check their bedroom?\nI bet they didn't even close the door.\u201d Billy grinned. \u201cOkay.\u201d They\nheaded to the bedroom and almost laughed out loud when they found\nthe boys sound asleep, their diapered bums still touching, but in\nthe position they were in, the dads could still easily see the\ndouble ended dildo stuck inside both of them. \u201cGee, that brings\nback memories, doesn't it?\u201d Billy laughed quietly. \u201cYeah, but at\nleast they're still wearing their diapers, so there's no mess.\nRemember when we did that the first time, we woke up and the bed\nwas a mess.\u201d \u201cYeah, apparently they're smarter and left their\ndiapers on from the beginning. Though they're so full that they're\ngonna start leaking soon, and the holes in their bums aren't\nhelping any either.\u201d \u201cNo kidding. Should we wake them or let them\nsleep and learn on their own?\u201d \u201cLet them sleep. There's a better\nthan even chance that we wouldn't wake them up anyway. Wonder how\nlong they've been out for?\u201d \u201cHard to say, but considering that\nthey're both still so sweaty, probably only half an hour or so.\u201d\n\u201cProbably. You wanna head to our room and have a little fun before\nthe babies wake up?\u201d \u201cHell yeah.\u201d Danny grinned, and they skipped\nto their room and had wild sex for a good half an hour, then\ninstalled a butt plug into each other and finally changed each\nothers diapers. Once they were ready, they did something that they\nhad never done in their homes before, left their bedrooms in only\ntheir diapers. Finally, almost an hour after the dads made it home,\nthe boys woke up. They grumbled a bit to each other, before they\nwere finally able to make sense and actually spoke to each other.\n\u201cWow, that was totally awesome.\u201d Bobby managed to get out first.\n\u201cNo kidding. We should probably get up and change our diapers. I\nthink we might've leaked a bit and I'm really full.\u201d \u201cYour diaper\nor your bum?\u201d Bobby giggled. \u201cBoth. Only one of which I want to fix\nright now.\u201d \u201cYou thinking trying out our butt plugs?\u201d \u201cFor sure and\nthen we need to change our diapers. Wonder if our dads are home\nyet!\u201d \u201cHard to say, but probably. We had to have been out for a\nlong time, because I feel lots better now. I still hurt, and I\nstill feel great, but just before we passed out, I thought I was\ngonna die I hurt so bad, it was awesome.\u201d \u201cSame here.\u201d They gently\nextracted themselves from their toy, grabbed each others butt plugs\nand inserted them, with not even a hint of a grunt from either, and\nthen they changed each others ruined diapers. They had both leaked,\nbut not a huge amount, so that was good. While Bobby collected all\nthe messed bedding, Donnie grabbed all the toys, and they headed to\nthe bathroom, which was also the laundry room, and they both got\ntheir things in to wash. Once that was taken care of, they took the\nnow cleaned toys back to their bedroom and put them away, then went\nto find their dads, wearing only their diapers. \u201cHi boys. From the\nposition we found you in, we take it that you had a really good\ntime?\u201d Billy smiled warmly to the boys once they came in. \u201cOh yeah,\nit was incredible, thanks so much for buying them for us.\u201d Bobby\nsighed. \u201cYou're welcome. We're glad that you boys enjoyed them and\nit sounds as if you did it properly. How do your little holes feel\nnow?\u201d Danny asked. \u201cReally stretched, but that's mostly because we\nhave our butt plugs in now. They're awesome though.\u201d Donnie smiled\nbrightly. \u201cKnow how you feel, we do too. Sounds as if your diapers\nleaked a bit too, hence the sound of the washer.\u201d Billy said.\n\u201cCool. Yeah, we passed out and our diapers were too full, so we\nleaked a bit, thankfully not lots though.\u201d Donnie said. \u201cBeen\nthere, done that, no worries. Just remember to keep your waterproof\nmattress protector on your bed for just such an emergency and\nyou'll be fine. We'll have to remember to get you boys a new one\nwhen we buy your new bedding tomorrow.\u201d Billy said. \u201cOkay, thanks.\u201d\nBoth boys said. \u201cSo, what all did you guys find today, and did you\nbuy anything?\u201d Bobby asked. The men told of all their shopping and\nall that they had found out, both saying that they would probably\ngo back the following day to pick up everything that they could,\nthe boys were happy to go along and help out. For the rest of the\nday, they all spent it in the house, watching TV and talking about\nthe up and coming wedding. The boys ended up still very tired and\nwent to bed early, and though they did suck a good orgasm from each\nother before changing their diapers, they were unable to play for\nas long as they usually did. The men went to bed a while later and\ndid the same for each other, and they all slept well. Chapter 4 The\nfollowing morning, all four of them emerged from their bedrooms at\nalmost the same time, all of them still in their very soggy night\ndiapers. They all smiled at each other and then went and made and\nate breakfast. Once that was all cleaned up from, they all headed\nto their bedrooms, where they changed and dressed their boyfriends,\nand once they were all packed and ready to go, they headed out. It\nwas a long day of shopping, because they went and bought all that\nthe men had found the day before that they could get right away,\nand it was a good thing that they had thought to bring both\nvehicles for this trip, because they stuffed both of them full.\nThey also hit a few other stores or places, and with the boys' help\nthey picked out all the different things that were going to be\nneeded for the wedding. They picked which colors were going to be\nused, they decided on both their favorites, royal blue and a really\nnice red. It looked really good together. They picked the flowers,\nthe centerpieces, the wedding arch that they wanted, the table\ncloths, everything. Now all they had to do was get everything in\nplace and they would be set. Much of that they took with them right\naway, other than the flowers and the arch, which of course they had\nto order, so they did so. Finally they made it home and the boys\nwere told to go on in and have a bath and remove their butt plugs,\nsince it was not a good idea to leave them in too long. They\nthought a bath was a great idea, so went and did so. They all went\nto bed at their regular times and had a good sleep, after making\nthemselves more tired of course. Monday morning the men got up and\nwent to work after waking the boys and wishing them a good day, and\nreminding them that the new bed was to be delivered and that they\nhad to get their bedroom cleaned and ready for it. They were good\nwith this, so got up just after their dads left, had a little fun,\nchanged each others diapers and then dressed each other for the\nday. They went and made and ate some breakfast, and then went back\nto their bedroom to figure out how they were going to arrange it.\n\u201cSo, how should we do this then?\u201d Bobby asked. \u201cNot a clue. It's\nbeen your room a lot longer than it has mine, so I hoped you'd have\nPreteen Underage Nymphet a clue as to what to do in here.\u201d\nDonnie grinned. \u201cFair enough, but no, it's just always been this\nway, it's how it worked. Not even sure why I had two beds in here,\nnever had anyone ever spend the night.\u201d \u201cIt worked out in the end,\nand maybe your dad hoped you'd be more social and have friends\nover.\u201d \u201cProbably. I suppose we should just start by taking the beds\napart and taking them out. I hope we can figure that out and\nthey're not too heavy, because I've never taken furniture apart in\nmy life, and I'm not very strong.\u201d Bobby shrugged. \u201cI'm sure we'll\nfigure it out, it can't be that hard, and between the two of us,\nI'm sure we'll be strong enough.\u201d \u201cOkay.\u201d They started by removing\nthe bedding from both beds, and then the mattresses. Once that was\nall removed and taken to the garage, they went back and tried to\nfigure out how to take the bed frames apart. After looking for a\nfew seconds, they found that it was super simple, the side rails\njust clipped into the end posts, so removing them was as simple as\nlifting them up, and the mattress base was simply a piece of\nplywood that they had to remove first, so they did so, and took\nboth of them out to the garage as well. They then got the beds\napart and found that once apart, they were able to easily grab a\npiece each and take them out. They took the four trips necessary\nand got them there. \u201cWell, that wasn't too bad, was it?\u201d Bobby said\nonce they were standing there surveying their handiwork. \u201cNo, it\nwasn't actually. Now that the bedroom's almost empty though, I\nthink I have an idea.\u201d \u201cWhat is it?\u201d \u201cWith our rather large closet,\nwhich was way bigger than my dads old walk in closet at the\napartment by the way, and it was big, why not move some of the\nshelves around in there, since they're all moveable, put the\ndresser in there, and we can just put all our small things in there\nand fold and stack the rest of our clothes on the shelves. That'll\ngive us a lot more room in here, even with one larger bed. Then we\ncan put the bed under the window, and we should probably ask for\nanother desk for in here and they can go side by side. I haven't\neven been able to set up my computer yet because I have nowhere to\nput it. Same with my TV, you don't have one, but if we move the\nbook shelf and adjust a couple of the shelves on it, we can put the\nTV on it and have it at the end of the bed, so that we can lay in\nbed and watch it if we want to. I say the desks go on that wall\nthere.\u201d Donnie suggested, pointing everything out. \u201cSounds good to\nme, but I doubt the two of us together can move the dresser or the\nbookshelf, and the desk might be tough too. They're all real wood\nand really heavy my dad said. I remember him bringing it all in\nwhen he got it for me a couple years ago, and even he thought it\nwas heavy.\u201d \u201cMaybe, but we can always empty them and try, and if we\ncan't, then we can ask our dads to help us when they get home.\nAlso, he had to move three heavy pieces a long way, we won't have\nto move them far, and I bet if we put a blanket under them, we can\nslide them pretty easily on the wood floor.\u201d \u201cOkay, that works, and\nit doesn't hurt to try right.\u201d Bobby smiled. So that was what they\ndid. They started off by adjusting the closet how they were going\nto need to, then got to work on getting the dresser in there. They\nfound that once the six drawers in it were removed, that it was\nsurprisingly easy to slide on a blanket, in fact it was harder to\nget the blanket under the dresser than it was to move it once it\nwas under. They got the drawers back in place and moved all their\nstuff around so that it was all good. Since they both wore the same\nsize, it did not matter if their clothes got mixed up. They ended\nup just throwing out all their underwear, Preteen Underage\nNymphet had all their socks in the top drawer, their pajamas in\nthe second, tank tops and diaper shirts in the third, tee shirts in\nthe fourth, long sleeve shirts in the fifth and shorts in the last.\nAll their pants were folded up on the shelves. They thought it\nworked perfectly. With the dresser out of the way, which had been\nwhere they wanted the bookshelf to go, they were now able to move\nit into place, but it too was full of stuff. Just as they were\nabout to start unloading it though, the doorbell rang, and they\nknew their new bed had arrived. They ran to the door and greeted\nthe delivery guys and showed them where the new bed was to go, so\nthey did so and were gone in about half an hour after getting it\nall set up. \u201cWow, it looks great in here and it's a really good\nmatch for the rest of the furniture too.\u201d Bobby said once they were\nalone again. \u201cYeah, it does. I almost want to ask you if you want\nto test out the new bed, but we should get the bedroom finished\nfirst.\u201d \u201cOh god, now you're making me Preteen Underage\nNymphet want to say to heck with setting everything up and test\nout the new bed too, but we can wait.\u201d Bobby said, physically\nhaving to force himself to snap out of it, they had more important\nthings to be doing. Donnie just laughed. They emptied the\nbookshelf, just throwing everything onto the new bed in the\nmeantime, and then they were able to move it. Once again it was\nharder to get the blanket under it than it was to move it once it\nwas. Once in place, they adjusted the shelves and Donnie found the\nbox with his TV in it and they placed it on the shelf. They then\nwent and laid on the bed and made sure that it was in a good\nposition for them, and it was, so they started putting everything\nback onto it, omitting some of the things that had been on it\nbefore, so that Donnie could put some of his things on it as well.\nNext was the desk, and it was easier, but only because it was\nsmaller. They still had to take Bobby's computer off it before they\ndared Preteen Underage Nymphet move it, but once it was\nmoved, they got it set back up again and then they were almost\ndone. \u201cNow all we have to do is make the bed. Did you ever transfer\nthe bedding from the washer to the dryer though, because I forgot\nto?\u201d Donnie asked, because they had thought to put it in the night\nbefore. \u201cUm, no, I didn't. Crap. Oh well, it won't take long to dry\nanyway.\u201d Bobby said as they headed to the bathroom to do so. When\nthey arrived, they did not find the bedding in the wash though, so\nBobby checked the dryer, and sure enough, it was in there. \u201cHmm,\none of our dads musta switched it over or us. That's good though.\u201d\nDonnie said and they grabbed the bedding. They opened the mattress\nprotector once they made it to the bedroom and got it put on,\nPreteen Underage Nymphet and then they made their bed with\nall the new linens. It was a really nice thick soft cotton, just\nplain white bedding, and a very nice patterned blue blanket to go\nwith it, it was exactly what the boys wanted. \u201cWow, this looks\ngreat. Wonder when our dads will take us shopping for a new desk\nthough, because I'd like to get the room finished soon.\u201d Bobby\nsaid. \u201cSame, but maybe they'll take us tonight. It's only one\nthing, so it won't take long.\u201d Donnie shrugged. They realized that\nit was after lunch and they were both getting very hungry, so they\nwent and made and ate lunch, cleaned that up, and then decided that\nthey should probably go change their diapers, since they were\ngetting very full as well. Well, a diaper change for two horny baby\nboys always takes a long time, but this diaper change took even\nlonger than that, and they each fired off five orgasms in five\ndifferent positions, all while using their regular dildos on each\nother and sucking each other. \u201cMmmm, that was nice, and this new\nbed is so comfortable.\u201d Donnie sighed deeply. \u201cMmmhmm, I agree.\u201d\nBobby sighed even deeper still. \u201cWanna try out our new baby shorts\nthat we bought the other day?\u201d \u201cOkay. With or without shirts?\u201d \u201cI\nsay without, then we can go play outside for a bit.\u201d Donnie said\nbrightly. They hopped up and went and grabbed their diapers and\noutfits, then came back and changed and dressed each other. \u201cMy\ngod, you look hot like that.\u201d Bobby moaned once they were done and\nhe really looked at Donnie. \u201cYou do too. Wouldn't it be funny to go\nto the playground like this, or even better yet, with a double\nthick super soggy diaper on underneath it.\u201d \u201cI'd be so\nembarrassed.\u201d \u201cMe too, but I bet a few boys and men cum from seeing\nus like this.\u201d Donnie giggled. \u201cI bet you're right, but no, I don't\nthink it's a good idea. We'd probably end up getting hit on and\nhaving to say no to a hundred guys who want sex, because I only\nwant you.\u201d Bobby smiled warmly. \u201cYou're probably right.\u201d Donnie\nsmiled back just as warmly. They headed out to the back yard and\nplayed for a while, just having fun and being the boys that they\nreally truly were. They played outside for a good three hours, in\nfact it was almost time for the dads to come home when they finally\ndecided to call it a day and go in and make dinner. The men walked\nin less than half way through the dinner making process. \u201cDon't you\nboys just look adorable.\u201d Billy sighed. \u201cThanks Daddy, these are\nawesome. Thanks so much.\u201d \u201cYou're welcome. So, did the bed come\ntoday?\u201d \u201cSure did.\u201d Both boys said as one. \u201cAnd we have a favor to\nask.\u201d Bobby said. \u201cWhat's that.\u201d \u201cA favor, well it's a question\nthat one asks when they are hoping to get something but cannot pay\nanything for it.\u201d Bobby said so straight faced it amazed both\nDonnie and Danny. \u201cOh, you Sir are a brat. What's this favor you\nwish to ask.\u201d Billy laughed, Danny and Donnie could also not hold\nit in and burst out laughing as well. \u201cThanks. Well, we changed the\nroom around, and we realized that we sorta need another desk,\nbecause mine isn't big enough for the both of us, so can we go out\nafter dinner and buy one please?\u201d Bobby grinned. \u201cI don't see any\nreason why not. Let us go take a look at your bedroom and then\nwe'll come and help you make dinner. As soon as we're all done and\ncleaned up, then we can go.\u201d \u201cOkay, you may as well change your\ndiapers while you're at it too, you're starting to show a bit.\u201d\nDonnie suggested. \u201cGood idea. We would've just changed after\ndinner, but that works too.\u201d The boys continued working while the\ndads went and looked at the bedroom. Once they saw what all they\nneeded to see, they headed to their bedroom and changed each other,\ngetting redressed as well, since they were going out again right\naway. They met the boys back in the kitchen a few minutes later and\nhelped to finish it off, and as they did so, they talked. \u201cI really\nlike how you boys set up the room, it's perfect.\u201d Billy said. \u201cI\nagree. What kind of desk do you want though?\u201d Danny asked. \u201cJust\nsomething that matches the desk that's already in there was about\nall we were thinking of.\u201d Donnie shrugged his shoulders. \u201cYeah.\u201d\nBobby added. \u201cWhat if we just got you one larger desk, would that\nbe okay? There's lots of room there, so we could make it almost any\nsize we wanted and still have room left over.\u201d Billy said. \u201cSuppose\nso. Doesn't really matter what we do I guess. You're the designer,\nso we'll let you figure it out.\u201d Bobby shrugged. \u201cI have a few\nideas that you boys might like, we'll just have to go shopping and\nsee what we can come up with. So, did you have any problems with\nthe furniture delivery, and how exactly did you move the old stuff\naround anyway, considering most of it's heavier than you boys are?\u201d\n\u201cNo, we had no troubles at all, and we just put an old blanket\nunder the things we needed to move and slid them into place, then\nremoved the blanket. It was really easy actually.\u201d \u201cThat's good,\nthat's using your head. Use your head, not your back I always say.\u201d\n\u201cOh trust me, we still used our backs.\u201d Donnie giggled. \u201cYes, I bet\nyou did, and that's good too, but you did it in such a way that it\nreduced the amount of raw strength you needed, which neither of you\nreally has yet, and let you be able to do something that was\ntechnically above your abilities. By using your brains, you can\nachieve almost anything you can think of, when your body would\nsurely fail you.\u201d Billy said proudly. \u201cGee, thanks for not calling\nus weak or anything?\u201d Bobby sighed animatedly. \u201cUm, you're ten\nyears old, you're both really skinny and have almost no muscle\ntone, I hate to say it, but raw strength is nowhere near your\nabilities. We're the same though, trust me, that's not a bad\nthing.\u201d Danny laughed. \u201cWe know. Would be nice to at least have a\nlittle muscle, so that the kids at school couldn't push me around\nso easily. I mean, there's a boy in my class that's a head taller\nthan me, his arms are already bigger around than my legs, and he\npicked me up easily last year and threw me. That's just not fair.\u201d\nBobby said sadly. \u201cNo, but how much should I bet that he didn't get\nan all glowing report card with the suggestion that he skips a\ngrade. How much should I bet that if you two were put Preteen\nUnderage Nymphet to a mental challenge that he'd be so outclassed\nthat you'd stomp him in under thirty seconds. And how much should I\nbet that he's more insecure of his inabilities than you are. Trust\nme, I went through all the same things, took all the same teasing,\nboth Danny and I did, we feel you boys' Preteen Underage\nNymphet pain, but just remember, they bully and tease you\nbecause you have something they don't have, and can probably never\nget, smarts. Sure, they can apply themselves and work hard and make\nthemselves as smart, just like you boys could work out and make\nyourselves stronger, but does that really change who you are. No,\nnot really. Not that you boys shouldn't get some more definition\nand work out some, you probably should, same as we probably\nshould've when we were your age, but not to help Preteen\nUnderage Nymphet you beat up other kids.\u201d \u201cI know, you've\ntold me all this before, well except to work out some, but it's so\nhard being picked on and teased all the time. I know you know,\nyou've told me all about what you went through, and Donnie told me\nall the stories of what he and his dad went through, so we're all\nthe same here, but that doesn't really make it any easier to deal\nwith.\u201d \u201cNo, but it lets you understand that you're not alone. Once\nyou boys go back to school, you'll have each other, and there's\nstrength in numbers. Of course, bullies are usually pack animals\ntoo, emphasis on animals of course, but as long as you stick\ntogether, they can't hurt you. You boys do know though that with as\nmuch as you've started to love diapers and how much we can tell you\nwant to wear them all the time, that once you get to school, the\nkids will find out, eventually at least, and the taunting and\nteasing will only intensify. What will you boys do then?\u201d \u201cI know,\nand I guess we'll just have to deal with it as best we can, and\nlike you said, at least we'll be together.\u201d \u201cThat's good. The\ndecision is yours though as to whether you wear diapers or not, we\nwon't tell you yes or no, that has to be up to you.\u201d \u201cThere's no\nchoice really. If you're half as much a diaper lover as I am, then\nyou know what my answer will be, and I can only assume that Danny\nand Donnie's answers would be the same.\u201d \u201cThey are.\u201d All three of\nthem said as one. \u201cYeah, that's what I thought. No, I want to wear\nmy diapers full time from now on, and no amount of bullying will\nchange my mind. Can we get some weights and stuff though, so that\nwe can try working out a bit?\u201d Bobby asked. \u201cThat's a good boy.\nYou're so much stronger and smarter than I was at your age. Hell,\nit was only a couple years ago that I really started to realize\nhalf of what you already know.\u201d \u201cThanks.\u201d They finished off dinner\nshortly thereafter, then all sat down to eat. Once they were\nfinished, they cleaned up, and then the boys were urged to go\nchange. They giggled and said, 'ah why, we wanna go out like this.'\nThe men laughed and said yeah right. The boys did go and change\ntheir clothes, as well as their diapers though, then checked their\ndiaper bag, just in case they were out for a while, and then they\nall headed out. Billy pointed them not to a furniture store, but\ninstead to a lumber yard, and when the boys asked why, he told them\nthat it was one of his ideas, and to just leave it to him. When\nthey arrived, they all went inside and looked around for a bit.\nBilly asked the boys if they liked the same woods that were in the\nbedroom already, and they both said that yes, they did, so he\npointed them at some plywood that was ten foot long that matched\nwhat they had in their bedroom. \u201cWhy are you looking at plywood\nDaddy?\u201d \u201cBecause, I think that this'll make a good work station,\nand with three end tables that match what you already have, they'll\nmake the uprights, Preteen Underage Nymphet as well as good\nstorage. It'll be strong enough, it'll look good, and you'll be\nable to fit everything and more that you need to. If you like that\nidea, then we'll get them to cut it for us, so that we can\ntransport it.\u201d \u201cCool, that sounds like a really good idea.\u201d \u201cGood.\u201d\nBilly went and asked one of the guys to cut the sheet into three\nsixteen inch strips for them, so he did, and while he was doing\nthat, Billy led the others to the veneer section and grabbed the\nedge banding that he would need to finish off the edges. He also\ngrabbed a few wire grommets so that they could drill holes in the\nwork top, but have it look nice. When the boys asked what the rest\nof the plywood would be used for, he told them that he would just\nuse it for shelving somewhere, since good storage was never a bad\nthing, especially since they were going to have a lot of catering\ntype things to store. He also grabbed a couple pairs of keyboard\nslides, so that the boys could have hidden keyboards. Once the\nplywood was all cut, they paid for their purchases and loaded them\nin the truck, then headed out. Billy took them to the furniture\nstore next and they picked out three end tables that were identical\nto the ones the boys already had. They had three drawers in each\none, though they did decide to grab one with only one drawer and a\ncupboard as well, for just in case. He also grabbed them a smaller\nbook shelf that could be set right on the desktop to store things\non. The boys also needed another desk chair, but Billy grabbed two\nnew ones, since Bobby's chair was getting old and rickety. They all\ndecided that that was going to be more than enough for the bedroom,\nso they paid for their purchases and then loaded it all in the\ntruck as well and headed home. Once they made it home, the boys\nwere instructed to go in and start removing everything from the\ndesk in their bedroom, the men saying that they would bring in all\nthe stuff for their new desk. The boys were good with this, so went\nand did so right away. The dads just brought everything into the\nbedroom, and as soon as they were done bringing it all in, they\ntook the Preteen Underage Nymphet old desk out, because the\nboys had just finished emptying it as well. They then all helped to\nput everything together, and then Billy grabbed the iron and a\nrazor knife and applied the edging. Once that was applied, he\ngrabbed his drill and the right stuff and installed the keyboard\nslides and drilled for the wire grommets. When that was done, he\ntrimmed off the excess edging, and with that, they were complete.\n\u201cWow, this is a really cool desk, thanks so much Daddy.\u201d Bobby said\nhappily. \u201cYeah, it does look good in here, you're welcome.\u201d \u201cWhat\nare you gonna do with the old desk though, it's in really good\ncondition still?\u201d \u201cProbably use it in the kitchen as a phone desk,\nsince we don't have one and we do have the space for it. You boys\ngo ahead and start getting your desk put back together, we'll take\ncare of that.\u201d \u201cOkay.\u201d The boys both said. The men headed out and\ngrabbed the desk and took it to the kitchen as planned. \u201cWanna\nstrip down to just our baby diapers?\u201d Donnie asked. \u201cOkay.\u201d Bobby\nsaid happily, loving having the freedom to wear just his diapers\nnow. They both stripped down to just their diapers and then got\nstarted on putting their new awesome desk together the way they\nwanted it. Donnie had to grab his computer that was still boxed up\nand he got it all hooked up while Bobby was setting his up as well.\nBoth boys had fairly nice systems, not high end, but good. Just as\nthe boys were finishing up, the dads walked in, also in only their\ndiapers. \u201cLooks good boys.\u201d Danny said. \u201cThanks.\u201d Both boys said.\n\u201cWe're just about to sit down to watch a little TV before bed, you\nwanna come join us, or do you still have more work to do?\u201d Billy\nasked. \u201cNo, I think we're good for the night, so we'll join you. If\nwe think of anything else, we can do it later. What all did you\nguys do, because it can't have taken you that long to do what you\nwere gonna do?\u201d Donnie asked. \u201cWe got the desk in place and got it\nall set up properly, then we went and got more shelf supports put\nup in the garage and put up the two new shelves and got a few\nthings stored on them.\u201d Danny said. \u201cThat's good, and it looks like\nyou got comfortable as well.\u201d Donnie grinned. \u201cYeah, we did, pretty\nmuch as soon as we left you boys.\u201d Billy smiled. \u201cSame here.\u201d Bobby\nsaid. They all went and sat back and watched TV for the night, and\nwhen it was time for the boys to head to bed, they did, making sure\nto change each others diapers before they did, which of course\nstarted some fun times. Tonight they got into a 69 and sucked each\nother and fingered each other until they had three fingers in each\nother and three orgasms. Once they came down from their last one,\nthey slipped in each others butt plugs and called it a night.\nMonday morning, and the normal routine that was set the previous\nweek was pretty much exactly how this morning went as well. The men\nwere up and got ready for work, then went and woke the babies up\njust before leaving and then headed to work. The boys laid in bed\nsnuggling for quite a while before getting up, and the dads hopped\nin the truck today instead of the car and headed out. As they did\nso, they of course talked. \u201cI was thinking of taking off a bit\nearly today and going and grabbing the boys some workout equipment,\nnot that we can't stand to use it some either mind you.\u201d Billy said\nalmost as soon as they left the driveway. \u201cOkay, we can do that,\nbut I don't know how comfortable I am in getting the boys weights.\nIt's not good for their bodies to do weights yet, I've heard kids\nshouldn't do that 'til after puberty.\u201d \u201cI wasn't planning on\ngetting any real weights, because I've heard the same thing, but a\nlittle weight won't hurt them. I was just thinking some dumbbells\nto help them tone up a bit, which, like I said we could use too,\nand then stuff for them to do situps and pushups, jump ropes,\nthings like that that'll help more than weights.\u201d \u201cOh, that's good.\nI almost wish we had a pool, because that's the best form of\nexercise there is.\u201d \u201cWe could always put in an above ground pool,\nthey're not that expensive anymore, even for a good one, and we\nhave lots of space.\u201d Bobby said. \u201cWould you mind, especially with\nthe wedding coming up, that'll take up a fair bit of space in the\nyard.\u201d \u201cOf course I wouldn't mind, it's your house too now right.\nThere's lots of space, even with the biggest pool we can get, so\nthere's no worries there. The only problem is the money. We don't\nexactly have unlimited funds, and a good pool is still gonna set us\nback probably a thousand dollars by the time all is said and done.\u201d\n\u201cThat much you figure?\u201d \u201cYeah, I checked it out last year, because\nI was thinking of it then, but I decided not to, because just two\nof us wouldn't use it enough to pay it off I felt, but four of us\nwill. The one I wanted is eighteen feet across, round, fifty four\ninches deep, salt water purification, hard sides, solar blanket and\nheat, it pretty much had it all.\u201d \u201cOh. Well, as long as we don't do\nanything too terribly fancy or expensive for our honeymoon, then we\ncan still afford it, and with us doing all the work and doing the\nwedding at home and for as Preteen Underage Nymphet cheap as\npossible, we should be fine. We both have lots saved and owe no\nmoney, as well with both of us paying the mortgage and utilities,\nwe're gonna do far better now, so unless you don't want to, I say\nlet's go for it.\u201d Danny smiled. \u201cOkay, and I agree about money. It\nwas never tight for the two of us, but I did have to be careful,\nbut now with two of us making good money and living together,\nthat'll save us more as well.\u201d \u201cThat's good. So, you figure we\ncould leave at lunch then, go get everything, then come home and\nsurprise the boys?\u201d \u201cSounds good to me, we'll just have Preteen\nUnderage Nymphet to ask the boss, but I'm sure he'll be okay\nwith it, especially if we tell him it's wedding related.\u201d \u201cYeah, he\nsure was happy about us getting married and gave us as much time\noff as we wanted.\u201d \u201cYeah, but then I've always suspected he might\nbe gay too.\u201d \u201cYou think so?\u201d \u201cHard to say really, maybe he's not,\nmaybe he's bi, but could you imagine the look on Jim's face if he\nfound out his boss was gay too.\u201d Billy laughed. \u201cNo shit. Did I\ntell you about my run in with him on Friday though?\u201d \u201cNo, you\ndidn't.\u201d \u201cI didn't think so, I just remembered about it. Anyway, I\nwas just about to go into the bathroom as he was, he was before me,\nand as soon as he saw me entering as well, he sounded as if he\nchoked, and then turned around and left, and under his breath he\nsaid something. I can't be sure what he said, but it sounded like\nhe said I'm not going to the bathroom with a fagot. I just shook my\nhead and went and did my business and left. I mean, like I'd want\nto do anything to him anyway, and I was gonna be in a stall, so\nwhat did he think would happen, that I'd look over the wall and\nwatch him or something stupid like that.\u201d \u201cWho knows what could\npossibly be going through the mind of a gay hater. He hasn't come\ninto the bathroom when I'm in there either, but that doesn't\nexactly bother me.\u201d \u201cNah, it doesn't bother me either. Should we be\ntelling the boss you figure?\u201d \u201cProbably not a bad idea to let him\nknow, so that he can keep an eye out for him, but we'll have to\ntell him not to confront Jim either, that'll only cause us more\nproblems.\u201d \u201cFor sure.\u201d They continued talking the rest of the way\nto work. Just as they were pulling in, the boys were just crawling\nout of bed. They had not even said one word to each other yet, they\njust stayed cuddling up to each other until they decided to get up.\n\u201cWanna double diaper each other and then put our cute baby shorts\non Baby?\u201d Donnie asked. \u201cOkay.\u201d Bobby said brightly. Donnie hopped\nup and grabbed all that they would be needing and came back to the\nbed. They double diapered each other and then got each other into\ntheir cute snap crotch shortalls. With a super thick double diaper\non under them, they looked even more adorable than they had before.\nOnce they were all dressed and ready to go, they went and had some\nbreakfast, and then went and laid back for a bit and watched TV.\nAfter a couple hours of that, the boys went out back and played in\nthe yard for a couple more hours, until they were ready for lunch\nin fact, so they went in and made and ate that. After lunch, they\nwent back outside to play, and that was where they stayed until\ntheir dads came home. Billy and Danny went right to the bosses\noffice as soon as they made it to work and asked if he would mind\nthem taking off at lunch time, saying that they had some things for\nthe wedding to take care of, and he was perfectly okay with that.\nThey also told him about Jim and how he was acting toward them\nsince they came out, and he said he had already seen it a few\ntimes, and furthermore had already talked to Jim about what he had\nwitnessed, and told him that it was either shape up or ship out,\nthat he would not have any of his employees feeling uncomfortable\nbecause he did not like gays. Billy and Danny were happy with this,\nthen headed off to their offices and got started on their work for\nthe day and worked hard until lunch time, then said goodbye to\neveryone and headed Preteen\nUnderage Nymphet out. Their first stop was where Billy had\nfound the pool last year that he liked, so they went in and looked\naround. They found almost the same model of pool, but it was twenty\nfeet around now, but the same depth, and it came with a better pump\nand large sand filter instead of a standard cartridge filter, as\nwell as the salt water purification. The solar heater was also\ndifferent, it looked bigger and the sign said high performance, so\nthat was good. The Preteen Underage Nymphet price was a\nhundred dollars more than it had been the previous year, but\nconsidering all it came with, Billy was more than happy with that.\nThey went to the sales desk and talked to a guy there and asked if\nthey could get the pool they wanted, and just on a long shot, Billy\nasked if there was a sale price for it. The guy hummed and hawed\nfor a moment, then said business had been slow lately, so he would\nlet it go for a hundred and fifty less to ensure he got the sale.\nThe men were happy with that. In fact, with their savings, they\ndecided to get a few of the pool accessories as well. They grabbed\nenough foam dumbbells for them all for doing resistance training in\nthe water, they grabbed a few pool noodles and boards, for fun and\nfor working out with, they grabbed a set of diving rings, a pool\nthermometer, a pool cleaning Preteen Underage Nymphet head\nthat they could attach and let it go and it would clean all by\nitself, and then finally a few floating lounge chairs. Their total\nwhen they went up to pay for everything was almost a hundred\ndollars more than the original price of the pool, so that was\nexcellent. They got everything loaded into the truck and took off.\nUnfortunately that store had not carried anything other than pool\nstuff, so they had to go elsewhere for the rest of the workout\nstuff. For that, Billy pointed them to another store and they went\nin, and the store was having a large inventory blowout sale and\nclaimed that everything was on sale, so once again, the men were\nhappy with that, because that meant they could buy more for less.\nThey grabbed a good set of dumbbells, a weight bench with barbell\nand a few light weights for it, a couple good skipping ropes, and a\nfew other small things they could all use. The weight bench was a\nmulti purpose one, you could use weights on it for leg exercises,\nand it could be locked in position for doing situps as well. All\ntold they only spent a couple hundred dollars there, but they had a\nlot to show for it. They loaded all their purchases into the truck\nas well and hopped in. \u201cSo, anything else before we head home?\u201d\nBilly asked before he started the truck. \u201cNothing that I can think\nof.\u201d \u201cOkay.\u201d He said and started the truck and headed home. They\ndrove all the way home talking excitedly about all that they had\nbought and where they were going to put it all, and when they got\nhome, they backed in and Billy had them right by the gate to the\nback yard for ease of offloading. They headed in to find the boys,\nonly to find them already in the back yard. \u201cOh, there you boys\nare.\u201d Danny said. \u201cHi Daddy, what are you doing home already?\u201d Both\nboys asked at the same time. \u201cWe have a surprise for you. We took\noff early and went and got a few things that we'll all enjoy and\nget good use out of. We have the truck parked by the gate, no one\ncan see you boys from there anyway, so come help us unload and\nbring it to the back yard here.\u201d Billy said. \u201cOkay.\u201d They headed to\nthe truck, after Billy unlocked and opened the gate, and then when\nthe truck was opened up so that the boys could see inside, they\nboth gasped. \u201cYou bought a pool, how cool is that!\u201d Bobby said.\n\u201cYes, we did. It's a bit better version of the one I was dreaming\nof last year but decided not to get. We also got a few other things\nfor working out, so we can all get in better shape, since none of\nus seem to have too much tone, even if we're all thin.\u201d Billy\nsmiled. \u201cThanks Daddy.\u201d Both boys said and came and hugged their\nrespective daddy. \u201cWell, what are you boys waiting for, let's get\nthis offloaded. We'll get the pool though, it's bloody heavy.\u201d\nDanny said happily. \u201cOkay.\u201d They both said, and then with a\nvengeance, the boys tore at the stuff and hauled it all into the\nback yard. Once the pool was free and clear, the dads grabbed that\nand took it to the back yard as well. Bobby was asked to go close\nand re-lock the gate, then they all worked to pull everything out\nof the box for the pool and they all helped to put it together.\nThankfully it was not hard to do, and they already had a perfect\nplace for it. There was for some reason a large concrete pad in the\nback yard, and it was more than large enough for the pool to fully\nsit on, and there was still space left over. Billy figured that\nwhomever had put it in had either put it in for a pool or a shop,\neither way, it worked perfectly for them. It took a good couple\nhours for the four of them to get it all built, but by the time it\nwas dinner time, they had it done. Now all they had to do was fill\nit with water. Preteen\nUnderage Nymphet They stuck the hose in it and then they headed\ninto the house to make and eat dinner. After dinner was finished\nand cleaned up from, they all headed out and got started on\nunpacking the rest of the stuff. The boys asked where they were\ngoing to put the weights and stuff, and they were told by the dads\nthat it would all stay out on the covered deck, and since they had\nsuch mild winters, they could still use it all year round. Though\nthe pool may not be comfortable for swimming in, because the solar\nheat would likely not be able to keep it that warm. By the time\nbedtime rolled around, the pool was still less than half way to\nbeing filled up, but they did get the pump going with the salt in\nthe water, they put the solar blanket on, not only to gather what\nheat it could first thing in the morning, but to keep crap out of\nthe pool too, and then they shut off the water and the boys headed\nPreteen Underage Nymphet to bed. Bobby and Donnie stripped\neach other down to their super wet diapers, they had not changed\nall day and it showed, then stripped them off and put each other\ninto fresh diapers after removing each others butt plugs and\ncleaning each other off. Once they were ready for bed, they laid\ndown and kissed and rubbed two orgasms from each other before\npassing out. They slept peacefully all night long, all cuddled up\nto each other. The dads went to bed themselves not long after and\nthey too changed each other and then kissed and jacked each off\nbefore they too fell fast asleep in each others arms. Chapter 5 The\nfollowing morning after the men headed to work, the boys got up and\nwent out and started the hose again to finish filling up the pool.\nThey had been asked to not use the pool until later, so that the\ndads could check everything, but they did ask the boys to make sure\nit was full. After they got the hose going, they went in and made\nand ate breakfast, and then went back out and worked out for a bit\nwith what they had. They only worked for about half an hour before\nthey were tired and decided to quit, and while neither of them did\nany real weights, it was still more than enough for them. The pool\nfinished filling an hour past lunch time, so the hose was turned\noff and pulled from the pool, and then the boys played or watched\nTV for the rest of the day until their dads came home. \u201cHi there\nour soggy little baby boys, how was your day?\u201d Billy asked as he\nand Danny walked in the door. The boys were sitting on the couch in\njust their very soggy diapers. \u201cGreat, how about yours?\u201d Bobby\nasked. \u201cNot too bad. Is the pool full?\u201d Danny said. \u201cYep, and we\nworked out for a bit this morning too.\u201d Donnie said. \u201cThat's good.\nTry and get a light workout every day, try for about an hour a day.\nWe're gonna do the same, we'll probably join you, but we should all\ndo it in the morning, we'll just have to get up earlier is all.\u201d\nDanny said. \u201cOkay, I suppose we could get up earlier and join you\nguys, but we only lasted half an hour this morning.\u201d Bobby said.\n\u201cAnd that's fine. We probably won't fare much better ourselves to\nstart, but we Preteen\nUnderage Nymphet all do need it. Even I can admit I'm too\nskinny and have no definition, and the rest of you are pretty much\nthe same.\u201d Billy said pointedly, looking at both boys' clearly\nshowing ribs for emphasis. \u201cYeah, you're right.\u201d Danny said,\nchuckling. \u201cDid you boys make dinner?\u201d \u201cNo, we totally forgot, we\ndidn't even realize the time, sorry.\u201d Bobby said. \u201cThat's okay,\nwe'll all go in and figure something out and then we can all make\nit. But tonight, we can just do something simple and quick.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Everyone said. They all headed to the kitchen and took some\nchicken out of the freezer and they decided to make a simple\nchicken salad with it and got everything ready. It did not take\nlong at all and they were eating, and then cleaning it all up. As\nthey were cooking, the men excused themselves for a few moments to\ngo strip down, so that by the time they were eating, all four of\nthem were dressed the same way, that is to say they were all in\njust their wet diapers. After that, they all headed out to the back\nyard, because the men wanted to check the pool, Billy grabbing the\nwater testing kit from the counter as they were going. Once they\nmade it outside, Danny started by removing the cover to the pool,\nwhile Billy opened up the kit and grabbed the instructions for it\nto see how the hell he was supposed to test the water. It took him\nabout ten minutes to do so, but by the time he was done, he felt he\nhad it figured out, so went and got some water and tested it. It\ncame back pretty good, just slightly off, so he read the\ninstructions on how to rectify it and then did so. He then tested\nthe water temperature, though the other three had already done so.\n\u201cThe water's not so bad already, but I guess it was a good sunny\nday. Still pretty cold though, so I say we wait 'til tomorrow,\nmaybe by then it'll be fine.\u201d He said, throwing the thermometer in\nthe water to see just what temperature it was. It was probably only\none or maybe two degrees warmer than the water had been after\nfilling it, but that was pretty good considering the amount of\nwater that was in there and how quick the solar heater had already\nheated it up by. \u201cCan we swim in it by ourselves tomorrow while you\nguys are at work Daddy?\u201d Bobby asked. \u201cI don't know, because one\nthing I don't know is how well Donnie swims. I know you've been in\nswimming lessons several times and can swim very well, but I\nwouldn't want you by yourselves if only one of you can swim.\u201d \u201cI\ncan swim great, I love swimming.\u201d Said boy said right away. \u201cHe's\ntaken several swim lessons as well and swims like a fish, so I'd be\nfine with it if Bobby swims just as well.\u201d Danny said. \u201cOkay boys,\nbut you have to promise to be careful of course, and remember, the\nwater's about as deep as you are tall, so you won't be able to\ntouch bottom and still breath, and there's to be absolutely no\ndiving.\u201d \u201cOkay.\u201d They both said. \u201cAre we allowed to swim naked?\u201d\nBobby asked. \u201cI don't see any reason why not. With sixteen foot\ntall cedar hedges all the way around the yard, there's no way\nanyone can see us in the yard, unless they're in the yard or\nsomehow looking through the hedges, so sure, why not, and that's\ncertainly how I want to swim as well.\u201d Billy smiled. \u201cWicked.\u201d Both\nboys said. \u201cWhy would you even bother asking though, you boys come\nout here dressed in just diapers, swimming naked would be less\nembarrassing than that?\u201d Danny had to ask though. \u201cIt's not about\nembarrassment, we weren't sure if we'd be allowed to or not. Most\nparents wouldn't let their kids swim naked, even if the pool is\ncompletely concealed. Thankfully you guys aren't most parents\nthough, you guys are wicked cool.\u201d Donnie said happily. \u201cThanks,\nand I have no idea why most parents would even care, but whatever.\nAll I say is poor kids who aren't allowed to.\u201d Danny laughed. They\nall went in the house for the night and relaxed until it was\nbedtime. The boys headed to bed, changing each others diapers and\nplaying with each other for a bit before finally falling asleep.\nThe following morning the men headed to work and when the boys got\nup and started their day, they decided to just strip down totally\nand went and got themselves some breakfast, because they wanted to\ngo for a swim. Once they were ready to do so, they headed out back\nand got the cover of the pool off. \u201cYou sure you wanna do this,\nit's probably still pretty cold?\u201d Donnie had to ask. \u201cSure, why\nnot. Can't possibly be any worse than swimming at the lake.\u201d\n\u201cThat's probably true, but to tell you the truth, I hate swimming\nthere because the water's so cold, I prefer the pool in town, it's\nnice and warm. This body doesn't do so good in the cold.\u201d \u201cI tell\nyou what, after we've swam and played for a while, I'll take you\nback to our bedroom and warm you up real good.\u201d Bobby grinned\nbrightly. \u201cWell hell, throw in some ice and let's go swimming.\u201d\nDonnie said and was the first to start climbing the ladder to enter\nthe water. Bobby just laughed and climbed up with Donnie and they\nboth stood on the platform. Bobby counted it off, and as soon as he\nhit three, they both jumped in the water. \u201cHoly crap, it's real\ncold.\u201d Donnie surfaced and screeched out. \u201cOh, it's not that bad.\nKeep whining and when we get inside I'll just have to diaper you\nlike a big baby.\u201d Bobby teased. \u201cOkay.\u201d Donnie grinned, but with\nchattering teeth, it looked weird. \u201cGet moving, it'll feel warmer\nonce you start moving. Should we try and swim hard and workout for\na bit?\u201d \u201cWe probably should.\u201d So they did. They swam good and hard\nfor a good twenty minutes, and then Bobby hopped out and grabbed\ntwo sets of the foam dumbbells and jumped back in and they started\ndoing some water aerobics with them. They found this a lot harder\nthan it had seemed, because the nearly weightless dumbbells had a\nhuge amount of resistance in the water, thus making them work far\nharder than they thought they might have otherwise. They lasted\nonly another twenty minutes. \u201cWow, I'm done, but I am warmer now,\neven if the water's still really cold.\u201d Donnie gasped. They had\nworked good and hard, both admitting that they really needed this,\nso they worked hard to do it right. \u201cYeah, same here. Let's just\nswim and play now for a bit.\u201d \u201cOkay.\u201d They stayed in the water for\nalmost half an hour longer, just playing and having fun, but\nfinally they had had enough, so they hopped out. Both boys started\ngiggling as soon as they saw each other out of the water though,\nbecause they were so cold they looked like girls. They knew a way\nto bring them back out of hiding though, and they planned to do\njust that, but they got the pool closed up first, because they knew\nthat if they did not, they would not do it. They had better places\nto be after all. They headed into their bedroom as quick as they\ncould, and by the time they made it, their boy bits were already\nstarting to show. They were already starting to get hard in\nanticipation of what was to come, but even still, by the time they\nmade it, they were still so cold that neither was anywhere near\ntheir full sizes yet. They hopped onto the bed and landed face to\ncrotch and started sucking each other. That was all they needed to\nwarm up and fully harden. Within a few seconds of starting, they\nboth slipped a finger into each other's moist little bum holes and\nstarted fingering each other. Bobby rolled away for a second and\ngrabbed the lube, which was not hidden at all, just sitting on the\nend table. He popped the top and grabbed some lube, then passed it\nto Donnie, who happily took it, then took some himself, Preteen\nUnderage Nymphet and before too long, they were fingering each\nother with three fingers each. They exploded only seconds after\ntheir third fingers entered each other. \u201cI want you to fuck me\nplease?\u201d Donnie pulled away and asked seconds after they finished\ncumming. \u201cDick or dildo?\u201d \u201cI want your dick in me, it'll be our\nfirst time, we've never actually fucked each other with our dicks.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Bobby said brightly. Donnie rolled onto his back and pulled\nhis legs open and back a bit, showing Bobby just what he had\nplanned. Bobby thought this looked good, so with his hot hard\nlittle baby erection leading the way like a heat seeking missile,\nhe zeroed in on his target and his aim was true. He hit his target\nfirst try, and slipped in all the way. They both moaned lowly.\n\u201cWow, and here I thought the dildos and butt plugs were good.\nYou're not nearly as big, but you're so hot and hard, and I can\nfeel you pulsing in me.\u201d Donnie sighed deeply. \u201cYeah, and you're so\nhot and soft inside, and I can even feel you pulsing from inside as\nwell, it feels incredible.\u201d \u201cDo it, make love to me.\u201d Bobby needed\nno further encouragement, he just started thrusting softly and\nslowly, pulling out until he was in danger of slipping out, and\nthen slipping all the way back in. It was pure bliss for both boys.\nWith their main tension already released, they had hoped that this\nwould last longer, but unfortunately little boys are not known for\ntheir lasting powers. That did not stop them though. As soon as\nthey came, they just kept right on going. In fact, Bobby only\npaused for just a second as the feelings washed over him like the\nwaves of the ocean crashing over him. Through two more earth\nshattering orgasms, Bobby made love to Donnie, then they traded\nplaces and lasted for another two incredible cums. \u201cWow, that was\nway better than I ever imagined it would be. Can you grab the butt\nplugs though and fill me up, and then we definitely need to get\ndiapered?\u201d Bobby asked. \u201cYeah, it was.\u201d Donnie said dreamily.\nDonnie grabbed the butt plugs and they both inserted them into the\nother quickly, then they grabbed their diapers and cream and\ndiapered each other the way they both liked. The rest of the day\nwent by quickly and they had fun and rested as well, and then the\nrest of the week went much the same way. They went out and swam and\nor worked out in the morning, then played for the rest of the day.\nSometimes they were outside, sometimes inside, sometimes they\nwatched TV or sometimes they played video games. They of course\nalso made love to each other a few more times throughout the week,\nas well as used their toys a couple more, and in these ways they\nkept themselves well drained. Though technically neither boy had\nanything to drain. This weekend the four of them went about more\nshopping, and on Saturday all four of them had their suit fittings,\nso they had go do that. If the man who was to do the fitting was\nsurprised that all four of them were in diapers, he said nothing.\nHe was the utmost in professional, though they could all tell he\ncame in his pants when the boys stripped down to just their diapers\nto try on their pants. After their fittings they went about the\ndaunting task of ordering all the food that they would be needing,\nmost of it would be delivered the day before, but a good portion of\nit was to be delivered the morning of, so that it was perfectly\nfresh. Both men talked to their moms Sunday night and went over all\nthe plans again to make sure everything went off without a hitch,\nor at least any unexpected ones, because there was only to be one\nexpected hitch. They were all good with their duties and made sure\nthat they would have all the help they would be needing from the\nrest of the families. It was getting eerily close to the wedding\nthough and both men were starting to panic, wondering if they had\nbitten off more than they could chew, planning a wedding in only a\nmonth. It was this coming weekend, they had to go to work only\nMonday and Tuesday, and then they were to be off for three weeks.\nThey would be gone for two weeks after the wedding and then be home\nfor a couple days before having to be back to work. The boys of\ncourse did all that they could do, amongst working out and playing\nof course, and they were a huge help. Wednesday the tent, chairs,\ntables, and all the other fixtures arrived. The tent guys set up\nthe tent, but the rest of it was to be up to the men and boys to\ndo. They had it done by the end of Wednesday. Thursday they had\ntheir final suit fitting, and when they went in, they were deemed\nperfect, there were no last minute alterations that had to be made,\nso that was good. They also deemed it neighborly to write up a\nletter to all the neighbors stating that there was to be a wedding\nand party at the house Saturday night, that it would be loud and\nthe street would be full of cars. A few of the neighbors were\nfriends of theirs and were invited, but for the rest, they did not\nwant to annoy too much. They did appreciate the warning when they\nread their letters and many of them decided it would be a good\nnight to go out. Most just figured they would stay home, since it\nwould be of little concern to them. Friday all the food that was to\nbe delivered, as well as Preteen Underage Nymphet all the\nflowers were delivered, and what they could prepare, they did. Some\nof it was delivered to their parents places, so that the moms and\naunts could do what they could to help out, but the men and boys\ntook on almost half the work themselves. They also got almost\neverything set up outside that they could, so that they had less\nwork to do the following day. Saturday morning finally arrived, the\nmen were both nervous wrecks, Billy had thrown up, Danny almost\ndid, but they both managed to eat a tiny bit of breakfast. The boys\nlaughed at them and told them they were going to be fine, and that\nif by chance anything was forgotten, it was too late to worry about\nnow, so there was no point in worrying about it, that they would\njust figure it out. As soon as they were ready to do so, they got\nstarted on the cooking projects that just had to get started, and\ngot started on preparing the rest of it as well. The delivery for\nall the fresh fruit, vegetables, breads and pastries arrived when\nthey were supposed to, and they got that all prepared as needed as\nwell. The wedding ceremony was to take place at three, then the\nparty was to go from after that until everyone was too tired to\nstand any more, so they figured twelve or so. The parents and\nseveral of the aunts and uncles arrived at just after eleven, all\nof them bringing food and last minute things that needed to be done\nstill. Billy's mom and dad brought in the cake, and when Billy and\nDanny asked to see it, they were told to back away from the cake,\nthat they would get to see it once it was revealed to them after\nthe ceremony. They took it to a table, got it all set up, after\ntelling the men to get their butts in the house, and then once it\nwas set up, it was covered again. \u201cSo, Bobby, who's this?\u201d His\ngrandma asked him of Donnie. \u201cThis is Donnie, he's my brother now.\u201d\n\u201cOh, that's so nice. It's good to finally meet you Donnie. So,\nBobby, anything else you care to tell us about your brother?\u201d She\nasked. \u201cSure, he's my boyfriend as well, and another secret, we're\ndiaper lovers as well.\u201d \u201cI thought I detected a diaper under your\npants when I hugged you. Your dad doesn't know I know, but I know\nhe is as well, and so's Danny, isn't he?\u201d \u201cYeah, I sorta thought\nyou knew, and I felt you pat my bum, that's why I told you.\u201d He\ngrinned. \u201cThought so. So, are you two excited?\u201d \u201cSure, but we\ndidn't need the wedding ceremony really for Preteen Underage\nNymphet them to be husbands or us brothers, and Preteen Underage Nymphet they our\ndaddies, but they wanted to. We might do the same when we're old\nenough, but we'll figure all that out later. By the way, the cake\nwas really nice. Daddy's gonna cry when he sees it.\u201d \u201cThanks, and\nthat's why I didn't want him to see it yet.\u201d \u201cCool.\u201d \u201cOh, there's\nmy grandparents.\u201d Donnie said and then called them over. \u201cHi\nGrandma and Grandpa, this is Bobby and his grandparents.\u201d He\ngreeted and then introduced them all. \u201cHi Donnie, my don't you look\ncharming.\u201d His grandma said, picking him up and patting his bum\ntoo, then she got a grin on her face. \u201cYeah, in case you missed\nthat, I'm wearing a diaper, I'm a diaper lover. And this is my new\nbrother, and boyfriend too, Bobby.\u201d \u201cThat's what I thought. You're\nso much like your dad it's scary sometimes.\u201d She laughed. \u201cSame\nwith Bobby.\u201d His grandma said. \u201cYeah, the boys are diaper lovers\ntoo, but I've known about Danny since he was sixteen for sure that\nhe loved diapers. I'm happy you two are so much more free than your\ndads are.\u201d \u201cThanks. How'd you know he was a diaper lover back then,\nhe said he never wore diapers at all?\u201d Donnie asked curiously. \u201cAh,\nbut he did, whenever he had the chance. He thought we didn't know\nabout his using towels and putting them in his underwear and\nwetting them, but we did.\u201d \u201cHah, now that's funny, because Billy\ndid the exact same thing, and his occasional wet beds were more\nthan likely not as accidental as he played them up to be. He was\ntrying to work up the courage but always failed to get his\ndiapers.\u201d \u201cSame with Danny. We started seeing it when he was about\nten or so, right around you boys' age actually, but by the time he\nwas sixteen, we were pretty sure of it, same with his being gay. I\ntell you, the day he came home and said he got a girl pregnant was\nPreteen Underage Nymphet the biggest shock of our lives.\u201d\n\u201cYep, same with Billy. Well, as much as I'd love to stay and get to\nknow you guys, we really do have a lot of work to do and not a lot\nof time left to do it, so what say we all get together later and\ntalk and get to know all the dirty details of our soon to be son in\nlaws.\u201d \u201cSounds like a date.\u201d The boys giggled and they all took off\nand continued working hard to get everything prepared. The next few\nhours went by in a madhouse of activities, not one of them stopped\nrunning the entire time they felt. Just before the ceremony, all\nfour of them went into the house to change their very wet diapers,\nand then shortly thereafter, it started. Once everyone was seated,\nthe music started, but neither of the men were walking down the\naisle, they were to just enter from opposite side, greet in the\ncenter, hold hands and walk the rest of the way to where they were\nto stand. Danny's dad was taking all the photos for the event, he\nhad a very nice camera, and he was snapping away merrily. The\nactual ceremony took only fifteen minutes, it was totally non\nreligious, and then all the paper signing took a further fifteen\nminutes, and then they declared married and introduced as the\nBray-Dee's. The entire crowd stood as one and applauded the new\ncouple. For almost an hour the two of them had their pictures\ntaken, the boys having to join them for several as well, and then\nbefore too long, the party started. Billy stood up to start the\nspeeches. \u201cWell, here we all are. I bet almost none of you expected\nto ever come to a wedding for me, since it seems that my being gay\nwasn't nearly as big a secret as I thought it was. I know almost\nall of you almost laughed when I said I was getting married, and\nthen you chuckled at the irony of it when I told you to whom I was\nmarrying. I never felt that anyone would understand or accept me as\nbeing gay, I guess I didn't really have to worry about it so much.\nI have so much now to be thankful for that I couldn't really truly\nbegin to say it all, but I do have a few people to thank. To my\nwonderful son, who has been by my side since the day he was born,\nand just laughed at me and said I know, I'm not stupid you know\nwhen I told him I was gay. To my loving parents, how you didn't\nkill me in my teen years, I really have no idea, thanks for always\nbeing there and accepting me for who and what I was without\nquestion. To my grandparents, who I wish were still here, thanks\nfor spoiling me rotten, even though half the time I didn't actually\ndeserve it. Preteen Underage Nymphet To my aunts, uncles and\ncousins, thanks for all the fun times that we had together. To my\nsisters and brother, thanks for all the years of torture and\ntorment, I loved every second of it, and I hope you loved every\nsecond of it I managed to give back to you. And finally to all my\nfriends, thanks for sticking by my side, even when I told\nPreteen Underage Nymphet you my biggest darkest secret, I\nthought you'd all take off and never Preteen Underage\nNymphet talk to me again, I guess that didn't happen. Without\nyou all, I certainly would not be here today, so once again, thanks\nfor everything everyone and tonight, we party.\u201d Everyone cheered\nand his parents had tears in their eyes. Danny Preteen Underage\nNymphet stood up next, and he too gave his speech. \u201cMuch like\nBilly, I too was scared to death of telling anyone that I was gay,\nand same as his family and friends, they pretty much already knew.\nAll the family had pretty much the same reaction to my telling you\nthat I was getting married that Billy did, and I Preteen\nUnderage Nymphet almost laughed at some of your reactions as\nwell. I too must thank all my family and friends for sticking by\nme, even though you knew I was gay. I thought then that it was the\nultimate wrong to love another boy, but then I Preteen Underage\nNymphet met another boy, Billy in case you missed it, and we\nfell in love. Together we have learned a lot about being gay, we\nalways knew we were, but neither of us had ever loved anyone\nbefore, at least not the type of love two partners should share,\nneither of us ever felt we could love another the way we thought we\nshould. Then we both got up the courage to meet each other and we\nfound that love. Did we have to get married? Nah, not really, it's\nonly a piece of paper after all right, but we wanted to. We wanted\nthe ceremony, we wanted everyone to be here with us when we stood\nup there and swore that we would be there for each other 'til do we\npart, and I for one hope that we last a very long time together.\nThis means the world to us, and we thank you once again for being\nhere with us on our special day.\u201d Once again the entire crowd stood\nand cheered and clapped. Bobby stood up next. \u201cTo my wonderful\ndaddy, you're finally getting what I knew you wanted and needed all\nalong. I'm glad that you finally told me and that you're getting\nmarried to a nice man, someone who doesn't hate me and wants to\nship me off to some boarding school.\u201d \u201cWho says I still might not.\u201d\nDanny grinned, everyone laughed. \u201cNah, you wouldn't do that.\u201d He\ngrinned. \u201cYou're right.\u201d \u201cAnyway, I'm also glad that I'm getting a\ngreat brother out of this and another great daddy too. Thanks for\nalways being there for me and I hope you have a great life.\u201d Once\nhe was done, everyone stood and clapped and cheered once again, and\nfinally Donnie got up. \u201cI guess I'm the last, and considering I\nhate doing this, I'm keeping it really short. Let's eat, I'm\nstarving, I haven't eaten since six this morning.\u201d For some reason,\nDonnie got the loudest clapping and cheering. The head table got up\nand went to the food tables and started dishing up first, so the\nmen and their boys and parents, and then the rest of the people\nwent up in an orderly fashion and they all dished up. If there was\nPreteen Underage Nymphet one person there that did not go\nback for seconds of the great food, it would have been a huge\nsurprise. Many went for more too, and the food was to be kept out\nall night so that everyone who wanted more to eat, could do so.\nFinally it was cake time. The grandparents led the newlyweds to the\ncake platform and Billy's mom lifted the cover. The entire crowd\ngathered around them all and they all oohed and awed as it was\nuncovered, and like she had surmised, Billy started crying. \u201cOh\nMom, it's so beautiful, you outdid yourself.\u201d He cried happily,\n\u201cYou're very welcome my beautiful baby boy. I made sure it was\nextra perfect just for you. And it's your favorite as well. Triple\nfudge chocolate cake. I hope no one here's allergic to chocolate,\nbecause this cake will send them to the grave, forget the\nhospital.\u201d She grinned, everyone laughed. \u201cThanks Mom.\u201d He smiled.\nIt really was a beautiful cake, not much for fancy decorating, but\nit was perfect in every way, and on the top were just two male\nfigures holding hands, looking at each other. The men almost felt\nbad for cutting it, but they did not want to insult Billy's mom\neither, because it was meant to be cut, so cut it was, and then\nthey fed each other a piece of cake, then cut and served all their\nguests, Billy's mom being the first. Everyone enjoyed the cake a\ngreat deal, probably everyone going back for seconds, and in some\ncases thirds, but those they got to serve themselves. Finally the\nmusic was started, and the first song that they had in their play\nlist was to be the two of them dancing alone, and they danced to\ntheir favorite song, I Hope You Dance, it was very beautiful. The\nsecond song the men grabbed their moms and danced with them, and\nthen the dance floor was opened up for all to enjoy, and for the\nnext several hours, enjoy they did. Bobby and Donnie even got up\nand danced together several times, both of them admitting to their\naunts, uncles and cousins that they too were gay. No one seemed at\nPreteen Underage Nymphet all surprised by that news either. About\nhalf way through the night, Danny's mom got on the microphone and\nsaid that she felt it was gift opening time, so the music was\npaused and the gift table was brought to the center of the dance\nfloor. There was not a lot on it though, because both men already\nhad everything they really needed. There were a few gifts there\nthough, but for the most part, it was just nice artwork and things\nlike that, and each gift giver was thanked gracefully. Then they\nstarted opening the cards, and they found that the invitations that\ntheir parents had sent out had said that money would be far more\nappreciated since they were all set up for the house anyway, and it\nwould be put toward their trip. Once again they read all the cards\nand thanked each person for all the money they had received. They\ndid not count it all, but by the end, there was almost four\nthousand dollars. There was nothing there from either of the\nparents, though the men had really not noticed that yet. The\ndancing commenced and when the men went to sit down for a bit to\nrest, Billy's parents came over, followed shortly thereafter by\nDanny's, and they all sat down as well. \u201cIn case you failed to\nnotice boys, there was nothing in there from us, since we wanted\nthis to be a surprise.\u201d Billy's dad started. \u201cActually, I hadn't\nnoticed.\u201d Billy admitted as his dad handed him an envelope.\n\u201cThanks, but why didn't you give this to us up there?\u201d \u201cLook\ninside, you'll know why.\u201d So he did, and inside were four first\nclass plane tickets to Mexico. \u201cPlane tickets to Mexico?\u201d He asked.\n\u201cYes.\u201d His dad said, and then Danny's dad handed Danny their\nenvelope. Danny opened it up and stared for a few seconds. \u201cTwo\nrooms at an all inclusive resort for two weeks?\u201d Danny asked,\nlooking up with tears in his eyes. \u201cYes.\u201d So Billy's dad explained\nit all. \u201cWe've been talking to each other on the phone, deciding\nwhat all we needed to do to prepare. One of the things was what we\nshould get you guys, so we decided that there was really nothing\nthat we could get you, and money didn't seem right, not from us, so\nwe decided to give you boys the trip. The kids are of course\nincluded, since you said they were coming with you. But this way,\nyou can use the money for other things around the house, and not\nhave to worry about a thing. You can also afford to take all sorts\nof tours and do all sorts of sightseeing while you're there,\nwhereas before you might not have been able to. The resort includes\nall meals, so you won't have to worry about that, and they're very\ngay friendly, we made sure to check into that, so there's no fears\nthere, so all you have to do is enjoy. You leave tomorrow morning\nat eleven, and we're driving you all to the airport.\u201d \u201cWow, thanks\nso much guys, this is too much.\u201d \u201cNo, it's about right.\u201d They all\nsaid. The men gave their parents hugs and thanked them a great\ndeal. From there on though everyone had a great time. Billy and\nDanny both sat with as many of their guests as they could to thank\nthem in person for their gifts and to just talk as well. It seemed\nuniversal though from all their guests that the wedding was\nbeautiful and that it had gone off perfectly. Finally at almost one\nthe next morning, the last of the guests left for home, though\nalmost everyone helped to clean everything up, so that there was\nnot a huge mess when they woke in the morning. The newlywed men and\nthe boys all crashed into their beds, nearly leaving their suits\non, and had it not been for the fact that they all desperately\nneeded diaper changes, they may have done just that too, but they\ndid, so they changed. There was no wedding night bliss for the two\nnewlyweds this night though, they were far too tired for that, they\nhad been going for almost twenty hours, and they were absolutely\nbeat. They actually fell asleep before the boys did, only by a few\nseconds sure, but before them none the less. The next morning they\nwere all up quite late for them, but it was still only just nine\nwhen they did roll out of bed, they all nearly crawled into the\nkitchen, they still looked absolutely wiped. Even the boys almost\nhad coffee to wake them up, but they all got some breakfast. Their\nflight left in just a couple hours, and they needed to get ready to\ngo though right away, so as soon as they had breakfast in them,\nthey all had the energy they needed to get their packing done. They\nall headed to their bedrooms and changed each other first, then got\ndressed, and finally they each packed a suitcase and a carry on\nwith the essentials. Not even ten minutes after getting their stuff\nready to go, both sets of parents arrived to the house. Billy's\nparents were to drive them, but Danny's wanted to see them all off\nas well. \u201cNow, you boys all go have a good time, we'll take care of\ngetting the yard all cleaned up and getting the rented stuff back\ntoday for you. We don't know exactly where you want all the stuff\nyou bought, so we'll just set it in a nice pile in the garage for\nnow.\u201d Danny's dad said. \u201cThanks Dad, that'd be great. We'll have to\nfind homes for it all, and we'll probably ask the family if they\nwant any of it, because while we'll keep some of it, we really\ndon't need it Preteen Underage Nymphet all.\u201d \u201cNo\nprob. Now, like I said, you boys go have a great time.\u201d \u201cThanks.\u201d\n\u201cLove you.\u201d His mom said. She gave them all hugs and kisses\ngoodbye, and then they all piled into Billy's parents van and took\noff for the thankfully short drive to the airport they were taking\noff from. When they got there, they got hugs and kisses from the\nparents once again and told to have a really good time and to have\nlots of fun, but stay safe. The men and boys headed into the\nairport with their luggage and were soon aboard their flight. This\nwas to be the first time the boys had ever flown, so they were both\nexcited and nervous, but they were okay. Takeoff was fun they\nthought, turbulence over the mountains they could have done\nwithout, but they survived, and finally the landing was nice and\nsmooth. They got off the plane and into the airport, collected all\ntheir baggage, and then headed outside into the stifling heat. They\nhad all had hot summers before, but nothing like what they were\nfeeling right then, and it almost took their breath away at first.\nThe resort had sent a van for them, so as soon as they were told to\nhop aboard, they did, and then they were off. They made it to the\nresort a little more than an hour later and they were helped to\ntake all their things up to their rooms. They were told that\nnormally families had adjoining rooms, but given the men had the\nhoneymoon suite, and normally newlyweds did not take their kids\nwith them, the men had to trust that their boys would be fine\nacross the hall in their executive suite. All were good with this,\nso they entered the boys' room first. Both boys gasped. \u201cMy god,\nthis place is bigger than our house is, and it's all ours for two\nweeks?\u201d Bobby managed to squeak out. \u201cYes Master Bobby, all we ask\nis that you do not order any alcohol, your grandparents already\nrequested that there be none in the room, and room service was\nasked not to bring it, but sometimes accidents happen. Please do\nnot do so or we may have to ask you and your dads to leave.\nOtherwise the entire suite is yours to use and enjoy to its\nfullest. We have also provided for you boys a mattress protector,\nand should a wet bed occur, please just leave it and we'll take\ncare of it for you, just put the sign on the door asking for\ncleaning and it'll be taken care of right away. The same is true\nfor you gentlemen. Should you also require any incontinent\nsupplies, we are fully stocked to take care of all our guest's\nneeds, and you may feel free to call for anything at any time, and\nI assure you, we can probably bring for you almost anything you\ncould ask for. Anything except of course things that may be\nillegal, but you know what we mean. Also, you may order from room\nservice at any time any food that you desire, or you may visit one\nof our dining rooms, we always have people on staff to cook for our\nguests. Almost all beverages can be brought to you as well, but\nonce again, no alcohol for you boys. We do strongly suggest though\nthat you stay away from the tap water, drink only the filtered or\nbottled water while here, most foreigners find our water makes them\na little sick at first. I've been to your beautiful country many\ntimes myself and I must say, your drinking water is far nicer than\nours is. I think I thought of everything, but should you have any\nquestions, of course, call at any time and we'll see what we can do\nto help you out.\u201d \u201cThanks for everything. The boys won't ask for or\ntake any alcohol anyway, so you don't need to worry about that any,\nbut everything else is great. So, I guess it's to our room next.\u201d\nBilly smiled. \u201cYes, of course, follow me.\u201d He said and led the four\nof them right across the hall and into the mens' suite. It was just\nas spacious, but was done up in a much more romantic d\u00e9cor, it was\nvery nice. They were all impressed with it to be sure. \u201cThank you\nvery much for all your help.\u201d Danny said and then passed the man a\nbill. All he knew was that it was worth about twenty dollars, but\nhad no clue how much it was there. The man thanked him happily and\nleft. \u201cOkay boys, let's get unpacked and check the place out.\nAlways keep your key cards on you at all times, and if for any\nreason we're not together and you need help or something, just call\nfront desk and ask for it.\u201d Billy said. \u201cOkay.\u201d Both boys said as\none and headed over to their suite. They took a few minutes to\nunpack all their stuff, change each others very wet diapers, change\ninto some nice shorts and a tank top, and they met their dads in\nthe hall. The men had done exactly the same thing and were out only\na second after the boys. \u201cOkay, let's go check the place out.\u201d\nDanny said excitedly and they all headed out. They toured the\nplace, just checking everything out for a good hour, before they\nall decided that they were getting pretty hungry, so they went to\none of the restaurants in the resort, sat down and ordered their\nfood a few minutes later. By the time they were finished eating,\nthey were all stuffed and ready to go, so they did. They decided to\ncall it a night and all headed up to their rooms, where not one of\nthem was thinking anything about sleeping. It may have been the\ndads' honeymoon, but the boys had almost as much to celebrate, and\nthey planned to do so for as long as they could. To say it was a\nlong night all around would be an understatement, but it was a very\ngood long night. They all played for more than two hours, the men\nactually outlasting the boys this night, but not by much, and then\nthey all passed out. Thankfully they were all diapered. The\nfollowing day they checked out all the options for tours and\nwhatnot after breakfast and decided on two different things for the\nday and then went and did them. One before and one after lunch,\nthen they had dinner and sat around Preteen Underage Nymphet\nthe pool for a couple hours before bed. It was a far more tame\nevening, but they did all play too. The entire rest of their stay\nwas the same though, they got up, had breakfast together, went and\ndid a couple activities through the day, and then back to their\nrooms. Before they knew it, and long before they were ready to do\nso, they were on their way home. They were all tired and happy and\nthey all slept all the way home. It was Danny's parents there to\ngreet them and take them home, though the men had not actually\nthought of who was picking them up, so they were just happy to see\nthat someone was. On the ride home, they told the grandparents all\nPreteen Underage Nymphet about Preteen Underage\nNymphet the trip and everything that they had done the entire\ntime they were there, and they were glad that the men and boys had\nhad such a good time. When they got home, Billy's parents were\nthere to greet them, and then the men and boys had to retell their\ntale again, but they were happy to do so, only this time they\nhooked up the camera to the TV and showed all the pictures as well,\nand considering Danny's parents stayed, they got to see it all as\nwell and hear more of what they had done. Finally after dinner, the\nparents headed home, leaving the boys to wind down and relax, and\nthey did. They all went and changed their diapers and then came out\nin just them and laid back on the couch for the rest of the night\nand watched TV. Chapter 6 As time seems to do, it whipped by far\ntoo fast. The week after getting back from their trip, the men had\nto head back to work, and they had a great time telling all their\nco-workers all about it. Though they did not have to put up with\nthe miserable one, because they got some good news. Apparently he\nhad gone into the bosses office while they were away and told him\nthat he should fire both Billy and Danny, because they were, in his\nwords, a disgrace to the company and to mankind. The boss fired him\ninstantly, and though he tried to say he would sue the company for\nwrongful dismissal, the boss was not worried, because he had a very\nstrict anti harassment policy in place, and that violated it to the\nextremes, and the miserable one knew what the consequences were, so\nit was his fault. Billy and Danny were happy with it, mind you, so\nwas everyone else. The boys got back into their routine that they\nhad started and worked out every day that they could, and by the\ntime summer ended, you could already see the difference in them.\nThey were still small and skinny, but now their ribs did not show\nand they were starting to get some definition in their taut tummies\nand chests. Even the men were working out with the boys as much as\nthey could, and they too were feeling the effects. The boys were\nstill insatiable of course, and almost every day they made love to\neach other a couple times in one form or another, but occasionally\nthey only did it once in a day, but it was rare. Before they knew\nit though, school was about to start, and they were both getting a\nlittle on the nervous side. A couple times the dads asked them if\nthey were still sure of wearing diapers to school, and both said\nthat they were very sure of it. Not only did they love them, but\nnow they almost truly did need them, because they hardly ever\nnoticed when they had to pee, so without them, they would surely\nhave accidents. They both said that they were just more nervous\nabout going to school and admitting that they were boyfriends,\nbecause they felt it would be better in the long run to let it out\nright at the beginning and let everyone get used to it, rather than\nhave them find out by seeing the boys together. The dads had to\nadmit that this was probably the best course of action, because\nthere was no way the boys could hide what they shared in front of\nthe other kids, they would see it instantly, and then tear the boys\nto shreds. On this front, both Billy and Danny had already went and\ntalked to the schools principal and warned him that the boys were\nnot only openly gay and out, but that they were going to admit it\non their first day, so that they did not have to hide it. He was\nshocked of course that a pair of young boys would admit such a\nthing, but did have to admit that if the boys were easy to read,\nthat it probably was for the best as well. He did ask though that\nthe men asked the boys to keep any open affection off the school\ngrounds or he would have to ask them to leave, they agreed to this,\nand so did the boys. They went and did all their back to school\nshopping and on the first day of school, the boys dressed in their\nnicest new clothes and headed out. It was only to be a half day,\nbut both boys felt that it was going to be a very long day. Bobby\nalready had some friends in the school, well, sorta friends really.\nHe knew them from school, but they had never done anything outside\nof school. They all congregated in the front to ask each other how\nthe summer was. The other kids had the usual stories, and then\nBobby got his chance to talk. \u201cWell, my dad got married during the\nsummer and I ended up with a brother. This is Donnie, but we really\nliked each other, to the point that we're actually boyfriends now.\nWhat's funny though is that our dads are gay as well, and they're\nthe ones who got married. Then after the wedding we went on a two\nweek trip to an awesome resort in Mexico, it was really nice.\u201d\nBobby said all upbeat. For the next several seconds you could have\nheard a pin drop. \u201cYou're telling us that you're gay?\u201d A boy named\nTimmy asked, he and Bobby had gone to school together their whole\nlives. \u201cYeah, and I have to wear diapers now as well, and so does\nDonnie, because his bladder never worked and mine failed totally\nright at the end of school last year.\u201d Bobby answered happily.\n\u201cOh.\u201d He and a couple others said. The boys could tell that this\nnews was not all that well received by the five boys. \u201cI can see\nthat none of you care to hear this, in which case I guess I won't\ncall you friends any more. Oh well, your loss.\u201d He said and both he\nand Donnie turned and walked into the school. A couple of the boys\nblabbed right away to others, whereas the rest of them were\nactually okay with the revelation, just shocked. None the less, by\nthe time their first break came about, almost all the older kids in\nthe school knew, some of the younger ones did too, but most of them\nfailed to truly understand what it meant, well, except the diaper\nwearing part. They got a couple taunts like gay baby, and things\nlike that, but they just smiled and waved at the offending student\nand went on their way. It actually did not bother them at all. They\nwere very happy with their decision and had found it far easier\nthan they thought they would. Finally they were released from their\nfirst day of school at what would normally be their lunch time, and\nTimmy caught up to them. \u201cHi guys. Sorry about my reaction this\nmorning, was just a bit of a shock is all. I wasn't the one to\ntell, I promise, though it doesn't seem to be bothering you guys.\u201d\n\u201cThat's okay, we knew it would happen, and we wanted it to as well,\nso that everyone can see that we're not bothered by it, so that\nthey can get it all out right now.\u201d Billy smiled. \u201cOh. You really\nhave to wear diapers though?\u201d \u201cYep, see.\u201d Bobby said and pulled his\nshirt and pants out of the way enough for Timmy to see. \u201cOh,\ndoesn't that sorta suck?\u201d \u201cNah, we actually love them, and to tell\nyou the truth, even if I did have control back tomorrow, I probably\nwouldn't give them up now. They're wicked comfortable and so\nconvenient you have no idea.\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d He blushed. \u201cOh, you do know.\u201d\nBobby smiled brightly. \u201cNo, of course not, what do you mean!\u201d He\npanicked. \u201cLet me guess, bed wetter, but sometimes when you're by\nyourself or when you can get away with it, you wear your night\ndiapers, don't you?\u201d Bobby asked quietly. \u201cNo, of course not.\u201d He\nsaid, but he was blushing madly and was nearly hyper ventilating.\n\u201cIt's okay to admit it to us, like we'd say anything. Have you\nadmitted that you're gay yet as well?\u201d Donnie asked. \u201cOh, you think\nhe's gay, I never noticed before?\u201d Bobby asked, but took a closer\nlook at his somewhat friend. \u201cSure, two of the boys Preteen\nUnderage Nymphet this morning were, I'm sure of it. You've\ngrown up with them, so you probably didn't notice it, because it\nwas just always that way, but I noticed right away. \u201cI'm not gay.\u201d\nHe said in a squeaky voice, nearly starting to cry. \u201cIt's okay if\nyou are you know. Look at us, we're happy, we're healthy, and we're\ngay. You don't have to admit it to us right now, maybe you aren't,\nonly you can say that, it's just what I feel, maybe my gaydar isn't\nfully active yet.\u201d Donnie giggled. \u201cGaydar?\u201d Timmy laughed, the\nterm sounded ludicrous. \u201cYeah, our daddies say that lots of gay\nguys have what's called gaydar, it's the ability to tell who's gay\nand who's not. Some people say it like it's a joke, but you know,\never since I truly admitted what I was, I've started noticing that\nother guys are gay, though some are iffy, so maybe they're just bi,\nwho knows. We still have a lot to learn I suppose, we're only ten.\nMind you, we both turn eleven really soon. Man, I can't believe\nwe're already in grade six, it's cool being the oldest in the\nschool.\u201d \u201cI....I.....I.....\u201d \u201cIt's okay, like Donnie said, it's not\nsomething you have to admit right away, even to yourself, but if\nyou are, you should accept it. Remember what the guidance counselor\ntold us all last year about teen suicide and what the number one\ncause was, he told us all about it during our sex ed class and what\ngay really was and that almost all kids that commit suicide do so\nbecause they can't handle being gay. Mostly because they think\ntheir families would hate them.\u201d Bobby said softly. \u201cThanks.\u201d He\nwhispered, and then before the boys could say anything further, he\nturned and headed off. The boys just let him go, the rest had to be\nup to him now. \u201cThat was interesting. So, you thought another of\nthem was gay too huh?\u201d \u201cYeah, pretty sure of it. The pretty blond\nboy.\u201d \u201cMikey.\u201d \u201cDidn't get his name, but if he's the one with the\nlong wavy blond hair, oh yeah, nearly went hard the first time I\nsaw him I thought he was so gay.\u201d Donnie giggled. \u201cSlut.\u201d Bobby\ngiggled too. \u201cWanna go home and get a little slutty together?\u201d\n\u201cThought you'd never ask.\u201d They ran all the way home and crashed in\nthe door, ran to their bedroom and jumped on the bed and then\nproceeded to make love to each other for an hour or more. Once they\nwere satisfied, they got out of bed and changed each others\ndiapers, then headed into the kitchen to get some lunch. They went\nand worked out on the equipment a bit and then played for the rest\nof the day, made dinner, and then ate it with their dads once they\ngot home. The boys happily told them about their first day of\nschool and their public outing and what had happened with Timmy.\nThe men were happy with the boys and told them so. The following\nday Timmy was not at school, the boys figured that he had needed\nthe time to adjust, though they had hoped he had not gone and done\nanything stupid. Mikey and a couple of the others that Bobby had\ncalled friends had actually sat with them at lunch and they all\ntalked and had a good time. Bobby and Donnie did have to take a few\ntaunts, but they just smiled and waved once again and just let it\ngo. The next morning Tommy was there for the day, and he was quiet\nall day and stayed to himself for the most part, but as soon as\nschool ended, he came up to Bobby and Donnie and asked to talk to\nthem. The boys steered all three of them to a quiet place to sit\nand talk. \u201cSo, what did you want to talk about, and how are you\nfeeling Timmy?\u201d Bobby asked. \u201cI think you know what, and the reason\nI didn't come to school yesterday was because my dad and I stayed\nhome all day talking. He stayed home from work as well and we just\ntalked all day long. When I got home the other day, he could tell\nsomething was wrong and asked me. I wouldn't tell him, because I\nthought he'd be really upset. Finally after dinner he made me tell\nhim what was wrong and I told him I thought I was gay. He just,\n'okay, that's fine with me,' and that was it. He did admit that\nhe's bi though, and I went to bed. Yesterday morning I woke up\nreally wet, my Goodnite leaked and everything, and my dad asked me\nif I was scared of being gay, so I told him yes.\u201d \u201cI started crying\nbecause I didn't want to be gay, I wanted to be normal, and he just\nhugged me, even though I was soaked. He laid me down on my bed and\nstripped me, washed me down and then put me into another one of my\nGoodnites, all while I was still crying. I tried to ask him why he\nput another Goodnite on me, but he told me not to talk yet. Then he\npicked me up and carried me to the living room and sat down and we\njust talked and talked all day long. He told me all about how he\nwas scared that he was gay when he was my age as well, how he\ndecided that he was bi instead, how he hid the gay side of himself,\nand how much it had hurt him to do so, but that he didn't want me\nto do the same thing. He told me how he'd suspected since I was\nfive or six that I was gay, and told me that he suspected that I\nwas totally gay, that I wouldn't enjoy being with a girl at all.\u201d\n\u201cI only cried more, because I had to admit to him that I'd tried\nlooking at pictures of girls on the computer, but they grossed me\nout, but not the pictures of the boys. He just laughed and told me\nthat he thought as much. I really don't want to be gay, but I think\nI am, and I enjoyed getting to wear my diaper all day long with my\ndad. He changed me two more times throughout the day, and when I\nasked him why he kept changing my diaper, he asked me if I really\nwanted him to answer that, so I said yes. He told me that he knew I\nwas a diaper lover as well and even asked me if I wanted real\ndiapers instead of the Goodnites. I'm pretty sure I blushed a lot\nat that, but I did say yes. I wasn't gonna lose the chance if he\noffered, even though I was really embarrassed.\u201d \u201cCongratulations\nTimmy, I bet you feel way better too.\u201d Bobby said, hugging his\nfriend lightly. \u201cYeah, I sorta do to tell you the truth, but I'm\nnot ready to do what you guys did and tell the whole school.\u201d\n\u201cThat's okay, no one said you had to. We had no choice, because\neven we could tell that there was no way we'd be able to hide what\nwe felt for each other, so we figured it was the lesser of two\nevils, and this way everyone can see we're not bothered by it.\u201d\nDonnie smiled. \u201cMakes sense, and even I could tell right away.\u201d He\ngiggled. \u201cYeah, but you're gay and your gaydar is probably already\nsomewhat active. Tell me, have you noticed any of our other friends\nthat might be gay?\u201d Bobby asked. \u201cYeah, I think Mikey is.\u201d \u201cSo do\nwe. Would you like him as a boyfriend?\u201d \u201cOh yeah, he's so freaking\ncute, and I'd totally love to see him in a soggy diaper too.\u201d He\ngrinned and blushed. \u201cSame here, but then, we wouldn't mind seeing\nyou like that either. Wanna come spend the night at our house on\nFriday night, we'll invite him as well and see where things lead?\u201d\nDonnie asked. \u201cThanks, I think. I don't know about spending the\nnight at your house, I've never spent the night anywhere before\nbecause of my bed wetting.\u201d \u201cYeah, but we wear diapers all the\ntime, and something else Preteen Underage Nymphet you'd find\nout about anyway, but so do our dads. When we're at home together,\nthat's about all we wear too.\u201d \u201cReally!\u201d \u201cOh yeah, and you'd get to\nas well. Maybe we can get Mikey into diapers as well. We'll arrange\nit all tomorrow, and then the next day we'll all spend the night\ntogether.\u201d Donnie smiled. \u201cOkay. I'll ask my dad, but he'll\nprobably say yes, because he keeps telling me that wetting the bed\nis no reason to not have sleepovers, especially with my Goodnites.\u201d\n\u201cExactly, so ask him tonight and we'll talk more tomorrow. We\nshould probably be heading home though, we want to go do our daily\nworkout and then we have to start dinner soon.\u201d \u201cOh, okay. I\nthought you were looking better, you've been working out?\u201d \u201cThanks,\nyeah, we both have been. We have some small weights, a few other\nworkout things and a pool now to use, so it's really good. We're\nnot allowed to do heavy lifting yet, because it's not good for our\nbodies, but we do work quite hard, and it's already helping too.\u201d\n\u201cCool. You think I could come over and work out with you guys?\u201d\n\u201cDon't see any reason why not. Just call your dad and see if he'd\nallow it and then we'll go from there.\u201d Bobby smiled. \u201cCool,\nthanks.\u201d He grabbed a cell phone from the bottom of his backpack,\nturned it on, and then called his dad and asked. He must have said\nit was okay, because he smiled brightly and said goodbye. He\nexcitedly told the boys that he was allowed to stay until dinner\ntime and then come home, so the three boys headed out. Just as they\nwere about to leave the school yard, Mikey saw them and came over.\n\u201cWhat are you still doing here?\u201d Timmy asked him. \u201cI was actually\nwaiting for you to finish talking to Bobby and Donnie, because I\nwanted to talk to you.\u201d \u201cOh, well we're heading to their place,\nbecause I'm gonna go workout with them.\u201d \u201cOh, maybe tomorrow then,\nor you can call me tonight, but I'd rather talk in person.\u201d \u201cWhy\nnot see if you can come to our place and you can talk on the way?\u201d\nBobby said. \u201cNo thanks, it's sorta private.\u201d Mikey blushed. \u201cOh,\nokay, but what if I were to tell you that all three of us think\nyou're gay as well, and that we think that you think that Timmy is\ntoo and you maybe want to ask him to be your boyfriend?\u201d Bobby\ngrinned. \u201cHuh, what.\u201d Both Timmy and Mikey said at the same time.\n\u201cYou heard me. Go ahead and call home and then come to our place,\nall four of us can talk.\u201d \u201cOkay.\u201d He called his mom and asked, and\nshe said yes and to be home for dinner as well. All four of them\nheaded out right away and walked toward Bobby and Donnie's house.\nWhen they made it there, they all went out back. \u201cPool or workout\nequipment?\u201d Bobby asked. \u201cPool.\u201d Timmy and Mikey both answered.\n\u201cGood, we hoped you'd say that. This pool has a very strict dress\ncode though.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cThat you wear none.\u201d \u201cHuh, as in no swim\nsuits?\u201d Timmy gasped. \u201cThat's right, so come on, let's strip. Don't\nworry, we all have the same stuff between our legs and no one can\nPreteen Underage Nymphet see us. We're also allowed to swim\nnaked here and our dads won't mind, so you don't have to be\nafraid.\u201d Donnie said, he and Bobby were already stripping. The two\nnew boys just stared in shock as the two boys ended up standing\nthere in just their soggy diapers before them unashamedly. With a\ncough from Bobby, they both started stripping until they were\nstanding there in just their underwear. Both boys were wearing hot\nlooking boxer briefs that hugged their cute bodies very nicely, and\nshowed off the fact that they must have enjoyed seeing Bobby and\nDonnie in just their diapers. All four of them removed their last\nitems that were covering their bodies, and all four boys looked at\neach other appreciatively. All four of them were hard, and they\nwere all about the same size. All their foreskins were pulled\nalmost all the way back, and then Bobby happened to notice\nsomething about Mikey. \u201cMikey, you're circumcised, that's weird,\nmost kids our age aren't any more. Our dads both are, but they said\nthat's just because that's what they did when they were babies.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, apparently my mom wanted me cut, she said it was cleaner, so\nshe went and had it done. Whatever.\u201d He shrugged, but he had a\nrather large blush from admitting it as well. \u201cThat's okay, I'm\nsure it still feels good anyway.\u201d Donnie grinned. \u201cOh yeah.\u201d He\nsaid and then blushed more. \u201cThat's good. Well, let's go hop in the\npool and we'll talk as we work out.\u201d Bobby laughed. Bobby went and\nopened up the pool and put the ladder in, while Donnie grabbed the\npool weights and threw them in. They all hopped in the cool water\nand then started swimming around. After a good fifteen minute swim,\nthey all got into a circle and Bobby said he would lead, and while\nhe did that, they talked. \u201cSo, how long have you known you were gay\nthen Mikey?\u201d Bobby asked. \u201cDon't really know, sorta always did I\nguess. My mom says she's known since I was real young as well.\u201d\n\u201cSo, she knows about you then!\u201d \u201cYeah, I admitted to her a year ago\nthat I thought I was different than other boys, I always felt more\nlike a girl. She said she knew that already and asked me how all I\nfelt different. I told her that I just sorta always thought of my\nboy friends and wanted to see them naked, things like that. She\nasked me if I knew what gay was, and I said I thought I knew, so\nshe explained it all to me, and I admitted that I was pretty sure I\nwas, she said she was pretty sure I was as well. She admitted that\nshe's bi and what that meant, but I sorta already knew, because\nshe'd had men and women stay the night with her before, sometimes\none or two of each. She told me she's what's known as a swinger,\nshe likes sex.\u201d He laughed and blushed. \u201cCool. I've known I was gay\nfor a long time, so has Donnie, and we made Timmy admit it the day\nbefore yesterday.\u201d \u201cYeah, I know, I was around the corner when you\ndid it. I wanted to follow him home and ask him to be my boyfriend\nright then, but I knew why you guys didn't follow him Preteen\nUnderage Nymphet and thought that was a good idea. Then today I\ncould tell that he'd accepted it, so I wanted to ask him. So Timmy,\nwould you be my boyfriend?\u201d \u201cYes, but I have something to tell you\nfirst.\u201d \u201cOkay, what?\u201d He smiled brightly. \u201cWell, I'm a bed wetter\nand wear diapers to bed, and I sometimes like to wear diapers\nduring the day too.\u201d \u201cReally, that's sorta weird, but sorta cool\ntoo. I sometimes wet the bed, but not enough to have to wear\ndiapers to bed, only once a month or so. But I should tell you that\nI sometimes like to dress up a little girly, and I have a few girls\nclothes at home.\u201d \u201cReally, that's sorta weird, but sorta cool too.\nYou even wear girls panties?\u201d \u201cYeah, and they're pink too. I love\npink, and I'd wear pink to school every day if I could.\u201d \u201cNeat. If\nI let you dress me up like that, would you let me diaper you?\u201d\n\u201cSure.\u201d Mikey smiled brightly. \u201cWicked. Donnie and Bobby asked for\nme to spend the night here Friday night, and they were gonna ask\nyou to as well, would you like to, and we can all get diapered?\u201d\n\u201cSure, that'd be awesome. I've never spent the night at someone's\nhouse before, just in case I wet the bed. That'd be really\nembarrassing, but my mom told me that she'd buy me some Goodnites\nif I wanted to spend the night, so that no one would have to know.\nI wouldn't let her though.\u201d \u201cMaybe you should've, then you could've\nlearned to love diapers like I do.\u201d Timmy blushed. \u201cMaybe. What\nabout you guys? Something doesn't add up with you Bobby.\u201d Mikey\nasked. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d He asked. \u201cWell, last year you had no\naccidents at school or anything, now you say that your bladder\nfailed you and you have to wear diapers.\u201d \u201cThat's what everyone at\nschool needs to know, what they don't need to know though is that\nit was my choice it failed, and mostly because I just forget about\nit now. Same with Donnie, he and I are both diaper lovers and we\nchoose to wear diapers all the time. They're really comfortable and\nsuper handy too.\u201d Bobby admitted freely. \u201cThat's sorta what I\nthought. I admit I've wondered what it'd be like to wear diapers\nbefore, because I wet the bed of course.\u201d He grinned. \u201cRight. Our\ndads are diaper lovers too, and my dad told me that so many gay\nboys like diapers it's not even funny, and even lots of straight\nboys like them too, because they're so comfortable and handy. It's\nso nice to get to watch a whole movie and drink lots of pop and not\nhave to get up to go to the bathroom in the middle of it.\u201d \u201cThey\nare too, cool.\u201d \u201cYeah, and when you spend the night, you'll see it,\nbecause we don't wear anything over our diapers.\u201d \u201cWill you diaper\nme and make me wear nothing over it as well?\u201d He asked sheepishly.\n\u201cYes, but if you want to bring a cute pink pair of panties to wear\nover it, then we could probably allow that.\u201d Bobby grinned. \u201cI\ndon't know about that. I mean, wearing a diaper is one thing,\nwearing only a diaper though is another thing. And will you make me\nuse it?\u201d \u201cWe'd never make you do anything, and if you really want\nto wear a diaper, but would feel more comfortable wearing clothes\nover it, then so be it, but we won't be. Also, you use it only as\nmuch as you feel comfortable doing so. We don't poop in our\ndiapers, just pee, and I assure you, it's awesome.\u201d Donnie said\nreassuringly. \u201cOh, okay.\u201d They talked more and more as they worked\nout, just really getting to know each other really well. After a\ngood half an hour of working out, they just started swimming to\nhave fun. Finally they all hopped out of the pool and ran naked and\nwet into the house to dry off, after closing up the pool of course.\nOnce dry, they all headed to the boys' bedroom, where Bobby and\nDonnie diapered each other. \u201cAre you two gonna stay naked for now\n'til you have to go home, or are you gonna go grab your clothes and\nget dressed? I of course suggest naked.\u201d Bobby asked. \u201cYou would.\u201d\nMikey grinned. \u201cYou're pretty cute, and you have such a cute little\npeepee.\u201d Bobby giggled. \u201cThanks, yours isn't so bad either.\u201d He\ngiggled as well. \u201cThanks. We should probably go get something out\nof the freezer for dinner and then we can go play games or\nsomething.\u201d They all headed to the kitchen, Mikey and Timmy opting\nto just stay naked, but they did go out and grab their clothes so\nthat they had them for when it was time to go home. They then all\nheaded to the living room and they put on a four player game and\nthey all had fun for the next forty or so minutes before the boys\nhad to be heading home. They went and grabbed their clothes from\nthe kitchen and got dressed. \u201cThanks so much guys, I'll definitely\nask my mom tonight if I can stay Friday night, but she'll say yes.\u201d\nMikey said. \u201cAnd I'll ask my dad about Friday night as well, so\nI'll let you know tomorrow at school. Can we come over tomorrow\nafter school as well?\u201d \u201cSure, both of you can, just ask your\nparents tonight as well and then we'll all come here right after\nschool.\u201d Bobby smiled. He had never had friends come over after\nschool or anything, and he liked it. As soon as Timmy and Mikey\nleft, Bobby and Donnie got started on dinner and had it ready for\nas soon as their dads walked in the door. They sat down to eat and\nthe boys excitedly told the dads about their day and what had\nhappened after school. They were proud of the boys and said so.\nThey all relaxed for the evening and went to bed at their regular\ntimes, and after a little playtime, they all went to sleep. The\nnext day at school, only one of their regular group was not sitting\ntogether at lunch, he had been the main one to spread around that\nBobby and Donnie were gay babies, and he was not ready to face them\nyet. They knew it was him, and they knew he was ashamed, but they\nlet him stew on it. He would come to them when he was ready, until\nthen they just let him be. The rest though were all good with the\nboys being gay and having to wear diapers, and the other boy that\nhad spilled their secret had already admitted and apologized for\ndoing so, but said he had done it not out of Preteen Underage Nymphet spite\nand more out of shock. They all had a great day at school, and\nbefore they knew it, the four boys were heading to Bobby and\nDonnie's house. \u201cWe need to change our diapers, and then we'll do a\ndifferent workout today. Would either of you like a diaper?\u201d Bobby\nasked. \u201cPlease.\u201d Timmy said meekly. \u201cOkay, I'll wear one too if\nTimmy does.\u201d \u201cOkay.\u201d Bobby said brightly and all four of them\nstripped bare. Timmy was diapered first, then Mikey, Bobby and\nfinally Donnie. Both new boys felt the front of their thick soft\ndiapers, they liked it, and then because both of them had to pee,\nthey did so right away. Bobby and Donnie enjoyed seeing this. Once\nthey were all diapered, they all stood there and looked at each\nother. \u201cYou two look really nice like that.\u201d Bobby smiled. \u201cAnd it\nlooks as if you've already enjoyed your nice thick thirsty baby\ndiapers.\u201d Donnie added, both boys blushed. \u201cDon't be embarrassed,\nwe have too, see.\u201d Bobby said while pointing to the wet spots on\nboth his and Donnie's diapers, both boys looked, and they could see\nit as well. \u201cSo, how do they feel?\u201d Donnie asked. \u201cReal nice, these\nare way better and more comfortable than the Goodnites. After one\ngood wetting I already have to change almost, two is about all I\ncan do in them. The Underjams were better though, not sure why my\ndad usually gets me the Goodnites when I told him that.\u201d \u201cAnd I\nreally like how they feel. I might have to wet my bed a few more\ntimes and ask my mom for these, these are awesome. They feel so\nnice when wet too.\u201d Mikey grinned brightly. \u201cGood, glad you guys\nenjoy. So, let's go do our workout then.\u201d So they headed out to the\nback yard and got started on their workout and worked for a little\nunder an hour, all four of them working up a good sweat. Finally\nthey decided to call it a day and headed into the house to give\nthemselves a quick wipe off and then went and played games for\nabout an hour before the boys had to head home. It was getting\nclose to that time when both said that they should get going. \u201cYour\ndiapers will still hold lots more. Would you like to just wear them\nhome, or are you gonna change out of them?\u201d Donnie asked. \u201cI better\nchange.\u201d Mikey said. \u201cI'm gonna keep mine on, my dad already knows\nI'm a diaper lover anyway.\u201d Timmy smiled. \u201cThen I'll keep mine on\ntoo. My mom probably won't even notice.\u201d \u201cCool.\u201d The two boys went\nand got dressed, and considering their clothes had not been bought\naround hiding diapers, both Bobby and Donnie could tell with expert\neyes that the other two were diapered, but they figured most would\nnot notice, and even though they felt the boys' parents would, they\nfelt that they should not tell the boys this. Timmy's dad would be\nfine anyway, but Mikey's mom would probably notice and say\nsomething. As soon as the two of them left, Bobby and Donnie got\nstarted on making dinner, and once again it was done as soon as the\ndads walked in. They all sat down to eat, and then the boys had a\nPreteen Underage Nymphet little homework to do, so got that\ndone, then joined their dads in watching TV for the rest of the\nnight. Once again they all went to bed and played for a bit before\ngoing to sleep for the night. The following day was an almost exact\nrepeat of the day before at school, and finally the day was over.\nThe four boys headed to Bobby and Donnie's, all of them hoping to\nhave a great night. As they walked there, they talked. \u201cMy dad\nnoticed that I was diapered quite heavily when he got home. He\nlaughed and asked me where I got the diaper, so I told him that you\nguys gave it to me and that you were diaper lovers as well.\u201d \u201cOh\nyeah, what'd he say to that?\u201d Bobby asked. \u201cHe just laughed and\nsaid it figured. He didn't have a problem with it and asked if\nthose were the diapers I wanted him to buy me, and I said for sure.\nHe checked it out and found out the brand and then did some\nresearch to find where to get them, then went out after dinner and\nbought me a couple cases of them. I almost wore one to school\ntoday, but I just couldn't do it.\u201d \u201cIt'll happen, don't worry.\u201d\nBobby laughed. \u201cDon't know.\u201d \u201cAnd did your mom notice you wearing\nthe diaper as well Mikey?\u201d Donnie asked. \u201cYeah, she did. She asked\nme why it looked like I was wearing a diaper, and I said because I\nam. She asked why that was and I told her my friends were diaper\nlovers and that you had asked me if I wanted to try one, so I\nadmitted to her that I did, and that I was diapered. She asked what\nI thought of it and I told her it was sorta nice. She told me that\nmy father had been a diaper lover as well and often wondered if I'd\nend up loving them as well.\u201d \u201cReally, that's cool. What happened to\nhim?\u201d \u201cHe died when I was two.\u201d \u201cSorry. What about your mom Timmy?\u201d\n\u201cTook off after I was born. She didn't want the burden. My dad says\nshe was a bitch anyway and wasn't even sure why the hell he was\nwith her in the first place, so no big loss. How about you guys?\u201d\n\u201cClose to the same as yours actually.\u201d Bobby said. \u201cAnd my dad just\ntold my mom that he didn't love her any more and wanted to break\nup, that he wanted to keep the baby, and I've never seen her since.\nWe left her when I was almost one he said.\u201d \u201cSo, we're really all\nthe same then. So, did you bring panties as well Mikey?\u201d Bobby\nasked. \u201cYeah, four pairs, in case I can talk you two into trying\nsome on as well.\u201d \u201cThought you might, and we might too, but only\nover my diaper. I like pink too, but my favorite color is purple.\u201d\nHe grinned. \u201cI like pink too, but my favorite is red.\u201d Donnie\nadded. \u201cI actually don't even like pink at all, I think it's almost\nas bad as bright yellow, my favorite's blue.\u201d Timmy said last. \u201cOh,\nI don't have any other colors, sorry. If you want to wear one, then\nyou'll have to suffer with pink.\u201d \u201cThat's okay, I'll try one on,\nbut only over my diaper as well.\u201d \u201cSame.\u201d Donnie and Mikey grinned.\nThey made it home a few minutes later, and decided to just head\nright in and diaper each other and forgo the workout. This was\nafter all a sleepover, they were supposed to be for fun, and they\nwanted to get diapered and start their fun right away. They all\nstripped right down, all of them were hard, and then they diapered\neach other, couples changing each other, even though the two\ntechnically weren't a couple yet, since they had yet to couple.\nMikey then grabbed the panties out of his bag and handed them out,\nand all four of them slipped them up over their already wet\ndiapers. Bobby took one look at them all and started giggling,\nwhich of course set them all off. \u201cThis looks ridiculous, even more\nso than just wearing diapers.\u201d He giggled more. \u201cYeah, it does.\u201d\nThey all said. \u201cWell, I think you're all hot like this.\u201d Mikey\nsaid, looking as if he were about to spontaneously cum. Timmy must\nhave seen this too, because he went up to Mikey, gave him a kiss\nand petted his hot little diaper lump for just a second, and Mikey\nexploded. It took several minutes for the cute little baby boy to\ncome down, and when he did, he sighed and smiled. \u201cWow, that was\nnice, thanks.\u201d Mikey said dreamily. \u201cYeah, it was.\u201d Timmy sighed.\nBobby and Donnie just smiled. \u201cOkay, what should we do guys?\u201d\nDonnie asked. \u201cLet's go play out in the back yard.\u201d Mikey smiled.\n\u201cOkay.\u201d The other three said as one, so they went out back and\nplayed. They played outside for a good two hours, all four of them\nhaving fun running and chasing each other, wrestling, tickling,\ntackling, whatever, they just had fun. The dads managed to make it\nhome before the boys even realized what time it was, and they stood\non the back porch watching the four boys having fun. They had to\nlaugh at what they were all wearing though, but thought that the\nboys looked really cute like they did as well. It was Timmy that\nhappened to notice the men standing there, and he screamed, \u201cOh my\ngod, we're being watched.\u201d As he was diving for some sort of cover.\nThe other three looked up, Mikey blushed, but Bobby and Donnie ran\nup to their dads. \u201cHi Daddy.\u201d They both yelled and jumped into\ntheir dads arms and hugged them. \u201cHi our little baby boys. It seems\nwe've embarrassed your friends though. I had no idea you'd have\nthem both in diapers already, and what's with the pink panties?\u201d\nBilly said. \u201cThese are Mikey's, he's the blond one, he loves\npanties and other girls clothes and loves pink, so we all agreed to\nwear them over our diapers. Not a huge fan of them myself, but why\nnot right.\u201d Bobby giggled. \u201cWhy not. Come on over boys and\nintroduce yourselves.\u201d Danny smiled. It took a couple minutes, but\nfinally both boys came over, both of them blushing madly, neither\nof them looking at the men. \u201cMaybe you two should strip down to\njust your diapers as well, that way they won't feel so embarrassed.\nThey know you wear already, but I think maybe they need to see it.\u201d\nDonnie suggested. \u201cOkay.\u201d They both said and started to strip right\naway. Both boys watched furtively, wondering if they really were\ndiapered and secretly wanting to see them in just their diapers.\nThey found out only a few seconds later that it was true, and the\nsecret really was not so much a secret as the two shy boys would\nhave liked to think it was, because all four of the others could\nsee how curious they were. The men stood there for several moments,\njust letting the boys look at them, even though they were trying\nnot to let it look like they were showing off, just like the boys\nwere trying not to let it show that they were looking, it was cute.\n\u201cSee, we're all alike here boys. We're all gay, we all love\ndiapers, though one of you I understand hasn't really had all that\nmuch chance yet to truly love them, but are well on the way to\ndoing so. So go ahead and look at us, we don't bite, at least not\nyou guys.\u201d Billy grinned. \u201cHuh.\u201d Timmy said, not sure what to make\nof that last part. \u201cWe like to nibble on each other, it's quite\nenjoyable. You two will probably enjoy that too before too long,\nbut don't rush it either.\u201d Danny smiled. \u201cOh.\u201d Both boys said, once\nagain blushing more. \u201cWe see that you boys didn't get a chance to\nstart dinner, so we're gonna head in and get that started right\nnow. You boys go ahead and stay out here playing and we'll call you\nin once it's ready.\u201d Billy said. \u201cOkay Daddy, thanks.\u201d The men\nturned around and headed back into the house and got started on\ndinner. As they did, they of course Preteen Underage\nNymphet talked. \u201cThey're adorable, aren't they?\u201d Billy\nsighed. \u201cYeah. Don't you wish you were their age again?\u201d\n\u201cDefinitely. And pink panties as well, that was a bit of a\nsurprise. Neither of our boys are at all girly, but the blond one,\nMikey I think it was, sure is. My god is he ever a pretty boy.\u201d\n\u201cTell me about it. It was cute though, and seeing their reaction,\nand I guess it's Timmy, seeing him dive behind Preteen Underage\nNymphet that chair was hilarious.\u201d \u201cNo shit, the look on his\nface was priceless and I'll probably remember it forever.\u201d He\nlaughed. The men continued talking as they made dinner. As soon as\nit was ready, they called the boys in to come and eat. As soon as\nthe men turned and went inside, Bobby and Donnie went to comfort\ntheir two friends, who were still more than a little embarrassed to\nhave been caught so vulnerable. \u201cIt's okay you two. As you clearly\nsaw, we're all the same here, we weren't embarrassed, even though\nwe were caught wearing girls panties. Our dads are really open, and\nyou can tell or show them anything and I bet they just say it's\ngreat. And you saw them in diapers too, which by the way, we all\nsaw how much you liked seeing them in just their diapers too. So,\nthere's no need to be embarrassed.\u201d Bobby said softly. \u201cYeah, and\nthey looked real nice like that too, but it was a bit of a shock to\nsee them standing there watching us, and still having anyone know\nanything about me is weird. Most of the kids at school would call\nme a freak if they knew.\u201d Timmy said. \u201cHmm, we haven't been called\nfreaks yet, at least that we've heard, but so what even if they\ndid. I bet most of the kids there are just as freaky as we are in\nsome way or another. Though my dad says that most kids our age\ndon't really understand all their feelings yet, even though we're\nalready starting to feel them by the time we're eight. And you know\nwhat, we don't mind that some of the kids have called us gay\nbabies, because you know what else, you can't be upset about the\ntruth. Now if someone were to start harassing us, then it might be\na different story, but we'd survive and just tell them off. If you\ndon't let them bother you, then they won't bother you.\u201d Donnie\nsaid. \u201cYeah, I guess that's true.\u201d They sat around in a circle on\nthe lawn just talking until they were called into dinner, Timmy and\nMikey both getting out a lot of their feelings about themselves,\nand they felt better for it. Finally they were called into dinner,\nand when they walked in, they wore happy smiles and were not\nembarrassed in front of the men. They were congratulated, and then\nthey all ate dinner. That night the six of them sat around in just\ntheir diapers after getting changed after dinner, and they all\nrelaxed and watched a movie. When bedtime came, all four boys slept\nin the boys' queen bed and talked until really late, then fell fast\nasleep. It was officially the best time they had ever had with\nother kids. The following morning they all met in the kitchen for\nbreakfast, and then it was decided to go out and swim and workout\nfor a bit. The two new boys never even batted an eye as they all\nstarted stripping off their diapers in the kitchen, so that they\ncould go swim. Being seen in diapers was way more embarrassing than\nbeing seen naked. The men checked out the two cute little boys and\nsmiled warmly to them and told them they had\nRelated post: Pthc\nHussyfan Lolita, Preteen Nude Toplist,\nLolita Toplist\nPreteen, Lolita\nSex Stories, Preteen\nModels Nn, Hussyfan Preteen, Lolita Top Sites, Preteen Nude, Elweb Lolita, Young Lolita Cp, Underage Preteen Sex, Bbs Lolitas, Preteen Underwear, Preteen Lolita Sites,\nLolita Underage\nNude, Lolita\nRape, Lolita\nPhotos, Nn\nLolita, Preteen\nModels Photos, Lolita Porn"
