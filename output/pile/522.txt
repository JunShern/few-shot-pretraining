Here are some of my thoughts.\n\nTotal Pageviews\n\nMonday, October 28, 2013\n\nI got my @$$ handed to me in the boxing ring. Forgive the vulgarity, but it is the only way to adequately describe what occurred.\n\nWhen a sergeant from my department asked me if I would be interested in participating in an exhibition boxing match for charity against a female commander from another jurisdiction, I happily agreed. The words \u201ccharity\u201d and \u201cexhibition\u201d drowned out the words \u201cboxing match\u201d in my head. I was expecting oversized clown gloves and putting on a fun show for the crowd. I couldn\u2019t have been more wrong.\n\nI heard much trash talking from the other side of the county but I really thought it was just hype to generate ticket sales for the event.\n\nSince I\u2019d never boxed before, I sought out a boxer, MMA fighter and overall \u201cbadass\u201d to help me with some basics so I would, at the very least, punch and move properly. In hindsight, I should have trained much earlier than 2 weeks out because my opponent was doing just that.\n\nWhen I stepped into that ring, I was prepared to entertain the crowd.When she threw the first punch into my face, I knew it wasn\u2019t for fun.Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face, right?I don\u2019t remember much from my bout.In fact, my trainer was apparently screaming from my corner telling me to \u201cget out\u201d and \u201cblock\u201d and I can honestly say I didn\u2019t hear a word.I never felt pain, either.I could see her fists coming at my face and I knew she was making contact, but it didn\u2019t hurt at all in the moment.That\u2019s the beauty of adrenaline.\n\nI\u2019ve been fortunate enough to be able to talk myself out of a lot of fights over the course of my career. For the ones I couldn\u2019t, the scenario always ended the same way: the bad guy ended up in handcuffs. If I started alone in a fight, I knew there were more of my brothers and sisters in blue on the way to assist. In the ring, I couldn\u2019t call for back up. At one point, she hit me so hard that I reverted back to my police training and I instinctively turned to find cover. In a ring, there is nowhere to go but back into the fight.\n\nI held my own. I stayed on my feet. I endured 3 rounds. I lost by majority decision. But I learned a few things for which I am grateful.\n\nThe first of which is to be prepared. I think if I\u2019d have taken this bout as serious as my opponent, I might have prevailed in at least one of the rounds. I have no one to blame but myself for making the assumption that this was a game. Those who prepare don\u2019t need luck. They win because they put in the time on the front end so they are ready for the moment.\n\nThis isn\u2019t as much about boxing as it is about life. For police officers, you can never know when you will find yourself in a dark alley with a bad guy who is ready to sacrifice it all to get away and hurt you in the process. You must train for those moments where life meets circumstance. Train for the unpredictable so you get to control the outcome. Those who are unprepared will find themselves wishing they\u2019d have trained harder for the fight that really matters - if they live to tell about it.\n\nFor those who don\u2019t face criminals in dark alleys, life it still about preparation. It\u2019s about committing yourself to constant self improvement. Take the classes you\u2019ve been putting off, read the book that will make you better at what you do, start training your body. Take on a new challenge that moves you out of your comfort zone because when you come out on the other side, you will be better. Never miss an opportunity to improve yourself because you can never know when it will pay off.\n\nThat was my second lesson. I had never boxed before and as the fight grew near, I was legitimately terrified. But I committed to the event and I asked myself the question I ask every time I get nervous about an upcoming challenge: \u201cWhat is the worst thing that could happen?\u201d I came up with the following answers: I could lose. I could get publicly humiliated in the process. I could actually get hurt.\n\nThe funny part is that getting hurt played the least part in the equation. I\u2019m not sure why but I\u2019m not scared of getting injured or being in pain. I\u2019ve endured pain before and I know it\u2019s temporary. I wasn\u2019t even particularly worried about losing. I knew going into this bout that my opponent was bigger and stronger and thus, I had no delusions or false confidence. So public humiliation was the only lingering barrier and I figured I could live with that! Once I formulated the answers to the questions and accepted the worst case scenario, I was able to move forward.\n\nI stepped far outside my comfort zone and in the moment, it really sucked. I wanted to revert back to my safe place. But I\u2019m glad I stayed in and endured. And now that I\u2019m on the other side, I\u2019m better for having done it. Even with the loss and the humiliation. I\u2019m better because I tried.\n\nPhoto by Ed Corral Photography\n\nI couldn\u2019t give up because it would render pointless every lesson I\u2019ve ever taught my children about failure and resilience. Much of life is showing up and if you end up taking a beating, that\u2019s okay as long as you get up again. It\u2019s about perseverance and staying in the fight.\n\nAnd finally, I learned that the people in your corner are the ones who matter most of all.\n\nThe actual fight is a blur to me but one thing I do recall is looking out to see the faces of my friends and family cheering me on.The ones who showed up are the ones who will still be there without a winning title and when the rest of the crowd goes away, they\u2019re still in my corner. They don\u2019t make trophies for that.\n\nWednesday, October 23, 2013\n\nI entered this profession in 1991 at a time when it was progressive enough that women in policing had already secured a place, but not progressive enough that women held leadership positions. In my state, we were accepted into the thin blue line but we would maintain our positions within that line for awhile and not out in front leading the line.\n\nBy the very nature of human adaptation, we sought to \u201cfit in\u201d so much so that we bartered away our uniqueness for a place at the table. When I was a brand new police officer, I acted the way I thought I was supposed act and I emulated those around me.\n\nThis was a stretch from the person I actually was. I was a chubby kid throughout my childhood and I\u2019m kinda grateful for my parent\u2019s lack of knowledge about nutrition because with every slice of pizza I shoved into my face, I learned to be funny to compensate for my husky waistline. The summer before my senior year of high school, I discovered exercise and health and lost the weight. But I was still funny. I was voted \u201cClass Clown\u201d by my fellow classmates because I had mastered quick-wit and humor as a way to draw others in. I was usually the loudest person in the room, and quite frankly, I don\u2019t know how to be any other way.\n\nSo when I fulfilled my dream of becoming a cop, I stifled that part of me and applied my proverbial mask that I dubbed my \"street personality\u201d. My small stature magnified my insecurity so I overcompensated by being over the top.\n\nI used to believe that this phenomenon was exclusive to women but I\u2019ve since realized that it is not gender-specific. We all spend much of our time watching social cues and emulating others so we don\u2019t stand out too much. We are innately designed so that we adapt to our environment.\n\nFor the first year on the job, I was a poser. I pretended to be tough and I talked a big game. That is, until a criminal-type ran from me on a traffic stop. I got a much needed lesson that my skills and stature were nothing against a 6\u20193\u2019\u201d muscle-man. I gave chase but failed to consider my gift of being pretty fast when I needed to be. As the gap between he and I was closing, I recall having the semi-conscious thought: \u201cWhat am I going to do when I catch him?\u201d\n\nSo I formulated a plan to to pounce and tackle him to the ground, then cuff him. I got within 3 feet and sprung on him with Tigger agility and grabbed his shoulders.\n\nBut.he.didn\u2019t.fall. His footing wasn\u2019t in the least bit affected by my acrobatic feat.\n\nI didn\u2019t have a \u201cplan B\u201d because it never occurred to me that my \u201cplan A\u201d would be thwarted by physics. I never made a conscious decision to hang on to him - it just happened. So as I was riding this guy\u2019s back through the backyardsof a neighborhood on the east side of Aurora, my \u201ctough guy\u201d act fell away and I said to him:\n\n\u201cWe both know you could really hurt me if you wanted to. But you won\u2019t -- because it won\u2019t increase your street cred given my obvious proportion. And it certainly won\u2019t help my reputation among my fellow officers. So let\u2019s just end this and I\u2019ll arrest you for your warrants which is inevitable sooner or later anyway. I won\u2019t charge you with fleeing and we\u2019ll call it a day.\u201d\n\nHe stopped. Just like that, he stopped abruptly. I slid down his back and handcuffed him with no issue whatsoever.\n\nHe said, \u201cMa'am, no one has ever been real with me like that.\u201d\n\nHe also said, \u201cYou dropped something back there\u201d which turned out to be my radio that had bounced out of it\u2019s holder. So we walked together and he showed me where I dropped it (no kidding). I picked it up and said in my most confident voice over the air, \u201cSubject in custody\u201d.\n\nI ran into that guy many times throughout my career and he never gave me a problem. He gave other cops a problem -- but not me.\n\nAfter that incident, I started being me. I brought MY personality to my job and I started making great successes. I learned that when you treat people with dignity and respect and never look down on them (even when they are literally laying in the gutter), they will cooperate and even help you.\n\nI was a successful police officer because I stopped trying to be what I believed I was supposed to be and started being authentic. I diffused situations with humor and I didn\u2019t withhold compassion like I thought I was supposed to do. I was me.\n\nThen I got promoted to sergeant and the same thing happened again. I started acting the way my bosses over the years acted because I thought that was how authority was supposed to look. Fortunately, I was conscious of it and I forced myself to remember the lesson I learned 9 years earlier.\n\nIt\u2019s a struggle to go against the \u201cnorm\u201d and it\u2019s much easier to attempt to live in the contrived notion of what others believe a Chief, a Captain, a Lieutenant, a President, a Board Member (insert any title here) should be.\n\nWhose template are we trying to fit? We should be more concerned with results. Are we getting the job done? That should be the litmus test and should matter more than anything else. What\u2019s wrong with adding personality to the process? When it\u2019s time to put our game faces on, we always do.\n\nIt\u2019s so counter-intuitive but the fact is that when we start using the skills and the gifts that are unique to us (humor, passion, compassion, creativity) -- when we begin being more of who we really are -- this authenticity makes us better at leading people. It does so because we aren\u2019t borrowing power from our position. It does so because we don\u2019t have to try and remember to be a different person at work. Humans aren\u2019t built to compartmentalize the different facets of our lives. I\u2019m always astounded when people tell me they are a different person at home than they are at work. That must be exhausting to try and remember who to be based on where you are!\n\nI know what stops us from being who we really are. We are worried what will \"THEY\" will think. What will EVERYONE think?\n\nThe best moment of my life came after I finally asked myself, \u201cWho is this THEY that I\u2019m so worried about and why do I give them so much power?\u201d The answer is actually really simple. I keep a list of the \u201cthey\u2019s\u201d in my life whose opinion really matters to me. I call them my \u201cPersonal Board of Directors\u201d and they are comprised of my family, friends, and mentors with strong values and high expectations of me. When I begin to worry or the criticism starts to get to me, I refer to my list and as long as I\u2019m doing right by them, the noise falls away.\n\nIf there is a time where I know that my \u201cTHEY\u201d would not be proud, I know that I have to make some changes.\n\nAnd if you find yourself on the other side as one of the critics or the one who stands in judgement, stop. Check yourself. Be introspective enough to question your own judgments of others and instead of criticizing, seek understanding. I have found that my biggest critics are usually people who don\u2019t even know me.\n\nYou are never going to satisfy all the critics (especially the higher you ascend in an organization). That\u2019s okay -- that\u2019s where COURAGE comes in. You could be the ripest, juiciest apple in the world, and there\u2019s going to be someone out there who hates apples.\n\nThere are those moments when I struggle and am tempted to fall prey to the criticism that suggests I don\u2019t act (or even look) \u201cCommanderly\u201d. And then I think of the men and women in my department and the results they produce and the relationships I have with them that are based on mutual respect and I realize I\u2019m doing something right. I\u2019ve gotten this far in my career by being me and I\u2019m proud of that. And I\u2019m not going to change to fit someone else\u2019s template.\n\nWe all need to find the courage to be authentic and even vulnerable at times. Vulnerability is not for the weak -- it\u2019s for the strong. It takes courage to stand out because it\u2019s much easier (and safer) to fit in.\n\nYou will have critics and people will judge you but as long as you are right with the \u201cthey\u201d in your life and as long as you are doing the right thing, for the right reasons, and at the right time, you should be YOU as much as you possibly can.\n\nThursday, October 10, 2013\n\nDo you think leaders should be loved or feared? This leadership question has been debated over the years with different surveys and trends that reveal many opinions on the matter.\n\nSome believe that fear is a motivator and that people, when left to their own devices, will not perform without the threat of discipline or punishment. Instilling fear then, is a motivator unto itself. The fearful leader rules with an iron fist and order is achieved through the genuine belief that discomfort will result should they not perform. Police officers can sometimes fall back on their position of authority and use their badge to motivate through fear. Parents do this by using the \u201cBecause I said so\u201d approach.\n\nThe problem with being feared is that people don\u2019t develop intrinsic motivation to perform (motivation that comes from within us). When people perform out of fear, they soon become resentful and that results in a revolt against authority over time. When a police officer instills fear when they could have used influence, defiance occurs.\n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum is the leader who is loved. This leader gains the admiration of his or her people based on affection. This leader typically craves being looked upon favorably by those they lead.\n\nA leader who is loved may become so accustom to the feeling of admiration that it clouds their thinking. It feels good to be loved and it\u2019s easy to get caught up in the warm and fuzzy throes of positive emotion. As result, the loved leader will make decisions based on the need to hold onto that feeling and thus, will attempt to appease their people rather than risk upsetting them. The consequence is that these loved leaders will soon turn to others to make the tough decisions so they don\u2019t have to be the \u201cbad guy\u201d. In parenthood, this results in being more of a friend than a parent.\n\nMany say that leaders should be both loved and feared. I disagree and argue that they should be neither. Instead, they should be respected.\n\nRespect is born out of high regard and is elicited by a persons abilities, qualities and achievements. It is an esteemed reverence for skill but the overarching characteristic for respecting a leader is based on reciprocity. That is, they genuinely hold their people in high regard and honor them for their contribution to the organization.\n\nLeaders who are respected follow a simple formula when making any decision -- whether it be about policy or personnel:\n\nAm I doing the the right thing, at the right time, and for the right reasons?\n\nIf the answer to any component of this question is \u201cno\u201d, they re-evaluate and formulate a response that is in proper alignment.\n\nA respected leader will always be able to give transparent reasons for the decision they made and will never feel ambushed or insulted when asked to do so. A respected leader understands that they will not please everyone all of the time and makes peace with that concept because they have followed the formula.\n\nI firmly believe that you can buy a person\u2019s back, but you cannot buy their heart. Quite simply, I can force someone to do what I want by threat of punishment (fear) and that method will be effective; but only in the short term.\n\nHowever, when the heart is fully engaged and people believe that they are valued and respected, they will perform because their purpose and their passion persuades them to do so. It takes time to build an environment where values and expectations are communicated clearly and where people are appreciated for their skills. This is no easy feat because it requires honest and open dialogue and transparent policies with constant communication.\n\nPerhaps we shouldn\u2019t focus on the leaders at all. Maybe the answer is finding the \u201cwhy\u201d in what we do so that we perform not for someone but for something bigger than ourselves.\n\nAbout Me\n\nI am the Chief of the Aurora Police Department in Illinois.\nI hold a Bachelor\u2019s Degree in Criminal Justice from Aurora University and a Master\u2019s Degree in Criminal Justice Management from Boston University.
