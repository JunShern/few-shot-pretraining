The drying period is critical to effective treatment, restoration of aerobic conditions, and maintenance of infiltration rates. The length of time required to dry each basin of visible water should be recorded, and any increasing trend in required drying time should be noted. An increase in the necessary drying time can signal the need for basin surface maintenance. Such maintenance can include disking, scarifying (tilling or breaking up the surface), or scraping off surface solids."
