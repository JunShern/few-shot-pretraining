Now I want OS X back but I can't install it considering I have no access to Mac OS X. I need either an OS X Snow Leopard or OS X Lion .iso so I can put it on an installer USB.\n\nA:\n\nSince OS X Lion was around $30 USD on release you definitely, definitely wouldn't want to torrent the .iso. I would image you could find the torrent fairly easily if you were to look. But you wouldn't do that, would you, because that would be immoral and possibly illegal in your area.\n\n"
