Hire a professional interior designer\n\n24th April 2018\n\n0 Comment(s)\n\nWhether you\u2019ve just bought a new property, or are planning on selling, designing and decorating a whole home can be a mammoth task. Where do you start? What colours should you go for? And what fabrics will look fantastic? Most of all, how much will it all cost?\n\nHiring an interior designer can give you the talent, experience and perspective you need to help save you time, effort and money. From a resale point of view, homes that have had the touch of a talented professional are generally more attractive and easier to sell.\n\nBrands spend thousands of pounds trying to get the right look and feel for their products. Whole teams are dedicated to this process, from the product development and packaging design right through to the marketing. When your home is likely to be one of your biggest investments, it makes sense that your approach should be the same.\n\nAt Mood Interiors, we believe that hiring a professional interior designer can help sell your home for a higher price and more quickly. Here\u2019s why:\n\nBoost your home\u2019s appeal\n\nIn America, many home sellers realise the value of investing in interior design before they put their house up for sale. However, in the UK, this isn\u2019t necessarily the case. It only takes a quick glance at the online property portals to see lots of dreary houses for sale. Many of them are poorly decorated, unstyled and photographed in a bad light. An interior designer can make your home stand out from the crowd and cause people to stand up and take notice when they spot it for sale. What\u2019s more, when they come to view, they won\u2019t be disappointed.\n\nAccentuate the benefits\n\nInterior designers can work the space available to the best of its ability and are likely to spot plus points you might not have noticed. This will allow you to accentuate every benefit your property offers and potentially ask a higher price.\n\nCreate a coherent home\n\nA house that is a mishmash of styles, furniture and colours can be jarring on the eye and turn buyers off. That\u2019s why before putting it on the market, it\u2019s important to ensure that everything in your home flows together seamlessly. An interior designer can help you use styles, colours and patterns to help achieve this.\n\nFetch a higher price\n\nIt might sound odd, but the phrase \u2018spend money to make money\u2019 rings true when it comes to employing an interior designer to help sell your home. Not only will they be able to frame your home in the best light possible, they\u2019re likely to increase its perceived value. Overall, you\u2019re likely to see a real return on investment that pays the interior designer fee many times over.\n\nCreate a more universal look\n\nAs a home owner, it\u2019s easy to get caught up in the interiors that you love and suit your personality. But naturally, not all people will feel the same about your baroque wallpaper or family photo wall.\n\nGood interior designers aren\u2019t just skilled in creating interiors that suit your personality, they also have a knack for styling homes in a universally appealing way. Because you never know what people will like or dislike, this ability to create a show home vibe can be highly valuable and significantly broaden your pool of potential purchasers.\n\nAt Mood Interiors, we help people like you frame your home in the best light possible \u2013 whether you\u2019re selling or staying put. If you\u2019re looking to add that special something to your property, why not contact us?"
