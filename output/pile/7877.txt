    "text": "Quebec occultist Yacouba Fofana (a.k.a. Professor Alfoseny) did a pretty nifty magic trick for some clients: he made their money disappear. Any services he managed to conjure up in exchange were apparently invisible.\n\nBefore he himself could perform a vanishing act, though, he was charged under Canada\u2019s Criminal Code, with both fraud and \u2014 wait for it \u2014 witchcraft.\n\nPeople are shocked. In modern-day Canada, in the year 2014, you can actually be charged under an obscure provision of the Criminal Code with \u201cpretending to practice witchcraft.\u201d The law specifically targets\n\nEvery one who fraudulently (a) pretends to exercise or to use any kind of witchcraft, sorcery, enchantment or conjuration, (b) undertakes, for a consideration, to tell fortunes, or (c) pretends from his skill in or knowledge of an occult or crafty science to discover where or in what manner anything that is supposed to have been stolen or lost may be found\n\nThe charge is the equivalent of a misdemeanor with a maximum fine of $500 or a six-month jail term.\n\nThat the law appears as part of a larger section on \u201cFraudulent Practices\u201d has not been evident in headlines about the case, which trumpet \u201cFake medium faces sorcery charge\u2026 in Canada\u201d and mislead readers to think that Canada actually has a provision to prosecute witches\u2026 just like in the Salem Witch Trials or Monty Python.\n\nI play it off like a joke, but in some parts of the world (such as Papua New Guinea, India, and parts of Africa) prosecution of witches is not a far-off piece of history, and it\u2019s not something that targets fraudsters scamming the emotionally vulnerable. Rather, it\u2019s based on genuine beliefs that witchcraft exists and is an offense that society\u2019s deity expects to see punished.\n\nHeadlines like the ones being posted about Fofana\u2019s case take advantage of such injustices, which typically target vulnerable minority populations in the places where they occur, to muddy the waters in the name of clickbait.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: Canadian law enforcement is not exploiting a ridiculous and outdated law to charge Fofana. Nor are they expressing a sincerely-held belief that sorcery is real and worthy of punishment. Rather, they are charging Fofana with fraud using a section of the Criminal Code that specifically addresses charlatans who knowingly and intentionally defraud people through their supernatural claims.\n\nReligiousTolerance.org notes that\n\nThe law seems to be unevenly applied. Most newspapers contain advertisements by psychics; 900 lines are promoted on television; psychic fairs are periodically held in most large cities. One source estimates that there are in excess of 10,000 practicing psychics in Canada. Prosecutions are rare.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why this story is really interesting. Have all these psychics demonstrated sufficient belief in their own abilities to avoid prosecution? What does \u201csufficient belief\u201d look like, anyway? What about money-making schemes wrapped up in socially-sanctioned supernatural beliefs?\n\nAfter all, one reader\u2019s fraudulent practice is another\u2019s sacred cow. Exactly who gets to decide what gets prosecuted and what gets ignored?\n\n(via Doubtful News. Image via Shutterstock)\n\n\n\n"
