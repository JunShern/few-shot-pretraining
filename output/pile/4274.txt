    "text": "For black North Carolinians, the Great Recession never ended. From\n2009 to 2014, black residents\u2019 incomes plummeted 21 percent in\nWinston-Salem, 17 percent in Raleigh, and 15 percent in Charlotte and\nGreensboro.\n\nNorth Carolinians of other races aren\u2019t faring much better. In 2015,\nthe average North Carolina household earned $400 less than it did in\n2009, after adjusting for inflation.\n\nWages are stagnant or declining because blue-collar North Carolinians\nface excessive competition from foreign labor. By striking fairer trade\ndeals and lowering immigration, elected leaders could tighten the labor\nmarket. Employers would have to boost wages to attract workers.\n\nMany companies have shipped jobs overseas to take advantage of\ncheaper labor. From 2001 to 2011, America lost 3.2 million jobs to China\nalone. North Carolina \u2013 a former powerhouse in textile manufacturing \u2013\nhas suffered more from outsourcing than any other state, according to\nthe Labor Department.\n\nTo add insult to injury, many employers pass over local workers in favor of cheaper immigrant laborers.\n\nTwo dozen senior U.S. intelligence and military officers \u2013 who tried\nto warn George W. Bush before the Iraq war that those pushing war were\nlying \u2013 write:\n\nOur\nU.S. Army contacts in the area have told us this is not what\nhappened. There was no Syrian \u201cchemical weapons attack.\u201d Instead, a\nSyrian aircraft bombed an al-Qaeda-in-Syria ammunition depot that turned\nout to be full of noxious chemicals and a strong wind blew the\nchemical-laden cloud over a nearby village where many consequently died.\n\n****************************\n\nFormer U.N weapons inspector Scott Ritter warned before the start of\nthe Iraq war that claims that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass\ndestruction were false.\n\nSunday, Ritter wrote that current claims that the leader of Syria launched a chemical weapons attack was false.\n\n\u201cthose who hated him still hate him while those who supported him now also hate him\u201c.\n\nThe latest US cruise missile attack on the Syrian airbase is an\nextremely important event in so many ways that it is important to\nexamine it in some detail. I will try to do this today with the hope to\nbe able to shed some light on a rather bizarre attack which will\nnevertheless have profound consequences. But first, let\u2019s begin by\nlooking at what actually happened.\n\nOne-hundred and fifty-two years ago, April 9, 1865 was a Palm Sunday\njust as today, and in the central part of war-torn Virginia, a major\nturning point occurred in American history. General Robert E. Lee, that \u201cchevalier sans peur\u201c\u2014that\nknight without fear\u2014surrendered the tattered remnants of the proud Army\nof Northern Virginia to General Ulysses S. Grant, setting in motion the\nend phase of the War for Southern Independence.\n\nThat war was in reality not a \u201ccivil war,\u201d that is, it was not a war\nbetween two aggrieved parties within the American nation. Rather, it was\na war between two ideas of government, and, in reality, two ideas of\nhistory and progress. For the North, which now controlled the Federal\ngovernment, it was a war to suppress what was seen as a rebellion\nagainst constituted national authority. For the states of the Southern\nConfederacy, it was a defense of their inherited and inherent rights\nunder the old Constitution of 1787, rights that had never been ceded to\nthe Federal government. And, more, it became for them a Second War for\nIndependence against an arbitrary and overreaching government that had\ngravely violated that Constitution.\n\nChina has flexed its military muscle on state television as tensions escalate between the US and North Korea.\n\nChina Central Television (CCTV) yesterday revealed footage of the country's various missiles in a daily military programme.\n\nAccording\nto media, one of the weapons featured in the programme was DF-21\nmissile. The anti-ship ballistic missile boasts a firing distance of up\nto 1,926 miles (3,100km) and has been dubbed 'the killer of aircraft\ncarrier'.\n\nTrey Gowdy\u2019s office had no official statement but his top aide, Mandy\nGonsales, said that the committee isn\u2019t happy with the circumstances of\nMcGill\u2019s death or the fact that his own doctor was summoned to\npronounce. Abedin says she called the private doctor because she hoped\nhe could save her friend.\nThere will be no autopsy on the body, which will be cremated before\nsunset in accordance with his religion. McGill is the single son of\ndeceased parents and has no family. No services are planned.\n\nJust days after being summoned to appear before Trey Gowdy\u2019s\ncongressional committee to testify about Hillary Clinton\u2019s email server,\none of her aides was found dead at home of \u201cnatural causes.\u201d\n\nJohnston Wilson McGill, 34, was pronounced dead on his couch by a\nprivate doctor after suffering an apparent heart attack. A spokesman for\nClinton\u2019s former campaign said that Huma Abedin, Clinton\u2019s deputy\ncampaign coordinator, found McGill when she stopped by for coffee to\ndiscuss Clinton\u2019s plans for a run for Mayor of New York.\n\nAbedin told police in a statement that McGill suffered from an\nabnormal heart arhythmia and that his doctor had always said a sudden\nand massive cardiac event was a possibility. She also told her publicist\nto make sure that the whole world knew that he was planning to\ncooperate with the congressional panel.\n\nPresident Trump\nsigned into law the first major national pro-life bill in more than a\ndecade, freeing states to withhold federal family planning money from Planned Parenthood and other clinics that also perform abortions.\n\nThe Obama administration had issued a last-minute rule trying to prevent GOP-led\nstates from discriminating against abortion providers, insisting that\nall women\u2019s health clinics be treated the same. But Republicans, aided\nby Mr. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, have now erased that rule.\n\nA federal complaint\nwas unsealed today charging Candace Marie Claiborne, 60, of Washington,\nD.C., and an employee of the U.S. Department of State, with obstructing\nan official proceeding and making false statements to the FBI, both\nfelony offenses, for allegedly concealing numerous contacts that she had\nover a period of years with foreign intelligence agents.\n\nThe charges were\nannounced by Acting Assistant Attorney General Mary B. McCord for\nNational Security, U.S. Attorney Channing D. Phillips of the District of\nColumbia and Assistant Director in Charge Andrew W. Vale of the FBI\u2019s\nWashington Field Office.\n\n\u201cCandace Marie\nClaiborne is a U.S. State Department employee who possesses a Top Secret\nsecurity clearance and allegedly failed to report her contacts with\nChinese foreign intelligence agents who provided her with thousands of\ndollars of gifts and benefits,\u201d said Acting Assistant Attorney General\nMcCord. \u201cClaiborne used her position and her access to sensitive\ndiplomatic data for personal profit.\n\nPursuing those who imperil our\nnational security for personal gain will remain a key priority of the\nNational Security Division.\u201d\n\nThe House and Senate Intelligence Committees are expanding their\ninvestigations into former National Security Adviser Susan Rice's\nalleged \"unmasking\" of U.S. persons who were incidentally collected in\nsurveillance of foreign officials.\n\nAn unnamed member of the House Intelligence Committee confirmed that Rice is now under \"a full-blown investigation,\" Fox News reported on Wednesday.\n\n\"We will be performing an accounting of all unmasking for political\npurposes focused on the previous White House administration. This is now\na full-blown investigation,\" the committee member said.\n\nA Huffington Post blogger proposed Thursday to deny white men the\nright to vote for 20 years to correct the wrongs they afflicted on the\nworld.\n\nShelley Garland, a MA philosophy student, pondered taking away white men\u2019s voting powers\nas punishment for their \u201ctoxic white masculinity\u201d in an op-ed. Garland\nargues that if it hadn\u2019t been for white men, President Donald Trump\nwouldn\u2019t have been elected and the U.K. would still be a part of the\nE.U.\n\nThe only way to fix this, Garland reasons, is to take away white men\u2019s voting rights for about twenty years.\n\nThe new commander of South Korea's Marine Corps took office on\nThursday calling on his 30,000 troops to be ready to \"mercilessly\nretaliate\" against North Korea's provocations.\n\nIn a\nchange-of-commander ceremony, Lt. Gen. Jun Jin-goo pointed out that the\nelite forces have played a key role in the front-line defense of the\ncountry.\n\n\"The Marine Corps has protected places most difficult\nto defend but should be done so at all costs\" from Baengnyeong Island\nnear the western sea border with North Korea to Pohang, Ullleung Island\nand Jeju Island, he said in his speech at the event held the\nheadquarters of the Marine Corps in Hwaseong, Gyeonggi Province.\n\n\"The\njets of the so-called US-led coalition launched a strike at about\n17:30-17:50 [local time, 14:30-14:50 GMT] on a Daesh warehouse where\nmany foreign fighters were present. First a white cloud and then\na yellow one appeared at the site of the strike, which points at the\npresence of a large number of poisonous substances. A fire at the site continued until 22:30 [19:30 GMT],\"\n\nThe Syrian army yet again denied possessing chemical weapons. According to the Syrian General Staff, the US-led coalition's strike killed several hundred people, including civilians. Hundreds were poisoned as a result of the strike on Daesh's headquarters and depot with chemical weapons.\n\n\"This\nconfirms that Daesh and al-Nusra terrorists possess chemical weapons\nand are capable of using, obtaining and transporting it,\" the document\nsaid.\n\nFurthermore, if true, the US coalition just did exactly what Russia has claimed occurred in the initial chemical attack (that prompted President Trump's \"Tomahawk\" torrent). The Russian Defense Ministry said the day after the\ninitial chemical weapons release that an airstrike near Khan Shaykhun\nwas carried out by Syrian aircraft, struck a terrorist warehouse that\nstored chemical weapons slated for delivery to Iraq.\n\nOf course, the propaganda battle is not over so what we need now is some YouTube clip to 'prove' what the US coalition did.\n\nAbandoning his tough talk on China and reversing himself on several other campaign themes, President Trump\u2019s\n12th week in office could go down as the moment he showed himself to be\nanother establishment Republican, not the unconventional\ncrockery-smashing raging bull he played on the stump.\n\nIn the past week, Mr. Trump\nordered missile strikes against the Syrian military after telling\nvoters during the campaign that the U.S. was involved in too many\nmilitary operations overseas.Mr. Trump\nproclaimed Wednesday that NATO is no longer obsolete, after questioning\nthe U.S. commitment to the alliance on the campaign trail.\n\nAlso this week, Mr. Trump declared that he will not label China as a currency manipulator, after campaigning relentlessly on a promise to do just that.\n\n`\nNow, some 30 days after Napolitano broke the story, CNN seems to have just confirmed it:\n\nBritish and other European intelligence agencies intercepted\ncommunications between associates of Donald Trump and Russian officials\nand other Russian individuals during the campaign and passed on those\ncommunications to their US counterparts, US congressional and law enforcement and US and European intelligence sources tell CNN.\n\nThe communications were captured during routine surveillance\nof Russian officials and other Russians known to western intelligence.\nBritish and European intelligence agencies, including GCHQ, the British\nintelligence agency responsible for communications surveillance, were\nnot proactively targeting members of the Trump team but rather picked\nup these communications during what's known as \"incidental collection,\" these sources tell CNN.\n\nThe European intelligence agencies detected multiple\ncommunications over several months between the Trump associates and\nRussian individuals -- and passed on that intelligence to the US.\nThe US and Britain are part of the so-called \"Five Eyes\" agreement\n(along with Canada, Australia and New Zealand), which calls for open\nsharing among member nations of a broad range of intelligence.\n\nMr. Graham had predicted Mr. Trump\u2019s\nabout-face since last year, when as president-elect he intervened to\nsave hundreds of manufacturing jobs at the Carrier air conditioning\nplant in Indiana. The bank said it sends any surplus from the\ninterest and fees it assesses back to the Treasury, resulting in a $5.6\nbillion profit for taxpayers since fiscal 2007. That appeared to help sway the president.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s embrace of the Export-Import Bank is a major blow to conservatives, who had been on the verge of nixing what they \u2014 and Mr. Trump, until now \u2014 called a sop to wealthy corporations.\n\nDuring the election campaign, Mr. Trump\ndismissed the obscure lending agency as \u201cfeatherbedding\u201d for\npoliticians and huge companies that don\u2019t need it, enthusing opponents\nwho had squeezed its lending powers and said it should die off.\n\nBut\nthe president now says he is convinced that the corporate welfare\nproduces jobs \u2014 an about-face that irked conservatives who have been\nfighting for years to end the loan program.\n\n\u201cUnless the Trump\nadministration has reforms that can get Ex-Im out of the business of\npicking winners and losers with taxpayer dollars, then it will be\ndifficult to see any upside in this,\u201d said Doug Sachtleben, a spokesman\nfor the Club for Growth, a conservative group that urged Congress to let\nthe bank expire.\n\nThree weeks before voters head to the polls to choose the next president of France, all 11 first-round candidates lined up in\na large semicircle for a nationally televised debate that quickly\ndissolved into a cacophony of insults and shouts that steamed rapidly\nout of control.\n\nFor an American viewer, it was a Gallic clone of our own Republican primary debates a year before.\n\nA week after this televised contest, France's leading daily newspaper, Le Monde, asked,\n\"What would the first months of an Emmanuel Macron presidency look\nlike?\" -- effectively baptizing one of the two leading candidates the\nwinner even before the first ballot is cast.\n\nIt\nappeared to be a form of wishful thinking, not unlike the broad\nassumptions of most American newspapers in October that Hillary Clinton\nwas the presumptive heir to the presidency of the United States -- not Donald Trump.\n\nRemembrance\n\nTo die for one\u2019s country is not only an act of bravery, it is THE act of bravery. For soldiers, it is just an extension of their military career, a part of their duty. As leaders have asked their soldiers to sacrifice themselves for the good of the society, it is only right for leaders to go through the same motion. They should practice what they have preached.\n\nAs war is seen as a noble act, tu sat serves as redemption in case of defeat. It is also a way to tell the enemy: \u201cYou might have won the battle/war but you don\u2019t deserve to win because you don\u2019t have the chinh nghia (just cause).\u201d And it is not only just cause: it is the moral belief that the cause they are fighting for deserves their total sacrifice.

(Fort Mahone was named \"Fort Damnation\" by the Yankees) *Handpicked men of the 53rd (My great grandfather was one of these) made the final, night assault at Petersburg in an attempt to break Grant's line. This was against Fort Stedman which was a few miles to the slight northeast. They initially succeeded, but reinforcements drove them back. This video is made from photographs which were taken the day after the 53rd evacuated the lines the night before to begin the retreat to Appomattox. I have many more pictures taken by the same photographer, one of these shows a 14 year old boy and the other is the famous picture of the blond, handsome soldier with his musket.\n===========================\n*General Gordon promised the men a gold medal and 30 days leave if they accomplished their task and many years after the War my great grandfather wrote General Gordon, who was then governor of Georgia about this incident.
