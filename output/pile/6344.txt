    "text": "100 fans of 24 meet Chloe O'Brian at box-set launch\n\nActress Mary Lynn Rajskub, who played CTU's finest computer whizz Chloe O'Brian in the hit Fox show 24, was on hand to meet fans of the series during the launch of the 8th season on Blu-ray and DVD.\n\nSpecifically, she was there to highlight a new feature of the box-set, one that shows exactly what happens to Chloe after the season's, and indeed entire series', climatic and emotional finale.\n\nRajskub also took part in a Q&A session with the fans, before being subjected to a \"Jack Attack\", where each audience member donned masks of Kiefer Sutherland. Mind you, just think how many terrorist plots could be foiled with 100 Jack Bauers? Alternatively, with that many, it would only take just over 14 minutes to solve the case. That wouldn't make much of a box-set though.\n\n24 Season 8 is out now in a 4-disc Blu-ray set (with a bonus DVD) for \u00a359.99, and 6-disc DVD set (with bonus DVD) for \u00a349.99. There's also a mega-set featuring all 8 seasons and the TV movie Redemption on DVD for \u00a3244.99 - it's a whopping 48 discs in total.\n\nOur senior ed of news and features has been a tech and games journalist for more than 27 years, and has been with Pocket-lint for over five. Rik has edited a number of videogame magazines in the past, was deputy editor of Home Cinema Choice, and his TV career included stints as co-presenter of Channel 4's Gamesmaster and Sky One\u2019s Games World."
