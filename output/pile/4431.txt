There are some outlier Baptist and charismatics who seemed to have picked up issues, but even the SBC actively participates in ecumenical organizations with Catholics ad fellow Christians.

There are some outlier Baptist and charismatics who seemed to have picked up issues, but even the SBC actively participates in ecumenical organizations with Catholics ad fellow Christians. <<\n\nI agree, I think most major protestant denominations have no problem accepting Catholic and Orthodox Christians are legitimate Christians. The \"Catholics ain't Christian\" stuff seems to a fringe movement limited to some fundamentalist \"born again\" types. They'd also probably say most of their fellow protestants, and indeed, about 90% of practicing Christians in the world, \"ain't Christian\", since they only believe their brand of Christianity to be legit. History certainly isn't in their favor, the apostles themselves would be \"non Christians\" in their eyes.\n\n>> I myself have been both Methodist and Orthodox and moved between the two with nary a look nor did I burst into flames. In fact the Orthodox Church took my Methodist Baptism for membership. <<\n\nTrue, I think the rule of thumb for Catholic and Orthodox Churches is that a protestant baptism is valid as long as it's a tridentine baptism done with a traditional understanding of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. The vast majority of protestant churches fit that definition. Those that are non-tridentine often don't do the sacrament of baptism anyway. And non-Chrisitan churches like Mormons say \"Father, Son, and Holy Spirt\", but believe them to be three separate gods who \"work together\". Thus their baptism deviates from historic Christianity and what was established in the Bible, so it's not a Christian baptism. This isn't to say they're bad people though. Many Mormons behave in a more Christian manner than a lot of \"Christians\" in the world.\n\nSo does that mean my matched set of Genuine Nephite Chessmen in the Curelom skin pouch could be fakes?\n\nThere may be another opus in your future...\n\nWhere can we find an 'OFFICIAL MORMON' teaching website??\n\nOfficial sites are sites supported by LDS officials unless said official sites are considered unofficial by said officials.\n\nAt that point such sites are unofficial unless officially referenced for official purposes by officials who can do so officially.\n\nThis should not be misconstrued as an indication that official sites can be unofficially recognized as official nor should it be implied that unofficial sites cannot contain official information, but are not officially allowed to be offical despite their official contents due the their unofficialness.\n\nOfficial sites will be official and recognized as official by officials of the LDS unless there is an official reason to mark them as unofficial either temporally or permanently, which would make the official content officially unofficial.\n\nThis is also not to imply that recognized sites, often used on FR by haters and bigots cannot contain official information, it just means that content, despite its official status, is no longer official and should be consider unofficial despite the same information being official on an official site elsewhere.\n\nEven then the officialness my be amended due to the use of the unofficial information which may determine the officialness of anything be it official or unofficial depending on how and where it is used officially or unofficially.\n\nI hope this clear things up for the lurkers out there.\n\nThe haters tend to make things complicated and confusing when it is all really quite crystal clear.\n\n--Ejonesie22\n\n59\nposted on 12/30/2012 3:39:53 AM PST\nby Elsie\n(Heck is where people, who don't believe in Gosh, think they are not going...)\n\nJohn 6:28-29\n\nThen they asked him, \u0093What must we do to do the works God requires?\u0094\n\nJesus answered, \u0093The work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent.\u0094\n\n1 John 3:21-24\n\nDear friends, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have confidence before God and receive from him anything we ask, because we keep his commands and do what pleases him. And this is his command:to believe in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and to love one another as he commanded us. The one who keeps God\u0092s commands lives in him, and he in them. And this is how we know that he lives in us: We know it by the Spirit he gave us.\n\n61\nposted on 12/30/2012 3:44:58 AM PST\nby Elsie\n(Heck is where people, who don't believe in Gosh, think they are not going...)\n\n>> As a former mormon who has lived in several mormon-controlled communities, I can assure you that I have personally known of mormon pedophiles, mormon drunks, mormon thieves and mormon wife-beaters. <<\n\nALL religious denominations have that. There are examples of Jewish pedophiles, Jewish drunks, Jewish thieves and Jewish wife-beaters.... Southern Baptist pedophiles, Southern Baptist drunks, Southern Baptist thieves and Southern Baptist wife-beaters.... Catholic pedophiles, Catholic drunks, Catholic thieves and Catholic wife-beaters.... all of us are human and fall short of the glory of the God.\n\nI don't think anyone would claim a particular religious community is made up of infallible members. I simply said MANY Mormons behave him in a more Christian manner than a lot of self-proclaimed \"Christians\" in this country. This doesn't mean they don't have their share of seedy Mormons.\n\n>> Former LDS bishop arraigned, accused of bilking 'little guys' Is this the behavior that you consider the most \"Christian\"? <<\n\nOf course not. By better behavior, I mean that studies have shown that Mormon families on average are much more likely to be intact two parent marriages, have less drug use, crime, adultery, and more weekly church attendance than the \"average\" Catholic or Protestant household in America. Those are the facts whether you like them or not. I am NOT a Mormon but it certainly looks bad among mainstream Christians that so many Christian families do not behave in a Christ-like manner. It's very sad that half of all marriages now end in divorce.\n\n>> Even if it is, mormonism is NOT Christianity...even if \"many\" behave. <<\n\nAs I previously noted twice, I do NOT claim Mormonism is Christianity. They certainly aren't... but overall they simply behave more morally and Christ-like than a lot of self-proclaimed Christians.\n\nIn reality, \"many\" DO NOT claim Mormonism is Christianity. It's baseless propaganda from the mainstream media that only \"evangelicals don't think Mormons are Christian\". In reality, EVERY mainstream Christian denomination REJECTS the idea that Mormons are Christians. Catholics, Orthodox, and \"mainline\" protestant churches have ALL said Mormon doctrines are incompatible with Christianity. Mormonism is a polytheistic religion that denies basic Christian tenants and practices things no genuine Christian denomination would accept, such as baptizing death people. They claim Jesus is the messiah and divine, but so do many other non-Christian religions like the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed faith. Mormons are no more \"Christian\" than Hindus are.\n\nAs I previously noted twice, I do NOT claim Mormonism is Christianity. They certainly aren't... but overall they simply behave more morally and Christ-like than a lot of self-proclaimed Christians.\n\nWhat kind of proof do you have to substantiate the \"over all\" claim? I have personally found that those who claim to be Christians behave more morally than a heckuva lot of mormons that I have known....and some of the most \"morally behaved\" folks I have met were Jehovah's Witnesses.\n\nI guess when there is a sect that spends billions of dollars on TV and radio advertising proclaiming its \"morality\" and has thousands of internet sites doing the same some folks will buy into the outward appearance.\n\nGive us an example of the percentages of \"self-proclaimed Christians\" vs the \"superior moral mormons\" that you personally know, along with a description of the location in which you are finding these examples.
