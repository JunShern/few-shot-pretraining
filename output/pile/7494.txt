How can I regain some health?\nI've gone through my stash of mushrooms and can't leave the current screen.\n\nA:\n\nMethod 1 : during a fight hold up the shield for a while and you'll see a circle closing in on you - when it gets close in you gain an extra star.\n\nA:\n\nYou can restore health between battles by sitting down (such as in Logfella's cabin) or by eating a mushroom.\n\n"
