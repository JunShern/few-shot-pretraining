    "text": "I am an evil giraffe. Who no longer blogs about politics.\n\nCome, I will conceal nothing from you: while I am friendly to a lot of libertarian ideas, I am not hard-shelled about it. I am no Lsyander Spooner or Benjamin Tucker. But I do know enough about the subject to know that, say, I was name-dropping some of the old-time thinkers there that the modern anarcho-capitalists like. In other words: I at least know what a modern Libertarian looks like.\n\nI can only imagine, therefore, that the better-informed voters in Virginia have been somewhat perplexed by Robert Sarvis, for in recent weeks he appears to have been doing his level best to give the impression that his party label is incidental. In a recent Reason interview, Sarvis explained that he was \u201cnot into the whole Austrian type, strongly libertarian economics,\u201d preferring \u201cmore mainstream economics\u201d instead. The candidate expanded on this during an oddly defensive interview with MSNBC\u2019s Chuck Todd, in which he seemed put off not so much by \u201cstrongly libertarian economics\u201d as by libertarian economics per se. As governor, Sarvis told Todd, he would be hesitant to cut taxes, unsure as to how he might \u201creduce spending,\u201d and open to indulging the largest piece of federal social policy since 1965 by expanding Virginia\u2019s Medicaid program. I am generally a critic of the tendency of small-government types to try to purge their ranks of those deemed sufficiently impure, but I must confess that this interview left even me wondering whether Sarvis is in need of a dictionary.\n\nCharles goes on to note that Sarvis favors putting chips in people\u2019s cars so that they can be taxed for their mileage. Let me repeat that: ROBERT SARVIS WANTS TO PUT A CHIP IN YOUR CAR SO THAT YOU CAN BE TAXED FOR YOUR MILEAGE. Let\u2019s switch now to Ben Domenech for that:\n\nThat last position is particularly nonsensical to me: a VMT, which generally requires a government GPS to be installed in your car to track your miles driven, is about the most anti-libertarian transportation tax you can think of \u2013 even those radical libertarians at Brookings think it\u2019s a bad idea, and it was one of the potential bad ideas in McDonnell\u2019s transportation plan that got killed over it: \u201cThe biggest concern may be privacy. Eighty-six percent of area commuters would oppose having a GPS device installed in their car to track their miles, according to a study by the Council of Governments Transportation Planning Board released last week.\u201d Big government technocrats may like such steps, but I cannot think of a single coherent libertarian case for such an invasion of individual privacy.\n\nThe bottom line is that if you live in Virginia, you have a choice: Republican Ken Cuccinelli, who actually does want to reduce the government\u2019s influence over the state economy, or Democrat Terry McAuliffe, who does not. Voting for Robert Sarvis merely helps McAuliffe win, and \u2013 this may be more important \u2013 you won\u2019t even get to feel pro-liberty when you do it. Unless, of course, you think that the feds putting a chip in your car to track your movements mileage is somehow pro-liberty.\n\nI mean, how the heck can even take the Libertarian Party of Virginia seriously if they run candidates who want the feds to put chips in people\u2019s cars?\n\nSimple. The Libertarians started as a bunch of disgruntled Republicans. As is so often these sorts of \u201cdivorces\u201d, the fight against the Republicans has become more important then their fight for freedom. Plenty of time (I believe the thinking goes) to Return the country to a Constitutional Republic once the Republicans have been destroyed\u2026..\n\nJust addressing the GPS-in-the-car thing, the alleged \u201cLibertarian\u201d argument is that it\u2019s pay-per-use. I think it is a stupid idea, but I must point out that if you carry a cell phone with you, \u201cthey\u201d already have this data, and if you have OnStar, they could already *do* this\u2026\n.\nThere\u2019s also an outfit in Cali that make.a device that will read just the odometer and upload it via onboard diagnostics, but \u2026 since it\u2019s cellular, still trackable.\n.\nStill a bad idea.\n.\nMew\n\nAlso Libertarians keep on giving \u201cCuccinelli is the anti-thesis of Liberty\u201d but have yet to back it with anything other then T-Mac talking points.\nConservatives can actually point to some of Ken\u2019s more \u201clibertarian\u201d votes.\nSarvis on the other hand has no voting record to speak of and because he\u2019s the LP nominee he\u2019s been allowed to pose as a Libertarian unchallenged.\nLP should realize that the GOP will start questioning their nominee\u2019s sincerity from now on. Especially when the nominee is so blatantly obvious stalking horse.\nSarvis has done nothing in this campaign but scream at Ken for being a devout Catholic.\n\nNot dumber so much, as the key difference between the two parties. Democrats go for bigger, building the Hive. Republicans do not take orders well, and are annoyed by mobs as a rule, as so are much more likely to form a \u201cThird Party\u201d (Yes, I know we have almost a dozen of them at this point), or escape into the mountains (Where the Democrats track them down at gunpoint, sigh, because Everyone must play their game).\n\nPrediction: I\u2019ll bet we\u2019ll find out after the election that the Democrats have secretly been boosting Sarvis\u2019 campaign. They learned how effective a spoiler candidate can be in 2008, when Al Franken won because an independent candidate siphoned away conservative votes from the Republican candidate. And Todd Akin was actually chosen by Democrat crossover voters as the Republican candidate who would be easiest for Claire McCaskill to beat."
