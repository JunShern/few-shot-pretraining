    "text": "CoolerMaster MasterCase 5 and Pro 5 Review\n\nIntroduction and Technical Specification\n\n| Source: CoolerMaster Price: \u00a389-\u00a3109 Author: Gary Wain\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn a break from the norm this is actually going to be two reviews in one. Why? Well because the brand new MasterCase5 from CoolerMaster is available in vanilla form and as the Pro 5 which offers additional features. Not only that, but if you've purchased the base model and want to upgrade at a later date you can, in theory at least, buy the accessories pack, and using the free form modular system, upgrade it to a Pro 5. We like the idea of a modular case, a case that you can change and alter to suite your needs or whims, let's just hope this modular concept isn't just a concept, and CoolerMaster are able to put some meat on the MasterCase bones. So without further ado, let's have a look at the spec sheet for the case.\n\nTechnical Specification\n\nDimensions 235x512x548mm (WxHxD) Materials Steel chassis and Plastic trim Motherboard Support ATX, M-ATX, M-ITX 5.25\" 2 3.5\" 2 2.5\" 2+2 PCI slots 7 Cooling Front: 3x120/140 (1x140 installed) Top: 2x120/140 Rear: 1x120/140 (1x140 Installed) Water Cooling support Front: 240/280mm up to 40mm thick Top: No Support Rear: 120/140mm Max CPU cooler Height 190mm Max GPU length 412mm (296 with HDD cage)\n\n1 - Introduction and Technical Specification 2 - Up Close: Exterior 3 - Up Close: interior 4 - Rear, Stripped, and in the Nip 5 - In The Nip Continued 6 - The Build 7 - Cooling Options 8 - Pro 5 and Pro 5 Accessory Pack 9 - Pro 5 and Pro 5 Accessories Continued 10 - Conclusion \u00abPrev 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Next\u00bb\n\nMost Recent Comments"
