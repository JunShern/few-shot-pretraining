SMITH, Circuit Judge:*\n\n\n\n       *\n         Pursuant to 5TH CIR . R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not\nbe published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR .\nR. 47.5.4.\n\f   Case: 09-30697       Document: 00511028832           Page: 2     Date Filed: 02/17/2010\n\n                                        No. 09-30697\n\n      Paul Robbins, a Louisiana prisoner, appeals the dismissal of his pro se, in\nforma pauperis 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 civil rights suit as frivolous and for failure to\nstate a claim. We dismiss the appeal as frivolous.\n      As the magistrate judge (\u201cMJ\u201d) references in his report, Robbins\u2019s initial\ncomplaint was a sixty-one-page, typed screed outlining a host of alleged prob-\nlems with the way defendant Corrections Corporation of America (\u201cCCA\u201d) ran\nits facility. That identical complaint was submitted by eight prisoners, purport-\nedly as a class action, and appears to be a general form working its way around\nthe prison yard. Indeed, the latest prisoner-plaintiff need only do as Robbins\ndid: Obscure the typed-in name and write his in its place.\n      The actual claims in the complaint were not at all of a personal nature,\nand Robbins included nothing to suggest that, or how, he personally suffered in-\njury from the defendants\u2019 alleged wrongful actions. The MJ ordered Robbins to\namend his complaint to provide specific factual allegations to support the claim\nthat his constitutional rights were violated,1 or his complaint would be dis-\nmissed.\n      The amended complaint was hardly better. In it, Robbins attempted to re-\ntain each claim in the original complaint just by stating that \u201cthease fact\u2019s do\ninvolve this inmate plantiff \u2018personly\u2019 and directly\u201d [sic]. As the MJ put it, \u201c[r]a-\nther than provide specific facts regarding the eighteen claims, Plaintiff simply\nreiterated the allegations of the original complaint.\u201d Nevertheless, the MJ tried\n\n\n      1\n          The MJ was precise about what information he needed:\n\n               Specifically, Plaintiff should provide: (A) the name(s) of each per-\n               son who allegedly violated Robbins\u2019 constitutional rights; (B) a\n               description of what each defendant did to violate Robbins\u2019 rights\n               (not the rights of other inmates); (C) the place and date(s) that\n               each event/violation occurred; and (D) a description of the alleged\n               injury Robbins sustained as a result of each alleged violation.\n\n(Emphasis omitted.)\n\n                                                2\n\f   Case: 09-30697       Document: 00511028832           Page: 3     Date Filed: 02/17/2010\n\n                                        No. 09-30697\n\nto tease out just what injuries Robbins claimed he suffered, addressing his \u201ccom-\nplaints\u201d relating to personal medical care, access to legal assistance, the pres-\nence of female guards, and his desire for a transfer to a state-run prison facility.\nUltimately, the MJ recommended dismissal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).\n       The district court agreed with the recommendation and dismissed the\ncomplaint both as frivolous and for failing to state a claim. We review dismissals\nunder \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) as frivolous for abuse of discretion. See, e.g., Siglar v.\nHightower, 112 F.3d 191, 193 (5th Cir. 1997). And we review dismissals under\n\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) for failure to state a claim de novo. Because the district court\ndid not state the subsection on which it relied, our review is de novo. Geiger v.\nJowers, 404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir. 2005) (per curiam).\n       We have a \u201cresponsibility to construe pro se filings liberally.\u201d Sossamon\nv. Texas, 560 F.3d 316, 322 n.3 (5th Cir. 2009), petition for cert. filed, 77\nU.S.L.W. 3657 (U.S. May 22, 2009) (08-1438). Nonetheless, \u201clitigants must still\nbrief contentions in order to preserve them.\u201d Longoria v. Dretke, 507 F.3d 898,\n901 (5th Cir. 2007). To that end, the only claim from his amended complaint\nthat Robbins appears still to be arguing in any detail relates to his medical care.2\nAnd, based on the record, we agree with the MJ that Robbins \u201cessentially com-\nplains that he suffers from a slew of illnesses, and that WCC [his facility] is not\nfollowing the treatment prescribed by the doctors at the LSU Medical Center in\nShreveport.\u201d Robbins\u2019s disagreement with WCC\u2019s medical staff over his treat-\nment regimen does not come close to meeting the \u201cextremely high standard\u201d for\ndeliberate indifference claims. Domino v. Tex. Dep\u2019t of Crim. Justice, 239 F.3d\n752, 756 (5th Cir. 2001); see also Varnado v. Lynaugh, 920 F.2d 320, 321 (5th\n\n\n       2\n        Robbins also raises, for the first time on appeal, a claim that the prison lost his prop-\nerty during a medical stay at LSU. \u201c[I]ssues raised for the first time on appeal \u2018are not review-\nable by this court unless they involve purely legal questions and failure to consider them\nwould result in manifest injustice.\u2019\u201d United States. v. Garcia-Pillado, 898 F.2d 36, 39 (5th Cir.\n1990) (quoting Self v. Blackburn, 751 F.2d 789, 793 (5th Cir. 1985)).\n\n                                               3\n\f   Case: 09-30697   Document: 00511028832     Page: 4    Date Filed: 02/17/2010\n\n                                 No. 09-30697\n\nCir. 1991). Thus, \u201ceven given the requisite liberal construction, [the prisoner]\nhas failed to advance any arguments that suggest that the district court erred\nin dismissing his complaint.\u201d    Douglas v. Haynes, No. 09-20466, 2009 WL\n3848670, at *2 (5th Cir. Nov. 18, 2009) (per curiam) (unpublished).\n      We direct Robbins\u2019s attention to the PLRA\u2019s three-strikes provision, 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). The district court\u2019s dismissal and the dismissal of this appeal\nboth count as strikes under \u00a7 1915(g). See Adepegba v. Hammons, 103 F.3d 383,\n388 (5th Cir.1996). If a prisoner accumulates three strikes, he is not allowed to\nbring another civil action in forma pauperis while incarcerated unless he is un-\nder imminent danger of serious physical injury. Robbins is so warned.\n      The appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. See 5 TH C IR. R. 42.2. All out-\nstanding motions are DENIED.\n\n\n\n\n                                       4\n\f"
