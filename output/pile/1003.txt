    "text": "Warning: this post contains spoilers for season 2 of Legend of Korra!\n\n[Likely you\u2019ve already watched it (and watched it again) but if not \u2014 proceed with caution.]\n\nBook 2: Spirits (AKA season 2) of Legend of Korra only wrapped a little over three months ago but who isn\u2019t already anticipating the next installment? \u201cSpirits\u201d wrapped at a point of such potential, it\u2019s hard to believe we have to wait who knows how long for Book 3: Changes. In the season finale of Korra, \u201cLight in the Dark,\u201d viewers learned that Korra had mastered Bending, the portals between the Spiritual World and the Physical World are open and (least importantly) our heroine is now single. Where does this leave us for season 3? This writer can\u2019t wait to see what creators Bryan Konietzko and Michael DiMartino have in store.\n\n1) Dragons.\n\nA trailer for Book 3 aired in the Netherlands last month, and one gracious fan recorded it and shared it on youtube. While the quality is not great, the 14 second clip was enough to get fans hyped about one thing in particular: DRAGONS. How or why these majestic beasts will come into play remains a mystery but their inclusion was a brilliant move from the writers.\n\n\n\n2) Will Asami and Mako Get (Back) Together?\n\nLast season, we saw Mako and Korra make a heartfelt attempt at a healthy relationship. As we might have expected, the results were mildly disastrous: they basically broke up mid-season in a nasty fight and then, in a dramatic turn of events, Korra was confronted by a particularly aggressive Spirit which beat the hell out of Korra. Our heroine goes missing, washes up on mysterious shores with amnesia and must undergo a spiritual journey to rediscover her origins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile Mako, somehow, has no idea Korra has disappeared and rekindles a flirtation/quasi-relationship with Asami. Talk about a rebound, am I right? The kicker here is that when Korra returns to Team Avatar with no memory of the breakup, Mako elects not to enlighten her, pretending instead that things are fine. (Because yeah, that\u2019s the mature way to handle things.) By the end of the season, Korra and Mako had chosen to end their romantic relationship but that leaves Mako\u2019s relationship with Asami up in the air. Creators Dimartino an Konietzko have stated that they\u2019re through with the romantic subplots, and perhaps that\u2019s for the best. Next season would be far better if the writers spent some more time developing Mako\u2019s character, and giving him an independent storyline.\n\n3) Jinorah\u2019s Mysterious Abilities.\n\nAt the end of Book 2, Jinorah was the keystone in Korra\u2019s success against the Ultimate Evil Spirit/Unalaq. Viewers received little insight into why or how Jinorah was able to make such an impact. It\u2019s clear that she\u2019s very connected to the spiritual world in a way that few are, maybe she\u2019ll play a role in the next series, helping people adjust to the host of spirits now inhabiting the physical world.\n\n4) The New Prevalence of Spirits in the Physical World.\n\n\n\nBetween Avatar: The Last Airbender and Legend of Korra, we\u2019ve had minimal interaction in the spirit world, (Origins Parts 1 and 2 as well as Aang\u2019s journey with the Lion Turtle jump immediately to mind). Since Korra opened the portals in the last season, and opted to keep them open, there\u2019s limitless potential for story development. Definitively, all we can say is: next season\u2019s theme is an apt one. \u201cBook 3: Change\u201d promises to be an exciting one.\n\n5)What Happened to Prince Zuko\u2019s Mom?\n\nSeriously. We\u2019ve been waiting for this for years now. The writers even trolled us in the very first episode of Korra.\n\nSo far, only books 3 and 4 are confirmed for the series, after that DiMartino and Konietzo have talked about taking an extended break from the Avatar world. If they fail to finally unveil the fate of Zuko\u2019s mom, Ursa, sometime in the next two books\u2026things will not be pretty for them.\n\nBonus!\n\nIn Book 3, we\u2019re finally going to see the Earth Kingdom. We\u2019re pretty excited about that development too.\n\nFor more information about what to expect next season, check out this youtube video from Emergency Awesome \u2014 this guy really knows what he\u2019s talking about.\n\n*Update 3/11/14*\n\nAs for the fate of Prince Zuko\u2019s mom, Ursa, Larkable was misinformed. It\u2019s come to our attention, belatedly, that Dark Horse Comics published a three part story detailing Zuko, Azula and Team Avatar\u2019s journey to find Ursa \u2014 Zuko\u2019s mother. The Search is a continuation of The Promise, both set in the year following the conclusion of Avatar: The Last Airbender. Another trilogy of graphic novels, The Rift, are the most recent Avatar series. Part 1 was released just last week (3/5/14).\n\nHere\u2019s the part where I editorialize. A bit. The mystery surrounding Ursa during Avatar: The Last Airbender was a fairly big one. Obviously, it didn\u2019t overshadow Aang\u2019s battle with Ozai because that would be ridiculous. It\u2019s clear the writer\u2019s had an idea behind Ursa\u2019s disappearance which was grandiose enough to merit a full series of graphic novels. It\u2019s great that they wanted to give that story it\u2019s own arc, however, supplemental content \u2014 like graphic novels\u2013 is called supplemental for a reason. For storytellers to use one type of media to attract a following, then switch to another device to tie up loose ends? That\u2019s not entirely fair to the original audiences. Clearly, Konietzko and DiMartino weren\u2019t going to give Ursa\u2019s story a full episode in the Korra series \u2014 that was never an expectation. But the short story from Katara would have been nice. From that point on, viewers could be directed to The Search trilogy, if they were interested in the details."
