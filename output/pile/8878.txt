    "text": "A company called Cosmic Lifestyle Corp. has designed cocktail glasses they say will work in zero gravity. The cups look sort of like what glasses we know here on Earth, but they\u2019ve got a system of grooves that the company says will hold the liquids more or less in place until you\u2019re ready to put them in your face. Like any foolish endeavor, the zero gravity cups are doing a Kickstarter funding campaign.\n\nOregon\u2019s Ninkasi Brewing has launched vials of yeast into space, then retrieved them, and come up with an imperial stout. While this brings space beer to new heights, the real accomplishment is that the company refrained from saying that the beer is \u201cout of this world.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019ve had a couple in today\u2019s revelry, you may be the most attractive person in the bar, according to a new study.\n\nResearchers found that if a person has a glass or two of wine, their image is more attractive to other people than if they were sober. Unfortunately, this doesn\u2019t mean double-fisting makes you sexy, it means that subtle changes in your appearance after a drink or two (read: a smile) makes you more attractive. Another downside is that if you\u2019ve had more than a couple drinks, your attractiveness goes down.\n\nNo research has been done on whether it goes back up again after 8 or 9 drinks. So, let\u2019s just assume for now it really does help.\n\nWell guess what? It\u2019s back! Unless you live in a fifth of the states here in the U.S. Then your nose is just boned for regular reasons.\n\nPalcohol has, once again, been approved by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau. Four varieties can now be bought! Except approximately 10 states aren\u2019t down with getting your alcohol buzz via your nose, so they\u2019ve already or are planning to halt sales in their respective residences.\n\nMind you, all of The Guys live in the same state, and at the moment, our state has not banned Palcohol. This just made the SeriouslyGuys Fantasy Football draft that much more snortier.\n\nTwo U.S. Secret Service agents reportedly collided their car into a White House barrier Wednesday night. According to House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-UT), the agents were partying in Georgetown to celebrate a Secret Service spokesman\u2019s retirement (too soon, apparently) until called back to respond to an incident at the White House.\n\nAlcohol is suspected as a factor, which isn\u2019t much of a secret considering that these are the same barriers that the Secret Service set up in the first place. At this point, the only secret that the Secret Service has kept protected is that they graduated from the police academy back when Commandant Lassard was in charge of it.\n\nIn other news:The Guys are definitely becoming U.S. Secret Service agents.\n\nIf you were looking forward to trying out some wine from the Civil War, you can give up now.\n\nA panel of wine tasters sampled one of five bottles recovered from a ship that sank in 1864 bound for the South. It was pretty much just seawater, which shouldn\u2019t be shocking, considering that the liquid was milky and grey.\n\nAt this point we should just stop getting excited about booze recovered from shipwrecks, especially if the bottles are sealed with corks that allow in seawater. Centuries from now, people will enjoy screw-top and bag wines from modern shipwrecks.\n\nHey, remember that beer that was probably the oldest ever found? The one from the shipwreck in the Baltic? Scientists now have a better idea of what it tasted like.\n\nSince you probably don\u2019t have the cash to spend on a brewery\u2019s re-creation of the brew, it\u2019s imagination time. Using chemical analysis and other techniques, researchers found that it was an amber ale, and it had an ABV of about 4.5%, which isn\u2019t really the strength you\u2019d think would be imported from a faraway land. Because the bacteria was still alive inside the bottle, scientists were even able to tell what kind of hops were used, but probably knew better than to list it, so they didn\u2019t come off as beer snobs.\n\nJust grab something barrel-aged for this weekend. It will cost you less, and it will still be a trip back in time.\n\nIf you\u2019re in London this month, you\u2019re probably excited about Annie the Owl, a pop up bar that will be open for only one week. You are also probably a crazy person.\n\nThe draw of the bar is that you get to drink with owls. For those of you who don\u2019t know, owls are huge, scary birds that can see you in the dark, and have long talons that could slice you up in a fraction of a second. A place filled with these flying death machines seems like a good place to drink, doesn\u2019t it?\n\nNow, the bar has cut the service of all alcohol in response to concerns from animal rights groups. So you can\u2019t even enjoy the bar for the reason you\u2019re there: to get drunk.\n\nDrinking is good for you. And if you drink, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll remember that fact long into your old age.\n\nAccording to researchers in China, a chemical in beer helps ward off degenerative diseases. A study found that xanthohumol, a chemical found in hops, might help brain cells from oxidative stress that can lead to dementia. That means that while you may not remember how many beers you had last night, there\u2019s a better chance you\u2019ll remember your grandchildren\u2019s names later in life."
