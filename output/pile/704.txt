There also will be limits on workers in two other categories, defined by NASCAR as \u201corganizational\u201d and \u201croad crew.\u201d\n\nThe organizational category includes competition directors, team managers, technical directors and similar positions. Teams with one- or two-car operations will be allotted three roster spots for organizational personnel. Teams with three or four cars can have four.\n\nThe road crew category includes crew chief, car chief, mechanics, engine tuners, tire specialists and similar jobs. The Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series\u2019 limit is 12.\n\nTruex Jr.:NASCAR title caps dramatic season\n\nKenseth:Leaves legacy of admiration, friendship, success\n\nIn an effort to spotlight the work of pit crew members, each over-the-wall team member will be required to wear a uniform number.\n\nAdditionally, the team\u2019s refueler will no longer be allowed to perform other duties \u2014 such as helping with tires or making chassis adjustments \u2014 during pit stops.\n\n\"The drive toward parity is to have more teams have the ability to win,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said. \u201cWe want everybody to have the same amount of resources at the track. And we want to put focus on other team members, as well.\u201d\n\nIn recent seasons, pit stops generally have been in the 11-12-second range. O\u2019Donnell said the reduction in crew size shouldn\u2019t have a big impact on time spent in the pits.\n\n\"These teams are experts at what they do,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it will present some different challenges in terms of how teams approach it. That\u2019s one of the beauties of this \u2014 we\u2019ll see more innovation. The stops might be a little slower, but I wouldn\u2019t anticipate anything drastic.\u201d"
