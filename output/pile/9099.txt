    "text": "follow lisa is cooking\n\nI have a little problem. I'm addicted to cookbooks, food writing, recipe collecting, and cooking. I have a lot of recipes waiting for me to try them, and ideas from articles, tv, and restaurants often lead to new dishes. I started losing track of what I've done. So now I'm taking photos and writing about what I've prepared\u2014unless it's terrible in which case I forget it ever happened.\n\nsubscribe to\n\nsubscribe via email\n\nThursday, July 16, 2009\n\nWhen I finally opened Mastering the Art of French Cooking, Vol. One and got cooking, I couldn\u2019t stop with just one dish. I wanted a dessert from the book to serve after our meal of coquilles st. jacques. I looked through the desserts and cakes chapter and paused at the flan des isles but decided I\u2019d rather try a cake. The babas and savarins I will definitely come back to in the future, but they weren\u2019t exactly what I wanted for this meal. Then, I arrived at the biscuit au beurre described as a \u201cfine, light spongecake [which] may be served with a sprinkling of powdered sugar, and goes well with tea, or with fruits.\u201d A nice, simple cake with fresh, summer fruit sounded perfect. At the end of the recipe, there are three optional toppings. The first, which I chose, is to simply shake powdered sugar over the cake. The second was an apricot glaze with almonds, and the last was a buttercream icing which could be made chocolate. There are actually suggested variations for serving all of the cakes in the chapter which shows how versatile they are.\n\nThis is a classic sponge cake and contains only egg whites for leavening. You begin the recipe by melting butter and letting it cool. Sugar and egg yolks were then mixed together, and vanilla was added. Egg whites were whisked with salt, sugar was added, and they were whisked to stiff peaks. Then, the folding and sifting began. Some egg whites were added to the yolk mixture and some cake flour was sifted on top. This was folded until partially blended. Then, the same process was repeated with more egg whites and more flour. It was repeated once more, but before completely blending everything together, the melted butter was added. That seemed odd to me. I wanted to add that butter much earlier, but it went in at the end and I\u2019m not sure why. The cake baked in a ten inch pan for about half an hour and then cooled on a rack. It was a little difficult to wrangle it out of the pan, but I managed to do so without destroying it.\n\nAs promised, it was light with a springy airiness about it, and the butter and vanilla gave it nice flavor. The sprinkling of powdered sugar was just enough embellishment. I served the cake with fresh cherries, and that was a happy combination. It\u2019s also mentioned that this cake works well as strawberry shortcake, and I\u2019ll definitely use it that way too. Like so many recipes in this book it\u2019s simple, classic, versatile, and most importantly really good-tasting. Why did I wait so long to start cooking from this book?\n\nIt's so beautiful in its simplicity of flavor and form. I think your choice of topping was perfect - this is the kind of cake that is absolutely delicious and yet will allow its accompaniments, such as fresh fruit, to also shine. With all the excitement surrounding the upcoming Julie & Julia movie, I really need to pick up this book! The title is somewhat intimidating but then, Ms. Child's whole goal was to demystify French cuisine - I have nothing to be afraid of, right? 8-D"
