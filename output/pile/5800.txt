    "text": "American lawmakers have colluded with Wall Street executives to build an economy that no longer works in the best interest of, or even needs, the majority of the American public, according to RT financial host Max Keiser.\n\nRT:There\u2019s a lot of hype and some would say overreaction around all of this but the tell-tale sign is the markets. They haven\u2019t reacted negatively. Is there really a crisis here?\n\n\n\nMax Keiser: I think we should take the words of Warren Buffet to heart. He basically described the Federal Reserve Bank and the American economy as one giant hedge fund. And he is absolutely correct. The way that Wall Street, Washington, and these large funds approach America is as a trade that is backed by $120,000 or $130,000 of debt and that debt gets traded around every day. And the whole initiative here is to buy hedge funds and try to squeak out profits, and they don\u2019t really care who they hurt in the process. Remember America is run by what I call financial jihadists who are basically suicide bankers. Warren Buffett, of course, is one of these suicide bankers and America, from the outside of course, looks like they\u2019re trying to commit financial suicide. But that\u2019s what a financial jihadist does, or a suicide banker. They blow themselves up for their cause and in this case it\u2019s market fundamentalism, a belief in the profit - not the prophet.\n\n\n\nRT:But other tell-tale signs of the economy improving are there, Max. Are we to believe the economic indicators which suggest the US economy is on the up?\n\n\n\nMK: Well, you look at a deal recently between Carl Icahn and Apple computers. It\u2019s the story of two different economies because most Americans deal day-to-day, hand-to-mouth, paycheck-to-paycheck. Then you have the other economy which is the Wall Street economy, the financial jihadist economy. Carl Icahn can tweet about getting Apple to buy back $150 billion of their own stock, which of course is financed with zero percent interest rates and if they make a mistake they get bailed out just like long-term capital management was bailed out. Remember that in the late 1990s, early 2000s, long-term capital management ran into trouble. Alan Greenspan \u2013 the Fed chairman at the time \u2013 bailed them out. He lowered interest rates to bail out a hedge fund. What will happen here \u2013 this is the outcome, there\u2019s two outcomes \u2013 either the Federal Reserve Bank will increase their monthly buyback of bonds from $85 billion a month to $120 or $130 billion a month, or America defaults on its sovereign debt like it did in 1971 when it closed the gold window. Those are the two outcomes. So what we see here is jockeying between these two powerful sources in Washington, Congress, and the Senate. By the way - they all own stocks. Insider trading is legal. They\u2019re all trading this information, they\u2019re on their little phones and they\u2019re trading stocks up and down and making money at the expense of the American people because they are financial terrorists as well. Financial terrorists have captured the American economy. I mean that\u2019s plain and simple. Warren Buffet hit the nail on the head - America is just one giant hedge fund.\n\n\n\nRT:But they will raise the debt ceiling won\u2019t they? Or will they not, because Obama is clearly worried about that? They\u2019re arguing about Obama\u2019s health care. What\u2019s going to happen with that crisis?\n\n\n\nMK: The smart money would be short stock market right now and then when they raise the debt ceiling and print $120 billion to $130 billion a month in brand new quantitative easing there\u2019ll be another huge rally. That\u2019s the insider\u2019s scoop; I\u2019m telling you how to make money on this fa\u00e7ade, this Kabuki theater that has become America. America is the most watched soap opera in the world right now; it\u2019s a huge hedge fund. You\u2019ve got CNBC covering it like it\u2019s an episode from \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d the popular show about methamphetamine on cable TV. Ben Bernake and Barack Obama, you can almost picture them in the back room cooking up some meth and selling it on the street to finance their habit, which is defense spending, torture, extraordinary rendition, bombing people overseas, droning people that costs a lot of money. The only way they can finance that is by treating the entire economy like it\u2019s a hedge fund where they just extract wealth second by second, manipulating markets, trading inside information. JP Morgan, Lloyd Blankfein, HSBC, Barclays, inside trading, market manipulation; they\u2019ve been caught at it time and time again. Laundering money from drug cartels in the face of HSBC over and over again. It\u2019s just drugs, insider trading, market manipulation, and Warren Buffett. That\u2019s all that\u2019s left in America.\n\n\n\nRT:You\u2019re great with the plot lines so how is this particular episode going to end? The episode of the federal government shutdown. Is it going to end soon? Could it drag on for three weeks like we\u2019ve seen in the past?\n\n\n\nMK: A lot of people get hurt but the people in Washington consider the American public to be expendable. They don\u2019t need the American public. They don\u2019t need their taxes, they don\u2019t need them working - because when they need money they just print it. It\u2019s like Saudi Arabia in America. In Saudi Arabia when they need more money they just pump more oil. They don\u2019t need the population, that\u2019s why they live in destitute and why there\u2019s so much poverty in Saudi Arabia. It\u2019s the same thing in America \u2013 there\u2019s a huge amount of poverty because...when they need some cash, they just get Ben Bernake to print it. It\u2019s Saudi Arabia, it\u2019s called the new American dream. The Saudi Arabian dream is alive in America.\n\n\n\nThe statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT."
