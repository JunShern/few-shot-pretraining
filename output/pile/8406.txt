But the\r\nKludts' hopes to adopt the children were first delayed, long beyond the required and customary time\r\nperiods, and then were interrupted when the Department removed the children from the Kludt home. \r\nThat removal was based on Department administrative findings that Debbie Kludt had inflicted a\r\nblunt force trauma on C.G.B. and then neglected the child's medical needs\u00e2\u0080\u0094findings contained in\r\na Department letter dated May 21, 2003, but contradicted by the Kludts, who maintained C.G.B. was\r\ninjured in a bicycle accident.  The Kludts ultimately asked the trial court to name them, rather than\r\nthe Department, managing conservators of the two children.  Mediation proved futile.  Over a year\r\nafter the children had been removed from the Kludts' home, the trial court was finally able to bring\r\nthe Kludts' request to a hearing.  The court denied the Kludts possession of the children, because by\r\ncontract the Department could remove the children from the Kludts' home without cause and because\r\nthe children, by the time of the hearing, had been out of the Kludts home for over a year.  The trial\r\ncourt, however, directed at the Department some strongly-worded negative findings, which are not\r\nrelevant to this appeal; ruled the Department's administrative findings against the Kludts were\r\nunfounded; and entered a number of orders, only two of which are challenged in this appeal.\n\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0The Department appeals,\n asking only that we strike from the trial court's order of April 8,\r\n2004, the parts of the order exonerating the Kludts \"from any wrongdoing toward\" C.G.B. and J.R.B.\r\nand ordering the Department \"to expunge from its records and its computer system the administrative\r\nfindings contained in the letter dated May 21, 2003 and signed by Angela L. Nowell.\"  The\r\nDepartment asserts that, once the trial court found the Kludts lacked standing, the trial court had no\r\nsubject-matter jurisdiction to exonerate the Kludts or to order the Department's records expunged. \r\nWe disagree and conclude the trial court had authority to enter its order because (1) the Kludts had\r\nstanding, and (2) even if the Kludts lacked standing, the trial court had inherent power to enter the\r\norder.\nThe Kludts Had Standing\n\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0Ordinarily, standing must be established before a court will have the subject-matter\r\njurisdiction essential to its power to decide a case.  Bland Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Blue, 34 S.W.3d 547,\r\n553\u00e2\u0080\u009354 (Tex. 2000).  Here, the Kludts had standing under Section 102.003(a)(12) of the Texas\r\nFamily Code, which provides that a suit seeking modification of the parent-child relationship may\r\nbe filed by \"a person who is a foster parent of a child placed by the Department . . . in the person's\r\nhome for at least 12 months ending not more than 90 days preceding the date of the filing of the\r\npetition.\"  Tex.

On June 19, 2003, seventy-eight days after the Department removed the\r\nchildren from their home, the Kludts filed their petition to modify.  Therefore, pursuant to Section\r\n102.003(a)(12), the Kludts had standing.  The trial court erred in concluding they had none.\n \r\nBecause the Kludts had standing, the trial court's order can be sustained on that basis.\nThe Court Had Inherent Power To Enter the Order\n\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0But even if the Kludts had no standing to seek conservatorship of the children, the trial court\r\nclearly has a continuing statutory duty to oversee the children's case, including the Department's\r\nsupervision of them.\n\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0For example, the supervising court must review the conservatorship appointment of the\r\nDepartment or another agency and the substitute care thereunder.  Tex. Fam. Code Ann. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a0263.002\r\n(Vernon 2002).  The Department must create a \"service plan\" for each child in its custody within\r\nforty-five days after the court renders a temporary order appointing it temporary managing\r\nconservator.  Tex.

In the plan, the Department must set\r\nout its goals for the child, specifying how it intends to seek a \"permanent safe placement\" for the\r\nchild, whether by termination and placement for adoption, by return to their family, or by other\r\nmeans.   Tex. Fam. Code Ann. \u00c2\u00a7 263.102 (Vernon 2002).  The plan is explicitly subject to review\r\nby the court of continuing jurisdiction over the child.  Tex. Fam.

The trial court's hearings must be held no less frequently than as\r\nset out by statute.  See Tex. Fam. Code Ann. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7 263.304, 263.305 (Vernon 2002).  The statutory\r\nscheme sets out a number of things that must be done by the trial court, including reviewing the\r\nappropriateness of the current placement; determining the plans, services, and orders needed to\r\nensure that a final order is timely rendered; deciding whether the Department has made reasonable\r\nefforts to finalize the permanency plan; and projecting a likely date for the child to be placed for\r\nadoption.  See Tex. Fam. Code Ann. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a0263.306 (Vernon 2002).  At permanency hearings, the court\r\nis required to review the service plan, permanency report, and other information from the hearing,\r\nincluding the child's safety, the ongoing viability of the current placement, and the compliance and\r\nprogress made, including whether the Department has made reasonable efforts to finalize the\r\npermanency plan.  Tex. Fam. Code Ann. \u00c2\u00a7 263.306(b).  The court should always be guided by \"the\r\nbest interest of the child.\"  See Tex. Fam.

The statute makes no such distinction, and there is no more reason to permit an\r\nagency to act outside the best interest of a child than to allow a parent to do so.  Accordingly, the\r\nactions taken by the trial court fall well within the ambit of its explicit and implicit authority to\r\nreview this type of proceeding, and it is clear from the court's findings that, in doing so, it was\r\nproperly performing its duty to C.G.B. and J.R.B.\n\n\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0We affirm the judgment.\n\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0Josh R.

Sims also sued Donald Ray Holt in this case.  Holt was served, but did not appear at trial and\r\nhas not appealed the trial court's judgment. \r\n2. The trial court conducted a final hearing in this case December 7, 2006.  Sims appeared with\r\nher counsel; Jenkins appeared pro se. \r\n3. Jenkins also paid Sims $600.00 to have the mobile home moved onto the disputed property. \r\nPart of Jenkins' mortgage payment was meant to reimburse Sims for that additional cost. \r\n4. At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court also made several oral pronouncements that\r\nwere consistent with its later-entered written findings of fact and conclusions of law.  The trial court\r\nstated that all the money Jenkins had paid to Sims should be considered as rental payments, which\r\nmeant Jenkins was not entitled to a refund of any money. \r\n5. Jenkins' appellate brief raises two issues that are, at best, far from a model of clarity.  For\r\nexample, the first issue raised appears to challenge the legal sufficiency of the evidence to support\r\nthe trial court's judgment.  Yet, the brief does not attempt to set forth the proper standard of review\r\nfor such an issue.  And in providing analysis on the issue raised, Jenkins appears to provide a factual\r\nsufficiency analysis.  Then, to further complicate matters, she asks for this case to be remanded to\r\nthe trial court for a determination of whether the mobile home is real or personal property.  Thus,\r\nit would appear she has raised three separate and distinct issues within a single point of error, even\r\nthough none of these issues have been clearly briefed or analyzed.  A similar deficiency appears in\r\nthe briefing portion for Jenkins' second point of error.  \n\tA party's brief \"must contain a clear and concise argument for the contentions made, with\r\nappropriate citations to authorities and to the record.\"  Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(h).  Given these\r\ndeficiencies, we could conclude Jenkins has inadequately briefed these issues.  See, e.g., El Paso\r\nNatural Gas Co. v. Strayhorn, 208 S.W.3d 676, 681 n.7 (Tex. App.--Texarkana 2006, no pet.). \r\nHowever, in this case, insofar as we can fairly do so, we will address what we have discerned to be\r\nthe main two issues raised in Jenkins' brief.  To the extent that any additional issues have been\r\nraised, we overrule those issues as both multifarious, see In re Guardianship of Moon, 216 S.W.3d\r\n506, 508 (Tex. App.--Texarkana 2007, no pet.), and inadequately briefed, see Strayhorn, 208\r\nS.W.3d at 681 n.7.\n\tOur leniency in substantively addressing any issues in this case should not be interpreted as\r\nfuture permission to submit briefs that raise multifarious points of error, because our law grants us\r\ndiscretion to summarily overrule the entirety of any multifarious or inadequately briefed points of\r\nerror.  See, e.g., Foster v. State, 101 S.W.3d 490, 499 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 2002, no pet.)\r\n(three separate issues combined into single point of error ruled inadequately briefed and\r\nmultifarious); H.B. Zachry Co. v. Ceco Steel Prods. Corp., 404 S.W.2d 113, 133 (Tex. Civ.\r\nApp.--Eastland 1966, writ ref'd n.r.e.) (overruling four separate issues as duplicitous and\r\nmultifarious).\r\n6. Neither party raised at trial or on appeal whether a writing was required even if the mobile\r\nhome was classified as personal property.  See Tex. Bus. & Com. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00c2\u00a02.201 (Vernon 1994)\r\n(writing is required for a sale of goods for the price of $500.00 or more).  \r\n7. Additionally, we note the record is not clear whether the trial court characterized the mobile\r\nhome as \"personal\" or as \"real\" property.  But in finding Sims was the owner, the court labeled the\r\nproperties at issues as both \"real and personal property\" under a single grouping, a characterization\r\nwhich appears in the trial court's findings. \r\n8. We note that the possible application of Section 5.072(a) of the Texas Property Code (which\r\nprohibits oral contracts for sale of land) to the doctrine of promissory estoppel was not at issue in\r\nthis case.  See Tex. Prop. Code Ann. \u00c2\u00a7 5.072(a) (Vernon 2004).\n"
