I want to have an interactive map showing UK counties. I have the map, I have \"mapspinner\" (also dreamweaver) to do the polymap... \nbut, I was wondering if there was a way to use a magic wand to get the area's coordinates?\nI have tried using photoshop export to illustrator paths, but the file doesn't contain any coords (as expected really!). \nDoes anyone know a way to do this? (I see that fireworks might do it, but I don't have that software)\nthanks in advance.\n\nA:\n\nGIMP can do this. See http://docs.gimp.org/en/plug-in-imagemap.html for a tutorial of exactly the task you are trying to accomplish.\n\n"
