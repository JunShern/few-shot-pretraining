    "text": "50 Shades Of Grey: What It Can Teach You About Women\n\nWomen you\u2019ve just met adore thinly veiled chat about your sexual sins.\nDo as Christian Grey, the sexually dominant hero of Fifty Shades of Grey does when he first meets na\u00efve virgin Anastasia Steele, played in director Sam Taylor-Johnson\u2019s big-screen adaptation by Dakota Johnson. She\u2019s just meekly crept into his office to interview the billionaire CEO for her student mag, and he\u2019s using the opportunity to lay it on thick with barely concealed sex chat at every turn. \u201cOh, I exercise control in all things, Miss Steele,\u201d he replies to a question about his charitable work in Darfur. After that, it\u2019s a pretty seamless journey to S&M town.\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nIt helps if you are good looking.\nIf you want to introduce your date to the joys of bondage, it\u2019s good if you\u2019re handsome as hell. In Fifty Shades, Ana agrees to become the sexual submissive of a man who \u201clooks like a male model in a pose for a glossy, high-end magazine\u201d. In the film, Grey is played by a former male model, Jamie Dornan, who posed in glossy, high-end magazines (including this one). Which might explain why she takes so well to being bossed about so much.\n\nMost Popular\n\nNot a male model? Hope lies in an unspecified expensive body wash.\nEven if your date might be hesitant about spanking, win her over with a stimulating shower gel. Every time Ana\u2019s about to call time on caning-as-foreplay, she gets a whiff of Christian Grey\u2019s \u201cexpensive body wash\u201d and is on all fours. In the book, she\u2019s not exactly strong on detail so you\u2019ll have to work out what it might be for yourself. (it's likely not Dove for Men Extra Fresh.)\n\nChicks crave spontaneity. So stalk her.\nSurprise your girl with a visit to her workplace, even if she hasn\u2019t disclosed where that is. Better still if her part-time job is at a hardware store into which you can waltz to order up a selection of cable ties, masking tape and five yards of filament rope. \u201cAre you redecorating?\u201d she\u2019ll ask, wholly unaware that two weeks later she\u2019ll be strung up with cable wires having the time of her life in your Red Room of Pain. Atta girl.\n\nNon-disclosure agreements are the new foreplay.\nShe\u2019ll understand the need for lawyers went she gets a load of the playroom, a citrus smelling, softly lit spot with a large X on the far wall and an 8ft-square iron grid on the ceiling from which hangs a selection of ropes, chains and shackles. Best if she can keep all these paddles, whips, riding crops and canes your special little secret and sign here\u2026\n\n\u2026And contracts are sexy as hell.\nPaperwork has been the missing spark from your far-from sizzling sex life. Do as impossibly good-looking Christian Grey does and draft the dos and don\u2019ts of your dominant\u2013submissive sex games and she\u2019ll be all heart-eyed emojis. Or at the very least tied to a wall.\n\nLadies go wild for email.\nEmail is the prime form of sex correspondence between Grey and Steele and the forum for flirting, foreplay and spelling out exactly what you want to do in the bedroom. Send her the full dictionary definition of submissive so she can bat back by compromise. It\u2019s like Snapchat never happened.\n\nDate five: take her to the STI clinic.\nThere\u2019s no two ways of spinning this so just tell her: you\u2019ve had such a wonderful night of passion together you\u2019d like to take the relationship to the next level and get her checked out for the clap. Also [tiny voice], you\u2019d quite like to watch.\n\nSize does matter - especially in ceiling-to-window ratios.\nAna digs \u201cconsiderable length\u201d in both the trouser and window department. Even if you\u2019re short on the former, distract her with floor-to-ceiling windows in every room you romance her. Other tips: blindfold her; pop on the cuffs; rule out touching.\n\nGirls are turned on by mummy issues\nTo get her into bed, go all Freudian. Happily for Christian Grey, he\u2019s all over that. His adoptive mother doesn\u2019t do physical contact. His birth mother was a \u201ccrack whore\u201d. And some nice lady seduced him at 15 and turned him into her adolescent sex slave. Emotional baggage is the new GSOH.
