However, when a comparison between the Japanese and English trailers revealed some costumes weren\u2019t shown, some were concerned the game\u2019s western release could be censored. Now, publisher NIS America has commented on the issue.\n\n\u201cThe content released globally will contain the same costumes and content. Nothing will be removed or replaced in the Western release,\u201d the publisher said on Twitter. \u201cAs for controls, it is more accessible for all players, and not just the hardcore fighting gamers :) You will use your entire controller.\u201d\n\nDespite some of the costumes (featured above) not being shown in the English trailer, it\u2019s worth pointing out that you can customize the ladies to wear lots of different outfits. Read more on the game in our original report here.\n\nSNK Heroines: Tag Team Frenzy will launch for PlayStation 4 and the Nintendo Switch sometime this summer, worldwide."
