Find out what they did inside....\n\nOver the weekend, Duane and Tisha Campbell Martin were all hugged up at a benefit for the New Village Leadership Academy in Calabassas, but recently Tisha was spotted out with a mystery man and two adorable kids at Fatburger.\n\nThe mystery man looks slightly similar to Duane so he may be a family member and the kids are his. But I'm sure Tisha took some food home to her own kids, Zeke and Xen.\n\nTisha's husband has been embroiled in rumors that his relationship with Will Smith is the cause of Will & Jada's marriage being on the rocks...allegedly.\n\nI'm DEFINITLY UTTERLY DISGUSTED with some of the FOUL comments that you BOTTOM OF THE BARREL WORTHLESS TAKING UP SPACE BASTARDS have said about this woman's appearance and her marriage!

There are many days I come home stressed from a long day of work; and I'm able to relax and laugh while watching Martin. You are in my prayers...You Go Girl!\n\nOh please....the rumors about Duane & Will have been out there for years. Waaay before Will's latest marital drama or even before Lisa Rae spoke on it. Just like the rumors been out there for years bout John Travota & Eddie Murphy. Usually where there is smoke there is fire. Whitney was a crack head for 20yrs & blk folks refuse to accept it.\n\nMost of these things are rumors, they are true. By now, we all know that:\nWill is gay\nDuane is also gay\nJohn Travolta is a flaming fairy\nEddie is bisexual.\nAllegedly (have to remember that word for the lawyers).\n\nHe wants a man and he got one at home. she looks a hot azz mess. she was never cute but why is her body built so boxy. i can see his attraction to Will. I can image that big dick or Will's going up and all out inside him. Ummm\n\n...and I don't. It's not a curse, though. It's just the way she's shaped. It just amazes me how people like to pick on the things people can't change. We can change our clothes, our hair, get our nails done, etc. Folks come on here and diss Beyonce's knees. How dumb is that. Last time I checked, her knees were making her money. Tisha is built the way she's built. No need to question or dog her for that.\n\nUmmm ok imma lil curious why would Duane and Will's bromance mess up Will and Jada's marriage...smh! And I quote \"Tisha's husband has been embroiled in rumors that his relationship with Will Smith is the cause of Will & Jada's marriage being on the rocks...allegedly\n\nWanna look like you favorite celebs at more than half off the costs??
