The Wikipedia article for the West Country dialects provides a good introduction, but I am looking for sources that go into greater depth regarding the grammatical differences between Somerset and standard English.\n\nA:\n\nThe first two books on this Amazon UK page are popular guides to the Somerset dialect. The third is an academic account of English dialects by Peter Trudgill, a prominent linguist who has written on regional dialects and on socioliguistics. The index has an entry for Somerset, and there may be some pointers to more specific works in the Further Reading section.\n\n"
