    "text": "Lordi\n\nWith their operatic heavy metal and monster-movie stage persona, Lordi seemed a most unlikely choice to represent their native Finland in the 2006 Eurovision Song Contest. So just imagine how many jaws hit the floor when the group not only claimed top honors, but also earned the most points in the venerable event's history. Vocalist Tomi Petteri Putaansuu, aka Mr. Lordi, assembled Lordi in 1996 in Stockholm, Sweden, following a concert headlined by his favorite band, Kiss. After recruiting guitarist Jussi Syd\u00e4nmaa (known as Amen), bassist Magnum (real name unknown), former Children of Bodom keyboardist Erna Siikavirta (Enary), and drummer Sampsa Astala (Kita), he began writing songs as well as creating the elaborate foam-latex monster costumes and pyrotechnic effects that would become the hallmark of their theatrical live performances.\n\nAfter a series of label auditions went nowhere, Lordi signed to Sony BMG's Finland branch and issued a debut LP, 2002's Get Heavy, which rose to the number three spot on the Finnish charts on the strength of the number one single \"Would You Love a Monsterman?\" Magnum left the group soon after, and with new bassist Pekka Tarvenen (Kalma), Lordi cut a sophomore album, 2004's The Monsterican Dream, which returned them to the Top 20 with \"Blood Red Sandman.\" After touring in support of the LP, both Tarvenen and Siikavirta left the lineup, and with new bassist Samer el Nahhal (Ox) and keyboardist Leena Peisa (Awa) on board, Lordi released a third full-length, The Arockalypse. When the record's chart-topping lead single, \"Hard Rock Hallelujah,\" was appointed Finland's official entry in the 2006 Eurovision Song Contest, some religious leaders criticized the move, charging the band with advocating Satanism (even in the face of their 2003 hit \"The Devil Is a Loser\").\n\nControversy notwithstanding, Lordi scored the most points in contest history with a total of 292, over 40 votes more than runner-up Dima Bilan of Russia. In the wake of Lordi's victory -- Finland's first in Eurovision competition -- tabloids from across Europe scrambled to publish photos of the band sans makeup, which earned criticism from fans and media rivals alike and forced public apologies from the offending parties. On May 26, 2006, Lordi celebrated their triumph with a free open-air performance in Helsinki's Market Square, playing to more than 80,000 fans. Finland president Tarja Halonen even took the stage to award the band for its global recognition. In 2007 the band performed at several American festivals, including Bamboozle and Ozzfest, before touring the States alongside Type O Negative. Lordi then returned to the studio in May 2008 to begin work on Deadache, the band's fourth studio effort. Released later that year, the album featured a stronger emphasis on keyboard parts and horror themes, as well as songwriting contributions from every member of the group. In 2010, the band released their first single, \u201cThis Is Heavy Metal\u201d, from their fifth studio album Babez For Breakfast. It was during this year that drummer Kita left the band. His replacement was Otus but he sadly died, according to an announcement that the band had made on their Facebook page. In September 2012, they released a compilation CD/DVD entitled Scarachives Vol.1 and in 2012 they began recording their sixth album To Beast Or Not To Beast. ~ Jason Ankeny\n\nHitler, Justin Beiber, and Mr. Lordi stand in front of satan's throne. He asks each one what they did to get there. Hitler says i caused the death of millions of Jews and caused a world war. satan says verey good sit at my right. Beiber says I ruined a Generation of music with my faggy little voice satan says your an a**hole sit to my left. He then asks Mr. Lordi and you why are you here Mr. Lordi yells B**ch get off my throne!\n\nI'd agree that Lordi > GWAR. Their music is better for one thing. For another GWAR lost all it's appeal for me at the age where I stopped finding f*rt and vomit jokes hilarious.\nI think Lordi's aesthetic and attitude is more like a hybrid of KISS and Alice Cooper. Only the costumes remind me of GWAR.\n\nI prefer Lordi to GWAR, for multiple reasons: 1) Their costuming is better, IMO...2) Their music, while different from GWAR's, is more sonically enjoyable for me since the vocals are delivered more cleanly...but then again, I'm a power/prog guy, so what do you expect...3) Their catalog is a lot more accessible to new fans who may be put off by GWAR's...\n\nI don't see how people can compare Lordi and GWAR, they are two different styles of music. GWAR is basically thrash metal, whereas Lordi is more heavy metal/hard rock. VERY different styles of music, it's like comparing death metal to power metal.\n\n7 years ago\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nmattman90002001\n\nOnyxhawk is right in some aspects.Lordi and GWAR are two completely different bands.I honestly think that GWAR is kind of insane.They take the whole monster thing to far sometimes.Just because someone wheres a monster costume,doesn't mean there trying to copy someone else.Thats like saying anyone who wears makeup on stage is trying to copy KISS,or like when people claim that Hollywood Undead is trying to copy Slipknot cause they wear masks.Its just stupid.\n\n7 years ago\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nonyxrune\n\n4 stars - Yes, Lordi fits a niche demographic. Their music is an amalgam of horror and hard rock... think soundtrack of some 80's creature/slasher flick. Some have compared them to GWAR, though Oderus from GWAR (himself) disputes this comparison, and jokingly refers to Lordi as \"silly humans in costumes\". Lordi claims it's closer to KISS in terms of genre. Regardless, Lordi is a rock-solid act, adept in their songcraft, with surprisingly catchy tunes frought with tongue-in-cheek horror lyrics.\n\nLordi? Pleeeease. Im sorry but this band needs to go away, or atleast revamp their image/style. Anyone who thinks these guys are good, you need to listen to GWAR, wich is the band that Lordi is trying to copy, and all they manage to do is wear costumes and write wierd music but their show isnt even interesting to watch. i mean they are talented musicians, dont get me wrong. they just need to re-think their approach and not use somebody else's idea for a cheap gimmick.\n\nlordi is the greatest band ever they rock hard!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nI LOVE these guys! they frigin bleed metal with evereything they do. Even better than KISS no contest. Saw them at Ozzfest O7 and they ROCKED! Got the Arockalypse about two weeks later and have been listening to it ever since, Wish they would do a concert in the states again though can't go all the way to Finland to see them!\n\n8 years ago\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nam59236\n\nThese guys put on a brutal show, and no I am not talking about them on Conan, they are more of a show than just a band, using pyrotechnics on the same level as Rammstein, holding buckets of body parts and getting the audience pumped, one of my favorite bands, see them live if you like them if not just enjoy the AROCKALYPSE\n\n8 years ago\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nrunebladecw\n\nSaw these guys open for Type O Negative. Aside from the venue being s**t, they were great. No one in the audience knew who they were, but they had everyone worked up enough to lead a \"Hail Rock!\" chant by about the second song. Great stage presence.\n\nThe Leader of Lordi already stated he didnt know who lordi was before he made his band and also he made all their own costumes. Gwar is just crap their guitar is not bad but the death metal yelling just ruins it all. Lordi is an awsome band and put out awsome music."
