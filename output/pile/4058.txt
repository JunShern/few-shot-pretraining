Catch up on the latest in the energy industry at: \nhttp://www.consultrci.com/web/infostore.nsf/Products/IssuesWatch \n************************************************************************\n\n===============================================================\nSCIENTECH IssueAlert, October 10, 2000\nPG&E's Rate Cap Proposal: Leading the Charge for Re-Regulation, or Protecting \nItself from Economic Disaster? \nBy: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis\n===============================================================\n\nPacific Gas & Electric Co. (PG&E), in filings with the California Public \nUtilities Commission (CPUC) and California Independent System Operator \n(Cal-ISO), has requested that a rate cap be placed on wholesale purchases \nin the state. The utility is asking the CPUC to lower the current rate \ncap from $250 per megawatt hour to $100, or 10 cents per kilowatt hour. \nIn seeking the rate cap, PG&E is joined by Edison International, the parent \ncompany of Southern California Edison, and The Utility Action Network (TURN), \na ratepayer advocacy group.\n\nANALYSIS: The current rate cap of $250 per megawatt hour in the wholesale \nmarket of California resulted from the price spikes experienced in San \nDiego this summer. As San Diego Gas & Electric had paid off its stranded \ncosts, the retail rate freeze in its area was lifted and SDG&E customers \nwere exposed to market-based prices, which doubled and at times tripled \ndue to increased demand in the state and power supply concerns. PG&E \ncustomers \nwere not exposed to the price spikes because, at the time, PG&E had not \npaid off its own stranded costs and was still under a retail rate freeze.\n\nYet the company has felt the impact from the price spikes just the same. \nPG&E buys a great deal of its power on the wholesale market, and as a result \nis about $2.2 billion in debt (some figures suggest it is as high as $2.7 \nbillion). Due to the retail rate freeze still in effect, PG&E has been \nunable to pass this debt on to customers by raising its rates. In real \nterms, PG&E was paying up to 19 cents per kilowatt hour on the wholesale \nmarket this summer, when by law it was only allowed to charge its customers \non average 5 cents per kilowatt hour. In total, PG&E has paid about $2.7 \nbillion more to suppliers than it can bill customers for, and this amount \nis growing by hundreds of millions each month. This explains the utility's \nmotivation in wanting to see the CPUC further lower the cap on wholesale \nrates in California.\n\nHowever, even though PG&E as a whole is in debt, the utility\u0001*as well as \nother divisions under parent company PG&E Corp.\u0001*is still making money off \nderegulation in California. For instance, PG&E's Diablo Canyon nuclear \nplant has been able to capitalize on the high value of power on the wholesale \nmarket. The utility confirmed recently that altogether its power facilities\u0001*\nthe \nones left after the utility was forced to divest the bulk of its power \nassets\u0001*still provide about $150 million a month to the utility. In addition, \nPG&E Corp.'s unregulated energy commodity trading operation has been doing \nvery well. And the unregulated National Energy Group\u0001*which operates in \nmarkets outside of California, such as Massachusetts, Rhode Island and \nNew Hampshire\u0001*posted a 233-percent profit increase for the second quarter. \nThus, it is important to note the distinction between PG&E and its parent, \nPG&E Corp. Ironically, as a whole, PG&E Corp. has stated that it does not \nsupport rate caps, and has opposed the issue when it has surfaced in other \nstates.\n\nPG&E reported second-quarter earnings of $216 million on $2.3 billion in \nrevenue, representing a 26-percent increase over the same quarter last \nyear. Third quarter earnings also reportedly will be strong. This puts \nPG&E in an awkward predicament. On one hand, PG&E wants to convince \nshareholders \nthat the company is doing well and making money from the commodities that \nit sells. On the other hand, PG&E is attempting to convince regulators \nthat it is losing money due to the high wholesale prices that it must pay \nfor power. In fairness, though, the revenue PG&E has earned cannot come \nanywhere near to paying off the massive debt the company has accrued due \nto its obligation of serving customers.\n\nPG&E's rate freeze is scheduled to end March 31, 2002, at the very latest, \nor sooner if it is determined that PG&E's stranded costs have been repaid, \nsomething that utility executives say may already have taken place. Due \nto higher-than-expected revenues and higher-than-market valuations of the \nutility's assets, it may very well be the case that PG&E's stranded costs \nare already paid off. When this is officially determined by the CPUC, PG&E \nwill argue that customers should be liable for some or all of the debt \nit has assumed while the rate caps were in place. The CPUC has scheduled \na hearing to address these issues on Oct. 19. The core question of these \nproceedings will be whether or not PG&E should be allowed to turn over \nits debt to customers through rate increases once the rate freeze is lifted. \nPG&E wants to be able to retroactively bill customers for its debt, based \non the date which the CPUC determines that PG&E had in fact paid off its \nstranded costs, a point groups such as TURN will surely protest.\n\nIt may seem surprising that TURN was among the group with PG&E that filed \nthe petition to lower the rate cap on wholesale prices. Typically, TURN \nand PG&E (along with most utilities) are at polar opposites regarding most \nissues. However, both agree that wholesale rates are too high and want \nto see a new cap put into place, but for completely different reasons. \nTURN says that PG&E and other utilities took a risk when agreeing to the \nrate freeze and they should not be allowed to pass debts that resulted \nfrom that risk onto customers. TURN continues to retain a watch over the \nproceedings related to PG&E's proposal, specifically with regard to the \npossibility that the CPUC will allow the utility to raise rates on customers.\n\nWithin the course of these new developments, it's important to be clear \non PG&E's motivations. Some California lawmakers and consumer advocates \nhave called for a complete return to regulation, arguing that deregulation \nin California has become a failed experiment. Many have surmised that PG&E's \nproposal for wholesale caps is essentially a call to return California \nto a regulated structure. I think this is a misinterpretation. PG&E has \nvery clearly stated that its proposal is a \"necessary short-term step to \ntry to bring prices back in line.\" PG&E's efforts really shouldn't be viewed \nas a move to return California to a regulated market. Rather, PG&E is merely \nattempting to protect its own interests. The utility wants to secure \ntemporary \nlower rates for the power it needs to buy on the wholesale market and \ntransfer \nits debts to customers once the rate freeze is lifted. A return to regulation \nvia a permanent rate cap would not be in PG&E's best interests as it \ncontinues \nto sell power from its nuclear plant. In addition, PG&E probably recognizes \nthat regulation would discourage additional companies from building new \npower plants in California, which would not be good for the long-term economy \nof the state. This also would do little to lower wholesale prices in \nCalifornia. \nAs we discovered this summer, the less supply, the higher the price for \npower. \n\nPG&E's proposal to lower rate caps on wholesale prices is, more than anything \nelse, an attempt to protect itself from what it perceives as disastrous \neconomic impact if it is not able to transfer its debt to customers. A \nrecent Wall Street Journal report inferred that if wholesale prices continue \nto exceed what PG&E can charge customers, the utility could become \n\"technically \ninsolvent\" sometime next year. It will be interesting to see if the CPUC \nhas the same perception when it evaluates PG&E's proposal later this month. \n\n==============================================================\nNeed to design and implement your IT infrastructure?
