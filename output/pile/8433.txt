    "text": "A Sad Day for U.S. Americans\n\nThe following article from Reuters saddened me. Here we have three busloads of women and children (some alone) trying desperately to escape lives of grinding poverty and God knows what else, who are turned away from some temporary processing station by Americans waving our flag and yelling to them that they are unwanted.\n\nIf you want to know some reasons why life is so hard in places like Honduras and Guatemala, check out the book, \u201cRogue State\u201d by William Blum. He will tell you that the United States has intervened in these countries in ways that were violent and ways that kept them poor. As of 2013, Honduras had the highest murder rate in the world, rampant corruption, a bankrupt government that cannot pay salaries to teachers or doctors, and a collapsing infrastructure, according to Don Godo on his blog \u201cHonduras Living\u201d.\n\nIf there is any question about the U.S.\u2019s involvement in the poverty and misery in Guatemala, just look up what happened there with regards to the democratically elected president Jacob Arbenz and the U.S. American company, United Fruit. Because of the U.S.\u2019s help in the suppression of a budding social-democracy in Guatemala, no fewer than 200,000 of her citizens were tortured and/or killed. If Guatemala\u2019s government, or anyone else in Guatemala attempts to initiate systemic changes to aid the poor, they are dealt with by U.S. trained and armed military. Again, you can find this and other such information in William Blum\u2019s book, \u201cRogue State\u201d.\n\nHere is the article about how some of us don\u2019t want Guatemalans and Hondurans trying to escape into our sanctuary.\n\n(Reuters) \u2013 Protesters shouting anti-immigration slogans blocked the arrival of three buses carrying undocumented Central American families to a U.S. Border Patrol station on Tuesday after they were flown to San Diego from Texas.\n\nThe migrants, a group of around 140 adults and children, were sent to California to be assigned case numbers and undergo background checks before most were likely to be released under limited supervision to await deportation proceedings, U.S. immigration officials said.\n\nBut plans to bring the immigrants to a Border Patrol outpost in Murrieta, 60 miles (100 km) north of San Diego, sparked an outcry from town mayor Alan Long, who said the migrants posed a public safety threat to his community.\n\nThe group is part of a growing wave of families and unaccompanied minors fleeing Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras and streaming by the thousands into the United States by way of human trafficking networks through Mexico.\n\nMost have shown up in Texas, overwhelming detention and processing facilities there.\n\nThe surge has left U.S. immigration officials scrambling to handle mass numbers of Central American migrants who, by law, the government cannot immediately deport, as they normally could illegal border crossers of Mexican or Canadian origin.\n\nMore than 52,000 unaccompanied children from Central America have been caught trying to sneak over the U.S.-Mexico border since October, double the number from the same period the year before, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection figures. Thousands more were apprehended with their parents.\n\nThe group caught up in Tuesday\u2019s confrontation arrived by plane at midday in San Diego from Texas, where they had been apprehended while trying to cross the border, and were put on three unmarked buses for the ride to Murrieta.\n\nAs the buses neared their destination, some 150 protesters waiving American flags and shouting \u201cGo home \u2013 we don\u2019t want you here,\u201d filled a street leading to the access road for the Border Patrol station, blocking the buses from reaching the facility.\n\nThe demonstrators disregarded orders from police to disperse, but officers did not attempt to intervene physically to break up the demonstration.\n\nAfter about 25 minutes, the buses backed up, turned around and left. A board member of the union representing border patrol agents, Chris Harris, said the buses would likely be rerouted to one of six other Border Patrol stations in the San Diego sector.\n\nLois Haley, a spokesman for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, declined to say where the buses were headed.\n\nLocal television station San Diego 6 said the buses went to the Chula Vista Station where about 140 migrants, mainly women and children, could be seen entering, though it was unclear if they were processed inside. It also said several of the children were taken to hospital for unspecified treatment.\n\nA supervisor at Chula Vista declined to comment.\n\nA separate group of undocumented families with children was being sent on Tuesday to a similar processing facility in El Centro, California, a desert community about 100 miles east of San Diego, U.S. immigration officials said. But there was no word on any disruptions of their arrival.\n\nRate this:\n\nLike this:\n\nRelated\n\nPost navigation\n\nOne thought on \u201cA Sad Day for U.S. Americans\u201d\n\nWe call ourselves good citizens, lovers of freedom, filled with the American spirit of hospitality\u2026..Shame on us for pushing away those who need help.
