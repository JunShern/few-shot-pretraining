For that I am following this tutorial. I created the required feature and was able to deploy and test it with simple JavaScript alert. Now I am trying to call an ASPX page on click of ribbon button.\nFor that I created an Application Page in my project. But in the code behind file of ASP.NET page I get the following error:\nThe type or namespace name 'LayoutsPageBase' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)\nC:\\Users\\Administrator\\Documents\\Visual Studio 2012\\Projects\\CustomRibbonButton\\CustomRibbonButton\\Layouts\\CustomRibbonButton\\ApplicationPage1.aspx.cs\n\nI have imported (I hope thats what you call it in C#) Microsoft.SharePoint.WebControls with statement using Microsoft.SharePoint.WebControls;\nFrom this question on StackOverflow I was able to figure that LayoutsPageBase class is not available in sandbox solutions (with path as \\UserCode\\assemblies).\nSo in my project I went to References > Microsoft.SharePoint, right-clicked on it to view its Properties. Its Path in Properties window is shown as C:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\Microsoft Shared\\Web Server Extensions\\15\\ISAPI\\Microsoft.SharePoint.dll.\nWhat can be the reason for this error and how can it be solved?\n\nA:\n\nYou can check whether or not a SharePoint project is Sandboxed by right clicking the project in Solution Explorer and viewing the properies.\nThere is a true/false property called Sandboxed Solution.\n\n"
