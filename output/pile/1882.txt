    "text": "Last week, when we debuted our Philly Corruption All-Star playing cards\u2014collect \u2018em all and trade them with your friends!\u2014I wrote about the culture of corruption we\u2019ve long tolerated here, a culture notable for its lack of shame and for good people who regularly look the other way in the face of systemic abuse. Of course, we focused on obvious cases of corruption, like the indicted and convicted pols whose perp walks account for so many of our headlines these days.\n\nBut there\u2019s another type of corruption that also sets us apart, and it\u2019s the kind that\u2019s completely legal. In some ways, it\u2019s more corrosive than good old-fashioned politicians on the take. It\u2019s traditions like Councilmanic Prerogative, the near-absolute power each of the city\u2019s 10 District Council members wield over development projects in their respective districts. It has in the past led to illegal acts\u2014former Council members George Schwartz, Rick Mariano and Leland Beloff all went to jail for shaking down developers\u2014but even when the privilege doesn\u2019t lead to extortion, it constantly reenforces that, when it comes to Philly, all politics are transactional. It\u2019s the product of an insider-dominated game, one in which the players seem to count on ho-hum reactions among voters to their brazen self-dealing.\n\nEarlier this month, another example of this Philly Way reared its misshapen head when Council began its seven weeks of budget hearings, with 15 separate agencies appearing before our august legislative body in order to justify their spending of taxpayer dollars. There is one such agency that will, as has long been customary, be exempt from such transparency: Council itself, which doesn\u2019t subject its own $17 million budget to public scrutiny. Kudos to The Inquirer\u2019s Chris Brennan for raising this issue. \u201cThere is no way else to view this,\u201d he writes. \u201cCouncil operates under a different set of rules than it enforces for the rest of Philadelphia\u2019s government.\u201d\n\nForget about the hearing. How about just publishing the itemized $17 million budget on Council\u2019s website? Put it up there for all to see\u2014in an easily understandable format. Why wouldn\u2019t you? You either believe you\u2019re a steward of the people\u2019s money\u2014or not.\n\nThis hypocrisy is not new. Back in 2012, Brennan worked for me at The Daily News, and he pressed Council President Darrell Clarke on it then; Clarke promised to \u201cenhance the ability for people to see what\u2019s in Council\u2019s budget,\u201d while refusing to say how. Five years later, I guess he\u2019s still working up that plan.\n\nWhat is Clarke hiding? As is so often the case in the insular world of Philly politics, he\u2019s looking out for his own little fiefdom. His Council budget, after all, is what enabled him to create a new position for his buddy, former Councilman Wilson Goode, Jr., after the electorate voted Goode out of office in 2015. Suddenly, Goode was back in City Hall, as Clarke\u2019s senior policy adviser, making $135,000 in taxpayer money\u2014$6,000 more than he was taking in as a Councilman.\n\nThat\u2019s how Philly works\u2014sweetheart deals from insiders for insiders, with hardly any transparency and even less accountability.\n\nWhen, earlier this month, Brennan raised the issue of their institutional hypocrisy to Council members, they disrespected your intelligence by feigning puzzlement: Just how could they be transparent about their own budget? \u201cMost of them focused on process,\u201d Brennan reported. \u201cWould Council ask itself questions, they wondered.\u201d\n\nNo doubt, it\u2019s a vexing issue. How could Council hold a hearing on its own budget? Who would ask the questions? It conjures up the courtroom scene in Woody Allen\u2019s brilliant Bananas, in which, at the four-minute mark below, Allen the lawyer questions Allen the defendant:\n\nWe hear you, Council. Holding a hearing on your own budget must be terribly complicated. So forget about the hearing. How about just publishing the itemized $17 million budget on Council\u2019s website? Put it up there for all to see\u2014in an easily understandable format. Why wouldn\u2019t you? You either believe you\u2019re a steward of the people\u2019s money\u2014or not. If the latter, at least have the guts to say to your voters that how you spend their money is none of their business."
