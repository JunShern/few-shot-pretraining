    "text": "Tag Archives: Easter\n\nHoly Week began yesterday morning with the waving of the palms. We stood outside our church on the corner of Ford Parkway and Macalester, savoring the little bit of sun that offered warmth against the bitter Minnesota cold. It may have been the first day of spring, but it was still in the 30s. We waved our palms to sing Hosanna, to fight back the cold, to celebrate the march toward Easter.\n\nSo with that backdrop I offer an Easter music list.\n\nI\u2019m always making mix CDs for my wife, and as I started another list for her, I realized I was collecting a lot of gospel songs. Most of my mixes are pretty random, so I decided to lean into the theme.\n\nThe result is a collection of music that speaks to faith and spirituality and hope and the gospel. I\u2019m well beyond saying this is \u201cChristian\u201d music, but it is a collection of hymns, psalms and laments, tinged with that old-time gospel sound.\n\n\u201cLittle Light\u201d by The Eagle Rock Gospel Singers\n\n\u201cWhat Wondrous Love Is This? by Chelsea Moon & The Franz Brothers\n\n\u201cNot Enough\u201d by Caedmon\u2019s Call\n\n\u201cHere it Comes\u201d by Romantica\n\n\u201cHe Never Said a Mumblin\u2019 Word\u201d by The Welcome Wagon\n\n\u201cThe Man Comes Around\u201d by Johnny Cash\n\n\u201cPurpose (live)\u201d by Cloud Cult\n\n\u201cHand in Hand\u201d by Jayanthi Kyle\n\n\u201cI Still Haven\u2019t Found What I\u2019m Looking For (Rattle & Hum movie version)\u201d by U2\n\n\u201cBe Thou My Vision\u201d by Ginny Owens\n\n\u201cAll the Poor and Powerless\u201d by All Sons & Daughters\n\n\u201cThe Transfiguration\u201d by Sufjan Stevens\n\n\u201cLamb of God, Have Mercy\u201d by Gospel Machine\n\n\u201cPeople of God\u201d by Gungor\n\n\u201cPoor Man\u2019s Son\u201d by Noah Gundersen\n\n\u201cThis Little Light\u201d by Mavis Staples\n\n\u201cThis No More\u201d by The Vespers\n\n\u201cAmazing Grace (featuring The Lily of the Valley Gospel Choir)\u201d by Justin McRoberts\n\nToday is Good Friday. It\u2019s the dark day of death before the resurrection at dawn on the third day. There\u2019s little good about it, as much as we make a case for its necessity. We can make the argument that it\u2019s good, but it\u2019s still a day of death most brutal. It\u2019d the day they crucified my Lord.\n\nO God, be merciful to me.\n\nIt\u2019s gray and dreary today. Windy and cold, spitting rain, threatening darkness. Everyone is asleep in the afternoon. Napping. What else can you do? As days off go, Good Friday isn\u2019t one to celebrate with loud acclaim. It\u2019s one to be mourned.\n\nFather, don\u2019t stop prayin\u2019. For this old world is almost done.\n\nGood Friday is about waiting. Waiting for Sunday to come. Waiting for hope to break through. Waiting for light to shine. Always waiting. Humanity is plunged into the dark night of the soul, with nothing to do but wait. I grow so tired of the waiting. I want to plunge forward with reckless abandon, but it\u2019s not in my power to do. I can only wait.\n\nWe nailed him on to a tree, but he never said a mumblin\u2019 word. Not a word, not a word, not a word.\n\nGood Friday is a paradox. Thankfully it escaped the Hallmark treatment. The Easter bunny and the eggs have left it alone, for what could you even do with it? This year it coincides with Earth Day, fitting to some and awful to others, but there it is.\n\nAnd when from death I\u2019m free, I\u2019ll sing on, I\u2019ll sing on; And when from death I\u2019m free, I\u2019ll sing on and joyful be.\n\nIt\u2019s a day of quiet contemplation, a day to ponder these things that I\u2019ve done. We are scattered and lost and in such desperate need of that Sunday morning. When will it come? When will it come? Christmas has the child-like expectation, but for Easter it\u2019s something more. Something deeper. Something urgent.\n\nLike a wayward child I\u2019ve wandered\u2026 I have wandered in the darkness, and my path was lone and drear. But my Father did not leave me, he was watching ever near. Lord I\u2019m coming home, Lord I\u2019m coming home.\n\nI love church on Easter Sunday. It\u2019s a party. The music rocks harder. People dance. Everybody comes in smiling. And after six weeks of a quiet, somber end to church, we get to say Alleluia again.\n\nLast year Milo banished us to the cry room and Lexi threw a fit when we went up for communion. This year Milo seemed to want to sing in the choir, even though we don\u2019t have a choir. Lexi did fine at communion, pausing to lean Pinky against the kneeler before she stood at the communion rail. After church I didn\u2019t have much time to talk to anyone because Milo made a beeline for the door and we spent a while playing in the grass.\n\nThis year the sermon closed with a reading of John Updike\u2019s \u201cSeven Stanzas at Easter.\u201d I\u2019d never heard it before and find Updike to be very hit or miss, but this was good. The poem focused on the importance of Christ\u2019s bodily ressurrection\u2014that Jesus literally came back from the dead. Updike focus more on the reality of it, but a few lines reminded me of the very Buffy the Vampire Slayer nature of the ressurrection. The grave was empty. The body was gone. And he was walking around. Not all putrified zombie corpse, but whole and restored. That\u2019s crazy. And that\u2019s the point. From Updike:\n\nLet us not mock God with metaphor,\nanalogy, sidestepping, transcendence;\nmaking of the event a parable, a sign painted in the\nfaded credulity of earlier ages:\nlet us walk through the door. \u2026\n\nLet us not seek to make it less monstrous,\nfor our own convenience, our own sense of beauty,\nlest, awakened in one unthinkable hour, we are\nembarrassed by the miracle,\nand crushed by remonstrance.\n\nEaster Sunday. The day more people show up in church than any other day. And this morning was no exception.\n\nEveryone comes out, dressed up in the best they have. I don\u2019t quite understand that, either an attempt to out-do one another, or trying to show God just how good we are. Look at me in my three piece suit. Check out my snazzy Easter Bonnet. I must be good if I\u2019m dressed this nice. Is this some kind of left over Puritan tradition, or did Jesus really put on his sharpest tunic before clearing the temple?\n\nI also find it odd that little or no attempt is made to make things understandable to the \u201cunchurched\u201d person. At my church every Bible passage was read from the Kings James Version, which even to my \u201cChristian\u201d ears sounded undecipherable. Before the offering was taken, my pastor told the visitors that they need not give. He explained that the people of the church had committed themselves to a budget, and this was how they met that budget. Of course then he went on to say that it\u2019s everyone\u2019s rightful duty to give\u2013effectively undoing what he had just said. And then there was the responsive reading. We had just finished singing \u201cHe Lives,\u201d and before beginning, the man leading the responsive reading said, \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t believe he lives, here\u2019s proof,\u201d and he proceeded to read the passages describing Christ\u2019s resurrection (again in the archaic King James Version). Now certainly to a Christian, that\u2019s proof. But he was clearly talking to the unsaved that were there that day. Proof? Quoting Bible verses at somebody is proof? I couldn\u2019t help but question that.\n\nYou can tell I had a rather cynical attitude the entire time. And what happened? How effective was this sub-par outreach? After the sermon, two people came forwarded and accepted Christ, two more had raised their hands, but didn\u2019t want to come forward, and nearly a dozen raised their hands asking for prayer in dealing with spiritual issues in their lives. Perhaps I should shut my cynical mouth, and realize that God is going to work no matter how things are done. Of course that doesn\u2019t mean we should put no work into a service, thinking that God will work despite our laziness. But perhaps it does mean that I should be a little less judgmental of what I think is a church service that doesn\u2019t speak to the unsaved.\n\nA work-at-home dad wrestles with faith, social justice & story.\n\nThe personal site of Kevin D.
