The government appeals from an order of the district\n\ncourt suppressing incriminating statements made by Defendant Honey Lynn Wolfe (\u201cWolfe\u201d or\n\n\u201cDefendant\u201d) during a murder investigation of an infant on a U.S. Army base. The issue presented\n\nis whether the taint from a temporary detention was sufficiently attenuated that Defendant\u2019s\n\nsubsequent incriminating statements are admissible in evidence. We hold that it was, and reverse\n\nand remand for further proceedings.\n\n                                        I. Background\n\n       Defendant, the wife of an American soldier stationed in Korea, was babysitting three-month-\n\nold infant Braydon Grover on the morning of August 6, 2002, at her home on the U.S. Army base\n\nat Fort Campbell, Kentucky. Braydon\u2019s mother was stationed at Fort Campbell. At approximately\n\n\n\n       *\n       The Honorable Joseph M. Hood, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of\nKentucky, sitting by designation.\n\f10:30 a.m., Defendant called 911 to report that the child had stopped breathing. Paramedics were\n\ndispatched to the scene. They transported the child to the base hospital, where he was pronounced\n\ndead. At approximately 10:45 a.m., Military Policeman Sergeant Steven Wentzel arrived to\n\ninvestigate. According to Wentzel, Defendant told him that she had put the baby to sleep \u201cat 0600\n\nhours, and placed it face down, boxed in with blankets, because that\u2019s the way the baby likes to\n\nsleep.\u201d \u201cShe then said that she checked on the baby right before she called 911, because it wasn\u2019t\n\nbreathing.\u201d \u201c[S]he said at 0730 was the last time she heard the baby cry, because the baby would\n\ncry when it wasn\u2019t sleeping.\u201d Wentzel stated that Defendant told him that it normally took the baby\n\nabout an hour to fall asleep and that \u201cif it wasn\u2019t sleeping it was always crying.\u201d The military\n\npolicemen secured the scene until agents from the Central Investigations Command (\u201cCID\u201d) arrived.\n\n       CID Special Agent David Maier arrived at about 11:50 a.m. After being briefed by the\n\nmilitary policemen, Maier asked Defendant if he could speak to her, and she agreed. She further\n\nagreed to go back to his office to discuss the matter. Maier stated that he did not tell Defendant that\n\nshe had to go to the CID office. Maier did not read Defendant her Miranda rights at any point.\n\n       Military police escorted Defendant to the CID office, which is about five minutes away from\n\nher home. Defendant was placed in the interview suite. Defendant waited there approximately two\n\nhours. The interview began about 2:00 p.m. Maier did not read Defendant her Miranda rights,\n\nbecause in his view, \u201cto that point there was nothing that led me to believe that she had committed\n\nany crime.\u201d\n\n       During the course of the interview, one of Maier\u2019s colleagues, Agent Shawn Burke, returned\n\nfrom the hospital with pictures of the baby, which had been taken at 11:56 a.m. The photographs\n\nshowed lividity (pooled blood) on both the back and front of the baby. Maier felt that the\n\n\n                                                 -2-\n\fphotographs raised \u201cinconsistencies with the information that she had given me up until that point\n\ndealing with the time line and the way that she found the child and how that was inconsistent with\n\nthe lividity found on the child.\u201d Maier decided to advise Defendant of her Miranda rights, utilizing\n\na DA form 3881, military rights waiver. Defendant stated that she understood her rights and\n\nexecuted the waiver. The interview ended around 4:30 p.m.\n\n       FBI Special Agent Franklin Charles also interviewed Defendant. Charles asked Defendant\n\nif she would be willing to come back to the FBI office and take a polygraph examination, and\n\nDefendant assented. She further agreed to wait the three hours it would take for the polygraph\n\nexaminer, FBI Special Agent Carl Christiansen, to arrive.\n\n       Charles\u2019 interview with Defendant ended at about 4:30 p.m. While waiting to be transported\n\nto the FBI office to take the polygraph examination, Defendant was kept in a locked holding area,\n\nwhich consisted of a room approximately seven feet by twenty feet with a bench. She was allowed\n\nto take smoking and bathroom breaks outside the room.\n\n       The FBI asked Maier to get a written statement from Defendant, which he took at\n\napproximately 6:40 p.m. Defendant\u2019s statement read: \u201cI got drilled and questioned about what\n\nhappened. Then they demanded a lie detector test. Now I\u2019m writing\u2013now I\u2019m waiting on that. I\n\nhave told the whole truth. No one believes me.\u201d\n\n       At approximately 7:30 p.m., a CID officer transported Defendant to the FBI office. Agent\n\nCharles, who was waiting for Defendant, introduced her to the polygraph examiner, Agent\n\nChristiansen. Christiansen testified that he made Defendant aware that she was not under arrest, and\n\nthat \u201cno matter what happened that evening she was not going to be arrested.\u201d Defendant signed\n\n\n\n\n                                                -3-\n\fa consent form.1 Christiansen also advised Defendant of her Miranda rights and she signed another\n\nform identifying those rights and waiving them, agreeing \u201cto answer questions without a lawyer\n\npresent.\u201d The questioning and advice prior to the commencement of the polygraph examination took\n\napproximately an hour and a half. The polygraph examination itself lasted approximately fifteen\n\nminutes. The room where the questioning and examination took place was locked from the outside,\n\nbut anyone inside the room could get out.\n\n       After Christiansen analyzed the results of the polygraph examination, he concluded\n\nDefendant was lying about the day\u2019s events. Christiansen told Defendant that, in his opinion, she\n\nwas not being truthful, and that he \u201cwanted to talk to her about that and try to figure out why she\n\ndidn\u2019t do well on the test.\u201d Christiansen then questioned her for several more hours. Christiansen\n\nsaid that Defendant changed her story a number of times during this period of questioning, but that\n\nshe eventually told him that she may have wrapped the baby so tight in a blanket that it stopped\n\nbreathing.2 At this point, Christiansen called Agent Charles into the room. Christiansen asked\n\n\n\n\n       1\n         The consent form explained: \u201cYou have the right to refuse to take the polygraph test. If you\nagree to take the polygraph test, you have the right to stop the test at any time. If you agree to take\nthe polygraph test, you have the right to refuse to answer any individual questions.\u201d The consent\nform also contained the following acknowledgments: \u201cI have read this statement of my rights and\nI understand what my rights are. I voluntarily agree to be examined by means of the polygraph\nduring this interview. I understand what I am doing. No threats or promises have been used against\nme to obtain my consent to use the polygraph.\u201d\n       2\n         The district court noted that in his notes, Christiansen recorded that Defendant agreed with\nhim that she was in bed sleeping and that she snapped when the baby was crying and suffocated him.\nDuring the suppression hearing, however, Christiansen stated that Defendant volunteered the\nstatement, rather than merely agreeing with his statement of the purported events. The court noted\nthat Christiansen\u2019s choice of words in his notes was ambiguous, in that one could agree with a\nstatement and also freely volunteer a statement. On the other hand, \u201cthe choice could have\nsignificance.\u201d The court also found that there was a credibility issue\u2013namely between Christiansen\u2019s\naccount that Defendant\u2019s denial that she made a confession at all.\n\n                                                 -4-\n\fDefendant to repeat to Charles what she allegedly had told to him. Defendant refused to say\n\nanything and the interview was terminated, at approximately 3:00 a.m.\n\n       On November 5, 2003, Defendant was indicted on one count of second-degree murder, in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1111. Defendant moved to suppress all statements that she made to the\n\ninvestigators. The government opposed the motion, arguing that Defendant\u2019s \u201ctemporary detention\u201d\n\nat the CID office \u201cwas supported by probable cause\u201d and that \u201cher statements to law enforcement\n\nauthorities . . . should be admitted because they were entirely voluntary and consistent with her\n\nwritten waivers of her Miranda rights.\u201d\n\n       After holding an evidentiary hearing, the district court granted Defendant\u2019s motion to\n\nsuppress. The court found that Defendant \u201cvoluntarily agreed to go\u201d to the CID office and was not\n\nunder arrest when she was transported to the CID. The district court further found that Defendant\n\nwas placed in custody when her Miranda rights were read to her at about 2:25 p.m.\n\n       The district court held that the government did not have probable cause to arrest Defendant\n\nat that time. Specifically, the court determined that the photographs of the baby showing pooled\n\nblood on both the baby\u2019s front and back were \u201cnot sufficient to establish probable cause,\u201d because\n\n\u201cthey did not show that Ms. Wolfe had done anything wrong nor . . . lead to a reasonable conclusion\n\nthat Ms. Wolfe\u2019s statements were inconsistent.\u201d The court held that the prosecution had not\n\nidentified what statements made by Defendant led Maier to believe that she was not telling the truth,\n\nand, in fact, Maier had actually testified that Defendant \u201c\u2018continued to provide [him] the same time\n\nlines of her story for the duration of [his] portion of the interview.\u2019\u201d Thus, the district court ruled\n\nthat the prosecution had not met its burden of showing that there were inconsistencies within\n\nDefendant\u2019s statements to justify Maier\u2019s finding of probable cause. The district court therefore\n\n\n                                                 -5-\n\fconcluded that Defendant was the victim of an illegal arrest that lacked probable cause, and that, as\n\na result, her subsequent statements must be suppressed.\n\n       Although it suppressed Defendant\u2019s statements, the district court also made a finding that\n\nthey were voluntary under the Fifth Amendment. The court felt that the length of the interrogation,\n\nthe location of the interrogation, and the continuity of the interrogation were all factors that weighed\n\nin favor of finding the alleged confession was involuntary, but that the totality of the circumstances,\n\ndid not demonstrate that Ms. Wolfe was coerced into an alleged confession. \u201cMs. Wolfe was read\n\nher Miranda rights, she was not mistreated in anyway [sic], she had a high school degree with some\n\ncollege education, she was 31 years old and married, and there is no basis for finding that the\n\nofficers used coercive techniques.\u201d The court granted the motion to suppress, however, \u201cbecause\n\nMs. Wolfe was arrested without probable cause.\u201d\n\n       The government moved for reconsideration, arguing that even if Defendant had been illegally\n\narrested at the CID office, her statements at the FBI office were purged of any taint of that illegality\n\nbecause of intervening events and the passage of time, so that her subsequent statements to the FBI\n\npolygraph examiner should be admissible. The district court denied the government\u2019s motion for\n\nreconsideration. The district court stated in pertinent part:\n\n               The Supreme Court found that police misconduct . . . does not have to include\n       physical abuse or a confession that was involuntary under the Fifth Amendment.\n       Taylor v. Alabama, 457 U.S. 687, 693 (1982). Instead, it is enough that an\n       interrogation takes place \u201cin the hope that something would turn up.\u201d Id. That is\n       exactly what happened in this case. Ms. Wolfe was interrogated for hours by several\n       different investigators hoping that they would get a \u201cbreakthrough.\u201d The Supreme\n       Court also noted that a longer length of time does not make a significant impact as\n       an intervening circumstance where as here the defendant was in polic[e] custody,\n       unrepresented by counsel, and questioned on several occasions. Id. at 691. After\n       2:25 p.m., Ms. Wolfe was in continuous custody and was being transported by\n       officers, locked in a cell, interrogated, or [sic] given a break upon her request. Ms.\n       Wolfe was not represented by counsel. In contrast to the Government\u2019s assertion\n\n                                                  -6-\n\f       that Ms. Wolfe should have felt she was free to go, when Ms. Wolfe was asked to\n       make a statement, she stated that the officers had demanded that she take a\n       polygraph. No intervening circumstances have purged the taint from Ms. Wolfe\u2019s\n       illegal arrest.\n\n               The United States appeals both rulings.\n\n                                            II. Analysis\n\n                                     A. Standard of Review\n\n       This court reviews a district court\u2019s findings of fact in a suppression hearing for clear error\n\nand its conclusions of law de novo. United States v. Lopez-Arias, 344 F.3d 623, 627 (6th Cir. 2003).\n\n\n\n                                             B. Merits\n\n       The government concedes that Defendant was unlawfully detained at the CID office when\n\nshe was kept in a locked room for several hours while she waited to be transported to the FBI office\n\nto take the polygraph examination. The government further assumes for purposes of this appeal that\n\nthere were insufficient grounds to detain her at that time. Notwithstanding, the government argues\n\nthat Defendant\u2019s inculpatory statements were not causally related to her period of detention at the\n\nCID office. Specifically, the government maintains that even if Defendant was unlawfully detained\n\nwhen she was held in a locked room at the CID office, the admissions she made at the FBI office\n\napproximately six hours later, after she failed the polygraph examination, were not the fruit of that\n\nunlawful detention. The government claims that the mild nature of the detention and its benign\n\npurpose, as well as the events intervening between that detention and Defendant\u2019s admissions,\n\nestablish that her admissions were sufficient acts of free will to purge the taint of any unlawful\n\ndetention. See Brown v. Illinois, 422 U.S. 590, 602 (1975).\n\n\n\n\n                                                -7-\n\f       An illegal detention or arrest does not render all subsequently discovered evidence\n\ninadmissible per se. Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471 (1963). Rather, the question is\n\n\u201cwhether, granting establishment of the primary illegality, the evidence . . . has been come at by\n\nexploitation of that illegality or instead by means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the\n\nprimary taint.\u201d Id. at 488 (quotation omitted). Thus, a confession obtained through custodial\n\ninterrogation following an illegal arrest in violation of the Fourth Amendment must be excluded\n\nfrom evidence unless the confession was \u201c\u2018sufficiently an act of free will to purge the primary\n\ntaint.\u2019\u201d Brown, 422 U.S. at 602 (quoting Wong Sun, 371 U.S. at 486).\n\n       The threshold requirement for admissibility under Brown is that the confession must have\n\nbeen voluntary for purposes of the Fifth Amendment. Id. at 601-02. The Brown Court also\n\narticulated a number of factors that a court should take into account in determining the admissibility\n\nof a confession following a custodial arrest:\n\n       The Miranda warnings are an important factor, to be sure, in determining whether the\n       confession is obtained by exploitation of an illegal arrest. But they are not the only\n       factors to be considered. The temporal proximity of the arrest and the confession,\n       the presence of intervening circumstances, and, particularly, the purpose and\n       flagrancy of the official misconduct are all relevant.\n\nBrown, 422 U.S. at 603-04 (internal citations omitted). The government has the burden of proving\n\nthe admissibility of a confession following an illegal arrest. Kaupp v. Texas, 538 U.S. 626, 633\n\n(2003) (per curiam)\n\n                                         1. Voluntariness\n\n       As noted, the threshold issue for admission under Brown is that the confession must have\n\nbeen voluntary for purposes of the Fifth Amendment. Brown, 422 U.S. at 602; accord United States\n\nv. Reed, 349 F.3d 457, 463 (7th Cir. 2003). The district court found that Defendant\u2019s incriminatory\n\n\n                                                 -8-\n\fstatements at the FBI office were voluntary under Fifth Amendment principles. As noted above, the\n\ncourt ruled that the totality of the circumstances did not demonstrate that Defendant was coerced into\n\nan alleged confession because she received her Miranda warnings, was not mistreated or subjected\n\nto coercive tactics, and has a high school education. Defendant does not contest this ruling. Thus,\n\nthis factor supports the admission of Defendant\u2019s alleged confession.\n\n       With this in mind, we turn to the other Brown factors.\n\n                                     2. Temporal Proximity\n\n       Before discussing the second Brown factor, we must consider the government\u2019s argument\n\nconcerning the establishment of the primary illegality, namely that Defendant was not in custody\n\nuntil around 4:30 p.m., when she was placed in the locked holding cell, and not at 2:30 p.m., after\n\nshe was shown the photographs and read her Miranda rights, as the district court held.\n\n                                           a. In Custody\n\n       First, the government challenges the district court\u2019s ruling that Defendant was \u201cin custody\n\nby the time Agent Maier gave her the Miranda warnings at 2:25 p.m.\u201d The government contends\n\nthat Defendant was not detained prior to being confined in the locked holding area at the CID office.\n\n       While it is true that Miranda warnings are required when \u201ca suspect\u2019s freedom of action is\n\ncurtailed to a \u2018degree associated with a formal arrest,\u2019\u201d Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U.S. 420, 440\n\n(1984) (quoting California v. Beheler, 463 U.S. 1121, 1125 (1983) (per curiam)), the mere reading\n\nof Miranda warnings does not convert a noncustodial interview into a custodial interrogation,\n\nUnited States v. Lewis, 556 F.2d 446, 449 (6th Cir. 1977) (per curiam) (\u201cThe precaution of giving\n\nMiranda rights in what is thought could be a non-custodial interview should not be deterred by\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -9-\n\finterpreting the giving of such rights as a restraint on the suspect, converting a non-custodial\n\ninterview into a custodial interrogation for Miranda purposes.\u201d).\n\n       The district court\u2019s ruling that Defendant was in custody at the CID office when she was read\n\nher Miranda rights at approximately 2:25 p.m. was based on the view that custody resulted from\n\nMaier\u2019s act of giving those warnings and Maier\u2019s subjective belief that he had probable cause to\n\narrest her. This ruling is contrary to both Lewis and Berkemer. See Berkemer, 468 U.S. at 442\n\n(officer\u2019s subjective intention \u201chas no bearing on the question whether a suspect is \u2018in custody\u2019\u201d).3\n\nAlso, the fact Maier confronted Defendant with the photographs and indicated that he thought she\n\nwas lying also does not, without more, transform the encounter into a custodial interrogation. Cf.\n\nOregon v. Mathiason, 429 U.S. 492, 495-96 (1977) (per curiam) (stating that an officer\u2019s false\n\nstatement about having discovered the suspect\u2019s fingerprints at the scene had \u201cnothing to do with\n\nwhether respondent was in custody for purposes of the Miranda rule\u201d).\n\n       Further, nothing in the record suggests that a reasonable person in Defendant\u2019s position\n\nwould believe that he or she was being detained or compelled to answer Maier\u2019s questions. Rather,\n\nthe record shows that Maier\u2019s interview with Defendant, even after Maier gave her the Miranda\n\nwarnings, was \u201ca calm exchange between two people trying to ascertain what had happened.\u201d Cf.\n\nUnited States v. Drayton, 536 U.S. 194, 204 (2002) (holding that an encounter was consensual,\n\n\n\n       3\n         Defendant contends that Lewis is distinguishable because the suspect in that case came by\nhimself to the interview, was given his Miranda warnings prior to any discussion, and no new\ninformation was presented during the questioning. See Lewis, 556 F.2d at 447. Here, by contrast,\nDefendant was taken to the CID office in her pajamas and questioned for some time before Maier\nread Defendant her Miranda warnings and confronted her with the pictures of the dead child.\nDefendant\u2019s argument must be rejected. Most importantly, the district court found as a matter of\nfact that Defendant voluntarily accompanied the officers to the CID office. Thus, the fact that she\ndid not drive herself is immaterial.\n\n                                                -10-\n\fdespite the suspect\u2019s subjective belief that he must cooperate, because the officers did nothing that\n\nobjectively made the encounter coercive: \u201cno application of force, no intimidating movement, no\n\noverwhelming show of force, no brandishing of weapons, no blocking of exits, no threat, no\n\ncommand, not even an authoritative tone of voice\u201d).\n\n                                    b. Temporal Relationship\n\n       Brown also directs courts to consider the temporal proximity of the arrest and the confession.\n\nBrown, 422 U.S. at 603. However, \u201cthere is no \u2018bright-line\u2019 test for temporal proximity.\u201d United\n\nStates v. Reed, 349 F.3d 457, 463 (7th Cir. 2003) (citations omitted). Here, the time between the\n\ninitiation of the illegal detention and the alleged confession was almost ten hours. Although longer\n\nthan the period of time in Brown, see Brown, 422 U.S. at 604-05 (less than two hour interval\n\nbetween illegal arrest and first statement with no intervening event \u201cof significance whatsoever\u201d not\n\nsufficient to cure taint), and Dunaway, see Dunaway v. New York, 442 U.S. 200, 218 (1979) (two\n\nhour interval with no intervening event of significance; holding that taint was not cured), the time\n\nframe here is still within the ambit of that in Taylor, see Taylor v. Alabama, 457 U.S. 687, 691\n\n(1982) (holding that six hour length of time between illegal arrest and confession was not a\n\nsignificant amount of time to break the connection between the illegal arrest and the petitioner\u2019s\n\nconfession where the petitioner was in police custody, without counsel, was questioned on several\n\noccasions, fingerprinted, and subjected to a lineup). We therefore consider the temporal proximity\n\nfactor in conjunction with any intervening circumstances. See Reed, 349 F.3d at 464.\n\n                                 3. Intervening Circumstances\n\n       Next, Brown directs courts to consider whether any circumstances intervened between the\n\ninitial detention and the challenged statements. As noted, the Supreme Court has observed that the\n\n\n                                                -11-\n\fmere giving of Miranda warnings does not sufficiently break the connection between the illegal\n\ndetention and the confession or search. Taylor, 457 U.S. at 691 (holding that three Miranda\n\nwarnings did not sufficiently purge the taint of the illegal arrest). Instead, there must be present\n\nintervening events that sever the causal connection between the illegal arrest or search and the\n\ndiscovery of the incriminating evidence. See, e.g., Rawlings v. Kentucky, 448 U.S. 98,108-09 (1980)\n\n(discovery of other incriminating evidence was attenuating circumstance); Wong Sun, 371 U.S. at\n\n491 (holding that confession made several days after illegal arrest and preceded by arraignment and\n\nrelease from custody was admissible); cf. Reed, 349 F.3d at 464 (holding that non-confrontational\n\ninterviews between the defendant and police, and the defendant\u2019s periods of solitary reflection\n\ncombined with fact that confession occurred within six hours of illegal arrest was not sufficient to\n\nsever the connection).\n\n       The government claims that there are two intervening events of significance. First, it claims\n\nthat Defendant\u2019s unlawful detention ended when she arrived at the FBI office and was told by\n\nChristiansen that she was not under arrest, that she was free to leave at any time, and that she would\n\nnot be arrested in any event. Second, the government claims that Defendant\u2019s admissions were the\n\nresult of being told that she failed the polygraph examination, which she voluntarily agreed to take,\n\nand not the result of her detention at the CID office.\n\n        The district court did not address the events at the FBI office, but simply held that Defendant\n\nwas in continuous custody after 2:25 p.m. Defendant, for her part, states that she did not consent\n\nto take a polygraph, pointing to her handwritten statement that the officers \u201cdemanded\u201d a polygraph.\n\nNonetheless, Defendant did sign a \u201cConsent to Interview With Polygraph\u201d form, which explicitly\n\nprovided that: \u201cI voluntarily agree to be examined by means of the polygraph. . . . No threats or\n\n\n                                                -12-\n\fpromises have been used against me to obtain my consent.\u201d Furthermore, and most importantly, as\n\nthe district court found, Defendant agreed to take the polygraph examination and further agreed to\n\nwait three hours for the polygraph examiner to arrive. We hold that these voluntary decisions by\n\nDefendant \u2013to take the polygraph examination (both times), and to wait three hours for the\n\npolygraph examiner\u2013were acts of free will sufficient to purge the taint of the illegal arrest.\n\n       The government cites as the second intervening circumstance the polygraph examination,\n\nor more precisely, Defendant\u2019s reaction to the results of the polygraph examination. It is apparent\n\nthat Defendant\u2019s allegedly incriminatory admissions were triggered by the information that she\n\nfailed the polygraph examination, and not by the fact that she was illegally detained for three hours\n\nwhile voluntarily waiting for the polygraph examiner nearly ten hours earlier. She maintained her\n\nexculpatory explanation throughout the day to each of the officers who questioned her, including\n\nChristiansen. Defendant only allegedly began to change her story after Christiansen told her she had\n\nfailed the polygraph examination. Furthermore, she had no difficulty ending the interview at 3:00\n\na.m. In short, as the district court found this was not a situation were \u201ca defendant\u2019s will [had] been\n\novercome and a false confession obtained.\u201d\n\n       In sum, we conclude that Defendant\u2019s consent to take the polygraph examination, both at\n\n4:30 p.m. and again when she signed the consent form, and her agreement to wait three hours for\n\nthe examiner, were \u201cintervening independent act[s] of free will to purge the primary taint\u201d of the\n\nillegal detention. The district court erred in concluding otherwise.\n\n                        4. Purpose and Flagrancy of Police Misconduct\n\n       Fourth, Brown requires consideration of the purpose and flagrancy of the official misconduct.\n\nBrown, 422 U.S. at 604. This factor is considered \u201cparticularly\u201d important, see Brown, 422 U.S. at\n\n\n                                                 -13-\n\f604; United States v. Fazio, 914 F.2d 950, 958 (7th Cir. 1990) (citing Brown), because it is linked\n\ndirectly to the rationale underlying the exclusionary rule\u2013deterrence of police misconduct, Reed,\n\n349 F.3d at 465 (citing Brown, 422 U.S. at 600); Reed, 349 F.3d at 464-65; Fazio, 914 F.2d at 958.\n\nRelevant considerations include whether \u201cthe arrest, both in design and in execution, was\n\ninvestigatory,\u201d Brown, 422 U.S. at 605, and also whether the arrest was calculated \u201cto cause\n\nsurprise, fright, and confusion,\u201d id.\n\n        This factor weighs against suppression. Defendant was not questioned during the period she\n\nwas illegally detained, and she was not questioned at the FBI office until after she was again advised\n\nthat she was not under arrest. Cf. Taylor, 457 U.S. at 691 (finding purposeful misconduct because\n\nin a six-hour period between the illegal arrest and confession, the petitioner was unrepresented by\n\ncounsel, questioned on several occasions, fingerprinted, and subjected to a lineup). The conditions\n\nof Defendant\u2019s detention in the locked holding area at the CID office were mild. She was never\n\nplaced under arrest, handcuffed, or even placed in a traditional cell. It is clear that the purpose of\n\nthis detention was merely to await the arrival of the polygraph examiner at the FBI office, and\n\nDefendant had already agreed to undergo a polygraph examination. Thus, the police misconduct\n\nin this case was not flagrant or purposeful in the sense that the officers used the period of the illegal\n\ndetention to procure a confession.\n\n        This was not a situation where the defendant was unlawfully detained for interrogation in\n\nthe hope that something would \u201cturn up.\u201d See Kaupp, 538 U.S. at 628-33 (officers removed the\n\npetitioner from his home in the middle of the night without any probable cause); Taylor, 457 U.S.\n\nat 693 (finding flagrancy in the fact that police effectuated an investigatory arrest without probable\n\ncause, based on an uncorroborated informant\u2019s tip, and involuntarily transported the defendant to\n\n\n                                                  -14-\n\fthe police station for interrogation in the hope that \u201csomething would turn up\u201d); Dunaway, 457 U.S.\n\nat 218 (holding that the petitioner was seized without probable cause based only on a tip from a jail\n\ninmate that admittedly did not supply enough information to obtain a warrant, brought to police\n\nheadquarters and placed in an interrogation room where he was questioned \u201cin the hope that\n\nsomething might turn up,\u201d and confessed without any intervening circumstances); Brown, 422 U.S.\n\nat 605 (finding that the illegality had a quality of purposefulness, that the impropriety of the arrest\n\nwas obvious from the detectives\u2019 concession that the arrest was investigatory; officers admitted lack\n\nof any probable cause to arrest, let alone remove suspect from his residence); cf. Lopez-Arias, 344\n\nF.3d at 630 (finding that illegality of the arrest was \u201cblatant,\u201d and cases discussed therein).\n\nDefendant was the only eye witness to the alleged crime, and was therefore naturally a suspect. She\n\nvolunteered at the outset that the baby had been crying. Even at that, as the district court found,\n\ninitially the officers did not detain her in any way, and she voluntarily agreed to go to the CID office\n\nto make a statement. She was seated in the waiting room until Maier arrived at the CID office.\n\n       Most importantly, Defendant was not questioned during the three-hour period when she\n\nwaited for the polygraph examiner to arrive. Under these circumstances, it cannot be said that the\n\nillegal detention was an attempt to obtain evidence by \u201cexploitation.\u201d See Fazio, 914 F.2d at 958.\n\n\u201cBecause the primary purpose of the exclusionary rule is to discourage police misconduct,\n\napplication of the rule does not serve this deterrent function when the police action, although\n\nerroneous, was not undertaken in an effort to benefit the police at the expense of the suspect\u2019s\n\nprotected rights.\u201d Id. As in Rawlings, \u201cthe conduct of the police here does not rise to the level of\n\nconscious or flagrant misconduct requiring prophylactic exclusion of petitioner\u2019s statements.\u201d\n\nRawlings, 448 U.S. at 110.\n\n\n                                                 -15-\n\f        Defendant\u2019s illegal detention lacks the \u201cquality of purposefulness\u201d condemned in Brown.\n\nSee Brown, 422 U.S. at 605. Nor do the circumstances indicate that the manner of Defendant\u2019s\n\ndetention was \u201ccalculated to cause surprise, fright, or confusion.\u201d Id. In short, this factor, the \u201cmost\n\nimportant\u201d factor, Reed, 349 F.3d at 464, reinforces the conclusion that Defendant\u2019s alleged\n\nstatements4 were the act of free will and not the product of an illegal detention.\n\n                                           III. Conclusion\n\n        For the foregoing reasons, this matter is REVERSED and REMANDED for further\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n        4\n         As the district court observed, there is a credibility issue on this point that can be presented\nto the finder of fact.\n\n                                                  -16-\n\f"
