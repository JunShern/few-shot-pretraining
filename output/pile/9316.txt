    "text": "Today Microsoft unveiled the Xbox One at its Redmond, Washington campus. As the battle for the living room rages on, Microsoft has won a decisive victory that puts it well ahead of the competition.\n\nThe Xbox One is just as much for all-around entertainment as it is for gaming, perhaps even more so. It\u2019s designed to be the one box that sits below your TV and does everything: games, movies, live TV, music, surfing the web, messaging, and even video calling. Minority Report-style gestures control the experience, it can recognize your face when you walk in the room, and you can talk to it like Siri on steroids.\n\nShould Apple be worried? The answer is no, at least not yet.\n\nThe Xbox One demonstrates how to play to an audience. And that audience isn\u2019t the same as Apple\u2019s.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft has included everything but the kitchen sink.\u201d\n\nWhile the Xbox One certainly looks like a fantastic entertainment hub, it would totally overwhelm my mother. Microsoft has included everything but the kitchen sink. To go from a traditional remote + controller combo to pinch and pull gestures with voice commands is quite the leap, even for a tech nerd.\n\nIf you use Netflix, get pumped for the new Call of Duty, and are hooked into Xbox Live, then the One console is a no-brainer. It\u2019s a product that will instantly appease hip, young techies and gamers. The entertainment system aspect is definitely there, but the Xbox is still based on the foundation of console gaming. That won\u2019t change, and that ultimately limits Microsoft\u2019s reach.\n\n\u201cContent is king for Apple.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, the Apple TV is for everyone. You can mirror iOS games to the big screen, but the crux of the product is not built around gaming at all. Playing games is just one part of the Apple TV experience. The Apple TV is ultimately designed for watching and listening to stuff. Content is king for Apple. It always will be.\n\nXbox One owners will have little need for an Apple TV, unless the ability to use AirPlay is of great value. But most people won\u2019t be buying a more expensive Xbox One instead of a $99 Apple TV.\n\nIf the Apple TV doesn\u2019t get new features or replaced entirely over the next couple years, there are going to be problems. Competitors like Microsoft are piecing together what it takes to create a modern living room experience. Apple hasn\u2019t solved it yet, and today Microsoft got closer.\n\nOne of the Xbox One\u2019s coolest features is the ability to instantly recognize a person\u2019s face and track command gestures with the Kinect sensor bar. That combined with voice support for navigating creates a pretty compelling, futuristic experience. We reported that Apple was prototyping the same kind of features in a HDTV last year. Little is known about Apple\u2019s current plans for TV, other than the fact that the company has desperately been trying to secure licensing deals for streaming live programming. A standalone \u2018iTV\u2019 panel could be involved, or the current Apple TV could be turned into the internet-connected, app-ready, TV guide/DVR you\u2019ve always wished you had.\n\nThe Apple TV hasn\u2019t received a major, fundamental change since it was released in 2006. Sure, the box has been made slimmer and sleeker. The interface has changed, and a few app-like channels have been added, but the hockey puck is still pretty much the same. Apple has called it a \u201chobby\u201d for years, although recent comments from Tim Cook suggest that something more is brewing.\n\nThis living room stuff takes time. It\u2019s been nearly eight years since the Xbox 360. I wonder how long it will take Apple.\n\nJust wait, Apple will re-invent the TV industry because Steve Jobs has finally cracked it.\n\nvanstatten\n\nHahaha yeahh he cracked it, another sht from apple fan..\n\nSteven Quan\n\nHow is Microsoft closer to making the modern living room experience?\n\nOnline gaming \u2013 Ok, I\u2019ll give you this one. Fancy voice interface, Kinect, Xbox Live, Apple has no equivalent for the online gaming experience, but not everyone is a gamer, it\u2019s a niche market.\n\nTV \u2013 The Xbox can stream movies, tv shows and music, and so does the Apple TV, but the Apple TV is able to do a better job in this category as you can use iPhone or iPad to interface with it and this cannot be done with Windows Phone. It\u2019s close, but Apple gets a slight nod here in my book but you could go with Microsoft just as easily because of it\u2019s advanced interface.\n\nLights \u2013 The Hue isn\u2019t an Apple product, but it\u2019s part of every living room and as such, is part of the modern living room experience. The Hue LED light is designed to be controlled by iDevices and allows you to change the color of the light bulbs to a certain color when it\u2019s raining outside, to turn on before you reach the door, to turn on at a certain time, etc. etc. Microsoft has no answer here.\n\nThermostat \u2013 The Nest isn\u2019t an Apple product per se either, but it\u2019s designed to be used exclusively with iDevices. Like the Hue, you can program your thermostat to come on at certain time of day or let it figure out by itself with it\u2019s motion detector. Microsoft has no answer here.\n\nApple Airport Express Base Station \u2013 the only quality equivalent here is the Logitech Wireless Speaker adapter which allows you to stream music via bluetooth from your Windows Phone, unfortunately you can only stream music through one speaker adapter at a time. Apple\u2019s Express Base Station allows you to stream music to multiple Base Stations in multiple rooms or multiple speakers in the same room simultaneously. You could also use it to print wirelessly as well. Advantage: Apple.\n\nIf you are talking about entertainment using purely a tv, then yes, you could make an argument that Microsoft has an edge there. However, if you are talking about the entire living room experience, including lights, thermostat, and listening to music, then I\u2019d say Apple definitely has the leg up and you\u2019ll find more practical use with your iDevice than your Windows phone or Xbox as an iPhone can be used to control all the devices in your living room where the Xbox, is just well, a box.\n\nThe living room has a lot to fear from Apple at this point. If the iTV or AppleTV does not get updated before Q1 of 2014, expect the AppleTV to be squashed by the other competitors in the market.\n\nThe AppleTV is cheap and lackluster at this point. There is no innovation happening and the developers cannot jump in.\n\nThe big reveal for me was that the XBoxOne is using the same kernel as Windows and Windows Phone. This will allow for easier development and will no doubt allow the device to do a lot, especially considering the Kinect and voice commands that can be developed for it.\n\nMS\u2019s R&D department did a nice job creating the interface and the cool gizmos and the software. They really should have tried to make it smaller though. That will hurt it.\n\nIcedming1987\n\nWohoo and another hit towards making games that tend to take at least two years and many developers. Here comes the in-app purchase and lets make a game in 4 hrs concept. WTF Microsoft, keep console gaming and your stupid all in one media entertainment separate.\n\ndavidgarrickh\n\nI think when you write about \u201ccool new feature\u201d it must be taken with a grain of salt. This is a company who\u2019s CEO balked at the idea of the iPhone only to create a similar in design device. A company who\u2019s founder very recently stated that \u201ciPad users are sad that they don\u2019t have a keyboard or MS Office.\u201d And a company who has 3 EPIC Failures in a row, Win 8, Windows Phone, & The Surface. Since we haven\u2019t actually witnessed ANY of these features, nor did Microsoft have a model for the press to play with; we have to figure that all of these features are just talk. The console world is quickly dying, especially since the introduction of the iPad. If the Xbox One costs more than $300.00, I can\u2019t see it gaining much traction even with current Xbox users due to the lack of backwards compatibility. Even by Microsoft\u2019s claim of \u201csupporting the 360 for years to come\u201d I can\u2019t imagine too many Moms & Dads wanting 2 bulky devices in the living room.\n\nRDProsperity\n\nUnfortunately, I think you missed the boat on both these devices. The XBox One and the Apple TV aren\u2019t competing with each other \u2013 the XBox One is competing with the PS4, and the Apple TV is competing with the Roku Player. And in both cases, they will lose.\n\nThe XBox One has shown that it completely doesn\u2019t understand its brand\u2019s target audience \u2013 gamers. No backwards compatibility and paying a fee for pre-owned games is a slap in the face to that target audience. And all these TV watching features? The XBox brand\u2019s target audience is the one that\u2019s most likely to cut the cord, and therefore, for whom TV watching features are worthless. You say that if I watch Netflix, am plugged into XBox Live, and like Call of Duty, the XBox One is a no-brainer? Not so \u2013 I can still play Call of Duty on my 360 and get my Live features there, and as for Netflix, I\u2019ve got my Roku Player or my Wii for that. Hardly a no-brainer. At least the PS4 kept the gaming audience in mind and gave gamers features that, even if they didn\u2019t explicitly ask for them, they can nod and say, \u201cOkay, sure, I can try that.\u201d\n\nNow, as for the Apple TV, that loses to the Roku Player in a big way, and that is they didn\u2019t open the door to third party developers and third party content providers, which they have no excuse for \u2013 they opened the door for third party developers on the iOS, and they could have easily done it on the Apple TV. But they didn\u2019t, while Roku did. So for half the price, I can get (and have gotten) a Roku Player and can watch not only Hulu Plus, but the Mormon Channel, TED Talks, VEVO, Funimation, and a bunch of other channels you probably haven\u2019t heard of. The Apple TV? Not so much. Now, this is an oversight that Apple can easily correct, but can they correct it enough to win over Roku Player owners? I don\u2019t know. I doubt it.\n\nAbout the author\n\nAlex Heath is a senior writer at Cult of Mac and co-host of the CultCast.
