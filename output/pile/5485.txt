Further customization of the default past that isn't currently possible.\nI've seen one work around that modifies the report template which can potentially make your life easier but this approach has limitations as well.\nLooking through Microsoft connect I don't see this posted yet as a feature request.  It seems to me that this would be an excellent suggestion.\n\n"
