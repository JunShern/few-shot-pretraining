    "text": "1. Field of the Invention\nThe present invention relates to an improved dispensing apparatus. More particularly, a dispenser that incorporates a timing means in conjunction with audio and visual output to assist the user in proper washing techniques for compliance with recommended guidelines and to monitor the number of usages.\n2. Background Art\nEach year, millions of reported illnesses and serious infections are attributable to improper hand washing. The unreported cases are estimated to be much higher. Food borne illness kills over 10,000 people each year, and 70% of the outbreaks originate in food service sector. The passage of viral and bacterial contaminants result from physical contact with an infected source and are carried from one site to another with each successive physical contact.\nThe problem is most evident in hospital and related medical establishments, as well as those businesses associated with preparing and distributing food and food products. A person that handles a single contaminated source will spread the contaminant to every person, article and surface touched by that person. The subsequent contaminated sources represent additional contamination sites that spread the contaminant. The liability of contamination or illness caused by inadequate washing techniques is very high. And, a single food borne illness can tarnish a long-standing reputation and wreak financial havoc.\nProper washing of hands has been demonstrated to kill the contaminants and prevent the spread of disease and contaminants. According to the Centers for Disease Control, proper hand washing is the single most important process in preventing the spread of the pathogens. Microbial contamination refers to microscopic organisms, especially any of the bacteria that cause disease, e.g.: germs. A germ is the rudimentary form in which a new organism is developed, and encompasses any microscopic organism and any one of the bacteria that can cause disease. A bacterium is typically a one-celled microorganism, wherein some cause diseases such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, or anthrax while other bacteria are necessary for fermentation and nitrogen fixation.\nSome industries are much more sensitive to proper washing techniques. Restaurants are particularly prone to the dissemination of food-borne contaminants and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has specific guidelines articulated in the Food Code. The Food Code has several sections that address the washing of hands for food service and related personnel. According to the Food Code regulations, a person must wash after using the bathroom, sneezing, coughing, using a disposable tissue, using tobacco, eating or drinking, handling soiled utensils, and when switching from raw foods to ready-to-eat foods, and any other activity that potentially contaminates the hands.\nIn addition, the Food Code describes a proper hand washing technique as lasting at least 20 seconds, washing up to the forearms, and a special emphasis on between the fingers and underneath fingernails. In addition to timing the washing, it is important to consider the different steps in the washing procedure. A proper washing cycle commences with combining water and soap and scrubbing the hands vigorously. There are various soaps or cleansing liquids that can be used, preferably having anti-bacterial or anti-microbial properties. Nails should be cleaned and scrubbed. After scrubbing, the hands should be thoroughly rinsed with water. The areas between the finger and underneath the fingernails should be specifically cleaned and checked.\nThe regulations also require a supervisor ensure compliance with the regulations and promote the effective washing protocols. Employers may be fined or lose licenses if employees do not observe these regulations, and such employees are likely to lose their employment.\nAlthough there may not be specific codes governing all industries and circumstance, it is common sense that adherence to the regulations will instill a safer environment for all. And, in a litigious environment, adhering to a strict standard is also a cost-effective and practical measure. There are varying international standards for the washing of hands, but in general, the U.S. standard provides a reasonable approach to follow.\nUnfortunately, the proper washing guidelines are not regularly and rigorously followed. Many food service personnel do not appreciate the significance of proper washing. The restaurants rarely provide adequate training to the personnel, and seldom encompass sufficient supervision during the work shifts. In addition, the employees at restaurants and dining establishments tend to be lower paid and may not care or understand the posted written guidelines, especially if the guidelines are in an unfamiliar language. Presently there is no adequate means of providing proper guidance and instruction during washing, no system designed to walk a user through the washing steps, and no simple means of monitoring or tracking employee washing.\nContributing to the problem of inadequate washing is the lack of formal education by those in the food services segment, the low pay scale, and the periods of rushed food preparation. These factors all contribute to a potential for poor washing conditions. Due to the many illnesses caused by food preparation, the FDA continues to apply more formal regulations and guidelines for employers regarding proper washing skills. Employers are demanding a better system of aiding and monitoring employee washing habits.\nThe soap and liquid compounds for hand washing come from a number of different dispensers available in the marketplace. Liquid and semi-liquid dispensers are used in numerous applications and are used to dispense metered portions of cremes, lotions, gels, soaps, anti-bacterial cleansing liquids, anti-microbial cleansing liquids, and similar materials. A typical dispenser allows the user to obtain a specific amount of liquid matter with minimal ease. Manual and semi-automatic dispensing systems are common in the industry, and automated dispensers are beginning to enter the marketplace.\nThe manual dispensers utilize levers and other mechanical assemblies wherein the user must provide some physical contact with the unit in order to dispense the liquid. The physical contact in manipulating the lever does provide a contact with a surface that is typically wet and dirty, and may harbor contaminants. Automated dispensers are becoming more popular, and operate with a variety of electrical and electromechanical components to automatically dispense the liquid after triggering some sensory input. The automatic or xe2x80x98touchlessxe2x80x99 dispensers do not require any physical contact with the dispenser.\nUnfortunately, the touchless dispensers are fairly expensive and require fairly complex electrical and electrical components in order to function. Besides electronic equipment, there are mechanical components such as plungers and gear trains that work in conjunction with the electronics. The mechanical gears draw substantial energy during the xe2x80x98pinch and squeezexe2x80x99 operation to deliver liquid cleanser, requiring frequent battery replacement. In addition, if the batteries are drained, the electrical elements are not functioning properly, or the mechanical functions are broken, the entire unit is disabled and will not dispense any liquid cleansers. The low reliability and the catastrophic failure mode are a major concern in the touchless dispenser market.\nWithin the field of liquid dispensers, there are many types of dispensers. The most common and cost effective is the bag-in-box system, where the liquid comes in a no-leak pouch with pump tip and is disposable. This system is a closed system, and all the air is removed from the pouch during manufacturing. The bag collapses upon itself once the liquid is evacuated, minimizing waste disposal. The closed system has many advantages, including being a more sanitary system. The standard size pouch is 800 ml, but other sizes are in use, including 500 ml to 900 ml. It is a necessary requirement that the cost to produce a disposable pouch be kept to a minimum, while still delivering consistent results. The dispensers are installed in many public facilities, and are subject to extreme wear and tear. Due to the excessive use, the devices must be robust and relatively maintenance free.\nOther dispensers use cartridges or refillable containers. The cartridges must be pierced, are generally not refillable, and produce greater waste. Both cartridges and refillable containers introduce air into the system, aiding the production of bacteria and mold. The cost and administrative complexity in using these other forms of dispensing liquids, as well as the decreased sanitary conditions limit their market appeal. Also, these semi-automatic and automatic systems can be designed to complete the cycle, metering exactly the correct amount of liquid, independently of successive and rapid pushes of the actuating member that frequently occur.\nThe liquid soap industry has numerous brands and categories of cleansing liquids. The viscosity and particulate content are also subject to extreme variations. There is an array of particulate matter that can be added to cleansing liquids to form a grit soap compound that is more effective in cleaning. The most common grit material is plastic microspheres, although other materials such as clay, walnut shells and corn cobs have also been used. Besides the variations of compounds used to form grit soap, the size of the grit also varies.\nThere has also been a consumer demand for anti-microbial cleansing liquids and anti-bacterial cleansing liquids, and the industry has reacted by adding creating new compounds with these properties. These anti-microbial and anti-bacterial cleansing liquids are available with or without grit and have certain characteristics and viscosity differences as compared to standard liquid soap. Besides liquid soap, other compounds dispensed include body and hair shampoo, hand creme solutions, lotions, cleansing liquids, and shaving creme.\nIn a typical bag-in-box operation, a user depresses a lever or controller. This applies pressure to the dispenser tube that creates a vacuum in the collapsible pouch that exerts fluid pressure against the ball in the ball check valve. If the pressure is sufficient, the ball is displaced, and the liquid flows around the ball and into the ball check valve chamber. The liquid flows into the space between the spring and the interior wall of the ball check valve chamber. Once the chamber is sufficiently full, the liquid is forced through the compressed spring and out through the lower fitment hole and through the nozzle.\nThe transition from a user applying purely mechanical forces to meter out some liquid to a semi-automated or automated dispensing unit is appealing to the industry and the public. Soap dispensers tend to become dirty and wet during frequent use, and users are reluctant to touch such units. The wet dispensing units also harbor germs and microbes that could be transferred to the next user, especially is the user does not wash properly. If washed properly, all contaminants should be removed during the subsequent washing.\nThere is growing trend for dispensers that do not require a manual touching due to bacteria and microbial contamination. Touchless dispensers are well known in the prior art and incorporate various means to detect when a user is ready to receive the cleaner from the dispenser. Semi-automatic and automatic systems are designed to complete the cycle, metering exactly the correct amount of liquid, independently of successive and rapid pushes of the actuating member. Additionally, the user no longer has to touch the wet and often dirty dispenser. Unfortunately, many of the touchless dispensers are expensive devices that are prone to electrical and mechanical failures as well as constant battery replacement. Once a touchless dispenser loses power or has some mechanical or electronic failure, the entire unit is inoperable and will not dispense liquid cleanser. And, even using a touchless dispenser and metering the proper amount of liquid cleaning agent does not guarantee that the user will employ proper washing techniques.\nIn order to reduce the aforementioned problems, attempts have been made to produce an improved dispensing system. The prior art systems have general shortcomings and do not adequately address the aforementioned problems. Most generally, the prior art dispenser systems do not provide any instructions or timing for a recommended washing cycle, there is no progress indication, usage numbers are lacking, and there are general reliability problems.\nThe invention of U.S. Pat. No. 5,810,201 (\"\"201) provides some interaction between the dispenser and the user, such as a greeting or music when the user is proximate to the dispenser. This device is not intended to aid in compliance with the recommended washing protocol nor does the \"\"201 invention encompass any timing means for the washing process. There is no number of usages for tracking purposes and no progress indicators for the user to follow during the washing cycle.\nA timed washing dispenser is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,771,925 (\"\"925) that detects the dispenser usage and activates a timing circuit and counts for the recommended washing cycle. There is audio means to signal the start and stop of the washing sequence.\nOne approach to aid in hand washing compliance is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,793,653 (\"\"653). This complex monitoring system embodies several monitoring and data collection points. The \"\"653 system is intended to track employee hand washing usage and allow supervisor collection of data to check compliance. Another compliance-oriented invention is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,945,910 (\"\"910) that shows a monitoring module that operates in conjunction with the dispenser to track employee usage and to provide a means of checking the data for compliance.\nAn all-encompassing system in shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,765,242 (\"\"242), wherein the water lines and a dispenser coordinate the washing and drying cycle. Soapy water is dispensed in the washing phase, rinsing water is dispensed in the rinse cycle, and finally the drying unit is actuated to dry the hands. A timer activated toilet bowl cleaner is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,611,465 that uses an automated timer to release cleaner into the toilet bowl.\nAlthough the prior art discusses a start and stop signal for washing, it does not provide proper washing instructions or reminders to the user as an aid in compliance with recommended washing regulations. There is no progress indication to walk the user through the washing cycle to indicate the different steps of washing, such as lathering, scrubbing and rinsing. Finally, there is no simple tracking means for number of usages so that a supervisor can check the usage number and clear the usage number without generating a complex paper trail. Employees and supervisors are more likely to use and utilize a system that does not place undue hardship or difficulty in operation of the dispenser.\nWhat is needed is a dispenser system that not only meters out the proper amount of liquid soap, but aids the user in complying with proper washing techniques. Such a system notifies the user via audio, visual, or a combination of audio/visual means of the industry acceptable washing intervals. Not only should the device alert the user as to the start and stop of the washing cycle, but it shows the progress of the cycle and provides instructions to the user. Such a device instructs and reminds the user of the steps in washing to aid in promoting compliance with the suggested and recommended guidelines. An overall aspiration is to produce a high reliability dispenser with few moving parts, and wherein a failure will not prevent the liquid cleanser from being dispensed. The design must also be cost effective to manufacture and implement, and allow for easy incorporation into current dispenser designs.\nA further embodiment should make the dispenser more sanitary by employing anti-microbial and anti-bacterial properties into the dispenser plastic housing to reduce the contamination of dispensers requiring a manual or semi-manual engagement. Employing such contamination resistant plastic lowers the potential for spreading pathogens and allows employers to use the less expensive and more rugged mechanical dispenser designs without incurring any increase in the likelihood of spreading contaminants.\nThe present invention has been made in consideration of the aforementioned background. An object of the invention is to provide a dispenser system that aids in compliance with proper hand washing by instructing the user during the washing cycle. The voice instructions operate in conjunction with the recommended timing interval and coach the user on the various steps, three steps in the preferred embodiment, lathering, scrubbing, and rinsing. The multi-part voice instruction messages coach the user in the proper steps of washing and serve as reminders as well as a teaching tool for users.\nA related object is a system of teaching employees the proper method of hand washing. Employees are given orientation or introduction to the dispenser of the present invention and the aural messages and visual feedback teach the user how to wash and the correct duration of washing. A user that follows the simple lesson will learn proper washing protocol, and decrease the likelihood of contamination as well as lowering liability for damages.\nAnother related object of the invention is to employ customizable instruction messages aimed at the specific target audience. Different languages, different speakers, and different wording can be used to optimize the washing for the particular target audience. Voices of characters or celebrities could be used to provide the instructions. Alternatively, voice instructions can be customized by the supervisor to include instructions specific to the bathroom facility or intended user.\nYet another object of the invention is to employ visual feedback during the washing. The voice instructions at each step are coordinated with visual signals that show the user the progress through the washing cycle. Such progress walks the user through the process and has a psychological incentive to complete the entire washing cycle. Multiple LED\"\"s can be arranged to track the progress by using different colors such as green, yellow and red as the user progresses through the washing cycle. A line of LED\"\"s could illuminate one at a time in procession every few seconds such as a countup. Alternatively, all the LED\"\"s could be illuminated at the initiation of the sequence, and count off one by one until the countdown is completed. The feedback characteristic incorporates a continuous indication of time elapsed or remaining time to show the user the progression and allows the user to better manage the time. An LCD display can show a clock that counts up or down for the washing cycle.\nA related feedback object of the invention is to employ electronics and include a microprocessor to provide customizable feedback, such as modulation of sound or visual signals to the user. The customizable feedback can include increasing frequency of beeps, raising the tone, blinking the displays differently through the cycle, or a count down time display. The feedback indicates where the user is in the cycle and encourages him/her to complete the cycle during the washing period and alert user when the time interval is completed.\nAn object of the invention is to provide a means of tracking the number of usages of the dispenser over a given time period. As a management tool, a supervisor needs to be able to approximately track whether the employees are washing their hands. The supervisor can obtain a simple approximation by tabulating the number of employees during a given shift and the length of time of the shift. Although the supervisor will not be able to identify which employees washed, he will be able to ascertain gross violations of protocol and respond accordingly.\nA related object includes where the compliance can be monitored by the supervisor by accessing the microcontroller of the present invention and getting the number of usages. The access may be voice actuated, keypad, badge code, magnetic key or any other accessing means. In a preferred embodiment the supervisor uses a magnetic key to obtain dispenser count information as well as to reset the dispensers or customize the operation. The information can be displayed on an LCD or otherwise communicated, but in the preferred embodiment the number of usages is communicated verbally by the dispenser system. The magnetic key in conjunction with the Hall sensor yield a non-invasive method of quickly retrieving the number of usages. The dispenser does not need to be opened to read a counter and the number is not otherwise displayed on the dispenser. Rather, the supervisor swipes the magnet key and is quickly told the count number,\nAnd another object is an LCD display provides text or images to assist in the washing process. The instructions could be displayed in conjunction with the audio instructions for the hearing impaired and comply with the various disability acts and requirements. Images could be shown depicting the various stages such as lathering, scrubbing as a means of communicating the information in a manner that is understandable by persons, even if the instruction language is unknown to the user.\nAnother object is to use verbal instructions for the washing sequence interspersed with music or silence rather than a complete verbal instructional message. The instructional message is broken into three steps in the preferred embodiment-lathering, scrubbing, and rinsing. An additional step of inspecting can be included in the instructions. Each step lasts a certain time interval and in a preferred embodiment, the lathering step takes approximately 8 seconds, the scrubbing step takes 7 seconds, and the rinsing step takes 5 secondsxe2x80x94for a total of 20 seconds.\nAn additional object is to provide for different time intervals and steps depending upon the industry or application. Certain sectors, such as nursing homes or health clinics, may require a longer washing cycle with additional steps for sterilization. The microcontroller can be pre-programmed in the factory with the appropriate messages or the user can configure the dispenser by customizing the time and/or messages.\nAnother object of the invention is to employ further electronics to play music or advertisements during the washing period. Such audio output can be interspersed around the voice instructions. Another object is to incorporate modulating patterns to indicate the timing position within the washing interval. The modulating patterns consist of tones that beep in an increasing frequency and can incorporate a visual flashing pattern in conjunction with the audible tones. In versions with a speech synthesizer, a numeric countdown or countup can instruct the user in the washing cycle.\nAdditional instructions are within the scope of the invention, and may include instructions on drying hands or inspecting hands. Additionally, the audio output may include advertisements or promotions to the user. As a captive audience, the audio output in the dispenser is an effective marketing tool. Such advertisement may promote a particular event or product.\nA related object is to provide for randomization of each washing cycle step to prevent the messages from being mundane. Not only are the messages customizable, but the frequency or repetition can be set to occur at different pushbar requests. For example, the LED\"\"s can continue to be employed, but the voice instructions can be played every fifth time, or every fifth time on average. A further implementation is to have the average duty cycle of voice messages get smaller with realtime, number of usages, or number of supervisor resets, and revert to a new average value. For example, the average duty cycle of voice messages will decrease to every third time and continue to become less frequent over time, number or usages or resets. If the supervisor notes a decrease in usage numbers, the dispenser can be reset to again play voice instructions every actuation.\nFurther objects include a dispenser, whereby the system provides audio guidance to proper washing intervals for the visually impaired. The instructions can aid those with visual difficulty in properly washing and provide other information specific to the facility.\nYet a further object is incorporating a means of actuating the sequence. In a preferred embodiment, a Hall effect sensor is triggered each time the pushbar containing a magnet is actuated to dispense liquid cleansers. The sensor can trigger the start of the washing process, and also serve to track the number of usages of the individual actuations of the lever bar. Hall effect sensors are well known in the art and are triggered by introducing a magnetic field in close proximity to the sensor.\nAnd yet one further object is to monitor the amount of liquid cleanser in the dispenser by keeping track of the usages number. By knowing the amount of liquid in the dispenser and the amount metered out on each application, a simple processor calculation can approximate the amount of liquid and the remaining number of usages. An appropriate message can be communicated to ensure the dispenser is always adequately filled.\nAn object of the invention is to provide an actuation means such as a mechanical plunger, magnetic sensor, or spring assembly to actuate the timing mechanism. A preferred embodiment uses a magnet and a Hall effect sensor. Other electronic means include optical, ultrasound, or thermal sensing. The optical means encompasses a typical beam-breaking technology, while the ultrasound relies upon the reflected waves to trigger the event.\nThe simple electronic components are powered by a small battery, preferably lithium, for longer lasting duration. A further power source is gel pack batteries, wherein the smaller profile and longer lasting life would be a beneficial factor. Once again, the dispenser of the present embodiment does not require a power source to operate, and functions without any power applied to the unit. The power source is used for communicating the washing instructions, providing visual progress feedback, and recording and reporting number of usages.\nAn object of the invention is a tracking function for the number of usages in order for a supervisor to make an assessment of whether the employees are complying with the recommended guidelines. The number of usages also allows the supervisor to assess the dispenser as a teaching tool for assisting users in washing. The number of usages information is known only to the supervisor who resets the counter until the next inspection. The usage number is communicated by the dispenser aural output.\nThere are also means of using identification by the employee. The identification means includes entering an employee number or code number or PIN number. Alternatively, the employees could be issued RFID badges or name labels. This would serve as a tracking or monitoring mechanism for employers either voluntarily in order to reduce liability, or because of FDA regulations. Another embodiment encompasses a voice recognition means to detect an input voice cue. The users would have to have the voice input into the system, but once recorded, the identification of each user is possible. Technology has lowered the cost for such products while increasing reliability, ease of use and therefore compliance, and decreasing size and weight. The voice commands can be programmed to accept only certain commands and also to recognize an individual user\"\"s voice, thus automating the tracking process and eliminate the need for entering of a PIN or code number. Such an implementation should be easy to operate by the users. A further detection means for outputting a count and re-setting the counter is a magnetic means using the Hall effect sensors.\nAnother object includes using optical, infrared, magnetic, or ultrasonic sensing in a touchless or semi-automatic operation and actuation rather than a mechanical means to allow the convenience of touchless operation. Electronic switching means includes capacitive switching. An object of the invention is an optical and/or mechanical activation where the soap dispensing operation is driven by a motor or solenoid. The motor or solenoid can be either rotary or linear and automatically provide the sufficient force to meter out a liquid portion. In a preferred embodiment, a force of less than five pounds is required to dispense the liquid. Such force complies with the American Disabilities Act requirements. Current gear/cam devices provide this force with minimal consumption of power.\nAnd yet an additional object is the design of the present invention as a throw away module or a field replaceable module depending on the manufacturing costs and the operating usage/environment. The package is most conveniently locatable in the dispenser housing and can snap into position on the lid for easy access.\nAn object of the invention is the manufacture and construction of dispensers that incorporate anti-microbial, anti-fungal and anti-bacterial plastics in the design. Although anti-microbial, anti-fungal and anti-bacterial plastics have been deployed in some applications, it has not been introduced into the dispenser industry. The generic name for the agent added to the ABS plastic is OBPA (Oxybisphenoxarsine). The use of anti-microbial/fungal/bacterial thermoplastics resists the growth of germs such as E-Coli, and reduces the transfer of such diseases. The wet environment of dispensers combined with the frequent use by many persons create a breeding ground for various forms of unwanted germs. The use of anti-microbial/fungal/bacterial plastics, such as poly-alpha BN and poly-alpha BN-K, provide a necessary step in preventing the spread of germs. Although the entire unit can be manufactured using this plastic, the most important component is the pushbar.\nAnd yet another object of the invention is a dispenser for metering a liquid cleanser to a user and prompting the user in compliance with a recommended washing technique, comprising a container suitable for housing the liquid soap, a power source, a microcontroller connected to the power source, an actuation means, wherein the actuation means is triggered by the user and dispenses the liquid cleanser. Furthermore, the actuation means initiates a washing cycle containing a plurality of washing steps. There is a timer or timing means to count for the washing cycle, and a means of outputting a plurality of aural messages for instructing the user during each of the plurality of washing steps.\nAnother object is a dispenser wherein the actuation means is a Hall effect sensor attached to the dispenser and a magnet attached to a pushbar, wherein the sensor is actuated when the pushbar is operated.\nYet a further object is a dispenser wherein there are a plurality of washing step aural messages for each of the washing steps, and the washing step aural messages are randomly selected for outputting as the plurality of aural messages. Additionally, the plurality of aural messages can be in different languages.\nAn additional object is a dispenser further comprising a means of determining realtime clock data.\nAnd, a further object is a dispenser further comprising a means of calculating a refill date and communicating the refill date.\nAn object includes a dispenser wherein the plurality of washing steps are lathering, scrubbing, and rinsing.\nIn addition, an object is a dispenser wherein the dispenser is manufactured using an Oxybisphenoxarsine (OBPA) agent. Also, a dispenser further comprising a pushbar containing an Oxybisphenoxarsine (OBPA) agent.\nAn object of the invention is a dispenser for metering a liquid cleanser to a user and prompting the user in compliance with a recommended washing technique, comprising an actuation means, wherein the actuation means is triggered by the user and dispenses the liquid cleanser, and wherein the actuation means initiates a washing cycle containing a plurality of washing steps. There is a timer to count for the washing cycle, and a visual means of indicating progress during the washing cycle. Also included is a means of outputting a plurality of aural messages for instructing the user during each of the plurality of washing steps, as well as a means of tracking a number of usages.\nA further object includes a dispenser wherein the visual means is a plurality of light emitting diodes.\nAdditionally, an object is a dispenser further comprising a means of sensing a usage number request, wherein the number of usages is output as a verbal numeral.\nIn addition, an object is a dispenser further comprising a means of identifying the user by voice recognition. Also, an object is dispenser further comprising a means of identifying a supervisor by voice recognition.\nFurthermore, an object is a dispenser further comprising a means of customizing the plurality of aural messages for instructing the user during each of the plurality of washing steps.\nAn object of the invention is a dispenser for metering a liquid cleanser to a user and prompting the user in compliance with a recommended washing technique, comprising a power source, and an actuation means, wherein the actuation means is triggered by the user and dispenses the liquid cleanser, and wherein the actuation means initiates a washing cycle containing a plurality of washing steps. Additionally, there is a means of outputting aural messages, and a visual display means for indicating progress of the recommended washing technique. Finally, there is a processing means for tracking a usage number, and timing of each of the aural messages and the visual display means, wherein the processing means is connected to the power source and the actuation means.\nA related object includes a dispenser wherein the power source is a gel pack.\nAnother related object is a dispenser wherein the processing means is a microcontroller.\nAnd, an object includes a dispenser further comprising a means of customizing the timing of each of the aural messages and the visual display means.\nAn object also includes a method for teaching proper hand washing using a dispenser, wherein the dispenser contains a processing means, wherein the processing means initiates a timed washing cycle containing a plurality of timed washing steps. The method comprising the steps of actuating a mechanism of dispensing a liquid cleanser from a user input, wherein the actuating commences the timed washing cycle. Outputting an instructional message during a first of the plurality of timed washing steps, and displaying a first progress indication. Outputting an instructional message during a second of the plurality of timed washing steps, and displaying a second progress indication. Outputting an instructional message during a third of the plurality of timed washing steps, and displaying a third progress indication. Finally, ending the timed washing cycle.\nFinally, a last object is a system for teaching a user the proper method of hand washing, comprising the steps of starting a washing cycle containing a plurality of washing steps once an actuation means to dispense liquid cleanser has been manipulated, outputting a first aural instruction during a first washing step, illuminating a first visual display during a first washing step, outputting a second aural instruction during a second washing step, illuminating a second visual display during a second washing step, outputting a third aural instruction during a third washing step and illuminating a third visual display during a third washing step.\nOther objects, features and advantages are apparent from description in conjunction with the accompanying drawings."
