    "text": "A few years ago, the History Channel was best known to some as a punch line on HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Sopranos.\u201d Remember mobster Tony Soprano sitting alone late at night in his New Jersey McMansion eating ice cream and watching World War II documentaries about Adolph Hitler and Winston Churchill?\n\nThese days, no one is laughing at the History Channel \u2014 not with audiences like the 13.1 million viewers who tuned in last Sunday for the first two hours of \u201cThe Bible,\u201d a 10-hour miniseries that runs through Easter Sunday.\n\nStrong demographics, too. Opening night of \u201cThe Bible\u201d drew 5 million viewers in the coveted 18-to-49-year-old group. No broadcast network came close on either count. The only competition was from the zombies on AMC\u2019s \u201cWalking Dead.\u201d And while they drew more young viewers, they had fewer overall. \u201cThe Bible\u201d is the most-watched entertainment program of the year on cable TV.\n\nNor was it a one-shot phenomenon for the History Channel. In May, \u201cHatfields & McCoys,\u201d a miniseries about the feuding families starring Kevin Costner, opened with 13.9 million viewers on the History Channel. Its young audience was about a million less than \u201cThe Bible\u201d but still larger than any network television competition on its opening night.\n\nThe History Channel is doing what ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox and the vast majority of cable channels can\u2019t: It\u2019s finding new viewers and scoring huge audiences in prime time. And it is doing that with programming ignored or dismissed by many mainstream critics.\n\nDirk Hoogstra, the executive vice president of development and programming for History, says the channel\u2019s winning formula involves a mix of old research and new media. It couples almost two decades of continuing, on-air audience feedback to the kind of documentaries Tony Soprano was shown watching with hard-driving online and social media campaigns aimed at spreading the message about new shows. That last point takes the conversation into politics \u2014 with talk of media elites, fly-over America, culture wars and \u201cinfluencers.\u201d And that\u2019s where the success story of the History Channel really gets interesting.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been going since \u201995 and doing these docs [historical documentaries], so we know topics and subject areas that have shown evidence of interest from our viewers,\u201d Hoogstra says when asked how the channel chooses projects such as \u201cThe Bible\u201d or \u201cThe Vikings,\u201d another scripted drama series that drew 6.2 million viewers Sunday night in the time period after the religious saga.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done documentaries on the Vikings, for example, that have popped unusually high numbers,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve done previous series where the subtopic of an episode was on the Vikings, and that one outperformed the other episodes that were about other barbarian hordes. And we use all of that to inform these big epic drama projects.\u201d\n\nIn other words, just as Netflix uses research from its 20 million subscribers to determine which stars viewers would like to see in what kinds of stories before committing to a production like the Baltimore-made \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d so is History Channel using almost two decades of audience feedback on its documentaries in deciding what kind of big-ticket miniseries to make.\n\nSmart. But that\u2019s only about subject matter. What\u2019s really impressive is the way the Hearst- and Disney-owned channel gets the word out on a series like \u201cThe Bible\u201d using social media, conservative online outlets and media-savvy church leaders. While Hoogstra talks at length about social media, he largely sidesteps the political part of the story.\n\n\u201cBecause there\u2019s so much original content now on television, from cable and now places like Netflix and DirecTV, you\u2019ve got to find ways to cut through and get people to notice you,\u201d Hoogstra says. \u201cAnd one of the ways to do that is to get people who have big social followings on Twitter.\u201d\n\nUsing the term \u201cinfluencers\u201d to describe them, the History executive says, \u201cThere are some people out there that have an enormous amount of influence over huge groups of people. If they tweet, \u2018Watch \u201cViking\u201d on Sunday,\u2019 they\u2019re likely to take that advice.\u201d\n\nOne of those \u201cinfluencers\u201d on \u201cThe Bible\u201d is Rick Warren, pastor of the Saddleback Church in Southern California, who has led study groups and webcasts on the series at his megachurch.\n\nOn March 3, @RickWarren tweeted to his 908,000 followers:\u201d Watch the World Premier of #TheBible, tonight on History Channel 8/7pm. An epic 10 part series! Tell everyone. Please RT\u201d\n\nOn March 4, Warren sent another tweet linking to a picture of him with husband and wife Mark Burnett and Roma Downey, the executive producers of the series. It shows him holding a gift from the couple. The cutline says: \u201cMark and Roma gave me a 1706 Bible for our 3yr partnership in #TheBible movie.\u201d\n\nWarren sent multiple tweets urging followers to retweet and watch before the premiere. He\u2019s also quoted in the Huffington Post saying, \u201cI have seen probably every film made on the Bible in the last 50 years. This is by far the best one.\u201d\n\nWarren is also an adviser on \u201cThe Bible,\u201d in case anyone cares about whether that would influence his rave review. But then, so are pastors from virtually every megachurch from Florida to California \u2014 and they are raving as well. Burnett, the reality TV producer responsible for series like \u201cSurvivor,\u201d and Downey, the star of \u201cTouched by an Angel,\u201d brought the History Channel a lot of new-media, pulpit-powered influencers as promotional partners.\n\nThe History Channel also got a big push from conservative websites such as Breitbart.com and Glenn Beck\u2019s TheBlaze.\n\n\u201cFrom singer Christina Aguilera to \u2018Glee\u2019 star Jane Lynch, Hollywood Twitter accounts are abuzz with messages about \u2018The Bible,\u2019 a project that was created and produced by famed reality show producer Mark Burnett and his wife, actress Roma Downey (see the duo discuss the project on TheBlaze TV last week),\u201d one of several articles at theblaze.com began last week.\n\n\u201cAs I understand it, there was an active campaign to cultivate conservative religious leaders,\u201d says Richard Vatz, Towson University professor of communications. \u201cAnd why not? \u2026 I always wondered why so many entrepreneurs write off such a large audience.\u201d\n\nThe conversation about the series is steeped in culture-war politics.\n\nA reviewer at the conservative online magazine \u201cAmerican Thinker\u201d writes, \u201cI've read a few of the reviews of the History Channel's first episode of The Bible series that debuted Sunday night. They are not good. My web host, AOL, doesn't even talk about it, although that's not unexpected. AOL/Huffpost are Left secular. Well I watched it last night and I thought it was terrific.\u201d\n\nMy critique of the first two hours: It\u2019s grittier-looking than most Bible stories on film, and the special effects aren\u2019t bad. But the leading figures feel like stick figures to me. Part of it is the wooden acting involved in the depiction of characters like the Egyptian pharaoh who didn\u2019t want to let Moses and his people go.\n\nI don\u2019t know if that makes me \u201cLeft secular,\u201d mainly because I\u2019m not sure what \u201cLeft secular\u201d means.\n\nRobert J. Thompson, Syracuse University professor of popular culture, says there is an important cultural story involved in the ratings success of the History Channel, but it goes beyond right- and left-wing politics. What intrigues Thompson is the way the channel\u2019s programmers like Hoogstra have taken something once considered elite culture, a niche TV channel for people who love history, and made it into a mainstream viewing choice for millions of \u201cregular people\u201d in prime time.\n\n\u201cFor the History Channel to position itself through the packaging, marketing and creation of programming like the \u2018Hatfields & McCoys\u2019 or \u2018The Bible\u2019 as the antithesis of elitism is an incredibly clever thing,\u201d Thompson says.\n\n\u201cThat they could take something like \u2018The History Channel: where history comes alive,\u2019 with this big bronze \u2018H\u2019 for a logo, and have it be the thing that regular people embrace really is kind of remarkable,\u201d he adds. \u201cI think a lot of big fans of the History Channel, somewhere humming in the back of their minds is the thought, \u2018If only all those egghead teachers I used to have could have would made history this interesting.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe ancient warrior genre that includes \"Game of Thrones,\" \"Merlin\" and \"Spartacus: War of the Damned\" will get a little more crowded this winter/spring TV season: Make some room for the \"Vikings.\" History premieres its first scripted series at 9 p.m. CT March 3. It tells the story of the 8th...\n\nIn a culture where we whip ourselves into instant media frenzies and then move on forgetting only days later what it was that so upset us, maybe Trevor Noah\u2019s tweets won\u2019t be such a big deal by the weekend.\n\nA day after Trevor Noah was declared the new host of \"The Daily Show,\" his graphic tweets targeting women and Jews are causing a social media backlash and Comedy Central is defending its newest late-night star."
