Find the key in first column, if found add to the column you are currently handling. If not found add a new row at the end.\nTo save changes I would again write a class that takes care of a single file and save all keys that have a value.\nI see there are ' and \" used. If that is essential save the type. In that case I would not use String for the value, but create a simple class with the value and String sign.\nHINT: This would be much easier using a tree for editing the entries.\nIn that case you don't have to translate the noded design of the original file and visa versa:\nSample: http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/23746/TreeView-with-Columns but there are many out there.\n\n"
