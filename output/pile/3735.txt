    "text": "Q:\n\nAlgorithm for N-way merge\n\nA 2-way merge is widely studied as a part of Mergesort algorithm.\nBut I am interested to find out the best way one can perform an N-way merge?\nLets say, I have N files which have sorted 1 million integers each.\nI have to merge them into 1 single file which will have those 100 million sorted integers.\nPlease keep in mind that use case for this problem is actually external sorting which is disk based. Therefore, in real scenarios there would be memory limitation as well. So a naive approach of merging 2 files at a time (99 times) won't work. Lets say we have only a small sliding window of memory available for each array.\nI am not sure if there is already a standardized solution to this N-way merge. (Googling didn't tell me much).\nBut if you know if a good n-way merge algorithm, please post algo/link.\nTime complexity: If we greatly increase the number of files (N) to be merged, how would that affect the time complexity of your algorithm?\nThanks for your answers.\nI haven't been asked this anywhere, but I felt this could be an interesting interview question. Therefore tagged.\n\nA:\n\nHow about the following idea:\n\nCreate a priority queue\nIterate through each file f\n\nenqueue the pair (nextNumberIn(f), f) using the first value as priority key\n\nWhile queue not empty\n\ndequeue head (m, f) of queue\noutput m\nif f not depleted\n\nenqueue (nextNumberIn(f), f)\n\nSince adding elements to a priority queue can be done in logarithmic time, item 2 is O(N \u00d7 log N). Since (almost all) iterations of the while loop adds an element, the whole while-loop is O(M \u00d7 log N) where M is the total number of numbers to sort.\nAssuming all files have a non-empty sequence of numbers, we have M > N and thus the whole algorithm should be O(M \u00d7 log N).\n\nA:\n\nSearch for \"Polyphase merge\", check out classics - Donald Knuth & E.H.Friend.\nAlso, you may want to take a look at the proposed Smart Block Merging by Seyedafsari & Hasanzadeh, that, similarly to earlier suggestions, uses priority queues.\nAnother interesting reasonsing is In Place Merging Algorithm by Kim & Kutzner.\nI also recommend this paper by Vitter: External memory algorithms and data structures: dealing with massive data.\n\nA:\n\nOne simple idea is to keep a priority queue of the ranges to merge, stored in such a way that the range with the smallest first element is removed first from the queue.  You can then do an N-way merge as follows:\n\nInsert all of the ranges into the priority queue, excluding empty ranges.\nWhile the priority queue is not empty:\n\nDequeue the smallest element from the queue.\nAppend the first element of this range to the output sequence.\nIf it's nonempty, insert the rest of the sequence back into the priority queue.\n\nThe correctness of this algorithm is essentially a generalization of the proof that a 2-way merge works correctly - if you always add the smallest element from any range, and all the ranges are sorted, you end up with the sequence as a whole sorted.\nThe runtime complexity of this algorithm can be found as follows.  Let M be the total number of elements in all the sequences.  If we use a binary heap, then we do at most O(M) insertions and O(M) deletions from the priority queue, since for each element written to the output sequence there's a dequeue to pull out the smallest sequence, followed by an enqueue to put the rest of the sequence back into the queue.  Each of these steps takes O(lg N) operations, because insertion or deletion from a binary heap with N elements in it takes O(lg N) time.  This gives a net runtime of O(M lg N), which grows less than linearly with the number of input sequences.\nThere may be a way to get this even faster, but this seems like a pretty good solution.  The memory usage is O(N) because we need O(N) overhead for the binary heap.  If we implement the binary heap by storing pointers to the sequences rather than the sequences themselves, this shouldn't be too much of a problem unless you have a truly ridiculous number of sequences to merge.  In that case, just merge them in groups that do fit into memory, then merge all the results.\nHope this helps!\n\n"
