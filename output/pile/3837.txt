The winner of this year\u2019s prize was Home Lab by Robert Winston.\n\nThe video competition tasked groups involved in judging shortlisted books with making a short video about the experience. The videos were judged on creativity, enthusiasm and production by the Royal Society and chairman of the shortlist judges, Professor Christl Donnelly, from Imperial College London.\n\nThe videos had to feature each of the books, the children\u2019s opinions and some shots of the children judging the books but the rest was up to them."
