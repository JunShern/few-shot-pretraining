    "text": "Want to know how far electric cars have come in the last decade? Just ask the Mini Electric. Both of them. The first arrived in 2008, a test bed rather than a production car, Mini built 500 and leased them to human guinea pigs in the US \u2013 the beginning of a data and opinion harvest that would inform the launch of the BMW i family five years later and every electrified BMW since.\n\nFast-forward 11 years and you might expect performance and range to have grown handsomely, but I\u2019m staring at the spec sheet for the new 2019 Mini Electric, and you\u2019d be wrong: 204bhp (2008) plays 181bhp (2019); the range was 150 miles then, 144 miles now; 0\u201362mph in 8.5secs in the old one, 7.5secs today.\n\nWhat has changed is price and practicality \u2013 the batteries on the old one were, er, chunky. Chunky enough to swallow the entire boot and back seats. The new Mini Electric, with its 32kWh T-shaped lithium-ion battery slipped under the floor is still 160kg heavier than a Cooper S, but you get the same (read: still cramped) boot and rear seat space, and with prices starting at \u00a324,400 (or \u00a3299pcm) after the \u00a33,500 government grant, it costs \u00a3500 less than an equivalently specced Cooper S, too. This is significant.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason why there\u2019s an armada of small, affordable, everyday electric cars \u2013 the majority with \u2018e\u2019 grafted onto their badges \u2013 coming our way in the next six months. Stuff like the VW ID.3, Peugeot e-208, Corsa-e and Honda e \u2013 y\u2019know, the ones we might actually be able to afford. We\u2019ve reached a tipping point, where battery size and cost has reduced to the point where cars like this, with a little help from Her Majesty\u2019s Government, can be priced in line with petrol or diesel equivalents. And because most people with an interest in EVs have been ogling I-Paces, Teslas and e-trons, without the wedge to actually buy one, there\u2019s pent-up demand.\n\nIt\u2019s taken a while, then, but Mini has made the sums add up\u2026 but only by positioning this car carefully. Firstly, you\u2019ll only be able to buy it as a 3dr \u2013 Mini\u2019s best-selling body style. Fair enough. There will be only one power and performance level \u2013 0\u201380 per cent top-up in 35mins from a 50kW DC charger, 181bhp, 199lb ft, FWD, totally insignificant 93mph top speed, which puts it in the Cooper S bracket for performance. That explains the bootlid\u2019s Cooper S badge (despite it not actually featuring anywhere in the car\u2019s name) and the fake air-scooped Cooper S bonnet.\n\nThen we come to the WLTP range of 144 miles, only a handful more than the Honda e. In the real world it\u2019ll be less than that, of course, because most of us won\u2019t have the bottle to ever dip below 20 per cent charge. It\u2019s the same thinking as the Honda \u2013 fit a smaller battery and spend the money on stuff that matters, like interior quality and equipment \u2013 but when you can have a recently updated Renault Zoe with a 242-mile range for less, or an electric 208 or Corsa with over 200 miles for a couple of grand more, the range feels a little mean.\n\nMini has resisted the temptation to over-tinker with the design. Want a spaceship? There\u2019s already the BMW i3 for that. Your opportunity to make a statement is the optional 17-inch, asymmetrical Corona wheels, lifted straight from the concept (anyone else seeing a three-pin plug?). Smaller changes include a new largely blanked-off front grille, protruding by an extra 17mm and striped in Energetic Yellow, although you can switch back to body colour if you suffer from sensitive retinas.\n\nThe front and rear bumpers are a unique, slippery design to eke out a few extra miles \u2013 no splitters or Sport packs here \u2013 and you get LED lights front and back as standard. Get your ruler out and you\u2019ll note the car rides 15mm higher than standard \u2013 a necessary evil to fit those batteries in \u2013 although extended wheelarches disguise the damage.\n\nInside, it\u2019s the first Mini with a new floating digital instrument screen behind the wheel \u2013 something that\u2019ll be rolled out on all its models when their replacements arrive. A consumption dial, to let you know how leaden your right foot is, sits on the left, battery charge is on the right, and the whole thing is wrapped in an anti-glare coating that, while necessary on a sunny day, is a bit like looking at your vitals through a frosted bathroom window.\n\nA mildly different centre console features an electronic handbrake \u2013 a first for the 3dr \u2013 while the dashboard houses toggle switches for adjusting the level of brake regen, flipping between Sport, Mid and Green driving modes and turning the traction control off.\n\nMini is open about this being very much a chassis designed for a combustion engine, modified to make batteries and motors fit\u2026 fortunately that made its goal of making it drive as close to a Cooper S as possible infinitely simpler. There are tweaks to the suspension to account for the extra height and weight, and a new ARB system that\u2019s supposedly three times faster than traditional DSC to eliminate wheelspin when you stomp on it at the lights, but the fundamentals are shared.\n\nFrankly, I\u2019m amazed I\u2019ve managed to find quite so many words to talk about a car that\u2019s familiar in every regard, besides a powertrain transplant. Hell, Mini\u2019s even found a way to build it on the same production line in Oxford as the petrol and diesel versions \u2013 marrying the batteries, motor and power electronics in the exact same way the engine and transmission meets the chassis. So let\u2019s embrace our sense of wonder for everyday electric cars while we still can; another decade, and they\u2019ll be the norm."
