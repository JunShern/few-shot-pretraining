    "text": "Work/Life Balance\n\nSpaghetti on a plate. That\u2019s what many of our calendars \u2013 electronic or paper \u2013 look like. All of our appointments and lists of to-dos mixed together in one place. This accomplishes one of our goals: to get everything written down in one place. However, it doesn\u2019t accomplish our primary goal: to get everything done in a timely fashion with minimum stress.\n\nAnother (food-related) way to look at this issue is to answer these questions:\n\nThis is the fun, interactive example I use during my Focus Pocus: 24 Tricks for Regaining Command of Your Day seminar to get people thinking about how they can be more efficient and productive. The point is that getting everything into one place is the first step in efficient productivity. The second step is having a sorting system for all those things so your brain doesn\u2019t have to constantly sort things before selecting which to do next.\n\nTwo things happened today that prompted this article. The first occurred during a keynote speech I was delivering at the Society of Financial Examiners annual educational conference.\n\nThe room was filled with four hundred executives who had gathered to hear some modern-day time management suggestions. I was talking about how important it is to get some down time during the day to refresh and refocus. In a moment of clarity, I blurted out, \u201cAnd whatever happened to recess?\u201d The question drew a rousing cheer and loud applause! I thought to myself, \u201cYeah, whatever did happen to recess?\u201d\n\nAn hour later, I was reviewing my e-mail on the way to the airport. There was a fairly lengthy thread started by my business partner in my other business \u2013 Outdoorplay. He was congratulating our Customer Service Manager on closing a large phone order.\n\nThe conversation really took off though when our General Manager announced that tomorrow\u2019s lunch would be pizza compliments of the company. Everyone was congratulating Stacey, thanking Brian, and debating what type of pizzas should be ordered. You can\u2019t mandate the kind of collegiality a simple pizza party can produce.\n\nMuch is made of starting; it is the hardest thing. We lament its prospect. We\u2019ve named the behavior of non-starting \u2013 procrastination \u2013 which many consider a condition or a failing or a personality type.\n\nIn \u201cDo the Work,\u201d Steven Pressfield\u2019s insightful analysis of this difficulty with starting, he names the force we experience Resistance. Resistance, says Pressfield, is the ever-present enemy within us all that must be battled daily so that results can be produced.\n\nMany have addressed starting and its accomplice, proscrastination. Here are a few:\n\nTechniques and suggestions for beating procrastination and getting started can be found in those works.\n\nFast Forward to the End\n\nBut what of starting\u2019s silent partner \u2013 finishing? Getting our work to closure is often a struggle too. If fact, behind starting, finishing up is the second hardest thing to accomplish. Whether it\u2019s the actual work or its remnants, failure to lay tasks and projects to their final rest can create just as many problems as failure to start can.\n\n\u201cGerbils on a wheel.\u201d I use this expression frequently when talking with audiences about how we feel after busting hump all day and feeling like nothing got done. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice to feel like the wheel actually moved forward once in a while?\n\nBreaking Free from the Frame\n\nLike most wheels, the wheel we each run on during the day is held in place on either side of its hub by forks. Imagine looking down on a bicycle wheel to where the forks attach to the hub. The wheel spins at the hub and the forks keep the wheel in place. That\u2019s good on a bicycle because everything works together so that the spinning wheels assist in making the bike move forward.\n\nThe gerbil\u2019s wheel is similarly secured but its forks are fixed to the bottom of the cage. Thus, no amount of spinning will move the wheel forward. The wheel must break free from the forks for it to roll forward.\n\nAnyone who\u2019s spent more than ten minutes with me knows that fly fishing is one of my life-long passions. It\u2019s a product of my Montana upbringing. Long before Robert Redford brought Norman Maclean\u2019s beautiful novella A River Runs Through It to the big screen, I was standing in the dirt lane in front of my childhood home trying to master the art of fly casting.\n\nFinesse Versus Force\n\nWhat makes fly casting unique is that it\u2019s the line that\u2019s being cast, not the nearly weightless artificial fly tied to the end of it. You see, the fly follows the line and the objective is to cast the line out so that the fly comes to rest on the water delicately.\n\nBrute force has no place in this endeavor. It\u2019s about rhythm and finesse. The harder we try to drive the fly out to where the fish are, the less chance it will happen. However, if we settle into the rhythm of the cast and work with the forces of nature, the more successful we are.\n\nThe April issue of Spirit, Southwest Airline\u2019s in-flight magazine, shows a group of kids playing outside on its cover. That makes sense with spring right around the corner. Surprisingly, though, the associated article inside discusses why adults should play more. The article\u2019s opening example is illustrative:\n\nUnbox a toy for a toddler and as often as not, the child will play with the box instead of the toy!\n\nWhy? Because the box is more fun! It can be anything \u2013 a hat, a fort, a cup, a ship. On the other hand, modern toys are typically activity specific, which allows for little imaginative input by its recipient.\n\nLessons Learned\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean toys are bad. It means boxes are good! Specifically, Jay Heinrich, author of the \u201cIt\u2019s Called Play\u201d article noted above, cites the following lessons we can learn from playing with the box;\n\nFancy toys, programmed activities, and \u201cenrichment\u201d don\u2019t hold a candle to a kid\u2019s own improvising.\n\nUnsupervised activity of the kind that terrifies modern, safety-obsessed parents can be good for developing brains and bodies.\n\nOutdoor trumps indoors, fitness-wise.\n\nAdults can benefit from the same sort of pointless, stupid activity [as playing with a box].\n\nThe modern work environment is a symphony of interruption and distraction. But it\u2019s not the real productivity saboteur. The true villain resides inside our head. It\u2019s that little voice constantly reminding us of all that needs doing \u2013 the \u201cOh, ya!\u201d and the \u201cCan\u2019t forget that.\u201d and the \u201cThat too; gotta get that done!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a fact. The noisiest place on earth is between our ears. Yet it\u2019s the place that must be quietest for us to focus because focus drives productivity. The more focused we get, the better work we do and the more of it we get done.\n\nThe problem is that the outside world is constantly demanding our attention. Consequently, it seems impossible \u2013 even counter-productive \u2013 to pursue quieting strategies. In essence we\u2019ve become dependent (addicted?) to the frenzy, the activity, the urgency of the frenetic world.\n\nTelling people I work in the time management field produces the same result as telling people I was once a lawyer. They make a polite remark about my choice of endeavors and move on to another, more interesting subject. The only difference is that no one has ever felt compelled to tell me their favorite time management joke.\n\nThere\u2019s a blessing in that last bit.\n\nSeriously, though, I know speaking on time management doesn\u2019t sound exciting. It pales in comparison to things like, \u201cI do product design for Apple.\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m in marketing at Nike.\u201d I get that, but unfortunately I possess a driving need to find better, faster ways of getting things done. In the bio I provide those tasked with introducing me at speaking engagements it says that at age thirteen I found the quickest way to vacuum the family store so I could spend more time fly fishing. It\u2019s true. I\u2019m afflicted. I\u2019m okay with that. Let me tell you why.\n\nWhat is Time?\n\nIn conversations about QuietSpacing\u00ae \u2013 my time management methodology \u2013 and the related programs I conduct, I often explain to people that the overarching principle of all my work is this:\n\nTime is a limited, non-renewal source with an undisclosed expiration date for each of us.\n\nAuthenticity \u2013 Doing What You Do Best \u2013 Is The Essence Of Productivity\n\n\u201cGo stand in line!\u201d That\u2019s what the diminutive overwrought 20-something hostess at Coop\u2019s Place said to the semi-inebriated patron pestering her to seat his party in the amazingly authentic low-country tavern we were dining at in the French Quarter of New Orleans last week. (Pic at right).\n\nNow, before you go all customer-service on me, understand that this guest had walked past the growing line on the sidewalk outside the door with two (count them: two) very clear signs on those doors with large black arrows pointing down the sidewalk and with the following printed on them \u2013 Stand at the end of the line. If there\u2019s no line, stand here until you\u2019re seated. The message was very clear. If you want to eat here, stand in line.\n\nOver the last eight months, I\u2019ve been wrestling with a combination of Bright-Shiny-Objectisis and existential/professional angst. The root of the problem was a sense of restlessness. The restlessness arose from twelve years of involvement in Outdoorplay and seven years of QuietSpacing\u00ae efforts. Done enough times, all things lose their luster. Such was the case with these two endeavors.\n\nI kept getting distracted by new and exciting topics \u2013 simplicity, lifestyle choices, Tenkara fly fishing. Instead of focusing on my core business of developing solid content to help my clients solve their time management struggles, I was drafting tables of contents for new books and making lists of authors to read and people to follow."
