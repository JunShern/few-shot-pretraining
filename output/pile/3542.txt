    "text": "NCAA Picks Contest, Day 6: Wilmer can seal the deal with Syracuse tonight\n\nThis contest is all but over and it\u2019s my fault. I\u2019m having a Billy Gillispie kind of postseason.\n\n(By the way, there\u2019s loud chatter that this job is Billy Donovan\u2019s if he wants it, and he may want it. Why would Billy Donovan want the Kentucky job now, after turning it down two years ago? Or will Billy flirt with Kentucky like he did with the Orlando Magic and still turn it down\u2013or take it and then turn it down a few days later?\n\nTim Kawakami\n\nPost navigation\n\nI just want you to explain how you thought you could win this comp without picking arizona.\n\nYou need 27 points with 5 days left to play\u2026\n\nHard to make that up with 1 seeds, No?\n\nC-A-T-S\n\nThis UK fan wouldn\u2019t mind seeing Calipari jump across the state line, but I know a lot of my fellow Cats fans who are nervous about the idea because he left UMass under a cloud of NCAA sanctions, and after the mess in the late 80s they don\u2019t want any coach who might drag the program back into scandal again. All I know is, the guy is a hell of a recruiter, he wins everywhere he goes (except in the NBA), and there hasn\u2019t been any hint of illicit activity at Memphis since he\u2019s been there. I\u2019d much rather UK hired him than Travis Ford, who seems to be the choice of the good ol\u2019 boys (probably because he\u2019s a good ol\u2019 boy himself), but doesn\u2019t have nearly the resume or experience that I want to see in a Kentucky head coach (he\u2019s won a grand total of one NCAA tournament game, for crying out loud!). If Cal\u2019s not interested, then my next phone calls go to Dixon, Izzo, Rick Barnes, Bruce Pearl, and Jay Wright, approximately in that order. Maybe Tim Floyd if I think I can keep him there for more than 3 years. Those guys all have proven track records and the kind of outgoing, charismatic personality you need (and that Gillespie lacked) to deal with being the most famous person in the state. Personally I\u2019m not interested in another tabloid romance with Donovan even if he were available, and anyway he seems to have lost some of his old recruiting mojo ever since his aborted departure for the NBA.\n\nOne thing I do know that this time around I don\u2019t want to see UK panic and make a quick hire just because the sports talk world is pressuring them to make up their minds. I\u2019d rather they took the time to thoroughly vet every candidate and make sure he\u2019s the right fit for this job. It took them two months to settle on Pitino back in \u201989, and he was worth every day of it.\n\nKevin\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure your colleague\u2019s name is Wilner, not \u201cWilmer\u201d.\n\nhttp://merc heykawk\n\nget it right will you. you are embarassing yourself, my mistake you are incapable of getting it right."
