BAKER, Associate Justice\n\n       On June 16, 2005, a Pulaski County jury convicted appellant, Robert Leander\n\nStiggers, of first-degree murder and first-degree battery. He was sentenced to forty years\n\nimprisonment for the murder conviction and twenty years imprisonment for the battery\n\nconviction with the sentences to run consecutively. Stiggers\u2019s convictions and sentences\n\nwere affirmed in Stiggers v. State, CACR 05-1399 (Ark. App. May 31, 2006) (unpublished).\n\n       Stiggers\u2019s convictions and sentences stem from a January 10, 2003 shooting that\n\noccurred in the Hollingsworth Courts neighborhood in Little Rock. Raynaud Muldrew and\n\nWardell Newsome were both shot. Muldrew was found in a vehicle, and Newsome was\n\nlying near it. Muldrew died as a result of his injuries. Despite being shot in the back of the\n\nhead, Newsome survived his injuries. Immediately after the shooting and at trial, Newsome\n\nidentified Stiggers as the shooter. The relevant facts, as recounted by the court of appeals in\n\nStiggers\u2019s direct appeal are as follows:\n\f                                    Cite as 2014 Ark. 184\n\n       Sergeant Sidney Allen . . . discovered Wardell Newsome lying on the ground near the\n       vehicle. He had been shot four times in the right shoulder and once behind his right\n       ear. While at the scene, Newsome told Sgt. Allen that [Stiggers] was the person who\n       shot him.\n\n               . . . Detectives Eric Knowles and Keith Cockrell questioned Newsome about\n       the incident while he was undergoing treatment at UAMS. Newsome explained that\n       he had borrowed a friend\u2019s car earlier in the evening and picked up Muldrew. He told\n       the detectives that Muldrew had purchased marijuana and then the two of them went\n       to a liquor store to purchase cigarettes and a couple of Swisher cigars. While there,\n       they saw [Stiggers] who asked for a ride to Hollingsworth Courts. [Stiggers] was\n       riding directly behind Newsome in the back seat of the car, and during the ride,\n       [Stiggers] apparently became aggressive and started yelling. Newsome stated that, at\n       one point, he turned around and noticed that [Stiggers] was holding a small handgun.\n       While following [Stiggers\u2019s] directions into the Hollingsworth Courts neighborhood,\n       Newsome testified that [Stiggers] told them to \u201csay goodnight\u201d and \u201csay your\n       prayers\u201d because he was going to kill them. Newsome indicated that he did not think\n       [Stiggers] was serious because they had known each other and been friends for years.\n\n               Newsome explained that, as he pulled into an alley in the residential complex\n       at [Stiggers]\u2019s request, [Stiggers] shot him behind the right ear. He pointed out that\n       he lost consciousness immediately, and when he regained consciousness, he noticed\n       Muldrew slumped over in the front passenger seat. Newsome explained that he then\n       crawled out of the vehicle to look for help, and a neighbor called the police.\n       Newsome recognized [Stiggers]\u2019s picture in a group of photos presented by Detectives\n       Knowles and Cockrell, and he again identified him as the shooter.\n\nStiggers, CACR 05-1399, slip op. at 1.\n\n       After the court of appeals issued its mandate, on August 20, 2006, Stiggers filed his\n\ninitial Rule 37.1 petition in Pulaski County Circuit Court. After several continuances due\n\nto issues related to Stiggers\u2019s representation, on July 2, 2012, Stiggers filed an amended\n\npetition and the circuit court held a hearing that same day. On November 16, 2012, the\n\ncircuit court denied Stiggers\u2019s petition. Stiggers now brings this appeal and presents one issue\n\nfor review: the circuit court erred by denying Stiggers\u2019s Rule 37.1 petition because Stiggers\n\nreceived unconstitutional ineffective assistance of counsel when his counsel failed to interview\n\n                                               2\n\f                                    Cite as 2014 Ark. 184\n\nand call certain witnesses.\n\n       \u201cOn appeal from a circuit court\u2019s ruling on a petitioner\u2019s request for Rule 37 relief, this\n\ncourt will not reverse the circuit court\u2019s decision granting or denying post-conviction relief\n\nunless it is clearly erroneous. E.g., Prater v. State, 2012 Ark. 164, at 8, 402 S.W.3d 68, 74. A\n\nfinding is clearly erroneous when, although there is evidence to support it, the appellate court\n\nafter reviewing the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake\n\nhas been committed. Id., 402 S.W.3d at 74.\u201d Mason v. State, 2013 Ark. 492, at 1\u20132, ___\n\nS.W.3d ___, ___.\n\n       Our standard of review requires that we assess the effectiveness of counsel under the\n\ntwo-prong standard set forth by the Supreme Court of the United States in Strickland v.\n\nWashington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984). Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are reviewed\n\nunder the following standard:\n\n       A convicted defendant\u2019s claim that counsel\u2019s assistance was so defective as to require\n       reversal of a conviction has two components. First, the defendant must show that\n       counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. This requires showing that counsel made errors\n       so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u201ccounsel\u201d guaranteed the defendant\n       by the Sixth Amendment. Second, the defendant must show that the deficient\n       performance prejudiced the defense. This requires showing that counsel\u2019s errors were\n       so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable.\n       Unless a defendant makes both showings, it cannot be said that the conviction resulted\n       from a breakdown in the adversary process that renders the result unreliable.\n\nBurton v. State, 367 Ark. 109, 111, 238 S.W.3d 111, 113 (2006) (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S.\nat 687).\n\n       The reviewing court must indulge in a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls\n\nwithin the wide range of reasonable professional assistance. Id. The petitioner claiming\n\nineffective assistance of counsel has the burden of overcoming that presumption by identifying\n\n                                                3\n\f                                    Cite as 2014 Ark. 184\n\nthe acts and omissions of counsel which, when viewed from counsel\u2019s perspective at the time\n\nof trial, could not have been the result of reasonable professional judgment. See id. Therefore,\n\nStiggers must first show that counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of\n\nreasonableness and then that counsel\u2019s errors actually had an adverse effect on the defense. Id.\n\nStiggers must satisfy both prongs of the test, and it is not necessary to determine whether\n\ncounsel was deficient if Stiggers fails to demonstrate prejudice as to an alleged error. Abernathy\n\nv. State, 2012 Ark. 59, 386 S.W.3d 477 (per curiam).\n\n       Further, with respect to an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim regarding the decision\n\nof trial counsel to call a witness, such matters are generally trial strategy and outside the\n\npurview of Rule 37.1. Banks v. State, 2013 Ark. 147. Where a petitioner alleges ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel concerning the failure to call witnesses, it is incumbent on the petitioner\n\nto name the witness, provide a summary of the testimony, and establish that the testimony\n\nwould have been admissible into evidence. Moten v. State, 2013 Ark. 503 (per curiam);\n\nStevenson v. State, 2013 Ark. 302 (per curiam) (citing Hogan v. State, 2013 Ark. 223 (per\n\ncuriam)). In order to demonstrate prejudice, the petitioner is required to establish that there\n\nwas a reasonable probability that, had counsel performed further investigation and presented\n\nthe witness, the outcome of the trial would have been different. See Carter v. State, 2010 Ark.\n\n231, 364 S.W.3d 46 (per curiam). Trial counsel must use his or her best judgment to\n\ndetermine which witnesses will be beneficial to the client. Id. Nonetheless, such strategic\n\ndecisions must still be supported by reasonable professional judgment. Id. Finally, \u201c[w]hen\n\nassessing an attorney\u2019s decision not to call a particular witness, it must be taken into account\n\n\n                                               4\n\f                                     Cite as 2014 Ark. 184\n\nthat the decision is largely a matter of professional judgment which experienced advocates\n\ncould endlessly debate, and the fact that there was a witness or witnesses that could have\n\noffered testimony beneficial to the defense is not in itself proof of counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness. Huls\n\nv. State, [301 Ark. 572, 785 S.W.2d 467 (1990)]; Dumond v. State, 294 Ark. 379, 743 S.W.2d\n\n779 (1988).\u201d Johnson v. State, 325 Ark. 44, 49, 924 S.W.2d 233, 236 (1996).\n\n       We now turn to the sole issue raised by Stiggers. Stiggers\u2019s allegation of ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel is that his trial counsel failed to interview four potential witnesses in\n\npreparation for Stiggers\u2019s defense or call them as a witness at trial: Eddie Pride, Temika\n\nDonley, Kristopher Johnson, and Damika Mitchell. Stiggers contends that these witnesses\n\nwould have supported his argument that another person, a person named \u201cJason,\u201d1 was the\n\nshooter. He further asserts that the witnesses\u2019 testimony was admissible under hearsay\n\nexceptions but that his trial counsel did not interview or call the witnesses at trial to determine\n\nwhat exceptions applied. Stiggers asserts that the witnesses\u2019s testimony would have impeached\n\nthe State\u2019s witness. Finally, Stiggers asserts that he was prejudiced by his defense counsel\u2019s\n\nfailure to call these witnesses.\n\n       Stiggers\u2019s theory at trial was as follows: while he was purchasing drugs from the two\n\nvictims, two unnamed men came up to the vehicle and shot the victims. Stiggers testified at\n\ntrial that the two men approached the vehicle and let Stiggers run away prior to the shooting,\n\nand that as he was running away he heard the gunshots. In sum, Stiggers\u2019s theory of the case\n\nwas that someone else was the shooter.\n\n\n       1\n        The record does not reflect Jason\u2019s last name.\n                                                 5\n\f                                    Cite as 2014 Ark. 184\n\n       Prior to trial, on April 8, 2005, the circuit court conducted a pretrial hearing. The State\n\nmade a Zinger motion to prohibit Stiggers from eliciting testimony from witnesses regarding\n\n\u201cJason\u201d because the testimony was inadmissible hearsay.2 The circuit court granted the\n\nmotion. Stiggers acquiesced to the circuit court\u2019s ruling and agreed that the \u201cJason\u201d testimony\n\nwas hearsay, but explained that there could be a chain of events in the testimony where\n\nStiggers could elicit such testimony. Stiggers complied with the circuit court\u2019s ruling but\n\nreserved the right to approach the bench if such circumstances arose. At trial, defense counsel\n\ndid not call Pride, Mitchell, Donley, or Johnson as witnesses.\n\n       In his petition, Stiggers asserted that counsel was ineffective for not interviewing or\n\ncalling the four witnesses, three of which he alleges would have provided \u201cJason\u201d testimony.\n\n\n       2\n        A Zinger motion refers to Zinger v. State, 313 Ark. 70, 75\u201376, 852 S.W.2d 320, 323\n(1993), where we held that the standard for admissibility of evidence tending to incriminate\nother persons in the crime being charged is as follows:\n\n       A defendant may introduce evidence tending to show that someone other than the\n       defendant committed the crime charged, but such evidence is inadmissible unless it\n       points directly to the guilt of the third party. Evidence which does no more than create\n       an inference or conjecture as to another\u2019s guilt is inadmissible.\n\n       [T]he rule does not require that any evidence, however remote, must be admitted to\n       show a third party\u2019s possible culpability . . . . [E]vidence of mere motive or\n       opportunity to commit the crime in another person, without more, will not suffice to\n       raise a reasonable doubt about a defendant\u2019s guilt: there must be direct or\n       circumstantial evidence linking the third person to the actual perpetration of the crime.\n\nId. (quoting State v. Wilson, 367 S.E.2d 589 (N.C. 1988) and People v. Kaurish, 802 P.2d 278\n(Cal. 1990)).\n\n\n\n\n                                               6\n\f                                     Cite as 2014 Ark. 184\n\nAt the postconviction hearing, Stiggers introduced statements from two of the \u201cJason\u201d\n\nwitnesses: Donley and Johnson. The third \u201cJason\u201d witness, Pride, also provided a statement;\n\nhowever, the circuit court did not accept Pride\u2019s statement because Pride was not known at\n\ntrial, there was no statement in the case file, and Pride had not testified at a previous hearing.\n\nStiggers did not introduce a statement from Mitchell. At the Rule 37 hearing, defense counsel\n\ntestified that he did not recall interviewing the four witnesses and did not call them as\n\nwitnesses.\n\n        Stiggers first asserts that Eddie Pride would have testified that Newsome told Pride that\n\nStiggers was not the shooter but that it was \u201cJason.\u201d Second, Stiggers asserts that Donley,\n\nMuldrew\u2019s girlfriend, would have testified that Muldrew told her that \u201cJason\u201d had threatened\n\nto kill Muldrew, Muldrew\u2019s child, and the child\u2019s mother. Third, Stiggers asserts that Johnson\n\nwould have testified that \u201cJason\u201d had threatened to kill Muldrew. He contends that Johnson\n\nwould have testified that he overheard Muldrew on the phone with \u201cJason\u201d four or five days\n\nbefore the shooting, and heard \u201cJason\u201d discussing a \u201cbad drug deal\u201d or \u201ctheft of drugs\u201d\n\ninvolving \u201cJason\u2019s\u201d drugs, and threatening to kill Muldrew and others. Fourth, Stiggers\n\ncontends that Mitchell would have testified that she saw both victims prior to the shooting and\n\nthat the vehicle\u2019s lights were off, which was contrary to the State\u2019s witness\u2019s testimony.\n\n       First, with regard to Pride, although Stiggers testified that he informed his counsel about\n\nPride, defense counsel testified that prior to trial he had likely heard Pride\u2019s name, but did not\n\nrecall knowledge of Pride\u2019s allegations that Newsome had told Pride that Stiggers was not the\n\nshooter. Defense counsel further testified that,\n\n\n                                                7\n\f                                    Cite as 2014 Ark. 184\n\n       that certainly would have been something . . . very important. . . . I don\u2019t recall that\n       ever being told to me. If I had been given that information, that would certainly would\n       have been the diligent thing to do, to look for Mr. Pride. I would say if I had recognized\n       that there was possibly a prior statement out there saying that someone else had done it\n       coming from a living witness, I would have absolutely asked him about it.\n\n       With regard to Donley and Johnson, defense counsel testified that after reviewing\n\nDonley and Johnson\u2019s police statements in the file, he considered both witnesses\u2019s testimony to\n\nbe in the group of people he categorized as Zinger witnesses and concluded that their testimony\n\nwould have been inadmissible hearsay. Defense counsel said \u201cMy analysis was that it didn\u2019t\n\ncome in because of Zinger and there were hearsay issues obviously, but beyond that, even\n\nbeyond the hearsay, the Zinger issue kept it out.\u201d\n\n       Finally, with regard to Mitchell\u2019s testimony, defense counsel testified that although he\n\ncould \u201csee there was some argument\u201d that Mitchell\u2019s testimony regarding the lights in the car\n\nbeing off at the time of the shooting would have helped Stiggers, he did not recall interviewing\n\nMitchell or making a strategic decision to not interview her. Defense counsel testified that he\n\ncross-examined every witness that came near the vehicle regarding the facets of the vehicle,\n\nincluding the surviving witness, Newsome. Defense counsel further testified that there \u201cwas\n\na huge amount of discrepancies\u201d in the testimony from witnesses regarding whether the lights\n\nwere on or off and that he cross-examined every witness.\n\n       Here, Stiggers fails to substantiate his claim that counsel was ineffective based on the\n\nfailure to interview or call the \u201cJason\u201d witnesses. Stiggers has failed to meet his burden under\n\nthe first prong of Strickland because he has not demonstrated that his counsel\u2019s performance fell\n\nbelow an objective standard of reasonableness. Additionally, Stiggers has failed to demonstrate\n\n\n                                               8\n\f                                     Cite as 2014 Ark. 184\n\nthat the \u201cJason\u201d testimony would have been admissible hearsay and makes conclusory\n\nallegations that it may have fit under an exception to hearsay. Further, the record supports that\n\ndefense counsel\u2019s decision to not interview or call the witnesses was based on reasonable\n\nprofessional judgment. The testimony was inadmissible pursuant to Zinger, as it did no more\n\nthan create an inference or conjecture as to \u201cJason\u2019s\u201d involvement, the testimony was hearsay,\n\nand Stiggers failed to demonstrate that it was admissible. Nor has Stiggers met the second prong\n\nunder Strickland because he has failed to demonstrate that he was prejudiced by defense counsel\u2019s\n\nfailure to interview the witnesses. Stiggers must do more than allege prejudice; he must\n\ndemonstrate it with facts. Walton v. State, 2013 Ark. 254 (per curiam). Here, Stiggers provides\n\nno evidence that he suffered any prejudice as a result of counsel\u2019s failure to call the \u201cJason\u201d\n\nwitnesses. We find no merit in Stiggers\u2019s claim regarding Pride, Donley, or Johnson.\n\n       Finally, with regard to Mitchell\u2019s testimony, as discussed above, our law requires that\n\nStiggers name the witness, provide a summary of the testimony, and establish that the testimony\n\nwould have been admissible into evidence. Moten v. State, supra. The objective in reviewing\n\nan assertion of ineffective assistance of counsel concerning the failure to call certain witnesses\n\nis to determine whether this failure resulted in actual prejudice that denied the petitioner a fair\n\ntrial. Woody v. State, 2009 Ark. 413 (per curiam). In order to demonstrate prejudice, Stiggers\n\nmust establish that there was a reasonable probability that, had counsel performed further\n\ninvestigation and presented the witness, the outcome of the trial would have been different. Id.\n\n       While Stiggers claims that Mitchell\u2019s testimony regarding the vehicle would have\n\ndiscredited Newsome\u2019s testimony, defense counsel testified that he cross-examined every\n\n\n                                                9\n\f                                    Cite as 2014 Ark. 184\n\nwitness that came into contact with the vehicle. Based on the record, we are not persuaded that\n\nhad defense counsel interviewed and called Mitchell as a witness regarding the lights of the car,\n\nthe outcome of the trial would have been different.\n\n       Stiggers simply did not provide any support for his conclusory claims that counsel was\n\nineffective and made no showing that counsel committed any specific error that prejudiced the\n\ndefense. See Johnson v. State, 325 Ark. 44, 49, 924 S.W.2d 233, 236 (1996) (\u201c[T]he fact that\n\nthere was a witness or witnesses that could have offered testimony beneficial to the defense is\n\nnot in itself proof of counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness.\u201d). In reviewing the record before us, we\n\nconclude that Stiggers has not met his burden.\n\n       Based on the discussion above, we do not find that the circuit court erred.\n\n       Affirmed.\n\n       Ronald L.
