First Shift makes mention of nano-technology or poison, but I don't recall if that was ever confirmed or not.\n\nDoes the series reveal what is the villain in the air?\n\nA:\n\nThe nanos wipe out humans in a controlled, timed, DNA-based attack. The bombs served three purposes (and there were only three bombs): They ushered the survivors into the silos; they provided the initial (and fuzzy) legends about the destruction of all things; and they were the trauma that allowed the subsequent regimen of medication to divide the forgotten past from their new future.\n\n"
