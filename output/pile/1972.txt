Especially in \u0130stanbul\u2019s Muslim quarters, no adequate relationship could be established between spiritual life under the roof of privacy and the worldly life of the street. Indeed it was this sense of distance that bestowed the street on the city\u2019s dogs as their home.\n\nThe fate of street dogs, which were the guardians of public property, began to change with the increasing will of getting closer to the \u201ccivilized\u201d world. The Ottoman intellectual, who had seen the West, was not at all pleased with the appearance of \u0130stanbul, which fell far short of satisfying those crazes; the streets were narrow and disorderly, the houses little more than ruins, the transportation system did not work, and infrastructure was inadequate. When the dogs, which one never encountered in European cities, were added to this picture, it became a far cry indeed from the modern world. While the four-legged municipality of the Ottomans was being transformed into the two-legged municipality of the Republic, the positivist concept of life was also expunging dogs from \u0130stanbul\u2019s history.\n\nThrough photographs, travel journals, postcards, magazines, engravings, and other media dated from the 19th to the early 20th centuries, the exhibition, curated by Ekrem I\u015f\u0131n and counselled by Catherine Pinguet, follows the history of these fellow \u0130stanbulites that played an integral part in the city\u2019s social life during their coexistence with humans through the centuries.\n\ngallery wall paint sponsor\n\n"
