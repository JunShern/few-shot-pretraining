Gary Roell, who suffered from chronic mental\nillness, caused a disturbance at his neighbor\u2019s condominium while experiencing a condition\nknown as excited delirium. Hamilton County sheriff\u2019s deputies arrived to find Roell half-naked,\nmuttering unintelligibly, and standing next to a broken window holding a hose and the remnants\nof a hanging plant. While attempting to subdue Roell, the deputies physically struggled with him\nand unsuccessfully tased him multiple times. Roell stopped breathing during the encounter with\nthe deputies and was pronounced dead shortly thereafter. His death was documented by the\ncoroner as natural, resulting from his excited delirium.\n\n       Roell\u2019s wife, Nancy Roell, appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in\nfavor of the individual deputies on her claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. She also appeals the grant\nof summary judgment in favor of Hamilton County on her claims under both \u00a7 1983 and the\nAmericans with Disabilities Act (the ADA). For the following reasons, we AFFIRM the\njudgment of the district court.\n\n                                        I. BACKGROUND\n\nA.     Factual background\n\n       Roell suffered from mental illness, including schizoaffective disorder and paranoid\ndelusions, for many years. Although Roell\u2019s symptoms could be successfully controlled by\nmedication, he had a history of noncompliance with his drug regimen. When he did not take his\nmedication, Roell\u2019s mental health deteriorated and his unpredictable behavior rendered him a\ndanger to both himself and to others.\n\n       Roell stopped taking his medication in June 2013 and began exhibiting signs of mental\ndecompensation by early August. Sometime in the late evening hours of August 12 or the early\nmorning hours of August 13, Roell entered a state of excited delirium. Nancy Roell was out of\ntown during this time, participating in a church mission in New Jersey. In the midst of his\n\f No. 16-4045               Roell v. Hamilton Cty Bd. of Comm\u2019rs, et al.                   Page 3\n\n\nexcited delirium, Roell damaged his and Nancy\u2019s condominium by scattering debris, clothes, and\nother household items inside and around the building. Roell then went to the condominium of\nhis neighbor, Rachana Agarwal, and threw a flower pot through her window.\n\n       Agarwal was awakened by the noise of shattering glass and went downstairs to find Roell\nstanding outside of her condominium by the broken window. She attempted to talk to Roell,\nwho was screaming something about \u201cwater.\u201d Roell then pulled the screen from Agarwal\u2019s\nwindow and threw it at her. At that point, Agarwal became scared and ran back inside the\ncondominium, where she told her son, Soham, to call 911. Soham dialed 911 and handed the\nphone to Agarwal, who told the operator that her neighbor was \u201cacting crazy.\u201d Agarwal testified\nthat, during this time, Roell appeared to be angry, his face red and his eyes bulging, and he kept\nmuttering unintelligible things about water. Roell was also pacing back and forth in front of\nAgarwal\u2019s broken window, periodically peering into her condominium.\n\n       Deputies Matthew Alexander, Willy Dalid, and Joseph Huddleston responded to the\ndispatch of a \u201cneighbor trouble\u201d call. First to arrive at Agarwal\u2019s condominium were Deputies\nAlexander and Huddleston, who were told by Agarwal that Roell was \u201cin the back breaking\nthings.\u201d They entered the gated patio area and saw Roell standing by Agarwal\u2019s broken window\nholding a garden hose with a metal nozzle in one hand and a garden basket in the other. The\ngarden basket was a hanging plant surrounded by peat moss and held together with plastic wire.\nRoell was wearing a t-shirt but was otherwise naked. According to Deputy Alexander, Roell was\nscreaming \u201cno\u201d and something about water when he and Deputy Huddleston arrived.\n\n       Deputy Huddleston proceeded to ask Roell what he was doing.             Although Deputy\nHuddleston could not recall Roell\u2019s response, he testified that Roell immediately turned and\napproached him and Deputy Alexander in an aggressive manner. Roell still had the hose and the\ngarden basket in his hands. Deputy Alexander similarly recalled that he and Deputy Huddleston\ntold Roell to \u201cshow us your hands\u201d and that Roell, \u201cimmediately, within seconds,\u201d charged at\nthem at a \u201cpretty brisk walk.\u201d Deputy Alexander also said that Roell approached them still\nholding the hose and the garden basket.\n\f No. 16-4045                Roell v. Hamilton Cty Bd. of Comm\u2019rs, et al.                 Page 4\n\n\n       Soham Agarwal was watching the events unfold from inside the condominium and heard\nRoell screaming about how \u201che didn\u2019t have water and we had water.\u201d In addition, Soham\nobserved the deputies telling Roell to calm down, to stop resisting, to come over to them, and to\ndrop whatever he had in his hands. Soham recalled that Roell repeatedly shouted that he did not\nhave a weapon. But Soham also testified that, despite Roell\u2019s assertions that he was unarmed,\nRoell was facing the deputies swinging the hose \u201cas if he was trying to hit somebody.\u201d Rachana\nAgarwal, also watching from the inside of her condominium, confirmed that the deputies told\nRoell to calm down and that Roell was swinging the hose nozzle at the deputies. Agarwal\nobserved the deputies and Roell approach each other, with Roell proceeding at a pace between a\nwalk and a sprint, still holding the hose.\n\n       As Roell approached the deputies, Deputy Huddleston told Roell to stop and to get on the\nground or he would be tased. Deputy Huddleston then unholstered his X2 Taser and arced it as a\nwarning. Arcing a taser does not deploy the device; it simply creates a sound. Roell flinched\nwhen Deputy Huddleston arced his taser but kept approaching. Deputy Huddleston once more\narced his taser and commanded Roell to get on the ground. Roell again flinched but continued to\napproach the deputies. Deputy Huddleston then holstered his taser and reached out to grab one\nof Roell\u2019s arms. At the same time, Deputy Alexander grabbed Roell\u2019s other arm.\n\n       Roell swung the garden basket at Deputy Huddleston as they met. Deputy Huddleston,\nDeputy Alexander, and Roell all fell to the ground outside of the gated patio area during their\nstruggle. Roell was wet and slippery, either from sweat or water, and managed to break free\nfrom the deputies\u2019 grasp. As Roell tried to enter back through the patio gate, Deputy Huddleston\ntased him. Deputy Huddleston testified that taser appeared to have some effect because Roell\nbuckled over a little bit. Roell nonetheless continued into the patio and closed the gate. The\ndeputies followed him through the gate while Deputy Huddleston\u2019s taser was still on its five-\nsecond deployment cycle. By that time, Deputy Dalid had arrived at the scene. All three\ndeputies tried to restrain Roell\u2019s arms, but were unsuccessful because he was combative and\nthrashing around on the ground. Deputy Alexander testified that he was punched in the face by\nRoell at some point during the struggle.\n\f No. 16-4045               Roell v. Hamilton Cty Bd. of Comm\u2019rs, et al.                    Page 5\n\n\n       While Deputies Alexander and Dalid attempted to hold Roell\u2019s arms, Deputy Huddleston\ntried to deploy his taser in drive-stun mode to the back of Roell\u2019s leg. This court has previously\nexplained the use of a taser in drive-stun mode as follows:\n\n       In drive-stun mode, \u2018the operator removes the dart cartridge and pushes two\n       electrode contacts located on the front of the taser directly against the victim. In\n       this mode, the taser delivers an electric shock . . . [,] but does not cause an\n       override of the victim\u2019s central nervous system as it does in dart-mode.\u2019\n\nCockrell v. City of Cincinnati, 468 F. App\u2019x 491, 492 (6th Cir. 2012) (quoting Mattos v.\nAgarano, 661 F.3d 433, 443 (9th Cir. 2011) (en banc)). In deploying his taser in drive-stun\nmode, Deputy Huddleston hoped to complete the cycle necessary to achieve Roell\u2019s\nneuromuscular incapacitation, believing that one of the barbs from his previous attempt to tase\nRoell had not connected. The taser failed to incapacitate Roell, however, and he continued to\nstruggle with the deputies on the ground. Deputy Huddleston again holstered his taser and tried\nto control Roell\u2019s legs, while Deputies Alexander and Dalid attempted to control Roell\u2019s arms.\n\n       Roell managed to escape the grasp of all three deputies and stood up in a face-to-face\nposition with Deputy Alexander, whose back was against a tree. Deputy Huddleston once more\ntased Roell using the device\u2019s dart-mode, this time deploying two barbs into his back. Although\nthe taser still did not take effect, the deputies were able to get Roell on the ground and handcuff\nhim. Because of Roell\u2019s continued resistance, the deputies had to restrain Roell\u2019s hands in front\nof his body by using two sets of handcuffs.\n\n       Roell appeared \u201csomewhat under control\u201d once he was handcuffed, but he continued to\nthrash his legs and kicked Deputy Huddleston in the groin. Deputy Huddleston then sent Deputy\nAlexander to get leg shackles from the one of the patrol cars so that Roell\u2019s feet could also be\nrestrained. Once the deputies shackled Roell\u2019s legs, they positioned him on his left side. Deputy\nDalid was trying to control Roell\u2019s upper body by holding on to his right shoulder. Both Deputy\nHuddleston and Deputy Dalid testified that, once restrained, Roell went limp and began to snore.\nRoell would wake up, thrash around, and then go limp and lapse back into snoring. Deputy\nDalid observed Roell doing this twice before he noticed that Roell had no pulse and had stopped\nbreathing. By that time, Corporal (now Sergeant) Mikal Steers arrived on the scene and began\nadministering CPR to Roell until the life squad arrived. Although Corporal Steers detected a\n\f No. 16-4045                Roell v. Hamilton Cty Bd. of Comm\u2019rs, et al.                    Page 6\n\n\nfaint pulse on several occasions, he was unable to revive Roell.           The emergency medical\ntechnicians were also unable to revive Roell, and he was pronounced dead at the hospital\nemergency room.\n\n       Dr. Jennifer Schott, the deputy coroner, determined that the cause of Roell\u2019s death was\n\u201cexcited delirium due to schizoaffective disorder\u201d and that the manner of his death was natural.\nIncluded with the Death Record was a report drafted by Dr. Schott, stating that Roell had a\nhistory of \u201cphysical altercation with police officers\u201d and that the \u201cuse of a conducted energy\ndevice against decedent\u201d had occurred.         Also noted were Roell\u2019s various abrasions and\ncontusions, injuries from the taser barbs, and four broken ribs. The report, however, did not find\nthat any of these injuries contributed to Roell\u2019s death. In her affidavit, Dr. Schott stated that she\nperformed a microscopic examination of Roell\u2019s barb wounds and found no evidence that the\nconducted energy device used on Roell caused any electrical burns. Nor did Dr. Schott find any\nevidence that Roell had been asphyxiated, which is consistent with the absence of any evidence\nthat the deputies applied compressive force in attempting to restrain Roell.\n\nB.     Procedural background\n\n       In August 2014, Nancy Roell, as the executrix of Roell\u2019s estate, filed suit in the United\nStates District Court for the Southern District of Ohio against both Hamilton County and the\nHamilton County Board of County Commissioners (collectively, Hamilton County), as well as\nagainst Sheriff Jim Neil and Deputies Alexander, Dalid, and Huddleston. She first asserted\nclaims pursuant to 42 U.S.C \u00a7 1983, alleging that (1) Deputies Alexander, Dalid, and Huddleston\nviolated Roell\u2019s Fourth Amendment right to be free from excessive force, and (2) Hamilton\nCounty and Sheriff Neil are subject to municipal liability for the deputies\u2019 alleged use\nof excessive force.     Nancy Roell also brought intentional-discrimination and failure-to-\naccommodate claims against all of the defendants under Title II of the ADA. Finally, she\nasserted a state-law claim for the wrongful death of Roell against all of the defendants and a\nstate-law claim for assault and battery against Deputies Alexander, Dalid, and Huddleston.\n\n       In February 2016, the defendants filed a \u201cMotion to Dismiss and Motion for Summary\nJudgment\u201d pursuant to Rule 56(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which the district\n\f No. 16-4045               Roell v. Hamilton Cty Bd. of Comm\u2019rs, et al.                    Page 7\n\n\ncourt granted in part and denied the remainder as moot. First, the court held that Deputies\nAlexander, Dalid, and Huddleston were entitled to qualified immunity on Nancy Roell\u2019s \u00a7 1983\nclaim, with the result that Sheriff Neil and Hamilton County were also not liable under \u00a7 1983.\nRoell v. Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Cty. Comm\u2019rs, No. 1:14-CV-637, 2016 WL 4363112, at *14 (S.D.\nOhio Aug. 16, 2016). The court next ruled that Nancy Roell had failed to establish a viable\nclaim under the ADA because she did not produce any evidence that the defendants intentionally\ndiscriminated against Roell because of his disability. Id. Finally, the court held that Nancy\nRoell had abandoned her state-law claims against Hamilton County and Sheriff Neil. The court\nthen declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state-law claims asserted\nagainst the individual deputies and therefore denied as moot the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss\nand/or for summary judgment as to those claims. Id.\n\n       In rendering its decision, however, the district court did not specify whether it resolved\nthe defendants\u2019 motion using the summary-judgment standard or the motion-to-dismiss standard.\nId. But the content of the defendants\u2019 motion, the extensive discovery period, and the court\u2019s\nconsideration of materials outside of the pleadings indicate that the case was decided on\nsummary-judgment grounds. In any event, Nancy Roell appeals only the district court\u2019s grants\nof summary judgment in favor of (1) Deputies Alexander, Dalid, and Huddleston on her \u00a7 1983\nclaim, and (2) Hamilton County on her \u00a7 1983 and her ADA claims.\n\n                                         II. ANALYSIS\n\nA.     Standard of review\n\n       We review de novo a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. Watson v. Cartee,\n817 F.3d 299, 302 (6th Cir. 2016). Summary judgment is appropriate when no genuine dispute\nof material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 56(a). A genuine dispute of material fact exists \u201cif the evidence is such that a reasonable\njury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\u201d Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S.\n242, 248 (1986). The moving party bears the burden to \u201cdemonstrate the absence of a genuine\n[dispute] of material fact.\u201d Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986). Finally, \u201c[i]n\n\f No. 16-4045                Roell v. Hamilton Cty Bd. of Comm\u2019rs, et al.                   Page 8\n\n\nmaking this assessment, we must view all evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving\nparty.\u201d Tennial v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 840 F.3d 292, 301 (6th Cir. 2016).\n\nB.     Nancy Roell\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim against Deputies Alexander, Dalid, and Huddleston\n\n       Nancy Roell claims that Deputies Alexander, Dalid, and Huddleston violated Roell\u2019s\nFourth Amendment rights when they used excessive force to subdue him. The deputies pled the\naffirmative defense of qualified immunity, which \u201cprotects government officials \u2018from liability\nfor civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or\nconstitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u2019\u201d Pearson v. Callahan,\n555 U.S. 223, 231 (2009) (quoting Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982)). Nancy\nRoell bears the \u201cultimate burden of proof\u201d to show that the deputies are not entitled to qualified\nimmunity. See Sheets v. Mullins, 287 F.3d 581, 586 (6th Cir. 2002).\n\n       \u201cWe ask two questions in evaluating whether a law-enforcement officer is entitled to\nqualified immunity on an excessive-force claim: \u2018(1) whether the officer violated the plaintiff\u2019s\nconstitutional rights under the Fourth Amendment; and (2) whether that constitutional right was\nclearly established at the time of the incident.\u2019\u201d Estate of Hill v. Miracle, 853 F.3d 306, 312 (6th\nCir. 2017) (quoting Kent v. Oakland County, 810 F.3d 384, 390 (6th Cir. 2016)).              These\nquestions can be answered in any order. Pearson, 555 U.S. at 236. In holding that the deputies\nwere entitled to qualified immunity, the district court answered both questions in the negative.\nThe court concluded that the deputies did not violate Roell\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights and that,\neven if they did, no caselaw clearly established that the degree of force used by the deputies\nviolated such rights. We will address each of these conclusions in turn.\n\n       1. The deputies likely did not violate Roell\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights.\n\n       The Fourth Amendment \u201cguarantees citizens the right \u2018to be secure in their\npersons . . . against unreasonable . . . seizures\u2019 of the person.\u201d Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386,\n394 (1989). In determining whether an officer has used excessive force in violation of the\nFourth Amendment, \u201cwe employ an objective-reasonableness test, asking \u2018whether the officers\u2019\nactions are objectively reasonable in light of the facts and circumstances confronting them,\nwithout regard to their underlying intent or motivation.\u2019\u201d       Hill, 853 F.3d at 312 (quoting\n\f No. 16-4045                 Roell v. Hamilton Cty Bd. of Comm\u2019rs, et al.                   Page 9\n\n\nGraham, 490 U.S. at 397). This test \u201crequires a careful balancing of \u2018the nature and quality of\nthe intrusion on the individual\u2019s Fourth Amendment interests\u2019 against the countervailing\ngovernmental interests at stake.\u201d Graham, 490 U.S. at 396 (quoting Tennessee v. Garner,\n471 U.S. 1, 7 (1985)).\n\n       The Supreme Court has articulated three factors for us to consider in determining the\nobjective reasonableness of a particular use of force. These factors are (1) \u201cthe severity of the\ncrime at issue,\u201d (2) \u201cwhether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or\nothers,\u201d and (3) \u201cwhether he is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight.\u201d\nGraham, 490 U.S. at 396. In evaluating these factors, we must keep in mind that \u201c[t]he\n\u2018reasonableness\u2019 of a particular use of force must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable\nofficer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight.\u201d Id. Finally, although the\nGraham factors are instructive, they \u201care not an exhaustive list, as the ultimate inquiry is\n\u2018whether the totality of the circumstances justifies a particular sort of seizure.\u2019\u201d Livermore ex\nrel. Rohm v. Lubelan, 476 F.3d 397, 404 (6th Cir. 2007) (quoting St. John v. Hickey, 411 F.3d\n762, 771 (6th Cir. 2005)).\n\n       The first Graham factor\u2014\u201cthe severity of the crime at issue\u201d\u2014supports a finding that\nsome degree of force was justified in order to restrain and arrest Roell. Deputies Alexander,\nDalid, and Huddleston responded to a \u201cneighbor trouble\u201d call and were quickly informed by a\nfrightened Agarwal that Roell was \u201cbreaking things\u201d in her backyard. They found Roell half-\nnaked, muttering unintelligibly, and standing next to a broken window, which they reasonably\ninferred was shattered as a result of Roell\u2019s actions. In other words, Roell had committed a\nseries of property crimes that a reasonable officer could infer might escalate. The fact that Roell\nhad not yet committed a more serious felony did not preclude the deputies from using force to\nrestrain him.   See Cockrell v. City of Cincinnati, 468 F. App\u2019x 491, 495 (6th Cir. 2012)\n(recognizing numerous cases holding that an officer\u2019s use of a taser against a plaintiff who is\n\u201cactively resisting arrest by physically struggling with, threatening, or disobeying officers\u201d is not\na violation of the plaintiff\u2019s clearly established Fourth Amendment rights, even if the plaintiff is\nsuspected of committing only a misdemeanor).\n\f No. 16-4045               Roell v. Hamilton Cty Bd. of Comm\u2019rs, et al.                Page 10\n\n\n       Application of the second Graham factor\u2014whether Roell posed an immediate threat to\nthe deputies or to others\u2014also indicates that the deputies\u2019 use of force was warranted. When the\ndeputies first encountered Roell, he was holding objects that could have been used as weapons\namid a scene of property destruction. See In re Fortney, 832 N.E.2d 1257, 1268\u201369 (Ohio Ct.\nApp. 2005) (noting that Ohio law \u201cdefines a deadly weapon as \u2018any instrument, device, or thing\ncapable of inflicting death, and designed or specially adaptable for use as a weapon, or\npossessed, carried, or used as a weapon\u201d and recognizing that a stick, when used as a club, can\nconstitute a deadly weapon). The deputies therefore had a reasonable basis to believe that Roell\npresented an immediate threat to the Agarwals and to the deputies themselves \u201cin light of the\nfacts and circumstances confronting\u201d them. See Graham, 490 U.S. at 397.\n\n       First, Roell posed a potential threat to the Agarwals, who were still inside the\ncondominium.     Because Roell had already thrown a potted plant through the Agarwal\u2019s\ncondominium window, the deputies were reasonably concerned that he might break into their\nresidence and cause further destruction. Roell also posed an immediate threat to the deputies\nthemselves. Rahana Agarwal, Soham Agarwal, Deputy Alexander, and Deputy Huddleston all\ntestified that Roell quickly approached the deputies while waving the metal nozzle of a hose in a\nthreatening manner. Deputy Huddleston testified that the hose and the metal nozzle could have\nbeen used as a weapon to hit or to choke him.\n\n       Although Soham Agarwal heard Roell say that he had no weapon and heard the deputies\ntell Roell to come over to them, these observations do not create a genuine dispute of material\nfact as to whether Roell approached the deputies in a manner that posed an immediate threat to\ntheir safety. Even if Roell asserted that he was unarmed and moved towards the deputies in\nresponse to their commands, the undisputed evidence regarding the aggressive nature of his\napproach remains unchanged.\n\n       Finally, we turn to the third Graham factor and analyze whether Roell was actively\nresisting arrest. Undisputed record evidence shows that Roell resisted the deputies\u2019 attempts to\nrestrain and handcuff him by kicking, flailing, and wriggling away from their grasp. Nancy\nRoell responds that the deputies \u201cforeseeably caused any resistance or escalated the encounter by\nfailing to use verbal and tactical de-escalation.\u201d But even if we assume that the deputies\n\f No. 16-4045                Roell v. Hamilton Cty Bd. of Comm\u2019rs, et al.                    Page 11\n\n\nescalated the encounter with Roell\u2014an assertion that we find dubious\u2014law-enforcement\nofficers cannot be held liable solely because they created the circumstances requiring the\napplication of force. See Livermore ex rel. Rohm v. Lubelan, 476 F.3d 397, 406 (6th Cir. 2007)\n(rejecting the notion that a \u201cFourth Amendment claim against police officers who used deadly\nforce may survive summary judgment, even where the particular seizure is reasonable, if the\ndefendant police officers acted recklessly in creating the circumstances which required the use of\ndeadly force\u201d). Analysis of the third Graham factor therefore supports our conclusion that the\ndeputies were justified in using some degree of force in attempting to restrain Roell.\n\n       Our analysis of the Graham factors, however, is not the end of the excessive-force\ninquiry. We must also assess whether the \u201ctotality of the circumstances justified\u201d the \u201cparticular\nsort of . . . seizure\u201d imposed upon Roell. See Tennessee v. Garner, 471 U.S. 1, 8\u20139 (1985). The\ntotality of the circumstances includes \u201cthe fact that at the time of the . . . struggle, the defendant\nofficers had reason to believe that [Roell] was either on drugs or mentally unstable.\u201d See Landis\nv. Baker, 297 F. App\u2019x 453, 465 (6th Cir. 2008). Although the officers were unaware that Roell\nwas experiencing an episode of excited delirium, Deputy Huddleston testified that Roell\u2019s\nbehavior indicated that he was suffering from some sort of mental illness.\n\n       The deputies were therefore required to take into account Roell\u2019s diminished capacity\nbefore using force to restrain him. See Champion v. Outlook Nashville, Inc., 380 F.3d 893, 904\n(6th Cir. 2004) (\u201cThe diminished capacity of an unarmed detainee must be taken into account\nwhen assessing the amount of force exerted.\u201d). But no caselaw supports Nancy Roell\u2019s assertion\nthe deputies were prohibited from using any physical force against Roell before first attempting\nalternative de-escalation techniques. See Cook v. Bastin, 590 F. App\u2019x 523, 530 (6th Cir. 2014)\n(holding that no excessive force was used in handcuffing and physically restraining a man\nsuffering from excited delirium who posed a threat to the law-enforcement officers and who was\nresisting arrest). In sum, we agree with the district court\u2019s observation that \u201cthe fact that Roell\u2019s\nresistance was probably caused by his excited delirium did not preclude the deputies from using\na reasonable amount of force to bring him under control.\u201d Roell, 2016 WL 4363112, at *8.\n\n       Despite Roell\u2019s apparent diminished capacity, he had committed a series of property\ncrimes, was a threat to the Agarwals and to the deputies, and was actively resisting arrest.\n\f No. 16-4045                Roell v. Hamilton Cty Bd. of Comm\u2019rs, et al.                   Page 12\n\n\n\u201c[A] reasonable officer on the scene\u201d could have concluded the use of force was necessary based\non the totality of these circumstances. See Graham, 490 U.S. at 396. \u201c[T]he question is not\nwhether any force was justified\u201d but, instead, whether the deputies \u201ccould reasonably use the\ndegree of force employed against\u201d Roell. See Martin v. City of Broadview Heights, 712 F.3d\n951, 958 (6th Cir. 2013) (emphasis in original). The type of force employed by the deputies\nagainst Roell\u2014physically restraining his limbs, wrestling with him, attempting to tase him, and\nshackling his arms and legs\u2014was likely not excessive. But we need not definitively answer this\nquestion because, at the time of the alleged violation, no caselaw clearly established that the\ndegree of force used by the deputies violated Roell\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights.\n\n       2. The constitutional right alleged by Roell was not clearly established.\n\n       \u201cIn order for a right to be clearly established for the purposes of qualified immunity,\n\u2018[t]he contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand\nthat what he is doing violates that right.\u2019\u201d Estate of Hill v. Miracle, 853 F.3d 306, 316 (6th Cir.\n2017) (quoting Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640 (1987)). \u201cThe relevant, dispositive\ninquiry . . . is whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in\nthe situation he confronted.\u201d Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 202 (2001), abrogated on other\ngrounds by Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 236 (2009). We must therefore determine\nwhether a right was clearly established \u201cin light of the specific context of the case, not as a broad\ngeneral proposition.\u201d Id. at 201.\n\n       Requiring this \u201cparticularized\u201d showing \u201cis not to say that an official action is protected\nby qualified immunity unless the very action in question has previously been held unlawful, but\nit is to say that in the light of pre-existing law the unlawfulness must be apparent.\u201d Anderson,\n483 U.S. at 640 (internal citations omitted). The content of this pre-existing law is determined\nby looking \u201cfirst to decisions of the Supreme Court, then to decisions of this court and other\ncourts within our circuit, and finally to decisions of other circuits.\u201d Champion, 380 F.3d at 902\n(quoting Higgason v. Stephens, 288 F.3d 868, 876 (6th Cir. 2002)). \u201cAn action\u2019s unlawfulness\nmay be plain \u2018from direct holdings, from specific examples described as prohibited, or from the\ngeneral reasoning that a court employs\u2019\u201d in these cases. Martin, 712 F.3d at 961 (quoting\nChampion, 380 F.3d at 902).\n\f No. 16-4045               Roell v. Hamilton Cty Bd. of Comm\u2019rs, et al.                  Page 13\n\n\n        With these general principles in mind, we turn to the question at hand: whether Nancy\nRoell has demonstrated \u201cthe prior articulation of a prohibition against the type of excess force\nexerted\u201d against Roell, sufficient to defeat the deputies\u2019 affirmative defense of qualified\nimmunity. See Champion, 380 F.3d at 902. We must determine, in other words, whether a\nreasonable officer would have known that the forcible physical restraint employed in this case\nagainst an individual who appeared mentally impaired, yet posed a potential threat to the officers\nand to others, violated that person\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights.\n\n       Nancy Roell argues that Martin v. City of Broadview Heights, 712 F.3d 951 (6th Cir.\n2013), demonstrates that the deputies violated Roell\u2019s clearly established rights. The decedent in\nMartin broke into an apartment while naked and high on LSD. Id. at 954\u201355. Four police\nofficers arrived on the scene to find Martin speaking quickly and nonsensically. Id. Martin\ncalmed down momentarily to ask for help and to be arrested, but then \u201cjogged away\u201d when the\nofficers tried to handcuff him. Id. The officers caught up with Martin and fell on top of him. In\naddition, they delivered \u201ccompliance body shots\u201d to Martin\u2019s side, struck him in the face with\ntwo \u201chammer punches,\u201d kneeled on his calves, struck his face, back, and ribs at least five times,\nand held Martin in a face-down position. Id. at 954\u201355. Two of the officers heard Martin emit a\n\u201cgurgling sound\u201d during this struggle and, when they rolled him over, he was unresponsive. Id.\nat 955. Although the coroner determined that Martin died from an acute psychotic episode with\nexcited delirium due to intoxication, a forensic pathologist who conducted Martin\u2019s autopsy\nconcluded that asphyxia was the likely cause of his death.\n\n       The Martin court held that \u201c[a] reasonable officer should have known that subduing an\nunarmed, minimally dangerous, and mentally unstable individual with compressive body weight,\nhead and body strikes, neck or chin restraints, and torso locks would violate that person\u2019s clearly\nestablished right to be free from excessive force.\u201d Id. at 693. In doing so, the court observed\nthat the officers were obligated to \u201cde-escalate the situation and adjust the application of force\ndownward\u201d when confronted with an unarmed individual who \u201cexhibited conspicuous signs that\nhe was mentally unstable.\u201d Id. at 962. We agree with the district court, however, that this\nstatement must be viewed in the context of the officers\u2019 applied use of force, which was\ncharacterized by the Martin court as \u201csevere.\u201d Id. at 958; see also Roell, 2016 WL 4363112 at\n\f No. 16-4045               Roell v. Hamilton Cty Bd. of Comm\u2019rs, et al.                 Page 14\n\n\n*9 (\u201cMore reasonably, Martin stands for the proposition that officers should try to de-escalate\nthe situation with a mentally disturbed suspect before resorting immediately to severe force to\nsubdue him.\u201d).\n\n       Unlike the officers in Martin, Deputies Alexander, Dalid, and Huddleston did not\nrepeatedly beat Roell or apply compressive body pressure to his back. They instead \u201cgrappled\nwith Roell\u2019s arms and legs to try to control him, which they eventually did.\u201d Roell, 2016 WL\n4363112 at *9. Deputy Huddleston did attempt to tase Roell, but no electricity was conducted\ninto his body. And although this court has observed that use of a taser entails a higher level of\nforce \u201cthan simply knocking someone back to the ground,\u201d Wells v. City of Dearborn Heights,\n538 F. App\u2019x 631, 639 (6th Cir. 2013), a \u201cgrowing national judicial consensus\u201d exists that the\nuse of a taser in dart mode constitutes only an intermediate use of force. Bryan v. MacPherson,\n630 F.3d 805, 810 (9th Cir. 2010) (Wardlaw, J., concurring). Martin, moreover, was \u201cunarmed\nand minimally dangerous,\u201d whereas Roell was threateningly waving a hose with a metal nozzle\nthat could be used as a weapon.\n\n       Because of these factual differences, Martin did not put the deputies on notice that their\nactions violated Roell\u2019s clearly established right to be free from excessive force. Nor do the\nother cases cited by Nancy Roell, which hold that police use excessive force when they deploy\ngratuitous force or a taser against an individual who is already restrained or is doing nothing to\nresist arrest, provide such notice. See, e.g., Eldridge v. City of Warren, 533 F. App\u2019x 529, 535\n(6th Cir. 2013) (holding that the police used excessive force when they tased an individual who\nwas suffering from a hypoglycemic episode and whose \u201cnoncompliance was not paired with any\nsigns of verbal hostility or physical resistance\u201d); Landis v. Baker, 297 F. App\u2019x 453, 461, 464\n(6th Cir. 2008) (holding that the police used excessive force against an individual suffering from\na mental health crisis who \u201cwas not actively resisting arrest or posing a threat to anyone\u201d when\nthey struck him ten times with a baton, held him face down into two feet of mud and water and\nrepeatedly tased him); Champion v. Outlook Nashville, Inc., 380 F.3d 893, 901 (6th Cir. 2004)\n(holding that the police used excessive force against a severely autistic man who \u201cstopped\nresisting arrest and posed no flight risk\u201d when they \u201csprayed him with pepper spray even after he\nwas immobilized by handcuffs and a hobbling device\u201d). But see Rudlaff v. Gillispie, 791 F.3d\n\f No. 16-4045                 Roell v. Hamilton Cty Bd. of Comm\u2019rs, et al.                Page 15\n\n\n638, 641 (6th Cir. 2015) (collecting cases and concluding that [o]ur cases firmly establish that it\nis not excessive force for the police to tase someone (even multiple times) when the person is\nactively resisting arrest.\u201d (emphasis in original)).\n\n       We believe that this case is instead more analogous to Cook v. Bastin, 590 F. App\u2019x 523\n(6th Cir. 2014). In that case, a severely autistic man became agitated, stripped naked, caused\nextensive property damage to his room in an adult daycare center, and ripped the shirt of the\ndaycare center\u2019s Crisis Manager. Id. at 525. The police arrived to find the man, Roland\nCampbell, digging his lacerated fingers into an electrical socket. They observed the Crisis\nManager\u2019s torn and bloody shirt, which they interpreted as an indication that physical violence\nhad occurred. The officers were told that Campbell was out-of-control, suffered from mental\ndisabilities, and needed to be taken to a mental facility.\n\n       Campbell was handcuffed without incident and placed in a sitting position. While the\npolice waited for the medical transport unit, however, Campbell \u201cbegan thrashing and kicking,\nmaking grunting sounds as he tried to free himself from the handcuffs,\u201d rolled onto a prone\nposition, and began scooting on his stomach towards the doorway. Id. at 526. The officers\nattempted to gain control of Campbell by restraining his arms and legs, while the Crisis Manager\nheld his torso. During the struggle, Campbell pulled the men into the hallway, freed one of his\nhands from the cuffs, and \u201cpick[ed] himself and everybody up off the ground with the one hand\nabout three or four inches.\u201d Id. Campbell then collapsed, fell unconscious, and died as a result\nof acute cardiorespiratory failure. The Cook court held that the degree of force used by the\nofficers was reasonable because Campbell had committed significant property destruction and a\nphysical assault, posed an immediate threat to himself, the officers, and to others, and attempted\nto free himself from the officers\u2019 restraint. Id. at 530\u201331.\n\n       Like Campbell, Roell caused significant property damage, was a threat to the officers and\nto others, and resisted arrest during an episode of excited delirium.         Although Deputies\nAlexander, Dalid and Huddleston did not observe any \u201csigns of physical violence,\u201d they did\nobserve that Roell was holding objects that could be used as weapons. True enough, the\ndeputies\u2019 wrestled with and attempted to tase Roell, arguably deploying a higher level of force\nthan the officers in Campbell. But this court has previously held that an officer\u2019s \u201csingle use of\n\f No. 16-4045                 Roell v. Hamilton Cty Bd. of Comm\u2019rs, et al.               Page 16\n\n\nthe taser in drive-stun mode\u201d against a mentally unstable plaintiff who was a threat to officer\nsafety and his own safety, and who was resisting police attempts to transport him to the hospital,\ndid not constitute excessive force. See Caie v. West Bloomfield Township, 485 F. App\u2019x 92, 94\u2013\n96 (6th Cir. 2012). And there is no question that the degree of force employed by Deputies\nAlexander, Dalid, and Huddleston was far less than the unconstitutionally severe force used by\nthe officers in Martin. In sum, the relevant caselaw does not clearly establish that the deputies\nviolated Roell\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights because their actions fell in the \u201chazy border between\nexcessive and acceptable force.\u201d See Brosseau v. Haugen, 543 U.S. 194, 201 (2004) (quoting\nSaucier, 533 U.S. at 206).\n\n       Finally, Nancy Roell relies on the procedures articulated in the training materials of the\nOhio Peace Officer Training Commission (OPTC) and in proffered expert testimony in an effort\nto prove that Roell\u2019s right to be free from excessive force was clearly established. She first\nargues that the deputies did not follow the OPTC procedures when they neglected to recognize\nthat Roell was exhibiting the common symptoms of excited delirium, proceeded to engage Roell\nbefore staging the scene with multiple officers and medical personnel, and failed to use verbal\nde-escalation techniques before attempting to physically restrain him. Nancy Roell also points to\nthe expert testimony of Dr. Michael Lyman, who stated that de-escalation was the \u201cstandard\ntechnique\u201d recommended for crime-related encounters with excited-delirium subjects and who\nopined that, had the deputies used verbal de-escalation, Roell would have likely been talked into\nsurrendering without an altercation.     Based on this evidence, Nancy Roell argues that the\ndeputies had a \u201cclearly established duty\u201d to use de-escalation techniques prior to using force\nagainst Roell.\n\n       In considering her argument, we must \u201cevaluate the officers\u2019 use of certain tactics \u2018in\nlight of testimony regarding the training that [the officers] received.\u2019\u201d Martin, 712 F.3d at 960\n(quoting Griffith v. Coburn, 473 F.3d 650, 657 (6th Cir. 2007)). But we also must judge the\nreasonableness of a particular use of force \u201cfrom the perspective of a reasonable officer on the\nscene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight.\u201d Graham, 490 U.S. at 396. A finding of\nqualified immunity is therefore not precluded simply because the deputies acted contrary to their\ntraining. City of San Francisco v. Sheehan, 135 S. Ct. 1765, 1777 (2015) (\u201cEven if an officer\n\f No. 16-4045                Roell v. Hamilton Cty Bd. of Comm\u2019rs, et al.                    Page 17\n\n\nacts contrary to her training, however, . . . that does not itself negate qualified immunity where it\nwould otherwise be warranted.\u201d). In addition, although the deputies did not follow every OPTC\nprotocol, we note that the training materials acknowledge that the use of a taser might be\neffective in controlling an individual suffering from excited delirium, that a physical struggle\nmight ensue, and that force might be appropriate or necessary in order to restrain the individual.\n\n         Dr. Lyman\u2019s expert testimony, which essentially opines on the best approach that the\ndeputies could have taken in ideal circumstances, similarly does not establish that the deputies\nviolated Roell\u2019s clearly established rights. As an initial matter,\u201c[t]he Fourth Amendment . . .\ndoes not require police officers to take the better approach[,] . . . only that they take a reasonable\napproach.\u201d Cook v. Bastin, 590 F. App\u2019x 523, 528 (6th Cir. 2014). And \u201cso long as \u2018a\nreasonable officer could have believed that his conduct was justified,\u2019 a plaintiff cannot \u2018avoi[d]\nsummary judgment by simply producing an expert\u2019s report that an officer\u2019s conduct leading up\nto a deadly confrontation was imprudent, inappropriate, or even reckless.\u2019\u201d Sheehan, 135 S. Ct.\nat 1777 (quoting Billington v. Smith, 292 F.3d 1177, 1189 (9th Cir. 2002)).\n\n         In sum, Nancy Roell points to no caselaw clearly establishing that the deputies violated\nRoell\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights in effectuating his arrest.             Even assuming that law-\nenforcement officers must \u201cadjust the application of force downward\u201d when confronted with a\nconspicuously mentally unstable arrestee, Martin, 712 F.3d at 962, no precedent establishes that\nthe level of force used by the deputies in this case was excessive or that the deputies were\nrequired to use only verbal de-escalation techniques. The content of the OPTC training material\nand Nancy Roell\u2019s proffered expert testimony do not change our conclusion.                  Deputies\nAlexander, Dalid, and Huddleston are therefore entitled to qualified immunity, meaning that the\ndistrict court did not err in granting summary judgment to the them on Nancy Roell\u2019s \u00a7 1983\nclaim.\n\nC.       Nancy Roell\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim against Hamilton County\n\n         Nancy Roell also challenges the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of\nHamilton County on her claim for municipal liability under \u00a7 1983. She put forth three theories\nas to why Hamilton County is subject to municipal liability: (1) Hamilton County\u2019s policy and\n\f No. 16-4045                Roell v. Hamilton Cty Bd. of Comm\u2019rs, et al.               Page 18\n\n\ncustom for handling mentally-ill individuals was the driving force behind the deputies\u2019 use of\nexcessive force, (2) Hamilton County failed to adequately train the deputies, and (3) Hamilton\nCounty ratified the deputies\u2019 use of excessive force.\n\n       We recognize that \u201c[a] municipality or county cannot be liable under \u00a7 1983 absent an\nunderlying constitutional violation by its officers.\u201d Blackmore v. Kalamazoo County, 390 F.3d\n890, 900 (6th Cir. 2004). The district court held that Deputies Alexander, Dalid, and Huddleston\ndid not violate Roell\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights under the first prong of the qualified-immunity\nanalysis. It therefore granted summary judgment in favor of Hamilton County based on that\nground and did not address any of Nancy Roell\u2019s theories for municipal liability.\n\n       We, on the other hand, have utilized the second prong of the qualified-immunity analysis\nto conclude that the deputies are entitled to summary judgment because no caselaw clearly\nestablished that the degree of force used by the deputies violated Roell\u2019s Fourth Amendment\nrights. In doing so, we have reached no conclusion with respect to whether Roell\u2019s rights were\nactually violated.   We must therefore address Nancy Roell\u2019s three theories for Hamilton\nCounty\u2019s liability by assuming, without deciding, that Roell\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights were\nviolated by the deputies\u2019 excessive use of force.\n\n       Hamilton County is subject to liability under \u00a7 1983 for its policy on handling mentally\nill individuals only if Nancy Roell can \u201cdemonstrate \u2018a direct causal link between the policy and\nthe alleged constitutional violation.\u2019\u201d See Brown v. Chapman, 814 F.3d 447, 463 (6th Cir. 2016)\n(quoting Graham ex rel. Estate of Graham v. County of Washtenaw, 358 F.3d 377, 383 (6th Cir.\n2004)). But Nancy Roell does not point to any policy that is the \u201cmoving force\u201d behind the\ndeputies\u2019 actions. See id. She instead argues that Hamilton County\u2019s lack of adequate policies\nand training caused the deputies\u2019 use of excessive force.\n\n       Inadequate training can serve as the basis for municipal liability under \u00a7 1983 where it\n\u201camounts to deliberate indifference to the rights of persons with whom the police come into\ncontact.\u201d City of Canton v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378, 388 (1989). To succeed on this claim, Nancy\nRoell \u201cmust show \u2018(1) that a training program is inadequate to the tasks that the officers must\nperform; (2) that the inadequacy is the result of the [County\u2019s] deliberate indifference; and\n\f No. 16-4045               Roell v. Hamilton Cty Bd. of Comm\u2019rs, et al.                  Page 19\n\n\n(3) that the inadequacy is closely related to or actually caused the plaintiff\u2019s injury.\u2019\u201d Brown,\n814 F.3d at 463 (quoting Plinton v. County of Summit, 540 F.3d 459, 464 (6th Cir. 2008)).\nNancy Roell cannot meet the first prong of this test, however, because Hamilton County had a\nsatisfactory training program in place regarding officer interactions with individuals suffering\nfrom mental illness and excited delirium.\n\n       The record shows that the deputies received training on topics that included the use of\nforce and tasers, crisis intervention techniques, interacting with the special-needs population and\nmentally ill suspects, and recognizing the symptoms of excited delirium. Finally, we note that\nNancy Roell\u2019s argument that Hamilton County failed to train its deputies is completely\ninconsistent with her \u00a7 1983 claim that the deputies\u2019 use of excessive force was evidenced by the\nfact that they failed to follow Hamilton County\u2019s procedures regarding officer interactions with\nindividuals suffering from excited delirium.\n\n       This leaves Nancy Roell with her argument that Hamilton County ratified the use of\nexcessive force by Deputies Alexander, Dalid, and Huddleston when it conducted an inadequate\ninvestigation of the events. Specifically, she asserts that the investigation merely rubber-stamped\nthe deputies\u2019 unconstitutional conduct, neglected to discover what actually took place, and failed\nto review whether the deputies\u2019 actions violated Hamilton County\u2019s policies and procedures.\nOnce again, however, the record demonstrates otherwise.\n\n       The internal investigation included interviews of multiple witnesses, detailed fact-\nfinding, and incorporates additional investigations by the Criminal Investigations Unit of the\nSheriff\u2019s Office and the Hamilton County Coroner. In addition, Nancy Roell\u2019s own expert, Dr.\nLyman, testified that he could not think of any additional interviews that should have been\nconducted during the investigation, could not point to any physical evidence that was not\npreserved or test results that were not considered, and could not identify any specific\ninadequacies in the collection of testimonial or tangible evidence. We therefore disagree with\nNancy Roell\u2019s argument that \u201cno serious investigation\u201d occurred regarding the deputies\u2019 use of\nforce. See Marchese v. Lucas, 758 F.2d 181, 188 (6th Cir. 1985). Because Hamilton County is\nnot subject to municipal liability under any of her theories, the district court did not err in\ngranting summary judgment to the county on her \u00a7 1983 claim.\n\f No. 16-4045                Roell v. Hamilton Cty Bd. of Comm\u2019rs, et al.                     Page 20\n\n\nD.       Nancy Roell\u2019s ADA claim against Hamilton County\n\n         Finally, Nancy Roell appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of\nHamilton County based on her claim under Title II of the ADA. Title II provides that \u201cno\nqualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from\nparticipation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity,\nor be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132. Two types of claims\nare cognizable under Title II: claims for intentional discrimination and claims for a reasonable\naccommodation. Ability Ctr. of Greater Toledo v. City of Sandusky, 385 F.3d 901, 907 (6th Cir.\n2004).\n\n         The district court dismissed Nancy Roell\u2019s ADA claim because it found no evidence that\nthe defendants intentionally discriminated against Roell based on his disability. In so holding,\nhowever, the court failed to consider Nancy Roell\u2019s failure-to-accommodate theory. Under this\ntheory, Nancy Roell asserted that Hamilton County had a duty to accommodate Roell\u2019s disability\nby \u201chaving its officers take steps to calm the situation, converse with Mr. Roell in a non-\nthreatening manner, pause to gather information from Rachana Agarwal, refrain from the\napplication of force, and summon EMS to the scene at the earliest moment possible.\u201d\n\n         Neither the Supreme Court nor this circuit has squarely addressed whether Title II of the\nADA applies in the context of an arrest. Nancy Roell urges us, however, to adopt the reasoning\nof several of our sister circuits that have found Title II applicable to law-enforcement activities,\nincluding arrests.\n\n         A few opinions have indeed indicated that arrestees might be able to bring cognizable\nclaims under Title II. But, in doing so, they have also noted that the exigent circumstances\ninherent in an arrest inform the reasonable-accommodation analysis. See, e.g., Sheehan v. City of\nSan Francisco, 743 F.3d 1211, 1232 (9th Cir. 2014), rev\u2019d in part, cert. dismissed in part, 135 S.\nCt. 1765 (2015) (holding that \u201cthe ADA . . . applies to arrests, though we agree with the Eleventh\nand Fourth Circuits that exigent circumstances inform the reasonableness analysis under the\nADA, just as they inform the distinct reasonableness analysis under the Fourth Amendment\u201d);\nBahl v. County of Ramsey, 695 F.3d 778, 784 (8th Cir. 2012) (noting that \u201c[e]ven if the ADA\n\f No. 16-4045                Roell v. Hamilton Cty Bd. of Comm\u2019rs, et al.                 Page 21\n\n\napplied to [a] traffic stop,\u201d the defendant police officer was not required to accommodate the\nplaintiff\u2019s disability \u201cunder the exigencies of the traffic stop\u201d). But see Hainze v. Richards,\n207 F.3d 795, 801 (5th Cir. 2000) (\u201cTitle II does not apply to an officer\u2019s on-the-street responses\nto reported disturbances or other similar incidents, whether or not those calls involve subjects\nwith mental disabilities, prior to the officer\u2019s securing the scene and ensuring that there is no\nthreat to human life.\u201d).\n\n       We need not decide whether Title II applies in the context of arrests because, even if\nNancy Roell\u2019s failure-to-accommodate claim is cognizable, Hamilton County is entitled to\nsummary judgment based on the facts of this case. This circuit has previously held that \u201cthe\n\u2018determination of what constitutes reasonable modification is highly fact-specific, requiring case-\nby-case inquiry.\u2019\u201d Anderson v. City of Blue Ash, 798 F.3d 338, 356 (6th Cir. 2015) (quoting\nLentini v. Cal. Ctr. for the Arts, 370 F.3d 837, 844 (9th Cir. 2004)). Deputies Alexander, Dalid,\nand Huddleston unquestionably faced exigent circumstances while attempting to restrain and\narrest Roell. As detailed above, they responded to an unsecured scene to find an individual who\nhad committed, at the very least, a series of property crimes and who posed a continuing threat to\nthe deputies and to others. In fact, almost immediately after the deputies arrived, Roell swiftly\napproached them brandishing a hose with a metal nozzle and a garden basket. The deputies, in\nother words, were required to make a series of quick, on-the-spot judgments in a continuously\nevolving environment.\n\n       Nancy Roell\u2019s proposed accommodations\u2014that the deputies use verbal de-escalation\ntechniques, gather information from the witnesses, and call EMS services before engaging with\nRoell\u2014were therefore \u201cunreasonable . . . in light of the overriding public safety concerns.\u201d See\nTucker v. Tennessee, 539 F.3d 526, 536 (6th Cir. 2008), abrogated on other grounds by\nAnderson v. City of Blue Ash, 798 F.3d 338 (6th Cir. 2015); cf. Hainze, 207 F.3d at 802\n(recognizing that \u201c[o]nce the area was secure and there was no threat to human safety, the . . .\nSheriff\u2019s deputies would have been under a duty to reasonably accommodate [plaintiff\u2019s]\ndisability in handling and transporting him to a mental health facility\u201d).\n\n       In the context of the exigent circumstances surrounding Roell\u2019s arrest, Nancy Roell\ncannot make out a viable ADA claim under her failure-to-accommodate theory. Nor has she\n\f No. 16-4045               Roell v. Hamilton Cty Bd. of Comm\u2019rs, et al.                Page 22\n\n\npresented any evidence that Hamilton County intentionally discriminated against Roell based on\nhis disability. The district court therefore did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of\nHamilton County on Nancy Roell\u2019s ADA claim.\n\n                                     III. CONCLUSION\n\n       For all of the reasons set forth above, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.\n\f No. 16-4045                Roell v. Hamilton Cty Bd. of Comm\u2019rs, et al.

Our circuit law clearly states that\nwhen an individual \u201cexhibit[s] conspicuous signs that he [is] mentally unstable\u201d and is\n\u201cunarmed,\u201d \u201cChampion require[s] the officers to de-escalate the situation and adjust the\napplication of force downward.\u201d Martin v. City of Broadview Heights, 712 F.3d 951, 962 (6th\nCir. 2013) (quoting Champion v. Outlook Nashville, Inc., 380 F.3d 893, 904 (6th Cir. 2004)).\nThere are disputed facts as to whether Roell was unarmed and as to how aggressively Roell was\nacting, which determine how much force was appropriate. Although the law governing this case\nis clear, the facts surrounding Roell\u2019s death are not.       The district court erred by granting\nsummary judgment on Nancy Roell\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim against Deputies Alexander, Dalid, and\nHuddleston. I would reverse summary judgment on this claim, and I respectfully dissent.\n\n                                     I. GOVERNING LAW\n\n       Because the law governing this case is clearly established and straightforward, I begin by\nsetting out the basic legal principles that govern this case. First, I agree with the majority\u2019s\nrecitation of the familiar summary-judgment standard, although not with its application of the\nstandard to this case. See Maj. Op. at 7\u20138. Second, I agree with its summary of the Graham\nfactors. See Maj. Op. at 8\u20139 (citing Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 396 (1989)).\n\n       As for the law at the heart of this matter, I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s\ncharacterization. Sixth Circuit cases clearly establish that officers must \u201ctake into account \u2018the\ndiminished capacity of an unarmed detainee . . . when assessing the amount of force exerted.\u2019\u201d\nMartin, 712 F.3d 962 (quoting Champion, 380 F.3d at 904). Martin states the rule very simply:\nWhen an individual \u201cexhibit[s] conspicuous signs that he [is] mentally unstable\u201d and is\n\u201cunarmed,\u201d \u201cChampion require[s] the officers to de-escalate the situation and adjust the\napplication of force downward.\u201d Id.; see also Landis v. Baker, 297 F. App\u2019x 453, 465 (6th Cir.\n2008) (\u201cA determination of the reasonableness of the defendant officers\u2019 conduct must take into\naccount the fact that at the time of the fatal struggle, the defendant officers had reason to believe\n\f No. 16-4045               Roell v. Hamilton Cty Bd. of Comm\u2019rs, et al.                  Page 24\n\n\nthat [the arrestee] was either on drugs or mentally unstable and they knew that he was\nunarmed.\u201d). If it is apparent to officers that an individual is unarmed and mentally unstable, then\nthe officers must de-escalate and may not use as much force as would be permissible when\nconfronted with an individual who was either mentally stable or armed.\n\n       While the majority acknowledges that Champion mandates that \u201c[t]he deputies were . . .\nrequired to take into account Roell\u2019s diminished capacity before using force to restrain him,\u201d it\nessentially brushes this requirement aside by asserting that \u201cno caselaw supports Nancy Roell\u2019s\nassertion the deputies were prohibited from using any physical force against Roell before first\nattempting alternative de-escalation techniques.\u201d Maj. Op. at 11. I agree that the deputies were\nnot necessarily prohibited from using any physical force on Gary Roell, but that point is\nirrelevant to this case. The question in this case is whether the officers complied with their\nobligation, under Champion and Martin, to adjust their use of force downward. Even if the\nofficers were permitted to use some physical force, they could have violated Champion and\nMartin by failing to adjust the level of force downward.\n\n                 II. APPLICATION OF THE CLEARLY ESTABLISHED\n                         LAW TO THE FACTS OF THIS CASE\n\n       There are several unresolved questions of fact relevant to whether the officers had, and, if\nso, whether they complied with, an obligation to adjust the level of force downward. There are\nsome basic facts that I agree are not in dispute. No one disputes that Roell had long lived with\nchronic, severe mental illness, including schizoaffective disorder and delusional disorder, nor\ndoes anyone dispute that when he went off his medication he could become unpredictable,\ndangerous, and violent. R. 98 (N. Roell Dep. at 72, 97, 167) (Page ID #4513, 4538, 4608). No\none disputes that at 2:30 a.m. on August 13, the Roells\u2019 neighbor, Rachana Agarwal, woke up to\na loud noise and found Roell standing at Agarwal\u2019s window wearing only a t-shirt, nude from the\nwaist down. R. 90 (Agarwal Dep. at 10) (Page ID #3765); R. 77 (Huddleston Dep. at 66) (Page\nID #493). Scared, Agarwal called 911 and said that her neighbor was \u201cacting crazy.\u201d R. 90\n(Agarwal Dep. at 27) (Page ID #3782). There is no dispute that when the officers arrived on the\nscene, they wrestled with Roell and tased him multiple times before eventually subduing him and\nhandcuffing him with two sets of handcuffs and shackles. R. 77 (Huddleston Dep. at 98\u2013100,\n\f No. 16-4045               Roell v. Hamilton Cty Bd. of Comm\u2019rs, et al.                  Page 25\n\n\n117\u201319) (Page ID #525\u201327, 544\u201346). There is also no dispute that Roell stopped breathing\nwhile he was shackled, that he never regained consciousness, and that he was pronounced dead\nat the hospital. See R. 96-1 (Death Record) (Page ID #4286).\n\n        Beyond these basic facts, there are many disputes over important details of the events\nleading to Roell\u2019s death. First, there is a fact question as to whether Roell was armed, given that\nhe was holding a hose and a hanging planter but may not have been using these items as\nweapons.    Second, there is a fact question as to how aggressively Roell acted when he\napproached the officers. Without resolving these factual disputes, it is impossible to know\nwhether the amount of force was appropriate under the circumstances.\n\nA. We do not know whether Gary Roell was unarmed\n\n        There is a fact question as to whether Roell was unarmed under Ohio law. Determining\nwhether Roell was unarmed is crucial, because if Roell was unarmed, the Champion/Martin rule\nwould apply and require the officers to adjust the level of force downward. If Roell was armed,\nthe Champion/Martin rule would not apply.\n\n        The majority correctly notes that Ohio law \u201cdefines a deadly weapon as \u2018any instrument,\ndevice, or thing capable of inflicting death, and designed or specially adaptable for use as a\nweapon, or possessed, carried, or used as a weapon.\u2019\u201d Maj. Op. at 10 (quoting In re Fortney,\n832 N.E.2d 1257, 1268 (Ohio Ct. App. 2005)). The hose and peat-moss hanging planter are not\ninstruments \u201cdesigned or specially adaptable for use as a weapon\u201d but at least the hose, which\nhad a metal tip, is an instrument that could be \u201cused as a weapon.\u201d In re Fortney, 832 N.E.2d at\n1268.\n\n        The evidence is not clear as to whether Roell was using the peat-moss planter or hose as\nweapons. Soham Agarwal testified that he definitely remembered Roell saying that he did not\nhave a weapon. Soham Agarwal testified that Roell \u201ckept saying he didn\u2019t have a weapon. I\nremember him saying that.\u201d R. 91 (S. Agarwal Dep. at 20) (Page ID #3858). \u201cHe kept shouting\n-- he just kept shouting, I don\u2019t have a weapon. That\u2019s all I could hear him saying.\u201d Id. at 37\u201338\n(Page ID #3875\u201376). Rachana Agarwal testified that she thinks she heard Roell tell the officers\nthat he did not have a weapon. R. 90 (Agarwal Dep. at 75) (Page ID #3830). Huddleston did not\n\f No. 16-4045                Roell v. Hamilton Cty Bd. of Comm\u2019rs, et al.                  Page 26\n\n\nrecall Roell saying that he did not have a weapon. R. 77 (Huddleston Dep. at 68\u201369) (Page ID\n#495\u201396).\n\n         If Roell repeatedly shouted that he did not have a weapon, that indicates that he was not\nusing the hose and peat-moss planter as weapons. Roell\u2019s incoherent mumbling about water also\nindicates that he was holding the hose because he was fixated on the Agarwals\u2019 water, not\nbecause he planned to use the hose as a weapon. R. 90 (Agarwal Dep. at 60) (Page ID #3815).\nOf course, neither Roell\u2019s repeatedly shouting that he did not have a weapon, nor his mumbling\nabout water conclusively prove that he was unarmed. But the innocuous nature of a soft, peat-\nmoss planter, the fact that Roell was mumbling about water while holding the hose, and witness\ntestimony that Roell repeatedly shouted that he was unarmed at least create a question of\nmaterial fact as to whether Roell was using the planter and hose as weapons.\n\nB. We do not know how aggressively Gary Roell was acting\n\n         The majority attempts to justify the level of force the officers used by arguing that the\nsituation may have been on the brink of escalating and arguing that Roell was acting\naggressively. In fact, it is not clear how aggressively Roell was acting, meaning that it is not\nclear how much force might have been appropriate under the circumstances. Moreover, neither\nof these arguments takes into account the obligation to adjust the level of force downward when\nconfronted with an apparently mentally unstable and unarmed individual.\n\n         The majority states that there is undisputed evidence of the aggressive nature of the way\nRoell approached the officers. Maj. Op. at 10. In fact, the testimony does not make clear how\naggressively Roell was acting when he approached the officers.             At least three different\nwitnesses testified in three different ways about why and how Gary Roell approached the officers\nwhen he arrived at the Agarwals\u2019 house. Huddleston\u2019s testimony largely mirrored the testimony\nof the other officers. He testified that Roell, unprompted, \u201cturned around and started coming\ntoward myself and Deputy Alexander in an aggressive manner.\u201d R. 77 (Huddleston Dep. at 67)\n(Page ID #494). Huddleston also testified that he did not tell Roell to walk toward him, but\nrather \u201ctold [Roell] to drop what he had in his hands and get on the ground.\u201d Id. at 68 (Page ID\n#495).\n\f No. 16-4045                  Roell v. Hamilton Cty Bd. of Comm\u2019rs, et al.                      Page 27\n\n\n        Agarwal was more equivocal. At one point she testified that \u201cI saw the hose and him,\nyou know, running with it towards the officers.\u201d R. 90 (Agarwal Dep. at 38) (Page ID #3793).\nLater, she testified that she \u201ccannot say that for sure now\u201d whether Roell was running or\nwalking, id. at 44 (Page ID #3799), and \u201cI don\u2019t want to say running, but I saw him going\ntowards the officer with that thing [the hose] in his hand,\u201d id. at 50 (Page ID #3805); see also id.\nat 56 (Page ID #3811). Agarwal also testified that it was not as if Roell was approaching the\nofficers and they were standing still, but rather that Roell and the officers \u201cwere both moving\ntowards each other.\u201d Id. at 42 (Page ID #3796).\n\n        In starker contrast to Huddleston\u2019s testimony, Agarwal\u2019s son, Soham Agarwal, recalled\nthat Gary Roell approached the officers because they instructed him to do so. R. 91 (S. Agarwal\nDep. at 20) (Page ID #3858). He said:\n\n        Q.      So after the police officers arrived, what was the first thing you heard\n                either Gary or the officers say to each other?\n        A.      I think the first thing I heard was the officers telling him to like cooperate\n                or to come over there, to stop doing what he was doing when they came\n                into the backyard.\n        Q.      So they said come over to them? Is that what you heard?\n        A.      Something like that, yes.\n\nId. at 37\u201338 (Page ID #3875\u201376).\n\n        In support of its contention that there is undisputed evidence of the aggressive nature of\nthe way Roell approached the officers, the majority states that Soham Agarwal testified that\n\u201cRoell was facing the deputies swinging the hose \u2018as if he was trying to hit somebody.\u2019\u201d Maj.\nOp. at 4 (quoting R. 91 (S. Agarwal Dep. at 32) (Page ID #3870)). This statement slightly\nmischaracterizes Soham Agarwal\u2019s testimony, and, although slight, the difference between\nSoham Agarwal\u2019s testimony and the majority\u2019s characterization of Soham Agarwal\u2019s testimony\nis important. Soham Agarwal actually testified that Roell had something in his hand, and that\nwhile \u201cit was a little dark still, so it was hard to tell what it was. . . . it seemed like it was the hose\nthat he had held previously -- and that he was kind of like swinging it around, as if he was trying\nto hit somebody.\u201d      R. 91 (S. Agarwal Dep. at 32) (Page ID #3870).                Obviously, Soham\nAgarwal\u2019s testimony does not unequivocally state that Roell was acting in a calm, unaggressive\n\f No. 16-4045                Roell v. Hamilton Cty Bd. of Comm\u2019rs, et al.                  Page 28\n\n\nmanner, but it also does not unequivocally state that Roell was swinging the hose as if he was\ntrying to hit someone. Instead, Soham Agarwal stated that it was dark enough that it was hard to\ntell what was happening, that Roell was holding something that \u201cseemed like it was the hose,\u201d\nand that Roell was \u201ckind of like swinging\u201d whatever he was holding \u201cas if he was trying to hit\nsomebody.\u201d Id. This distinction is important because, along with Rachana Agarwal\u2019s testimony,\nit underscores that it was not at all clear to the disinterested witnesses how aggressively (or\nunaggressively) Roell was acting. It was Huddleston, rather than Soham or Rachana Agarwal,\nwho characterized Roell as aggressive.\n\n       The majority also states that although Roell committed only property crimes, it was\nreasonable for the officers to infer that his crimes might escalate and therefore reasonable for\nthem to tase him. Maj. Op. at 9. First of all, this point is debatable. The only support the\nmajority offers is an unpublished case that is distinguishable because it held that tasing the\nsuspect did not clearly constitute excessive force because the suspect was fleeing. See Cockrell\nv. City of Cincinnati, 468 F. App\u2019x 491, 498 (6th Cir. 2012) (\u201c[I]t is not clear whether tasing a\nsuspect who fled from the scene of a nonviolent misdemeanor constituted excessive force, as of\nJuly 2008.\u201d); see also id. (Cole, C.J., concurring) (\u201cI am persuaded that Cockrell, as of July 3,\n2008, did not have a clearly established right not to be tased for fleeing from a non-violent\nmisdemeanor. I write separately because, given the totality of the circumstances, I believe that\nOfficer Hall\u2019s use of force was excessive.\u201d). Second, even if tasing an unarmed individual is not\ngenerally a constitutional violation, that does not change the fact that officers have an obligation\nto adjust the level of force downward if the individual is apparently mentally unstable and\nunarmed. Even if an officer generally is permitted to tase an individual who is suspected of\ncommitting only misdemeanors, that does not mean that that the officers in this case were\npermitted to tase Roell, given that he was apparently mentally unstable and may have been\nunarmed.\n\n       The majority also attempts to analogize this case to Cook v. Bastin, 590 F. App\u2019x 523\n(6th Cir. 2014), but in doing so notes that in Cook the officers observed Campbell \u201cdigging his\nlacerated fingers into an electrical socket\u201d and \u201cobserved the Crisis Manager\u2019s torn and bloody\nshirt, which they interpreted as an indication that physical violence had occurred.\u201d Maj. Op. at\n\f No. 16-4045                Roell v. Hamilton Cty Bd. of Comm\u2019rs, et al.                      Page 29\n\n\n15. This case is dissimilar to Cook because the officers observed no signs that violence had\noccurred, only signs that property damage occurred. In addition, as the majority acknowledges,\nthe officers in Cook used less force than the officers in this case used against Roell. Id.\n\nC. There are disputed facts, making summary judgment inappropriate\n\n       Because we do not know whether Gary Roell was unarmed according to Ohio law, we do\nnot know whether the Champion/Martin rule applies to the officers\u2019 confrontation with Roell.\nSee Martin, 712 F.3d at 962 (quoting Champion, 380 F.3d at 904) (officers must \u201ctake into\naccount \u2018the diminished capacity of an unarmed detainee . . . when assessing the amount of force\nexerted\u2019\u201d). Because we do not know how aggressively Roell was acting, we do not know\nwhether the level of force the officers used was appropriate under the circumstances. As a result,\nsummary judgment is not an appropriate resolution of this case. A jury should resolve the\ndisputed, material facts and ultimately determine whether the officers complied with their\nobligation to adjust the level of force downward. Therefore, as to the majority\u2019s resolution of\nNancy Roell\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim against Deputies Alexander, Dalid, and Huddleston, I respectfully\ndissent.\n\f"
