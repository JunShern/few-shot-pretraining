    "text": "Seemingly out of nowhere, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei stated Thursday that Iran won\u2019t sign off on any final nuclear agreement unless military sites are declared off limits to foreign inspectors.\n\nAlso added is the requirement that the United States will have to drop all economic sanctions against the beleaguered country on the day the agreement is signed, The New York Times reports. This marks the first time Khamenei has made any substantive public comments on the proposed framework which was introduced last week in Lausanne, Switzerland.\n\nKhamanei was cautious about the prospects of negotiations but emphasized that Iran would not be taken in by \u201cdevilish\u201d intentions stemming from the United States.\n\n\u201cI neither support nor oppose the deal. Everything is in the details, it may be that the deceptive other side wants to restrict us in the details,\u201d Khamenei said, according to Reuters.\n\nThe State Department responded on Thursday, saying that it intends to gradually pull back sanctions \u201cin a phased manner upon verification that Iran has met specific commitments.\u201d Exactly what those requirements are will set the stage for the next phase of the discussion.\n\nJeff Rathke, the spokesman for the State Department, did not specifically address Khamanei\u2019s remarks, but what\u2019s unclear is how sanctions can be eased if inspection of military facilities is forbidden. So far, Secretary of State John Kerry has maintained that the inspection requirements will be quite involved, but it\u2019s not yet known whether he intends for those requirements to extend to military facilities.\n\nOne of the military sites, Parchin, has not been mentioned in the international framework at all in distinct contrast to sites like Fordow and Natanz, which are widely discussed in the arrangement. It is widely suspected that Parchin would host Iran\u2019s weaponization efforts, making it a key site for inspection.\n\nIran\u2019s president, Hassan Rouhani, echoed the remarks of the supreme leader.\n\n\u201cWe will not sign any agreement unless all economic sanctions are totally lifted on the first day of the implementation of the deal,\u201d Rouhani said.\n\nThe final deadline is June 30, which gives some amount of time for Secretary of State John Kerry and his team to work out the thorny details of what one of the most invasive inspection regimes in history will look like.\n\nFollow Jonah Bennett on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
