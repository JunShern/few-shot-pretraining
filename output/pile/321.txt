It's too big and not preferred here, but can't find way to change it. Don't know if this is because it's mono developed, don't praise that either, but I searched in all folders where bless is \"unpacked\":\n/usr/lib/bless  \n/usr/share/bless \n\nand then:\n~/.config/bless\n\nThere is no file where font is defined.\n\nA:\n\nAlthough font can't be set from editor, bless comes with extensive help system, where it is explained that, font tag can be used as child element in <display> tag in bless layouts configuration files (w/o example)\nIn action:  \n\nopen /usr/share/bless/bless-default.layout \non every <area> element add <display> child element (if not defined) in which child element <font> can be set  \n\n<area type=\"ascii\">\n    <display><font>Droid Sans Mono 9</font></display>\n</area>\n\n"
