    "text": "Australia's Peter Senior, 53, became the oldest Australian Open champion by 10 years, as the previous record holder was Peter Thomson, who won the title at age 43.\n\nIn case you missed it this weekend, Australia's Peter Senior pulled off an amazing feat Down Under, winning the Australian Open at the age of 53, to become the tournament's oldest winner. It was the second Australian Open title for the appropriately named Senior, but the incredible thing about it is that his two wins came 23 years apart -- also a record.\n\nAs reported by Martin Blake of emiratesaustralianopen.com.au:\n\nHe is the oldest winner of any top-level Australian tour event, having set the previous record himself when he won the Australian PGA at Coolum in 2010 at 51.\n\n\"It doesn\u2019t get any better than this,\" said Senior, a profoundly popular figure in the Australian golf industry over three decades.\n\nKudos to Senior. It seems all we talk about lately is the supreme talent of players at such a young age. For instance, New Zealand's Lydia Ko became the youngest LPGA winner earlier this season when she captured the Canadian Women's Open at 15 years, 4 months and 3 days. More recently, Guan Tianlang of China -- just 14 years old -- became the youngest player ever to qualify for the Masters after his win at the Asia-Pacific Championship in November.\n\nWhile it's fantastic to see that the future of the game is in great hands with the performances of these young players, it's also nice on occasion to see someone like Senior get the job done."
