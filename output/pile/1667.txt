The free downloads are little \"cardlets\" (that's my new word, because they are small little cards) that I placed in the middle of each standard sized card (A2) over some matting, and popped them up with 3D foam dots.\n\nI printed my cardlets on photo paper so they are glossy, and made them about 2\" x 2-1/2\" in size.Go to the link at the beginning of my post to download these for FREE. They are only available through February, 2014.\n\nHere you can see how the little cardlet is popped off the page and is glossy.\n\nI matted each cardlet with one or two pieces of cardstock, or little doilies (Martha Stewart), and added a bow and some ribbon and a few gems. On the last card, I used a scrap of cardstock (black and white), and liked how it looked against the bright pink and red heart background (old scrap I had). I also used some of CTMH's red shimmer trim.\n\nThese were super simple and fast and I loved how they turned out.\n\nIf you need to make a quick and fast card today, print out these little cardlets (any size) and slap one on a piece of cardstock and stick it to a card, add 3 gems and voila! your done! All of my printers are on the blink, so I used my tiny little photo printer and printed all the cards on a 5x7 piece of glossy photo paper. (Where there's a will, there's a way).\n\nDownload them from HERE. Have fun and treat yourself to some chocolate today!"
