    "text": "Wednesday, April 30, 2008\n\nThe BCS is just fine thanks\n\nBCS caretakers are currently huddled in an oceanfront resort in Florida discussing any tweaks to make the system better. [extreme sarcasm on] As if you could make this perfect system better?!? [extreme sarcasm off] Up for discussion is the idea of a plus-one model where four teams would participate in a semifinal before the actual national championship. Now, we at TNL highly endorse anything that gets college football closer to a playoff to truly decide the national champion... like... on the field... you know... so it's actually won and not calculated by some computer. What a thought.\n\nUnfortunately, standing in the way with crossed arms and a stern look is none other than our glorious commissioner Jim Delany.\n\nThe plus-one may not seem complicated. But the plan requires unanimous approval, and the Big Ten and Pac-10 have already made clear they oppose it. The other conferences have been noncommittal.\n\nBig Ten commissioner Jim Delany said Monday that moving to a plus-one would equate to a playoff, and he sees no support for that option among the league's pesidents.\n\nGod, Jim's easy to love isn't he? But don't throw hate Jim's way it's not all his fault, or so he would have you believe.\n\n\"The perception that the Big Ten and Pac-10 are holding this back is not right,\" Delany said, after exiting a Tuesday morning meeting of conference commissioners and bowl and television representatives at an oceanfront hotel here. \"We're seen as obstructionists when we did what we did to evolve the system. The calls for change are external. Ask others here how strongly they feel for a call for change. I don't see it.\"\n\n\"I think there are a lot of other people who like where they are, but they should say it,\" Delany said. \"There are others in the room who like where we're at. There are no raised voices here. Everybody's mind is open for discussion.\"\n\nYes, I'm sure all the commissioners from the major conferences love the cash cow that you've created for them and don't want that aspect to change. While I could sit here and opine all day about the financial side of things the truth of the matter is this system has very little support among the people that actually support the schools: the fans. But don't let that get in the way, we're unimportant. [extreme sarcasm on] What's really at stake here is the student athletes. [extreme sarcasm off]\n\nSwofford said league commissioners and athletic directors attending the BCS meetings have raised specific concerns about the plus-one model. The logistical difficulties of getting a team from a potential semifinal game at Dolphin Stadium in Miami to a championship game in Glendale, Ariz., seven days later, is among the concerns. Swofford said having a two-week period between the semifinals and BCS title game, like the NFL does with the conference championship games and Super Bowl, probably isn't plausible because university presidents have adamantly opposed extending college football's postseason beyond he first week of January.\n\n\"You run into the problem of taking it too deeply into second semester, which the presidential level says is unacceptable,\" Swofford said.\n\nYes, getting a WHOLE team from point A to point B WOULD prove extremely difficult because it's so hard to find a plane these days. We certainly wouldn't want to run into the second semester because... ah... well... I have no idea but it's just bad, take our word for it. As silly as that is the next statement is just absurd on new levels.\n\n\"The BCS has had controversy, but it's done some things well,\" Delany said. \"I think everybody would have to concede it has done some things well. Even when the coaches and sportswriters were determining the national champion, there was controversy.\"\n\nDelany said college football's rising popularity is proof the current BCS format works.\n\nFirst and foremost I concede nothing, it's a heaping pile of smelly dog shit that is worse than the previous method and solves nothing. The only thing it's accomplished is to create a revenue stream for the major conferences and their members while all but eliminating small schools from getting their piece of the pie. It has done a fantastic job at that but I wouldn't call that a good thing. Lastly, Delany must have smoked some good shit in Florida if he thinks his last statement isn't retarded in every sense of the word. The rising popularity is proof that the BCS is liked by the fans?!? By that logic one could conclude that the explosion of AIDS in Africa is proof people actually like the disease. Sorry, Jim I don't believe you when you say there isn't voice for change and I certainly don't believe you when you say the BCS is in good standing. It sucks and the people that suffer the most are the fans. Ask administrators from Georgia and USC what they think of the system. Hell, ask coach Paterno what he thinks of the system, he'll be happy to tell you to remove the C from the BCS, he's said so in the past. Until there's something that resembles a playoff I'll forever wave my flag.\n\n6 comments:\n\nAnonymous\nsaid...\n\nWhy wouldn't the Big Ten want to keep the current system. It has allowed an unworthy Ohio State team to get into the championship game the last two years. With all their returning players they probably have a good chance of getting back again for a third beat down next year.\n\nAs a college football fan I desperately want a least a plus-one, but would definitely prefer that a playoff be implemented to 1A. I would accept at least the plus-one, but think about having 11 conference champions plus 5 at large bids playing in december/january. Yes it might be difficult and blah blah blah. Its all excuses because this is about the haves and have-nots. The big-six don't want the other conferences getting into their part of the college football money pie, which right now is being handsomely funded by the networks.\n\nThe big ten benefits the most because due to all the special rose bowl deals we're virtually garunteed two spots every year.\n\nCommon, you guys have to admit it is just not feasible for fans to travel through a playoff system to watch their team win a national championship. While I once agreed to sell my first born for the ticket money if Penn State ever makes a national title appearance again, imagine if the Lions were to go through a 2 round playoff in 2005.\n\nI traveled to the Orange bowl in 2005 and the trip was tiring and expensive. Transportation, hotels, dining, and tickets for Miami alone was enough to set me back quite a bit. But a BCS win was well worth it. Now imagine if it was a playoff system and Penn State had to travel to Tempe to face the winner of USC-Texas.\n\nNot only do fans have short notice to plan their next destination, imagine the logistical and financial burdens you are asking of loyal fans.\n\nJust making my voice heard supporting a very unpopular system we have currently. I have more here:\n\nA full blown playoff with 8 teams (which would mean three rounds) played in the bowls would not be feasible for fans. But a two game playoff? You know, where there's money to be made there will be opportunity. Travel agencies would buy blocks of hotel rooms at each of the sites of the plus one and offer package deals for fans. If your team doesn't win, no problem you get a refund but they could offer cheep round trip airfare/hotel combinations. They would definitely figure something out to make it affordable.\n\nI think any playoff would need to have a homefield aspect to it with the exception of the championship game. It's about time Southern teams come up to play in the cold instead of northern fans always having to travel half the country for games."
