    "text": "Q:\n\nWhat is the purpose of dividing an audio signal into segments and analysis each segment?\n\nI read bunch of materials for extracting feature from audio signal and they all tell me to break signal into segments, why don't we analyze all the audio signal? I don't know what are the advantages of doing that and how wide a segment should be? I only see 256 samples per frame or 512 samples per frame... what about 1028 per frame?\n\nA:\n\nAnalyzing signals per segments, with proper windowing, is a way to cope with non-stationary in audio samples.  With full-size analysis, features can get mixed. Segment-splitting is thus at play in many algorithms (mp3, shazam).\nThe length of window is often a matter of trade-offs, between data information and computing advantages:\n\nsignal sampling (window length is quite meaningless without sampling rate), with respect to the following:\nanalyzing or extracting informational content from the signal: various ranges of stationarity may exist in the data, or generally useful processing features,\neasiness in computing: the power-of-two length you mention can be beneficial (faster algorithms like in the FFT), parallel computing, dedicated hardware, closer to real-time analysis.\n\n"
