    "text": "Tuesday, February 22, 2011\n\nWe're still not sure what her real name is. As T.S. Elliot said, \"...a cat needs a name that's particular,A name that's peculiar, and more dignified,Else how can he keep up his (her) tail perpendicular,Or spread out his (her) whiskers, or cherish his (her) pride?\"So we use Miss Puss until we learn her \"ineffable effableEffanineffable, Deep and inscrutable singular Name.\"For now, it's just Miss Puss. A HAH, I hear you say. So Georgina FINALLY consented to put her pussy up on the web!\n\nMy reporter friend, Kevin Modesti, whom I met when he was covering Marilyn Chamber's Bon Voyage party atPismo Beach last year, (if you didn't know, Marilyn died April 12th, 2009)\n\nYeah, so anyway - John and I got chatting with Kevin and we have since become lunch buddies.\n\nHe brought his new pal, Randy Farhi along to the last such meeting. What a bright, charming lady. Her brother, Paul Farhi, is a reporter with The Washington Post and is a frequent guest on the political shows on MSNBC and such. Sorry, I can't resist dropping a name when it's such a significant one.\n\nKevin and I exchange books. I read something I think hemight like, I pass it along to him. He does the same for me. Now we've got Randy in the loop.\n\nPoor dear. I just laid the first of Neal Stephenson's marathon Baroque Cycle (a not-so-brief history of commerce and communication) upon her. It's called Quicksilver and it's quite addictive. I'm sure I shall rot in hell for leading her down this path.\n\nSo, now I have two \"new\" eyes.\n\nHere's me with just the first one done and the second still under wraps.\n\nNew kitty is not impressed.\n\nA shout out to Doctor Robert Feinfield, my surgeon - who just happens to produce music in his spare time for a good cause.\n\nMy dentist is a sculptor. I expect my GP to hand me a movie script any day now. Gawd, I love living in El Lay.\n\nWednesday, February 2, 2011\n\nEven though the few moments I got to share with John on camera are not included in this tribute - I spent a long time savoring these images. I gather the score is John signing and playing one of his own compositions.\n\nJohn was an accomplished Blues musician and produced a well reviewed CD called In The Kitchen. His CD may be still be purchased for $20 from his estate. Checks or money orders should be sent to:\n\nAbout Me\n\nAt 74, I'm enjoying my retirement from a twenty year career as a desktop publisher, which followed a career as an actress in both mainstream film and theater and underground (yes many were pornographic)films. Before that, I was a dancer. Even made it to a lead role in a Broadway show, The Pajama Game, in 1955. In 1957, when the show closed in New York, I toured South Africa with it. Heady stuff."
