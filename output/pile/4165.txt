In the wake of the former president of Cuba Fidel Castro Ruz\u2019s visit in 2000, president Canel\u2019s visit gathered around 2000 people. Although the room was packed, moderators of the event called guests to give space to other guests who were still waiting outside at the front of the event.\n\nThe crowd was so excited. At the beginning of the event, the chants \u201cCuba Libre / Free Cuba\u201d and \u201cQue Viva / Long Live\u201d were heard a lot. After Gail Walker, Executive Director of IFCOO/ Pastors For Peace and Frank Velgara made opening remarks, the Healing Drum Collective, the Riverside Church Praise Team, and Cuban pianist Dayramir Gonzalez presented their musical performance to guests.\n\nUS graduates of the Latin American School of Medicine (ELAM) took to the stage as well to introduce the opportunities that the Cuban state provided. Over 28,500 medical students from 103 countries have graduated, completely free of charge, from ELAM since the first graduation in 2005.\n\nThe Cuban Blockade Grows Stronger\n\nIn the event, a press releases issued by the Permanent Mission of Cuba to the United Nations was distributed to the press members and guests. According to the September 14, 2018 press release, the \u201cNational Security Presidential Memorandum on the Strengthening of the United States Policy toward Cuba\u201d signed on June 16, 2017, in Miami by the current Donald Trump administration has caused a setback of the position of the previous Obama administration.\n\nAs a consequence, the US departments of Commerce, Treasury and State issued new provisions and regulations. Restrictions and limitations to trips and educational trips were imposed, which caused a decrease in travelers from the US to Cuba during 2018, negatively effecting tens of thousands of Cuban workers.\n\nAccording to the same press release, the Department of State issued a \u201cList of Restricted Cuban Entities and Subentities,\u201d which included 179 companies. The aim of this measure is \u201cto continue to impede the economic and commercial relations of Cuban companies with the potential US and third-country partners.\u201d\n\nThe President of Venezuela, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro: \u201cWe have been the victim of unanimous imperialist aggression\u201d\n\nOne of the last speakers of the event was Venezuelan president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. After president Maduro addressed the general debate of the 73rd Session of the General Assembly of the United Nations, he attended the event \u201cCuba Speaks for Itself\u201d\n\nHis stated reason for attending was \u201cto bring the truth of Venezuela, and to expose it to the US people\u2026 to bring my love and solidarity to all of you and to share with my dear brother, the president of Cuba, Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel and Cuban people in all\u201d\n\nHe underlined that Venezuela has been \u201cthe victim of a great imperialist aggression.\u201d However, he ended his speech by saying that \u201cThe Bolivarian revolution is standing, is alive and is victorious.\u201d\n\nMiguel D\u00edaz-Canel, The President of Cuba, said Cuba is in favor of total disarmament and international solidarity\n\nNewly elected president of Cuba, Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel, made several remarks on the current struggle of the country, historical moments that took place in the church, and Cuban foreign policy.\n\nPresident Canel stated that they are \u201cin support of Venezuela, in support of Nicaragua, in support of Puerto Rico, and in support of all Latin America, Palestinian and Saharan people, and all just causes around the world, and also to denounce very unfair blockade that the US government has imposed on us for nearly 60 years\u201d\n\nHe expressed and shared many emotions in the cathedral as he remembered the past, when the leader of the Cuban Revolution, Fidel Castro Ruz, visited Harlem in 1960 and 2000. The Cuban president said \u201cIn order to for us to get here, we drove through the Harlem neighborhood. The place of legendary hotel Teressa, which welcome our first revolutionary delegation to the UN and hosted meetings of great men of the 20th century, for Fidel met Malcolm X, Nasser, Nehru, and Khrushchev.\u201d He added one of Fidel Castro\u2019s personal memory \u201cHe had personally told his comrades I am going to Harlem because that\u2019s where my best friends are.\u201d\n\nPresident Canel also remarked that \u201cCuba is not a large or powerful country. Not rich in natural or resources, but these limitations have not stopped us from practicing solidarity on the basis of sharing what we have.\u201d\n\nHe pointed out that \u201cThis is why when Cuba comes to the UN General Assembly and promotes cooperation and solidarity, as opposed to threats, competition, racism, and selfishness, Cuba does so with the authority of the people that have shown it is possible to achieve those goals in a country that has turned words into concrete actions.\u201d\n\nCuba helped to educate more than 1 million professionals who have served several countries in Asia, Africa, Latin American and the Caribbean since the revolution. Over 42,000 professionals, particularly medical staff, currently are in the service of those countries for engineering, health and medical services, agronomy, and other important domains of development.\n\nThe Cuban president claimed that \u201cI would dare to say that with 5% of that (armament) expenditure a lot of people would be lifted out poverty\u2026The foreign policy of the Cuban revolution maintains its consistent position in favor of total disarmament and international solidarity.\u201d\n\nCategories: Cuba, International, U.S. News, Venezuela"
