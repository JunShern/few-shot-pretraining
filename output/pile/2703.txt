I suggest you simply parse this out yourself.  See my answer here for how to do this:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/a/4914538/362536\nAlternatively, you can just access /7.html on SHOUTcast servers, and you will get a line like this:\n1,1,15,625,1,128,Oh Mercy - Stay, Please Stay\n\nThe fields are:\n\nNumber of listeners\nStream status (1 means you're on the air, 0 means the source isn't there)\nPeak number of listeners for this server run\nMax number of simultaneous listeners the server is configured to allow\nThe unique number of listeners, based on IP\nCurrent bitrate in kilobits\nThe title.  (Note, even if you have a comma in your title, it isn't escaped or anything.)\n\nBeware though that /7.html isn't always available on non-SHOUTcast servers, and may not be available in the beta of the new version.  While this is a quick and easy method, you would be better off parsing the metadata sent to clients.\n\n"
