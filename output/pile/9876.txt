    "text": "Tag: challenge\n\nIf you read my recent post, Beautifully, you may know that I decided to go the month of February without wearing makeup. It was an interesting and difficult experience that I would like to share with you.\n\nI have to confess, the first two weeks or so \u2013 and especially the first few days \u2013 I nearly forgot that I wasn\u2019t using any makeup and I would pull it out and set it on the counter only then to remember that no matter how much I wanted to, I couldn\u2019t use it. In part this was because of the fact that I had become so used to going into the bathroom first thing in the morning and slathering on foundation, blinking into mascara and putting on chap-stick at the very least. There was also a part of me that truly did not want to put myself through this, and just wanted to give up and forget I had ever decided this in the first place.\n\nBut mostly, it was difficult to look in the mirror at my hyper-pigmented, scarred and blemished skin and small eyes that begged for mascara and eyeliner, and not be able to cover it up and hide the things I really didn\u2019t like seeing in the mirror. So many times I argued with myself in the morning, coming close to slipping up and falling back into the routine I had become so used to.\n\nBut I didn\u2019t.\n\nI\u2019m not writing this because I want pity \u2013 or recognition for muddling through it for that matter.\n\nBut, In blunt honesty, the entire month was hard.\n\nReally hard.\n\nI avoided mirrors so I wouldn\u2019t have to look at myself. I had to keep reminding myself why I was doing what I was, but even that was unconvincing.\n\nMy most powerful lesson came after I had begun to wear makeup again.\n\nI play piano, have for eleven years, which means I often get volunteered to play for events \u2013 especially at church. Anyway, the women\u2019s ministry we have at my church had asked me to play for them at an event on Saturday, which meant I got to listen to the speaker they had lined up. She said something important in her lesson that I didn\u2019t realize the power of until I was driving home after the event. It sounded a little something like this:\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter what you look like. It doesn\u2019t matter if you are \u201ctoo thin\u201d or \u201ctoo fat\u201d, whether you have wrinkles or scars. You are made, fearfully and wonderfully in the image of God, and YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL and WORTHY despite the things you don\u2019t like when you look in the mirror.\n\nI\u2019m paraphrasing a little, but this was the context of what she said, and I was blown away. It seems like women are told something like this all the time \u2013 by our parents, our friends, our significant other \u2013 you name it. How many of us actually believe it? Ha.\n\nYet, to doubt our own beauty and worth is to doubt that God\u2019s creation is perfect and that he made each of us, knit us and molded us so intricately.\n\nTo not love ourselves and how we look is, frankly, an insult to God\u2019s handiwork.So why is it so easy to pick and choose what we like and dislike about ourselves, and beat ourselves up over those things we have deemed unworthy and not beautiful?\n\nI wish that I had a good answer for this, but I truthfully don\u2019t. It\u2019s hard to love the things we find so easy to hate. There are many days that I get so worked up in comparing myself to others and picking apart my flaws that I bring myself to tears. .\n\nI see so many others feeling the same, and it breaks my heart.\n\nSo, if you are reading this, I challenge you.\n\nDon\u2019t allow makeup to enslave you like I did, like so many other women have.\n\nFreely, unashamedly look into mirrors and tell yourself how beautiful you are \u2013 even if you don\u2019t feel that way \u2013 until you believe it. God made every piece of you, He has numbered the hairs on your head and He loves every last inch of you. In you, He created a lovely and fearless soul and He will gently remind you day by day how much you are worth if you let Him.\n\nI have challenged myself to do the same.\n\nBecause I can promise you that you are fearfully, wonderfully, beautifully, intricately made in the image of a perfect, glorious and loving God.\n\nToday might just have been the worst I have had for awhile and even though part of me would love to throw myself a pity party, I won\u2019t bore you with the details.\n\nI\u2019m the type of person to \u2018go home and cry about it\u2019 whenever something bad happens. This is not a good quality, I know\u2026 But this particular \u201ccrappy\u201d day acted as the smack in the face that I honestly needed. So instead of my usual moping on the couch with comfort food and Modern Family, I decided to seek out the reason behind the fact that today was simply the breaking point to a few weeks of not feeling myself.\n\nHere\u2019s the deal: I\u2019m really skilled at faking it, but most days my self confidence is definitely lacking, and for whatever reason this had been even more of an issue for the last month or so. My life is filled with so many awesome women, yet I can\u2019t help be a little intimidated, constantly wondering why I am not as beautiful as them.\n\nI realize that this is a question straight from the pit of Hell. I get that. But some days, I ask it anyway. So in a feeble attempt to make myself feel better, I have become reliant on makeup. I\u2019ve never been one to wear a lot of it, but I have been one to hide behind the makeup I do wear.\n\nI guess a little bit of backstory would be good here\u2026 My mom used to be a consultant for Mary Kay, so I have had access to makeup for as long as I can remember. I got my hands on my first tube of mascara in sixth grade \u2013 next came foundation, and you know the rest of this story.\n\nMaybe it is because I am very introverted, or perhaps it is because I take everything that is said to me a little too seriously, but it freaked me out when someone would point out that my skin wasn\u2019t blemish free, hence I caked on the makeup to try to hide it. When it was addressed that I have \u201csmall eyes\u201d, eyeliner became my best friend. In fact, I haven\u2019t gone out in public without any makeup for years.\n\nFirst of all, I realize that there are women who can confidently go without makeup and are perfectly fine with it. I am not one of them. That being said, I have come to the conclusion that I want to be!\n\nSo for the next month I am going to step wayyyyyyy out of my comfort zone and not wear a drop of makeup.\n\nIt is going to be a challenge, but my prayer is that it can teach me that my beauty comes from within, not from covering up and hiding the things that I think aren\u2019t beautiful. Because deep down, I\u2019d rather be known for having a beautiful heart than for having a pretty face.\n\nHere goes!\n\nDo not let your adorning be external\u2014but let your adorning be the hidden person of the heart with the imperishable beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which in God\u2019s sight is very precious. (1 Peter 3:3-4)"
