    "text": "Leave your childhood behind: a GI Joe comic all grown up\n\nI\u2019ve been holding onto this title for a while and after this last issue, I have to let it out. I was a huge GI Joe fan when I was growing up. So much so that in middle school I wrote an exposition essay about my childhood obsession and got a perfect 5/5. The huge battlegrounds my brother and I used to setup with the small, plastic figures all over our backyard were extensive and amazing. Zip lines, sand pits, water hazards, and epic battles. I was a storm shadow kid myself. I loved the ninjas, but something about the ninja in white just did it for me.\n\nCobra\n\nWhen I jumped back into collecting comics I immediately set my sights on the GI Joe titles. IDW was releasing them title after title and when the movie came out, there was a boom in new interest. There are many titles including GI Joe, GI Joe: Origins, and the one you should be reading, GI Joe: Cobra.\n\nThis title, Cobra, is written by Mike Costa and Christos Gage with art by Antonio Fusio. It follows a double agent for the Joe\u2019s who has recently infiltrated Cobra. I called it a grown up GI Joe because this book is sort of an all hands off approach to what is otherwise a pretty long standing world. I recently saw an interview with Costa who said IDW and Hasbro were all for him taking this story in any direction he saw fit. Costa had been writing on the Transformers story (also recommended) and was asked to take the lead on this new Joe title. He admitted to not being much of a fan and decided to basically say \u201cno one is safe,\u201d and man, NO ONE is safe in this story line. There are so many shocker moments, so many deaths from central figures, you just feel like you are watching an agent lose his grip on reality. The most recent issue, all spoilers aside, is jaw dropping. The action is fast, the pacing is perfect, the art a great match. Heavy inks, jagged lines. I can\u2019t recommend this story enough.\n\nFor those that haven\u2019t seen Max Landis\u2019 \u201cThe Death and Return of Superman\u201d, you\u2019re missing out on pure internet gold. The short film takes a whimsical, and drunken, look at one of the most important events in comic book history, The Death and Return of Superman (see above..doi).\n\nMarvel\u2019s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. was our idea. Yep, that\u2019s right, we thought of it way back in July of 2012. You want evidence? Fine! Check out episode 69 of Rated NA right around the 34 minute mark. Okay, we realize we\u2019re probably not the only group of geeks on the planet that fantasized about a S.H.I.E.L.D. television series before it was announced last year, but we like to feel special on occasion."
