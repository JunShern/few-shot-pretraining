This means that our \u2018hero,\u2019 Graham, only has 2 weeks to commit the perfect- and last- crime.\n\nOnce again, this is a very good example of \u2018just because there are pictures does not mean this book is for children.\u2019 At all. I enjoyed this- it was dark, gritty, and definitely in the vein of noir crime novels. I consider the main character to be an homage to Sin City\u2018s Marv, but I could be wrong. Expect the same level of violence, etc.\n\nClick here to go to this article at JCL Reads or click the cover image to learn more about Last Days."
