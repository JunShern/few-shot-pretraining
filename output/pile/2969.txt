I know the name of the file, however I don't want to go searching the tree for it.  I would like a way to enter just the file name, and have emacs search for me.  I should also be able to enter the base directory I want to start the search from, and emacs should remember that for future searches.\n\nA:\n\nSounds like you are looking for the equivalent of Textmate's Command-T functionality. The closest I have found for emacs is find-file-in-project. It can be bound to C-t or a similar key for convenience: (global-set-key \"\\C-t\" 'ido-find-file-in-tag-files)\n\nA:\n\nM-x find-name-dired is the built-in solution for this. The default directory changes according to the current buffer, but the minibuffer history contains the previous selections.\n\n"
