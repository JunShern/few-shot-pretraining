    "text": "A flood of renewable capacity in the European Union is forcing member countries to consider grid upgrades that offer a more substantial power supply management role to distribution system operators.\n\nWith the final numbers now in, European grid operators and regulators report that almost 90% of all new power coming online in the European Union (EU) last year came from renewable sources. This trend is anything but over: Of the 24.5 GW of new capacity built across the EU in 2016, 21.1 GW\u2014or 86%\u2014was from wind, solar, biomass, and hydro, eclipsing the previous record of 79% in 2014.\n\nAlso, for the first time, wind farms now account for more than half of installed capacity in the region, according to data from trade group WindEurope. Wind energy has now also overtaken coal as the EU\u2019s second largest source of power capacity after natural gas\u2014though due to the technology\u2019s intermittent nature, coal still meets more of the bloc\u2019s actual electricity demand. Gas, because of its expense, remains primarily as a back up to maintain grid integrity.\n\n1. A gust for the grid. The influx of renewable power in Europe may require an expansion of its grid and upgrades to its distribution networks, along with measures such as smart grid technologies and demand response. Courtesy: Tennet\n\nNot surprisingly, Germany installed the most new wind capacity in 2016. However, France, the Netherlands, Finland, Ireland, and Lithuania all set new records for wind farm installations too. Although total capacity added was 3% lower than in 2015, a surge in offshore wind farms\u2014which are twice as expensive as those built on land\u2014saw investment from nearly every European country (including in Britain, which has opted to leave the EU), hitting a record \u20ac27.5 billion.\n\nIntegrating Renewables\n\nWith renewables booming, one of the biggest challenges for European distribution systems operators (DSOs) is integrating all these new intermittent sources that are coming online, which often flood into existing grid systems. According to the European Commission (EC), to keep up the pace with the estimated renewable expansion, \u20ac400 billion worth of new distribution network investments will be needed across Europe by 2020.\n\nGoing forward, if electric vehicles catch on in Europe (so far they have not), even more complexity could be added to the situation. Also challenging the status quo: As the price of solar continues to fall and small-scale installs remain popular, increasing amounts of \u201cprosumers\u201d have also come into the market.\n\nThese developments are birthing new, innovative, tech-heavy smart meters and smart grids, which are now being built across Europe. Throughout the region, the distribution grid will have to rapidly adapt as the wind gush is upending how energy needs to flow.\n\nOverall, integration of decentralized sources along with robust demand-side management/response may allow DSOs to become central platforms for the energy transition by coordinating between energy producers and consumers\u2014attempting to play something of a neutral referee. DSOs have to straddle the boundaries between existing and emerging fields, particularly flexibility, energy storage, data handling, and analysis, providing real-time information as well as helping to analyze where markets are heading\u2014all, perhaps, while subtly helping involved parties move in concert.\n\nA Flurry of Mergers and Acquisitions\n\nOver the next three years, many of Europe\u2019s top utilities are planning to invest tens of billions of euros to catch up with the green energy revolution. One simple growth path is through acquisitions. This is driving a flurry of takeovers by tech and engineering firms of niche, smart-energy innovators, according to reports by Reuters and other news organizations.\n\n\u201cEverywhere in the supply chain of power there is disruption going on,\u201d said Bruce Jenkyn-Jones, co-head of listed equities at Impax Asset Management, which focuses on investments in environmental markets and resource efficiency.\n\nThe massive volume of renewables coming online has translated into a need for intelligent information technology (IT) systems that can balance out demand and supply swings while meeting energy and carbon emissions targets. Industrial and technology providers like Siemens, ABB, General Electric (GE), and others have become key players in this transformation, often working in close partnership with grid developers and operators to manage the grid\u2019s evolution.\n\nMerger and acquisition activity is also moving forward in storage and smart meter providers, both of which are key sectors in securing access to customers and, more importantly, their data, to help the utilities tailor their power purchases and save costs. According to Reuters, three major German meter makers\u2014Techem, Ista, and Qundis\u2014are up for sale, and in France, energy conglomerate Total recently purchased battery maker Saft Groupe for \u20ac950 million.\n\nAcross the pond, Oracle took over Opower, a maker of utility software, in a bid to reap key markets, especially emerging European ones. Other niche players being showcased include U.S. smart meter maker Itron, which relies on Europe for more than a third of its sales.\n\nUtilities Prioritize Network Upgrades\n\nTogether, major European utilities may spend more than \u20ac40 billion over the next three years to upgrade their networks, according to ongoing investment plans. This includes replacing old cables, buying new smart meters, and putting new IT in place. These investments follow almost a decade of steep losses for major power producers like E.ON and RWE, which hemorrhaged many billions of euros in value as their fossil fuel systems were marginalized by increasingly less-expensive renewables.\n\nAlso in France, national utility EDF is moving quickly to install smart meters as that nation looks to increase renewable systems. The country\u2019s future, however, is clouded by upcoming elections that could change its energy direction back towards nuclear. But if a left-leaning coalition government comes into office, then renewables will likely continue to grow there as well.\n\nGoldman Sachs estimates power producers might invest more than \u20ac60 billion by 2025 to digitalize their grids. In Europe, big conglomerates, including ABB and Siemens, are so far seen as the leading integrated providers of smart grid technology and hardware, simply because they already cover a wide range of sectors, including IT.\n\n\u201cSometimes it is hard to draw the line between IT and industrials. A company like Siemens is a bit of both,\u201d Frederic Fayolle, senior fund manager at Deutsche Asset Management, said. GE in November bought Bit Stew Systems and Wise.io to expand its platform for industrial internet applications, which connect big machines such as power plants to databases and analytical software.\n\nUtilities, however, will likely stay on the sidelines rather than become developers themselves. \u201cI doubt that a utility can compete with Siemens, GE, nor with Google and Apple,\u201d said Oskar Tijs, senior investment analyst at NN Investment Partners. \u201cOn the grid side, the utilities will be mostly clients of technology companies.\u201d\n\nNew Technology, New Partnerships: E.ON and Siemens\n\nMeanwhile, a partnership between E.ON and Siemens is breaking new ground as it develops smart metering technology in Germany. The collaboration forms part of E.ON and Siemens\u2019 efforts to contribute towards Germany\u2019s plan to replace, process, and systemically convert a large numbers of meters. Additionally, Siemens is providing its smart grid platform EnergyIP for integration with E.ON\u2019s existing EniM program.\n\nAccording to Siemens, the integration will allow E.ON network operators ease and optimal integration of smart metering infrastructure into IT systems to allow meter data acquisition for improved grid management and customer billing. \u201cBy integrating EnergyIP into our systems, we will be able to offer our customers the best possible advice and support with regard to the smart meter rollout,\u201d said Paul-Vincent Abs, metering managing director at E.ON.\n\nLooking ahead, \u201cwith implementation of our EnergyIP smart grid application platform, E.ON Metering is prepared for future rollout scenarios as a metering point operator and, when it comes, to smart meter gateway administration,\u201d said Ute Redecker, head of the Siemens Digital Grid business unit in Germany. The integration will allow the analytics application to utilize various big data options for administering smart meter gateways and meter data processing for external market participants on the German market.\n\nSiemens hopes the development will yield a rich treasure of finely granulated data for functionalities including energy theft and overloaded distribution equipment detections through grid load analysis, grid incident analysis, and end-customer consumption load analysis. In other words, Siemens will have a clear insight not only into E.ON\u2019s grid, but a much better platform on which to build going forward, as other grid operators tackle the demands of a renewable energy backbone. The inclusion of the big data option will also allow for the creation of load forecasts for different levels in the distribution grid as well as an analysis of distributed energy resources.\n\nEU Steps Up Funding for New Energy Infrastructure\n\nIn February, the EC announced that it would fund almost half a billion euros in selected power, smart grid, and gas energy infrastructure projects through the Connecting Europe Facility, the EU\u2019s funding scheme for infrastructure. An ongoing project\u2014valued at a total \u20ac5.35 billion\u2014has been allocated to trans-European energy infrastructure between 2014 and 2020. This year, more than a third of the selected projects are in the energy sector, winning support of \u20ac176 million.\n\nAnother EC\u2013funded project is a \u20ac40.25 million investment in Tennet\u2019s \u201cSuedLink\u201d smart grid system. The project is planned to connect wind power generated in breezy northern Germany with consumer and industrial centers in the nation\u2019s economically booming south. To do this and get buy-in from conservatives in Bavaria annoyed by the \u201cunsightliness\u201d of so many new wind towers, the project will require over 700 kilometers of new, buried underground, high-voltage cables\u2014the first system of its kind on such a large scale. Despite everything else Germany has done, this represents the nation\u2019s largest energy infrastructure project to date.\n\nOne of the challenges the nation faces is that Germany has an ambitious objective: to get 80% of its power supply from renewables by mid-century. To do that, not only do existing power grids have to be upgraded, but also political compromises have to be made. SuedLink satisfies what has been something of an imbroglio that has gridlocked future renewable development in the nation.\n\nThe north has offshore wind, but the south has the load that needs it. Sitting in between have been a lot of folks already shocked by the transformation of Germany\u2019s landscape to accommodate the Energiewende. New transmission lines across conservative Bavaria have long been politically unpopular and local opposition has been a serious bottleneck.\n\nGerman energy companies are pouring resources into digitalization across the entire value chain of the industry, writes Bernward Janzing in the Handelsblatt, a German language business newspaper. Both old, established companies and new, creative start-ups are jumping on board, he writes. \u201cDigitalisation is one of the biggest topics in the energy industry,\u201d Janzing quoted Stefan Kapferer, head of the German Association of Energy and Water Industries, as saying.\n\nInterflex: Demonstrating a Grid Revolution\n\nAnother new initiative announced this year, again with key participation by E.ON, is the new European smart grid project, InterFlex, which aims to explore new ways of using various forms of flexibilities to optimize electric power systems on a local scale.\n\nCoordinated by the University of Aachen, the project focuses on the interoperability of systems, the replicability of solutions, and on the possible resulting business models. Twenty industrial partners, including utilities, manufacturers, and research centers, are involved in the project, which has a budget of \u20ac23 million and seeks to apply smart grid technologies at an industrial scale to achieve a high penetration of renewables.\n\nPart of the biggest current EU Research and Innovation program, Horizon 2020, InterFlex is scheduled to run three years. During that time, project participants will investigate the interactions between flexibilities provided by energy market players and the distribution grid, with a particular focus on energy storage, smart charging of electric vehicles, demand response, islanding, grid automation, and the integration of different types of energy carriers (gas, heat, electricity). Project findings will allow consortium members to replicate the demonstrated solutions and business models. Their overarching goal is to further develop advanced monitoring, local energy control, and flexibility services at the EU level.\n\nSix projects (Figure 2) are slated for demonstration by five European distribution companies\u2014CEZ Distribuce (Czech Republic), Enedis (France), E.ON (Sweden), Enexis (The Netherlands), and Avacon (Germany). The demonstration project in Germany will be implemented by Avacon, a German grid operator belonging to the E.ON group. Avacon will manage a centralized platform of flexibilities and distributed energy resources in a rural area to use energy only where it is generated in order to relieve congestion on the distribution grid.\n\n2. A continental experiment. InterFlex, a three-year-long European smart grid demonstration, kicked off in January 2017, seeking to investigate interactions between flexibilities provided by energy market players and the distribution grid. It will involve six demonstrations hosted by five European distribution companies as shown here. Courtesy: Trialog\n\nE.ON subsidiary Sverige, will undertake two projects. One is in Malm\u00f6, Sweden, designed to study energy integration, using the heat inertia of buildings as a flexibility measurement to achieve more optimized and environmentally friendly production throughout a distributed energy system. The other is in southern Sweden. It will explore ways of operating part of a distribution grid on a stand-alone basis (\u201cislanding\u201d).\n\nNiceGrid\u2014a demonstration project located in Nice, France\u2014will be spearheaded by Enedis. It is pioneering peer-to-peer energy exchanges between solar photovoltaic installations and storage suppliers, allowing the integration of intermittent renewable energy into the distribution grid to be maximized.\n\nCEZ Distribuce will lead another project to use grid automation and energy storage to integrate decentralized renewable energy within the distribution grid. Smart functions for electric vehicle charging stations will also be developed as a source of flexibility.\n\nFinally, the Enexis demonstrator project, in Eindhoven, Netherlands, proposes a multiservice approach to harnessing local flexibilities. It will use stationary storage and electric vehicle batteries, and involve distribution system operators, charge point operators for electric vehicles, and other relevant parties. \u25a0\n\n\u2014Lee Buchsbaum (www.lmbphotography.com), a former editor and contributor to Coal Age, Mining, and EnergyBiz, has covered coal and other industrial subjects for nearly 20 years and is a seasoned industrial photographer."
