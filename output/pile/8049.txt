    "text": "40 Chinese students from the School of Automobile and Mechanical Engineering, Changsha University of Science & Technology (CSUST) have used 3D printing to build a race car. The Chinese are pinning their hopes on 3D printing to boos their automotive and aerospace industries.\n\nIt\u2019s been reported in a number of posts, news articles, and even on local television shows that two mysterious giant boxes have appeared in the San Francisco harbor next to Treasure Island and another one just like it is being constructed in the Portland Main harbor. The boxes are roughly four stories tall, 250 feet long, and 70 feet wide. They are made from cargo containers stacked on barges and, according to the reports, everyone is pretty sure the structures belong to Google.\n\nWhen he was the god of code at iD Software, he would have Microsoft's DirectX developers begging him for his support. That was just 3D, now Carmack is going to spice up our reality and he is still the king of gaming.\n\nDisplay technology hasn't kept up with the improvements in hardware graphics from the likes of companies like Nvidia. So, fully rendered 3D gaming experiences are not all they can be. Now, engineers at Nvidia want to make your display play ball with your graphics hardware to give you the best experience possible.\n\nChinese chip maker Allwinner has published a roadmap detailing its upcoming ARM-based processors, including the dual-core ARM Cortex-A7 chip for entry-level tables and the A80 octa-core SoC for higher-end devices.\n\nIt's code-named \"Cinnamon,\" and it has no release date or intended price however, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos likes to keep his hardware costs down. In that regard, we can expect him to enter into the fray against Apple TV at $99 and Roku at $50. I'll throw in Chromecast at $35 because, I like it better than the set-top box (STB) stuff.\n\nThis is a simple game made in 24 hours for the Microsoft Hack-a-Thon. The project uses an Arduino, Bluetooth module and Android phone. The project won first place in the hardware division and first overall. Check it out, it's pretty cool what these guys pulled off.\n\nIf Google starts to get really evil its redemption will come from having given us Chromecast. This $11 piece of hardware should, unless the world is insane, kill the attached computing display for ever. Because, we should never have to lug around a laptop, or set up a room with a projector or a TV for meetings, or even have to go through the nightmare that is Hulu Plus on Tivo Premier.\n\nWe decided to go old school when we saw this ranking for the best computer cases for airflow. So many memories. Good times. It made us nostalgic for the days when size mattered. When power mattered and you could roast a turkey in a high-end rig.\n\nTeenage freshman at Stanford has a project that uses Google Glass to help people with autism to read another person's emotions. Autism is characterized by deficiencies in social interaction, emotional and non-verbal communication.\nAccording to a report in Medical Daily:\n\nWell, the Europeans, especially the Germans, are not taking the whole NSA thing lightly. They are not happy. But, real hackers claim it is all a publicity stunt and no one is going to be really safe. We are all doomed to being snooped.\nTwo of the largest ISPs in Germany are going to encrypt emails in response to German consumer concerns about US intelligence snooping:\n\nIf you count the promise of a 3 month subscription to Netflix then, maybe. The buzz on Chromecast is strong. At $11 it is pointless not to buy one or put your order in right now. Somewhere, at some cable company, an executive is falling and no one is there to hear him crash.\n\nYes, endoscopy devices are really useful. Less invasive than traditional surgical procedures, and with the addition of more things like 3D cameras, they will turn you inside and out. There's a lot of hidden financial booty for companies working their way up your booty."
