    "text": "From the Best and Brightest Files: Another Alleged 'Canadian', Another Bonafide Jihadi\n\nShirdon, who was enrolled in the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology until at least 2012, appears in an ISIS video released two months ago.\n\nBefore burning his Canadian passport, Shirdon, in full view of the camera lens, issues a threat to Canada, the U.S. and \"all oppressors.\"\n\n\"We are coming and we will destroy you by the will of God,\" Shirdon says on the video.\n\nHe comes from a prominent and well-educated Somali family. His father\u2019s brother, Abdi Farah Shirdon, was a former prime minister of Somalia who has survived numerous attempts on his life by al-Shabab militants fighting for an Islamic state in Somalia under the banner of al-Qaeda.\n\nShirdon\u2019s mother and sister live in Calgary and are deeply involved in the religious life of their community. CBC News reached out to them repeatedly, but they would only say they are \"confused and pained by Farah\u2019s choice,\" before asking for privacy.\n\nThough it\u2019s unclear how real his threats are, Shirdon is the latest young man from Calgary to be identified by CBC News as a Canadian fighting overseas.\n\nHey, the guy's Somali so cut him a break. You weren't expecting much from him anyway were you?\n\nHe's from a people who couldn't be bothered to learn and remember their alleged ancient script so had to adopt the English Latin alphabet in the 1970s just to catch up with the rest of the world. How about that? Somalia didn't have a functioning alphabet until the late 20th century yet our immigration department thinks that somehow importing thousands of Somalis will enrich the country and give Canada a competitive edge on the world stage.\n\n7 comments:\n\nCassandra\nsaid...\n\nthis is not left vs right, Tories vs Liberals, Socialism vs liberty. This is war against White people.\n\nWhy do hostile elite defend Israel as a Jewish ethnostate with Jewish only immigration, but ravage White majority Europe/North America into a multi-ethnic, multi-cultural Gulag with non-White colonization?\n\nThe world is 93% non-White, only 7% White. But 3rd world colonizers, Muslims, Punjabis, Chinese, are aggressively advancing their agenda to annihilate gullible Whites, just as China annihilates Tibet.\n\nPax, they don't even bother selecting the immigrants any more. They must have stopped selecting them in the late 1980's. Every time I visit Toronto and environs, I see tonnes of morbidly obese blacks from the Caribbean, elderly Hindus and Sikhs from India, Somali Muslims and other vile, diseased trash from the third world. It's like they're scooping them up and dumping them here, as if Canada were some kind of dumping ground for the third world. And these people are supposed to take over Canada in the next 2 or 3 decades. It's embarrassing! Looks like a third world Canada is in the works.\n\nEither we stop all third world immigration NOW or we're all immigrating to some place in eastern Europe in the next 10 or 20 years. Heaven help us all!\n\nWe don't attract the best and brightest. This should be obvious to anyone who lives in a major Canadian city. When the Philippines tops the list of source countries it's clear you don't seem to give a shit anymore. All that matters now is that they vote for you political party and can carry a mortgage.\n\ncan you delete my comments and the reply threads ,from this post and the previous post.\n\nFine.\n\nBut you're going to have to tell me which anon is you.\n\nIf you're the anon trying to excuse non-Europeans of the crime of native land theft then I can understand why because deep down you have no argument. If Europeans are imperialist land thieves then so are non-Europeans right down to their modern day Canadian born descendants."
