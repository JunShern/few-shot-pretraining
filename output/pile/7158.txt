    "text": "Q:\n\nWhy does first version document show as minor version?\n\nWhen I allow SharePoint 2013 to create major and minor versions, the first document uploaded shows up as a minor version. It has a decimal number instead of a whole number. Shouldn't it show up as a major version with a whole number? \nHowever, when I only allow Major Versions, the document is uploaded as a Major Version.\nThanks for your help.\n\nA:\n\nNo. When minor versioning is used, the initial upload will be .1 and will continue to increment upward until the file is Published as a major version. At that point, it will be 1.0.\nThis is the draft versioning and publishing type scenario where you work on a document and publish it when it is finished. \nMajor versioning only does just that, increments major version numbers on every change of the document, no matter how small or insignificant. The notion of going from a 1.0 to a 2.0 usually implies some significant change. In this case, you can quickly go from 1.0 to 7.0, by rephrasing something, then fixing a typo, then later altering metadata. \n\n"
