It seems that there are ways to get an application to complete some remaining tasks but not continue to run indefinitely in the background.\nMy app has timers set to go off so audio clips can be played to the user.  What happens is once the app is backgrounded the clips are not played.  I know this can be done somehow as I have run a couple apps like what I am trying to do that are handling it.  One example being: Nike+ GPS  Are these apps just never calling endBackgroundTask?\n\nA:\n\nThere are some scenarios where your App can run in the Background.\nCheck: http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/iphone/conceptual/iphoneosprogrammingguide/BackgroundExecution/BackgroundExecution.html\n\naudio.
