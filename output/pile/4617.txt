However, you can load .cgwdtheme files through the terminal. I recommended emerald since it is really cool.\n\nThis is a common mistake caused by disabling some plugins in CompizConfig Settings Manager. To fix, open the manager (System > Preferences > CompizConfig Settings Manager) and find the \"Window Decorations\" plugin. Check the box and you're all set.\n\nSystem > Preferences > Advanced Desktop Effects Settings, go to General Options, Desktop Size tab, and make sure Horizontal Virtual Size is set to 4.
