    "text": "Q:\n\nWhat style of lager is Corona? And what other beers are similar?\n\nCorona Extra is a Mexican beer that is very popular (in Australia anyway). Most people seem to like it for it's drinkability, and suitability for enjoyment in hot weather.\nIs there a name for this style of lager? Eg; I don't think it's a pilsener or dark lager.\nAnd what other beers are in the same style?\n\nA:\n\nThe BJCP classifies Corona Extra as a Premium American Lager, being, clear, yellow, not hoppy but with a little more body than a light. \nAssuming 'dry' isn't some radically different beer, the category would probably still be correct. BJCP draft guidelines (not official) consider putting Asahi Super Dry and Corona Extra in  2A 'International Pale Lagers' which is 'Loosely derived from original Pilsner-type lagers....'\n1MB PDF if you want to read the draft.\n\n"
