Pure speculation on our part but considering SOMA is now making some very noticeable moves in the space, it won\u2019t be long until bigger exchanges take note. We don\u2019t expect a Market Cap of $500k to stick for much longer.\n\nData provided by CoinRanking.com\n\nRecent Developments\n\nIn terms of price action, Endor has been recovering from the initial decline in value the project saw after its ICO. Fundamentals are all there and growing.
