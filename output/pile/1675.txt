    "text": "Q:\n\nWhat is the number of people that leave the meeting?\n\nIn a business meeting, each person shakes hands with each other person, with the exception of Mr. L. Since Mr. L arrives after some people have left, he shakes hands only with those present. If the total number of handshakes is exactly 100, how many people left the meeting before Mr. L arrived? (Nobody shakes hands with the same person more than once.)\nThe question is from CMI2011 UG entrance exam paper. \n\nA:\n\nLet $n$ be the total number of people at the meeting before Mr. L arrived. Then the number of handshakes will be $\\dfrac{n(n-1)}{2}$. Suppose $m$ people left before Mr. L arrived .So he shakes $n-m$ hands. Then\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}+n-m & =100\\\\\nn^2+n-2m & = 200\\\\\nm & = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}-100.\n\\end{align*}\nBut $0 < m < n$ (assuming that at least one person left). So we want\n\\begin{align*}\n0 & < \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}-100 < n\\\\\n200 & < n(n+1) < 2n+\\color{red}{200}.\n\\end{align*}\nedit:\nI had made a typo because of which my initial conclusion was incorrect:\nThe first inequality suggests that $n \\geq 14$ but the second inequality suggests $n \\leq 14$. So $n=14$ is the answer. This yields $m=5$.\n\n"
