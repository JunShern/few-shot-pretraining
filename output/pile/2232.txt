The subproject and investigator (PI) may have received primary funding from another NIH source, and thus could be represented in other CRISP entries. The institution listed is for the Center, which is not necessarily the institution for the investigator. Given the ubiquitous nature of the peptide linkage in biological molecules, replacement of the amide bond with isosteres in potential drug candidates has been a continual goal of many laboratories. Successful replacements will provide improved stability, lipophilicity, and absorption. Many surrogates have been introduced already, yet the synthesis of many of these isosteres in a combinatorial way is difficult and requires several steps. Thus, the discovery of new peptide surrogates with easier syntheses is an important achievement that could open new opportunities for the study of amide-containing molecules and the development of inhibitors with novel physicochemical properties."
