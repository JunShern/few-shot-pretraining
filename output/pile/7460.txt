I wouldn't have hired me in 2006.\n\n\n\nWould you hire you now? I mean, has it made you less employable for life? Or did you go back to being as employable as before, or more so?

Everybody does something when they're not working. Just as an example, (and to be clear I do not do this, it's very illegal) I would love to avoid hiring married people with young children. Nothing sucks more time than kids, and children are always prioritized over work. I've had major problems with parents in the past. Major, major problems. If it weren't illegal, I'd hire the unkempt surly gamer with a neckbeard over the married professional guy with a lovely wife and infant at home any day of the week. Any day, any way. If only it were possible.\n\n\n\nI also wouldn't hire anyone over 50, women, or cripples. Old people leave at 4:59:59.999, women get married and quit working or take long maternity leaves or sue your ass for harassment, and no matter what they may think, being unable to hobble with that crutch faster than 0.4MPH does impair your ability to do a white collar job, Quasimodo. But hey, all illegal.\n\nsinij\n\nPosts: 2597\n\n\n\n\n\nTerracotta ArmyPosts: 2597 Reply #30 on: December 14, 2008, 04:45:06 AM Just like I wouldn't talk with anyone who is not involved in it about my sex life, I wouldn't discuss my gaming habits. For example I wouldn't discuss WoW at my BDSM meets, they would think I am a pervert. \u00ab Last Edit: December 14, 2008, 04:52:57 AM by sinij \u00bb Eternity is a very long time, especially towards the end."
