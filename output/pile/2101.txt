For the reasons expressed herein, we do not believe it\nnecessary to reinstate that authority. Rather, we conclude that the author\u00ad\nity conferred by \u00a7 1 o f Executive Order No. 12079 is sufficient to meet\nyour concerns.\n\n                               I. Background\n\n   You raise issues concerning the interrelationship of two separate but\nrelated pieces o f legislation and the orders issued thereunder. The perti\u00ad\nnent portions o f the separate enactments relate both to the development of\npublic airports and to Federal assistance to such projects. The first enact\u00ad\nment, the Federal Airport Act o f 1946, 60 Stat. 170 (hereinafter referred to\nas the 1946 Act), required that, as a condition o f receiving Federal grants,\nState and local public agencies submit airport development project appli\u00ad\ncations to the A dm inistrator o f the Federal Aviation Adm inistration. \u00a7 9(a),\n60 Stat. 174. The Adm inistrator, before entering into any grant agreement,\nwas required to approve the project application. Numerous conditions\nwere to be met before approval could be given; one condition was that\n     No project shall be approved by the Adm inistrator with respect to\n     any airport unless a public agency holds good title, satisfactory\n     to the Adm inistrator, to the landing area o f such airport or the\n\n                                      95\n\f     site therefor, or gives assurance satisfactory to the Adm inistrator\n     that such title will be acquired. [Section 9(d), 60 Stat. 175.]\nAnother provision o f the same Act provided for the conveyance o f Federal\nlands when the Adm inistrator determined that this was \u201c reasonably neces\u00ad\nsary for carrying out a project\u201d under the Act. \u00a7 16(a), 60 Stat. 179. The\nprocedure for carrying out such a conveyance was as follows:\n     Upon receipt o f a request from the Adm inistrator under this sec\u00ad\n     tion, the head o f the departm ent or agency having control o f the\n     lands in question shall determine whether the requested convey\u00ad\n     ance is inconsistent with the needs o f the departm ent or agency,\n     and shall notify the A dm inistrator o f his determ ination within a\n     period o f four m onths after receipt o f the Adm inistrator\u2019s re\u00ad\n     quest. If such departm ent or agency head determines that the re\u00ad\n     quested conveyance is not inconsistent with the needs o f that\n     departm ent or agency, such departm ent or agency head is hereby\n     authorized and directed, with the approval o f the President and\n     the A ttorney General o f the United States, and without any ex\u00ad\n     pense to the United States, to perform any acts and to execute\n     any instruments necessary to make the conveyance requested;\n     but each such conveyance shall be made on the condition that the\n     property interest conveyed shall automatically revert to the\n     United States in the event that the lands in question are not\n     developed, or cease to be used, for airport purposes. [Section\n     16(b), 60 Stat. 179.]\nIn Executive Order No. 10536 o f June 9, 1954, the President authorized\nthe heads o f departm ents and agencies to execute conveyances under this\nprovision without the approval o f the President.\n   The second pertinent piece o f legislation, the Airport and Airway Devel\u00ad\nopm ent Act o f 1970, Pub. L. No. 91-258, 84 Stat. 219 (hereinafter re\u00ad\nferred to as the 1970 Act), repealed the 1946 Act, but it also enacted provi\u00ad\nsions which, to a great extent, adhered to that A ct\u2019s approach. As a condi\u00ad\ntion o f receiving Federal grants, public agencies once again had to obtain\napproval o f project applications for airport development. 49 U.S.C.\n\u00a7\u00a7 1716(a), 1719. The conditions o f approval were largely the same as in\nthe 1946 Act, including that o f good title, 49 U .S.C . \u00a7 1716(c), but stricter\nenvironmental standards were to be applied. See 49 U .S.C . \u00a7 1716(c)(4),\n(d) and (e). A provision similar to that o f the 1946 Act was made for con\u00ad\nveyances o f Federal lands, except that certain parklands were exempted.\n49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1723. In Executive O rder No. 12079, 3 CFR 224 (1979), the\nPresident authorized the conveyances to be executed without his approval.\n   The repeal o f the 1946 Act soon gave rise to the question whether, where\ngrant agreements had been finalized under the 1946 Act, conveyances of\nFederal land pursuant to those agreements might still be made and ap\u00ad\nproved under the authority o f the 1946 Act. In our opinion o f January 19,\n1971, this Office answered the question affirmatively. The opinion relied\non \u00a7 52(c) o f the 1970 Act, 84 Stat. 219, 236, which explicitly continued in\n\n                                      96\n\feffect \u201c all orders, determ inations, rules, regulations, permits, contracts,\ncertificates, licenses, grants, rights and privileges\u201d which had taken effect\nunder the 1946 Act. The opinion also reasoned that, since a conveyance of\nland was \u201c inextricably bound up with the grant agreem ent,\u201d Congress\nmust have intended that the savings clause permitted conveyancing in ac\u00ad\ncordance with the 1946 Act.\n   Under this interpretation, conveyances continued to be made under the\n1946 Act by reason o f Executive Order No. 10536, and were made without\nthe approval o f the President. Despite the significant lapse o f time since\nthe repeal o f the 1946 Act, it is our understanding that a num ber o f con\u00ad\nveyances, which could be approved without Presidential approval under\nExecutive Order No. 10536 and our previous opinion, have yet to be\nmade. However, since Executive Order No. 10536 has been revoked by Ex\u00ad\necutive Order No. 12079, the question is whether a new authorization must\nbe obtained in order to execute these conveyances without the approval o f\nthe President. As noted above, we do not believe this to be the case.\n\n                               II. Discussion\n\n  Section 23 o f the 1970 Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1723, provides as follows:\n     (a) Requests for use.\n        Subject to the provisions o f subsection (c) o f this section,\n    whenever the Secretary determines that use o f any lands owned\n    or controlled by the United States is reasonably necessary for\n    carrying out a project for airport development under this part,\n     [part II], or for the operation o f any public airport, including\n    lands reasonably necessary to meet future development o f an air\u00ad\n    port in accordance with the national airport system plan, he shall\n    file with the head o f the departm ent or agency having control of\n    the lands a request that the necessary property interests therein\n    be conveyed to the public agency sponsoring the project in ques\u00ad\n    tion or owning or controlling the airport. The property interest\n    may consist o f the title to, or any other interest in, land or any\n    easement through or other interest in airspace.\n    (b) Execution o f conveyances.\n       Upon receipt o f a request from the Secretary under this sec\u00ad\n    tion, the head o f the departm ent or agency having control o f the\n    lands in question shall determine whether the requested convey\u00ad\n    ance is inconsistent with the needs o f the departm ent or agency,\n    and shall notify the Secretary o f his determ ination within a\n    period o f four m onths after receipt o f the Secretary\u2019s request. If\n    the departm ent or agency head determines that the requested\n    conveyance is not inconsistent with the needs o f that departm ent\n    or agency, the departm ent or agency head is hereby authorized\n    and directed, with the approval o f the President and the\n    Attorney General o f the United States, and without any expense\n    to the United States, to perform any acts and to execute any\n\n                                     97\n\f      instruments necessary to make the conveyance requested. A con\u00ad\n      veyance may be made only on the condition that, at the option of\n      the Secretary, the property interest conveyed shall revert to the\n      United States in the event that the lands in question are not\n      developed for airport purposes or used in a m anner consistent\n      with the terms o f the conveyance. If only a part o f the property\n      interest conveyed is not developed for airport purposes, or used\n      in a m anner consistent with the terms o f the conveyance, only\n      that particular part shall at the option o f the Secretary, revert to\n      the United States.\n      (c)   Exemptions o f certain lands.\n         Unless otherwise specifically provided by law, the provisions\n      o f subsections (a) and (b) o f this section shall not apply with\n      respect to lands owned or controlled by the United States within\n      any national park, national m onum ent, national recreation area,\n      or similar area under the adm inistration o f the National Park\n      Service; within any unit o f the National Wildlife Refuge System\n      or similar area under the jurisdiction o f the Bureau o f Sport\n      Fisheries and Wildlife; or within any national forest or Indian\n      reservation.\nExcept for the language \u201c under this p art\u201d in subsection (a), there is noth\u00ad\ning in the section precluding its use in situations involving projects for air\u00ad\nport development conducted under the authority o f the 1946 Act. Rather,\nthe language o f the section is generally broad enough to encompass con\u00ad\nveyances contem plated in grants under the 1946 Act.\n   O f course, the phrase \u201c under this part\u201d could be read to restrict the ap\u00ad\nplication o f \u00a7 23 to those airport development projects conducted under\nthe authority o f part II o f the 1970 Act. We do not believe, however, that\nthe phrase was meant to preclude the use o f \u00a7 23 in situations involving\ngrants under the 1946 Act. Since \u00a7 23 largely restates the analogous provi\u00ad\nsion o f the 1946 Act, Congress obviously wished to continue that A ct\u2019s\npurpose o f allowing Federal lands to be conveyed for carrying out airport\nprojects. This purpose would hardly be served by reading the language\n\u201c under this part\u201d to preclude the use o f \u00a7 23 in projects conducted under\nthe authority o f the 1946 Act. Rather, in light o f Congress\u2019 purpose in en\u00ad\nacting \u00a7 23, and because part II o f the 1970 Act is largely a reenactment of\nthe 1946 Act, see H. Rept. 601, 91st Cong., 1st sess. 12-13 (1969), a more\nreasonable assessment o f Congress\u2019 intent would be to interpret the term\n\u201c under this part\u201d as including projects undertaken under the 1946 A c t.1\n\n\n\n   1 Indeed, the language \u201c under this p a rt\u201d essentially tracks the language \u201c under this A ct\u201d\nin the analogous provision o f the 1946 A ct. This would suggest that it was not intended to\nrestrict \u00a7 23 with respect to the 1946 Act, but rather was simply a continuation o f the policy\no f the 1946 Act to allow Federal conveyances only for purposes o f aiding airport develop\u00ad\nment projects.\n\n                                              98\n\f   Another aspect o f the statute supports our conclusion. As noted above,\n \u00a7 52 o f the 1970 Act provides that grants in effect at the time of the effec\u00ad\ntive date of the Act were to continue in effect. See 49 U .S.C . \u00a7 1701 note.\nMoreover, as we explained in our January 19, 1971 opinion, grant agree\u00ad\n ments were inextricably bound up with conveyances o f Federal land. We\ncannot believe that Congress would, on the one hand; act to preserve\ngrants under the 1946 Act that were dependent on such conveyances and,\non the other hand, restrict \u00a7 23 to preclude conveyances with respect to\nthese grants. Rather, since Congress wished to preserve existing grants, a\nmore likely interpretation o f \u00a7 23 would be that its authority is available to\neffectuate those grants.2\n   The legislative history o f the 1970 Act supports this view. One com \u00ad\nmittee report states that land may be conveyed under \u00a7 23 \u201c for the pur\u00ad\npose of carrying out projects for airport developm ent.\u201d H. Rept. 601, 91st\nCong., 1st sess. 15 (1969). See also H. Rept. 1074, 91st Cong., 2d sess. 43\n(1970). This general statement o f intent would appear to encompass p ro j\u00ad\nects conducted not only under the 1970 Act, but also under the 1946 Act.\nIn addition, the Conference Report states that \u00a7 23 \u201c continues, with\nminor modifications, the policy contained in existing law.\u201d H. Rept. 1074,\n91st Cong., 2d sess. 44 (1970). Since the existing law had allowed for\nconveyances to aid projects under the 1946 Act, this statement would in\u00ad\ndicate Congress\u2019 intent to allow for the same result to occur under \u00a7 23.\n   We thus conclude that, where grant agreements had been finalized\nunder the 1946 Act, conveyances o f land may be made pursuant to those\nagreements under the authority conferred by \u00a7 23 o f the 1970 Act. By\nreason o f Executive Order No. 12079, such conveyances may be made\nwithout Presidential approval: There is thus no need to initiate action for-\nreinstatement o f the authority, contained in the revoked Executive Order\nNo. 10536, in order to convey Federal lands without Presidential approval\nunder the 1946 Act.\n   The fear has been expressed that, if conveyances are made under \u00a7 23 o f\nthe 1970 Act, other requirements o f that Act would also have to be met.\nAs we have already noted, however, Congress in the 1970 Act continued in\nforce those grants under the 1946 Act that existed on the effective date o f\nthe 1970 Act. Even though the provisions o f the 1970 Act may impose ad\u00ad\nditional or different requirements on grants, it seems clear to us that those\nprovisions do not apply to grants finalized before the 1970 Act became ef\u00ad\nfective. Moreover, we see no reason for \u00a7 23 to be deemed inapplicable to\n1946 Act grants by requirements which, as Congress expressly provided,\n\n\n   2 We recognize that, in our January 19, 1971 opinion, we concluded that such conveyances\ncould go forward under the authority o f the 1946 Act. T hat opinion, however, did not deal\nwith the availability o f \u00a7 23 o f the 1970 Act; rather, it dealt only with the question whether\nconveyances could be made under the revoked 1946 Act. While we have no occasion to ques\u00ad\ntion our prevous opinion's conclusion, we believe it more appropriate to proceed under the\nauthority o f \u00a7 23\u2014which we believe to be applicable to projects under the 1946 A ct\u2014 rather\nthan under a provision in a repealed statute.\n\n                                             99\n\fwere not to apply to such grants. We have found nothing in \u00a7 23 or its\nlegislative history to suggest a contrary conclusion; rather, on the basis of\no ur previous discussion, we think that the language and the legislative\nhistory o f \u00a7 23 indicate that Congress intended \u00a7 23 to permit conveyances\npursuant to those grant agreements entered into under the 1946 Act.\n\n                                       L eon U lman\n                           D eputy Assistant A ttorney General\n                                                 Office o f Legal Counsel\n\n\n\n\n                                    100\n\f"
