    "text": "The removal of sulfur contaminants, specifically H2S, from wastewater streams using aqueous salt streams is known. Likewise, the removal of H2S from hydrocarbon containing gas streams is known. However, such known processes for treating gas streams do not directly produce useful chemicals. Accordingly, there is a need to develop economical processes that can selectively scrub and remove H2S from industrial gas streams at ambient temperatures and at the same time produce a useful liquid product. These and other advantages will become evident from the following more detailed description of the present disclosure."
