I've also found this documented issue: https://github.com/docker/machine/issues/4342 but it is not the same issue since I do not have VMware PowerCLI installed. The issue was closed with a push to the repo and is supposedly fixed in 0.14.0-rc1, build e918c74 so I tried it anyways. After replacing my docker-machine.exe, I'm still getting the error and still getting the error even if I reinstall Docker for Windows.\nFor some more background, this error starting happening after a reinstall because my Docker install had an error: https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/1691, however, I'm not longer getting that issue after reinstalling.\n\nA:\n\nFor those who struggle with this issue in Windows, Follow the instruction here\n\nA:\n\nWhen creating a Hyper-v VM using docker-machine on win10, an error was returned\"Error with pre-create check: \"Hyper-V PowerShell Module is not available\"\u3002\nThe solution is very simple. The reason is the version of the docker-machine program. Replace it with v0.13.0. The detailed operation is as follows:\n\nDownload the 0.13.0 version of the docker-machine command. Click to download: 32-bit system or 64-bit system\nAfter the download is complete, rename and replace the \" docker-machine.exe \" file in the \" C:\\Program Files\\Docker\\Docker\\resources\\bin\" directory.
