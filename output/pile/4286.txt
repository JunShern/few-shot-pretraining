    "text": "Gary Dauberman has moved up in James Wan\u2019s crew. He\u2019s written the three Annabelle movies and makes his directorial debut on Annabelle Comes Home. He also produced The Curse of La Llorona and wrote and produced The Nun. He\u2019s also co-created DC Universe\u2019s new Swamp Thing streaming series, which Wan produced via his Atomic Monster production company.\n\nDauberman spoke with /Film by phone about Swamp Thing this week. He\u2019s about to make the press rounds again next month for Annabelle Comes Home and he also gave us updates on Salem\u2019s Lot, It: Chapter 2, the Train to Busan remake, Annabelle Comes Home and Are You Afraid Of the Dark. Swamp Thing premieres today on DC Universe.\n\nDid you come to Swamp Thing more through James Wan than through the comics?\n\nNo, I came to Swamp Thing through Alan Moore and Bernie Wrightson. Bernie Wrightson has long been one of my heroes. I knew his artwork and I knew Swamp Thing from him and then Alan Moore\u2019s iconic run on that comic back in the \u201880s that I did discover later. I wasn\u2019t reading it as it was coming out but it was just an eye-opening experience reading that. It felt so different from all the other comics I was reading at the time. Being able to revisit those comics for the show, they still feel so different and fresh from anything they put out there still. It was great that they still hold up and still invoke the proper creepiness and atmosphere as when I read it for the first time. For the show, when I found out that James was doing Swamp Thing, I did whatever I could to be involved.\n\nWere you privy to DC Universe\u2019s series Titans and Doom Patrol while you were developing Swamp Thing?\n\nNo. Titans had not come out yet while we were writing the pilot so it came out while we were making the show. Those, although I couldn\u2019t wait to see them, they didn\u2019t really inform our process in any way making the show.\n\nHad you already researched the swamp for your movie Swamp Devil?\n\n[Laughs] Oh man, yeah. I wrote that in one week way back when. I have not seen any of those movies but I enjoyed working on those scripts. That\u2019s funny you bring that up.\n\nTo be fair, I haven\u2019t seen it either. I just saw that you wrote another swamp movie.\n\nIt was one of those made for Syfy movies very early on when they were doing it weekly. I think it was every Saturday night or something. Those movies taught me a lot. They would say, \u201cWe have a total, we have a location, we have a cast. We need a script. Can you write something very quickly?\u201d They really sharpened my skills in terms of working towards a deadline and working towards knowing that we\u2019re going into production. That really helped me a lot later on when we were working on TV and they need a script quickly because they\u2019re working towards production. It helped to build that muscle.\n\nHow much real science is in Swamp Thing?\n\nLook, I\u2019m not a scientist so you could make up anything, I\u2019d be like, \u201cYeah, that sounds correct.\u201d I know through production we work very closely with consultants trying to make the events that happen in the series to be as plausible as possible and ground it. I think that\u2019s been achieved.\n\nDoes anything go on DC Universe streaming as far as language and violence? I don\u2019t know if sexuality would be an issue with Swamp Thing.\n\nYeah, that was one of our first questions was, \u201cWhat can we get away with?\u201d And they said, \u201cWhatever you want, really.\u201d which was super freeing. It allowed us not to have to write around anything that normally you\u2019d have to on network. We could just barrel straight through and if we wanted to get graphic, we could get graphic. We have a lot of body horror and gore and violence in this TV series so we were able to embrace it all. It was a very \u201canything goes\u201d mentality.\n\nSo are the roots ripping people in half only the beginning?\n\nThat is only the beginning, literally and figuratively. It\u2019s one of the first things, especially when you read the comics and all that stuff. Those things are a lot of fun to write. That\u2019s one of the cool things about the swamp, right? There\u2019s a very kitchen sink aspect to the swamp. Because of its origins, we\u2019re able to explore and hit on other subgenres of horror. If we wanted to tell a haunted house supernatural beat, we felt we could get away with it. If we want to do something a little bit more body horror, we could do that. We certainly have psychological horror aspects of the show. Whatever dark corner we wanted to shine a light on we were able to do that just by the very nature of the nature of the swamp.\n\nIs Swamp Thing a beauty and the beast story?\n\nIt\u2019s definitely something we lean into, we played around with. The cool thing about the Swamp Thing is it\u2019s an exploration of identity. There\u2019s an existential crisis happening for Alec Holland, for Abby Arcane, for a lot of the characters in the town. Beauty and the beast certainly is an aspect but it\u2019s also Alec Holland, exploring who he\u2019s become, who he is and what\u2019s the swamp becoming. So while we have the beauty and the beast component, it\u2019s only one part of the whole.\n\nWe haven\u2019t seen the last of Andy Bean, right?\n\nOh man, I hope not but I\u2019ll save that for some reveals. Having worked with him on It: Chapter 2, and I\u2019d seen his early audition for Stanley, this guy brings such an energy to everything he does. He\u2019s so watchable we were also really cheerleaders for him to play Alec Holland because he brings such a level of engagement to all his performances. It\u2019s really a treat watching him.\n\nYou lost three episodes at the end of the season. Did that change the arc of the first season?\n\nNo, we knew what we were building towards and we were getting there. We felt we could accomplish that in 10 episodes so it kind of worked out. We were able to land where we wanted to land.\n\nAre there any things from those back three you could bring back in a second season?\n\nYes but I won\u2019t speak specifically to those because it would spoil this season.\n\nAs a fan of Moore and Wrightson, what were the elements you just had to get into Swamp Thing?\n\nWe really like the southern Gothic feel. Mark and I talked a lot about that. We talked about the panels, Bernie and Alan, really dripped with this melodrama and really this atmosphere. His sense of dread we really liked. We knew we wanted to get some of the headier ideas in there as well because that\u2019s what\u2019s so great about the comic. It explored and asked big questions of things. We were able to do that with the show as well, ask big questions. What makes a man? What makes a monster? It was those kind of elements we wanted to bring to the show. The spirit of the comic was so different from a lot of the stuff that was out there that first and foremost with the show, we wanted to do that as well. We wanted to make this different from a lot of the stuff out there. I think we really succeeded in that regard.\n\nWas North Carolina southern enough to capture the gothic vibe?\n\nOh yeah. The sets down there were amazing, and the crew and cast really drilled down on that. It was great to shoot there.\n\nThey just announced you\u2019re doing Salem\u2019s Lot. They\u2019ve done that as a TV miniseries twice but never as a film before. Did you have a unique way into Salem\u2019s Lot as a feature film?\n\nI did have a unique way into it but again, I think the book in itself is unique. Certainly now, I haven\u2019t seen a scary vampire movie in a long, long time and I\u2019d really love to tackle that. It\u2019s one of my favorite books. It\u2019s one of my favorite Stephen King books. We felt it should have the cinematic treatment that we gave It. It was a miniseries as well. The experience of bringing that to the big screen was such a joy that I was so happy we will have the opportunity to do that for Salem\u2019s Lot.\n\nJames Wan has said he won\u2019t produce Train to Busan unless they find a really good reason to do an American remake. Have you gotten close to finding a good reason?\n\nYes. I won\u2019t get more into that but that\u2019s one of those movies that\u2019s so f***ing great, it\u2019s so well done, you don\u2019t want to do anything that\u2019s going to be less than. I think we\u2019re certainly getting there. It feels like there\u2019s a reason to make the American version without ruining the experience of the original.\n\nNow we\u2019ve seen the trailer to It: Chapter 2 and we\u2019re happy the kids are still involved. Could you estimate what proportion of the movie the kids are in? Maybe 10% of it?\n\nNo, I don\u2019t want to say that. I don\u2019t want to put a number on it.\n\nEveryone, when they saw Sophia Lillis, said Jessica Chastain should play adult Bev. How big a coup was it to get her?\n\nI always had my fingers crossed because I knew the Muschiettis had their relationship with Jessica. It was whispered about but I\u2019m such a fan of hers. While they know her, I only knew her seeing her on the big screen so you\u2019re like really? Could this really happen? I\u2019m sitting there as a fan and then when it really happens you\u2019re just like \u201cHoly sh*t.\u201d It\u2019s elevated immediately with her signing on.\n\nDo you have any other Stephen King books on your wish list?\n\nYeah, I have so many favorites. Salem\u2019s Lot is the only thing that\u2019s in front of me right now that I want to work on. It\u2019s been fun exploring the dark corners of that town. I\u2019m kind of a one track mind. I don\u2019t plot too far ahead and I\u2019m overjoyed I get to work on Salem\u2019s Lot so right now that\u2019s all there is for me. There\u2019s a number of stuff in the works that I\u2019m not a part of that I\u2019m very excited to see when they eventually come out.\n\nHas Are You Afraid of the Dark shot yet?\n\nNo, that actually hasn\u2019t shot yet. That\u2019s one of those things I\u2019m no longer a part of. I just had a different vision to make it and thought it best to part ways.\n\nThat happens. It\u2019s good to get that on record.\n\nFor sure. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s out there. It\u2019s unfortunate but as you said, that\u2019s sometimes how it goes.\n\nAnnabelle Comes Home is the first Annabelle movie that\u2019s not a prequel. Was that a different thing?\n\nYes, it is the first Annabelle movie that\u2019s not a prequel and it was a different thing. It presented its own sort of challenges because you\u2019re locked into everything post Warrens, right? You have The Conjuring 1, Conjuring 2, all those things that have happened. You can\u2019t and don\u2019t want to mess with any of that. You want to make sure you don\u2019t step on any toes mythology-wise. I was excited to dig in further on the Judy Warren character.\n\nAre Ed and Lorraine more than just cameos in it?\n\nYeah, they\u2019re definitely part of the story. They definitely influence the story.\n\nAny talks of more Nun movies?\n\nThat I can\u2019t speak to. It\u2019s always an ongoing conversation just because we love talking about the universe. Wouldn\u2019t it be cool if we did this? Wouldn\u2019t it be cool if we did that? There\u2019s a lot of talk about everything, evolving this universe."
