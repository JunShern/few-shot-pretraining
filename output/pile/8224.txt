    "text": "There\u2019s a high-bandwidth cable connecting that iPad or iPhone to your Mac. And yet \u2026 and yet, until recently, music apps treated that very connection as an impossible-to-cross canyon.\n\nNo more.\n\nWe already took a look at midimux, a tool that makes everything that speaks MIDI on an iOS gadget available to your Mac, and visa versa. That\u2019s already cool. You can use a keyboard controller plugged into your Mac to play a soft synth on your iPad. You can sequence an instrument on your computer from an iPad step sequencer, with touch control. Hardware and desktop software and apps all work. This also means controller apps no longer need to use fidgety wireless connections. So long as they support MIDI, you can use a cable. (That\u2019s important, as I\u2019ve found ad-hoc networking has recently gotten even more unreliable \u2013 to use OSC, I\u2019ve taken to carrying around a standalone wifi router.)\n\nBut it\u2019s when you put MIDI together with audio that things get really interesting. In an exclusive first look, CDM gets the scoop on a video demo showing how it all works. (Okay, it\u2019s an exclusive first look because I spent yesterday nagging the developers to shoot it and wouldn\u2019t leave them alone until it was done. You\u2019re welcome. And, uh \u2014 sorry, guys.)\n\nWith audiomux, you can pipe sound digitally in both directions between the Mac and iOS, with no loss in fidelity. That means you can finally take some interesting bits you\u2019re working on in an iPad drum machine or synth or soundmaker and immediately pipe them into a session in your DAW \u2013 no futzing about with extra cables and interfaces. And you can go the other direction, too, making an iPad or iPhone a powerful mobile recording device for sampling or taking audio on the go or recording live or DJ sets.\n\nNina Kraviz appears in a film from vinyl store The Record Loft. It\u2019s short, but she\u2019s strikingly economical and insightful in talking about what it means to mix records, find records, and make records.\n\nThe Siberian-born PhD dental doctor-turned-DJ/producer is especially noteworthy at the beginning of 2015. Last month, she helmed edition number 50 of the legendary DJ-Kicks series \u2013 the gold standard of what a mix should be.\n\nWhat\u2019s nice about the interview is how quickly Kraviz gets to the emotional essence of all the dimensions of her work. Feeling, and capturing a moment, is at the heart of how she puts together a mix and digs for albums and sings and plays synths. I think people who haven\u2019t gotten to explore the range of her work might not fully appreciate how far afield she can go.\n\nIn all three categories of what she says, it\u2019s also clear what can be special in an age of identical mechanical reproduction. Mixes are not sterile affairs to be made perfectly in the home; they\u2019re about connecting with people, live. Finding music is not about algorithms and SoundCloud listener counts and Facebook likes; it\u2019s about the surprise of an unordered box in a second-hand record shop. And even vocals and synths can be about imperfection and real-time accident. Now, I\u2019m personally partial to the unexpected pathways you can find online and perfectly at home with digital tools and distribution, but I think the emotional reality of what she\u2019s suggesting here becomes even more important to underline.\n\nThat sense of rediscovering the emotional core seems essential, too, in techno, which especially given its raw commercial success can endanger itself in becoming cold and unfeeling. This is a roadmap, in other words, on how it can keep its soul.\n\nThe Knuckle Visualizer is the work of a Korean animation house. It doesn\u2019t actually produce sound. The only functioning part of the hardware you see here is a USB cable that powers an LED lamp. But there are fascinating ideas here. And, actually, you could build this. We can often get stuck in our repetitive music world and forget what\u2019s possible. So let\u2019s watch the animators run wild with our sounds.\n\nRubber ducks and toy nesting dolls and and jelly beans make up the controls. Buchla-styled colored patch cords are actually organized according to sound.\n\nAnd not only is this made-up synthesizer/sequencer itself animated, but whimsical dances of shapes and geometry add still more visual accompaniment to the sound.\n\nSomewhere apart from the general purpose computer, the standalone electronic instrument, the racks of modulars, there is Kyma. For nearly a quarter century, this boutique digital instrument has opened up sonic realms to a scattered illuminati of artists. And this week, it hit a new milestone, with functionality and resources intended to make sound exploration still broader and more accessible.\n\nThree years in development, Kyma 7 is here.\n\nThe buzz around modular often comes back to the same refrain: modular is cool because it\u2019s open ended. That rat\u2019s nest of cables, modular advocates say, represent freedom. No argument from me, but Kyma can fairly make a similar claim, backed by a somewhat obscenely deep set of sound tools you can patch together. Kyma\u2019s not cheap by computer standards, and not expensive by analog modular standards. A mid-range system runs about four grand US$, with a \u201clab\u201d system still just shy of three. That\u2019s nothing to sneeze at, given that you can download Pure Data for nothing and load it onto a $300 laptop, and still get a deep graphical digital environment. But for its followers, Kyma represents an investment in possibility \u2013 and sound quality.\n\nKyma, like the mountain in the image for Kyma 7, is something I largely admire from afar. But admire, I do \u2013 and Kyma 7 has some nice things in it.\n\nLook closely, and you see an environment that has no direct comparison. Whether or not you want to live there, getting a look at Kyma is like glimpsing a far-off tropical island: it\u2019s a world unto itself.\n\nSo, the thing about Amsterdam\u2019s Paradiso is, there are balconies. And the thing about being in a balcony above Kraftwerk is, their once-secret live rig for their 3D show is now fully exposed.\n\nThe next question: what\u2019s happening?\n\nI have been squinting at this live video for some time, and I\u2019m not sure. Some things are obvious: definitely MK I Maschine drum machine controllers from Native Instruments, definitely a MIDI keyboard for the odd solo, fairly certain I also spot a Novation ReMOTE ZeRO SL controller (encoders and faders and red lights) and the display for Steinberg\u2019s Cubase which appears to hold backing tracks.\n\nSomeone is reading \u2026 well, something. It appears to be an iPad UI, maybe, pre-iOS 7. It involves text. Is it an email?\n\nWhat\u2019s happening musically and extra-musically here? I could say more, but I think it\u2019s time to crowd-source CDM Nation\u2019s incredible eagle eyes and superior technical knowledge. Let us know what you think (I\u2019m also getting some feedback via social media), and perhaps we can arrive at a final conclusion. Continue reading \u00bb\n\nIt costs just a hundred bucks. It\u2019s tiny, in a metal case with ultra-compact knobs and light-up buttons for hands-on control. And with MIDI, USB, CV, and even dedicated littleBits ins and outs, there\u2019s a reason I described the announcement of KORG\u2019s new SQ-1 sequencer as a sequencer that does everything.\n\nBut doing everything in such a little box is a tall order. And the SQ-1 packs in so much, it\u2019s not obvious what its capabilities can be. One one hand, there are some powerful features that you might completely miss (like MIDI-to-CV capabilities). On the other, it has some limitations you should know about, as well. In trying to be all things to all gear in the smallest package possible, it has to make some sacrifices \u2013 so it\u2019s better at some jobs than others.\n\nI\u2019ve gotten my hands on one and begun to use it (thanks to a studio neighbor who brought one back from Japan). And I\u2019ve been in touch with KORG\u2019s engineers in Japan to clarify its capabilities. So, let\u2019s take a detailed look. Continue reading \u00bb\n\nAnd, let\u2019s take a moment to have a laugh at the expense of EDM DJs \u2013 and, around that moment where you get some bloodied laptop fingers, ourselves.\n\nYouTube Comedy purveyors Nacho Punch take on Oscar-winning Whiplash \u2013 a film about a jazz drummer \u2013 with a DJ rendition set in a made-up \u201cSkrillex Academy.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ll want to have the original fresh in mind first, so see the original above, then the parody below.\n\nAnd then\u2026 well, here I was going to make some snarky comment or some sort of clever insight, or perhaps broaden the comedy to some deeper reflection on the meaning of\u2026\n\nWho am I kidding? Now I\u2019m probably just going to spend the rest of tonight watching the rest of these YouTube videos, instead of the usual wundergroundmusic.com stories. Yeah, thanks for that. I should really be getting on a new mix in Traktor. Why don\u2019t you see glow sticks any more, anyway? I \u2026 lost my train of thought. Crossfade."
