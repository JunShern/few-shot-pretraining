    "text": "Yesterday I presented the first half of my review of Scott Creighton\u2019s new book The Great Pyramid Hoax (Bear & Company, 2017), a book that takes a chapter from his previous 2015 book The Secret Chamber of Osiris and expands it to ten times its original size. Stripped of context and purpose, this inflated chapter becomes mostly unreadable as a book, an incomplete indictment of the \u201cquarry marks\u201d in the relieving chambers of the Great Pyramid that Creighton never bothers to give much in terms of purpose. Aside from a few vague assurances that discrediting these marks would leave the Great Pyramid\u2019s builder uncertain, he never uses that assertion to build a case for anything, nor does he suggest, as he did in his previous book, that the Pyramid is anything but an Old Kingdom construction. If one were not already a reader of Scott Creighton\u2019s books, I imagine this now volume would seem dry and pointless.\n\nAs we move in to the back two-thirds of the book, Creighton attempts to marshal evidence to support the tentative hypothesis that he proposed in the first section of the book. It remains unconvincing. One chapter argues that the three red splotches photographed by Rudolph Gantenbrink\u2019s robot at the top of one of the Queen\u2019s Chamber \u201cair\u201d shafts in 1993 are orthographically dissimilar to the quarry marks in the Kings\u2019 Chamber relieving chamber, thus indicating that the relieving chamber marks were made later. There are too many problems to count here: (a) The marks in the air shaft have only tentatively been identified and are not certain, so orthography can\u2019t be determined. (b) Since we don\u2019t know what the characters were, we can\u2019t conclude that the project \u201crequired\u201d the same writing style on every stone for \u201cefficiency.\u201d Etc. etc.\n\nNext, Creighton attempts to show that Vyse was lying about having discovered quarry marks showing Khufu\u2019s name. His argument is again circumstantial: Vyse\u2019s journal of March 30, 1837 records his initial impressions: \u201cIn Wellington\u2019s chamber, there are marks in the area of the stones like quarry marks of red paint, also the figure of a bird near them, but nothing like hieroglyphics.\u201d Creighton takes this to mean that the cartouches were not present, not that Vyse reconsidered his opinion after more careful viewing and analysis.\n\nFollowing this, he introduces into evidence a confusing bit of hearsay. After Zecharia Sitchin accused Vyse of forgery, a man named Walter M. Allen of Pittsburgh claimed in 1983 that his elderly relatives had told him that his great-grandfather, Humphries Brewer, was one of Vyse\u2019s companions and believed that some of the \u201cfaint\u201d quarry marks had been repainted and \u201csome were new.\u201d This testimony is suspect since it is both third-hand (Allen\u2019s account of elderly people\u2019s memories of something someone might once have said decades after the fact about an event from more than a century earlier) and conveniently timed after Sitchin created a controversy. While Allen made his claims verbally in 1983, a written version was not published until Sitchin himself did so in 2007, after Allen was conveniently dead. At that time, Sitchin presented a log book recording Allen\u2019s conversations with his elderly relatives. Allen claimed that these notes were written in 1954, which even if true would not make the claims within them true, if for no other reason than for the same reasons Creighton attributes to Vyse: potential motivation to support some preexisting idea at odds with the facts. Indeed, the suggestion that the marks were too faint to clearly see actually argues against Creighton\u2019s claim that Vyse could not possibly have overlooked the marks on his first survey of the relieving chambers.\n\nBrewer\u2019s name does not appear in Vyse\u2019s records, and Creighton explains that this is because Vyse tried to expunge any record of him to hide the forgery. At the same time, he says that he might have found Brewer\u2019s name in photographs of Vyse\u2019s notebooks, but he said that it was impossible to tell because of Vyse\u2019s bad handwriting. He declined to cite the page or provide a copy of the relevant words to let readers judge for themselves, despite having provided the same evidence for other excerpts of the journals. He says only that the name appears in the \u201crelevant\u201d section of the 600+ page journal. One might ask why he declined to share proof, but I fear the answer is probably clear.\n\nCreighton devotes enormous space to trying to prove that Allen\u2019s notes are not a forgery\u2014but a forgery of what? They are secondhand recollections of what someone supposedly had read in now-lost papers ages ago. Even so, Creighton argues that the notes must be correct because they contain details a forger would not have readily known: the existence of Prussia (really?), the geographical extent of the Austrian Empire (has he seen a map?), and the fact that a certain Mr. Raven was part of the discussion of the quarry marks. Not to put too fine a point on it, but if the text were a forgery, it could have been forged from entries for May 1837 in Vyse\u2019s book Operations Carried on at the Great Pyramid, where Vyse states that Raven was left alone at the pyramid while he was away, between the time of the discovery of the quarry marks in one chamber (entry for May 9) and when Vyse\u2019s team signed a statement attesting to the accuracy of the copies made from them (entry for May 19). Thus a forger might have thought to finger him as fabricating some of them, even if the chronology doesn\u2019t work out perfectly for the uppermost chamber. This isn\u2019t to say the text is a forgery, only that Creighton\u2019s argument for their authenticity doesn\u2019t follow absolutely from the written evidence. If the text is not a forgery, it still only proves that Brewer suspected Raven of manipulating the quarry marks while Vyse was away.\n\nHis next piece of evidence is the fact that one of Vyse\u2019s assistants, the man who drew copies of the marks, signed two of twenty-four drawings on the wrong side, thus \u201cproving\u201d that they were made before the quarry marks were painted onto the wall in a different and/or incorrect direction. He claims that an analysis of photographs of the paint suggest that the signs were written left-to-right and while the blocks were upright, in contravention of Egyptological consensus, a consensus he doesn\u2019t seem to be able to cite or discuss with sources outside other fringe books\u2019 summaries. Creighton, who likes to cite the Graham Hancock website forum, discussed these claims on the board in 2014 and received extensive criticism from Martin Stower, which made no impression on him.\n\nWeirdly, the book then returns to repeat the same material from earlier about Vyse\u2019s journal\u2014because he is lightly rewriting a chapter from his last book, mostly point for point\u2014and Creighton makes it sound like it was the result of careful sleuthing that he found the document. It shouldn\u2019t have taken much effort. It\u2019s held in a museum and listed online in its holdings. It\u2019s not hiding. In the journal, Creighton finds that Vyse made several attempts at copying the cartouches of Khufu, each time getting some of the details wrong until he finally made a correct copy. Creighton instead reads this as progressive efforts to draft a fake cartouche to forge, with the final details\u2014specifically three horizontal lines in the circle within the cartouche\u2014hastily added at the end to \u201cfix\u201d the spelling of Khufu due to late-breaking discoveries elsewhere at Giza that month.\n\nCreighton, recapping his last book without mentioning the fact, says that the following lines from the journal prove that Vyse ordered his henchman to fabricate Khufu\u2019s cartouche, and he claims it as a new discovery despite having published the same text in his 2015 book:\n\nThe chamber was 39 long, by 19.10 broad: as it was within \u201cCampbell\u2019s Chamber May 27, 1837.\u201d \u201cFor Raven & Hill.\u201d These were my marks from cartouche to inscribe over any plain, low trussing.\n\nLow-quality reproduction of the text from Vyse's journal, as it appears in Creighton's book.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t make much sense as written, and for good reason. In 2015, Creighton wasn\u2019t sure of many word readings and scattered question marks throughout his transcript. They\u2019re all gone now even though the text isn\u2019t any clearer. (He concedes the point a few pages later.)\n\nI\u2019m not confident in many of his readings because the provided photo isn\u2019t sharp enough to confirm them. The words \u201cFor Raven & Hill\u201d more closely seem to read \u201cH Raven & Hill,\u201d which are the words actually painted in the chamber. The words \u201clow trussing\u201d do not seems to appear in the photograph he provided, though I cannot read the squiggle in their place. (Vyse did not use the word \u201ctrussing\u201d in his published work.) For that matter, the word Creighton reads as \u201cinscribe\u201d seems to have a loop at the start rather than Vyse\u2019s distinctive dotted \u201ci.\u201d\n\nRegardless, though, the meaning seems to be that Vyse was recording a dedication of \u201cH Raven & Hill\u201d painted in the chamber along with the existing cartouche that he had copied into his notes. Creighton reads this instead as orders to forge a cartouche, too. Because he does not transcribe the surrounding lines, Creighton left out too much of the context to support his reading of the line he claims to be a smoking gun.\n\nFrankly, even if we accepted all of Creighton\u2019s evidence at face value, it would mostly suggest that Vyse\u2019s team tried to make some markings easier to read by repainting them and Brewer thought they did so bad a job that it essentially made them into new figures. I don\u2019t think this is what happened, but there are many interpretations of the evidence short of intentional forgery that Creighton failed to consider.\n\nThe final chapter simply repeats all the previous chapters\u2019 arguments, which themselves had already been restated in summaries at the end of each chapter. These, in turn, were recycling material from The Secret Chamber of Osiris. A lot of this book is repetition and recycling. Worse, there are consistency errors as the author brings up points for later discussion that vanish, and repeats earlier points as though presenting them for the first time.\n\nOverall, the book is downright uninteresting. It has nothing new to say to readers of his earlier book. It is obsessed with minutiae to the exclusion of context, arguing for a forgery without establishing a compelling motive and by making assumptions about \u201csecret\u201d texts that Vyse must first have found and somehow chose not to report, even though such a discovery would itself have been cause for celebration. (Not to mention confirmation of the inscriptions in the Pyramid.) Creighton\u2019s argument asks us to share his own ignorance about the political, social, cultural, and archaeological contexts in which Vyse operated, and it expects readers to come to the book already accepting the notion that there is no other reason to believe the pyramids to be of dynastic Egyptian origin except for the quarry marks found within them.\n\nI find it encouraging that you\u2019ve spotted what the \u201cRaven & Hill\u201d reference really is. I take it that others will do likewise, or at least spot the quotation marks, which are surely obvious even in a poor quality image of Vyse\u2019s near impenetrable handwriting. Funny how they escaped his various listed helpers, \u201chandwriting experts\u201d included.\n\nBizarrely, Creighton drew attention to the relevant inscription in the pyramid:\n\n\u2014and this was with respect (?) to his last book. How this can remain a selling point for this one escapes me, but as such it has been presented. I gather that he has made the significant advance of dropping all the caveats.\n\nAfter this, I can safely say Creighton is in the bantamweight division of fringe authorship.\n\nReply\n\nJean Stone\n\n9/23/2016 02:53:06 pm\n\nThis whole thing puts me in mind of the original Stargate movie with Daniel presenting his arguments for, essentially, ancient aliens, including criticizing Vyse and I remember the novelisation actually expanded that argument. Wonder which fringe source they got it from. I also wonder if any people were inspired into fringe-y beliefs from that film. Not that it was new in its use of those elements, but what is in this field anyways?\n\nOf course, if Creighton's argument (or at least working premise) is that the pyramids are supposed to be some sort of repositories of pre-Flood knowledge, shouldn't he start out by trying to demonstrate that it actually happened? Oh, right...\n\nAnyways, thanks for the review Jason!\n\nReply\n\nMartin Stower\n\n9/23/2016 09:17:43 pm\n\nYear of the original was 1994, which suggests that they got it direct from Sitchin, as not so many had repeated the claim by then.\n\nReply\n\nDavid Bradbury\n\n9/23/2016 03:01:21 pm\n\nAny readers live near Aylesbury?\nCatalogue entry from the Centre for Buckinghamshire Studies:\n\nConcerning Creighton\u2019s suggesting that the name \u201cBrewer\u201d appears in the manuscript journal, when he presented the relevant image (now missing) on GHMB, it was cropped to such an extent that the word was barely shown adequately and all and any context which might help us determine if it is a name was excluded.

After all, the significance and importance of these marks as being the primary means in helping Egyptology determine the provenance of the Great Pyramid appears to be something that YOU (from your comment below) seem to have bought into and agree with:\n\n\"Who Built the Great Pyramid?\n\nThe Great Pyramid is largely anonymous, but controversial hieroglyphs hidden above the King's Chamber say who built the pyramid. We look at efforts to discredit the glyphs.\n\nby Jason Colavito\"\n\nhttp://jcolavito.tripod.com/lostcivilizations/id10.html\n\nSo, you are effectively saying in your comment above that the Great Pyramid is \"anonymous but [for] controversial hieroglyphs hidden above the King's Chamber\".\n\nIt must surely follow then that if these fourth dynasty chamber markings are shown to have been faked as Creighton claims, where then does that leave your assertion given that you evidently rely upon these marks to identify the pyramid's owner (and, by extension, its age)?\n\nIt renders your argument above utterly mute; in your own words, without these glyphs the Great Pyramid becomes an anonymous structure. Which, if my understanding is correct, is precisely Creighton's point.\n\nMr Colavito, you cannot have it both ways.\n\nReply\n\nMartin Stower\n\n9/26/2016 12:41:40 pm\n\nNot sure why you\u2019ve included the URL of this page.

If so, the button marked \u201cReply\u201d may be a clue.\n\nI\u2019d suggest also that the caveat I quoted (Jason\u2019s words) covered your point in advance.\n\nReply\n\nMartin Stower\n\n9/26/2016 02:00:13 pm\n\nRobertson, Robinson . . .\n\nReply\n\nPeter Robertson\n\n9/27/2016 06:33:54 am\n\nMr Colavito,\n\nYou write (above):\n\n\u201cHis next piece of evidence is the fact that one of Vyse\u2019s assistants, the man who drew copies of the marks, signed two of twenty-four drawings on the wrong side, thus \u201cproving\u201d that they were made before the quarry marks were painted onto the wall in a different and/or incorrect direction.\u201d\n\nI have read Creighton\u2019s interpretation of that particular piece of evidence (in his previous book) and, I feel compelled to say, your review here of it in no way reflects what Creighton has written or, indeed, the point he was making. (I presume he makes the same point in his latest offering).\n\nAs I understand it, the point Creighton was making in his last book with this particular evidence was to argue that Vyse\u2019s assistant, Mr J R Hill, seems to have used his signature to lock in the orientation of the drawings he was making so that, when they were sent back to London, the academics there would know the chamber orientation of the signs Hill had drawn i.e. when rotating a particular sheet so that Mr Hill\u2019s signature could properly be read, then this would rotate the signs on the sheet to the particular orientation they held in the various chambers. It is a credible point Creighton makes that such a scheme would have been needed and employed by Hill since the signs were painted into the chambers with a jumble of orientations.\n\nCreighton then points out that Mr Hill\u2019s signature recorded the wrong orientation for the Khufu cartouche (and some other signs). Creighton asks, quite reasonably, why Hill\u2019s signature, when used as his 'compass' would correctly lock in the orientation of all his other drawings but not the Khufu drawing. Creighton speculates that one reason for this might be that Hill originally copied the Khufu name from some other source where it had been drawn horizontally, hence why Hill signed it in that fashion, failing to realise that simply rotating this already signed horizontal drawing to paint it vertically into the chamber would betray his deception.\n\nYour simplistic \u201csigned two of twenty-four drawings on the wrong side\u201c serves only to misguide, obscure and gloss over the actual point Creighton was making and I feel is a great disservice to responsible and reliable critical review.\n\nYou continue (above):\n\n\u201cCreighton finds that Vyse made several attempts at copying the cartouches of Khufu, each time getting some of the details wrong until he finally made a correct copy. Creighton instead reads this as progressive efforts to draft a fake cartouche to forge, with the final details\u2014specifically three horizontal lines in the circle within the cartouche\u2014hastily added at the end to \u201cfix\u201d the spelling of Khufu due to late-breaking discoveries elsewhere at Giza that month.\u201d\n\nAs you point out, this is also from Creighton\u2019s previous book which I read some time ago. (In passing, why should you object to him repeating this piece of evidence in his latest book if the focus of the new offering is entirely on this possible forgery in the Great Pyramid, presenting more evidence to back up the original contention? I am sure there will be many who will pick up his new book and will not have read the single chapter in the previous work. I fear you are nit-picking here for no other reason than to nit-pick and it is tedious).\n\nOnce again, your assessment of this piece of evidence Creighton presents is woefully inadequate and presents an entirely false impression. Creighton does not argue that \u201cVyse made several attempts at copying the cartouches of Khufu, each time getting some of the details wrong until he finally made a correct copy\u201d. This is a complete misrepresentation of the actual point Creighton is making.\n\nVyse is copying into his diary what was supposed to be in the chamber. So why, Creighton rightly asks, did he record the Khufu cartouche into his diary incorrectly on TWO occasions? That is the reasonable and valid question Creighton is asking.\n\nFinally, Vyse does make a correct copy of the Khufu name with circle and lines in his diary. So why, Creighton asks, did he not correctly draw it with his first or second attempts? Creighton points out that Vyse, in his first two copies of the Khufu cartouche, managed to see and copy two tiny dots in the name but somehow managed to miss the much larger detail of the triple lines in the circle. How is that reasonably possible? It is a fair question Creighton asks given that Vyse tells us in his very own words that he examined this chamber in minute detail.\n\nPersonally, I do not think with the evidence in the chapter from his previous book that Creighton categorically proves forgery took place in these chambers of the Great Pyramid.

And I say that because, in the first place, I tend not to form my reading list on the opinions of others and especially not when those opinions are at a complete variance from my own experience.\n\nIt rather seems to me, Mr Colavito, that in your zeal to conform with mainstream opinion, you have thrown much of your objectivity aside and I fear this will leave your readership wholly uninformed of the actual argument Creighton is making in these books and of the evidence he uses to support it. And, in the long run, that will not be good for your readers, for your blog or, indeed, for your own career as a reliable, reasonable and credible reviewer.\n\nYou have much to say in defence of a book which (presumably) you haven\u2019t read. Caution is suggested: you are tending to confirm what Jason has said about the repetition and recycling in this book\u2014its having \u201cnothing new to say to readers of his earlier book\u201d.\n\nYou have much in common with someone who posts on GHMB. I suggest you look him up!\n\nReply\n\nChris Aitken\n\n10/2/2016 08:39:35 am\n\nI'm just going off the cuff here, as I'm no expert. But it always amazes me how people can't seem to except that people simply evolved. In the case of The Great Pyramid it seems obvious that a) It was built by and ascribed to the correct individual. b) This structure is really the apex of pyramid development in ancient Egypt. There's plenty of evidence of previous failed attempts. Also, since this practice reached a pinnacle at this juncture...there's really nothing as great afterwards...there was one smaller black pyramid built afterwards, but the romans stripped it...thereafter burials moved to the valley of the kings. Basically, pyramids became too ridiculous and expensive, and despite the clever traps became beacons for bandits.\n\nWhat annoys me the most about these so-called fringe theories is that they not only dumb down these ancient societies, but also deflect the real search for more ancient civilizations yet undiscovered. Humans evolved...even Homo erectus built fires. Is this when civilization begins? Just a thought...\n\nReply\n\nLeave a Reply.\n\nAuthor\n\nI'm an author and editor who has published on a range of topics, including archaeology, science, and horror fiction.
