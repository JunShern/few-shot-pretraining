    "text": "There are almost too many sites and resources for big languages like French, Spanish and German.\n\nWhen you\u2019re learning a language like these, the problem is usually deciding which resource to use rather than not being able to find one.\n\nBut what about those of us who want to learn a less popular language (minority or endangered)?\n\nOften times it\u2019s a real battle to find even one solid resource for a minority or endangered language.\n\nI can\u2019t possibly cover every single language in a post like this so the advice that I could offer for say, Australian Aboriginal languages, could be useless to someone learning a native American language.\n\nBut I\u2019ll keep this as general as possible.\n\nSince I put this post together several years ago, awesome sites such as italki have popped up which offer a glimmer of hope for many learners of minority languages.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t help everybody however.\n\nNow, because of the difficulty and higher level of frustration involved in learning a minority language, it\u2019s really important that you have the right level of dedication to learning it in the first place.\n\nThis is important for all languages but I say even more so for a minority language where there are hardly any resources.\n\nI say this because:\n\nThe lack of resources can be incredibly frustrating, discouraging and downright boring.\n\nVery little or no opportunity to practice with other people. You\u2019ll spend most of the time reading and/or listening without much-needed practice time.\n\nMinority languages in nearly all cases don\u2019t offer any financial incentive. In other words, a big language like French or Spanish can help you find employment or get a raise but if you speak the Nyulnyulan language, it\u2019s highly unlikely you\u2019ll make a living out of it.\n\nMinority speakers are often harder to find even in their home country. If you learn Irish for example and travel to Ireland, it\u2019s not always easy to find Irish speakers because there\u2019s another dominant language.\n\nWhy do you want to learn a minority language and is your determination strong enough to persevere despite these points?\n\nHere are some steps you can take:\n\nFind out what resources are available first\n\nPretty obvious starting point.\n\nSince minority language resources are so scarce, it makes sense to take note of and collect all the material at your disposal first.\n\nWhen I started out learning the Irish language for example, I literally made a list of all available resources both free and paid before I even got started just so I knew what I was working with.\n\nI took note of every decent site, YouTube channel, blog and so on that I could find so I had a really good idea of the kind of stuff out there for learning Irish.\n\nThis is also a very good time saving strategy for later because you\u2019ll know where everything is.\n\nIs it enough material though?\n\nSo looking at that list of resources you\u2019ve put together and knowing where everything is and what\u2019s available to you \u2013 is it actually enough to learn the language?\n\nThere is surprisingly a lot available for some really obscure languages.\n\nTake a language like Igbo for example from Nigeria in Africa.\n\nYou can find some amazing resources (such as this one) and YouTube channels for learning it which is more than adequate for learning the language to a reasonable level of fluency.\n\nHowever there also languages like the Jingpho language of Burma which have hardly anything to work with.\n\nSo if you do want to learn a language like Jingpho, what do you do without resources?\n\nGet in touch with those who have gone before you first of all\n\nIn the case of Jingpho, let\u2019s say the only online resource you can find is a Bible translation site (usually the case for a lot of obscure languages).\n\nThis is a helpful starting point.\n\nIt means that you know for a fact there are people out there who have already done what you\u2019re trying to do.\n\nAnd they\u2019re probably the best people to ask off the bat.\n\nGet in touch with them straight away and ask for advice on where you can find resources or who you can contact.\n\nI recently got in contact with some people out in the Northern Territory of Australia to ask about indigenous languages out there and they were super helpful with information so I know this works from experience.\n\nNext stop: Professors and linguistics departments\n\nThis is kind of the same advice as above.\n\nExperts on minority and obscure languages are often found in linguistics departments of universities.\n\nMy semantics lecturer at university was a fluent speaker of an Australian aboriginal language of which there are no available online resources currently.\n\nHe\u2019s one of only a few non-aboriginal guys who know the language and if I wanted to learn it he\u2019d be the guy I\u2019d call.\n\nGoogle Scholar is awesome for this.\n\nIf you go to the Scholar search tool and look for the language you want to learn, you\u2019ll usually get a bunch of journal articles written by experts in it.\n\nYou can then take the name of the professor who wrote the paper, do a Google search of him or her and it\u2019ll bring up the department they work for along with their contact details.\n\nThere\u2019s no way to be sure how helpful they\u2019ll be until you contact them but it\u2019s definitely a good place to start.\n\nNGO\u2019s, interest groups and government organizations\n\nWith a lot of minority and endangered languages around the world you\u2019ll often find government programs or non-profit work being done to revitalize them.\n\nExamples of these are the Aboriginal Resource And Development Services (ARDS) in Australia, Our Mother Tongues in the US, Korero Maori in New Zealand, E-Skuvla in Norway and Gaelchult\u00far in Ireland.\n\nAlso try community and religious groups in your area.\n\nThe important thing is that you put yourself out there and try every avenue.\n\nWhen you have limited video and audio material\n\nYou can actually learn a heck of a lot from very limited audio and video material. More than you realize is possible in fact.\n\nThe Irish I learned in 8 months back before I traveled to the Gaeltacht was mostly learned from watching just a handful of the same videos repeatedly.\n\nIt actually doesn\u2019t require a whole lot of audio and video material to pick up the structure, phonetics and the general rhythm of the language.\n\nCardinal Mezzofanti for example reportedly gained most of his insight into the 39 languages he learned by listening to people say the Lord\u2019s prayer in their language. From that little bit of information he was able to learn a lot about how each language worked.\n\nYou can pick up a lot of the language just by listening to the same audio or video repeatedly.\n\nSometimes having tonnes of resources deludes you into thinking that you\u2019re making more progress but of course there\u2019s a limit to how much you can actually use anyway.\n\nFinally: be a trailblazer\n\nIf you are learning a language with extremely limited resources then be part of the solution.\n\nPeople coming after you who want to learn can benefit from your progress.\n\nThis is how you can do it:\n\nCreate a blog like this one. Document your progress learning the language (as I did with Irish for example) and offer advice to help the next person.\n\nFurther to that, be the only resource on the Internet with material for that language. All the resources you discover and create yourself should be shared and made available to benefit others. New learners will love you for it.\n\nOf course if you have the money and time then travel. Learn the language while making a difference in their community. Help raise awareness if it\u2019s an endangered language by letting the world know about it.\n\nHope that helps!\n\nAre you learning a minority or endangered language? What resources have you found?"
