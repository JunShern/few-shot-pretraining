Now it\u2019s not so much the all-seeing eye of the lens but seeing from our own perspective via selfies, filtered photographs and apps to change the way we look.\n\nYou can even add things - the six pack you wanted, a spot of virtual plastic surgery and you edit out what you want - including less than appealing fellow tourists who happen to get in shot - or when the boyfriend in your favourite selfie becomes an ex- just edit him out.\n\nDisreputable bloggers have even been caught out pretending to travel the world in glam spots via photos stunted up in their bedrooms.\n\nThe idea of the all-seeing lens is completely out of the window and you now control your own image, 99 per cent of the time.\n\nWhich is a huge relief for us normal types - although a six pack is just too far."
