She also promised that she would expand protections for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender Americans as well.\n\n\u201cThere are still too many places where LGBT Americans are targeted for harassment and violence, and there are too many young people who are uncertain and scared of what their future might hold,\u201d Clinton said in the same statement.\n\n\"Right now in America, you can get married on Saturday and be fired from your job on Monday just because of who you love,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI see the injustices that are happening in our country, and that is why I\u2019m committed to working with Jim and others to end discrimination against the LGBT community once and for all,\u201d the former secretary of State added.\n\nThe Supreme Court issued a landmark 5-4 decision last June legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide.\n\nObergefell v. Hodges requires that every state recognize the practice nationwide under the 14th Amendment\u2019s Equal Protections Clause.\n\nClinton currently leads the race for next year\u2019s Democratic presidential nomination by a wide margin, boasting a 21-point lead nationally over Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), according to the latest RealClearPolitics average of samplings."
