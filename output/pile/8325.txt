    "text": "I finished grouting my new bathroom tiles a weeks ago. I have noticed when I wipe the tile down with a damp cloth the grout darkens as if it has absorbed water. The grout is Bal superflex colour limestone. I have since applied two coats of Fila grout protector. But the grout still discolours when wet. Do I need to apply a waterproofing agent or is this normal. I do not want to start using the shower until I am sure the grout is waterproof.\nMany Thanks\nJohn.\n\nHi, Thanks for the reply.\nPreparation:\nAll plaster removed, walls dry lined with the green plasterboard, plenty of adheshive to prevent any board bounce.\nTwo coats of sealer applied to the boards.\nTiles, adhesive and grout came from a friend of a friend that has a wholesale outlet. I told him the bathroom layout and he supplied what he termed a good adhesive (can't remember the name. Tiles were not grouted until they had been on for a week. Grout was applied with a grout gun which ensured deep penetration and finished of in the traditional way.\nA friend has recommend a penetrating silicone sealer \"aquamix for showers and baths\" am I better safe then sorry.\nJohn\n\nDIY how to tutorial projects and guides - Did you know we have a DIY Projects section?
