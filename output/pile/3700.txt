    "text": "Waiting with all My Strength\n\n\u201cWait for the Lord; be strong, and let your heart be courageous. Wait for the Lord.\u201d\n\nPsalms 27:14 CSB\n\nYesterday, I began listening to the audiobook of Anne of Green Gables (through LibriVox). Chapter 2 includes a description of Anne waiting at the train station. When the reader spoke the words featured on my Bible page, I was caught off guard.\n\nShe was sitting there waiting for something or somebody and, since sitting and waiting was the only thing to do just then, she sat and waited with all her might and main.\n\nAnne of Green Gables\n\nTears puddled in my eyes. Do I wait with all my \u201cmight and main\u201d or strength? Even now I feel my eyes moisten because I know the answer.\n\nI haven\u2019t been a good waiter\u2026 I\u2019ve been a good alternate planner. I excel at pretending I didn\u2019t hear the word \u201cwait.\u201d\n\nOn the cover of my paperback copy is the image of Anne waiting on a bench with her carpetbag. The Lord reminded me again the value of the wait.\n\nIn the waiting,\n\n\u2026 I seek Him more.\n\n\u2026 I trust Him more.\n\n\u2026 I have new experiences.\n\n\u2026 I grow in the pause.\n\n\u2026 I smell the roses.\n\nI\u2019m challenged to sit longer and ask Him when to move. And be obedient.\n\nPrayer\n\nLord, thank You for the way You speak through everyday things like a story about an orphaned girl. I want to trust You, but my actions don\u2019t show it.\n\n\u201cI pray to (You) \u2014my life a prayer\u2014 and wait for what (You) say and do. My life\u2019s on the line before (You), my Lord, waiting and watching till morning, waiting and watching till morning.\u201d (Psalm 130:5-6 MSG)\n\nIn Jesus\u2019 name, Amen.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next?\n\nFriend, are you in the waiting? I received an amazing piece of advice from my friend and pastor Jan Greenwood. Focus on what is in front of you right now. Don\u2019t miss out on present blessings because you are focused on future maybes.\n\nAsk the Lord what He has for you to learn in the waiting. And focus on what He says. Focus on Him. Wait on the Lord with all your \u201cmight and main.\u201d\n\nHere are some other devotionals I\u2019ve written on the waiting. I hope you will find encouragement through these!"
