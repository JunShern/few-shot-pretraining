I have decided to host a \"Live\" Giveaway. Here is how this works. To win, start posting as many comments to this post as you wish. Each comment has to answer any of the following:\n\n1. What would you change about my blog?\n\n2. What do you like or love about my blog?\n\n3. What would you like to see more of on my blog?\n\n4. Is there anything you would like me to add to my blog?\n\n5. Is there anything you would like me to stop posting on my blog?\n\nOkay, you can make as many comments as you like, but your comments have to answer any or all of the questions listed above. I want to make my blog better for you - therefore I need you to tell me what you want.\n\nSome time today (it's a surprise) I will use Random.org to chose a random comment. The winner will be announced both on twitter and here on my blog. Feel free to tweet about this too.\n\nI bet you are wondering what you are going to win, but I'm not telling you. I will tell you it is a $25 gift certificate - but you won't know to where until it is over.SURPRISE!!!\n\nI love your I Hate Meatloaf Recipe, i hate meatloaf too and hate to cook it, i cant wait to try yours out it actually looks like something i might enjoy! And i'm sure my hubs would love it too!!! Also i think you have a really cute header and button!!!\n\nI would love to see more recipes! I am learning how to ocok, because i did not know my way around a kitchen until i got married and am still new too it, but i love to find new recipes and try them out!!\n\nI think the pink background is very pretty, but I don't think it says \"you\"You have such a warm caring personality, the plain pink is not you. It needs to show your personality. Like in the backgrounds I sent you the other day. :)\n\nI love your blog.. its so colorful, i love reading it. I would agree maybe the only thing i would change is like the person above me suggests is just a pic :) That and more posts! :) Your blog is what i want mine to be :D\n\nJust to clarify a little bit, I'd love to see more giveaways for dog/cat lovers. There's a ton out there for kids/babies/moms but dogs/cats..not so much. I see you have 3 of your own (so do I) so I'd love to win some great products for pets, too.\n\nI like the format of your whole blog. It's easy to navigate throughout it, and I like your colors. Like the pink in the background is light enough so that it looks nice but at the same time it's really easy to read everything. Also, on your sidebar I love your SassyMom button!"
