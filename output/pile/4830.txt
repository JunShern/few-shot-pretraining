    "text": "Microsoft Offers Peek at Office for Windows Phone 8\n\nMicrosoft revealed today in a blog post some details about how Office 13 will integrate with Windows Phone 8. The blog post mostly discusses the cloud-based features of Office 13, but notes that the latest version of Microsoft's suite of productivity software will extend to mobile devices, as well. For example, Microsoft Word will remember where you were reading within a specific document and when re-opened on another device (such as a Windows Phone 8 smartphone) will go straight to that spot. PowerPoint and Excel will exhibit similar behaviors. Microsoft has also revealed a glimpse of the refreshed design of Office for Windows Phone 8, though it stopped well short of revealing all the consumer-facing features. Windows Phone 8 is expected to debut later this year."
