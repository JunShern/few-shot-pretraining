    "text": "TENNESSEE_FOOTBALL.JPG\n\nTennessee head coach Butch Jones (center) and defensive coordinator John Jancek (left) react in the season-opening victory against Austin Peay on Aug. 31.\n\n(Amy Smotherman Burgess/The Associated Press )\n\nEUGENE \u2014 Turnover on Oregon\u2019s coaching staff is so rare it has been called the \u201cgold standard\u201d of coaching continuity.\n\nIf\n\nstaff at Tennessee can\u2019t quite match Oregon\u2019s unique tenure \u2013 four UO assistants rank among the 17 longest-serving coaches at the same school \u2013 it was still assembled with the same overriding philosophy of ensuring coaching consistency whenever possible, and eliminating mistakes because of it.\n\nThus, when the No. 2 Ducks face Tennessee on Saturday at Autzen Stadium, they\u2019ll be facing a well-oiled coaching machine whose start at Rocky Top was technically in December, but with roots that go back 15 years to Mount Pleasant, Mich.\n\n\u201cYou win with consistency,\u201d Jones said Wednesday. \u201cA lot of these players have had five or six coaches at their respective positions in our program so I think the overall development of a student-athlete is aided by consistency and continuity and it\u2019s everywhere. It\u2019s in recruiting, with coaches knowing the families first-hand, knowing their personalities, but it\u2019s also feeding off the strengths of their coaching staff. Oregon is a great illustration of that, and I think we are, too.\u201d\n\nIt will certainly be a change-up from facing Virginia, which had five new coaches, including both coordinators, after head coach Mike London cleared house following a 4-8 season in 2012.\n\nThe effect of having as many familiar faces as Tennessee does can be revealed a bit in video study of Jones\u2019 previous teams. Since becoming head coach of Central Michigan in 2007, and Cincinnati in 2010, Jones has a 52-27 overall record.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re doing some of the same things that his staff did at Cincinnati,\u201d said Oregon offensive coordinator Scott Frost, who has been in Eugene since 2009.\n\nFrost would need to stay on staff until 2039 to match the program-record 31 years Gary Campbell has spent as running backs coach. That\u2019s four more years than any other assistant in the nation has spent at one school.\n\nOregon also has 27 years of experience from offensive line coach Steve Greatwood (in two stints) and 22 from Nick Aliotti (in three stints).\n\nThe hidden benefit of such stability doesn\u2019t fully reveal itself, however, simply in similar formations, said Pete Roussel. He's a former assistant coach for six years who now runs coachingsearch.com, a website devoted to tracking the coaching industry, and he gave the Ducks their \u201cgold\u201d rating.\n\nCollege coaching can be a game of telephone that starts with one vision from the head coach but trickles differently through separate position groups. The key is when coaches understand the message the same, and deliver a consistent message to their units.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a big reason that they\u2019ve been able to get off to the terrific start and gain a lot of momentum in recruiting right away,\u201d said Roussel, citing Rivals\u2019 21st-ranked recruiting class of 2013 \u2013 one spot higher than Oregon \u2013 that Jones and Co. threw together in two months. The Vols\u2019 2014 class is ranked second nationally.\n\n\u201cWith that kind of staff continuity they know how to anticipate the problems because they know the problems in their systems,\u201d Roussel said. \u201cI think they can really reduce a lot of the little things you might not notice as a general fan. They won\u2019t have nearly as many communication errors on the sidelines because they\u2019ve done this three different times together.\u201d\n\nOregon linebacker coach Don Pellum, in his 22nd year at his alma mater, said that applies to UO\u2019s staff, as well.\n\n\u201cIf a guy says a certain thing you know exactly what it means,\u201d Pellum said. \u201cThat\u2019s opposed to someone new who you have to go through the process of interpreting it.\u201d\n\nFive Tennessee assistants coached with Jones at both Cincinnati and Central Michigan. Another, safeties coach Willie Martinez, has known Jones since 1998, when Martinez coached the secondary and Jones the tight ends for the Chippewas. In March 2011,\n\nfour of his then-Cincinnati assistants were offered \u201cother BCS, high-caliber, high-profile jobs. And all four stayed.\u201d\n\nJoe Bernardi has been a part of both staffs.\n\nAfter two years as Tennessee\u2019s offensive line graduate assistant, he joined Oregon in the same role in February. Some traditions transcend a coaching staff, he cautioned. In Knoxville, coaches weren\u2019t allowed inside the football center without wearing slacks, while at Oregon there is a more laid-back approach. When Bernardi showed up in dress pants on his first day,\n\njoked with him he was overdressed. Later that day, Helfrich drove Bernardi to get lunch at the Albertson\u2019s grocery store deli.\n\nThe goal \u2013 winning \u2013 is universal, however. Oregon and Tennessee\u2019s method of achieving that has been perfected in years of practice together.\n\n\u201cThey all believe in Butch and so they\u2019ve all stayed together,\u201d Bernardi said. \u201cObviously his formula has worked.\u201d"
