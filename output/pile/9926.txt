    "text": "Introduction {#S0001}\n============\n\nColon cancer is one of the most common malignant cancers and among the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide.[@CIT0001] The combination therapy of oxaliplatin and fluoropyrimidine has been the standard adjuvant therapy in patients with stage III/IV colon cancer. However, these chemotherapies are toxic and sometimes ineffective. Due to its heterogenicity, multiple genetic mutations were regarded as the underlying causes of this disease, for example, mutations in phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) and the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Deregulation of MAPK pathway genes have been found, including the amplification and mutation of KRAS, BRAF, and MEK1.[@CIT0002] Therefore, targeting the downstream MEK in the mutated tumors might be a new strategy for colon cancers, especially the patients with KRAS or BRAF mutations. Several MEK inhibitors have entered clinical trial evaluation. However, clinical activity was poor following the treatment with any single MEK inhibitor, and acquired drug resistance appears inevitable.[@CIT0003]--[@CIT0008] Trametinib is a novel oral MEK inhibitor which has been approved by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) for BRAF-mutated patients alone or in combination with dabrafenib.[@CIT0009]--[@CIT0011] Combination remedies of MEK inhibitors, rather than single medicine therapy, was considered to be more effective in various tumors.[@CIT0012]--[@CIT0014] Therefore, there is an urgent clinical demand for new synergic agents to cooperate with trametinib to enhance the survival of patients with colon cancer.\n\nInterferon-Stimulated Gene 15 (ISG15), a ubiquitin-like protein (UBL),[@CIT0015] is an important oncoprotein and has become a potential diagnostic[@CIT0016] and therapeutic[@CIT0017] target for cancer treatment. The function of ISG15 was largely underestimated mainly due to its low expression in most human malignancies.[@CIT0018] Some studies have found that ISG15 expression was elevated and ISG15-conjugates in many malignant tumors, including melanoma[@CIT0019] and oral squamous cell carcinoma[@CIT0020],[@CIT0021] as well as malignancies of the breast,[@CIT0016] endometrium,[@CIT0018] and bladder.[@CIT0022] However, the roles of ISG15 in tumorigenesis and its responses to anticancer treatments in colon cancer remain largely unknown. In a recent study, Roulois et al[@CIT0023] showed that DNA methylation inhibitor 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (5-AZACdR) could enhance the expression of ISG15 in LIM1215 colon cancer cells, which implied the nature of ISG15 as a tumor suppressor in colorectal cancer. Controversially, Desai et al[@CIT0018] discovered that ISG15 expression and ISG15-conjugated proteins in two colon cancer cases were up-regulated in comparison to normal colon tissues. Whether ISG15 acts as a tumor suppressor or promotor remains controversial.\n\nIn this study, we explored the function of ISG15 in colon cancer cell lines. Our results showed that high expression of ISG15 was an intrinsic feature for colon cancer, and ISG15 promoted the cell proliferation and metastasis. Trametinib could increase the expression of ISG15 shown by gene expression analysis. After treatment of a synergistic combination of trametinib with ISG15 siRNA, proliferation and colony formation was inhibited in vitro. Thus, combined targeting of ISG15 and MEK might be a promising therapeutic strategy for colon cancer treatment.\n\nMaterials and Methods {#S0002}\n=====================\n\nTissue Samples and Study Cohort {#S0002-S2001}\n-------------------------------\n\nSixty-six pairs of tumor samples and matched adjacent non-tumor tissues were obtained from the Shanghai Outdo Biotech Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). All the patients signed informed consent forms. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Taizhou Hospital of Zhejiang Province. ISG15 expression was detected in all specimens. Two pathologists were appointed to evaluate the specimens separately without prior knowledge of the clinical statuses of the specimens.\n\nImmunohistochemistry {#S0002-S2002}\n--------------------\n\nImmunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed using the biotin-streptavidin HRP detection system according to the manufacturer's instructions. The tissue chips were incubated with ISG15 antibody (1:100; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) overnight at 4\u00b0C in a humidified container. Biotinylated secondary antibodies (Zhongshan Golden Bridge Biotechnology Co. Ltd., China) were applied. The sections were incubated with HRP-streptavidin conjugates appropriate for detecting ISG15. Proper positive and negative controls were included in each IHC assay.\n\nWestern Blotting Analysis {#S0002-S2003}\n-------------------------\n\nTotal proteins (30 \u00b5g) were subjected to fractionation by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting assay. Antibodies used in the study included the following: anti-ISG15, anti-PARP, anti-c-Myc, anti-pERK, anti-ERK (all Abcam, Cambridge, UK), and anti-GAPDH (Zhongshan Golden Bridge Biotechnology Co. Ltd., China).\n\nCell Culture and RNA Interference {#S0002-S2004}\n---------------------------------\n\nHuman colon cancer cell lines were obtained from the State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, including RKO, HCT116 and SW480. And all the cells were tested and authenticated by an AmpFlSTR Identifiler PCR assays in the year of 2019 in TSINGKE Biological Technology Company. The results showed that RKO and SW480 were 100% exact matched, and HCT116 was 98% matched. All the cell lines were confirmed to be mycoplasma negative via a PCR method and directly thawed from the liquid nitrogen jar. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, USA), 100mU/mL penicillin, and 100 \u00b5g/mL streptomycin in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37\u00b0C. Cells (1x10 5 cells/well) were seeded into six-well plates and transfected with the indicated constructs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen/Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 72 h, the transfected cells were harvested for further analysis. The sequence of the siRNA sense strand was as follows: si-ISG15\\#1: 5-'TCCTGGTGAGGAATAACAA-3\u02b9, si-ISG15\\#2: 5-'CCAUGUCGGUGUCAGAGCUTT-3\u02b9.\n\nCCK-8 and Colony Formation Assays {#S0002-S2005}\n---------------------------------\n\nCCK-8 assay kit was used for colon cancer cell proliferation analysis. Colon cancer cells were seeded in 96-well plate at a density of 5x10^\\^3^ cells per well. After incubation, 10 \u00b5L CCK8 was added to the wells at different times. The absorbance was measured at 450 nm by a microplate reader (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Colony formation assay was performed to detect the capacity of cell proliferation. RKO, HCT116 and SW480 cells were seeded into 35 mm dishes with 3x10^\\^3^ cells per well and cultured for 10 days. Colonies were then fixed with 10% formaldehyde for 30 min and stained for 5 min with 0.5% crystal violet.\n\nWound Healing Assay {#S0002-S2006}\n-------------------\n\nColon cancer cells were cultured in 6-well plates and grown until 80--90% confluence. After that, the cell monolayer was scratched with a sterile pipette tip. An Olympus microscope was applied for taking pictures of cell morphology at different time intervals (0,48h). The results were analyzed by ImageJ software.\n\nMatrigel Invasion Assays {#S0002-S2007}\n------------------------\n\nThe capacity invasiveness was determined in a 24-well transwell plate (8 up pore size; Costar). Briefly, 6x10^\\^\\ 4^ cells were suspended and added to the upper chamber of each insert coated with 200 mg/mL of Matrigel (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). After 48 h, the cells that traversed the membrane and spread to the lower surface of the filters were stained with haematoxylin and counted.Each experiment was repeated three times independently.\n\nRNA Extraction and qRT-PCR {#S0002-S2008}\n--------------------------\n\nTotal RNA was isolated through the guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction method using TRIzolsolution (Invitrogen, USA), and cDNA synthesis was done using the Advantage RT-forPCRKit (Takara, Japan). The forward and reverse primers were designed to span two different exons for each gene.The primers for human ISG15 were forward:5\u02b9-TGGACAAATGCGACGAACC-3\u02b9; reverse: 5\u02b9-TTCGTCGTTCACTCGCC-3\u02b9.CFX96 Real-Time PCR detectionsystem (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) was used to perform qRT-PCR. The threshold cycle number was determinedusing iCycler software version 3.0. Reactions were performed in duplicate and the threshold cycle numbers wereaveraged. The data were analysed using the 2\\^^\u2212\u0394\u0394CT^ method.\n\nEdu Assay {#S0002-S2009}\n---------\n\nQuantification of cellular proliferative capacity was determined by 5-Ethynyl-2\u02b9-deoxyuridine assay using a Cell-Light TM EdU Apollo^\u00ae^488 In Vitro Imaging Kit (Guangzhou RiboBio Co., LTD), according to the manufacturer's instruction.\n\nIdentification of Differentially Expressed Genes from Public Microarray Data {#S0002-S2010}\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGSE112282 gene expression profiles were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibusdatabase (GEO, [<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo>]{.ul}). These profiles, deposited by Wyce A et al in 2018, are comprised of two untreated replicates of human colon cells and two replicates of the same cells treated with 25 nM trametinib for 24 h and 96 h. The dataset was analyzed with R BIOCONDUCTOR packages, raw datasets were normalized and DEGs were screened out via the LIMMA package using the cut-off criteria of P-value \\< 0.05 and \\|log2(fold change)\\|\\>1.5.\n\nFunctional Enrichment Analysis {#S0002-S2011}\n------------------------------\n\nDAVID ([<https://david.ncifcrf.gov/>]{.ul}) was used to perform functional and pathway enrichment analysis. Gene ontology (GO) analysis, including biological process (BP), cellular component (CC) and molecular function (MF)[@CIT0024] enrichment analysis, was carried out for the upregulated genes. P\\<0.001 was regarded as indicating statistical significance.\n\nProtein-Protein Interaction Network Construction {#S0002-S2012}\n------------------------------------------------\n\nIn order to interpret the underlying molecular mechanisms, the online Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING) database was utilized to construct a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of the DEGs. An interaction score of not \\< 0.4 (medium confidence score) was deemed statistically significant, and the PPI was visualized. Subsequently, the hub genes were selected based on connection degree by CYTOSCAPE software.\n\nStatistical Analysis {#S0002-S2013}\n--------------------\n\nAssays for characterizing phenotypes of cells were analyzed by Student's test or One-Way ANOVA, presented as the means \u00b1 SDs. In the clinical specimen study, the associations of ISG15expression with categorical variables were analyzed using the \u03c72 test or Fisher's exact test as appropriate. And other variables were analyzed with Spearman correlation test. P values of \\<0.05 were deemed statistically significant.\n\nResults {#S0003}\n=======\n\nUp-Regulation of ISG15 Expression in Colon Cancer Samples {#S0003-S2001}\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\ncBioPortal was applied for cancer genomics datasets analysis. ISG15 was amplified and the mutation frequency was 5% in colon cancers ([Figure 1A](#F0001){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Among them, the ones with high expression of ISG15 mRNA accounted for 4% ([Figure 1B](#F0001){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Moreover, ISG15 mRNA was over-expressed in colon cancer specimens compared to their non-tumor counterparts. ([Figure 1C](#F0001){ref-type=\"fig\"}, P \\< 0.05). Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that patients with high ISG15 expression had significantly shorter overall survival (OS) than patients with low ISG15 expression ([Figure 1D](#F0001){ref-type=\"fig\"}, P \\< 0.05). Using Western blot, 83.3% (10/12) of the cases showed relatively higher ISG15 expression than their non-tumor counterpart, consistent with the results of mRNA expression analysis ([Figure 1E](#F0001){ref-type=\"fig\"}). To evaluate whether the expression of ISG15 changes as colon cancer progresses, IHC was performed by using an independent formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded-based (FFPE-based) tissue microarray (TMA) including 66 pairs of colon cancer patients. The results showed that ISG15 expression in colon cancer tissues was obviously higher than that in adjacent noncancerous colon tissues ([Figure 1F](#F0001){ref-type=\"fig\"}). As indicated in [Figure 1G](#F0001){ref-type=\"fig\"}, the mean immunoreactivity scores of the normal and cancer tissues were 1.02 and 5.01, respectively. Samples with scores above 5 were considered as high ISG15 expression ones, leading to the greatest number of tumors classified as having or not having a clinical outcome. In our study, high ISG15 levels were detected in 30/66 (45.5%) of colon cancer patients. The results showed ISG15 expression did not correlate with patient sex, age or lymph node status (P\\>0.05). It was, indeed, associated with poor histological classification (P \\< 0.01, [Table 1](#T0001){ref-type=\"table\"}). Overall, our data suggested that ISG15 level was higher in colon cancer samples.Table 1Correlation Between ISG15 Expression and Clinicopathological Features of Colon Cancer Patients P-Value=0.0087\\*: the ISG15 Expression Was Associated with Poor Histological ClassificationStatistical Results of ISG15 Expression in 66 Colon Cancer Cells SpecimensVariablesISG15 ExpressionNLow Expression, nHigh Expression, nP-valueAll cases663630Age\u2265 504321220.2997^a^\\< 5023158GenderMale3718190.3254^a^Female291811Pathology gradeI (well)1293**0.0087^\\*\\*,b^**I-II (moderate)372314II-III (poor)17413Lymph node statusN-4021190.8015^a^N+361511[^1] Figure 1Upregulation of ISG15 expression in colon cancer samples.

(**C**) Expression of ISG15 in 286 TCGA cancer and 41 normal samples indicated that ISG15 was obviously upregulated in colon cancer. (**D**) Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that high ISG15 expression predicted poorer prognosis in colon cancer. The error bars in all graphs represent SD, and each experiment was repeated three times (\\*\\*p\\< 0.01 \u2009). (**E**) The difference in protein expression levels of ISG15 in colon cancer tissues was compared with the corresponding adjacent tissues by Western blot in 12 pairs of human colon cancer specimens. (**F, G**) The differential expression of ISG15 in colon cancer samples (n = 66) and adjacent normal colon tissues (n =66) is shown by immunohistochemistry. ISG15 staining scores for tumor tissues and normal tissues are represented by a frequency distribution (0--4: low expression; 5--12: high expression).\n\nKnockdown of ISG15 Inhibits Cancerous Proliferation and Migration {#S0003-S2002}\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe investigated the effect of ISG15 suppression on the malignant phenotypes of colon cancer cells. Results showed that knockdown of ISG15 with si-SG15\\#1 and si-SG15\\#2 significantly inhibited cell proliferation in the RKO, HCT116 and SW480 cell lines ([Figure 2A](#F0002){ref-type=\"fig\"}). As indicated in [Figure 2B](#F0002){ref-type=\"fig\"}, knockdown by siRNAs resulted in reduced ISG15 protein in colon cancer cell lines. And we concluded that si-SG15\\#1 inhibitory effect was stronger than si-SG15\\#2. Colony formation assays and Edu assay also indicated that si-ISG15\\#1 could significantly inhibited the proliferation and growth of colon cancer cells ([Figure 2C](#F0002){ref-type=\"fig\"} and [D](#F0002){ref-type=\"fig\"}, [[Figure S1A](https://www.dovepress.com/get_supplementary_file.php?f=226395.zip)]{.ul} and [[B](https://www.dovepress.com/get_supplementary_file.php?f=226395.zip)]{.ul}). Next, we examined the migratory abilities of HCT116 and SW480 cells by using transwell migration assay. HCT116 and SW480 cells transfected with si-ISG15\\#1 displayed lower efficiency of cell migration compared to the vector control ([Figure 2E](#F0002){ref-type=\"fig\"} and [F](#F0002){ref-type=\"fig\"}, P\\<0.01). We also performed a wound healing assay by using RKO, HCT116 and SW480 human colon cancer cells. As shown in [Figure 2G](#F0002){ref-type=\"fig\"} and [H](#F0002){ref-type=\"fig\"} and [[Figure S1C](https://www.dovepress.com/get_supplementary_file.php?f=226395.zip)]{.ul}, after 48\u00a0hrs of silence, si-ISG15\\#1 treatment significantly impeded gap closure compared to the vector control. These results indicated that suppression of ISG15 could inhibit the cell growth and migration in colon cancer cells.Figure 2Knockdown ISG15 inhibits cancerous proliferation and migration. (**A**) Cell proliferation profiling in RKO, HCT116 and SW480 cells infected with si-ISG15\\#1 or si-ISG15\\#2 continuously for 3 days as analyzed by a CCK8 assay (\\*p\\< 0.05, \\*\\*p\\< 0.01). (**B**) Protein levels of ISG15 in the RKO, HCT116 and SW480 cell lines infected with si-ISG15\\#1 or si-ISG15\\#2. GAPDH was used as an internal control.

(**E, F**) Transwell invasion assay in si-NC or si-ISG15\\#1 transfected HCT116 and SW480 cells. The error bars in all graphs represent the SDs (\\*\\*\\*p\\< 0.001).

Data are shown as the mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (\\*\\*\\*p\\< 0.001).\n\nTrametinib Treatment Activates the Expression of ISG15 by Identification DEGs {#S0003-S2003}\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe gene expression profiles of GSE112282 were downloaded from the GEO database, to unravel molecular mechanisms underlying trametinib in the tumors of an experimental mouse model. The GSE112282 dataset contained following four groups: DMSO (control) or 30 nM trametinib for 24 or 96\u00a0hrs each in the RKO colon cancer cell line. We found 193 and 304 genes differentially expressed between the control and trametinib groups at 24 and 96\u00a0hrs, respectively (\\>1.5-fold, p\\<0.05, [Figure 3A](#F0003){ref-type=\"fig\"} and [B](#F0003){ref-type=\"fig\"}, [[Figure S2A](https://www.dovepress.com/get_supplementary_file.php?f=226395.zip)]{.ul} and [[2B](https://www.dovepress.com/get_supplementary_file.php?f=226395.zip)]{.ul}). Gene ontology analysis were applied to discover the functions of the DEGs for 24\u00a0hrs ([[Figure S3](https://www.dovepress.com/get_supplementary_file.php?f=226395.zip)]{.ul}) and 96\u00a0hrs ([[Figure S4](https://www.dovepress.com/get_supplementary_file.php?f=226395.zip)]{.ul}). The DEGs of up-regulated genes were significantly enriched in biological processes related to ossification, transforming growth factor beta receptor signaling pathway (i.e., ISG15, TOB1, ID1) at 24\u00a0hrs ([Table 2](#T0002){ref-type=\"table\"}) and type I interferon signaling pathway, cellular response to type I interferon (i.e., ISG15, IRF9, IFITM3, IFI6, IFIT/12/3, and IP6K4) at 96\u00a0hrs ([[Table S1](https://www.dovepress.com/get_supplementary_file.php?f=226395.zip)]{.ul}). The STRING database and Module analysis via Cytoscape software were constructed to identify gene interactions, the significant hub nodes of the network included IP6K2, ISG15, IFI6, IFI27 and IFITM1 at 24\u00a0hrs ([Figure 4](#F0004){ref-type=\"fig\"}) and IFITM3, IRF9, ISG15, IP6K2 and HIST1H2BD at 96\u00a0hrs ([[Figure S5](https://www.dovepress.com/get_supplementary_file.php?f=226395.zip)]{.ul}). Node degree and betweenness were calculated by the DMNC method to obtain hub nodes. The top 15 candidate hub genes were identified which may play a central role in this network ([[Table S2](https://www.dovepress.com/get_supplementary_file.php?f=226395.zip)]{.ul}). And no matter which stage for the trametinib groups (24\u00a0hrs or 96\u00a0hrs), we found ISG15 always appears as a hub gene and was associated with type I interferon signaling pathway and cellular response to type I interferon. Therefore, the PPI network analysis and hub gene selection and analysis showed that treatment of colon cancer cells with trametinib could induced a dependency on ISG15 signaling especially in terms of type I interferon signaling pathway.Table 2Functional Enrichment Analysis of Up-Regulated Genes Were Significantly Enriched in Biological Process Terms (24h)CategoryIDTerm/gene functionGeneIDGene countpvalueGO_TERM_BPGO:0001503OssificationTOB1/FSTL3/ANO6/FGFR3/ID1/ID3/JUND/SMAD3/TP53INP2/BMPR1A/BMPR2/KLF10/TMSB4X/TUFT1/KAZALD1/CAT/IFITM1/DHRS3/EIF2AK3/ISG15201.28E-07GO_TERM_BPGO:0007179Transforming growth factor beta receptor signaling pathwayCDKN2B/ID1/SMAD3/SMAD7/SMAD9/PTPRK/SKIL/BMPR1A/KLF10/CAV1/CAV2/ADAM9123.58E-06GO_TERM_BPGO:0007178Transmembane receptor protein serine/threonine kinase signaling pathwayTOB1/FSTL3/CDKN2B/HES1/ID1/SMAD3/SMAD7/SMAD9/SKIL/BMPR1A/BMPR2/KLF10/CAV1/CAV2/ADAM9166.40E-06GO_TERM_BPGO:0030282Bone MineralizationANO6/FGFR3/SMAD3/BMPR1A/BMPR2/KLF10/TUFT1/EIF2AK3/ISG1596.56E-06GO_TERM_BPGO:0071560Cellular response to transforming growth factor beta stimulusCDKN2B/ANKRD1/ID1/SMAD3/SMAD7/SMAD9/PTPRK/SKIL/BMPR1A/KLF10/CAV1/CAV2/ADAM9138.08E-06GO_TERM_BPGO:0071559Response to transforming growth factor betaCDKN2B/ANKRD1/ID1/SMAD3/SMAD7/SMAD9/PTPRK/SKIL/BMPR1A/KLF10/CAV1/CAV2/ADAM9139.80E-06GO_TERM_BPGO:0050678Regulating of epithelial cell proliferationCDKN1B/CDKN2B/ANG/HOXA5/HES1/ID1/MIR24-2/SMAD3/PTPRK/PEX2/BMPR1A/BMPR2/CAV1/CAV2/MAGED1151.53E-05GO_TERM_BPGO:0060337Type I interferon signaling pathwayIRF9/IFI6/IFI27/IFIT2/IFIT1/IP6K2/IFITM1/ISG1582.15E-05GO_TERM_BPGO:0071357Cellular response to type I interferonIRF9/IFI6/IFI27/IFIT2/IFIT1/IP6K2/IFITM1/ISG1582.15E-05GO_TERM_BPGO:0050673Epithelial cell proliferationCDKN1B/CDKN2B/ANG/HOXA5/HES1/ID1/ID2/MIR24-2/SMAD3/PTPRK/PEX2/BMPR1A/BMPR2/CAV1/CAV2/MAGED1162.63E-05GO_TERM_BPGO:0034340Repose to type I interferonIRF9/IFI6/IFI27/IFIT2/IFIT1/IP6K2/IFITM1/ISG1583.22E-05GO_TERM_BPGO:0030278Regulation of ossificationTBO1/ANO6/ID1/ID3/JUND/SMAD3/BMPR1A/BMPR2/IFITM1/DHRS3/ISG15113.49E-05 Figure 3Trametinib treatment activates the expression of ISG15 as shown by the identification of DEGs.

As shown in [Figure 5B](#F0005){ref-type=\"fig\"}, trametinib decreased the expression of c-Myc, a cell proliferation related protein, and improved the expression of Bax, an apoptosis inducing protein. Furthermore, trametinib increased the mRNA and protein expression of ISG15 ([Figure 5A](#F0005){ref-type=\"fig\"} and [B](#F0005){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Therefore, we treated cancer cells with ISG15 siRNA and trametinib and found that this combination had a synergistic effect that inhibited cell proliferation ([Figure 5C](#F0005){ref-type=\"fig\"}, [[Figure S1D](https://www.dovepress.com/get_supplementary_file.php?f=226395.zip)]{.ul}) and colony formation ([Figures 5D](#F0005){ref-type=\"fig\"}, [[S1E and F](https://www.dovepress.com/get_supplementary_file.php?f=226395.zip)]{.ul}). Next, we also examined the expression of c-Myc and Bax by Western blot following the knockdown of ISG15, and found that suppression of ISG15 had no effect on c-Myc, but promoted the upregulation of Bax ([Figure 5E](#F0005){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Finally, we combined trametinib with si-ISG15 to investigate whether ISG15 inhibition enhances the cytotoxicity of trametinib against colon cancer at the protein levels. Our results showed that si-ISG15 synergized with trametinib to dramatically reduce the expression of ISG15 and increase the pro-apoptotic genes PARP and Bax ([Figure 5F](#F0005){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Together, ISG15 inhibition combined with trametinib displayed synergistic inhibitory effects in colon cancer cells.Figure 5ISG15 inhibition enhances the anti-cancer effect of trametinib in colon cancer cells.

Also, there has been voices demanding a re-evaluation of ISG15.[@CIT0033] Several investigations has demonstrated the carcinogenicity of ISG15, which played an important role in cancer-associated inflammation.[@CIT0018],[@CIT0020],[@CIT0021],[@CIT0023] ISG15 is also associated with cytoskeleton disruption, cancer cell migration and poor prognosis.[@CIT0034] Recently, ISG15 is thought to function both as an oncogene and a tumor-suppressor gene in different tumors.[@CIT0035] For example, knockdown of ISG15 expression reduced breast cancer cell motility compared to the control in cell migration assays.[@CIT0036] In another study, Jeon et al[@CIT0037] reported that ISG15, as a possible tumor suppressor, provoked anchorage-dependent cell growth after doxorubicin treatment in mouse breast cancer model. Adam R.Brown[@CIT0038] purposed a process through which those select IFN-stimulated genes, especially ISG15, may facilitate colon cancer cell survival and growth by suppressing apoptosis, which was consistent with our findings. In addition, protein ISGylation could exacerbate experimental colitis and colitis-associated cancer. Jun-Bao Fana[@CIT0039] discovered an elevation of inflammation-related cytokines as well as the p38 MAP kinase activation induced by LPS in mouse. Above all, ISG15 plays an important role in the progression of various tumors. However, the pathological or physiological functions of ISG15 and their implications for targeted therapy have not been clearly elucidated in colon cancer.\n\nIn our study, immunohistochemical analysis and Western blot analysis were used to detect ISG15 expression in colon tumor tissues and pericancerous tissues. The results demonstrated that the expression of ISG15 protein was significantly higher in tumors than that in adjacent control tissues. Additionally, inhibition of ISG15 with siRNA could suppress tumor growth and migration in colon cancer. Using bioinformatics, it was also predicted that the ISG15 mRNA level of colon cancer patients was higher than that of normal patients, and the expression level of ISG15 was inversely proportional to the overall survival (OS) in colon cancer patients. Further investigation in gene expression indicated that trametinib treatment could induce the expression of ISG15. While suppression of ISG15 by siRNA could enhance the cytotoxicity of trametinib against colon cancer.\n\nIn summary, we have identified ISG15 as an oncogene in colon cancer, with a mechanism that mainly dealt with the proliferation and metastasis of colon cancer cells. Notably, our data point out the possibility that inhibition of ISG15 with small molecules which do not currently exist combined with trametinib treatment would be a novel therapeutic strategy for colon cancer.\n\nEthics Approval and Consent to Participate {#S0005}\n==========================================\n\nThe human colon cancer tissues as provided by the Ethics Committee of Taizhou Hospital of Zhejiang Province.\n\nFunding {#S0006}\n=======\n\nThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No.81572850).\n\nDisclosure {#S0007}\n==========\n\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors.\n\n[^1]: **Notes:** \\*\\*p\\<0.01, The ISG15 expression was associated with poor histological classification. ^a^Fisher's exact test was used for statistical analyses. ^b^Pearson's \u03c72 test was used for statistical analyses.\n"
