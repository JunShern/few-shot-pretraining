The decision revealed that the company refusing to comply with the subpoena was being fined by the courts. \u201cWhen the Corporation failed to produce the requested information, the court held the Corporation in contempt, imposing a fixed monetary penalty to increase each day the Corporation fails to comply,\u201d the decision read. In their ruling, the judges said that sovereign immunity could not insulate foreign countries from criminal liability, meaning in this case that the U.S. legal system could have \u2018subject-matter jurisdiction over criminal offenses\u2019 involving this foreign company, owned by a foreign government. \u201cConsequently, we are unconvinced that Country A\u2019s law truly prohibits the Corporation from complying with the subpoena,\u201d the judges concluded.

Flynn well and we'll continue to focus on doing what we do here everyday.\u201d Update 1 p.m. EST Dec. 18: Attorneys for Flynn asked U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan to delay his sentencing Tuesday after the judge asked whether Flynn wanted to wait until after his cooperation with Mueller\u2019s team was completed before being handed his sentence, CNN reported. Authorities said in court records filed earlier this month that Flynn has met with investigators 19 times since pleading guilty in December 2017. He\u2019s provided information in three separate investigations, including the probe into Russian election meddling, officials said. >> From Cox Media Group's Jamie Dupree: After stern criticism, federal judge delays Flynn sentencing Sullivan paused court proceedings for about half an hour Tuesday to allow Flynn time to confer with his attorneys about whether to postpone the sentencing hearing until after he\u2019s completed his cooperation with authorities, Vox.com reported. \ufeffFlynn\u2019s attorney suggested in court that most of Flynn\u2019s cooperation with Mueller had been completed, the news site reported, although the attorney added that it was possible Flynn could cooperate further in a case brought against his former business associates in a federal court in Virginia. >> Michael Flynn's former business associates accused of illegally lobbying for Turkey An indictment unsealed Monday showed authorities charged Flynn\u2019s former business partner, Bijan Kian, 66, and Turkish businessman Kamil Ekim Alptekin, 41, with conspiracy, acting in the U.S. as illegal agents of the government of Turkey and making false statements to the FBI.

Prosecutors asked a judge earlier this month to sentence Flynn to little or no jail time in connection to the case, citing his cooperation with investigators. >> More on Robert Mueller's investigation In a memo filed last week, Flynn\u2019s attorneys asked he be spared jail time and suggested that FBI agents played to his desire to keep the situation quiet and, as a result, kept him from involving a lawyer when investigators approached him just days after Trump\u2019s inauguration. Mueller\u2019s team has sharply pushed back at any suggestion that Flynn was duped, with prosecutors responding that as a high-ranking military officer steeped in national security issues, Flynn \u201cknows he should not lie to federal agents.\u201d >> Former Trump attorney Michael Cohen sentenced to 3 years in prison, Trump responds on Twitter Flynn is, so far, the only member of Trump\u2019s administration to plead guilty to charges in the Mueller investigation, according to Reuters.

Trump has frequently railed against the investigation, which he has called a witch hunt, and denied any collusion with Russia. \ufeffThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nAs two Chicago police officers tried to locate the source of gunshots on the city\u2019s South Side Monday night, they scrambled up an embankment and onto a set of southbound train tracks, walking south and keeping an eye on a northbound train as they searched for the potential shooter. Police officials said Officers Eduardo Marmolejo, 36, and Conrad Gary, 31, likely never heard the southbound train coming up behind them. According to The Chicago Tribune, one officer\u2019s body camera footage offered investigators a glimpse into what took place as both men were killed. \u201cThey had no idea the train was behind them,\u201d Anthony Guglielmi, a Chicago police spokesman, told the Tribune. \u201cThey hear the noise (of the northbound Metra train), we suspect. That masks the noise of the other train that is right behind them.\u201d The oncoming South Shore train struck the officers on a viaduct over 103rd Street, the Tribune reported. They were killed instantly. >> Read more trending news The newspaper reported that it was not yet known how fast the South Shore train was going, but Michael Noland, CEO and president of the Northern Indiana Commuter Transportation District, said South Shore trains typically go around 65 mph on that stretch of track. The company, which operates South Shore trains on the city\u2019s Metra tracks, is downloading the train\u2019s event recorder to turn over to police investigators. Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Monday night that Marmolejo and Gary, both relatively new officers on the force, responded shortly after 6 p.m. that evening to 103rd Street and Dauphin Avenue when the city\u2019s ShotSpotter system picked up the sound of gunshots. \u201cWhile doing the most dangerous thing a police officer can do -- and that is to chase an individual with a gun -- these brave young men were consumed with identifying a potential threat to their community and put the safety of others above their own,\u201d Johnson said. Guglielmi told the Tribune that the body camera footage shows the officers get out of their patrol car after spotting someone who could have been the shooter. They cross the viaduct and head south in the direction they apparently believe the suspect is moving. \u201cThey were deciphering the offender\u2019s direction of flight,\u201d Guglielmi told the newspaper. A gun and shell casings were found near where the officers died, the police spokesman said. A person of interest was being questioned in the case Tuesday, the Tribune said. Johnson said Monday night that Marmolejo had been on the force for more than two years. Gary was on the force for 18 months. According to the Officer Down Memorial Page, Marmolejo is survived by his wife and three children. Gary, a U.S. Air Force veteran, is survived by his wife and an infant daughter. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel was subdued as he spoke of the effect the officers\u2019 deaths on the department, which has lost two other officers in the line of duty this year. \u201cI\u2019m not usually one for a loss of words, but I think you can understand the idea in trying to express the immense sense of devastation to the Chicago Police Department,\u201d Emanuel said. He praised Marmolejo and Gary for working to keep their community safe, at the expense of their own lives. \u201cThere they were, responding to ShotSpotter, doing their job trying to protect the rest of us,\u201d the mayor said. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost two young men, both fathers with young families. This holiday will never be the same for those two families, and while our hearts are with them, we\u2019ve lost people who answered the call to make Chicago a better place.\u201d Emanuel said he spoke to one of the families alongside the superintendent. \u201cThere are no words that can express the grief, the sense of loss -- it just knocks you back on your heels,\u201d Emanuel said. \u201cAs we go about our time with our families, let us remind ourselves that there are others who cannot.\u201d Marmolejo and Gary are the third and fourth Chicago officers slain in the line of duty this year. Officer Samuel Jimenez, 28, was one of four people who died, including the gunman, in a Nov. 19 mass shooting at the city\u2019s Mercy Hospital & Medical Center. The other victims in that shooting were Dr. Tamara O\u2019Neal, 38, and 24-year-old pharmacist Dayna Less. All three were killed by O\u2019Neal\u2019s former fianc\u00e9, 32-year-old Juan Lopez, who then killed himself. Cmdr. Paul Bauer, 53, was killed the afternoon of Feb. 13 when he attempted to help other officers take into custody a fleeing man sought for questioning in a previous shooting. The Tribune reported that officers had approached Shomari Legghette, a four-time felon, to question him when he ran away on foot. Bauer, who was in downtown Chicago for a meeting after a morning of training on mass shootings, heard the call over his radio and, after spotting Legghette running by, joined the chase. The 31-year police veteran got into a struggle with Legghette in a stairwell of a state building, where he was shot six times, the newspaper reported. Bauer\u2019s weapon was in its holster and his radio and handcuffs were found next to his body. The Tribune reported that Legghette has been indicted on 56 felony counts of first-degree murder, armed violence, weapons and drug offenses. Marmolejo and Gary were assigned to the department\u2019s Calumet District, which has lost three other officers this year. Two died of suicide and a third, Officer Vinita Williams, 47, died after collapsing at the station in July, the Tribune said."
