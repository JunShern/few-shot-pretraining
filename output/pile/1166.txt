    "text": "Friday Fictioneers \u2013 Capitol\n\nThe first remarkable thing about the space was its spaciousness. Hall after colonnaded hall receded into the far distance. Clouds obscured the vaulted ceiling. Even Marcus, safe big Marcus holding my hand, was diminished.\n\nThe second remarkable thing\u2013the Capitol refracted identity. Mirrors on every wall reflected mirrors, and I saw myself seeing.\n\nThe third thing, well, everyone knows that \u2013the mortality of gods. They killed the Emperor that day, right in front of me. And the mirrors multiplied his dying into a massacre of thousands, one death for each of his crimes.\n\nNow we must learn to worship ourselves.\n\nFriday fictioneers is a weekly challenge set by Rochelle Wisoff Fieldsto write a 100-word story in response to a photo prompt. You can find other stories here\n\nI found your story fascinating for two reasons. The first is that it\u2019s uniquely personal to you; I can\u2019t imagine anybody else writing it. The second is that there are little quirks in the writing where you depart from the norm in a way that you wouldn\u2019t normally (e.g. \u2018safe big Marcus\u2019 rather than \u2018big safe Marcus\u2019). You\u2019ve written a very attractive story. I think my favourite phrase was \u2018and I saw myself seeing\u2019.\nKudos, Neil!\n\nWell done, Neil. That last Line: Now we must learn to worship ourselves. is food for thought. My immediate thought was that this would be great for the selfie generation. However, I\u2019m not sure whether the selfie is a sign of self-worship or more aligned with crippling self-doubt.\nBest wishes,\nRowena\n\nAnd the mirrors multiplied his dying into a massacre of thousands, one death for each of his crimes.\nAs if this could ever make up for all his crimes ~ whatever they might have been.\nEven Marcus, safe big Marcus holding my hand, was diminished. This line makes me feel as if the story is being told by a child. Probably not so.\n\nWow, I really loved this one, Neil! Great use of a child\u2019s voice to give an intriguing perspective. The structure and pacing really worked for me and I was hooked by the \u201cwell, everybody knows that\u201d line. Nice effect with the mirrors too, both visually and symbolically. One of your best that I\u2019ve read, I\u2019d say.\n\nI liked this story, and the hope that goes with it. You can only make a god die once no matter how many crimes he\u2019s committed, so let\u2019s imagine it in metaphor. Anything is better than a god emperor, even rule by ados with smart phones.\n\nHave to agree with others here \u2013 that idea of the mirrors, of seeing a massacre in one death, a reflection of all the deaths the Emperor has taken \u2026 Just so good. Terrific take on the prompt and some wonderful imagery"
