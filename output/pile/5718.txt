How can catch this?\n\nA:\n\nYou have to configure your table schema for News to handle foreign key changes with ON DELETE: Either \"set to null\", or \"set to default\", or \"set to specific value\", or \"delete\". Not sure if you can do this variably, though, but if you think about it that'd be insane: You have referential integrity precisely because you want your relations to be strictly enforced. Randomly changing them if you delete a category row would go completely counter to that.\nMuch better to handle this correctly yourself by first UPDATEing the to-be-modified rows.\nUPDATE News SET id_cat = 2 WHERE id_cat = 3;\nDELETE FROM Category WHERE id = 3;\n\n(I don't know the appropriate Symfony/Doctrine method to affect this.)\nYour available options depend on your database. You can always say ON DELETE CASCADE to delete all dependent rows; other options may or may not be available to you.\n\n"
