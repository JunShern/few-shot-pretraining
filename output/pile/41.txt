Seems weird to me. The other way around or both uppercase.\n\nb) Top bar seems empty, maybe an actual logo (that adds some other\ncolor/shade) would chance that.\n\nc) \"See an example\" needs no-Javascript fallback. I assumed a video behind it.\nPleasant surprise to see something that finally showed me what it is all\nabout. I strongly suggest not hiding that. It is below the break for me and\nadds a lot.\n\nd) Ned Flanders takes away the credibility and earnesty the page build up so\nfar. Bad!\n\ne) \"private, secure, & friendlier\", the comma after secure seems out of place\nto me. I am not an english native but from what I know it would be more normal\nwithout it. \"friendlier\" is not a word, is it? Also, how is it secure if you\ndo not tell me how you actually secure it (both for normalos and hackers\nplease)...?\n\nf) entry is a bad empty word. I guess you already tried to find a better one.\nCan't think of one myself. :-(\n\ng) \"a personal journal that you'll love to use\" = you love the journal\n\n\"why you'll love us\" = you love the company\n\nh) \"Oh snap, remember this?\" same as Ned, does not fit the otherwise very\nnoble theme at all.\n\ni) The open book has a weird shape. Does not feel right to me. Maybe if it was\ntaller?\n\nx) No privacy policy (as a techie \"only you can see your entries\" screams for\nencryption against YOU (and/or hackers, this is important)), no contact, no\nnothing to make it human.\n\ny) Privacy tainted by Google Analytics.\n\n~~~\nugh\nRe: e) (This is purely my personal opinion, but \u2026) Anyone who uses the serial\ncomma [1] must be seriously insane. How can you? Doesn\u2019t your brain explode?\n(Calm down, calm down \u2026 [2] \u2026 there, better.)\n\nFriendlier is indeed a word, the comparative of friendly.\n\nAmazing idea, by the way, beautifully executed and immediately captured my\nimagination.\n\n[1] <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma>\n\n[2] <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_i1xk07o4g>\n\n------\nadammichaelc\nI notice that a huge part of my daily life is recorded in email conversations\nwith other people -- it would be cool if I could forward a conversation to\npost@ohlife.com and it would automatically make it a part of my journal and\nmake it aesthetically pleasing at the same time.\n\nGreat job on the execution of this app. I have talked to others who have had\nthis same idea, but their execution was ugly/unexcting/etc. This is clean and\nsimple.\n\n~~~\njbail\nTaking your thought a step further, let's also save the comments you make on\nothers' blogs and bring them into your journal/blog as well.\n\nAt the end of the day, I don't need another blog or a slight variation on\nblogging technology. I need something that basically blogs for me. If I can\nadd value to my site by adding comments like this one to other people's sites\n(then pressing this \"magic\" button (maybe a bookmarket?) to automatically save\nit as part of my blog), that'd be pure awesomeness.\n\nBeyond saving boatloads of time for everyone who used it, it would create a\nmore connected blogosphere by allowing people to link their commenter accounts\n(like HN, Reddit, etc) to their primary blog...effectively giving people more\nownership over the things they write on others blogs, increasing author\nrecognition, etc.\n\n~~~\nLewisham\n_I need something that basically blogs for me._\n\nTumblr is pretty close to doing this, but the problem is its just context-free\nnoise. It's echoes from a very, very noisy set of interactions that you\nperform. I had a Tumblr blog that harvested photos, blog posts, Twitter,\nlast.fm etc etc. and it all meant absolutely nothing.\n\nThis isn't really blogging, it's journaling. Writing a diary is supposed to be\ntherapeutic because you're writing down the things you dare not talk about\nwith others (maybe not even your SO). It's not about what you do, it's about\nhow you feel.\n\nThat's why I would like to see encryption mentioned somewhere, and pushed\nhard. I wrote one entry to see how it works, but I'm going to disable the\nnotifications until I know that my personal outpourings are not actually being\nread by others.\n\n------\nsgupta\nHey HN - we made this in our spare time, just because it was something we\nwanted to use. When we told some friends about the idea though they wanted to\nuse it too, so we decided to release it. Many thanks for checking it out.\n\n~~~\nevandavid\nI love the idea. Love it. Like, really excited. However, I'm not prepared to\nuse a service like this in a hosted environment. Too many risks: you go out of\nbusiness, security, privacy, etc. Plus the information just feels to personal\nto be sitting on someone else's server. I would love to see a quick daily\nprompt like this added to Macjournal or similar software.\n\n~~~\nevandavid\nThat said, I'm sure there is a target market out there who will be more than\nwilling to use the product in its current format. I'm looking forward to\nseeing where this idea goes.\n\n------\npesco\nAccept PGP-encrypted mail seamlessly and you won't need a privacy policy\nexcept for those who like throwing their lifelog at random strangers. Be sure\nto use PGP/MIME to include the old message in your mailing.\n\nOf course, setting up PGP, let alone remembering the passphrase (gasp) is a\nlot to ask of the typical user who needs to use his mail client as a text\neditor.\n\nOtherwise, it's a cute idea, really. Please excuse cynicism.\n\n------\nryanwaggoner\nThe design is beautiful, but why would I use this over WriteRoom? For years\nnow, I've been writing at least 500 words in WriteRoom every single weekday,\nand I'm closing in on a year of doing it (and a bunch of other habits) without\nmissing a single day. It's not that hard, I know I'll probably never lose my\nentries (time machine + dropbox backups), and my privacy is more assured. I'm\njust not sure I see the advantage here...\n\n~~~\nTerry_B\nWriteroom + timemachine + dropbox. I don't think you're the target market :)\n\n~~~\nryanwaggoner\nTouch\u00e9. Can't believe I didn't stop to think about this :)\n\n------\niampims\nNo privacy policy is a no go for me.\n\n~~~\nKevinMS\nI have never read a privacy policy, EVER. Am I missing something good?\n\nIf they violate their own privacy policy do I have legal recourse?\n\nAnd is it even possible to write a privacy policy without loopholes?\n\n------\nmrduncan\nFirst of all, fantastic design!\n\nIs there any way to export posts - for example, if I wanted to share them with\na significant other or another family member?\n\nAlso, and this is mainly curiosity, how do you handle sending posts from the\npast for the first few days where there really isn't much history?\n\n~~~\nsgupta\nThank you!\n\nWe don't have export yet, but we've definitely wanted to share some of our\nentries with close friends and family too. We'll be brainstorming around this!\n\nRegarding past history: For your first week, we just send you your entry from\nthe previous day. After you've been using it for a week though, and some\nhistory has built up, we'll show you entries from a week ago (and then a month\nago, etc.).\n\nThanks for checking it out - really appreciate it!\n\n------\nthingie\nIt'd be nice to have some export feature. After few months, if I will use\nthis, you are going to have quite a lot of entries from me, and all of them\nare important to me, I don't want to lose them, so I'd like to be able to\neasily make backups to my own computer.\n\n------\njasongullickson\nPardon my French but; fucking beautiful.\n\n------\nvessenes\nI like it, and I signed up. I don't want to get emailed at 8pm -- that's after\nmy internet cutoff, so I faked a timezone. But, it would be nice to just\nchoose a time.\n\nAlso, who did your webdesign? I like it!\n\n~~~\nsgupta\nWe'll be adding the ability to change when the email is sent, and it should be\nout by next week. Clever workaround though!\n\nAnd thanks for the design compliment! We did it all in-house, so we really\nappreciate the kind words.\n\n------\npclark\nThis is really cool. I'm curious if _you_ can read the entries?\n\n~~~\nsgupta\nThanks for the kind words! We're currently working on encrypting the entries -\nthis is an MVP and we initially wanted to see if people like the idea.\n\n~~~\nmartey\nIt does say on the home page that \"Only you can see your entries.\" If they are\nnot currently encrypted, that would seem to be untrue.\n\n~~~\ncolonelxc\nEven if they do encrypt it, they will have to be able to decrypt them server\nside to send you your month old posts. That means the owners are technically\ncapable of also reading all of your posts.\n\n~~~\nmbenjaminsmith\nThat's not entirely true. If this were purely a web-accessible blog, there's\nno reason you couldn't encrypt/decrypt this in the client (sending and storing\nencrypted text). You'd have to throw out email posting in that case though.\n\n~~~\nandreyf\nI think you're on to something. I look forward to the day when we are shocked\nby unencrypted private data accessible on the server as we do un-hashed\npasswords.\n\n~~~\ndublinclontarf\nThere are a number of online password stores where all the information is only\ndecrypted on the client. Nothing new, just not widespread. Can't remember the\nname.\n\n------\nhooande\nOhLife is one of the few apps that I use every day. If you've ever tried to\nkeep a journal or any kind of organized daily log, I highly recommend it.\n\n------\nmdolon\nI'm going to try to call this one now: my gut instinct says this will be a\nhuge success. Hopefully I remember to check back a few months down the line to\nsee how my prediction faired.\n\nGreat work guys!\n\nEdit: I just noticed lists I email don't get formatted correctly. It's\nslightly annoying for such an otherwise beautifully designed layout.\n\n------\najcronk\nThere is a typo in the url at the end of the How did your day go? email.\nShould be ohlife.com/today, not ohlife.come/today\n\n~~~\nsgupta\nThanks for the heads up!\n\n------\na3_nm\nHow exactly is this service better than, say, a simple text file on my own\nmachine with a daily reminder set up through some other means?\n\nWhy would I want to use some third-party website for something so simple that\nI might as well do it myself? I can see some pretty annoying downsides (need\nto have a crypto layer because I don't want you to be able to read my journal,\nneed to export regularly the data to my own computer because I don't want you\nto be able to lose my journal), but no real advantages (it's not even more\nconvenient!).\n\nIn any case, I believe that the two following statements, at least, are plain\nwrong:\n\n\\- \"The easiest way to write your life story\": no, the easiest way is to fire\nup a text editor and start writing.\n\n\\- \"Only you can see your entries\": should read \"Only you and us can see your\nentries\".\n\n------\nd0m\nI'm not really sure I would use this. However, I really love the website\ndesign.. It's so clean. The colors are nice. The forms are simple. Maybe a\nlittle video would be nice on the frontpage.\n\n------\nblitzo\nYou wanna drop that ned flander out, not everyone know him\n\n------\nproexploit\nI like it. Many times I've wanted to start a journal, just to record memories,\nbut I detest writing. This makes it feel easy. We'll see how it goes.\n\n------\npesco\nIn reaction to the fact that I adore the idea despite the fundamental privacy\nproblem (see earlier comment), here is my spin on the theme in the form of two\nreally simple Unix shell scripts. :)\n\n<http://www.khjk.org/log/2010/jul/journal.html>\n\nThank you for the inspiration!\n\n------\ncvg\nReally like the simplicity of the idea and clean look of the site. Already\nreplied to the welcome message - waiting for it to post to the site.\n\nI like the daily emails as I don't visit too many sites daily, apart from HN\nand Gmail. This will be an easy way to log all that I'm up to. I'm not sure\nhow regularly I'll do this, but time will tell.\n\n------\nfizzfur\ngreat now I have des'ray in my head.\n\ninteresting idea... I'll give it a go for a while until someone realises I\nemail myself everyday. Does it get angry if I don't reply?\n\nmini feedback on home page: The 'see example' link needs to scroll the page\ndown for me, I didn't spot the page grow and was waiting for it to load.\n\n------\nyequalsx\nI think the vertical spacing between the various components is too much. If\nyou could move things up a bit it would work real well. The colors, fonts, and\ngraphics are very soothing and welcoming. I just didn't expect to scroll down\nso much.\n\n------\ntechietim\nI know your homepage says that all your posts are private, however, adding a\nprivacy policy page which outlines that in legal speak would probably be good\nidea.\n\nOtherwise, this looks great, and I'm looking forward to using it!\n\n~~~\nalttab\nYes, please! Tell me in no uncertain terms you will not give away, sell, or\ncrawl my data.\n\nI will then use it as a personal journal for work purposes. Perfect for\nfilling out during the morning with a cup of coffee.\n\n------\nGlide\nLove the design. I just signed up. Can't wait to see how well it'll help me\nkeep a journal.\n\nOne thing I noticed: on the login page can you make pressing tab in the login\nbox go directly to the password input box?\n\n------\ncheesey\nPleasing, private posterous?\n\n~~~\nsami_b\nThat is what I was also thinking. You could do that on Posterous with privacy\non, you can also attach files to the email.\n\n------\ndublinclontarf\n\"Once you have a few entries here, we recommend printing them out, sitting by\na fireplace, and reading them in Morgan Freeman\u2019s voice: \"\n\nLike a twinkie, like a twinkie.\n\n------\nTichy\nOk, nice enough, but why would I mail my private thoughts to the cloud?\nWriting a small script that mails a random email by me to myself should be\neasy enough.\n\n------\nyeti\nWell done, great concept and already I see a practical use for it in my life\n(tracking a new fitness program)\n\nThanks guys\n\n------\nchamza\nLove the idea. Good work fellas\n\n------\nfaramarz\nVery cool. Does that mean YC has a vested interest in your side project?\n\n------\nsomeone_here\nMay I ask how this is different from, say, private wordpress.com blogs?\n\n~~~\npclark\nI think they clearly articulate this on the home page\n\n"
