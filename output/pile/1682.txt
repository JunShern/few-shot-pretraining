    "text": "Q:\n\nHow do I apply AddHandler using OnCommand in ASP.NET\n\nI've been racking my brain trying to get this to work.  My event for my LinkButton isn't firing.  I'm figuring that it has SOMETHING to do with ViewState and that the button is not there when it tries to fire the event after the Postback or something.  \nWhen I click the Add button,it adds the link to the page and then when I click the Diplay Time\" linkbutton it should fire the event and display the CommandArgument data but it's not and i can't figure out why.\nHere's my code:\n<%@ Page Language=\"VB\" %>\n\n<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd\">\n\n<script runat=\"server\">\n\n    Protected Sub Page_Load(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs)\n\n    End Sub\n\n    Protected Sub btnDelete_OnCommand(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Web.UI.WebControls.CommandEventArgs)\n        Response.Write(e.CommandArgument)\n    End Sub\n\n    Protected Sub Button1_Click(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs)\n        Dim btn As New LinkButton()\n        btn.ID = \"lbn\"\n        btn.Text = \"Display Time\"\n        btn.ValidationGroup = \"vgDeleteSigner\"\n        AddHandler btn.Command, AddressOf btnDelete_OnCommand\n        btn.CommandArgument = Now.TimeOfDay.ToString()\n        btn.EnableViewState = True\n        Panel1.Controls.Add(btn)\n    End Sub\n</script>\n\n<html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n<head runat=\"server\">\n    <title></title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <form id=\"form1\" runat=\"server\">\n    <div>\n        <asp:Button ID=\"Button1\" runat=\"server\" Text=\"Button\" OnClick=\"Button1_Click\" />\n        <asp:Panel ID=\"Panel1\" runat=\"server\">\n        </asp:Panel>\n    </div>\n    </form>\n</body>\n</html>\n\nA:\n\nThe reason that's happening is that your dynamic button \"lbn\" needs to be drawn again on post back when it's clicked because the button doesn't exist after you click it. \nBasically you just have to dynamically add the button to the page again on post back of click of that button.\nI would recommend having the button already on the page but visible = false and then just showing it when you click the other button.\n\n"
