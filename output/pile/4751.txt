    "text": "Audition Songs from contemporary musical theatre writers\n\nChoosing an audition song from the new generation of musical theatre writers is bound to get you noticed for all of the right reasons.\n\nIt is very likely that the panel has not heard the song many times before.\n\nIt also shows them that you are interested in what is happening in the world of musical theatre.\n\nIt is unlikely you will be compared to another performer\u2019s version of the song because these are new songs for everyone\u2019s ears.\n\nIt will get you remembered if you introduce them to something they have never heard before.\n\nAs with all audition songs, it is massively important that you research the show the song has come from. You want to show that you understand the character and the acting of the story behind the song. If the song is a \u2018stand alone song\u2019 as some of them are in this collection then please write your own back story \u2013 keep it plausible but use this as an opportunity to add some meat to the bones of the song and make it a fully rounded and acted performance.\n\nThe terrific resource New Musical Theatre asked a number of it\u2019s writers to choose one of their own songs and one from another new musical theatre writer which would be suitable for an actor to sing at an audition \u2013 and to tell them why.\n\nHere are their choices along with some of our own:\n\nAudition Songs from The New Generation of Musical Theatre\n\nWe would love to know what your favourite audition song from a new musical is, let us know via Twitter @actorhub.\n\nClick on title to view the video\n\nClick on image to buy from Amazon\n\nRun Away With Me (click to view video)Sam Brown\n\nThis song comes from the musical The Unauthorized Autobiography of Samantha Brown written by the hugely talented team of Kait Kerrigan and Brian Lowdermilk.\n\nThe show is set at dawn on the day that Samantha Brown is supposed to leave for college, she is sitting in her car but can\u2019t turn the keys. She is filled with doubts and the show is told through a series of flashbacks from her senior year as Sam comes to terms with her parents expectations, her first love and a lost friendship.\n\nThis love song is sung by Sam\u2019s boyfriend Adam as he tries to get her to run away with him!\n\nHere is what Kait Kerrigan had to say about using this for an audition:\n\nOur friend Josh Young told us the reason he likes to use it in an audition is because as an actor, you\u2019re asking for something from your audience. It\u2019s easier to get the audience on your side than it is with a stationary ballad.\n\n\u201cLet me be your ride out of town. Let me be the place that you hide. We can make our lives on the go. Run away with me.\u201d\n\nThe Last Loser In The Universe (click to view video)Drew Gasparini\n\nI just love this song and it really is one of those perfect audition songs for a character actor.\n\nThe song was written for a specific project which Drew did not get but he loves the song and so put it out as a stand alone song. The song is a celebration of any young person who is cast aside for their love of something which isn\u2019t considered very \u2018now\u2019, the character singing this song\u2019s passion is magic.\n\nHere is what the composer Drew Gasparini has to say about this song\n\nEven when people look at you differently for what you do or believe in, there\u2019s always that fire inside you that says \u2018keep going.\u2019 The word loser is subjective, and that\u2019s what makes this character a hero\n\nLovable nobodies are a tried and true method of character writing and acting. I think this song allows for vastness and smallness. It\u2019s a toe tapper too\u2026. shit\u2026 at least I hope it is. My mom thinks it\u2019s good\u2026 so there\u2019s that\n\nThe links here are for Gasparini\u2019s cd but you can buy the sheet music for this song here\n\nMarie and Me (click to view video)Chasing The Day\n\nMaria and Me is taken from Will Van Dyke\u2019s album Chasing The Day. An album which features songs that were written on the road. Aboard planes. Across time zones. Between sets. In hotel lobbies. At 24 hour coffee shops. Miles apart. When the thought of home is your only companion. A collection of songs about the places life takes us and the people who bring us back.\n\nHere is why Will Van Dyke chose this song as his audition song recommendation:\n\nI\u2019m always a huge fan of auditioning with music that fun and catchy enough that beyond your time in the room, it leaves the person behind the table humming. Sometimes a great tune is just as important as a great performance.\n\n\u201cMarie and Me wanna get together Just like before this world tore us apart Marie and Me, can we make it happen? Lets take a ride make a start\u201d\n\nMore (click to view video)Out Of Context\n\nMichael Patrick Walker is a hugely gifted musical theatre writer who co-wrote the smash hit musical Alter Boyz. This wonderful stand alone song comes the wonderful collection of songs which form his first album \u2018Out Of Context\u2019\n\nWhen asked to choose one of his own songs for auditions, Michael Patrick Walker chose \u2018More\u2019 because:\n\nThis song tells a story without being a \u201cstory song\u201d making it easy to perform the entire thing or do an audition cut without losing too much of the story. Much like my other choice, \u201cMore\u201d allows you to be funny and touching in the same song which is almost always more effective at making an impression than just being \u201cdeeply meaningful\u201d. While written for a male voice, it can be sung by a female voice with only minor adjustments and it is pop enough that it can work for either a pop/rock show or something less modern..\n\nWorking (click to view video)String\n\nThis great little number was cut from the show String by Adam Gwon.\n\nA workaholic Greek god gets tangled up with a security guard in the basement of the tallest building in the world. One mistake leads to another \u2013 a lost pair of scissors, a kiss, a stolen string \u2013 and soon Atropos is breaking her own rules to offer forever to an ordinary man. Can the fabric of the universe stand a flaw? An original musical about the three Fates in the modern city.\n\nHere is why the song\u2019s writer Adam Gwon thinks this song would be a great audition number for a comedy actor:\n\nA short-and-sweet number for a funny guy. Lots of room to make the song your own, with some range-y stuff thrown in in the B section. Also not widely known (it was cut from a show of mine) so chances are you can stand out a little with this one.\n\nThe links here are for Adam Gwon\u2019s CD Ordinary Days but you can buy the sheet music for this particular song here\n\nRandom Black Girl (click to view video)Out Of Our Heads\n\nThis wonderful song comes from Homemade Fusion a song cycle from the wonderful song writing team Kooman and Dimond and the YouTube video featuring Broadway star Patina Miller has had over 100,000 views making it a hit!\n\nHere is what fellow new musical theatre composer Zoe Sarnak has to say about this terrific song:\n\nThis song equally for showing vocals and comedy. Lots of beats, lots of space to show chops. Also, always fun to hear it the room.\n\n\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t I be cast for a part in The Color Purple, \u2018Stead of a random black girl singin\u2019 the soul? My agent gave me advice. Those words I\u2019ll never forget. He said \u201cDon\u2019t think you\u2019ll ever be cast As Eponine or Cossette.\u201d\n\nRock City (click to view video)See Rock City\n\n\u201cSee Rock City and Other Destinations\u201d is a contemporary musical by Brad Alexander and Adam Mathias about connections missed and made at tourist destinations across America. With a score that incorporates pop, rock, folk and more, each story builds on the last to create a vivid travelogue of Americans learning to overcome their fears and expectations in order to connect.\n\nHere is why composer Adam Gwon thinks the title song Rock City makes a great audition number:\n\nThis song will tell me everything I need to know about you very quickly. Can you act? Can you sing? Verse, chorus, check. The verse is easy to endow with some stakes (actors, please give high stakes to any song you perform at an audition!), and the chorus has some badass money notes. I also love listening to this song, so you\u2019d get extra points for that.\n\n\u201cOut there it waits for me Just off I-24 I\u2019ve got to see Rock City Answer to every prayer\u201d\n\nLisa (click to view video)The Black Suits\n\nJoe Iconis is one of my favourite of today\u2019s young musical theatre writers and Lisa is a wonderful example of his fantastic songs \u2013 full of character and storytelling.\n\nThe song is taken from the show The Black Suits: A rock musical about a high school garage band on suburban Long Island trying to win The St. Anne\u2019s Battle of the Bands. The story of two teens and their struggle to learn how to be real friends as the inevitability of adulthood threatens to pull them apart. A musical about dreams, blood, Pop Tarts, records, drug runs, blue hair, the St. Anne\u2019s Battle of the Bands, and the undying transformative coolness of rock and roll music.\n\nI think \u201cLisa\u201d by Joe Iconis works well for an audition song because of its versatility \u2013 I\u2019ve heard it sung by both a guy and a girl. It is very dramatically effective with a beautiful hook and shows off a strong singer. It\u2019s easy to make a great cut out of as well and has a dynamic bridge.\n\nWhen She Smiles (click to view video)Lysistrata Jones\n\nLysistrata Jones is a musical comedy adaptation of Aristophanes\u2019 comedy Lysistrata by Douglas Carter Beane and Lewis Flinn. The show tells the tale of the men on a losing college basketball team whose cheerleader girlfriends refuse to have sex with them until they win a game!\n\nWhen She Smiles is sung by Mick towards the end of the show \u2013 the leading guy, a real jock \u2013 who is thinking of seducing the slightly nerdy poetry loving Robin as a move to win the war against the girls but things don\u2019t go according to plan as she treats him with respect and challenges him to be a better person and awakens something new in him.\n\nSongwriter Kait Kerrigan chose this as one of her top audition picks and has this to say\n\nI heard a girl sing this song in a master class and it felt fresh and young and it surprised and delighted me. Surely, not everyone can pull that off but I love gender-bending in an audition. It shows your confidence. It makes me sit up and pay attention.\n\n\u201cCause when she speaks It\u2019s like my heart just skipped a beat And when she moves It\u2019s like my world is falling thorough It\u2019s when she smiles\u201d\n\nStroke By Stroke (click to view video)Jasper in Deadland\n\nJasper in Deadland is written by the awesome Ryan Scott Oliver. It tells the story of 16-year-old Jasper as he journeys into the afterlife to save his best friend.\n\nThis song is a terrific number as Jasper persuades his afterlife guide Gretchen that life is to be lived not just passed over and hidden from.\n\nMusical theatre composer Will Van Dyke chose this as a great audition song for these reasons:\n\nI\u2019m always a huge fan of auditioning with music that fun and catchy enough that beyond your time in the room, it leaves the person behind the table humming. Sometimes a great tune is just as important as a great performance. For that reason I recommend: Stroke By Stroke by Ryan Scott Oliver.\n\nHere is what Ryan Scott Oliver himself has to say:\n\nwhen you add in the tuneful chorus and its hearty rock chord progression, I think the philosophy is coated in something quite enjoyable and not preachy\u2026 until the listener falls for the song (hopefully) and discovers themselves equally seduced by its rooted, buried philosophical text.\n\nThe links here are for Ryan Scott Oliver\u2019s cd but you can buy the sheet music for this song here\n\n\u201cLet others walk around an ocean, Let others try to build a bridge across. But you and me, we fall in, we fall in Never sure we\u2019ll survive.\u201d\n\nJeff (click to view video)Stand Alone Song\n\nI just love Joe Iconis and his story songs. Most of them would make amazing audition songs and \u2018Jeff\u2019 is a great song for any bold actor who is prepared to make a brave choice at a casting.\n\nHere is what fellow new musical theatre composer Nick Blaemire has to say about this terrific song:\n\nI love Joe\u2019s stuff because it\u2019s so unexpected. This song takes a turn you never see coming, and it may not be appropriate for the stuffier showcases/auditions, but intelligent audiences with a sense of humor will appreciate both the great situation the character is in, and the opportunities it gives the actor who\u2019s playing him.\n\nThe links here are for Joe Iconis\u2019 brilliant CD but you can buy the sheet music for this song here\n\nThe Waiting (click to view video)Relativity\n\nRob Rokicki is a New York based composer, lyricist and performer.\n\nThe song is taken from the Relativity by Rob Rokicki and Michael Ruby. You can\u2019t escape the effects of time\u2026or your family. That\u2019s the concept behind RELATIVITY \u2013 a new pop-rock musical about perspective\u2026about how your points of view on time and family continually change and impact each other\u2026and about discovering what and who are really most important in your life.\n\nHere is why composer Rob Rokicki chooses this as one of his favourite songs (written by himself) for auditioning:\n\nI think my song \u201cThe Waiting\u201d works well because of its versatility. It has drive and dynamic range and shows off acting (both dramatic and humorous). Musically it has nice interval leaps, which can be floated and then mixed/belted to show vocal range. I\u2019ve also heard this song done by a guy or girl.\n\nI\u2019ll Be Here (click to view video)Ordinary Days\n\nI\u2019ll Be Here is taken from the musical Ordinary Days by writer and composer Adam Gwon.\n\nWhen Deb loses the notes to her graduate thesis she unwittingly starts a chain of events that turns the ordinary days of four New Yorkers into something extraordinary.\n\nTold through a series of intricately connected songs and vignettes, Ordinary Days is an original musical about growing up and enjoying the view.\n\nThis song is sung by Claire who is embarking on a new life with her boyfriend Jason, she has had to face her difficult past before she has been able to commit and this truly beautiful song tells her story.\n\nJoshua Salzman and Ryan Cunningham chose \u2018I\u2019ll Be Here\u2019 as a great audition song because:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll Be Here\u201d by Adam Gwon is a wonderfully written story that takes the character on a beautiful emotional journey. It shows the range of the actor and is a gorgeous song to perform and listen to.\n\nHave you ever felt like quitting during a rehearsal process, or spent ages in the evening kicking yourself for not \u2018finding the role\u2019 yet? Its perfectly normal, we all deal with frustration and its perfectly healthy."
