And since only the challenge of self-destruction could interest an omnipotent God, it stands to reason that we... are God's debris.\"\n\nRobert A. Heinlein, Time Enough for Love \"God split himself into a myriad parts that he might have friends. This may not be true, but it sounds good\u0097and is no sillier than any other theology.\"\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nPandeism is a theological theory which proposes that a creator (not necessarily a 'god') created our physical Universe by becoming the Universe. This creator currently exists as an unconscious or otherwise nonintervening (unable to intervene) Energy sustaining all motion in the Universe. Various explanations have been introduced as to why this happened, mostly revolving around the creator needing to learn something through the human experience, or perhaps wishing to experience nonexistence itself. The latter is the device used in Scott Adams' book God's Debris. Variations also speculate as to our purpose, and whether the creator will ever go back to being what it was before, and whether we will have a part in that.\n\nThis position is arrived at through the combination of Deism (the archetype for Have You Seen My God?) and Pantheism (the same for Pieces of God). Not to be confused with Pandaism.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nExamples\n\nopen/close all folders\n\nAnime and Manga\n\nComic Books\n\nLucifer ends with Elaine Belloc, the new omnipotent God , choosing to do this, because having seen how the old way of doing things has gone wrong, and recognising that an omnipotent being should not be personally doing favours for individual people they personally care about at the expense of others, the best way to avoid this is to merge with the universe rather than sit on high and rule it in a top-down way.\n\nFilm\n\nThe Fountain somewhat inaccurately characterizes Mayincatec mythology as \"First Father sacrificed himself for the Tree of Life,\" and so in essence became the world.\n\nSome Pandeists will contend that Pandeism is what's going on in Star Wars \u2014 the source of The Force and such.\n\n\u2014 the source of The Force and such. Oh, God! has George Burns as God giving some surprisingly pandeistic answers to questions from religions leaders. \"The divine truth is not a building or a book or a story. The heart is the temple, where all truth resides\".... \"Jesus was my son, Buddha was my son, Mohammad, Moses, you, the man who said there was no room at the inn was my son. And so is the one who charges $11.00 for a steak in this one\".... \"Everything around them that they can see and smell and feel and hear they should delight in all this. That what is here are some of my very best ideas. And I want everyone to try very hard to make sure that it doesn't all go down the drain.\" Naturally, it might be pointed out that the God of Oh, God! appears as a separate and intervening entity, but Pandeism would simply explain God's appearance (which is in point of fact mundane and lacking in any especially mind-blowing miracles) as a projection of man \u2014 as part of our Creator \u2014 unwittingly reminding himself of some important underlying truths.\n\nThe film version of AKIRA has Tetsuo, in the end becoming a new Big Bang and being reborn as a new Universe.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nLiterature\n\nScott Adams' \"God's Debris\" uses this trope and posits that the creator is wishing to experience nonexistence itself.\n\nThe Survivors, a 1976 novel by Simon Raven, features a character with this belief. One character observes, \"God became the universe. Therefore the universe is God.\" while the other counters \"In becoming the universe God abdicated. He destroyed himself as God. He turned what he had been, his true self, into nullity and thereby forfeited the Godlike qualities which pertained to him. The universe which he has become is also his grave. He has no control in it or over it. God, as God, is dead.\"\n\nCritic Dan Schneider suggests this theory to be the one at work in Robert A. Heinlein's Stranger in a Strange Land, as the basis of Valentine Michael Smith's created religion.\n\nOne of Lazarus Long's aphorisms from Heinlein's Time Enough for Love: \"God split himself into a myriad parts that he might have friends. This may not be true, but it sounds good, and is no sillier than any other theology.\"\n\nThis is how universes are created in Alan Dean Foster's Glory Lane. A god-like being commits suicide which creates another universe with another godlike being made of dark matter who commits suicide again, creating another universe and another god-like dark matter being and so-on ad infinitum.\n\nThe Jack Kerouac novel Desolation Angels comments about how we are bits of a Universe which decided to become us and then forget it had become us: \"And you have been forever, and will be forever, and all the worrisome smashings of your foot on innocent cupboard doors it was only the Void pretending to be a man pretending not to know the Void....\"\n\nAlfred Tennyson personally identified as a Pandeist, and this theological underpinning influenced much of his nature poetry.\n\nPoet Ferndano Pessoa has been identified by literary critics as a Pandeist as well.\n\nJorge Luis Borges hints this way in \"Tl\u00f6n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius \", and moreso in \"Otras inquisiciones\" (1952): \"El tiempo es la sustancia de que estoy hecho. El tiempo es un r\u00edo que me arrebata, pero yo soy el r\u00edo; es un tigre que me destroza, pero yo soy el tigre; es un fuego que me consume, pero yo soy el fuego. El 'mundo, desgraciadamente, es real; yo, desgraciada\u00admente, soy Borges.\" (\"Time is the substance from which I am made. Time is a river which carries me along, but I am the river; it is a tiger that devours me, but I am the tiger; it is a fire that consumes me, but I am the fire. The 'world, unfortunately, is real, I, unfortunately, am Borges.\") Borges wrote sympathetically of Philipp Mainl\u00e4nder: \"Like me, he was an impassioned reader of Schopenhauer, under whose influence (and perhaps under the influence of the Gnostics) he imagined that we are fragments of a God who destroyed Himself at the beginning of time, because He did not wish to exist. Universal history is the obscure agony of those fragments.\"\n\nOne of the characters in William Peter Blatty's Legion suggests an interesting twist on this idea: the Universe did not arise from God tearing Himself apart, but of another entity created by God \u2014 who tore himself apart of his own free will, out of a desire to experience space and time and to explore physical existence. Every sentient being is a piece of this entity, attempting to learn more about himself and his relation to the Infinite; human good and evil is a manifestation of the good and evil that lay within the entity. The character comes up with a name for this entity: Lucifer, who was both the fallen angel and the Bringer of Light.\n\nReligious writer Neale Donald Walsch espouses a pandeistic understanding of our Universe, and of man being the experience of God.\n\nMany books along the lines of The Master Key System and The Secret fundamentally presume a pandeistic Universe, wherein man is able to unlock seemingly divine capacities by dint of our Universe being the unconscious existence of our Creator.\n\nCities in Flight: The final section (Triumph Of Time) has several characters decide to have themselves thrown 'outside' of the universe \u2014 it's going to temporarily cross \"through\" another universe; they (most likely) won't survive the process \u2014 in space suits packed with explosives. The expectation is setting off the explosives would allow each character to become a personalized \"big bang\", with the resultant baby universes having their physical constants being 'seeded' by the constants contained within each astronaut.\n\nMythology\n\nChinese Mythology: Pangu is a human man born in nothing ness, and he separated the sky and the earth, then died, and his body parts became everything on the world.\n\nLive-Action TV\n\nThe Minbari religion from Babylon 5 can be summarized as this. In one episode, Delann describes it thusly: \"We believe that the Universe itself is conscious in a way we can never truly understand; it is engaged in a search for meaning, so it breaks itself apart, investing its own consciousness in every form of life. We are the Universe trying to understand itself.\" In another episode, Delenn tells John that if they die, they will reunite \"in the place where no shadows fall\" because \"all come together in the same place, at the end of time.\"\n\n\n\nTabletop Games\n\nVideo games\n\nIn Grim Dawn A Darker and Edgier take on it. The blood of Ch'thon, the Dying God was used to create all mortal life in the Grim Dawn universe. But he feels all the pain that they feel and has been driven mad by it.\n\nWebcomics\n\nIn Kill Six Billion Demons, the god YISUN grew weary of having an infinite existence, and thus committed suicide by splitting itself into many lesser aspects. In White Chain's words, \"It was a wretched life, without meaning or perception. Imagine infinite stories to tell, Allison, and nobody to tell them to. \"\n\nReal Life\n\nScores of historical philosophers have been associated with pandeistic views by various historians of philosophy, including Xenophanes of Colophon, Heraclitus of Ephesus, Chrysippus, Scotus Eriugena, Bonaventure, Nicholas of Cusa, Franciscus Mercurius van Helmont, Giordano Bruno, Anselm of Canterbury, Victor Cousin, and Friedrich Engels.\n\nSome expressions of Hinduism delve in this direction, though this is most often through Western interpretation of Hindu doctrine.\n\nNASA astrophysicist Bernard Haisch proposes a theological model in his book The God Theory which has an infinite God becoming an infinite number of Universes to actualise its experience of all forms of existence; human consciousness is simply a filtered fragment of the now-sublimated consciousness of this God.\n\nLiteral, self-proclaimed pandeists. Probably the most noted is Alfred Tennyson. Another is adventurer Bruce Parry.\n\nTropes about Pandeism itself:\n\nPerfect Pacifist People : Justified on the belief that violence committed against another person is actually committed against the Creator; which means, ultimately, against the self.\n\nPieces of God: Everything is.\n\nPuff of Logic: The view taken by Pandeism as to theistic beliefs \u2014 as Pandeism is based on logic, and claims to account for all phenomena upon which other faiths are premised without requiring additional divine capacities, it is asserted to logically supersede all faiths which do require such capacities.\n\nReincarnation: Some versions have it, some don't, but all suppose at least that we are pieces of God, and probably that we will at some point be reassembled into God.\n\nSentient Cosmic Force: In some strains of pandeistic thought.\n\nTake a Third Option: Splits the line between atheism and theism. Or between Pantheism and Deism, which already both sort of do that.\n\nThe Omniscient: Variable within the varying schools of thought of the belief, but generally exists at least to the extent that the Creator, having become the Creation, instantly and completely experiences everything which happens within such Creation. But since the Creator is fully occupied with existing as the Creation, it can do nothing to change what is happening or will happen. The notion that the Creator knows future happenings is explicitly denied on the grounds that this would eliminate any rational basis for setting forth a Creation at all.\n\nWho Wants to Live Forever?: One possible reason why a God would cease to be a God and become a Universe instead.\n\nYou Cannot Grasp the True Form: Those who are somehow able to contact the mind of our Creator as it unconsciously underlies our Universe find that experience so incomprehensible that their tiny human minds automatically defend themselves by interpreting such encounters as intentional communications from culturally familiar conceptions of gods, thereby explaining all revelation and scripture.\n\nYour Mind Makes It Real: Miracles, seemingly answered prayers, and revelations occur across multiple faiths because the Universe-creating entity has become us (and the rest of the Universe) and believers in any religion are able to unwittingly tap into their own little slice of Creator-power.\n\nUseful links"
