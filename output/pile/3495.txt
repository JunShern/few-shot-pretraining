    "text": "XFL NEEDS SOME OLD-FASHIONED IMPROVEMENTS\n\nTHE HARTFORD COURANT\n\nAs of this writing, the NBC-World Wrestling Federation experiment with XFL football is a bit of a flop -- failing, but not yet taken out back and shot in the head. The television ratings stink, but so does the analysis that attempts to explain the problem.\n\nTo suggest that the XFL is too violent, too sex-obsessed and too tacky is exactly the wrong diagnosis -- a diagnosis produced by big-brained pundits who drink white wine and go to PTA meetings with their wives.\n\nThe problem with the XFL isn't that it's too over-the-top. It has failed to catch on because it's too tame, it's too normal, it's too much like the grown-up National Football League -- but without the great players.\n\nFor all the hype about how violent and smash-mouth the XFL was going to be, the honest truth is that the XFL players aren't stupid: a little snarling and hard tackling is OK, but they're not going to maim each other for $45,000 per year and the admiration of the beer-guzzling guys in the stands.\n\nThe football fields aren't filled with ambulances and body bags.\n\nAnd for all the hype about how sexy/slutty the cheerleaders were going to be, in the end, they sort of look and act like blue-collar versions of suburban soccer-mom joggers who strut their stuff on public streets. Letting us get a peek in the cheerleaders' locker room is cute, but you can flip to a cable channel and watch marathon copulation. A bit of cheerleader breast or butt isn't going to inflame the populace -- at least the segment over 10 years old.\n\nEfforts to energize the game, including worthwhile stuff like eliminating the dumb extra-point kick after touchdowns, haven't freed the league from the NFL obsession with robot-like conservatism, leading to few \"mistakes,\" but also to little offense or fun or novelty.\n\nFirst, shake off the new and bring back the old. XFL teams should spring a little single-wing football on us. Back in the good old days, the single-wing was what brought us crashing, crunching, stop-me-if-you-dare football, with reverses and spins and quick kicks for no reason at all and a tailback designed to be a running, passing, kicking, triple-threat hero. The old guys in the audience will swoon with the nostalgia of it all -- and the young drunks will think the \"new\" offense is really cool.\n\nAnd you don't even need the single wing to offer up such weird stuff as the flea-flicker and the statue-of-liberty and the onside kick -- the kind of fun stuff that shows up in the NFL once every three years.\n\nIn the successful pro wrestling venue, the crowd is an active part of the show, with a rather sweaty and nearby connection with the gladiators in the ring. The XFL can grab a piece of that action by encouraging fans to call or fax or e-mail suggested offensive plays to the home teams, which the coach would be required to choose from and use once or twice during the games.\n\nThe University of Nebraska at Kearney has experimented with an approach like that, as has Boise State and, in the NFL pro ranks, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Let me call in a game-winning play, give me a little on-air credit, and I'll watch the XFL forever -- or until I pass out drinking whatever brand of beer is being advertised.\n\nAnd the girls. Those cheerleaders will never be as nutty or slutty as what a 5-year-old can call up on the Internet. The football producers have to remember the lessons of pro wrestling: The key to a good time is a plot, a script, a story line.\n\nThe cheerleaders should be allowed to participate in the huddles, to encourage the boys to win one for Wanda. Let Virginia the Virgin and Terry the Tramp flirt with the players during the game; let them throw garter belts and swoon when some Cohen-like hunk does something particularly heroic.\n\nThe last thing that the XFL should do is listen to the stuffy critics who think that lowbrow football is too lowbrow. If you want to criticize mediocre, tacky, oversexed junk, take a look at what the National Endowment for the Arts offers up as high culture."
