Is there any preferred method for doing this?\nI've searched on Google and I just keep getting a lot of 3rd party software vendors selling addon software but I can't seem to find any useful guides or tutorials for doing this.\n\nA:\n\nThere are only two (decent) solutions that I know of - the first being a little more decent than the second.\n\niSpring offers a free version of\ntheir PowerPoint to Flash converter called iSpringFree.\nIt's decent. I use the Pro version\nbecause I also have a need to add\ne-Learning/SCORM functionality - but\nif you don't have that need, it\nshould be fine. In general, it also\none of the better converters out\nthere (amongst a host of many\npay-for PPT->SWF converters).\nYou could open your PPT/PPTX in\nOpenOffice.org's Impress and then\nExport to Flash format.\n\nHaving server-side triggered conversion is a little more tricky - I don't know of a server-side component other than they pay-for SDK solution by iSpring that offers this. The two above are for manual conversion.\n\n"
