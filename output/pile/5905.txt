    "text": "Q:\n\ngenes with highest RPKM/FPKM for a human RNA-seq experiment?\n\nWhich genes/transcripts show up as having the highest RPKM/FPKM on a human RNA-seq experiment? Is it usually the same genes/transcripts?\nEDIT: mRNAs (e.g. poly-A RNA-seq preps) and not including small RNAs.\n\nA:\n\nAs asked as it is, the answer is probably no.\nIndeed, the highest expressed RPKM/FPKMs will be different from one condition (or tissue) to another one for example.\nThen, you may also have technical artefacts due to the wet-lab part or to the normalisation. For example, mitochondrial genes are often reported in the top expressed genes.\nNow, if you want to compare your results to an outside source, I recommend checking the EBI gene expression Atlas* and more specifically the Baseline expression experiments.\nPro-tips:\n\nYou can filter the genes based on their nature (eg, mRNA) and/or their expression.\nYou can also visualise the overall expression of a specific gene across several experiments.\n\n*Disclaimer: I am related to this project myself.\n\n"
