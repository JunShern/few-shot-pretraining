    "text": "Babatunde Olatunji\n\nInterview by Jason Gross (October 2000)\n\nThirty-two years ago, African music made a huge dent\ninto the Western market. Nigerian drummer Babatunde Olatunji's ensemble\nheard on Drums of Passion not only was released on a major label\nbut became a top 10 record in America. Though it was many decades this\noccurred before the 'world music' explosion, it shouldn't have been that\nmuch of a surprise that this comparatively minimal music would make such\nan impact in the States. Even at that time, folklorists and historians\nhad recognized the enormous debt that homegrown styles like blues and jazz\nowed to African music and its rhythms.\n\nOlatunji was much more than a gifted, groundbreaking\nartist. By the time that his music was making the charts, he was also making\nthe lecture circuit, going around colleges to talk about African culture.\nHe also decided to create his own arts center to promote the work of other\nmusicians and teach young people about music. His work schedule was punishing\nbut Olatunji was tireless: from 1968 to 1982, he taught at Roxbury (Massachusetts)\ntwo days a week then teaching two days a week a class at Kent State and\nthen traveling back to New York for the weekends to teach at his own school.\n\nHis quest has spanned to today and found him many\nmusicians as supporters (and collaborators) of his work, including John\nColtrane, Carlos Santana, Taj Mahal and the Grateful Dead. His latest album,\nLove\nDrum Talk (on Chesky,\n1997) earned him a Grammy nomination and a new generation of admirers.\nI met Olatunji in April 1999 to talk about the span of his career.\n\nSpecial thanks to Olatunji enthusiast Maureen 'Moe'\nTucker for her encouragement.\n\n2003 update: Sad news as Baba passed away in California on April 6th at the age of 76 from diabetes. He will be missed and he will be remembered.\n\nPSF: Before you came to America, when you were growing\nup in Nigeria, how did your interests and studies with music begin?\n\nI grew up in a village where music was a way of life.\nEveryday you wake up and you may be celebrating the birth of a child, the\ncoming of age of a young man or woman, someone taking a giant step in life\n(getting married) or someone passing into the spirit world. All of this\nis celebrated with music and chants and dance. I would say that music covers\nall the vicissitudes of life. So you grow up as a child seeing all of this\nand being part of it. There's no way of escaping it. It's just like any\nyoung man here in America will wake up at any time during the summer and\ncan grab a baseball bat or pick up a basketball and play around with it.\nIt's one thing to know something about it but becoming Michael Jordan is\nanother thing.\n\nI grew up with that and my interests grew up with\nthat. In retrospect, I remember very well that I was always on the side\nwhere the musicians were instead of where the audience was at all festivals.\nEvery weekend there was a festival in the villages. You are just there\nand you are a part of it. But for me, I would always stand where the musicians,\nthe drummers were. I remember that very well.\n\nPSF: Who were some of these musicians who influenced\nyou early on?\n\nMaster drummers, griots whose daily life involved\npreserving the culture. These are really professional musicians whom you\nwould see at all the occasions that I mentioned.\n\nPSF: What was it about their work that made you want\nto do it yourself?\n\nI noticed that people paid them respect and gave\nthem a tremendous amount of attention for what they did. They acknowledged\ntheir presence and really had a place for them in society. Those who wake\nup every day to play music, those who go to the marketplaces to perform\nwhere the women sell their wares, those are the professional musicians.\nThose are the historians. Those are the people who through their songs,\nyou can really write the history of a city, about the movers and the shakers\nin the city or people who are legendary, people who are great, people who\ndid good work and those who did bad also. Through the songs that they write,\nyou can learn about people who make contributions to society. I was so\nfascinated by them.\n\nThere was one particular griot called Denge. He was\nlike one who would sing about kings and chiefs, remind them of their upbringing,\nremind them of the great contributions that their ancestors gave and make\nsure that they follow tradition. He was very, very cool.\n\nPSF: This was probably before radio or television\nentered the picture so they were probably an equivalent form of entertainment\nalso, right?\n\nNo radio, no TV. (There were) social events that\nfollowed each other in succession in our daily lives. There's always a\nchild being born in the village. There's always someone getting married\nin the next town and you hear about it and people go to it. These are events\nthat are announced by word of mouth.\n\nPSF: What led you to come to the United States in\nthe 1950's?\n\nLuckily, by divine right, both of us (his brother\nalso) won the Rotary Educational Scholarship in 1950. That's how we came\nto the United States, to go to Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia. We\nwere overwhelmed when we came here. (laughs) Really, it wasn't what we\nthought it was or all of things that we read about it. We were very na\u00efve\nabout the social situation, the race relation situation. We went to school\nin the South. At our arrival at Morehouse Campus, which is a black college,\nwe saw some people who looked like people we knew at home. They would tell\nus \"No, we're not from Africa.\" I'd tell them \"you look just like my cousin\"\nand they'd say \"no way!\"\n\nWe went through all that whole period of trying to\neducate our brothers and sisters about their African heritage. That's how\nthe whole thing started with me as a lecturer.\n\nI was studying political science to become a diplomat.\nI changed though. When I came to New York, I went to the New York University\nGraduate School of Public Administration and International Relations. But\nthat was a period when social change was going on in the process and I\nwas a part of that. I was the one who was called to present African programs\nfor Black awareness for NAACP and other groups. There was a good response\nto this. I performed at these events throughout the sixties.\n\nPSF: What led to you getting the chance to record\nan album?\n\nThe way the whole situation started was that I had\nbeen in a situation where before I left Morehouse college, I had established\nmyself in a way of letting it be known that this is a cultural basis for\nour unity. I did this by presenting African music and dance while at Morehouse.\nI wanted to create the true image of African- not Tarzan or the Hollywood\nimage. So upon graduation, I planned to continue the same thing. When I\ncame to New York, I started going about lecturing in schools.\n\nIn 1956, I contributed to the first UNICEF recording\nfor children. I had a sponsor who was teaching history in Boston and we\nrecorded it when he returned. The UN Choir was singing at a party for New\nYear's Eve, which I went to. I was asked to do a chant and the choir director\nsaid 'Ooh, that voice!'\n\nI was introduced to a man at Radio City (Music Hall),\nRaymond White, the arranger for their Symphony Orchestra. I went there\nand met him and (we) collaborated- we did a 12-minute piece called \"African\nDrum Fantasy\" in 1958. That was my biggest break. Before that, I had been\nat schools lecturing and performing African music and dance, talking about\nhe rich cultural heritage of Africa as related to blues, jazz, gospel singing.\nI was there (Radio City) for seven weeks, four shows a day with the Symphony\nOrchestra. It was reviewed by all the daily newspapers there of the day.\n\nIt was then that Al Han, artists representative of\nColumbia Records, came to me and said 'We'll put you in the studio.' That\nwas the recording of Drums of Passion. It was number 13 on the Billboard\ncharts. It was the first African recording that really demonstrated the\nimpact of percussion in music.\n\nPSF: Do you feel that there are medicinal powers\nin your music?\n\nPossibly. We are now experiencing and trying to discover\nhow it works. We use our instruments to bring people together. We know\nthat it will always do that. The instruments that we use in Africa are\nsources of communication. The other aspect of it is that we use it for\nhealing. That's an important aspect of drumming in African music, the polyrhythmic\nnature. We know that rhythm is the soul of life. Every cell in your body\nand mine is in constant frequency, in rhythm. Everything that we do is\nin rhythm. So that music, it attracts, it energizes every cell in our body.\nWe're trying to find the answers of how music can be used to heal. We will\ncome to it somehow, but words are not adequate to describe how you feel,\nif you are tired or if you feel competitive. But once you start, the adrenaline\nflows, you become more energetic, you feel something flowing through your\nwhole body. You can't say what it is but it is something powerful. You\nfeel in excess of it.\n\nThat's what happens. That aspect of it is what I\nknow that has come to maintain the validity of that. But we know it heals.\nIt heals. So for me personally, it has helped me, healed me through many,\nmany conditions. I know that if it effect me, it effects others. Definitely.\n\nPSF: You were talking about how African music informed\nother styles. When you were playing with jazz musicians such as John Coltrane,\nwhat kind of common thread did you find between your work and theirs?\n\nIn talking about jazz, you call it a phenomenon that\nhas been born from so many sources. Africa's contribution to jazz is rhythm.\nThe jazz musician (like Coltrane) with their hands, do improvisation. With\nthat going on, there is a steady beat, a heartbeat. The same thing in singing-\ncall and response as you have in gospel. \"Oh happy day, happy day.\" You\nhave African rhythms, revisions of African traditions.\n\nIn the way of life of people in the area of arts,\nit's the same thing when you think about it. People who are very, very\neloquent in the sense when you go through times like Ozzy Davis, people\nwho are natural at things. People who can recite verses. People who have\nmemory retention. The style of presentation. You have blues singers who\nthrough their songs, tell stories about their lifestyle or the lifestyle\nof the people they deal with and what is happening in their immediate environment,\nhow they feel about life in general. What is their emotional feelings about\nsubject matters like love, like pain, like wealth, like death and God?\nThrough their songs, through their renditions, they let this all out. And\nhow they feel about the one that gives them the most pleasure. That's an\nAfrican tradition that has survived the test of time. It's something that\nwill carry on.\n\nAs you move from North America to South America,\nthe retention of African tradition even becomes more powerful than it is\nin North America. The continents were not really separated as they were\nwith North America. So if go to Surinam, you can see a whole village of\nnothing but Guyanians who are carving the same way that they are doing\nin Surinam. If you go to Trinidad, you can listen to people who are chanting\nthe same songs to the God of thunder as they do in Nigeria. If you go to\nthe oriental province in Cuba, where Mongo Santamaria came from, they have\nthe same way of live and the same way of talking is practically the same\nthing as a Guinea tribe. The same thing in Guyana, the South Sea Islands.\nIt's all over. That's how the contribution of African culture, development\nof world culture, has been very tremendous.\n\nPSF: Talk about how you present your albums as part\nof a cycle.\n\nThe first one was actually a signature to let people\nknow what African percussion is all about. We put it together to make music.\nIt really speaks for itself. What I am hoping to be do\u2026 You know, for twenty-eight\nyears, I didn't collect any royalties. I was so excited that when I signed\nthe contract, I didn't read it! (laughs) I didn't cross the T's and dot\nthe I's!\n\nIt's like seeing a vision of what's going to happen.\nThat's why I changed course, foreseeing the whole idea of diplomacy that\nI was studying for. At that appearance at Radio City in 1958, I had been\nhere eight years and in 1957, Ghana became independent. I was getting 500\ndollars a week so I was able to save money. I was invited to a very important\nmeeting in Ghana- the All African Peoples Conference held by President\nKwame Nkrumah in 1958. So I was able to go Ghana- that's when I was elected\nPresident of the Student's Union (at Morehouse). I was very political in\nthose days. I had a degree in diplomacy so I had to organize African students\nfrom all over.\n\nI went to that meeting and read a paper at the conference.\nI was a non-voting member because I was a student. In essence, I said that\nthere should be a cultural center in every major city in America so as\nto disseminate information about the rich cultural heritage of Africa to\ncorrect the ugly image of Africa in the mind of Americans. The President\napplauded the speech and the next day, he called me and my wife to his\ncastle. He said 'that was a great thing- why don't you just pursue that\n(drumming)? We will be able to help you.' So the first drum set I had for\nDrums\nOf Passion actually came from Ghana. I didn't have money to buy drums\nin those days. I was just leeching around, using a few conga drums that\nI rented. I didn't get that set until years after I graduated from college\nin New York in 1954. This was four years later!\n\nDrums Of Passion was the first album. I didn't\nknow that I would get a contract but we would rehearse every day, Monday\nthrough Sunday. Those who say they were gonna charge us, they say 'when\nyou're finished charging, you come over here.' This group was mainly African-Americans,\nsome from the islands. We came together and we were a very unique group-\nthey were interested and eager. That was the beginning of it. From there,\nit became a necessary way of life with me to pursue and looking for support\nfrom abroad and from here. That led to the establishment of the Olatunji\nCenter of African Culture.\n\nIt was all the period when the late Alvin Alley would\nwatch us rehearse. That was before he started his company. We would present\nmodern jazz groups and they perform with us. We started the Olatunji Center\nin Harlem then (1967). That was our first home- the center had been operating\nbut without a specific home, using different spaces. Before that, we formed\nat the World's Fair, 1964, 1965. We were the first African group in this\ncountry to perform at the World's Fair. The audience at the African pavilion\nwas the most popular one at the Fair. The money I made there, I used to\nopen the Center. I couldn't buy a building though so I had to pay $15,000\na year for to rent a loft space. Coltrane was one person who was sending\n$250 every month to help. Then later on, he did not perform for two years\nand the last performance he gave was where? At my center. He was very concerned\nabout the way that promoters were cheating the musicians. They go and borrow\nmoney from their cousins. They would play at Carnegie Hall and make $50,000\nfor the show and then they pay them (musicians) scale wages. It was unequal\ndistribution of wealth.\n\nSo he (Coltrane) said, 'I want to deal with this\nand do some research and see where I am, learn what I can learn about Western\nmusic and jazz.' He was following me at that time. He came to me and said\n'you and me and several other people like ourselves should come together.\nWe know how to promote shows. How about three groups? You want to have\na center in every center in America? We can do that? Your group, my group\nand Yusef's (Lateef) group can start with Lincoln Center and we'll raise\nenough money.' I was appointed Secretary-treasurer. I went and booked the\nfirst concert for January 1968. Trane passed in 1967 though.\n\nThe center was also there for the purpose of bringing\nback what I read about Harlem. Things were so different. You had black\nand white (people) everywhere. So I was wondering why it wasn't happening\nagain? So I instituted a Sunday afternoon program called 'Roots of Africa'-\nthe program had a picture of Africa with Coltrane in the middle. So we\nperformed, Yusef performed, Pete Seeger performed, Bill Lee (Spike Lee's\nfather) performed with eight bass players. That hasn't been done again.\nIt was done right there at the center. It was really going well. I had\nsomebody different every Sunday afternoon, all for two dollars! That's\nit! (laughs) I had been surviving without any foundation support. I would\nwrite for grants, do proposals and hear back from the Ford Foundation 'we\ndo not fund your kind of program.' The first money I got was from the Rockefeller\nbrothers: 25,000.\n\nThen from the National Endowment of the Arts, we\ngot a grant for our teacher training program. So most of the most of people\nyou see teaching African dance were trained there. We went to all over\nthe schools in the tri-state area, all the way to Long Island.\n\nThat's where I met Mickey Hart (Grateful Dead). He\nwas at one of the schools where they had the African program. I always\nasked the students to come and beat on the drums. He came and did it and\nI said \"He's good!\" That was 25 years ago. It wasn't until November 1985\nin San Francisco that I met him again at one of the Bill Graham theatres.\nMickey was coming from a (basketball) game and he brought Larry Bird to\nmeet me after the show. He was helping with the sound and the whole place\nwas dancing with drums. He said \"You don't remember me but I want to tell\nyou something... It's because of you that I'm doing what I'm doing today.\nWhat are you doing tomorrow?\" I didn't have any plans. So he says \"OK,\nyou're going to open for the Grateful Dead.\" That was December 1985. It\nwas at that time that Columbia refused to renew my contract. That was George\nButler- he might have recognized that I'm a legend but he didn't go for\nmy kind of music. I said \"You told me that my first record wouldn't sell\nand you know it did!\"\n\nPSF: Could you talk about the other bands and performances\nyou were doing at clubs during the 1960's?\n\nI started experimenting back then, when I started.\nI had my jazz combo and we used to have 12-13 weeks at Birdland (New York).\nWe used to open for all the big bands. We would also close out the shows\nat 4AM. In 1960, 1961, you had the bands like Count Basie, Duke Ellington,\nQuincy Jones. I got to meet a lot of the Europeans too because when they\ncame to New York, they'd arrive late. And where would they go then? Birdland.\nIt was a fascinating period.\n\nThen for a ten-year period, nothing was happening\nfor me. The Center closed because we kept missing the rent. I didn't get\nany support from the city. They could have given me a building for one\ndollar because we were non-profit. None of the middle-class blacks gave\nany support for my effort. They did not send their kids to my school. I\npicked up kids that used to sell drugs in Harlem just to (earn money to)\ncome upstairs and drum. I didn't get ANY support. It was humiliating. It\nwas so devastating that here was an opportunity to help these people to\nhave an image of themselves. They were talking about kids not doing the\nright thing. But they didn't do the right thing by them. I used to walk\nbetween 126th Street to 138th Street and I saw that those kids didn't go\nschool. They walked around, had nowhere to go. So I took them upstairs\nand had them play drums. I was charging two dollars and I wasn't just teaching\nthem about drums. I was teaching them history, culture and I offered them\n12 languages. The history about themselves. If they ever knew who their\nancestors where, they would want to do the right thing.\n\nBut they (the parents and adults) didn't do anything\nabout the situation. I think the same thing is still going on now. The\nanswer is not spending millions of dollars to go on television and tell\npeople \"JUST SAY NO.\" That's not the answer. You got to do what Malcolm\n(X) said. He put it in the street language- \"Stop it downtown and it won't\ncome uptown.\" You know who the people are who are bringing these things\nin- those are the people you need to stop. You need to fortify the borders\nso that no one can bring any drugs in.\n\nPSF: Did you find any support among the colleges?\n\nIntegration came on college campuses where I used\nto go all over the world. I was being sponsored by the entire university.\nNow, the black student unions would want to sponsor me but they don't have\nno money. It's black backlash that I experienced. I used to go to Kent\nState to perform three times a year. Now, I can only go once because the\nstudent union can't afford it. The black student union gets very little\nmoney and they want to do so much. They can only pay me a fraction of what\nI was getting before to tie the drums to our car and drive all the way\nout there. We used to do that- drive all around the country in those days.\nIt was devastating. It was so heart-breaking to see what was going on in\nthose days. But now, everyone is playing drums.\n\nPSF: In your groups, how do the drums communicate\nwith each other and interweave with the singers?\n\nThe African theatre is a total theatre. You cannot\nwrite a dramatic play without song and without movement. The trial is lost\nif you have a presentation that does not address ALL aspects of the music.\nThe dancers must be able to dance with the beat of the drum. The drummers\nwho play for the dancers must have knowledge of the dance. That's the only\nway that they're going to be able to play adequately and professionally.\nThat's how they will be able to communicate with them.\n\nNot until recent times have I been noticing in Western\ntheatre, in Broadway shows, the people who audition must be able to sing,\ndance and act. That was never a problem with an African performance. Automatically,\nhe or she is trained right from the start to be able to combine all of\nthose parts together. This is no sense in the whole presentation that the\ndrummer does not know the dance. He must know the dance- the required changes\nnecessary in the choreography of the dance. Not only in tempo, in intensity,\nmaybe to a completely new interpretation.\n\nIn the other words, the dancer and the drummer have\nbecome one. The drummer as well as the dancer has the ability to sing along\nas they perform. It is part of the whole presentation. That is normally\ntaught from the beginning of any particular presentation or production.\n\nPSF: Do you also have a sense that the drums are\ninteracting with each other?\n\nThe drummers between themselves are interacting and\ncommunicating. Irrespective of the number of drummers involved in a presentation,\neach drummer is given a part to play for the whole. He must know where\nthe change is from one part to the next. That's (been) happening for thousands\nof years.\n\nA lot of people go about teaching African dance but\nthey don't teach the music. They just play for the dance. Every traditional\ndance that's been passed on from time immortal is all music, unless it\nis a new work. So (then) you got to write the music for it. New choreography,\nnew music, new costumes. But the interaction among the drummers is very\nclear that you don't jump into playing rhythmic patterns unless there is\na reason or the group can help bring you back as a reminder to say 'this\nis what you're supposed to be playing.' All the musicians know the parts,\nincluding the part of the lead drummer.\n\nPSF: I had heard that you performed at a celebration\nhere for Nelson Mandela. Could you talk about that?\n\nThere were 120 clergyman at Riverside Church of all\ndenominations in the community. They had a special service for Mandela\nwhen he first came here (1990). It was my group that led him into the church,\nwith the drums and the chants. I led him to his seat and then performed.\nFrom there, the group also performed at the reception given to him at Yankee\nStadium. I also followed him out to San Francisco, which was also organized\nby Bill Graham. I am looking forward to going back to San Francisco to\ndiscuss a project, the Voices of Africa.\n\nPSF: How has it felt to be an expatriate here in\nthe States, playing the music from your homeland and occasionally going\nback there to perform?\n\nWell, I'm a citizen of the world now. I am very concerned\nabout what has been happening in Africa. What I've been doing here... I\nwanted to repeat (my) performance in Africa. I want to be going around\nnow, reminding people that in our quest to become totally free as we pursue\nour goals, we need to remember and put into place all of the traditional\nwisdom that will help us survive in the new millennium. We need to re-institute\nsome of our traditional values that seem to be evaporating in our society\nnow. That is to restore our traditional ways of life in the areas of culture,\nmusic, arts that has helped us define what we call the African personality.\n\nIn my estimation, we are in an educational pursuit.\nIn the Western world, we have neglected those traditional values. So it's\nwhat I call 'misplacement of values.' Unless we go back to restoring them\ninto our lives, we're going to have trouble- a lot of misgivings among\nour own people in the very near future. A lot of young people are clamoring\nnow to find out 'what is it that we can call our own? What is it about\nour heritage?' They want to know. These times now make them very, very\naware of that.\n\nPSF: Do you see your work as carrying on tradition\nand bringing a message to people?\n\nThat's exactly what I'm so grateful about. I may\nnot have any money to show about it but what I have started here, from\nfive years ago, is like planting a new seed that is beginning to germinate.\nIt will come out very well. I'm quite sure that the leadership will become\nvery, very concerned about the need for looking into the past. The past\nand the present are inevitably put together. What we had in the past is\nwhat we have today- it will make a wonderful combination for tomorrow.\nThen we cannot let time go by without taking care of that particular aspect\nof our development now, especially if we try to patch up the rest of the\nworld.\n\nIf we're really going to catch up, as they say, he\nwho is behind must run faster than he who is in front. That's if you want\nto catch up. And we need to catch up with the rest of the world. Africa\nneeds a very strong leadership, compassionate leadership. We need someone\nwho will really want to serve the people. You have to be tolerant and be\nable to listen and do the right thing by the people.\n\nYou look at this country and how they spend all the\nmoney buying arms. Who are we trying to fight? They spend 12 million dollars\nto save 1 million people in Rwanda. Why didn't they raise that money years\nago to prevent what happened there? The military annulled the election\nand go away with it and we were doing business with a tyrant.\n\nPSF: How do you think your work has evolved?\n\nThe music has not changed, but it has evolved. I\nhad been able to incorporate my musical experiences in different CD's and\nalbums. I have always had a message. At the same time, (I) make sure that\nthe foundation of what I'm presenting is still tradition. My recent album,\nthe subject matter is love. I let traditional percussion music be very,\nvery strong there. It was overpowered by other instruments. I wanted people\nto experience how it could be done without the use of synthesizers and\nhard rock instrumentation. There's always a message about each CD that\nI put out. So, I have been very careful about that. I think every student\nof African music, even Africans themselves, needs to make sure that we\ndon't lose that touch. We should really maintain the roots, the strong\nbackground that we have. That our performances really be a signature of\nwhere the roots of the music come from.\n\nThere is no doubt in my mind (that) we all go through\na process of incorporation. No matter who you are or where you are, you\nwill be effect by an environment. But nevertheless, you cannot afford to\nlose yourself. Being how you are. I will always make sure that you have\na taste of that particular instrument, the drum.\n\nPSF: And the voice too.\n\nYes, of course.\n\nPSF: You have a very impressive range.\n\nWell, I am proud of that. I had attended a session\nwith a voice teacher from Boston who had trained many singers and politicians.\nSo I sang for him \" Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do!\" He said \"what a voice- what\nconservatory did you study at?\" I said \"Conservatory? I studied in the\nbush! The village was my conservatory.\""
