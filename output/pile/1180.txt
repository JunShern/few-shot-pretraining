    "text": "#GameOfThrones finale prediction: Arya already killed Petyr Baelish\n\nGame of Thrones opened season seven with misdirection. Walder Frey, fresh off being fed his children and killed at the end of season six, stood to welcome \u201cevery Frey who means a damn thing\u201d to his second feast of the fortnight. We were confused. Didn\u2019t we just see Arya open his throat?\n\nWe did. But this was not Walder Frey. It was no one. It was the lone wolf. It was Arya Stark in Walder Frey\u2019s dead face.\n\n\u201cWhen they ask you what happened here, tell them the north remembers. Tell them winter came for House Frey.\u201d\n\nThis show is too good to open a season with that scene and not call back to it. Seasons have their own arc, and I believe the arc of season seven will be Arya Stark revealing herself as the killer of Petyr Baelish.\n\n\u2026unless he\u2019s not fooling anyone because Arya already slit his throat with the Valryian steel dagger he gave to Bran.\n\n2. Sansa saw the dagger when she snuck into Arya\u2019s room during \u201cBeyond The Wall.\u201d She then, because she\u2019s such a great snoop, found Arya\u2019s bag of faces under the bed. Arya Stark is not so careless as to leave a valuable weapon and a bag of faces sitting around\u2026\n\n\u2026unless the show needs to lay the groundwork for a big reveal in the season finale.\n\n3. Arya ends their chilly conversation by putting the dagger in Sansa\u2019s hands, and that\u2019s where I think her intentions are revealed. She\u2019s not trying to frame Sansa for Petyr\u2019s death to get her in trouble; she\u2019s doing it to bolster her position with the lords of the north.\n\n4. When Petyr arranged for Arya to find Sansa\u2019s note from King\u2019s Landing he meant for it to drive a wedge between the two sisters, and that\u2019s exactly what the show is making Arya pretend it did. My prediction is she saw through it immediately, recognized the way it could damage Sansa and determined then that the only way out was to take his life now and set up Sansa as the one who saved the north from his treachery.\n\nThe biggest missing piece here is for the show to create a reason why the lords of the north would hate Petyr. I\u2019m sure they don\u2019t like him, but I\u2019m also not sure they want him dead. I think Game of Thrones will use the 79-minute season seven finale titled \u201cThe Dragon and the Wolf\u201d to reveal Petyr as the man behind the attempt on Bran\u2019s life, who turned on Ned Stark an murdered Lysa Tully.\n\nWhat better way to reinforce Sansa\u2019s position than to frame her as the hero who killed the traitorous Littlefinger?\n\nThey wouldn\u2019t show us the scene with Arya as Walder at the beginning of the season and then forget the entire thing. They wouldn\u2019t reveal Arya\u2019s secret to Sansa in the penultimate episode if they didn\u2019t intend it to be a BIG part of the finale. They wouldn\u2019t include Petyr\u2019s dagger in the scene without reason.\n\nI think it will be the bookend to Arya\u2019s story in season seven. It starts with pretending to be Walder Frey to avenge her mother and brother, it ends with pretending to be Petyr Baelish after she brings him winter.\n\n[UPDATE] I had another thought here: What if Arya really is mad at her sister and will use Petyr\u2019s face to humiliate Sansa and gain dominance in their relationship? If the jealousy and anger Arya has shown toward Sansa is real, what better way to turn it against her than use Littlefinger\u2019s mask to convince Sansa to act against her then reveal her own face?\n\nA ridiculous Arya-Sansa theory\nThis one is stupid, but I\u2019m compelled to reveal it just in case. Arya has shown unusual envy toward Sansa since they reunited. \u201cYour pretty handwriting.\u201d \u201cI remember the pretty dress you were wearing. I remember the fancy way you did your hair.\u201d \u201cYou wanted to be a queen, to sit next to a handsome young king on the iron throne.\u201d \u201cI wonder what it would feel like to wear those pretty dresses. To be the Lady of Winterfell.\u201d\n\nMy ridiculous Arya-Sansa theory is that Arya will become so consumed with jealousy and rage toward her sister that she kills the Lady of Winterfell and takes her face. It would be a fitting tragedy for the only family on the show that shows true familial love.\n\nYou\u2019re on thin ice\nWhy is there thin ice north of the wall? If the land is so cold its inhabitants have to keep moving and having sex to stay warm then the ice should be thick enough to walk on.\n\nHow am I supposed to be afraid of winter if it\u2019s not even going to get cold enough to freeze a lake?\n\nWTF, Hound?\nWhat\u2019s wrong with The Hound? He appeared to be shellshocked during the fight with the zombie polar bear and then inexplicably goaded the dead army into attacking Jon\u2019s team on their little rock. What\u2019s his deal?\n\nShe told Petyr, simply, \u201cI haven\u2019t heard from Jon in weeks.\u201d That\u2019s all it takes. In fact that whole interview really makes me angry and pushes me more toward the thinking in this Screenrant column about how this season has gone off the rails.\n\nAnd I wholeheartedly agree with the assertion in this piece from Esquire: \u201cWhile things began to crack last season\u2014its first without the guiding light of George R.R. Martin\u2019s books\u2014it has become clear that the writers don\u2019t know how to complete the author\u2019s vision.\u201d"
