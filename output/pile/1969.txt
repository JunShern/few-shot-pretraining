Contributors include Dimitris Papadopoulos, Brian Rappert, Wenda K. Bauchspies, Mar\u0131a Puig de la Bellacasa, Jennifer Croissant, and Scott Frickel.\n\nIt is nothing new for anthropologists to be curious about things that for us, as outsiders, are hidden from view. In Melanesia and West Africa, where concealed ritual practices central in customary politics, \u201csecrecy\u201d has long been an ethnographic preoccupation. With elaborate systems of esoteric knowledge, these regions have proved particularly fertile ground for western scholars with a poetic preference for the other-worldly. However anthropologists have rarely paid attention to an indispensable condition of secret knowledge: the experience of ignorance.\n\nWhen faced with culturally produced forms of not-knowing, the assumption has often been that we should set out to pierce that ignorance. According to this logic, it is only \u201cby peering behind the facade that we see things as an insider rather than as outsiders and thereby discover the truth\u201d (Gable 1997: 215). But does uncovering \u2018hidden truth\u2019 risk distorting the way in which our interlocutors experience (not)knowing in their daily lives?\n\nThis panel features contributions which explore the question of ignorance from exactly the opposite direction; beginning with the recognition that ethnographers are often far from being the only people on the \u201cwrong\u201d side of this knowledge facade. The discussion will contribute to a small but growing body of work (reviews in Mair, Kelly & High 2012; McGoey 2012) that aims to take ignorance seriously \u2013 not simply as the absence of knowledge, but as an ethnographic object in its own right.\n\nWith the support of the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics at Harvard University, Christopher Robertson (James E. Rogers College of Law at the University of Arizona) and Aaron Kesselheim (Harvard Medical School) are organizing a multidisciplinary symposium to examine potential solutions to institutional corruption that use the strategy of concealing biasing information from decision makers.\n\nThis event is part of the Institutional Corruption Lab. Larry Lessig (Safra Center Director and Roy L. Furman Professor of Law and Leadership at Harvard Law School) has defined \u2018institutional corruption\u2019 as the consequence of an influence within an economy of influence that illegitimately weakens the effectiveness of an institution especially by weakening the public trust of the institution. The concept provides a more systematic approach to decision-making problems that can arise as a result of financial relationships and other conflicts of interest.\n\nInstitutional corruption may arise in many contexts, from medical research to forensic science, from political campaign finance to financial auditing. There are many potential solutions to institutional corruption, but we are particularly interested in practical mechanisms that acknowledge the existence of potential influences, but prevent that biasing information from reaching a decision maker. Such mechanisms may include blinding, masking, placebos, strategic ignorance, information aversion, veil of ignorance rules, blind trusts, walls of separation, or similar concepts. We are interested in reviews of relevant literature, and new laboratory, empirical, historical, and theoretical research that explores the functions, modalities, costs, benefits, and limitations of concealing a source of information to improve decision making. We are interested in established uses of blinding, and potential new applications.\n\n\u201cAgnotology,\u201d the study of the production and preservation of ignorance, is a field identified by Robert Proctor twenty years ago. The pioneers of agnotology were keen to uncover and denounce the intentional manufacture and purposeful perpetuation of ignorance. The original focus of the field concerned the maneuvers of corporate or political bodies aimed at nourishing doubt concerning scientific findings so as to block political action and to facilitate profitable yet deleterious consumption (tobacco, sugar..) or industrial practices (asbestos, dioxin\u2026). Trade or military secrets constitute yet another mechanism of willful ignorance.\n\nAgnotology is the downside of epistemology: it studies the conceptual basis and social-historical genesis of ignorance, just as epistemology does with respect to knowledge. However, the symmetry is not perfect, for manufacturers of ignorance are seldom led to generate knowledge, while producers of knowledge are surrounded by pools of ignorance, both left out of their reach or generated in the very process of knowledge acquisition. Indeed, perpetrators of willful ignorance piggy-back on the \u2018natural\u2019 production by science of ignorance.\n\nAn international conference organized by Martin Carrier at ZiF Bielefeld in June 2011 was mainly devoted to the original theme and motivation of agnotology. The present proposal is to widen the perspective to the geneses of ignorance, with or without malign intent, and to enlist the resources of philosophy in order to clarify the status and dynamics of ignorance, in the social context of an increasing emphasis on the production and dissemination of knowledge. Some of the well-identified issues in epistemology are: transcendental relations (in the Kantian sense), cognitive limitations, semantic incommensurability. Social epistemology suggests further relevant issues, such as the social functions of, and the right to ignorance, or again \u201cignorance in the field\u201d, i.e. the impoverished epistemic state that is inherent to the situation of the engaged, hands-on end-user (school teacher, physician, farmer, politician, industrialist\u2026): what is the appropriate handling of that sort of ignorance? Can science, and society, alleviate the problem, and how?\n\n''Ignorance by Design: Rethinking Knowledge, Anti-knowledge and the Unknown in STS' -\nCo-Organized by Matthias Gross and Linsey McGoey, panel at the 4S/EASST Joint Meeting Design and Displacement, Copenhagen, October 17-20, 2012.\n\n'Beyond Risk: Governing Unknowns' -\nOrganized by Matthias Gross, under the guise of the International Sociological Association (ISA) Research Committee on Sociology of Science and Technology (RC23), at the Second ISA Forum of Sociology, Buenos Aires, Argentina, August 1-4, 2012."
