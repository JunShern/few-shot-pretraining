Also, we don't have the email of all such users hence can't easily communicate with them.\nIs it acceptable practice to ask a question on superuser.com (with error screenshot) and answer it ourselves (tell user to upgrade)?\nThe idea is that superuser.com is well indexed and page ranked hence would show up high in results of users looking up the error message.\n\nA:\n\nI'd suggest a few things.\nFirstly, remember the question and answer format and don't make it like an ad. So, ask a question as a confused, lost user would, and answer it likewise\nSecondly, make it clear you work for the company - I notice you have it in your profile, but including it in your answer as well.\nThird is a general thing. Answers that link to a specific version are slightly lame. Link to a general update page rather than a direct link, so it would be usable should the version go off.\nIts unusual, but ought to be fine, as long as you do it right.\nI do notice some other non product activity and you've asked nicely, so as far as I go, I'm sure you aren't a spammer for doing this. \n\n"
