    "text": "In a declining PC market, Creative\nAssembly has taken a\ngreat risk in keeping true to its series with Shogun 2 : Total War.\nstyle=\"\"> Unlike other sequels\nrecently, Shogun 2 is\njust as complex as its predecessors in the grand scheme of things while\nonly\ncutting back on the interface and trimming the fat of unused features\nof the\nlast few games in the series.Rest\nassured that the Total War series has not been \u0091consoleified\u0092!\n\nstyle=\"font-style: italic;\">Even samurai have weaknesses,like flaming\nbombardment. Then again most things are weak to flaming\nbombardment...\n\nFor those of you that don\u0092t know what\nTotal War is all\nabout, it\u0092s about pure conquest.You\nhave two main views of gameplay.The\nfirst is a strategic province map where you can select your next\ntargets, move\narmies around, and fortify territory and relations with other\ncountries,\nresembling something along the lines of Risk or Civilization.\nstyle=\"\"> But where the gameplay\nreally starts to shine\nis the tactical combat that happens when armies clash, where the\ngameplay zooms\ndown to a more traditional RTS level, albeit with a few thousand troops\non the\nfield!\n\nThe resulting clash is a matter of\ntactics and\nrock-paper-scissors, as each troop type has a natural advantage over\nothers.There are\noften neutral\nbuildings on the battlefield though, and controlling those will give\npassive\nbenefits to your army and prevent stalemate style tactics on open\nground.When the\nbattle is won, the province is\ncaptured and you\u0092re one step closer to your ultimate goal\u0097becoming the\nShogun!\n\nCautions\n\nShogun 2 has received a T for Teen. It's a semi-realistic depiction of warfare, and blood will spill. Assassinations, geisha 'diplomacy', and some swearing are involved. Keep this in mind if any of the younger ones are playing.\n\nGameplay - 95 / 100\n\nOne doesn\u0092t conquer Japan in a day though. Over a multitude of turns, you\u0092ll have to deal with the other lords. Some prefer offensive actions and a show of strength to keep you at bay, but diplomacy is often better than open war. You simply cannot fund a war with opponents on all sides, so keeping people content with offerings and pacts until you\u0092re ready to destroy them is a preferred (and historically accurate!) way of dealing with things.\n\nAssassinations return, and over the course of both tactical and strategic gameplay you\u0092ll get treated to mini-cutscenes of events unfolding. Oddly enough, the cutscene for a failed ninja maneuver is better than a successful one! Warlords issue inspiring speeches at the beginning of combat, and that greatly increases the epic feeling of a war game.\n\nDoes the formula still work though? Absolutely! The unit balance is a little confusing at first (Do you know the difference between a Yari and a Naginata?) but once you get the feel for things, you\u0092ll be issuing decisive orders and uniting Japan under the banner of your choosing. It\u0092s a little bit of a step back from the previous Empire and Medieval II from a unit depth standpoint, but that\u0092s actually for the better. Those games were filled with useless units and dominant strategies and neither of those problems have reared their head thus far with Shogun II.\n\nGraphics - 90 / 100\n\nstyle=\"font-style: italic;\">The attention to detail is\noutstanding, and it even looks this good in motion. That is,\nif you have a graphics card from the last 6 months.\n\nThere is one word for the graphics of\nShogun II :\nstunning.Another\nphrase could be used\ntoo though and that\u0092s \u0091incredibly taxing\u0092.While on the highest settings it\u0092ll rock your world as men\nbrandishing\nsteel charge each other in bloody combat, it\u0092ll also make your video\ncard\nlikely melt from the processing necessary.Even the map of Japan looks impressive as you zoom through\nit, with fog,\ncrashing waves, and more to make each territory feel much more alive.\n\nIs this a game worth upgrading for\nthough?Perhaps\nnot, but is there another strategy or\ntactics game in the near future that will push you that far?\nstyle=\"\"> You might as well upgrade\nfor this and the\nnewest expansion to Dawn of War II because you\u0092ll be hard pressed to\nget more\nimpressive animations and scale than these games.\n\nSound - 87 / 100\n\nWarcries, rousing speeches, and the visceral sound of combat never get old. Shogun II delivers a solid musical score to complement the outstanding voice work and effects, and while it could use some more variety, it fits the setting well.\n\nMultiplayer - 90 / 100\n\nstyle=\"font-style: italic;\">The map of Japan has as much\ngraphical detail as recent RTS games do in their gameplay.\nIt's quite impressive.\n\nNo one expected deep multiplayer, but\nShogun II actually\ndelivers a solid experience.As\nyou\nattack and win matches against provinces, you unlock more units to mess\naround\nwith.Typical\nbattles are fought as\nsingle engagements, with each side having a funding allotment to buy X\nunits.Battles are\nthen won with tactics\nand strategic engagement, and capturing of the neutral buildings to\ngain a\npositional advantage.It\u0092s\nentirely\npossible to defeat a superior force if your units have a better\nposition at\nhigher ground, so no battle will play out twice as cavalry storm the\nfield in\none plains war, where as another one will charge forward with samurai\narmed\nwith bow and katana! Both custom games and matchmaking are\navailable, and you\u0092ll\nnever have to look far for an opponent!\n\nValue - 82 / 100\n\nThe bugs get in the way of the fun out of the box though. Creative Assembly has been prompt with fixes, but it\u0092s disappointing as ever to find a game ridden with camera and multiplayer bugs. Since the majority of the game-breaking bugs are toast, you\u0092re free to enjoy a game that will play out differently every time you play it, especially since you can change who you play as and customize each game appropriately. If you\u0092re sick of the strategy, you can get into a quick and dirty tactical war with another player within a minute, giving the game a surprisingly strong value for both single and multiplayer, something I certainly wasn\u0092t expecting from the Total War series at this point.\n\nLasting Appeal - 82 / 100\n\nWith a few more limitations on unit variety compared to previous games in the series, the lasting appeal of this game has taken a small hit. However, the speed and feel of the combat has improved for the better, and ensure that this is the go-to Total War game, especially for multiplayer. Of course, if you\u0092re not into the setting, you\u0092re not going to get a lot out of this game, but you know damn well what to expect with Shogun II. Knowing that, you\u0092re going to be playing this game for a long, long time.\n\nPros and Cons\n\nPros:\n\nInterface has been\nstreamlined, but still remains\npowerful as it should be for a PC strategy game.\n\nWatching\nhuge samurai battles never gets old.\n\nMultiplayer is quick and\npainless, and no two players\nwield the same armies.\n\nCons\n\nRequires\nan absolute beast of a machine to run at max settings with large armies.\n\nSomewhat\nsimpler than previous games, which hurts for longtime fans of the\nseries.\n\nSome stupid bugs and\nglitches in the initial launch,\nand a few still exist.\n\nConclusion\n\nSo does Shogun 2 live up to the Total War franchise name? Absolutely! Returning to the warring states of Japan and simplifying the formulas slightly was a great move for the series, and with a fresh coat of glossy paint for graphics, it\u0092ll give a new generation of gamers a taste of how massive battles were born with Total War. It might take every last bit of power for your computer to make it shine, but samurai combat and ninja assassinations never looked better. You don\u0092t need a geisha\u0092s help to convince you that this sequel is worthy."
