    "text": "The present invention relates to a surgical instrument such as a dental scalpel and more specifically to an improved blade and chuck assembly for scalpels and similar knife-like instruments.\nIn my U.S. Patent Application No. 07/062113, filed June 13, 1987, U.S. Pat. No. 4,788,976, there is disclosed a dental scalpel having a universally adjustable blade in which the blade itself is removably connected and disconnected in a chuck. The necessity of providing a quick and easily detachable chuck and blade connection will be quite evident. On the other hand, the provision of a connection which secures against the introduction and accumulation of blood, virus and bacteria in through the instrument itself (i.e. chuck, handle or the like), while also evident, has only recently become essential due to the discovery of bacteria and viruses which resist normal sterilization procedures.\nVarious patents have been published relating to chuck and blade assemblies. For example, Ward U.S. Pat. No. 3,479,041 provides a blade interacting with a chuck assembly. Gleason U.S. Pat. No. 3,934,591 discloses a surgical knife interacting with a chuck assembly. Weinger U.S. Pat. No. 3,108,376 discloses a surgical blade having a rectangular mount removably engaging a correspondingly square-shaped opening member secured to a handle. Various dental accessory and blade attachments and/or assemblies are also disclosed in the following U.S. Pats. Nos: 4,525,144; 907,003; 1,316,685; 2,465,433; and 3,430,345.\nNotwithstanding the variety of the known devices, none provides for quick and easy connection and disconnection while at the same time insuring against the egregious introduction of harmful bacteria and virus through the instrument itself. A further disadvantage found in the prior art devices is that each lacks full and complete structural support for the blade during its use and manipulation by the surgeon.\nIt is, therefore, a broad object of the present invention to provide a chuck and blade assembly for scalpels and the like which overcome the disadvantages of the prior art devices.\nIt is another object of the present invention to provide a secure fit for the blade which prevents lateral movement and/or spinning of the blade in the chuck.\nA further object of the present invention is to provide barrier means which prevent the intrusion and/or accumulation of bacteria, virus and body fluids within the chuck or handle itself.\nIt is yet another object of the present invention to provide for maximum rigidity of the blade during use and to provide the shortest extending longitudinal distance of the blade from the chuck itself.\nThe foregoing objects as well as advantages, together with numerous other objects and advantages, are set forth in the following disclosure."
