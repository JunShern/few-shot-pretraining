    "text": "Kamasi Washington released one of our favorite records of 2017 with his Harmony of Difference EP, and now the prolific jazz saxophonist has announced a brand new LP. Titled Heaven and Earth, the double album follows Washington\u2019s 2015 three-disc album The Epic. The record is out June 22nd via Young Turks.\n\nWashington said this of the new record on Twitter: \u201cThe Earth side represents the world as I see it outwardly, the world that I am a part of. The Heaven side represents the world as I see it inwardly, the world that is a part of me.\u201d Joining him in this journey are contributors Thundercat, Terrace Martin, Ronald Bruner, Jr., Cameron Graves, Brandon Coleman, Miles Mosley, Patrice Quinn, Tony Austin.\n\n\n\nUpdate: Washington has shared the first two tracks from the album, \u201cFists of Fury\u201d and \u201cThe Space Travelers Lullaby\u201d, along with dates for an extensive world tour. Get all the info here.\n\nLast year, Washington collaborated with the likes of St. Vincent, Ibeyi, and Thundercat, and joined Terrace Martin\u2019s all-star collective The Pollyseeds. He\u2019ll appear alongside Kendrick Lamar, Flying Lotus, and more on Herbie Hancock\u2019s forthcoming album.\n\nSo happy to announce my new project, a double album called \"Heaven and Earth!\" The Earth side represents the world as I see it outwardly, the world that I am a part of. The Heaven side represents the world as I see it inwardly, the world that is a part of me. ????: B+ & Mike Park pic.twitter.com/52FvNKAIhA \u2014 Kamasi Washington (@KamasiW) April 9, 2018\n\nHeaven and Earth Tracklist:\n\nEarth\n\n01.
