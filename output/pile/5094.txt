    "text": "Recent headlines are screaming about the Trump administration\u2019s alleged attempt to \u201ckill $3 billion in foreign aid,\u201d preventing a tidal wave of year-end spending by the State Department. The administration has yet to confirm this is their plan. But if it were, would it really be the end of the world?\n\nPresident Trump Donald John TrumpSteele Dossier sub-source was subject of FBI counterintelligence probe Pelosi slams Trump executive order on pre-existing conditions: It 'isn't worth the paper it's signed on' Trump 'no longer angry' at Romney because of Supreme Court stance MORE ran on a platform of decreasing and reordering our spending priorities, focusing on what is good for making America great. Changing the status quo spending at the State Department, which has remained largely the same since he took office, should not come as a shock to the swamp.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nUnder current law, these cuts are legal. Using a process called\n\nrescissions\n\n, the White House can propose funding cuts to Congress. Congress can then vote on legislation to implement the cuts.\n\nBut here\u2019s the trick. Normally, the president\u2019s rescissions expire if Congress doesn\u2019t act within 45 days. But, with less than 45 days left in fiscal year 2018, Congress would need to affirmatively act to prevent these cuts from taking place, instead of just letting them expire.\n\nSen. Bob Corker Robert (Bob) Phillips CorkerHas Congress captured Russia policy? Tennessee primary battle turns nasty for Republicans Cheney clashes with Trump MORE (R-Tenn.), chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has vowed to challenge the administration if they take such a step. He wouldn\u2019t be the first Republican senator to do so. Recall Trump\u2019s failed $15 billion rescissions package from earlier this year, where the president\u2019s attempt at forcing some fiscal austerity was thwarted at the last minute by fellow Republican, Sen. Richard Burr Richard Mauze BurrHillicon Valley: Subpoenas for Facebook, Google and Twitter on the cards | Wray rebuffs mail-in voting conspiracies | Reps. raise mass surveillance concerns Bipartisan representatives demand answers on expired surveillance programs Rep. Mark Walker says he's been contacted about Liberty University vacancy MORE (R-N.C).\n\nCorker\u2019s outrage aside (he is retiring in December, after all), State Department spending is in dire need of review. The agency itself wasn\u2019t reauthorized for over a decade, and then at the last-minute a bill was signed by President Obama in December 2016 without any amendments and very little debate.\n\nBut this is a new administration, with different priorities. At a minimum, good governance mandates a review of the millions allocated to hardly-heard-of and hardly-overseen multinational organizations.\n\nFor example, should the US really be spending $33 million on unspecified programs of the Food & Agriculture Organization (FAO) under the \u201cinternational disaster assistance\u201d account with the intentionally vague purpose description \u201csupport to FAO activities worldwide\u201d? It is baffling that swaths of cash should be given so loosely to international organizations while Congress frequently has to pass \u201cemergency\u201d spending packages to pay for disaster assistance at home.\n\nOr how about the $21 million from the \u201ceconomic support fund\u201d account going to the International Organization for Migration slated to \u201cSupport the inclusion for Peace Activity that aims to foster social and economic inclusion of Afro-Colombian and Indigenous communities that have been disproportionately affected by conflict\u201d?\n\nNot that these are independently bad programs, but in both cases, this funding is not clearly specified, not well-monitored, and has an unclear benefit to the American people. At the very least, those running these programs should be required to consistently make the case for the dollars they spend.\n\nThis problem exists among many lesser-known agencies and programs financed by American taxpayers. Take for example, the Office of Transition Initiatives run out of USAID that is supposed to finance development in countries transitioning from authoritarianism to democracy but instead has been found to be financing television programs promoting \u201calternative family structures\u201d on Macedonian television.\n\nIt is not abnormal for large buckets of money to remain unspent at the end of the fiscal year. Former Sen. Tom Coburn Thomas (Tom) Allen CoburnCOVID response shows a way forward on private gun sale checks Inspector general independence must be a bipartisan priority in 2020 Congress must protect federal watchdogs MORE (R-Okla.), infamous for his \u201cwastebook,\u201d reminded everyone of the perpetuity of some pots of congressionally authorized funds. But if the money is not yet obligated less than 40 days away from the end of the fiscal year, we should really be asking if the money is actually necessary. In the case of many of our international assistance programs funded through Department of State and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the answer is no.\n\nPrograms that aren\u2019t given proper guidance and oversight from Congress are instead left to the devices of the bureaucrats at the State Department. Given this, it\u2019s no wonder that the State Department and other various agencies have financed a pro-left agenda around the world, promoting cultural values that undermine nation-states\u2019 sovereignty rather than providing traditional foreign assistance.\n\nMany more examples abound, but the priorities of the former administration are not those of this one. For conservatives, it is positive to hear of proposed changes hopefully forthcoming to more than $3 billion of the nearly $40 billion foreign assistance budget.\n\nRepublicans should not be afraid of rescissions. If Congress is unwilling to do its job of controlling the purse, the White House absolutely can and should propose cuts that align with its priorities. This administration has every right to redirect spending away from the previous administration\u2019s priorities. After all, it\u2019s what the American people voted for."
