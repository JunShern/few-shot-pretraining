Petrillo, of Salem, by brief and orally, for the plaintiffs.\n\n\n      Hinshaw & Culbertson LLP, of Boston, Massachusetts (Marissa I. Delinks\nand Justin M. Fabella on the brief, and Ms. Delinks orally), for the defendant.\n\n      CONBOY, J. The plaintiffs, George Maroun, Sr. (husband) and Edith\nMaroun (wife), filed a petition seeking to enjoin the defendant, Deutsche Bank\nNational Trust Company (bank), from foreclosing on property owned by the\nwife. The Superior Court (McHugh, J.) denied the plaintiffs\u2019 summary\njudgment motion and granted the bank\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment.\nThe plaintiffs appeal, and we affirm.\n\nI.    Background\n\n     The following facts are drawn from the trial court\u2019s order or are otherwise\nundisputed on the record before us. Prior to 1991, the plaintiffs owned\n\fproperty in Salem (the property) together. In 1991, the husband executed a\ndeed (1991 deed) that conveyed his interest in the property to the wife. Ten\nyears later, in 2001, the husband executed a notarized affidavit (2001 affidavit),\nwhich stated that at the time he executed the 1991 deed he was married to the\nwife and that, \u201cthrough accident, inadvertence or mistake, the deed did not\nstate that [he] released [his] homestead rights.\u201d The husband purportedly\nmade the 2001 affidavit \u201cto correct said omission.\u201d The affidavit referenced\nonly the 1991 deed, and the correction did not purport to relate to any specific\nmortgage on the property. The affidavit was filed with the Rockingham County\nRegistry of Deeds. Also in 2001, the husband and wife executed a mortgage on\nthe property (2001 mortgage), which stated: \u201cI, George C. Maroun, husband of\nmortgagor, hereby waive all rights of homestead and other interests herein.\u201d In\n2002, the husband and wife executed another mortgage on the property (2002\nmortgage) that included the same language waiving the husband\u2019s homestead\nright and other interests in the property.\n\n      In 2006, the wife, alone, executed both a promissory note and a mortgage\non the property (2006 mortgage), which are the subject of this litigation. The\nmortgage document erroneously states that the wife is a single woman.\nAlthough the mortgage document also states, \u201cBorrower [wife], and Borrower\u2019s\nspouse, if any, release all rights of homestead . . . and . . . other interests in the\nProperty,\u201d the husband did not sign the note or the mortgage document. In\n2009, the mortgage was assigned to the bank. The bank took no action to\naddress the status of the husband\u2019s homestead right.\n\n       In 2008, the wife filed an individual Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition that\nlisted the property as an asset on the required schedule of real property. In\n2010, the wife filed amended schedules of assets with the bankruptcy court in\nher bankruptcy case that asserted that the husband possessed a homestead\nright in the property and that the husband\u2019s claim had a higher priority than\nthe 2006 mortgage. When the wife ultimately emerged from bankruptcy\nprotection, she was required to pay some prepetition arrearage amounts\nsecured by the 2006 mortgage and to make certain ongoing payments on the\ndebt. Following her discharge, the wife did not cure her arrears, and the bank\nsought to foreclose upon the property.\n\n       The plaintiffs filed a petition for injunctive relief in the superior court,\narguing that the husband\u2019s homestead right has priority over the 2006\nmortgage debt, and requesting a permanent injunction against the bank\u2019s\nforeclosure sale of the property. The parties agreed that there were no disputed\nissues of material fact, and each moved for summary judgment. The trial court\ngranted the bank\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied the plaintiffs\u2019\nmotion.\n\n      On appeal, the plaintiffs argue that the trial court erroneously concluded\nthat the husband waived or released his homestead rights with respect to the\n\n\n                                          2\n\f2006 mortgage. The plaintiffs also contend that the trial court erred by not\nfinding that, pursuant to the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel,\nthe bank is estopped from foreclosing on the husband\u2019s homestead rights\nbased upon rulings in the wife\u2019s bankruptcy case. Finally, despite the trial\ncourt\u2019s finding that an erroneous reference to the wife\u2019s status as a single\nwoman in the 2006 mortgage document was probably a scrivener\u2019s error, the\nplaintiffs assert that the erroneous reference \u201cis not without relevance.\u201d We\naddress each argument in turn.\n\nII.    Standard of Review\n\n       In reviewing the trial court\u2019s rulings on cross-motions for summary\njudgment, \u201cwe consider the evidence in the light most favorable to each party in\nits capacity as the nonmoving party and, if no genuine issue of material fact\nexists, we determine whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a\nmatter of law.\u201d Granite State Mgmt. & Res. v. City of Concord, 165 N.H. 277,\n282 (2013) (quotation omitted). \u201cIf our review of that evidence discloses no\ngenuine issue of material fact and if the moving party is entitled to judgment as\na matter of law, then we will affirm the grant of summary judgment.\u201d Id.\n(quotation omitted).\n\nIII.   Waiver of Homestead Right\n\n      The trial court concluded that the husband\u2019s notarized 2001 \u201caffidavit\nexplaining that his intent in giving the deed was to release his homestead\nrights\u201d was \u201csufficient to validly waive his homestead rights\u201d as to the 2006\nmortgage. On appeal, the plaintiffs argue that the trial court erroneously\n\u201cimputed\u201d the husband\u2019s prior waivers of his homestead right, including the\nwaiver in the 2001 affidavit, to the 2006 mortgage because the homestead\nstatute \u201cdoes not contain conditional words or phrases regarding when or how\nfrequently a written waiver or encumbrance of [the] homestead must occur to\nbe valid.\u201d\n\n      Resolving this issue requires us to interpret and apply the statutory\nhomestead exemption. See RSA 480:1, :3-a, :5-a (2013), :4 (Supp. 2014). The\ninterpretation and application of statutes present questions of law, which we\nreview de novo. Deyeso v. Cavadi, 165 N.H. 76, 79 (2013). In matters of\nstatutory interpretation, we are the final arbiters of the legislature\u2019s intent as\nexpressed in the words of the statute considered as a whole. Chase v.\nAmeriquest Mortgage Co., 155 N.H. 19, 22 (2007). When examining the\nlanguage of a statute, we ascribe the plain and ordinary meaning to the words\nused. Id. We do not construe statutes in isolation; instead, we attempt to do\nso in harmony with the overall statutory scheme. Id. When interpreting two or\nmore statutes that deal with a similar subject matter, we construe them so that\nthey do not contradict each other, and so that they will lead to reasonable\nresults and effectuate the legislative purpose of the statutes. Id. Statutory\n\n\n                                        3\n\fhomestead protections are universally held to be liberally construed to achieve\ntheir public policy objective. See Deyeso, 165 N.H. at 80.\n\n        In New Hampshire, \u201c[e]very person is entitled to $100,000 worth of his or\nher homestead, or of his or her interest therein, as a homestead.\u201d RSA 480:1.\n\u201cThe homestead right is generally exempt from attachment or encumbrance.\u201d\nStewart v. Bader, 154 N.H. 75, 88 (2006). \u201cThe purpose of the homestead\nexemption is to secure to debtors and their families the shelter of the\nhomestead roof.\u201d Deyeso, 165 N.H. at 79; see also Gunnison v. Twitchel, 38\nN.H. 62, 69 (1859) (\u201c[T]he great and paramount object of the homestead act [is]\n. . . to protect and preserve inviolate . . . a family home . . . .\u201d). \u201cThe exemption\nprotects the family from destitution, and protects society from the danger of its\ncitizens becoming paupers.\u201d Deyeso, 165 N.H. at 79-80 (quotation, brackets,\nand ellipsis omitted). \u201cIt also promotes the stability and welfare of the state by\nencouraging property ownership and independence on the part of the citizen.\u201d\nId. at 80 (quotation and brackets omitted).\n\n       The statutory protection of the homestead right also extends to spouses\nwho occupy the homestead but are not title owners of the property: \u201cThe owner\nand the husband or wife of the owner are entitled to occupy the homestead\nright during the owner\u2019s lifetime,\u201d and, after the owner\u2019s death, the surviving\nspouse is entitled to the homestead right during his or her lifetime. RSA\n480:3-a; see Bothell v. Sweet, 6 A. 646, 648 (N.H. 1886) (concluding that\nplaintiff\u2019s homestead right was not affected by three mortgages in which she\ndid not join because she \u201cpreserved her homestead right by occupation\u201d). The\nstatute, therefore, contemplates a homestead right in both spouses, even when\nonly one spouse legally owns the homestead. See RSA 480:3-a.\n\n       In accord with the statute\u2019s purpose, RSA 480:4 states that \u201c[t]he\nhomestead right is exempt from attachment during its continuance from levy or\nsale on execution, and from liability to be encumbered or taken for the\npayment of debts.\u201d The statute provides only four exceptions to the homestead\nright exemption: (1) \u201cthe collection of taxes\u201d; (2) \u201cthe enforcement of liens of\nmechanics and others for debts created in the construction, repair or\nimprovement of the homestead\u201d; (3) \u201cthe enforcement of mortgages which are\nmade a charge thereon according to law\u201d; and (4) \u201cthe levy of executions as\nprovided in this chapter.\u201d RSA 480:4; see Deyeso, 165 N.H. at 79.\nAdditionally, \u201c[n]o deed shall convey or encumber the homestead right, except a\nmortgage made at the time of purchase to secure payment of the purchase\nmoney, unless it is executed by the owner and wife or husband, if any, with the\nformalities required for the conveyance of land.\u201d RSA 480:5-a. Moreover, if a\ndeed is signed by both spouses with the requisite formalities, there is no\nrequirement that the text of the deed contain an express waiver of the\nhomestead right. See Verdolino v. Anderson, 12 F. Supp. 2d 205, 206 (D.N.H.\n1998) (rejecting argument that a mortgage document must contain an explicit\nwaiver of the homestead exemption); Perley v. Woodbury, 76 N.H. 23, 25-26\n\n\n                                          4\n\f(1911) (recognizing that if the statutory requirements are satisfied, an express\nwaiver is unnecessary to encumber or convey the homestead right).\n\n       Here, there is no dispute that the husband did not sign the 2006\nmortgage. Therefore, the 2006 mortgage did not comply with RSA 480:5-a and\ndid not convey or encumber any homestead right that the husband had in the\nproperty. See RSA 480:5-a. The bank does not challenge this proposition but\nargues, instead, that the husband did not have a homestead right to assert in\n2006 because he had waived all his interest in the property, including his\nhomestead right, by virtue of the waiver contained in his 2001 affidavit. We\nagree.\n\n       The 2001 affidavit waiver is distinguishable from the 2001 and 2002\nmortgage waivers executed in compliance with RSA 480:5-a. The two mortgage\nwaivers cannot be interpreted to act upon any other conveyance or\nencumbrance. Cf. Chase, 155 N.H. at 22-23 (concluding mortgage could not\nconstitute a charge on homestead according to law because it did not satisfy\nstatutory requirements of RSA 477:3 and RSA 480:5-a). In contrast, by\nexecuting the 2001 affidavit, the husband purported to relinquish his\nhomestead right, not with respect to a specific encumbrance, but with respect\nto the conveyance of his entire interest in the property to his wife. Thus, the\nissue before us is whether that waiver was effective as to the 2006 mortgage,\nnotwithstanding the fact that the husband did not sign the mortgage document\nand continued to reside in the property with his wife. See RSA 480:3-a, :4.\n\n       Waiver is the voluntary or intentional abandonment or relinquishment of\na known right. See Debonis v. Warden, N.H. State Prison, 153 N.H. 603, 605\n(2006). \u201c[T]he general principle, recognized by repeated decisions and by\ncommon sense, is, that a provision, made by law for the benefit of particular\nindividuals, may be waived by them.\u201d Fletcher v. Neally, 20 N.H. 464, 466\n(1846); see, e.g., Debonis, 153 N.H. at 605 (noting that petitioner waived his\nstatutory right to a revocation hearing); Duke/Fluor Daniel v. Hawkeye\nFunding, 150 N.H. 581, 584 (2004) (recognizing that statutory mechanic\u2019s lien\ncan be waived by contract). Statutory exemptions, such as the homestead\nright, are generally considered personal privileges of the debtor. See Pappas v.\nCapps, 263 P. 411, 411 (Colo. 1928) (considering automobile exemption);\nWyman v. Gay, 37 A. 325, 326 (Me. 1897) (addressing exemption of certain\nchattels); Currier v. Sutherland, 54 N.H. 475, 486 (1874) (recognizing that\n\u201c[t]he exemption of a homestead from attachment or levy is a personal privilege\nwhich the law gives to the owner\u201d). Other jurisdictions have concluded that\n\u201c[o]ne has a right to waive an exemption in his own favor unless he also holds it\nfor the benefit of others or unless such waiver is against public policy or some\nconstitutional or statutory restriction.\u201d In re Kline\u2019s Estate, 24 N.W.2d 481,\n483 (Iowa 1946) (concluding widow waived deceased husband\u2019s exemption for\nautomobile by selling vehicle and converting asset into nonexempt property);\nsee also 31 Am. Jur. 2d Exemptions \u00a7 277 (2012) (noting that, \u201capart from an\n\n\n                                        5\n\fattempt to do so by executory agreement,\u201d a debtor \u201chas the option to claim or\nwaive or may be estopped to assert\u201d an exemption unless \u201cit would be contrary\nto public policy\u201d).\n\n       Although, generally, statutory rights may be waived, the legislature has\nthe power to limit, or even prohibit such waivers. See, e.g., RSA 275:50 (2010)\n(prohibiting waiver of statutory right to payment of wages, except as provided\nelsewhere in the statute); RSA 540:28 (2007) (declaring any waiver by tenant of\nrights under RSA chapter 540 to \u201cbe null and void\u201d). Nothing in RSA chapter\n480, however, expressly prohibits a waiver of the homestead right. Further,\nlimited waivers of the homestead right are specifically provided for under other\nstatutory provisions. See RSA 477:44, IV (2013) (contemplating waiver of\nhomestead right with respect to a security interest in manufactured housing);\nRSA 480:5-a (providing approach for conveying or encumbering the homestead\nright); RSA 560:14 (2007) (allowing waiver of homestead right after the right\nvests in surviving spouse upon the owner-spouse\u2019s death); RSA 560:15, :16\n(2007) (allowing waiver of homestead right before marriage). The language of\nthe homestead right statute is also instructive. It provides that \u201c[e]very person\nis entitled to $100,000 worth of his or her homestead, or of his or her interest\ntherein, as a homestead.\u201d RSA 480:1 (emphasis added). Thus, the statute\ncasts the homestead right as a personal privilege, which the homeowner and\nspouse are entitled to exercise. See Reed v. Union Bank of Winchester, 70 Va.\n(29 Gratt.) 719, 724-27 (1878) (concluding that waiver of exemption was\npermitted under Virginia constitution).\n\n      Therefore, we hold that homestead rights, like other statutory rights, may\nbe waived by the holder of the right, unless such a waiver would be against\npublic policy or some constitutional or statutory restriction. See Marine Credit\nUnion v. Detlefson-Delano, 830 N.W.2d 859, 865 (Minn. 2013) (recognizing that\nthe Minnesota Supreme Court has \u201csaid that homestead rights may be\nwaived\u201d). However, given the protective purpose of the homestead right, we\nfurther hold that there is a presumption against such a waiver, and a party\nmay waive the homestead right broadly, as was the case here, \u201conly by an act\nwhich evidences an unequivocal intention to do so.\u201d Id. (quotation omitted). Of\ncourse, compliance with RSA 480:5-a, which allows for conveyance or\nencumbrance of the homestead right by deed, obviates the need for proof of\nsuch an unequivocal intention. See Verdolino, 12 F. Supp. 2d at 206; Perley,\n76 N.H. at 25-26. Thus, if a mortgage document is signed by both spouses,\n\u201cwith the formalities required for the conveyance of land,\u201d no further evidence\nof waiver is required. RSA 480:5-a.\n\n      Whether the husband waived his homestead right here turns on the\nlanguage of the 2001 affidavit and the circumstances surrounding its filing. In\nthe 2001 affidavit, the husband states: \u201c[T]hrough accident, inadvertence or\nmistake, the [1991] deed did not state that I released my homestead rights.\nThis affidavit is given to correct said omission.\u201d Thus, the document expressly\n\n\n                                        6\n\fconveys the husband\u2019s unequivocal intention to waive his homestead right with\nrespect to the 1991 conveyance to his wife.\n\n       Because we have concluded that a waiver is permissible under the\nhomestead right statute, and the plaintiffs have not argued that this waiver\nviolated any other statutory or constitutional provision, we next consider\nwhether this waiver violates public policy. Historically, we have been protective\nof the homestead right when an owner-spouse has attempted to relinquish the\nright without the consent of the non-owner spouse. See, e.g., Atkinson v.\nAtkinson, 37 N.H. 434, 436 (1859) (recognizing wife\u2019s homestead right over\npetitionee\u2019s claim of ownership through deed executed only by the husband,\nnotwithstanding wife\u2019s absence from the homestead, because \u201cshe was\ncompelled by ill treatment to abandon her husband\u201d). Our solicitude reflects\nthe fact that the homestead laws were primarily enacted for the protection of\nthe non-owner spouse and dependent children. See Meyer Bros. Drug Co. v.\nBybee, 78 S.W. 579, 584 (Mo. 1904). Here, the non-owner spouse expressly\nrelinquished the statutory protections under circumstances that bear no\nindicia of coercion, fraud, economic abuse, or other misconduct by the wife.\nThus, we do not conclude that the waiver, in and of itself, violates the policy\nunderlying the homestead right.\n\n      Further, although the trial court found that the 2001 affidavit was\nexecuted at the request of the mortgagee, the record is unclear as to which\nmortgagee requested the affidavit. Moreover, the plaintiffs do not allege that\nthe 2001 affidavit was coerced or that the 2001 mortgage was conditioned\nupon the husband relinquishing all future claims to a homestead exemption.\nWe, consequently, conclude that the affidavit waiver in this case did not violate\nthe policy underlying the homestead right.\n\n       Accordingly, we conclude that the husband effectively waived his\nhomestead right by executing the 2001 affidavit, and that he no longer had a\nright that he could assert against future creditors. Because the husband did\nnot have a homestead right in the property when the wife executed the 2006\nmortgage, the mortgage deed was not required to be signed by the husband in\norder to comply with RSA 480:5-a and to be a \u201ccharge thereon according to\nlaw.\u201d RSA 480:4; see Walbridge v. Estate of Beaudoin, 163 N.H. 804, 806\n(2012). We, therefore, hold that the husband\u2019s waiver of his homestead right\nwas effective as to the 2006 mortgage, and that the trial court did not err by\nconcluding \u201cthat any homestead rights possessed by [the husband are]\nsubordinate to the mortgage held by [the bank].\u201d\n\nIV.   Res Judicata and Collateral Estoppel\n\n      The plaintiffs next argue that res judicata and collateral estoppel prevent\nthe bank from foreclosing on the property due to what they assert is the\npreclusive effect of the bankruptcy court\u2019s order confirming the wife\u2019s Chapter\n\n\n                                        7\n\f13 plan. However, in their motion for summary judgment, the plaintiffs argued\nto the trial court that the bank should be \u201cjudicially estopped from asserting an\nalternate position from that taken by the [wife] in her earlier bankruptcy case.\u201d\n(Emphasis added.) But see In re Zachary G., 159 N.H. 146, 152 (2009)\n(recognizing that judicial estoppel \u201cprotects judicial integrity by preventing a\nparty from prevailing in one phase of a case using one argument and then\nrelying upon a contradictory argument to prevail in another phase\u201d (quotation\nand brackets omitted)). The plaintiffs made no argument based upon res\njudicata or collateral estoppel. Although the trial court observed that the\nbankruptcy court\u2019s decision on the bank\u2019s motion for relief from stay could\nhave no preclusive effect, it rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 judicial estoppel argument \u2013\nthe only argument asserted by the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs do not appeal the\ntrial court\u2019s ruling on their judicial estoppel argument. Because the plaintiffs\ndid not argue res judicata or collateral estoppel before the trial court, and never\nfiled a motion for reconsideration addressing the trial court\u2019s observation\nregarding the lack of preclusive effect of the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision, we\nconclude that this issue was not properly preserved for appeal. See Singer\nAsset Finance Co. v. Wyner, 156 N.H. 468, 472 (2007) (\u201cIt is a long-standing\nrule that parties may not have judicial review of matters not raised in the\nforum of trial.\u201d (quotation omitted)); see also Gray v. Kelly, 161 N.H. 160, 164\n(2010) (stating that both res judicata and collateral estoppel are affirmative\ndefenses); Super. Ct. Civ. R. 9(d) (recognizing that failure to plead affirmative\ndefenses constitutes waiver).\n\n       Moreover, even assuming that the plaintiffs preserved this argument for\nappeal, they have not persuaded us that res judicata or collateral estoppel bars\nthe bank\u2019s challenge to the husband\u2019s claimed homestead right. Both res\njudicata and collateral estoppel rest upon the principle that, in order for a prior\ndecision to be given preclusive effect against a party as to a particular claim,\nthat party must first have had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the claim.\nSee Kremer v. Chemical Construction Corp., 456 U.S. 461, 480-81 & n.22\n(1982); Gonzalez v. Banco Cent. Corp., 27 F.3d 751, 758 (1st Cir. 1994). When\ndetermining whether a party had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the claim\nin the first proceeding, courts consider the party\u2019s incentive to litigate. See\nParklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 439 U.S. 322, 331-32 (1979) (noting, among\nother factors, that \u201cpetitioners had every incentive to litigate the SEC lawsuit\nfully and vigorously\u201d and concluding that they \u201creceived a \u2018full and fair\u2019\nopportunity to litigate their claims\u201d); S.E.C. v. Monarch Funding Corp., 192\nF.3d 295, 305 (2d Cir. 1999) (considering incentive to litigate with respect to\ncollateral estoppel in sentencing hearings); Restatement (Second) of Judgments\n\u00a7 28 (1982) (recognizing that inadequate \u201copportunity or incentive to obtain a\nfull and fair adjudication in the initial action\u201d is an exception to issue\npreclusion).\n\n     Here, the wife\u2019s amended bankruptcy schedules listed as a \u201cclaim\u201d the\nhusband\u2019s homestead right. This right, however, was based only upon an\n\n\n                                        8\n\f\u201cinchoate and imperfect right\u201d in the property. Cross v. Weare, 62 N.H. 125,\n126 (1882) (quotation omitted). Although the wife\u2019s amended Chapter 13 plan\nincluded a plan to cure her home mortgage arrearage and stated that \u201c[a]ll\nsecured creditors shall retain the liens securing their claims unless otherwise\nstated,\u201d the plan made no mention of the husband\u2019s homestead right.\nTherefore, the husband\u2019s homestead right would only emerge as an issue for\nthe bank if the wife defaulted on the terms of her Chapter 13 plan and if the\nhusband still resided with his wife in the property at the time of default. Under\nthe circumstances, we cannot conclude that the mere possibility of a post-\nconfirmation default provided the bank sufficient incentive to litigate the\nhusband\u2019s homestead claim in the wife\u2019s bankruptcy proceeding. See In re\nCarvalho, 335 F.3d 45, 50 (1st Cir. 2003) (\u201cA debtor\u2019s post-confirmation\ndefault, like many other post-confirmation events, does not come within the\npreclusive reach of a confirmed plan.\u201d); cf. Costanzo v. Harris, 427 P.2d 963,\n967 (Wash. 1967) (declining to require judgment creditor to challenge validity\nof homestead claim before the end of the redemption period because the\ncreditor \u201chas no way to anticipate whether the judgment debtor will choose to\nredeem\u201d). We, therefore, decline to apply res judicata or collateral estoppel to\nbar the bank\u2019s challenge to the husband\u2019s homestead right.\n\nV.    Misstatement in 2006 Mortgage Document\n\n       The plaintiffs also argue that the trial court erred by concluding that the\nmisstatement in the 2006 mortgage, which referenced the wife as a single\nwoman, was without independent legal significance. The trial court found that\nthe reference to the wife as a single woman was an \u201cerroneous representation\u201d\nand concluded that \u201cthe probability is that there was a scrivener\u2019s error with\nrespect to her marital status,\u201d which neither she nor the bank identified. The\nplaintiffs do not dispute these findings; rather, they argue that enforcing the\n2006 mortgage with the error is inconsistent \u201cwith the statutory scheme\nrequiring the mortgagor and his/her spouse, in order to properly encumber the\nhomestead right, to execute the [encumbrance] of a homestead with the\nformalities of a land conveyance.\u201d See RSA 480:5-a. They further assert that\nthe description of the wife\u2019s marital status in the 2006 mortgage document \u201cis\nnot without relevance\u201d because \u201c[r]eferencing the [wife] simply as \u2018a single\nwoman\u2019 presumes that a bona fide purchaser or future mortgagees need look\nno further, perhaps to their peril.\u201d We are not persuaded.\n\n       RSA 480:5-a requires that, to convey or encumber the homestead right, a\ndeed must be executed \u201cwith the formalities required for the conveyance of\nland.\u201d The statutory formalities required for the conveyance of land include\nexecution, acknowledgement, and recording, see RSA 477:1, :3, :3-a (2013), as\nwell as compliance with various notification and disclosure requirements, see\nRSA 477:4-a to :4-h (2013). RSA chapter 477, which sets forth the\nrequirements for conveyances of real estate, does not contain a provision\ninvalidating deeds or mortgages that contain clerical errors, and we will not\n\n\n                                        9\n\fread such a requirement into the statute. See Landry v. Landry, 154 N.H. 785,\n788 (2007). Accordingly, we find no reason to conclude that the erroneous\nreference to the wife\u2019s marital status has any legal significance with respect to\nwhether the 2006 mortgage complied with RSA 480:5-a or to the bank\u2019s ability\nto foreclose on the property.\n\n                                                  Affirmed.\n\n      DALIANIS, C.J., and HICKS, LYNN, and BASSETT, JJ., concurred.\n\n\n\n\n                                       10\n\f"
