I think the space is problem to get the path. Kindly check and clear.\n@echo off\necho.\nset /p J=Enter Journal ID : \nset /p A=Enter Article ID : \nset \"BaseDir=\\\\172.24.191.117\\data1\\NEW-ENDORSEMENTS\\Backlog_checked\\%J%\\CLIENT-SUPPLIED\\Backlog Transfer\\Non EV articles\\%J%%A%\"\nFor /f \"delims=\" %%A in ('\n  Dir /B/S/A-D \"%BaseDir%\\*.zip\" ^| Findstr /I \"\\\\Input_Files\\\\[^\\\\]*\\.zip$\"\n') Do start %%A\npause\n\nA:\n\nReplace start %%A by start \"\" \"%%A\".\nDIR outputs the found file matching the pattern with full qualified file name (file path + file name + file extension) never enclosed in double quotes. So it is necessary to reference the file with embedding it in double quotes as done here with \"%%A\".\nThe first double quoted string is interpreted by command START as optional title. For that reason a title must be explicitly specified to avoid interpreting the full qualified file name in \" as title string. As the started application for opening the *.zip file is most likely a GUI application, an empty title string can be used with \"\" because no command process with a console window is opened in this case.\n\n"
