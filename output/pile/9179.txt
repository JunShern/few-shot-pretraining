I hope you enjoy it and keep coming back. =]\n\nPages\n\nSaturday, June 2, 2012\n\nReview: I Am Number Four: The Lost Files: Nine\u2019s Legacy by Pittacus Lore\n\nPublisher: HarperCollins Publishers\n\nPublication date: 2/28/2012\n\nFormat: eBook\n\nPages: 144\n\nSynopsis:\n\nNumber Nine\u2014when John frees him from his cell in the power of six, he\u2019s ferocious, reckless, and ready to fight back. But being held captive changes a person\u2014even a Lorien. See what Nine was like before his capture, and read about his dramatic escape from his point of view.\n\nIn I Am Number Four: The Lost Files: Nine\u2019s Legacy, discover the story behind Nine. Before meeting John Smith, aka Number Four, before being held prisoner, Nine was hunting down Mogadorians in Chicago with his C\u00capan, Sandor. What happened there would change Nine forever...\n\nMy Thoughts/Review:\n\nI really love these in between books for this series. Authors should really learn to write these short stories more often. I love learning much more details about the characters and the whole series as a whole then if I didn't read these short in between books. This story gives you so much more detail about each member of the Garde then you would get from just reading the book.\n\nNumber Nine's story is really interesting and getting to know him as a character was awesome. You get to learn exactly how he ended up in the situation he was in with the previous book and it sets up the next book really nicely, which I now can't wait to read You learn all about his journey from when they landed on earth and what they have been doing all this time. The story of how he got his legacies is another reason why you should read this book. It would be awesome to have the Garde's legacies in real life.\n\nHis cepan, Sandor was really interesting as well and I loved learning about both of their backgrounds and how they stayed hidden for many years. Also, I really like how Number Nine aka Stanley is really different from the other members of the Garde and how he changes over time, given what has happened to him. It really gives more depth to his character than what was shown in The Power of Six. All of the details that make this whole series so awesome you never would find out unless you read these short stories. That is why I love them so much. If you haven't read both the two in between books yet you definitely should because they are really informative with plently of backstory. Go read them now, they are both really awesome.\n\nOverall, I give this book:\n\nSpectacular, adventurous and magical is what sums up this awesome book. I am so happy that I got the chance to read this book before it comes out in April. Hippocampus really takes you on an adventure that you don't want to leave once the book ends. As you read you learn about Trey Atlas and what happens to him thoughout his journey. You get to learn all about the lost city of Atlantis and all the wonders it has to hold. The one negative about this book was that I wish it was longe\n\nAwesome read, jam-packed with detail that you just can't miss. =]5 out of 5 Stars\n\nThe Army of Ten\n\nGrab my Button\n\nFollow Me on Twitter Here\n\nSubscribe to me on Youtube\n\nAllegiant\n\nReview Policy\n\nIf you want me to review or promote your book or something along that lines on my blog. I would be happy to do so. I like to read a lot of genres. So just send me an email at thebookshelfreview@gmail.com.\nI will get back to you as soon as possible if I am able to review it. I can't guarantee I will read and review the book, if you send it to me. I will try my best though. =]"
