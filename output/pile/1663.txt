Keep in mind that the data is not copied using these tools, but it allows instant access for use cases like yours.\nThere may be some free ways to do this, especially using cloud functions, or maybe linked-clone functions that Virtual Machines offer, but I only know about paid products at this time like Dell EMC, Redgate's and Windocks.\nThe easiest to try that are not in the cloud are:\nRed Gate SQL Clone with a 14 day free trial:\n\nRed Gate SQL Clone Link\nWindocks.com (this is free for some cases, but harder to get started with)\n\n"
