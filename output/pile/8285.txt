This was really weird to me because they\u2019re usually solitary animals,\u201d she tells Australian Geographic.\n\nRelated Video\n\nHer heart broke when she discovered a tiny paw sticking out of the mother\u2019s pouch. She knew she was too late. \u201cIt\u2019s so much worse in winter because they just freeze to death. The only chance the little ones have is if they\u2019re discovered in time.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s much harder for joeys to survive in their mothers pouch during winter. (Image Credit: Wombat rescue)\n\nWombat Rescue\n\nYolandi had been working closely with Donna Stepan from Sleepy Burrows Wombat Sanctuary in Gundaroo, NSW, for 19 months, when she noticed that most orphaned wombats were being brought in from road kills, so she decided to go out looking for herself, going for long drives between dusk and dawn, when wombats are most active.\n\nShe set out to make these drives once or twice every month, but it\u2019s since become an obsession. \u201cLast weekend, I went out twice. I find it really difficult to just sit around when I know a wombat joey is out there waiting for me to rescue it.\u201d\n\nYolandi\u2019s work has since become a family affair. \u201cMy 14-year-old daughter and 12-year-old son are my camera operators. It breaks my heart because my daughter always says \u2018Mum, we missed that road\u2019 or \u2018we haven\u2019t been down there\u2019, but it\u2019s impossible for us to cover every road. Whenever we turn right, we\u2019re anxious we\u2019ve missed one on the left.\u201d\n\nYolandi now posts these videos, as well as photos and other updates on the Wombat Rescue page she uses to educate people about bare-nosed wombats (Vombatus ursinus), which inhabit areas across the east coast. She\u2019s keen to make people aware of the impacts of mange, a severe skin disease that kills wombats and depletes local populations.\n\nHowever, she\u2019s since become equally if not more concerned about the damage caused by car collisions, because people are less aware of how many dead wombats dot NSW rural roads. \u201cThese are healthy wombats being killed, not one\u2019s with mange or anything like that. And the rate that they\u2019re being run over is unsustainable.\u201d\n\n(Image Credit: Wombat Rescue)\n\n\nThe challenges for our wombats\n\nMammal immunologist Julie Old from Western Sydney University began a data collection project called WomSAT, to better understand the toll mange and road collisions are having on wombat populations.\n\n\u201cAt the moment we don\u2019t know much about wombat populations, so it\u2019s hard to say how much impact this is having on them. There is a chance, however, that small populations could become locally extinct.\u201d\n\nFor now, Julie advises anyone who comes across a dead wombat to record their location and submit it through WomSAT. The information collected will help pinpoint where mange is prevalent and where wombats are becoming victims of motor vehicle collisions, and from there, better strategies can be implemented.\n\n\u201cIf people aren\u2019t recording what they see \u2013 the deaths of wombats will go in vain. If they are recorded, the data can be used to help put strategies in place to help. If there\u2019s no data, it\u2019s just hearsay unfortunately.\u201d\n\n\nYolandi hopes the footage her and her two children have recorded will change perceptions. \u201cThe reason why we film everything is to have a record of what we find and to start educating people. It\u2019s going to take time to change people\u2019s perceptions about wombats because they don\u2019t know them as well as other marsupials. But I am determined to change perceptions and to make a difference.\u201d"
