How do I hide all the categories I don't want from the list?\n\nA:\n\nBy default, the categories that are displayed in the list are unfiltered. This means that every category in the store should show up - so this is behaving as it should.\nWhat you probably want to add is a filter to the category list.\nAdd a filter using the Filter property of the category list. If you only want the root categories (your primary store categories), a filter on the category ParentId is probably the most appropriate. Use the root category id as the value for this filter. If you're unsure what your root category id is, just leave it empty.\n\n"
