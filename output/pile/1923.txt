What everyone here is forgetting is\nthat we are a pretty focused demographic of technical people. If you ask the\naverage CNN user what Dropbox is you'll probably get a blank stare. The fact\nthat an article like this is BEING written is just another sign of Dropbox's\nsuccess... it may be crossing the tipping point to main-stream media and\nadoption outside of the tech community. I bet if you looked you would have\nfound something similar about Twitter at some point where social media savvy\npeople were going \"WTF? I've used it forever\"\n\n~~~\nJonnieCache\n_> cloud computing -- that catchall phrase corporations use to describe\nservices delivered via the Internet_\n\nWith this line they are streets ahead of most pure tech sites in terms of\naccuracy.\n\n~~~\nch0wn\nI love Dropbox for not using this horrible term.\n\n~~~\nnbashaw\nHorrible term? Just because it's the catch phrase du jour doesn't mean it's\ntotally meaningless. I get annoyed with the buzz and malapropism just as much\nas the next guy, but like it or not, cloud computing is a major global\nphenomenon.\n\n~~~\niamdave\nIt IS a meaningless phrase in the sense that it's being used.\n\nWhen I was studying network engineering, \"the cloud\" used to encompass the\nbroader network environment that INCLUDED the Internet as an extension of your\nenterprise infrastructure. Now? It's a hyperbolic, singular phrase that is\nlimited to using the internet as an extension of your operating system without\nfully explaining or at least detailing for the end user why it matters.\n\nEspecially in the case of those god.awful Microsoft commercials. In their\ncase, the way it's presented, the cloud is nothing less synonymous with social\nnetworking. Change your Facebook status from Windows? That's the cloud. Upload\na picture to Flickr? That's the cloud. It's no better than that phase of 'web\n2.0' that was nothing more than superficial design elements that included\nshiny buttons, dropping vowels and slapping the term 'beta' on everything. The\nweb is cyclical and this is the latest cycle.\n\nWhile that in and of itself isn't BAD per se, it's a phrase that's come\nsynonymous with \"rockstar\" and \"ninja\" when talking about hiring developers. A\ntotal and complete non sequitur.\n\n------\nSwellJoe\nI've been shocked at how often I see the Dropbox icon on friend's systems. I\nno longer live in silicon valley, and so I am completely out of the echo\nchamber (except what I read here at HN). These are not nerds, not techies, and\nnot people who follow TechCrunch. These are artists, musicians, old folks,\nnomads, and all sorts of folks that just don't do technology. But, they get\nDropbox. Admittedly, my parents aren't using Dropbox, but my parents don't\nread CNN.com, either, and I can't imagine what they would even use Dropbox\nfor. I can't even get them to use flickr for photos, despite buying them a\ndigital camera (my mom still uses a film camera when she travels because she's\nafraid she'll lose or break the digital one).\n\nIf I could invest in Dropbox, I would. But, that wasn't always true. I met\nDrew at a YC party before they had anything to show, and were still figuring\nout the diffing/versioning problems, and all the underlying hard problems.\nAnd, I came away thinking, \"Well, that's been done before. A lot. And it never\nwent anywhere.\" I had even built a little web-based file manager and sharing\napp as a RoR practice app, a couple weeks before. So, I thought I knew a\nbusiness that wouldn't go anywhere when I saw it. I thought highly of Drew,\nbut not much of the idea. I was obviously very wrong about the idea.\n\nAnyway, my point is, Dropbox hasn't been something \"you've never heard of\" for\nquite some time.\n\n~~~\ndaeken\nMy dad is using Dropbox to share his songs. He saves to Dropbox, and then\nshares links on Facebook. All his masters are backed up there as well.\n\n------\nkrschultz\nMajor news outlet learns about cheaper way to share files from their intern\nwho uses it at school like everyone else: News at 11\n\n------\nrayvega\n>> _\"...And there's little to stop...Amazon (AMZN), with its own Amazon Web\nServices, from making a greater push into Dropbox's territory....\"_\n\nDropbox actually runs on AWS by using Amazon's S3 for storage. This is what\nallowed them to get up and running quickly and cheaply without needing a lot\nof venture funding.\n\nI would not be surprised with Dropbox's continued growth, if they in the\nfuture were to set up and manage their own data centers to avoid being\ndependent on Amazon or anyone else's platform. This would be advantageous if\nAmazon were to decide to compete directly with a similar product.\n\n~~~\nbradleyland\nSomeone questioned whether Dropbox could compete with Amazon at scale, but\ndecided to delete it. This is a really valid question. I recalled a while back\nthat Backblaze asked a similar question and came up with a really cool\nsolution.\n\n[http://blog.backblaze.com/2009/09/01/petabytes-on-a-\nbudget-h...](http://blog.backblaze.com/2009/09/01/petabytes-on-a-budget-how-\nto-build-cheap-cloud-storage/)\n\nI see this as Dropbox's future. PaaS is good for getting started, but with\nnumbers like what's shown in that blog post, it's hard to argue that something\nlike S3 is really priced at commodity levels.\n\n------\n6ren\ncounterpoint: Dropbox is a great product, clever tech, insightful marketing\netc. Even the YC application was great. And I think there's a large market\n(even its present size is more than enough to sate my own avarice), but... it\ndoesn't seem that it could become a truly _huge_ company (like Xerox, Google),\nwithout launching a series of increasingly unrelated products. Though perhaps\nthat's true of many huge companies (e.g. Apple, Sony, HP - even Microsoft has\nOffice).\n\n~~~\nlemon_pie\npossibly. that said, 100m in revenue 4 years after launch with a fairly\nunbounded market (every consumer), looks like quite the promising start.\n\n~~~\n6ren\n> Benioff predicts sales could hit $100 million this year. (The company\n> declined to comment.)\n\nUnfortunately, a prediction; and also by someone not privy to actual\nfigures...\n\n> Dropbox reportedly experiences well over 10 times year-over-year growth...\n\nSounds pretty good!\n\n> ...and positive cash flow.\n\nThe mildest expression of profitability possible. Though I'm pretty sure\nthey're doing way better than >0.\n\nFrom scanning many acquisitions, my feeling is of the order of $200 million.\nThough I'm basing that mainly on business acquisition (e.g. by Oracle), so I\nmight be very off for consumer acquisitions (considering youtube, facebook,\ntwitter etc).\n\n~~~\nwlievens\nWith their kind of scalability, any positive cash flow is awesome news.\n\n------\nspatten\nWhen we were trying to figure out if Dropbox would be a good sync tool for\nLeanpub, Peter went in to a local coffee shop and asked a bunch of people if\nthey'd ever heard of Dropbox. All of the baristas and everyone else in their\n20s had, and had accounts. About half of the people 30 or older had heard of\nit, and most of them had accounts.\n\nWe were pretty impressed with the numbers, and we ended up going with Dropbox,\nand we've never regretted it.\n\n------\ntechnomancy\n> The hottest startup you've never heard of\n\nI wish this were true; unfortunately I hear lots and lots about them when they\nrun a \"spam your friends for more free space\" promotional.\n\n~~~\njrockway\nGet better friends.\n\n------\njustinxreese\nExpected an article from 4 years ago...\n\n------\ndjacobs\nExcellent, if my non-technical friends ever ask why I don't go to mainstream\nmedia for tech news, I'll point them to this article.\n\n------\ndanielha\nMy dad uses Dropbox and I didn't even tell him about it. Such a badass\ncompany.\n\n~~~\nrokhayakebe\nEven more badass is your dad.\n\n------\nflexd\nMy mom came to me earlier asking me to help her install Dropbox. She's about\nas informed about computer stuff as i am about fashion. That's a good sign for\nDropbox :-)\n\n~~~\nTomek_\nMy mom did the same, except she called using Skype :)\n\n------\nzaidf\nWhile I'm sure Dropbox has their work cut out, you know they are onto\nsomething when you run into their flyers outside college dorms cross country\nin Chapel Hill, NC.\n\n~~~\ntom_b\nHey, there are even old boring people walking around on campus who are users .\n. . heck, even in _Carrboro_\n\nIf it wasn't a HIPPA issue, we might be using Dropbox for more internal\nprojects here\n\nLove, love, love dropbox. You undergrad at Sitterson?\n\n~~~\nzaidf\nNah, just got my communications(!) degree and moved up to NYC :)\n\n------\nzandorg\nToday I was at a University small business lecture. Someone asked one of the\nentrepreneurs \"What was your biggest mistake?\". The guy said his laptop had\nbeen stolen, but luckily it was all auto-backed up onto Dropbox. A nice\nanecdote and good press!\n\n------\njprobert\nI love dropbox and we use it personally and for our company (we are paid\nsubscribers). But it seems to me that this space has fewer barriers to entry\nthan say Groupon. People argue that Groupon has little barriers to entry but\nthe fact is that it cost a lot to sell and get merchants on board. Dropbox is\na very unique and helpful product but what will stop the competition from\ncreating something similar and possibly better?\n\n------\njoeag\nNow is maybe the really scary time for Dropbox - here come the \"me too's\"\nincluding corporates who will say \"Hey looks like people are starting to want\nthis file storage and sharing thingy\" - we can do that too and offer it to our\nown customers.\n\nShould be interesting.\n\n~~~\nDufusM\nMicrosoft already tried their hand at it with Windows Live Mesh. Technically\nApple's MobileMe is the same thing. The 'corporates' are already on it :)\n\n------\ndidip\nDropbox is awesome, I use it, I love it.\n\nI had the same thought as SwellJoe around early 2008: That's been done, it\nain't gonna go anywhere big. Obviously failed prediction on my part.\n\nSo the question is, what made Dropbox successful? There are plenty of players\nin this area (some of them are older than dropbox): box.net, mozy.com, Windows\nLive mesh, backblaze.\n\nFurthermore, techies can easily do backup to their own S3 account, but they\nlove Dropbox.\n\nWhat's the success factors? YC? Being MIT graduates? The clever \"Tell your\nfriends and get more space for free\" email? The market is just HUGE?\n\nI know that 1 of them is using Python. =)\n\n------\norionlogic\nI like Dropbox but i use it less often. What i am waiting for is the same\nsolution from Apple. Their cloud facility has been just finished and they will\nprobably offer similar service not later than this year. It might not start as\npure storage facility but will start by account and device activation from\ncloud, iphoto & music backup and then after figuring out how this cloud thing\nwork will probably offer similar subscription fee based service. After all why\nthey still didn't buy Dropbox? Probably they are working on it.\n\n------\nsunqiang\nThere is a PyCon video about Dropbox: PyCon 2011: How Dropbox Did It and How\nPython Helped <http://pycon.blip.tv/file/4878722/>\n\n------\nbfe\nI'm glad the article pointed out the cartoon dinosaur riding a shark on the\njobs page, even though they mistook it as not taking things seriously, instead\nof convincingly signalling, by the fact of its nature and presence (as an\nawesome and surprising drawing on a recruitment page that's subversive of\nconventional expectations for a potential employer), the claim made in the\nheading on that page, that Dropbox is a pretty sweet place to work.\n\n------\nubercore\nWe've been using it for our band, and it's been working great. A really useful\ntool that the non-techy members have had no trouble adopting.\n\n------\nRRiccio\nDropbox it's certainly one of the most helpful startups for the average guy.\n\nI put into use at the last company I was working for (a non-tech company) and\neveryone got immediately hooked on Dropbox. It made their file-sharing much\neasier.\n\nSo I honestly understand this article, even though for us it's been around for\nso long.\n\n------\nakent\nAny media outlet tempted to use a \"you've never heard of\" headline should\nseriously reconsider. Guaranteed to irritate everyone who HAS heard of it\ninstantly.\n\n~~~\nwhatusername\nI heard a radio report in NZ over summer about the kids these days using words\nlike Cool and Wicked in ways that weren't their original meaning.\n\nSomeone deserves a medal for epic trolling. (I don't know what the station was\n-- I was in a hire car and channel surfing and decided to listen to the news\nbroadcast)\n\n------\nkylelibra\nThis is why traditional / mainstream media is fighting a battle to remain\nrelevant.\n\n~~~\nVivtek\nThis they call fighting?\n\n~~~\nTomek_\nCertainly better than their previous attempts:\n[http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/mon-\nfebruary-28-2011/the-b...](http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/mon-\nfebruary-28-2011/the-biggest-newser)\n\n------\njpr\nFinally something I can be hipster about.\n\n------\npetervandijck\nEh, \"you've never heard of\"?\n\n~~~\nFlorin_Andrei\nIt's CNN, it's for normal people.\n\n~~~\npetervandijck\nAh normal people. Got it.\n\n"
