No. S-17-1210.\n\n                 1. Paternity: Appeal and Error. In a filiation proceeding, questions con-\n                    cerning child custody determinations are reviewed on appeal de novo on\n                    the record to determine whether there has been an abuse of discretion\n                    by the trial court, whose judgment will be upheld in the absence of an\n                    abuse of discretion.\n                 2. Judges: Words and Phrases. A judicial abuse of discretion exists if the\n                    reasons or rulings of a trial judge are clearly untenable, unfairly depriv-\n                    ing a litigant of a substantial right and denying just results in matters\n                    submitted for disposition.\n                 3. Evidence: Appeal and Error. In a de novo review, when the evidence\n                    is in conflict, the appellate court considers, and may give weight to, the\n                    fact that the trial court heard and observed the witnesses and accepted\n                    one version of the facts rather than another.\n                 4. Child Custody: Visitation. The Parenting Act does not require any\n                    particular parenting time schedule to accompany an award of either sole\n                    or joint physical custody, and there exists a broad continuum of possible\n                    parenting time schedules that can be in a child\u2019s best interests.\n                 5. Child Custody: Visitation: Words and Phrases. An alternating week-\n                    on-week-off parenting time schedule requires the child to spend roughly\n                    the same amount of time at each parent\u2019s residence and allows both\n                    parents to exert continuous blocks of parenting time for significant\n                    periods of time, and thus meets the statutory definition of joint physi-\n                    cal custody.\n                 6. Child Custody: Visitation. Where a parenting plan effectively estab-\n                    lishes a joint physical custody arrangement, courts will so construe it,\n                    regardless of how prior decrees or court orders have characterized the\n                    arrangement.\n\f                                     - 934 -\n              Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                      303 Nebraska R eports\n              STATE ON BEHALF OF KAADEN S. v. JEFFERY T.\n                          Cite as 303 Neb. 933\n\n 7. Divorce: Child Custody. The Parenting Act authorizes a trial court to\n    award joint custody in dissolution actions if the court specifically finds,\n    after a hearing in open court, that joint physical custody or joint legal\n    custody, or both, is in the best interests of the minor child regardless of\n    any parental agreement or consent.\n 8. Courts: Appeal and Error. The doctrine of stare decisis requires that\n    appellate courts adhere to their previous decisions unless the reasons\n    therefor have ceased to exist, are clearly erroneous, or are manifestly\n    wrong and mischievous or unless more harm than good will result from\n    doing so. The doctrine is entitled to great weight, but it does not require\n    courts to blindly perpetuate a prior interpretation of the law if it was\n    clearly incorrect.\n 9. Child Custody: Judges. A blanket rule disfavoring joint physical cus-\n    tody is inconsistent with the Parenting Act and unnecessarily constrains\n    the discretion of trial judges in some of the most important and difficult\n    decisions they are called upon to make.\n10. Child Custody. Joint physical custody is neither favored nor disfavored\n    under Nebraska law. In fact, no custody or parenting time arrangement\n    is either favored or disfavored as a matter of law.\n11. ____. When determining the best interests of the child in deciding cus-\n    tody, a court must consider, at a minimum, (1) the relationship of the\n    minor child to each parent prior to the commencement of the action;\n    (2) the desires and wishes of a sufficiently mature child, if based on\n    sound reasoning; (3) the general health, welfare, and social behavior\n    of the child; (4) credible evidence of abuse inflicted on any family or\n    household member; and (5) credible evidence of child abuse or neglect\n    or domestic intimate partner abuse.\n12. Visitation. The Parenting Act provides that the best interests of a\n    child require a parenting plan that provides for a child\u2019s safety, emo-\n    tional growth, health, stability, physical care, and regular school attend\u00ad\n    ance, and which promotes a child\u2019s continued contact with his or her\n    families and parents who have shown the ability to act in the child\u2019s\n    best interests.\n13. ____. When determining the allocation of parenting time that is in a\n    child\u2019s best interests, a trial court should consider the parties\u2019 ability to\n    communicate on issues such as transportation, homework, discipline,\n    medical and dental appointments, and extracurricular activities. Other\n    relevant considerations include stability in the child\u2019s routine, mini-\n    malization of contact and conflict between the parents, and the general\n    nature and health of the individual child. The fact that one parent might\n    interfere with the other\u2019s relationship with the child is also a factor to\n    consider, but is not a determinative factor.\n\f                                  - 935 -\n              Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                      303 Nebraska R eports\n              STATE ON BEHALF OF KAADEN S. v.

The Nebraska Child\n    Support Guidelines require child support orders to address how the par-\n    ents will provide for the child\u2019s health insurance.\n15. ____: ____. Neb. Ct. R. \u00a7 4-215(B) of the Nebraska Child Support\n    Guidelines estimates $480 as an ordinary amount of nonreimbursed\n    medical expenses, and that figure is then subsumed within the amount\n    of child support that is ordered. Any nonreimbursed expenses exceeding\n    $480 are prorated between the parties.\n16. ____: ____. Child support payments should generally be set according\n    to the child support guidelines.\n\n   Petition for further review from the Court of Appeals,\nPirtle, R iedmann, and Welch, Judges, on appeal thereto from\nthe District Court for Jefferson County, R icky A.

Child support\nwas calculated using a joint custody worksheet, and the father\nwas ordered to pay monthly support. The father appealed,\nassigning multiple errors, including that the award of nearly\nequal parenting time was, in effect, an award of joint physical\ncustody and was an abuse of discretion. The Nebraska Court of\nAppeals agreed, and it reversed and remanded with directions\nto modify the mother\u2019s parenting time so it was \u201cconsistent\nwith an award of primary physical custody\u201d to the father.1 In\n\n1\n    State on behalf of Kaaden S. v.

JEFFERY T.\n                           Cite as 303 Neb. 933\n\ndoing so, the Court of Appeals relied on Nebraska precedent\nholding that joint physical custody is disfavored and should be\nreserved for rare cases.2 We granted the mother\u2019s petition for\nfurther review to reexamine that precedent.3\n   We now hold that a blanket rule disfavoring joint physical\ncustody is inconsistent with the Parenting Act,4 which requires\nthat all determinations of custody and parenting time be based\non factors affecting the best interests of the child. We thus\ndisapprove of our prior rule disfavoring joint physical custody,\nand we clarify that Nebraska law neither favors nor disfa-\nvors any particular custody arrangement and instead requires\nall such determinations to be based on the best interests of\nthe child.\n   When the custody and parenting time in the instant case are\nreviewed under this standard, we find no abuse of discretion.\nWe thus reverse the Court of Appeals\u2019 determination to the\ncontrary and remand the matter with directions to affirm the\njudgment of the district court as it regards custody, parenting\ntime, and child support.\n                           I. FACTS\n   Kaaden S. was born to Mandy S. and Jeffery T. in June 2014.\nThe parents did not have a dating relationship either before or\nafter conception. Mandy notified Jeffery of her pregnancy, and\nJeffery was at the hospital on the day Kaaden was born.\n   In February 2015, the State filed a paternity action against\nJeffery in the district court for Jefferson County, including\nMandy as a third-party defendant.

Mandy\u2019s responsive pleading\nadmitted Jeffery was Kaaden\u2019s father and requested sole legal\nand physical custody of Kaaden. Genetic testing later con-\nfirmed Jeffery was Kaaden\u2019s biological father.\n   In July 2015, the district court entered an order finding\nJeffery was Kaaden\u2019s father, but reserved the issues of custody,\nparenting time, and child support pending further hearing.\nApproximately 1 year later, when Kaaden was nearly 2 years\nold, the district court entered an order establishing temporary\nchild support and parenting time. The temporary order allowed\nJeffery supervised, nonovernight visits for 60 days and then\nprogressed to give Jeffery parenting time every other weekend\nand on Wednesday evenings.\n   Mandy did not comply with the temporary order and con-\nsistently refused to allow Jeffery overnight parenting time with\nKaaden. Jeffery sought to have Mandy held in contempt of\ncourt for failing to comply with the temporary order, and the\ncontempt matter was set to be taken up at the time of trial.\n   Generally, as Jeffery\u2019s parenting time with Kaaden\nincreased, the quality of the interaction between Mandy and\nJeffery decreased. In November 2016, Jeffery made an audio\nrecording of a particularly contentious interaction with Mandy\nthat occurred during an exchange of Kaaden. In the record-\ning, Mandy can be heard yelling at Jeffery and belittling his\nattempts to build a relationship with Kaaden. During this\ninteraction, Mandy pepper-sprayed Jeffery in the face and then\ncalled police to report she had been assaulted. Jeffery played\nthe recording for the officers, and no arrest was made.\n   After this incident, it became even more difficult for Mandy\nand Jeffery to communicate. Exchanges for parenting time\noccurred at the sheriff\u2019s office, but remained contentious.\nThe parties twice attempted to mediate the issues of custody,\nparenting time, and child support, but both times, Mandy\nrefused to sit in the same room with Jeffery and no agreement\nwas reached.\n\f                             - 938 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                   303 Nebraska R eports\n           STATE ON BEHALF OF KAADEN S. v. JEFFERY T.\n                       Cite as 303 Neb. 933\n\n                              1. Trial\n   In May 2017, trial was held on the issues of custody and\nparenting time, child support, and contempt of the temporary\norder. Jeffery, whose pleadings originally had requested joint\ncustody, sought primary physical custody of Kaaden at trial.\nHe testified that if awarded primary custody, he would support\nMandy and Kaaden\u2019s relationship and adhere to any parenting\ntime order imposed. He also asked that Kaaden\u2019s surname be\nchanged to his surname.\n   Mandy testified that she did not think joint custody would\nwork because she and Jeffery did not communicate well,\nthough she thought that would improve once the litigation was\nconcluded. She asked to be awarded sole legal and physical\ncustody of Kaaden and proposed that Jeffery have parenting\ntime every other weekend. She requested continued child sup-\nport and opposed changing Kaaden\u2019s surname. Mandy admitted\nshe had not adhered to the parenting plan under the temporary\norder, but she testified that Kaaden was scared and did not\nwant to have visits with Jeffery. She said that around the time\nthat Jeffery\u2019s parenting time was to increase under the tempo-\nrary order, Kaaden began exhibiting behavioral problems, so\nshe took him to see a counselor.\n   Kaaden\u2019s counselor testified at trial. She initially diagnosed\nKaaden with \u201cseparation trauma and extreme anxiety,\u201d but\ntestified he showed significant growth over the 5 months she\nworked with him. The counselor had no concerns about Mandy\nas a custodial parent, but offered the opinion that it was best\nfor Kaaden that contact between Mandy and Jeffery be limited.\nAccording to the counselor, Mandy had \u201csignificant unresolved\nissues\u201d toward Jeffery, and she recommended Mandy partici-\npate in treatment to address it. The counselor had no opinion\non the feasibility of joint custody, but did have a recommenda-\ntion regarding future parenting time. She recommended that\nafter a transition period, Jeffery\u2019s parenting time should be\n\u201cweek on, week off . . . until [Kaaden] reaches middle school\ngrade age.\u201d\n\f                              - 939 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                   303 Nebraska R eports\n           STATE ON BEHALF OF KAADEN S. v. JEFFERY T.\n                       Cite as 303 Neb. 933\n\n   Before trial, the court appointed an attorney to serve as the\nguardian ad litem (GAL) for Kaaden. The GAL attended trial\nbut did not testify. Instead, she was ordered by the court to sub-\nmit a recommendation and written report, which was received\ninto evidence after trial. No party objected to this procedure\nbefore the trial court.\n   The GAL\u2019s report detailed that she had met with both par-\nties and their counsel, visited Kaaden at both parties\u2019 homes,\nobserved exchanges of Kaaden during parenting time, and\ninterviewed more than a dozen people including a nationally\nrecognized expert in the area of parental alienation, members\nof Mandy\u2019s family, and friends and acquaintances of Jeffery.\nThe GAL described the case as \u201cone of the most difficult\ncases [she had] worked on in 20 years of being appointed as\na [GAL].\u201d Her report stated she was \u201ccompletely confident in\nmaking the recommendation that Kaaden\u2019s primary physical\ncustody be awarded to . . . Jeffery.\u201d The GAL believed that\nMandy\u2019s \u201cloathing\u201d of Jeffery was harmful to Kaaden and\nthat Mandy\u2019s pattern of \u201cparental alienation\u201d was unlikely to\nchange. The GAL expressed the opinion that \u201cit would be in\nKaaden\u2019s best interests to be in a parent\u2019s custody [who] is\ngoing to make a good faith effort to work with the other parent\nand not sabotage Kaaden\u2019s relationship with that parent.\u201d\n                 (a) Custody and Parenting Time\n   The trial court\u2019s order summarized the evidence adduced\nat trial and generally found that both parents were fit and had\nformed a good relationship with Kaaden. But the court noted:\n          The complicating factor in this matter is the lack of a\n      relationship between the parents, both prior to Kaaden\u2019s\n      conception and continuing, and the obvious resentment\n      Mandy has towards Jeff[er]y and the situation in which\n      she now finds herself. Mandy testified that she believes\n      Kaaden needs his father in his life and does not believe\n      that Jeffery abuses Kaaden in any fashion, although she\n      . . . appears to do everything she can to limit or monitor\n      Jeff[er]y and Kaaden\u2019s relationship. The record reflects\n\f                          - 940 -\n      Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n              303 Nebraska R eports\n      STATE ON BEHALF OF KAADEN S. v. JEFFERY T.\n                  Cite as 303 Neb. 933\n\nthat she has done everything in her power to prevent\nJeff[er]y from being a father to Kaaden by contesting and\nlitigating every attempt he has made to do so. Mandy\u2019s\ntestimony at trial indicated that while she wanted to\nbe a mother at some point in her life she did not envi-\nsion it happening in this fashion nor was this part of\nher plan. That said, it\u2019s obvious she loves Kaaden. Her\nanger towards Jeff[er]y, unfortunately, clouds her judg-\nment regarding what is in Kaaden\u2019s best interests at\ntimes, especially when it comes to allowing Jeffery to be\ninvolved in his life.\n    Mandy and Jeff[er]y both provide safe and appropriate\nhomes for Kaaden where he enjoys a healthy diet, has a\nbed to sleep in, and toys and activities to keep him occu-\npied and engaged.\n    ....\n    The court has addressed the parties, on the record, dur-\ning the pendency of this matter. Each time I addressed\nthem I tried to remind them that Kaaden\u2019s interests are\nbest served by having both of his parents involved in his\nlife, and tried to encourage Mandy to see past her hurt,\nfear, and anger and allow Kaaden to have his father in his\nlife. Unfortunately, the report from [the GAL] indicates\nthose words went in one ear and out the other because\nnothing has changed with her behavior. It appears she is\nstill putting more value on her hate and anger than she is\non Kaaden\u2019s ability to have a father actively engaged in\nhis life and the benefits of that relationship.\n    For the reasons stated above, as well as the firm belief\nthat doing so best ensures compliance with the order of\ncustody so that Kaaden can enjoy the full benefits of\nhaving both parents involved in his life to the greatest\ndegree possible, the court finds that it is in Kaaden\u2019s best\ninterests that primary legal and primary physical custody\nbe awarded to . . .

The parenting plan described the\ncustody award as follows:\n      The father shall have sole legal and physical custody of\n      the minor child and, as such, shall have the legal respon-\n      sibility and authority to make final decisions concerning\n      the parenting functions necessary to raising the child.\n         . . . The principal place of residence (physical custody)\n      of the child shall be with the father, (custodial parent)\n      subject to the terms of this Plan.\n   The court-created parenting plan provided that after a brief\ntransition period, Mandy and Jeffery would have parenting\ntime in alternating 1-week blocks. Exchanges were to occur\neach Friday at 6 p.m. at the sheriff\u2019s office. The plan addressed\nholidays and gave each parent 2 uninterrupted weeks of sum-\nmer parenting time.\n             (b) Child Support and Nonreimbursed\n                       Health Care Costs\n   The court used worksheet 3 of the Nebraska Child Support\nGuidelines, the joint custody worksheet, to calculate child sup-\nport, and the completed worksheet was attached to the decree.\nIn allocating the number of overnights for each parent (line\n5 on the worksheet), the court attributed 182 days to Mandy\nand 183 days to Jeffery. Jeffery was ordered to pay child sup-\nport of $93 per month and to provide health insurance for\nKaaden. He was also ordered to pay the first $480 of Kaaden\u2019s\nnonreimbursed reasonable and necessary health care expenses\neach year, and Mandy was ordered to pay 50 percent of such\nexpenses in excess of $480.\n                (c) Name Change, Contempt,\n                      and Attorney Fees\n  Jeffery\u2019s request to change Kaaden\u2019s surname was denied.\nThe court found Mandy in willful contempt for failing to\ncomply with the terms of the temporary order and imposed a\n\f                                 - 942 -\n             Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                     303 Nebraska R eports\n              STATE ON BEHALF OF KAADEN S. v.

Finally, the\ncourt declined to award attorney fees and ordered the parties to\npay their own fees and costs.\n                       2. Court of A ppeals\n   Jeffery appealed, assigning that the district court erred in\n(1) ordering equal parenting time, (2) calculating child sup-\nport using the joint custody worksheet, (3) ordering him to\npay the first $480 in nonreimbursed health care expenses, (4)\nrefusing to change Kaaden\u2019s surname, (5) imposing a nominal\nfine for Mandy\u2019s contempt, and (6) denying his request for\nattorney fees.\n   The Court of Appeals found no merit to the arguments\nregarding the name change or attorney fees. But it agreed with\nJeffery that the district court erred in its determinations regard-\ning parenting time, child support, nonreimbursed health care\nexpenses, and contempt. We summarize the court\u2019s reason-\ning below.\n                (a) Custody and Parenting Time\n   Before the Court of Appeals, Jeffery claimed the district\ncourt\u2019s parenting plan was \u201cessentially a Joint Physical Custody\nPlan,\u201d5 which he argued was an abuse of discretion. The Court\nof Appeals agreed. It acknowledged that the district court had\nawarded primary physical custody to Jeffery, but it concluded\nthat by giving Mandy nearly equal parenting time, the district\ncourt effectively imposed \u201cthe standard joint physical custody\narrangement.\u201d6 In considering whether such an arrangement\nwas an abuse of discretion, the Court of Appeals relied on this\ncourt\u2019s precedent which holds:\n      Joint physical custody should be reserved for those cases\n      where, in the judgment of the trial court, the parents are\n      of such maturity that the arrangement will not operate to\n\n5\n    Brief for appellant at 22.\n6\n    State on behalf of Kaaden S., supra note 1, 26 Neb.

It thus affirmed the award of primary legal and\nphysical custody to Jeffery, but reversed the parenting plan and\nremanded the matter to the district court to implement a parent-\ning time schedule \u201cconsistent with an award of primary physi-\ncal custody to Jeffery.\u201d9 It did not indicate what the parameters\nof such a plan must be.\n           (b) Child Support and Medical Expenses\n   Because the matter was being remanded to reduce Mandy\u2019s\nparenting time, the Court of Appeals also found the trial\ncourt\u2019s use of the joint custody worksheet to calculate child\nsupport was in error. It therefore reversed the child support\naward and remanded the matter for recalculation \u201cusing the\nappropriate worksheet.\u201d10 The Court of Appeals also reversed\nthe provision in the decree requiring Jeffery to pay the first\n$480 of Kaaden\u2019s nonreimbursed health care expenses. It rea-\nsoned that children\u2019s health care expenses are specifically\nincluded in the child support guidelines amount of up to $480\nper child per year11 and that consequently, any nonreimbursed\nhealth care costs up to $480 were subsumed within the amount\nof child support ordered.12 It directed the trial court, upon\n\n 7\n     Id., citing Erin W., supra note 2.\n 8\n     Id. at 433, 920 N.W.2d at 50.\n 9\n     Id. at 430, 920 N.W.2d at 48.\n10\n     Id. at 433, 920 N.W.2d at 50.\n11\n     See Neb.

ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   On further review, Mandy assigns, restated, that the Court of\nAppeals erred in (1) reversing the parenting plan and remand-\ning the matter with instructions to reduce Mandy\u2019s parenting\ntime, (2) finding the record did not support joint physical\ncustody when the district court created a parenting plan that\ngave Mandy \u201cde facto\u201d13 joint physical custody, and (3) revers-\ning the child support calculation and the requirement that\nJeffery pay the first $480 of Kaaden\u2019s nonreimbursed health\ncare expenses.\n                 III.

ANALYSIS\n   In her first two assignments of error, Mandy argues the\nCourt of Appeals erred in reversing the parenting time schedule\nand remanding the matter with directions to reduce her parent-\ning time. After reexamining our jurisprudence, we agree.\n   As noted, the district court awarded Jeffery \u201cprimary\u201d legal\nand physical custody of Kaaden and imposed a parenting plan\nthat gave Mandy nearly equal parenting time. The Court of\nAppeals relied on its own precedent17 and precedent from this\ncourt18 to conclude that an award of nearly equal parenting\ntime amounted to an award of de facto joint physical custody.\nIt found such a custody arrangement was an abuse of discre-\ntion, relying on the legal proposition that joint physical cus-\ntody is disfavored and should be reserved for rare cases.19 We\ngranted further review to reexamine that proposition. Before\ndoing so, we set out the legal framework that governs child\ncustody determinations in Nebraska.\n                       1. Legal Custody\n   Under the Parenting Act adopted by the Nebraska Legislature,\nthe concept of child custody encompasses both \u201clegal custody\nand physical custody.\u201d20 \u201cLegal custody\u201d focuses entirely on\n\n15\n     Leners v.

As such, Jeffery has the final say\non fundamental decisions regarding Kaaden\u2019s welfare, such as\nwhere he attends school, his religious upbringing, and how his\nhealth and medical needs are met.22 Because Kaaden\u2019s legal\ncustody is not at issue in this appeal, we focus our analysis on\nthe issues of physical custody and parenting time.\n\n            2. Physical Custody and Parenting Time\n   \u201cPhysical custody\u201d is defined by the Parenting Act as\n\u201cauthority and responsibility regarding the child\u2019s place of\nresidence and the exertion of continuous parenting time for\nsignificant periods of time.\u201d23 As such, although the Parenting\nAct does not speak in terms of \u201csole\u201d or \u201cprimary\u201d physical\ncustody, it contemplates that an award of physical custody will\ndetermine the child\u2019s primary residence and identify the parent\nwho will exert \u201csignificant\u201d and \u201ccontinuous\u201d parenting time\nover the child.24\n   \u201cJoint physical custody\u201d as defined by the Parenting Act\nmeans \u201cmutual authority and responsibility of the parents\nregarding the child\u2019s place of residence and the exertion of\ncontinuous blocks of parenting time by both parents over the\nchild for significant periods of time.\u201d25 The Parenting Act does\nnot further define either \u201csignificant periods of time\u201d or \u201ccon-\ntinuous blocks,\u201d but it does define \u201cparenting time.\u201d26\n\n21\n     \u00a7 43-2922(13).\n22\n     See id.\n23\n     \u00a7 43-2922(20).\n24\n     See id.\n25\n     \u00a7 43-2922(12).\n26\n     See id.\n\f                                     - 947 -\n               Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                       303 Nebraska R eports\n                STATE ON BEHALF OF KAADEN S. v.

Nebraska has a number of appellate cases in which\nthe parties disagreed over whether a particular custody and\nparenting time arrangement was properly characterized as sole\nphysical custody with liberal parenting time or as joint physi-\ncal custody.30 But in this case, that analysis is not difficult,\nand both parties concede the court effectively imposed a joint\nphysical custody arrangement. We agree.\n   [5] The district court awarded the parents nearly equal par-\nenting time in the form of an alternating week-on-week-off\n\n27\n     \u00a7 43-2922(19).\n28\n     \u00a7 43-2922(17).\n29\n     Id.\n30\n     See, e.g., Dooling v.

Such a schedule requires Kaaden to spend roughly\nthe same amount of time at each parent\u2019s residence and allows\nboth parents to exert continuous blocks of parenting time for\nsignificant periods of time, and thus meets the statutory defini-\ntion of joint physical custody.31\n   [6] Where a parenting plan effectively establishes a joint\nphysical custody arrangement, courts will so construe it,\nregardless of how prior decrees or court orders have charac-\nterized the arrangement.32 In several cases, we have looked\npast the labels used by the trial court when describing the\nphysical custody arrangement and have focused instead on the\nactual terms of the parenting plan adopted by the court.33 Such\ncases illustrate that it is the trial court\u2019s allocation of parent-\ning time that drives the physical custody label, not the other\nway around.\n   We therefore agree with the parties and the Court of Appeals\nthat regardless of the label used in the decree and parenting\nplan to describe physical custody, the trial court here effec-\ntively imposed a joint physical custody arrangement by creat-\ning a week-on-week-off parenting time schedule.34 For the sake\nof clarity, we modify the language of the decree and parenting\nplan to reflect this holding.\n   We turn next to the question whether, by effectively impos-\ning a joint physical custody arrangement, the trial court abused\nits discretion. The Court of Appeals concluded it did, citing our\n\n31\n     Becher v.

Trimble v. Trimble\n   One of the first times this court addressed the concept of\njoint physical custody was in Trimble v. Trimble,36 decided in\n1984. In that case, the trial court awarded physical custody of\ntwo young children to the mother, finding she had \u201cspent a\ngreat deal more of her time with the children, has the more pre-\ndictable work and leisure schedule, and was more concerned\nwith the children\u2019s education.\u201d37 On appeal, the father argued it\nwas error not to award joint physical custody.\n   Trimble noted that \u201cin a given case joint custody might very\nwell act to preserve the parent-child bond for both parents and\nthus avoid the severance of either of the attachments.\u201d38 But\nwithout citation or further explanation, Trimble opined:\n      We believe, however, that such arrangements must be\n      reserved for the most rare of cases, i.e., where in the judg-\n      ment of the trial court the parents are of such maturity\n      that the arrangement will not operate to allow the child\n      to manipulate the parents or confuse the child\u2019s sense\n      of direction. A collateral question exists as to why those\n      most ideal of parents, who would satisfactorily cope with\n      the conflicts inherent in a joint child custody arrange-\n      ment, came to be divorced in the first instance. . . . We\n      are not prepared to reject the concept of joint custody, but\n      are not prepared to state that it should be a regular tool in\n      the remedies of the district courts.39\n\n35\n     See, e.g., Erin W., supra note 2; Zahl, supra note 3; Trimble, supra note 3;\n     Aguilar, supra note 3.\n36\n     Trimble, supra note 3.\n37\n     Id. at 119, 352 N.W.2d at 600.\n38\n     Id. at 119, 352 N.W.2d at 600-01.\n39\n     Id. at 120, 352 N.W.2d at 601.\n\f                                      - 950 -\n               Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                       303 Nebraska R eports\n                STATE ON BEHALF OF KAADEN S. v.

Zahl,41 we\ndescribed the rule this way:\n      [J]oint physical custody must be reserved for those cases\n      where, in the judgment of the trial court, the parents are\n      of such maturity that the arrangement will not operate to\n      allow the child to manipulate the parents or confuse the\n      child\u2019s sense of direction, and will provide a stable atmos\u00ad\n      phere for the child to adjust, rather than perpetuating tur-\n      moil or custodial wars.\nTrimble and Zahl use different phrasing but stand for the\nsame blanket proposition\u2014that joint custody arrangements are\ngenerally disfavored and should be reserved for rare or spe-\ncial cases.\n\n                     4. R evisiting Trimble\n   [7] Recently, in Leners v. Leners,42 we cited the rule dis-\nfavoring joint custody but cautioned that it should not be\nviewed as a \u201chard-and-fast rule.\u201d We emphasized that the\nParenting Act authorizes a trial court to award joint custody\n\n40\n     See, e.g., Ensrud v. Ensrud, 230 Neb. 720, 727, 433 N.W.2d 192, 197\n     (1988) (\u201c[t]his court has frequently and consistently expressed disapproval\n     of joint custody as a purported solution for the difficulty confronted by\n     a court in determining a question concerning child custody\u201d); Wilson v.\n     Wilson, 224 Neb. 589, 590, 399 N.W.2d 802, 803 (1987) (\u201c[w]e have . . .\n     stated explicitly that joint custody is not favored and must be reserved for\n     only the rarest of cases\u201d); Korf v.

In doing\nso, we analyzed the parents\u2019 relationship as one of many fac-\ntors bearing on the child\u2019s best interests. We noted that both\nparents were fit and that the child had a good relationship with\neach. We ultimately concluded that by establishing a parent-\ning plan that afforded roughly equal parenting time, the trial\ncourt had fashioned a schedule that maximized the child\u2019s time\nwith both parents, accommodated the father\u2019s unusual work\nschedule, and minimized the number of transitions and the\nneed for communication and coordination between the parents.\nWe found this plan served the child\u2019s best interests. Leners did\nnot expressly disapprove of the Trimble rule,44 but our analysis\nhighlighted tension between the best interests analysis required\nunder the Parenting Act and a blanket rule that disfavors joint\ncustody and reserves it only for rare cases.\n   We are persuaded the time has come to expressly reexam-\nine the proposition that joint custody arrangements are disfa-\nvored and \u201creserved\u201d for rare or special cases.45 The Wyoming\nSupreme Court recently engaged in a similar reevaluation of its\njudicial rule disfavoring joint custody.\n   In Bruegman v.

Joint Custody No Longer Disfavored\n    [8] The doctrine of stare decisis requires that we adhere to\nour previous decisions unless the reasons therefor have ceased\nto exist, are clearly erroneous, or are manifestly wrong and\nmischievous or unless more harm than good will result from\ndoing so.54 The doctrine is entitled to great weight, but it does\nnot require us to blindly perpetuate a prior interpretation of the\nlaw if we conclude it was clearly incorrect.55\n    We can conceive of no principled justification for continu-\ning to apply a blanket rule that disfavors joint legal or physi-\ncal custody, especially when the rule is based on generalized\nconcerns regarding parental maturity and possible behavioral\nconsequences to a child from spending substantial amounts of\ntime with each parent. Such concerns may well be valid in any\ngiven case and in that event should be considered in light of\nall the other factors and circumstances in arriving at a custody\nand parenting time arrangement that serves the best interests\nof the child at issue. But a blanket rule disfavoring joint legal\nor physical custody is difficult to reconcile with the Parenting\nAct, under which the best interests of the child are the polestar\nof all child custody and parenting time determinations.56\n    We see nothing in the Parenting Act that either favors or\ndisfavors any particular custody or parenting time arrange-\nment. The Parenting Act simply requires that all custody and\nparenting time arrangements be determined based on the best\ninterests of the child.57 The Parenting Act \u201cpresumes the criti-\ncal importance of the parent-child relationship in the welfare\nand development of the child and that the relationship between\nthe child and each parent should be equally considered unless\nit is contrary to the best interests of the child.\u201d58 The Parenting\n\n54\n     Davis v.

All cases governed by the Parenting Act 63\nrequire a judicial determination, whether expressly stated or\nnot, that the custody and parenting time arrangement ordered\nby the court is in the child\u2019s best interests.64 And a hearing on\nthe record is routinely held to facilitate that judicial determina-\ntion, whether the parents are submitting an agreed-upon parent-\ning plan for approval65 or have contested the issues of custody\nand parenting time such that a trial is necessary.\n   [9] We conclude that a blanket rule disfavoring joint cus-\ntody is inconsistent with the Parenting Act and unnecessarily\n\n59\n     See \u00a7 43-2923(3).\n60\n     See \u00a7 43-2923(4).\n61\n     \u00a7\u00a7 43-2923(6) and 43-2935(1).\n62\n     See, also, State ex rel.

We discuss those factors next.\n             6. Equal Parenting Time Was Not\n                     A buse of Discretion\n   We turn now to the primary question on further review:\nwhether the district court abused its discretion in creating\na parenting plan that gave Mandy and Jeffery nearly equal\nparenting time, effectively imposing a joint physical custody\narrangement. We address that question in light of the evidence\nadduced regarding Kaaden\u2019s best interests and disregarding\nour prior case law to the extent it disfavored joint physi-\ncal custody.\n                        (a) Best Interests\n   [11] When determining the best interests of the child in\ndeciding custody, a court must consider, at a minimum, (1)\nthe relationship of the minor child to each parent prior to\nthe commencement of the action; (2) the desires and wishes\nof a sufficiently mature child, if based on sound reasoning;\n(3) the general health, welfare, and social behavior of the\nchild; (4) credible evidence of abuse inflicted on any fam-\nily or household member; and (5) credible evidence of child\nabuse or neglect or domestic intimate partner abuse.70 In this\ncase, the trial court analyzed the evidence in light of each of\nthese factors.\n   [12] The Parenting Act also provides that the best inter-\nests of a child require a parenting plan that provides for a\nchild\u2019s safety, emotional growth, health, stability, physical care,\nand regular school attendance71 and which promotes a child\u2019s\n\n70\n     \u00a7 43-2923(6).

No single\n factor is determinative, and different factors may weigh more\n heavily in the court\u2019s analysis depending on the evidence pre-\n sented in each case.

This was the\nparenting time schedule recommended by Kaaden\u2019s counselor,\nand it is consistent with the court\u2019s express factual findings that\nboth parents are fit and provide a safe and appropriate home\nenvironment for Kaaden. Moreover, nearly equal parenting\ntime furthered the court\u2019s stated goal of allowing Kaaden to\n\u201cenjoy the full benefits of having both parents involved in his\nlife to the greatest degree possible.\u201d\n   In arguing that the award of nearly equal parenting time\nwas an abuse of discretion, Jeffery focuses almost exclusively\non evidence of Mandy\u2019s animosity toward him and their dif-\nficulty communicating. In our de novo review, we neither\nignore nor minimize evidence that the parties have difficulty\ncommunicating effectively regarding Kaaden\u2019s welfare, or\nthat Mandy has significant unresolved anger toward Jeffery\nand actively interfered with his parenting time while the case\nwas pending before the district court. But when all of the\nevidence is considered in light of Kaaden\u2019s best interests, we\ncannot find the parenting time awarded here was an abuse\nof discretion.\n   The trial court was appropriately concerned about Mandy\u2019s\ninterference with Jeffery\u2019s parenting time and her unresolved\nanger toward him, and it addressed those concerns by award-\ning Jeffery sole legal custody. This minimized the need for the\nparties to confer regularly because Jeffery has the sole author-\nity and responsibility to make fundamental decisions regarding\nKaaden\u2019s welfare, including choices regarding his education\nand health. The trial court also explained that placing primary\nlegal custody with Jeffery was the best way to ensure compli-\nance with the parenting plan.\n   And despite the tense relationship between Mandy and\nJeffery, the record fully supports the trial court\u2019s findings that\nboth Mandy and Jeffery are fit and proper parents who love\nKaaden and that both provide him safe and stable homes.\nThe evidence shows both parents have developed a nurturing,\n\f                                    - 959 -\n               Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                       303 Nebraska R eports\n               STATE ON BEHALF OF KAADEN S. v.

At the same time, the parenting schedule minimized\nthe need for direct interaction between the parents by limiting\nexchanges of Kaaden to one time per week at a neutral site.\n   An abuse of discretion occurs when a trial court bases its\ndecision on reasons that are untenable or unreasonable or if its\naction is clearly against justice or conscience, reason, and evi-\ndence.77 Here, the trial court made detailed and specific factual\nfindings which were fully supported by the record, and it pro-\nvided a carefully reasoned explanation for why it considered\nthe custody and parenting time arrangement to be in Kaaden\u2019s\nbest interests.\n   The trial court\u2019s goal was not to find a custody and parent-\ning time schedule the parents thought was fair, but to find one\nthat was actually in Kaaden\u2019s best interests. That required the\ncourt to create a parenting plan for a child who has a positive\nand nurturing relationship with both his parents, but whose\nparents do not have a good relationship with each other. On\nthis record, we find no abuse of discretion in developing a par-\nenting plan that gave Jeffery sole legal custody and effectively\nimposed a joint physical custody arrangement with a week-on-\nweek-off parenting time schedule.\n             7.

Nicolette G., 302 Neb. 465, 924 N.W.2d 48 (2019).\n78\n     \u00a7 4-215.\n\f                                    - 960 -\n               Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                       303 Nebraska R eports\n               STATE ON BEHALF OF KAADEN S. v. JEFFERY T.\n                           Cite as 303 Neb. 933\n\n   The district court also ordered Jeffery to pay the first $480\nof Kaaden\u2019s nonreimbursed reasonable and necessary health\ncare expenses per year, and it ordered Mandy to pay 50 per-\ncent of such expenses in excess of $480. We understand this\nlanguage to have effectively allocated responsibility for non-\nreimbursed health care expenses equally between Mandy and\nJeffery. No party contends otherwise, and no party challenges\nthe court\u2019s allocation of expenses in excess of $480. Instead,\nthe parties focus on whether the trial court erred in ordering\nJeffery to pay the first $480 of Kaaden\u2019s nonreimbursed health\ncare expenses. We limit our analysis accordingly.\n   Before the Court of Appeals, Jeffery argued it was error to\norder him to pay the first $480 of nonreimbursed health care\nexpenses. The Court of Appeals agreed, reasoning that the first\n$480 of nonreimbursed health care expenses was \u201csubsumed\nwithin the amount of child support that is ordered.\u201d79 The\nCourt of Appeals thus reversed that portion of the decree. On\nfurther review, Mandy argues the Court of Appeals improperly\nreversed on this issue. We conclude the Court of Appeals cor-\nrectly interpreted the child support guidelines.\n   [15] Nonreimbursed health care expenses are governed by\n\u00a7 4-215(B) of the child support guidelines, which states, in\npart, \u201cChildren\u2019s health care expenses are specifically included\nin the guidelines amount of up to $480 per child per year.\u201d As\nwe have explained, \u201cthe guidelines estimate $480 as an ordi-\nnary amount of such nonreimbursed medical expenses, and that\nfigure is then subsumed within the amount of child support that\nis ordered. Any nonreimbursed expenses exceeding $480 are\n[then] prorated between the parties.\u201d80\n   The guidelines do not require the trial court to expressly\nidentify any party as being responsible for the first $480 of\nnonreimbursed health care expenses, but they do require a\n\n79\n     State on behalf of Kaaden S., supra note 1, 26 Neb. App. at 434, 920\n     N.W.2d at 50.\n80\n     State on behalf of Martinez, supra note 12, 281 Neb. at 552, 797 N.W.2d\n     at 222.\n\f                                     - 961 -\n               Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                       303 Nebraska R eports\n                STATE ON BEHALF OF KAADEN S. v. JEFFERY T.\n                            Cite as 303 Neb. 933\n\ncourt to allocate nonreimbursed health care expenses in excess\nof $480 per year \u201cto the obligor parent as determined by the\ncourt.\u201d81 Such allocation \u201cshall not exceed the proportion of\nthe obligor\u2019s parental contribution (worksheet 1, line 6).\u201d82 The\nguidelines\u2019 reference to an \u201cobligor\u201d refers to the party ordered\nto pay child support.\n   We therefore agree with the Court of Appeals that under the\nchild support guidelines, the trial court erred in making Jeffery,\nwho is the obligor under its child support calculation, responsi-\nble for paying the first $480 of Kaaden\u2019s nonreimbursed health\ncare expenses, when such amounts are already subsumed in the\nmonthly child support payment. The trial court may have had\na sound reason for wanting Jeffery to pay such costs, but no\nexplanation was provided in the decree, so we have no basis\nupon which to review a deviation from the guidelines.83 We\naffirm the Court of Appeals\u2019 reversal of that portion of the\ndecree requiring Jeffery to pay the first $480 of Kaaden\u2019s non-\nreimbursed health care costs.\n                      8. Child Support\n   Because the Court of Appeals found the parenting time\nschedule was an abuse of discretion and remanded the matter\nto reduce Mandy\u2019s parenting time, it also concluded the trial\ncourt erred in using worksheet 3, the joint custody worksheet,\nto calculate child support. It thus reversed the child support\naward and remanded the matter for recalculation \u201cusing the\nappropriate worksheet.\u201d84\n   Mandy assigns this as error. She argues the trial court\u2019s use\nof worksheet 3 to calculate support was appropriate given the\n\n81\n     \u00a7 4-215(B).\n82\n     Id.\n83\n     See, generally, Neb. Ct. R. \u00a7 4-203 (rev. 2011) (child support guidelines\n     shall be applied as rebuttable presumption, and deviations should be\n     supported by specific findings).\n84\n     State on behalf of Kaaden S., supra note 1, 26 Neb. App. at 433, 920\n     N.W.2d at 50.\n\f                                   - 962 -\n               Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                       303 Nebraska R eports\n               STATE ON BEHALF OF KAADEN S. v. JEFFERY T.\n                           Cite as 303 Neb. 933\n\namount of parenting time she was awarded,85 and she seeks\naffirmance of the child support as ordered by the district court.\nNo party challenges any other aspect of the child support\naward, so we confine our analysis to whether it was error to\nuse worksheet 3.\n   [16] Child support payments should generally be set accord-\ning to the child support guidelines.86 Section 4-212 of the\nguidelines explains when, and how, worksheet 3 is to be\nutilized:\n         When a specific provision for joint physical custody is\n      ordered and each party\u2019s parenting time exceeds 142 days\n      per year, it is a rebuttable presumption that support shall\n      be calculated using worksheet 3. When a specific provi-\n      sion for joint physical custody is ordered and one party\u2019s\n      parenting time is 109 to 142 days per year, the use of\n      worksheet 3 to calculate support is at the discretion of the\n      court. . . . For purposes of these guidelines, a \u201cday\u201d shall\n      be generally defined as including an overnight period.\n   Here, the award of nearly equal parenting time effectively\ncreated a joint physical custody arrangement, and we have\nmodified the decree and parenting plan to so describe it.\nMoreover, under the parenting plan, Mandy\u2019s parenting time\nfar exceeds the rebuttable presumption of 142 overnights per\nyear referenced in \u00a7 4-212, and Jeffery has presented no evi-\ndence or argument that would rebut the presumptive use of\nworksheet 3. As such, we find no abuse of discretion in the\ntrial court\u2019s decision to use worksheet 3 to calculate child sup-\nport. We reverse the Court of Appeals\u2019 holding to the contrary,\nand remand the matter with directions to affirm the district\ncourt\u2019s child support award.\n                     V. CONCLUSION\n  For the foregoing reasons, we modify the language of the\ndecree and the parenting plan to reflect an award of joint\n\n85\n     See Neb. Ct.
