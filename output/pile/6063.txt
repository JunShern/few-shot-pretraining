    "text": "Sean Brodrick: So far, January has been a bullish month for commodities. In fact, if you read my December 29 column, \u201c3 Commodities to Buy for 2012,\u201d you saw that I recommended three commodity funds in that column \u2014 the United States Gasoline Fund (NYSE:UGA), the Rogers International Commodity Index Agriculture Total Return ETN (NYSE:RJA) and the Teucrium Corn Fund (NYSE:CORN).\n\nSince then all three are up, and one of them \u2014 UGA \u2014 is up nicely.\n\nUGA opened December 29 at $48.24. This Tuesday, it sported a price of $50.62 \u2014 a 5% gain in just seven trading days.\n\nHave you ever wondered how billionaires continue to get RICHER, while the rest of the world is struggling?\n\n\"I study billionaires for a living. To be more specific, I study how these investors generate such huge and consistent profits in the stock markets -- year-in and year-out.\"\n\nThe other two only have small gains, but I still think all three are good bets for 2012. Today, I\u2019ll give you another bullish commodity bet \u2014 right after I tell you about three forces that are lining up to push commodity prices higher.\n\nYou can see that Alcoa expects worldwide, commercial building and construction demand for aluminum to rise 4% to 5% this year; car manufacturers will use an additional 3% to 8% aluminum; and global aerospace demand for aluminum should rise 10% to 11% this year.\n\nMy take is that this is pretty bullish for the global economy.\n\n2) Bad News from China Is Seen as Good News. This week, China reported a 13.4% increase in exports and an 11.8% jump in imports in December. That may sound good, but the import growth was a little more than HALF the growth rate registered in November.\n\nBut markets are taking this as good news. In fact, China\u2019s stock market surged 2.7% on the idea.\n\nThat\u2019s because investors believe this slower growth will prompt China to announce new measures to ease its monetary policy sooner rather than later. Investors also liked reports that the government will endorse policies aimed at spurring investments in the Chinese stock market.\n\nThe bottom line is that, when the market rises on bad news, it\u2019s pretty darned bullish.\n\n3) Bullish Parade of News for Oil. Along with an improved outlook for the global economy, crude oil (NYSE:USO) is getting a boost from worsening tensions between the West and Iran, as well as a national strike that could affect oil production in Nigeria.\n\nA 6% annual rise in oil imports by China is another bullish factor for crude. China has recently much-reduced its imports from Iran due to disputes over payment. That means China will need to source its demand elsewhere, which could drive prices further upward.\n\nTo be sure, all of these problems could be resolved. But tensions with Iran could also get worse, and other problems could flare up. While it\u2019s said that the cure for high oil prices is high oil prices, I still believe crude could be making a run to my target of $119 per barrel.\n\nBullish but Cautious\n\nThere is still plenty that could go wrong with commodity prices. If investors start to panic about the euro again, they\u2019ll pile into the U.S. dollar. Since commodities are priced in dollars, that tends to drive commodity prices lower.\n\nAlso, Europe is probably still going to slide into recession this year. That would weigh on global demand.\n\nSo while I\u2019m bullish, I\u2019m cautious. I\u2019m limiting position sizes and setting protective stops to (hopefully) save my butt in case the market heads south in a hurry.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s another trade you can add today to our basket of commodity plays \u2014 and this one shines in a sea of precious metals names.\n\nOne More Way to Play Bullish Commodity Prices\n\nAlong with the other three picks I gave you on December 29, here is another commodity pick that should do well in 2012 \u2026\n\nLooking at the chart, you can see it sure looks like silver hammered out an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern and is now testing the neckline of that pattern.\n\nSLV could easily head up to its December high and, once bullish momentum gets rolling, we may even see the October high again.\n\nWho\u2019s Right, Who\u2019s Wrong?\n\nBy now, you know that I and other analysts at Weiss Research don\u2019t always agree on everything. Maybe the more-bearish view will be proven correct. But I have to go with what my signals are telling me. They\u2019re turning more bullish, and they\u2019re too loud to ignore.\n\nIf you\u2019d care to talk with me about it in person \u2014 good news. I\u2019ll be speaking at the Cambridge House 2012 Resource Investment Conference in Vancouver, January 22-23. You can find more information about that here. It\u2019s a conference that\u2019s packed with great speakers and more than 600 companies are presenting and exhibiting.\n\nIf you\u2019re trading on your own, do your own due diligence and make up your own mind before investing a single cent. And good luck to us all in this market.\n\nMoney and Markets (MaM) is published by Weiss Research, Inc. and written by Martin D.
