Both carriers have made a huge investment in LTE, and they can't leverage that investment by selling non-LTE iPhone 4 and 4S models to customers. Back in the day when they were the only popular smartphone in town, Apple could tell the carriers to go fark themselves, but when you have Android phones dominating the market and models like the Galaxy S3 rivaling the iPhone 5 for popularity, Apple suddenly has to play ball with the carriers again and give them the LTE phones that they want.\n\nStoPPeRmobile:Mad_Radhu: Back in the day when they were the only popular smartphone in town\n\nWhen was that?\n\n2007 to 2009. Before Verizon launched the Droid, there really weren't any smartphones outside of Blackberry/Sidekick that really got the public excited the way the iPhone did. Prior to the iPhone, it was pretty rare for non-business customers to pony up for a premium smartphone, plus a data and texting plan. The iPhone basically moved a big chunk of the non-techie public from cheap Razrs that were just used for phone calls into more profitable plans for the carriers, which is why AT&T wanted it so badly and Verizon, T-Mobile, and Sprint were all trying to come up with iPhone killers. You could probably even argue that it wasn't really until the release of the Galaxy S phones in mid-2010 that the iPhone really had credible competition, so AT&T and Apple pretty much had that lucrative market of new smartphone users to themselves until then."
