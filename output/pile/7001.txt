    "text": "Q:\n\nWhere to store error/info messages for the user in PHP?\n\nI was wondering, what's the best way to store messages for the user in PHP. With messages i mean something like\n\nAuthentication successful\n\nor\n\nPlease enter a valid e-mail address\n\nCurrently I'm working on a project where they are stored in the $_SESSION variable, but I don't think this is a good solution. \nShort explanation how I do it at the moment (The class Message was created by me)\n$_SESSION[\"msg\"][] = new Message(\"...\");\n\nand \nforeach ( $_SESSION [\"msg\"] as $msg ) :\n    echo $msg->getText();\nendforeach;\n\nunset ( $_SESSION [\"msg\"] );\n\nThis is just a simplified version of the complete code, but you should get the idea.\nEDIT: Forgot to say, that I'm working with an MVC framework and want to speperate the logic from the output.\n\nA:\n\nOne can only speculate on the nature/contents of your Message Class. However, here; attempt was made to simulate a mock-up of a class called Message; also the Usage in your View Script was shown below the Class. Be sure that $_SESSION is active on both Scripts.... Perhaps, this may shed some new light on how to go about your unique case:\n    <?php\n\n        //FIRST CHECK IF SESSION EXIST BEFORE STARTING IT:\n        if (session_status() == PHP_SESSION_NONE  || session_id() == '') {\n            session_start();\n        }\n\n        class Message {\n\n            protected $msg;\n\n            public function __construct() {\n                if(!isset($_SESSION['msg'])){\n                    $_SESSION['msg']    = array();\n                }\n            }\n\n            public function setText($message){\n                if(!in_array($message, $_SESSION['msg'])){\n                    $_SESSION['msg'][]  = $message;\n                }\n            }\n\n            public function getText(){\n                return \"Some Logic for getting Message\";\n            }\n        }\n        ?>\n\n        <?php\n            // INSIDE OF YOUR VIEW SCRIPT; AT THE VERY TOP, ENABLE SESSION AS WELL:\n\n            //FIRST CHECK IF SESSION EXIST BEFORE STARTING IT:\n            if (session_status() == PHP_SESSION_NONE  || session_id() == '') {\n                session_start();\n            }\n\n            // THEN LOOP THROUGH THE SESSION DATA FOR MESSAGES TO BE DISPLAYED\n            $msg    = new Message();\n            if(isset($_SESSION['msg'])) {\n                foreach ($_SESSION [\"msg\"] as $msg) :\n                    echo $msg->getText();\n                endforeach;\n\n                unset ($_SESSION [\"msg\"]);\n            }\n\n"
