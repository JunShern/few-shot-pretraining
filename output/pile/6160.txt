I was actually hoping that the Sox would make a move for DeRosa. He hits from the rightside (as we all know the Sox need a right-handed hitting bench/platoon guy), plays passable defense, hits for some power, can play the corner outfield spots and can backup Crede/Iguchi at 3B/2B. Only problem is Mack or Gload would have needed to be moved for that to have happened.\n\nI disagree with you guys, this is a good signing for the Cubs and would have been for any other MLB team, as long as he isn't relied on too heavily.\n\nCLR01\n\n11-14-2006, 04:40 PM\n\nWhy is this a bad signing??

Oh well, there's one Cub I like. It's way too high of a price, but DeRosa is a very good hitter and for a replacement RF he really played it well last year in Arlington. His numbers were insane at parts of the year last year, and with the great pitching in the NL Central, they should get even higher.\n\nDaleJRFan\n\n11-14-2006, 04:42 PM\n\nI don't think it's a bad signing, but I wouldn't call it a very good signing.

He has done very well every year prior to 2005 in a platoon role... I agree the Flubs overpaid, but they probably did so to lock him up now and now have to outbid any other team.\n\nThe Cubs picked up a good player for their every day 2B opening, but I agree - they did over pay.\n\nDaleJRFan\n\n11-14-2006, 04:43 PM\n\nPaying 4+ million for a guy who can't be \"relied on too heavily\" is a good move?\n\nThat's what Derrek Lee and Aramis Ramirez are for, in their lineup. I should have been more specific with that comment. I meant, if they expect him to bat 300/30/100 in the 3-hole, they are sadly mistaken.\n\nthedudeabides\n\n11-14-2006, 04:51 PM\n\nHe played everyday last year and did very well.

He's 31 and has had one season with over 500 at bats and only one more with over 300 at bats ( a.239 average). I just think it's a reach. A decent player, but they overpaid. Either way it's not going to make or break them.\n\nSox Fan 35\n\n11-14-2006, 04:55 PM\n\nI like DeRosa but 4 million a year is too much.\n\nFoulke You\n\n11-14-2006, 05:10 PM\n\nI have to echo the sentiments of others here. DeRosa is a nice little player but they threw too much money at him. Hendry is in a free spending mood and is setting the bar very high for free agents this offseason.:mad:\n\nStillMissOzzie\n\n11-14-2006, 05:14 PM\n\nThe 2006 Cubs are in a similar position to the 2003 Tigers, in that they HAVE to overpay to attract FAs to their last place hovel.\n\nSMO\n:gulp:\n\nHitmen77\n\n11-14-2006, 05:36 PM\n\nhow is he defensively?\n\nDick Allen\n\n11-14-2006, 06:27 PM\n\nWell, I'm sure the local media will be hailing him as the new savior for the Flubs. Oh wait, that's for Soriano, Jason Schmidt, and all the others who will most certainly sign with the Flubs.\n\nJB98\n\n11-14-2006, 07:24 PM\n\nThe Cubs were in better shape at 2B last year with Todd Walker. DeRosa is best in a utility role. They threw a bunch of money at him to be the everyday second baseman. LOL.\n\nchampagne030\n\n11-14-2006, 07:26 PM\n\nhow is he defensively?\n\nMediocre at best at any position. His value is that he plays so many positions and kills LH pitching.\n\nmunchman33\n\n11-14-2006, 07:26 PM\n\nIt's amazing that they're throwing out money like this when they still need four starters.\n\nmjmcend\n\n11-14-2006, 07:34 PM\n\nThis is the problem with the Cubs and Hendry. He throws money at mediocre players while simultaneously crying poor and missing on the top free agents.\n\nWould you rather have Furcal and Soriano, or DeRosa, Neifi, Izturis, Eyre, and Dempster?\n\nJB98\n\n11-14-2006, 07:34 PM\n\nIt's amazing that they're throwing out money like this when they still need four starters.\n\nYou have to remember the average Cubs fan is not as astute as you or I. If they throw a bunch of money at several position players, they'll be able to hype the team as \"much-improved,\" causing the sheep to charge through the turnstiles with glee again next season. Eventually, though, the reality of their poor starting rotation will set in, and they'll lose 90 games again.\n\nThat's a terrible rotation, but the business model is more important than winning on the North Side.\n\nJB98\n\n11-14-2006, 07:35 PM\n\nThis is the problem with the Cubs and Hendry.

I felt like the Cubs had five home games.''\n\n:rolleyes: uh, yeah...Did he tell the Tribune this before or after they gave him $13 million? I heard last year's free agent signings (Jones and Pierre) have really enjoyed the Wrigley atmosphere. I bet DeRosa can hardly wait to see the fans throwing trash on the field.\n\nCLR01\n\n11-14-2006, 10:44 PM\n\nThe Cubune spin on this signing is in full swing:\n\"I remember everything like it was yesterday,'' he said. \"I saw for myself in '03 that that place is electric \u2026\n\nThat's the 100 year old electrical work and the piss coated concrete.
