Note the comment above:\n\nThe default url to be used after updating a resource. You need to overwrite this method in your own RegistrationsController.\n\nIf for some reason this doesn't work in rails 3, you could try to do something like this:\ndef after_update_path_for(resource)\n  if params[:action] == 'my_action' && params[:controller] == 'my_controller'\n    render :page\n  else\n    render :root_path\n  end\nend\n\n"
