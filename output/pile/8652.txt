Each client should have its own API key to connect with.\nNow I have read different things but I still have some questions.\nI have found this one: http://bitoftech.net/2014/06/01/token-based-authentication-asp-net-web-api-2-owin-asp-net-identity/#comments but is it sufficient?\nSo basically:\n\nclient connects with given username/password\nclient gets a bearer token back\nclient uses this token in each post to the api until the timestamp is over\n\nI also have read about giving a API Secret key to each client which he can uses: http://bitoftech.net/2014/12/15/secure-asp-net-web-api-using-api-key-authentication-hmac-authentication/\nWhat is the best approach?\n\nA:\n\nYou are on the right track by using Token based authentication. Here is a link which shows the implementation details-\nToken based authentication in Web API without any user interface\nAdditionally, I think you can secure the channel using SSL-\nhttp://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/55d2ea/creating-and-using-C-Sharp-web-application-over-https-ssl/\n\n"
