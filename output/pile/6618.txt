Because the fundamental matrix is rank-deficient, it is only defined up to a scale factor. If you define everything in terms of pixel units, there is no way to reconstruct the scene in real-world units.\nSolving this requires an additional piece of information: the relationship between a pair of corresponding points in a three-dimensional coordinate frame. For a stereo system, this is most often the baseline, the distance between the left and right camera centers.\n\n"
