ALABAMA\n\n     CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEALS OF \n\n                        ALABAMA\n\n\n    No. 10\u20139646. Argued March 20, 2012\u2014Decided June 25, 2012*\n\nIn each of these cases, a 14-year-old was convicted of murder and sen-\n  tenced to a mandatory term of life imprisonment without the possibil-\n  ity of parole. In No. 10\u22129647, petitioner Jackson accompanied two\n  other boys to a video store to commit a robbery; on the way to the\n  store, he learned that one of the boys was carrying a shotgun. Jack-\n  son stayed outside the store for most of the robbery, but after he en-\n  tered, one of his co-conspirators shot and killed the store clerk. Ar-\n  kansas charged Jackson as an adult with capital felony murder and\n  aggravated robbery, and a jury convicted him of both crimes. The\n  trial court imposed a statutorily mandated sentence of life imprison-\n  ment without the possibility of parole. Jackson filed a state habeas\n  petition, arguing that a mandatory life-without-parole term for a 14-\n  year-old violates the Eighth Amendment. Disagreeing, the court\n  granted the State\u2019s motion to dismiss. The Arkansas Supreme Court\n  affirmed.\n     In No. 10\u22129646, petitioner Miller, along with a friend, beat Miller\u2019s\n  neighbor and set fire to his trailer after an evening of drinking and\n  drug use. The neighbor died. Miller was initially charged as a juve-\n  nile, but his case was removed to adult court, where he was charged\n  with murder in the course of arson. A jury found Miller guilty, and\n  the trial court imposed a statutorily mandated punishment of life\n  without parole. The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed,\n  holding that Miller\u2019s sentence was not overly harsh when compared\n  to his crime, and that its mandatory nature was permissible under\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * Together with No. 10\u20139647, Jackson v. Hobbs, Director, Arkansas\nDepartment of Correction, on certiorari to the Supreme Court of Arkan-\nsas.\n\f2                        MILLER v. ALABAMA\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n    the Eighth Amendment.\nHeld: The Eighth Amendment forbids a sentencing scheme that man-\n dates life in prison without possibility of parole for juvenile homicide\n offenders. Pp. 6\u221227.\n    (a) The Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition of cruel and unusual pun-\n ishment \u201cguarantees individuals the right not to be subjected to ex-\n cessive sanctions.\u201d Roper v. Simmons, 543 U. S. 551, 560. That right\n \u201cflows from the basic \u2018precept of justice that punishment for crime\n should be graduated and proportioned\u2019 \u201d to both the offender and the\n offense. Ibid.\n    Two strands of precedent reflecting the concern with proportionate\n punishment come together here. The first has adopted categorical\n bans on sentencing practices based on mismatches between the cul-\n pability of a class of offenders and the severity of a penalty. See, e.g.,\n Kennedy v. Louisiana, 554 U. S. 407. Several cases in this group\n have specially focused on juvenile offenders, because of their lesser\n culpability. Thus, Roper v. Simmons held that the Eighth Amend-\n ment bars capital punishment for children, and Graham v. Florida,\n 560 U. S. ___, concluded that the Amendment prohibits a sentence of\n life without the possibility of parole for a juvenile convicted of a non-\n homicide offense. Graham further likened life without parole for ju-\n veniles to the death penalty, thereby evoking a second line of cases.\n In those decisions, this Court has required sentencing authorities to\n consider the characteristics of a defendant and the details of his of-\n fense before sentencing him to death. See, e.g., Woodson v. North\n Carolina, 428 U. S. 280 (plurality opinion). Here, the confluence of\n these two lines of precedent leads to the conclusion that mandatory\n life without parole for juveniles violates the Eighth Amendment.\n    As to the first set of cases: Roper and Graham establish that chil-\n dren are constitutionally different from adults for sentencing purpos-\n es. Their \u201c \u2018lack of maturity\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018underdeveloped sense of respon-\n sibility\u2019 \u201d lead to recklessness, impulsivity, and heedless risk-taking.\n Roper, 543 U. S., at 569. They \u201care more vulnerable . . . to negative\n influences and outside pressures,\u201d including from their family and\n peers; they have limited \u201ccontro[l] over their own environment\u201d and\n lack the ability to extricate themselves from horrific, crime-producing\n settings. Ibid. And because a child\u2019s character is not as \u201cwell\n formed\u201d as an adult\u2019s, his traits are \u201cless fixed\u201d and his actions are\n less likely to be \u201cevidence of irretrievabl[e] deprav[ity].\u201d Id., at 570.\n Roper and Graham emphasized that the distinctive attributes of\n youth diminish the penological justifications for imposing the harsh-\n est sentences on juvenile offenders, even when they commit terrible\n crimes.\n    While Graham\u2019s flat ban on life without parole was for nonhomi-\n\f                   Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                    3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\ncide crimes, nothing that Graham said about children is crime-\nspecific. Thus, its reasoning implicates any life-without-parole sen-\ntence for a juvenile, even as its categorical bar relates only to non-\nhomicide offenses. Most fundamentally, Graham insists that youth\nmatters in determining the appropriateness of a lifetime of incarcera-\ntion without the possibility of parole. The mandatory penalty\nschemes at issue here, however, prevent the sentencer from consider-\ning youth and from assessing whether the law\u2019s harshest term of im-\nprisonment proportionately punishes a juvenile offender. This con-\ntravenes Graham\u2019s (and also Roper\u2019s) foundational principle: that\nimposition of a State\u2019s most severe penalties on juvenile offenders\ncannot proceed as though they were not children.\n   Graham also likened life-without-parole sentences for juveniles to\nthe death penalty. That decision recognized that life-without-parole\nsentences \u201cshare some characteristics with death sentences that are\nshared by no other sentences.\u201d 560 U. S., at ___. And it treated life\nwithout parole for juveniles like this Court\u2019s cases treat the death\npenalty, imposing a categorical bar on its imposition for nonhomicide\noffenses. By likening life-without-parole sentences for juveniles to\nthe death penalty, Graham makes relevant this Court\u2019s cases de-\nmanding individualized sentencing in capital cases. In particular,\nthose cases have emphasized that sentencers must be able to consid-\ner the mitigating qualities of youth. In light of Graham\u2019s reasoning,\nthese decisions also show the flaws of imposing mandatory life-\nwithout-parole sentences on juvenile homicide offenders. Pp. 6\u221217.\n   (b) The counterarguments of Alabama and Arkansas are unpersua-\nsive. Pp. 18\u201327.\n        (1) The States first contend that Harmelin v. Michigan, 501\nU. S. 957, forecloses a holding that mandatory life-without-parole\nsentences for juveniles violate the Eighth Amendment. Harmelin de-\nclined to extend the individualized sentencing requirement to non-\ncapital cases \u201cbecause of the qualitative difference between death and\nall other penalties.\u201d Id., at 1006 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and\nconcurring in judgment). But Harmelin had nothing to do with chil-\ndren, and did not purport to apply to juvenile offenders. Indeed,\nsince Harmelin, this Court has held on multiple occasions that sen-\ntencing practices that are permissible for adults may not be so for\nchildren. See Roper, 543 U. S. 551; Graham, 560 U. S ___.\n   The States next contend that mandatory life-without-parole terms\nfor juveniles cannot be unconstitutional because 29 jurisdictions im-\npose them on at least some children convicted of murder. In consid-\nering categorical bars to the death penalty and life without parole,\nthis Court asks as part of the analysis whether legislative enact-\nments and actual sentencing practices show a national consensus\n\f4                          MILLER v. ALABAMA\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    against a sentence for a particular class of offenders. But where, as\n    here, this Court does not categorically bar a penalty, but instead re-\n    quires only that a sentencer follow a certain process, this Court has\n    not scrutinized or relied on legislative enactments in the same way.\n    See, e.g., Sumner v. Schuman, 483 U. S. 66.\n       In any event, the \u201cobjective indicia of society\u2019s standards,\u201d Graham,\n    560 U. S., at ___, that the States offer do not distinguish these cases\n    from others holding that a sentencing practice violates the Eighth\n    Amendment. Fewer States impose mandatory life-without-parole\n    sentences on juvenile homicide offenders than authorized the penalty\n    (life-without-parole for nonhomicide offenders) that this Court invali-\n    dated in Graham. And as Graham and Thompson v. Oklahoma, 487\n    U. S. 815, explain, simply counting legislative enactments can pre-\n    sent a distorted view. In those cases, as here, the relevant penalty\n    applied to juveniles based on two separate provisions: One allowed\n    the transfer of certain juvenile offenders to adult court, while another\n    set out penalties for any and all individuals tried there. In those cir-\n    cumstances, this Court reasoned, it was impossible to say whether a\n    legislature had endorsed a given penalty for children (or would do so\n    if presented with the choice). The same is true here. Pp. 18\u201325.\n           (2) The States next argue that courts and prosecutors suffi-\n    ciently consider a juvenile defendant\u2019s age, as well as his background\n    and the circumstances of his crime, when deciding whether to try him\n    as an adult. But this argument ignores that many States use manda-\n    tory transfer systems. In addition, some lodge the decision in the\n    hands of the prosecutors, rather than courts. And even where judges\n    have transfer-stage discretion, it has limited utility, because the deci-\n    sionmaker typically will have only partial information about the child\n    or the circumstances of his offense. Finally, because of the limited\n    sentencing options in some juvenile courts, the transfer decision may\n    present a choice between a light sentence as a juvenile and standard\n    sentencing as an adult. It cannot substitute for discretion at post-\n    trial sentencing. Pp. 25\u221227.\nNo. 10\u22129646, 63 So. 3d 676, and No. 10\u22129647, 2011 Ark. 49, ___ S.

In neither case did the sentenc-\ning authority have any discretion to impose a different\npunishment. State law mandated that each juvenile die\nin prison even if a judge or jury would have thought that\nhis youth and its attendant characteristics, along with the\nnature of his crime, made a lesser sentence (for example,\nlife with the possibility of parole) more appropriate. Such\na scheme prevents those meting out punishment from\nconsidering a juvenile\u2019s \u201clessened culpability\u201d and greater\n\u201ccapacity for change,\u201d Graham v. Florida, 560 U.

We therefore hold that\nmandatory life without parole for those under the age of\n18 at the time of their crimes violates the Eighth Amend-\nment\u2019s prohibition on \u201ccruel and unusual punishments.\u201d\n                               I\n                              A\n  In November 1999, petitioner Kuntrell Jackson, then 14\nyears old, and two other boys decided to rob a video store.\nEn route to the store, Jackson learned that one of the\nboys, Derrick Shields, was carrying a sawed-off shotgun in\nhis coat sleeve. Jackson decided to stay outside when the\ntwo other boys entered the store. Inside, Shields pointed\nthe gun at the store clerk, Laurie Troup, and demanded\nthat she \u201cgive up the money.\u201d Jackson v. State, 359 Ark.\n87, 89, 194 S. W. 3d 757, 759 (2004) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Troup refused. A few moments later,\nJackson went into the store to find Shields continuing to\ndemand money. At trial, the parties disputed whether\nJackson warned Troup that \u201c[w]e ain\u2019t playin\u2019,\u201d or instead\ntold his friends, \u201cI thought you all was playin\u2019.\u201d Id., at 91,\n194 S. W. 3d, at 760 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nWhen Troup threatened to call the police, Shields shot and\nkilled her. The three boys fled empty-handed. See id., at\n89\u201392, 194 S. W. 3d, at 758\u2013760.\n  Arkansas law gives prosecutors discretion to charge 14-\nyear-olds as adults when they are alleged to have commit-\nted certain serious offenses. See Ark. Code Ann. \u00a79\u201327\u2013\n318(c)(2) (1998). The prosecutor here exercised that au-\nthority by charging Jackson with capital felony murder\nand aggravated robbery. Jackson moved to transfer the\ncase to juvenile court, but after considering the alleged\nfacts of the crime, a psychiatrist\u2019s examination, and Jack-\nson\u2019s juvenile arrest history (shoplifting and several inci-\n\f                    Cite as: 567 U.

Noting that \u201cin view of [the] verdict, there\u2019s only\none possible punishment,\u201d the judge sentenced Jackson to\nlife without parole. App. in No. 10\u20139647, p. 55 (hereinaf-\nter Jackson App.); see Ark. Code Ann. \u00a75\u20134\u2013104(b) (1997)\n(\u201cA defendant convicted of capital murder or treason shall\nbe sentenced to death or life imprisonment without pa-\nrole\u201d).1 Jackson did not challenge the sentence on appeal,\nand the Arkansas Supreme Court affirmed the convic-\ntions. See 359 Ark. 87, 194 S. W. 3d 757.\n   Following Roper v. Simmons, 543 U. S. 551 (2005), in\nwhich this Court invalidated the death penalty for all\njuvenile offenders under the age of 18, Jackson filed a\nstate petition for habeas corpus. He argued, based on\nRoper\u2019s reasoning, that a mandatory sentence of life with-\nout parole for a 14-year-old also violates the Eighth\nAmendment. The circuit court rejected that argument and\ngranted the State\u2019s motion to dismiss. See Jackson App.\n72\u201376. While that ruling was on appeal, this Court held\nin Graham v. Florida that life without parole violates the\nEighth Amendment when imposed on juvenile nonhomi-\ncide offenders. After the parties filed briefs addressing\nthat decision, the Arkansas Supreme Court affirmed the\ndismissal of Jackson\u2019s petition. See Jackson v. Norris,\n2011 Ark. 49, ___ S. W. 3d ___.

Miller had by then been in and out\nof foster care because his mother suffered from alcoholism\nand drug addiction and his stepfather abused him. Miller,\ntoo, regularly used drugs and alcohol; and he had at-\ntempted suicide four times, the first when he was six years\nold. See E. J. M. v. State, 928 So. 2d 1077, 1081 (Ala.\nCrim. App. 2004) (Cobb, J., concurring in result); App. in\nNo. 10\u20139646, pp. 26\u201328 (hereinafter Miller App.).\n   One night in 2003, Miller was at home with a friend,\nColby Smith, when a neighbor, Cole Cannon, came to\nmake a drug deal with Miller\u2019s mother. See 6 Record in\nNo. 10\u20139646, p. 1004. The two boys followed Cannon back\nto his trailer, where all three smoked marijuana and\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 For the first time in this Court, Arkansas contends that Jackson\u2019s\n\nsentence was not mandatory. On its view, state law then in effect\nallowed the trial judge to suspend the life-without-parole sentence and\ncommit Jackson to the Department of Human Services for a \u201ctraining-\nschool program,\u201d at the end of which he could be placed on probation.\nBrief for Respondent in No. 10\u20139647, pp. 36\u201337 (hereinafter Arkansas\nBrief) (citing Ark. Code Ann. \u00a712\u201328\u2013403(b)(2) (1999)). But Arkansas\nnever raised that objection in the state courts, and they treated Jack-\nson\u2019s sentence as mandatory. We abide by that interpretation of state\nlaw. See, e.g., Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U. S. 684, 690\u2013691 (1975).\n\f                     Cite as: 567 U.

Miller\nthen tried to put the wallet back in Cannon\u2019s pocket, but\nCannon awoke and grabbed Miller by the throat. Smith\nhit Cannon with a nearby baseball bat, and once released,\nMiller grabbed the bat and repeatedly struck Cannon with\nit. Miller placed a sheet over Cannon\u2019s head, told him\n\u201c \u2018I am God, I\u2019ve come to take your life,\u2019 \u201d and delivered one\nmore blow. Miller v. State, 63 So. 3d 676, 689 (Ala. Crim.\nApp. 2010). The boys then retreated to Miller\u2019s trailer, but\nsoon decided to return to Cannon\u2019s to cover up evidence of\ntheir crime. Once there, they lit two fires. Cannon even-\ntually died from his injuries and smoke inhalation. See\nid., at 683\u2013685, 689.\n    Alabama law required that Miller initially be charged as\na juvenile, but allowed the District Attorney to seek re-\nmoval of the case to adult court. See Ala. Code \u00a712\u201315\u201334\n(1977). The D. A. did so, and the juvenile court agreed\nto the transfer after a hearing. Citing the nature of the\ncrime, Miller\u2019s \u201cmental maturity,\u201d and his prior juvenile\noffenses (truancy and \u201ccriminal mischief\u201d), the Alabama\nCourt of Criminal Appeals affirmed. E. J. M. v. State, No.\nCR\u201303\u20130915, pp. 5\u20137 (Aug. 27, 2004) (unpublished memo-\nrandum).3 The State accordingly charged Miller as an\nadult with murder in the course of arson. That crime (like\ncapital murder in Arkansas) carries a mandatory mini-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The  Court of Criminal Appeals also affirmed the juvenile court\u2019s\ndenial of Miller\u2019s request for funds to hire his own mental expert for the\ntransfer hearing. The court pointed out that under governing Alabama\nSupreme Court precedent, \u201cthe procedural requirements of a trial do\nnot ordinarily apply\u201d to those hearings. E. J. M. v. State, 928 So. 2d\n1077 (2004) (Cobb, J., concurring in result) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). In a separate opinion, Judge Cobb agreed on the reigning\nprecedent, but urged the State Supreme Court to revisit the question in\nlight of transfer hearings\u2019 importance. See id., at 1081 (\u201c[A]lthough\nlater mental evaluation as an adult affords some semblance of proce-\ndural due process, it is, in effect, too little, too late\u201d).\n\f6                   MILLER v. ALABAMA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmum punishment of life without parole. See Ala. Code\n\u00a7\u00a713A\u20135\u201340(9), 13A\u20136\u20132(c) (1982).\n  Relying in significant part on testimony from Smith,\nwho had pleaded to a lesser offense, a jury found Miller\nguilty. He was therefore sentenced to life without the\npossibility of parole. The Alabama Court of Criminal\nAppeals affirmed, ruling that life without parole was \u201cnot\noverly harsh when compared to the crime\u201d and that the\nmandatory nature of the sentencing scheme was permissi-\nble under the Eighth Amendment. 63 So. 3d, at 690; see\nid., at 686\u2013691. The Alabama Supreme Court denied\nreview.\n  We granted certiorari in both cases, see 565 U. S. ___\n(2011) (No. 10\u20139646); 565 U. S. ___ (2011) (No. 10\u20139647),\nand now reverse.\n                             II\n   The Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition of cruel and un-\nusual punishment \u201cguarantees individuals the right not to\nbe subjected to excessive sanctions.\u201d Roper, 543 U. S., at\n560. That right, we have explained, \u201cflows from the basic\n\u2018precept of justice that punishment for crime should be\ngraduated and proportioned\u2019 \u201d to both the offender and the\noffense. Ibid. (quoting Weems v. United States, 217 U. S.\n349, 367 (1910)). As we noted the last time we consid-\nered life-without-parole sentences imposed on juveniles,\n\u201c[t]he concept of proportionality is central to the Eighth\nAmendment.\u201d Graham, 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 8).\nAnd we view that concept less through a historical prism\nthan according to \u201c \u2018the evolving standards of decency\nthat mark the progress of a maturing society.\u2019 \u201d Estelle v.\nGamble, 429 U. S. 97, 102 (1976) (quoting Trop v. Dulles,\n356 U. S. 86, 101 (1958) (plurality opinion)).\n   The cases before us implicate two strands of precedent\nreflecting our concern with proportionate punishment.\nThe first has adopted categorical bans on sentencing\n\f                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                     7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\npractices based on mismatches between the culpability of\na class of offenders and the severity of a penalty. See\nGraham, 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9\u201310) (listing cases).\nSo, for example, we have held that imposing the death\npenalty for nonhomicide crimes against individuals, or\nimposing it on mentally retarded defendants, violates the\nEighth Amendment. See Kennedy v. Louisiana, 554 U. S.\n407 (2008); Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U. S. 304 (2002). Sev-\neral of the cases in this group have specially focused on\njuvenile offenders, because of their lesser culpability.\nThus, Roper held that the Eighth Amendment bars capital\npunishment for children, and Graham concluded that the\nAmendment also prohibits a sentence of life without the\npossibility of parole for a child who committed a nonhomi-\ncide offense. Graham further likened life without parole\nfor juveniles to the death penalty itself, thereby evoking\na second line of our precedents. In those cases, we have\nprohibited mandatory imposition of capital punishment,\nrequiring that sentencing authorities consider the charac-\nteristics of a defendant and the details of his offense before\nsentencing him to death. See Woodson v. North Carolina,\n428 U. S. 280 (1976) (plurality opinion); Lockett v. Ohio,\n438 U. S. 586 (1978). Here, the confluence of these two\nlines of precedent leads to the conclusion that mandatory\nlife-without-parole sentences for juveniles violate the\nEighth Amendment.4\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The  three dissenting opinions here each take issue with some or all\nof those precedents. See post, at 5\u20136 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.); post,\nat 1\u20136 (opinion of THOMAS, J.); post, at 1\u20134 (opinion of ALITO, J.). That\nis not surprising: their authors (and joiner) each dissented from some or\nall of those precedents. See, e.g., Kennedy, 554 U. S., at 447 (ALITO, J.,\njoined by ROBERTS, C. J., and SCALIA and THOMAS, JJ., dissenting);\nRoper, 543 U. S., at 607 (SCALIA, J., joined by THOMAS, J., dissenting);\nAtkins, 536 U. S., at 337 (SCALIA, J., joined by THOMAS, J., dissent-\ning); Thompson, 487 U. S., at 859 ((SCALIA, J., dissenting); Graham v.\nCollins, 506 U. S. 461, 487 (1993) (THOMAS, J., concurring) (contending\nthat Woodson was wrongly decided). In particular, each disagreed with\n\f8                       MILLER v. ALABAMA\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n  To start with the first set of cases: Roper and Graham\nestablish that children are constitutionally different from\nadults for purposes of sentencing. Because juveniles have\ndiminished culpability and greater prospects for reform,\nwe explained, \u201cthey are less deserving of the most severe\npunishments.\u201d Graham, 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 17).\nThose cases relied on three significant gaps between juve-\nniles and adults. First, children have a \u201c \u2018lack of maturity\nand an underdeveloped sense of responsibility,\u2019 \u201d leading to\nrecklessness, impulsivity, and heedless risk-taking. Roper,\n543 U. S., at 569. Second, children \u201care more vulner-\nable . . . to negative influences and outside pressures,\u201d\nincluding from their family and peers; they have limited\n\u201ccontro[l] over their own environment\u201d and lack the ability\nto extricate themselves from horrific, crime-producing\nsettings. Ibid. And third, a child\u2019s character is not as\n\u201cwell formed\u201d as an adult\u2019s; his traits are \u201cless fixed\u201d and\nhis actions less likely to be \u201cevidence of irretrievabl[e]\ndeprav[ity].\u201d Id., at 570.\n  Our decisions rested not only on common sense\u2014on\nwhat \u201cany parent knows\u201d\u2014but on science and social sci-\nence as well. Id., at 569. In Roper, we cited studies\nshowing that \u201c\u2018[o]nly a relatively small proportion of adoles-\ncents\u2019 \u201d who engage in illegal activity \u201c \u2018develop entrenched\npatterns of problem behavior.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 570 (quoting Stein-\nberg & Scott, Less Guilty by Reason of Adolescence: De-\nvelopmental Immaturity, Diminished Responsibility, and\nthe Juvenile Death Penalty, 58 Am. Psychologist 1009,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nthe majority\u2019s reasoning in Graham, which is the foundation stone of\nour analysis. See Graham, 560 U. S., at ___ (ROBERTS, C. J., concurring\nin judgment) (slip op., at 1); id., at ___ (THOMAS, J., joined by SCALIA\nand ALITO, JJ., dissenting) (slip op., at 1\u201325); id., at ___ (ALITO, J.,\ndissenting) (slip op., at 1). While the dissents seek to relitigate old\nEighth Amendment battles, repeating many arguments this Court has\npreviously (and often) rejected, we apply the logic of Roper, Graham,\nand our individualized sentencing decisions to these two cases.\n\f                    Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                   9\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n1014 (2003)). And in Graham, we noted that \u201cdevelop-\nments in psychology and brain science continue to show\nfundamental differences between juvenile and adult\nminds\u201d\u2014for example, in \u201cparts of the brain involved in\nbehavior control.\u201d 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 17).5 We\nreasoned that those findings\u2014of transient rashness, pro-\nclivity for risk, and inability to assess consequences\u2014both\nlessened a child\u2019s \u201cmoral culpability\u201d and enhanced the\nprospect that, as the years go by and neurological devel-\nopment occurs, his \u201c \u2018deficiencies will be reformed.\u2019 \u201d Id., at\n___ (slip op., at 18) (quoting Roper, 543 U. S., at 570).\n   Roper and Graham emphasized that the distinctive at-\ntributes of youth diminish the penological justifications\nfor imposing the harshest sentences on juvenile offenders,\neven when they commit terrible crimes. Because \u201c \u2018[t]he\nheart of the retribution rationale\u2019 \u201d relates to an offender\u2019s\nblameworthiness, \u201c \u2018the case for retribution is not as strong\nwith a minor as with an adult.\u2019 \u201d Graham, 560 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 20\u201321) (quoting Tison v. Arizona, 481 U. S.\n137, 149 (1987); Roper, 543 U. S., at 571). Nor can deter-\nrence do the work in this context, because \u201c \u2018the same\ncharacteristics that render juveniles less culpable than\nadults\u2019 \u201d\u2014their immaturity, recklessness, and impetuos-\nity\u2014make them less likely to consider potential punish-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 The evidence presented to us in these cases indicates that the sci-\n\nence and social science supporting Roper\u2019s and Graham\u2019s conclusions\nhave become even stronger. See, e.g., Brief for American Psychologi-\ncal Association et al. as Amici Curiae 3 (\u201c[A]n ever-growing body of\nresearch in developmental psychology and neuroscience continues to\nconfirm and strengthen the Court\u2019s conclusions\u201d); id., at 4 (\u201cIt is in-\ncreasingly clear that adolescent brains are not yet fully mature in\nregions and systems related to higher-order executive functions such as\nimpulse control, planning ahead, and risk avoidance\u201d); Brief for J.\nLawrence Aber et al. as Amici Curiae 12\u201328 (discussing post-Graham\nstudies); id., at 26\u201327 (\u201cNumerous studies post-Graham indicate that\nexposure to deviant peers leads to increased deviant behavior and is a\nconsistent predictor of adolescent delinquency\u201d (footnote omitted)).\n\f10                  MILLER v. ALABAMA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nment. Graham, 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 21) (quoting\nRoper, 543 U. S., at 571). Similarly, incapacitation could\nnot support the life-without-parole sentence in Graham:\nDeciding that a \u201cjuvenile offender forever will be a danger\nto society\u201d would require \u201cmak[ing] a judgment that [he]\nis incorrigible\u201d\u2014but \u201c \u2018incorrigibility is inconsistent with\nyouth.\u2019 \u201d 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 22) (quoting Work-\nman v. Commonwealth, 429 S. W. 2d 374, 378 (Ky. App.\n1968)). And for the same reason, rehabilitation could not\njustify that sentence. Life without parole \u201cforswears\naltogether the rehabilitative ideal.\u201d Graham, 560 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 23). It reflects \u201can irrevocable judgment\nabout [an offender\u2019s] value and place in society,\u201d at odds\nwith a child\u2019s capacity for change. Ibid.\n  Graham concluded from this analysis that life-without-\nparole sentences, like capital punishment, may violate\nthe Eighth Amendment when imposed on children. To be\nsure, Graham\u2019s flat ban on life without parole applied only\nto nonhomicide crimes, and the Court took care to distin-\nguish those offenses from murder, based on both moral\nculpability and consequential harm. See id., at ___ (slip\nop., at 18). But none of what it said about children\u2014about\ntheir distinctive (and transitory) mental traits and en-\nvironmental vulnerabilities\u2014is crime-specific.         Those\nfeatures are evident in the same way, and to the same de-\ngree, when (as in both cases here) a botched robbery turns\ninto a killing. So Graham\u2019s reasoning implicates any life-\nwithout-parole sentence imposed on a juvenile, even as its\ncategorical bar relates only to nonhomicide offenses.\n  Most fundamentally, Graham insists that youth matters\nin determining the appropriateness of a lifetime of incar-\nceration without the possibility of parole. In the circum-\nstances there, juvenile status precluded a life-without-\nparole sentence, even though an adult could receive it for a\nsimilar crime. And in other contexts as well, the charac-\nteristics of youth, and the way they weaken rationales for\n\f                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                   11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\npunishment, can render a life-without-parole sentence\ndisproportionate. Cf. id., at ___ (slip op., at 20\u201323) (gener-\nally doubting the penological justifications for imposing\nlife without parole on juveniles). \u201cAn offender\u2019s age,\u201d we\nmade clear in Graham, \u201cis relevant to the Eighth Amend-\nment,\u201d and so \u201ccriminal procedure laws that fail to take\ndefendants\u2019 youthfulness into account at all would be\nflawed.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 25). THE CHIEF JUSTICE,\nconcurring in the judgment, made a similar point. Al-\nthough rejecting a categorical bar on life-without-parole\nsentences for juveniles, he acknowledged \u201cRoper\u2019s conclu-\nsion that juveniles are typically less culpable than adults,\u201d\nand accordingly wrote that \u201can offender\u2019s juvenile status\ncan play a central role\u201d in considering a sentence\u2019s propor-\ntionality. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 5\u20136); see id., at ___ (slip\nop., at 12) (Graham\u2019s \u201cyouth is one factor, among others,\nthat should be considered in deciding whether his pun-\nishment was unconstitutionally excessive\u201d).6\n   But the mandatory penalty schemes at issue here pre-\nvent the sentencer from taking account of these central\nconsiderations. By removing youth from the balance\u2014\nby subjecting a juvenile to the same life-without-parole\nsentence applicable to an adult\u2014these laws prohibit a\nsentencing authority from assessing whether the law\u2019s\nharshest term of imprisonment proportionately punishes a\njuvenile offender. That contravenes Graham\u2019s (and also\nRoper\u2019s) foundational principle: that imposition of a State\u2019s\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 In discussing Graham, the dissents essentially ignore all of this\n\nreasoning. See post, at 3\u20136 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.); post, at 4\n(opinion of ALITO, J.). Indeed, THE CHIEF JUSTICE ignores the points\nmade in his own concurring opinion. The only part of Graham that the\ndissents see fit to note is the distinction it drew between homicide and\nnonhomicide offenses. See post, at 7\u20138 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.); post,\nat 4 (opinion of ALITO, J.). But contrary to the dissents\u2019 charge, our\ndecision today retains that distinction: Graham established one rule (a\nflat ban) for nonhomicide offenses, while we set out a different one\n(individualized sentencing) for homicide offenses.\n\f12                   MILLER v. ALABAMA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmost severe penalties on juvenile offenders cannot proceed\nas though they were not children.\n   And Graham makes plain these mandatory schemes\u2019\ndefects in another way: by likening life-without-parole\nsentences imposed on juveniles to the death penalty itself.\nLife-without-parole terms, the Court wrote, \u201cshare some\ncharacteristics with death sentences that are shared by no\nother sentences.\u201d 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 19). Im-\nprisoning an offender until he dies alters the remainder of\nhis life \u201cby a forfeiture that is irrevocable.\u201d Ibid. (citing\nSolem v. Helm, 463 U. S. 277, 300\u2013301 (1983)). And this\nlengthiest possible incarceration is an \u201cespecially harsh\npunishment for a juvenile,\u201d because he will almost inevi-\ntably serve \u201cmore years and a greater percentage of his life\nin prison than an adult offender.\u201d Graham, 560 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 19\u201320). The penalty when imposed on a\nteenager, as compared with an older person, is therefore\n\u201cthe same . . . in name only.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 20).\nAll of that suggested a distinctive set of legal rules: In part\nbecause we viewed this ultimate penalty for juveniles as\nakin to the death penalty, we treated it similarly to that\nmost severe punishment. We imposed a categorical ban on\nthe sentence\u2019s use, in a way unprecedented for a term of\nimprisonment. See id., at ___ (slip op., at 9); id., at ___\n(THOMAS, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 7) (\u201cFor the first time\nin its history, the Court declares an entire class of offend-\ners immune from a noncapital sentence using the categori-\ncal approach it previously reserved for death penalty cases\nalone\u201d). And the bar we adopted mirrored a proscription\nfirst established in the death penalty context\u2014that the\npunishment cannot be imposed for any nonhomicide\ncrimes against individuals. See Kennedy, 554 U. S. 407;\nCoker v. Georgia, 433 U. S. 584 (1977).\n   That correspondence\u2014Graham\u2019s \u201c[t]reat[ment] [of]\njuvenile life sentences as analogous to capital punish-\nment,\u201d 560 U. S., at ___ (ROBERTS, C.

In Woodson, 428\nU. S. 280, we held that a statute mandating a death sen-\ntence for first-degree murder violated the Eighth Amend-\nment. We thought the mandatory scheme flawed because\nit gave no significance to \u201cthe character and record of\nthe individual offender or the circumstances\u201d of the offense,\nand \u201cexclud[ed] from consideration . . . the possibility of\ncompassionate or mitigating factors.\u201d Id., at 304. Subse-\nquent decisions have elaborated on the requirement that\ncapital defendants have an opportunity to advance, and\nthe judge or jury a chance to assess, any mitigating fac-\ntors, so that the death penalty is reserved only for the\nmost culpable defendants committing the most serious\noffenses. See, e.g., Sumner v. Shuman, 483 U. S. 66, 74\u2013\n76 (1987); Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104, 110\u2013112\n(1982); Lockett, 438 U.

Texas, 509 U. S. 350,\n367 (1993). Everything we said in Roper and Graham\nabout that stage of life also appears in these decisions. As\nwe observed, \u201cyouth is more than a chronological fact.\u201d\nEddings, 455 U. S., at 115. It is a time of immaturity, ir-\nresponsibility, \u201cimpetuousness[,] and recklessness.\u201d John-\nson, 509 U. S., at 368. It is a moment and \u201ccondition\nof life when a person may be most susceptible to influence\nand to psychological damage.\u201d Eddings, 455 U. S., at 115.\nAnd its \u201csignature qualities\u201d are all \u201ctransient.\u201d Johnson,\n509 U. S., at 368. Eddings is especially on point. There, a\n16-year-old shot a police officer point-blank and killed\nhim. We invalidated his death sentence because the judge\ndid not consider evidence of his neglectful and violent\nfamily background (including his mother\u2019s drug abuse and\nhis father\u2019s physical abuse) and his emotional disturbance.\n\f14                       MILLER v. ALABAMA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nWe found that evidence \u201cparticularly relevant\u201d\u2014more so\nthan it would have been in the case of an adult offender.\n455 U. S., at 115. We held: \u201c[J]ust as the chronological age\nof a minor is itself a relevant mitigating factor of great\nweight, so must the background and mental and emotional\ndevelopment of a youthful defendant be duly considered\u201d\nin assessing his culpability. Id., at 116.\n   In light of Graham\u2019s reasoning, these decisions too show\nthe flaws of imposing mandatory life-without-parole sen-\ntences on juvenile homicide offenders. Such mandatory\npenalties, by their nature, preclude a sentencer from\ntaking account of an offender\u2019s age and the wealth of\ncharacteristics and circumstances attendant to it. Under\nthese schemes, every juvenile will receive the same sen-\ntence as every other\u2014the 17-year-old and the 14-year-old,\nthe shooter and the accomplice, the child from a stable\nhousehold and the child from a chaotic and abusive one.\nAnd still worse, each juvenile (including these two 14-\nyear-olds) will receive the same sentence as the vast ma-\njority of adults committing similar homicide offenses\u2014but\nreally, as Graham noted, a greater sentence than those\nadults will serve.7 In meting out the death penalty, the\nelision of all these differences would be strictly forbidden.\nAnd once again, Graham indicates that a similar rule\nshould apply when a juvenile confronts a sentence of life\n(and death) in prison.\n   So Graham and Roper and our individualized sentenc-\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   7 Although adults are subject as well to the death penalty in many\n\njurisdictions, very few offenders actually receive that sentence. See,\ne.g., Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, S. Rosenmerkel, M.\nDurose, & D. Farole, Felony Sentences in State Courts 2006\u2014\nStatistical Tables, p. 28 (Table 4.4) (rev. Nov. 22, 2010). So in practice,\nthe sentencing schemes at issue here result in juvenile homicide\noffenders receiving the same nominal punishment as almost all adults,\neven though the two classes differ significantly in moral culpability and\ncapacity for change.\n\f                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ning cases alike teach that in imposing a State\u2019s harshest\npenalties, a sentencer misses too much if he treats every\nchild as an adult. To recap: Mandatory life without parole\nfor a juvenile precludes consideration of his chronological\nage and its hallmark features\u2014among them, immaturity,\nimpetuosity, and failure to appreciate risks and conse-\nquences. It prevents taking into account the family and\nhome environment that surrounds him\u2014and from which\nhe cannot usually extricate himself\u2014no matter how bru-\ntal or dysfunctional. It neglects the circumstances of the\nhomicide offense, including the extent of his participation\nin the conduct and the way familial and peer pressures\nmay have affected him. Indeed, it ignores that he might\nhave been charged and convicted of a lesser offense if not\nfor incompetencies associated with youth\u2014for example,\nhis inability to deal with police officers or prosecutors\n(including on a plea agreement) or his incapacity to assist\nhis own attorneys. See, e.g., Graham, 560 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 27) (\u201c[T]he features that distinguish juveniles\nfrom adults also put them at a significant disadvantage in\ncriminal proceedings\u201d); J. D. B. v. North Carolina, 564\nU. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 5\u20136) (discussing children\u2019s\nresponses to interrogation). And finally, this mandatory\npunishment disregards the possibility of rehabilitation\neven when the circumstances most suggest it.\n   Both cases before us illustrate the problem. Take Jack-\nson\u2019s first. As noted earlier, Jackson did not fire the bullet\nthat killed Laurie Troup; nor did the State argue that\nhe intended her death. Jackson\u2019s conviction was instead\nbased on an aiding-and-abetting theory; and the appellate\ncourt affirmed the verdict only because the jury could have\nbelieved that when Jackson entered the store, he warned\nTroup that \u201c[w]e ain\u2019t playin\u2019,\u201d rather than told his friends\nthat \u201cI thought you all was playin\u2019.\u201d See 359 Ark., at\n90\u201392, 194 S. W. 3d, at 759\u2013760; supra, at 2. To be sure,\nJackson learned on the way to the video store that his\n\f16                  MILLER v. ALABAMA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfriend Shields was carrying a gun, but his age could well\nhave affected his calculation of the risk that posed, as well\nas his willingness to walk away at that point. All these\ncircumstances go to Jackson\u2019s culpability for the offense.\nSee Graham, 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 18) (\u201c[W]hen\ncompared to an adult murderer, a juvenile offender who\ndid not kill or intend to kill has a twice diminished moral\nculpability\u201d). And so too does Jackson\u2019s family background\nand immersion in violence: Both his mother and his\ngrandmother had previously shot other individuals. See\nRecord in No. 10\u20139647, pp. 80\u201382. At the least, a sen-\ntencer should look at such facts before depriving a 14-\nyear-old of any prospect of release from prison.\n   That is true also in Miller\u2019s case. No one can doubt that\nhe and Smith committed a vicious murder. But they did it\nwhen high on drugs and alcohol consumed with the adult\nvictim. And if ever a pathological background might have\ncontributed to a 14-year-old\u2019s commission of a crime, it is\nhere. Miller\u2019s stepfather physically abused him; his alco-\nholic and drug-addicted mother neglected him; he had\nbeen in and out of foster care as a result; and he had tried\nto kill himself four times, the first when he should have\nbeen in kindergarten. See 928 So. 2d, at 1081 (Cobb, J.,\nconcurring in result); Miller App. 26\u201328; supra, at 4.\nNonetheless, Miller\u2019s past criminal history was limited\u2014\ntwo instances of truancy and one of \u201csecond-degree crimi-\nnal mischief.\u201d No. CR\u201303\u20130915, at 6 (unpublished memo-\nrandum). That Miller deserved severe punishment for\nkilling Cole Cannon is beyond question. But once again,\na sentencer needed to examine all these circumstances\nbefore concluding that life without any possibility of parole\nwas the appropriate penalty.\n   We therefore hold that the Eighth Amendment forbids a\nsentencing scheme that mandates life in prison without\npossibility of parole for juvenile offenders. Cf. Graham,\n560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 24) (\u201cA State is not required\n\f                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                    17\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nto guarantee eventual freedom,\u201d but must provide \u201csome\nmeaningful opportunity to obtain release based on demon-\nstrated maturity and rehabilitation\u201d). By making youth\n(and all that accompanies it) irrelevant to imposition of\nthat harshest prison sentence, such a scheme poses too\ngreat a risk of disproportionate punishment. Because that\nholding is sufficient to decide these cases, we do not con-\nsider Jackson\u2019s and Miller\u2019s alternative argument that\nthe Eighth Amendment requires a categorical bar on life\nwithout parole for juveniles, or at least for those 14 and\nyounger. But given all we have said in Roper, Graham,\nand this decision about children\u2019s diminished culpability\nand heightened capacity for change, we think appropriate\noccasions for sentencing juveniles to this harshest possible\npenalty will be uncommon. That is especially so because\nof the great difficulty we noted in Roper and Graham of\ndistinguishing at this early age between \u201cthe juvenile of-\nfender whose crime reflects unfortunate yet transient\nimmaturity, and the rare juvenile offender whose crime\nreflects irreparable corruption.\u201d Roper, 543 U. S., at 573;\nGraham, 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 17). Although we do\nnot foreclose a sentencer\u2019s ability to make that judgment\nin homicide cases, we require it to take into account how\nchildren are different, and how those differences coun-\nsel against irrevocably sentencing them to a lifetime in\nprison.8\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 Given  our holding, and the dissents\u2019 competing position, we see a\ncertain irony in their repeated references to 17-year-olds who have\ncommitted the \u201cmost heinous\u201d offenses, and their comparison of those\ndefendants to the 14-year-olds here. See post, at 2 (opinion of ROBERTS,\nC. J.)

The States (along with the dissents) first\ncontend that the rule we adopt conflicts with aspects of\nour Eighth Amendment caselaw. And they next assert\nthat the rule is unnecessary because individualized cir-\ncumstances come into play in deciding whether to try a\njuvenile offender as an adult. We think the States are\nwrong on both counts.\n                                   A\n  The States (along with JUSTICE THOMAS) first claim that\nHarmelin v. Michigan, 501 U. S. 957 (1991), precludes our\nholding. The defendant in Harmelin was sentenced to a\nmandatory life-without-parole term for possessing more\nthan 650 grams of cocaine. The Court upheld that pen-\nalty, reasoning that \u201ca sentence which is not otherwise cruel\nand unusual\u201d does not \u201cbecom[e] so simply because it is\n\u2018mandatory.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 995. We recognized that a different\nrule, requiring individualized sentencing, applied in the\ndeath penalty context. But we refused to extend that\ncommand to noncapital cases \u201cbecause of the qualitative\ndifference between death and all other penalties.\u201d Ibid.;\nsee id., at 1006 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and\nconcurring in judgment). According to Alabama, invali-\ndating the mandatory imposition of life-without-parole\nterms on juveniles \u201cwould effectively overrule Harmelin.\u201d\nBrief for Respondent in No. 10\u20139646, p. 59 (hereinafter\nAlabama Brief); see Arkansas Brief 39.\n  We think that argument myopic. Harmelin had nothing\nto do with children and did not purport to apply its hold-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nfendants and crimes. By contrast, the sentencing schemes that the\n\ndissents find permissible altogether preclude considering these factors. \n\n\f                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ning to the sentencing of juvenile offenders. We have by\nnow held on multiple occasions that a sentencing rule\npermissible for adults may not be so for children. Capital\npunishment, our decisions hold, generally comports with\nthe Eighth Amendment\u2014except it cannot be imposed on\nchildren. See Roper, 543 U. S. 551; Thompson, 487 U. S.\n815. So too, life without parole is permissible for nonhom-\nicide offenses\u2014except, once again, for children. See Gra-\nham, 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 24). Nor are these\nsentencing decisions an oddity in the law. To the contrary,\n\u201c \u2018[o]ur history is replete with laws and judicial recogni-\ntion\u2019 that children cannot be viewed simply as miniature\nadults.\u201d J. D. B., 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10\u201311)\n(quoting Eddings, 455 U. S., at 115\u2013116, citing examples\nfrom criminal, property, contract, and tort law). So if (as\nHarmelin recognized) \u201cdeath is different,\u201d children are\ndifferent too. Indeed, it is the odd legal rule that does not\nhave some form of exception for children. In that context,\nit is no surprise that the law relating to society\u2019s harshest\npunishments recognizes such a distinction. Cf. Graham,\n560 U. S., at ___ (ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment)\n(slip op., at 7) (\u201cGraham\u2019s age places him in a significantly\ndifferent category from the defendan[t] in . . . Harmelin\u201d).\nOur ruling thus neither overrules nor undermines nor con-\nflicts with Harmelin.\n    Alabama and Arkansas (along with THE CHIEF JUS-\nTICE and JUSTICE ALITO) next contend that because many\nStates impose mandatory life-without-parole sentences on\njuveniles, we may not hold the practice unconstitutional.\nIn considering categorical bars to the death penalty and\nlife without parole, we ask as part of the analysis whether\n\u201c \u2018objective indicia of society\u2019s standards, as expressed in\nlegislative enactments and state practice,\u2019 \u201d show a \u201cna-\ntional consensus\u201d against a sentence for a particular class\nof offenders. Graham, 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10)\n(quoting Roper, 543 U. S., at 563). By our count, 29 juris-\n\f20                      MILLER v. ALABAMA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ndictions (28 States and the Federal Government) make\na life-without-parole term mandatory for some juveniles\nconvicted of murder in adult court.9 The States argue that\nthis number precludes our holding.\n  We do not agree; indeed, we think the States\u2019 argument\non this score weaker than the one we rejected in Graham.\nFor starters, the cases here are different from the typical\none in which we have tallied legislative enactments. Our\ndecision does not categorically bar a penalty for a class\nof offenders or type of crime\u2014as, for example, we did in\nRoper or Graham. Instead, it mandates only that a sen-\ntencer follow a certain process\u2014considering an offender\u2019s\nyouth and attendant characteristics\u2014before imposing a\nparticular penalty. And in so requiring, our decision flows\nstraightforwardly from our precedents: specifically, the\nprinciple of Roper, Graham, and our individualized sen-\ntencing cases that youth matters for purposes of meting\nout the law\u2019s most serious punishments. When both of\nthose circumstances have obtained in the past, we have\nnot scrutinized or relied in the same way on legislative\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 The  States note that 26 States and the Federal Government make\nlife without parole the mandatory (or mandatory minimum) punish-\nment for some form of murder, and would apply the relevant provision\nto 14-year-olds (with many applying it to even younger defendants).\nSee Alabama Brief 17\u201318. In addition, life without parole is mandatory\nfor older juveniles in Louisiana (age 15 and up) and Texas (age 17). See\nLa. Child. Code Ann., Arts. 857(A), (B) (West Supp. 2012); La. Rev.\nStat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a714:30(C), 14:30.1(B) (West Supp. 2012); Tex. Family Code\nAnn. \u00a7\u00a751.02(2)(A), 54.02(a)(2)(A) (West Supp. 2011); Tex. Penal Code\nAnn. \u00a712.31(a) (West 2011). In many of these jurisdictions, life without\nparole is the mandatory punishment only for aggravated forms of\nmurder. That distinction makes no difference to our analysis. We have\nconsistently held that limiting a mandatory death penalty law to\nparticular kinds of murder cannot cure the law\u2019s \u201cconstitutional vice\u201d of\ndisregarding the \u201ccircumstances of the particular offense and the\ncharacter and propensities of the offender.\u201d Roberts v. Louisiana, 428\nU. S. 325, 333 (1976) (plurality opinion); see Sumner v. Shuman, 483\nU. S. 66 (1987). The same analysis applies here, for the same reasons.\n\f                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                    21\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nenactments. See, e.g., Sumner v. Shuman, 483 U. S. 66\n(relying on Woodson\u2019s logic to prohibit the mandatory\ndeath penalty for murderers already serving life without\nparole); Lockett, 438 U. S., at 602\u2013608 (plurality opinion)\n(applying Woodson to require that judges and juries\nconsider all mitigating evidence); Eddings, 455 U. S., at\n110\u2013117 (similar). We see no difference here.\n  In any event, the \u201cobjective indicia\u201d that the States offer\ndo not distinguish these cases from others holding that\na sentencing practice violates the Eighth Amendment. In\nGraham, we prohibited life-without-parole terms for\njuveniles committing nonhomicide offenses even though\n39 jurisdictions permitted that sentence. See 560 U. S.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 11). That is 10 more than impose life\nwithout parole on juveniles on a mandatory basis.10 And\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   10 In assessing indicia of societal standards, Graham discussed \u201cac-\n\ntual sentencing practices\u201d in addition to legislative enactments, noting\nhow infrequently sentencers imposed the statutorily available penalty.\n560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11). Here, we consider the constitutional-\nity of mandatory sentencing schemes\u2014which by definition remove a\njudge\u2019s or jury\u2019s discretion\u2014so no comparable gap between legislation\nand practice can exist. Rather than showing whether sentencers\nconsider life without parole for juvenile homicide offenders appropriate,\nthe number of juveniles serving this sentence, see post, at 1, 3\u20134\n(ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting), merely reflects the number who have com-\nmitted homicide in mandatory-sentencing jurisdictions. For the same\nreason, THE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2019s comparison of ratios in this case and Gra-\nham carries little weight. He contrasts the number of mandatory\nlife-without-parole sentences for juvenile murderers, relative to the\nnumber of juveniles arrested for murder, with \u201cthe corresponding\nnumber\u201d of sentences in Graham (i.e., the number of life-without-parole\nsentences for juveniles who committed serious nonhomicide crimes, as\ncompared to arrests for those crimes). Post, at 4. But because the\nmandatory nature of the sentences here necessarily makes them more\ncommon, THE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2019s figures do not \u201ccorrespon[d]\u201d at all. The\nhigher ratio is mostly a function of removing the sentencer\u2019s discretion.\n   Where mandatory sentencing does not itself account for the number\nof juveniles serving life-without-parole terms, the evidence we have of\npractice supports our holding. Fifteen jurisdictions make life without\n\f22                      MILLER v. ALABAMA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nin Atkins, Roper, and Thompson, we similarly banned the\ndeath penalty in circumstances in which \u201cless than half \u201d\nof the \u201cStates that permit[ted] capital punishment (for\nwhom the issue exist[ed])\u201d had previously chosen to do so.\nAtkins, 536 U. S., at 342 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (emphasis\ndeleted); see id., at 313\u2013315 (majority opinion); Roper, 543\nU. S., at 564\u2013565; Thompson, 487 U. S., at 826\u2013827 (plu-\nrality opinion). So we are breaking no new ground in\nthese cases.11\n  Graham and Thompson provide special guidance, be-\ncause they considered the same kind of statutes we do and\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nparole discretionary for juveniles. See Alabama Brief 25 (listing 12\nStates); Cal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7190.5(b) (West 2008); Ind. Code \u00a735\u201350\u2013\n2\u20133(b) (2011); N. M. Stat. \u00a7\u00a731\u201318\u201313(B), 31\u201318\u201314, 31\u201318\u201315.2 (2010).\nAccording to available data, only about 15% of all juvenile life-without-\nparole sentences come from those 15 jurisdictions, while 85% come from\nthe 29 mandatory ones. See Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 10\u20139646, p. 19;\nHuman Rights Watch, State Distribution of Youth Offenders Serv-\ning Juvenile Life Without Parole (JLWOP), Oct. 2, 2009, online at\nhttp://www.hrw.org/news/2009/10/02/state-distribution-juvenile-offenders-\nserving-juvenile-life-without-parole (as visited June 21, 2012, and\navailable in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file). That figure indicates that when\ngiven the choice, sentencers impose life without parole on children\nrelatively rarely. And contrary to THE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2019s argument, see\npost, at 5, n. 2, we have held that when judges and juries do not often\nchoose to impose a sentence, it at least should not be mandatory. See\nWoodson v. North Carolina, 428 U. S. 280, 295\u2013296 (1976) (plurality\nopinion) (relying on the infrequency with which juries imposed the\ndeath penalty when given discretion to hold that its mandatory imposi-\ntion violates the Eighth Amendment).\n   11 In response, THE CHIEF JUSTICE complains: \u201cTo say that a sentence\n\nmay be considered unusual because so many legislatures approve it\nstands precedent on its head.\u201d Post, at 5. To be clear: That description\nin no way resembles our opinion. We hold that the sentence violates\nthe Eighth Amendment because, as we have exhaustively shown, it\nconflicts with the fundamental principles of Roper, Graham, and our\nindividualized sentencing cases. We then show why the number of\nStates imposing this punishment does not preclude our holding, and\nnote how its mandatory nature (in however many States adopt it)\nmakes use of actual sentencing numbers unilluminating.\n\f                    Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                 23\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nexplained why simply counting them would present a\ndistorted view. Most jurisdictions authorized the death\npenalty or life without parole for juveniles only through\nthe combination of two independent statutory provisions.\nOne allowed the transfer of certain juvenile offenders to\nadult court, while another (often in a far-removed part of\nthe code) set out the penalties for any and all individuals\ntried there. We reasoned that in those circumstances, it\nwas impossible to say whether a legislature had endorsed\na given penalty for children (or would do so if presented\nwith the choice). In Thompson, we found that the statutes\n\u201ct[old] us that the States consider 15-year-olds to be old\nenough to be tried in criminal court for serious crimes (or\ntoo old to be dealt with effectively in juvenile court),\nbut t[old] us nothing about the judgment these States\nhave made regarding the appropriate punishment for such\nyouthful offenders.\u201d 487 U.

And Graham echoed that\nreasoning: Although the confluence of state laws \u201cma[de]\nlife without parole possible for some juvenile nonhomicide\noffenders,\u201d it did not \u201cjustify a judgment\u201d that many\nStates actually \u201cintended to subject such offenders\u201d to\nthose sentences. 560 U.

But\nneither Graham nor Thompson suggested such reasoning, presumably\nbecause the time frame makes it difficult to comprehend. Those cases\nconsidered what legislators intended when they enacted, at different\nmoments, separate juvenile-transfer and life-without-parole provi-\nsions\u2014by definition, before they knew or could know how many juve-\nnile life-without-parole sentences would result.\n\f24                      MILLER v.

But\nmost States do not have separate penalty provisions for\nthose juvenile offenders. Of the 29 jurisdictions mandat-\ning life without parole for children, more than half do so\nby virtue of generally applicable penalty provisions, im-\nposing the sentence without regard to age.13 And indeed,\nsome of those States set no minimum age for who may be\ntransferred to adult court in the first instance, thus apply-\ning life-without-parole mandates to children of any age\u2014\nbe it 17 or 14 or 10 or 6.14 As in Graham, we think that\n\u201cunderscores that the statutory eligibility of a juvenile\noffender for life without parole does not indicate that the\npenalty has been endorsed through deliberate, express,\nand full legislative consideration.\u201d 560 U.

Of the\n29 relevant jurisdictions, about half place at least some\njuvenile homicide offenders in adult court automatically,\nwith no apparent opportunity to seek transfer to juvenile\ncourt.15 Moreover, several States at times lodge this deci-\nsion exclusively in the hands of prosecutors, again with\nno statutory mechanism for judicial reevaluation.16 And\nthose \u201cprosecutorial discretion laws are usually silent\nregarding standards, protocols, or appropriate considera-\ntions for decisionmaking.\u201d Dept. of Justice, Office of Juve-\nnile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, P.

ALABAMA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nAdults: An Analysis of State Transfer Laws and Reporting\n5 (2011).\n   Even when States give transfer-stage discretion to\njudges, it has limited utility. First, the decisionmaker\ntypically will have only partial information at this early,\npretrial stage about either the child or the circumstances\nof his offense. Miller\u2019s case provides an example. As\nnoted earlier, see n. 3, supra, the juvenile court denied\nMiller\u2019s request for his own mental-health expert at the\ntransfer hearing, and the appeals court affirmed on the\nground that Miller was not then entitled to the protections\nand services he would receive at trial. See No. CR\u201303\u2013\n0915, at 3\u20134 (unpublished memorandum). But by then, of\ncourse, the expert\u2019s testimony could not change the sen-\ntence; whatever she said in mitigation, the mandatory\nlife-without-parole prison term would kick in. The key mo-\nment for the exercise of discretion is the transfer\u2014and as\nMiller\u2019s case shows, the judge often does not know then\nwhat she will learn, about the offender or the offense, over\nthe course of the proceedings.\n   Second and still more important, the question at trans-\nfer hearings may differ dramatically from the issue at a\npost-trial sentencing. Because many juvenile systems\nrequire that the offender be released at a particular age or\nafter a certain number of years, transfer decisions often\npresent a choice between extremes: light punishment as a\nchild or standard sentencing as an adult (here, life without\nparole). In many States, for example, a child convicted in\njuvenile court must be released from custody by the age of\n21. See, e.g., Ala. Code \u00a712\u201315\u2013117(a) (Cum. Supp. 2011);\nsee generally 2006 National Report 103 (noting limitations\non the length of juvenile court sanctions). Discretionary\nsentencing in adult court would provide different options:\nThere, a judge or jury could choose, rather than a life-\nwithout-parole sentence, a lifetime prison term with the\npossibility of parole or a lengthy term of years. It is easy\n\f                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           27\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nto imagine a judge deciding that a minor deserves a\n(much) harsher sentence than he would receive in juvenile\ncourt, while still not thinking life-without-parole appro-\npriate. For that reason, the discretion available to a judge\nat the transfer stage cannot substitute for discretion at\npost-trial sentencing in adult court\u2014and so cannot satisfy\nthe Eighth Amendment.\n                             IV\n   Graham, Roper, and our individualized sentencing\ndecisions make clear that a judge or jury must have the\nopportunity to consider mitigating circumstances before\nimposing the harshest possible penalty for juveniles. By\nrequiring that all children convicted of homicide receive\nlifetime incarceration without possibility of parole, regard-\nless of their age and age-related characteristics and the\nnature of their crimes, the mandatory sentencing schemes\nbefore us violate this principle of proportionality, and so\nthe Eighth Amendment\u2019s ban on cruel and unusual pun-\nishment. We accordingly reverse the judgments of the\nArkansas Supreme Court and Alabama Court of Criminal\nAppeals and remand the cases for further proceedings not\ninconsistent with this opinion.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n\f                  Cite as: 567 U.

Graham v. Florida, 560 U. S. ___,\n___ (2010) (slip op., at 18).

For another thing,\nGraham recognized that lack of intent normally dimin-\nishes the \u201cmoral culpability\u201d that attaches to the crime in\nquestion, making those that do not intend to kill \u201ccategori-\ncally less deserving of the most serious forms of punish-\nment than are murderers.\u201d 560 U.

Quite simply, if the juvenile\neither kills or intends to kill the victim, he lacks \u201ctwice\ndiminished\u201d responsibility. But where the juvenile neither\nkills nor intends to kill, both features emphasized in Gra-\nham as extenuating apply. The dissent itself here would\npermit life without parole for \u201cjuveniles who commit the\nworst types of murder,\u201d post, at 7 (opinion of ROBERTS,\nC. J.), but that phrase does not readily fit the culpability of\none who did not himself kill or intend to kill.\n  I recognize that in the context of felony-murder cases,\nthe question of intent is a complicated one. The felony-\n\f                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                     BREYER, J., concurring\n\nmurder doctrine traditionally attributes death caused in\nthe course of a felony to all participants who intended to\ncommit the felony, regardless of whether they killed or\nintended to kill. See 2 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal\nLaw \u00a7\u00a714.5(a) and (c) (2d ed. 2003). This rule has been\nbased on the idea of \u201ctransferred intent\u201d; the defendant\u2019s\nintent to commit the felony satisfies the intent to kill\nrequired for murder. See S. Kadish, S. Schulhofer, & C.\nStreiker, Criminal Law and Its Processes 439 (8th ed.\n2007); 2 C. Torcia, Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law \u00a7147 (15th ed.\n1994).\n   But in my opinion, this type of \u201ctransferred intent\u201d is\nnot sufficient to satisfy the intent to murder that could\nsubject a juvenile to a sentence of life without parole. As\nan initial matter, this Court has made clear that this\nartificially constructed kind of intent does not count as\nintent for purposes of the Eighth Amendment. We do not\nrely on transferred intent in determining if an adult may\nreceive the death penalty. Thus, the Constitution forbids\nimposing capital punishment upon an aider and abettor in\na robbery, where that individual did not intend to kill and\nsimply was \u201cin the car by the side of the road . . . , waiting\nto help the robbers escape.\u201d Enmund, supra, at 788. Cf.\nTison, supra, at 157\u2013158 (capital punishment permissi-\nble for aider and abettor where kidnaping led to death\nbecause he was \u201cactively involved\u201d in every aspect of the\nkidnaping and his behavior showed \u201ca reckless disregard\nfor human life\u201d). Given Graham, this holding applies to\njuvenile sentences of life without parole a fortiori. See\nante, at 12\u201313. Indeed, even juveniles who meet the Tison\nstandard of \u201creckless disregard\u201d may not be eligible for life\nwithout parole. Rather, Graham dictates a clear rule: The\nonly juveniles who may constitutionally be sentenced to\nlife without parole are those convicted of homicide offenses\nwho \u201ckill or intend to kill.\u201d 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 18).\n\f4                    MILLER v. ALABAMA\n\n                     BREYER, J., concurring\n\n   Moreover, regardless of our law with respect to adults,\nthere is no basis for imposing a sentence of life without\nparole upon a juvenile who did not himself kill or intend to\nkill. At base, the theory of transferring a defendant\u2019s\nintent is premised on the idea that one engaged in a dan-\ngerous felony should understand the risk that the victim\nof the felony could be killed, even by a confederate. See 2\nLaFave, supra, \u00a714.5(c). Yet the ability to consider the\nfull consequences of a course of action and to adjust one\u2019s\nconduct accordingly is precisely what we know juveniles\nlack capacity to do effectively. Ante, at 8\u20139. Justice Frank-\nfurter cautioned, \u201cLegal theories and their phrasing in\nother cases readily lead to fallacious reasoning if uncrit-\nically transferred to a determination of a State\u2019s duty to-\nward children.\u201d May v. Anderson, 345 U. S. 528, 536\n(1953) (concurring opinion). To apply the doctrine of\ntransferred intent here, where the juvenile did not kill, to\nsentence a juvenile to life without parole would involve\nsuch \u201cfallacious reasoning.\u201d Ibid.\n   This is, as far as I can tell, precisely the situation pres-\nent in Kuntrell Jackson\u2019s case. Jackson simply went\nalong with older boys to rob a video store. On the way, he\nbecame aware that a confederate had a gun. He initially\nstayed outside the store, and went in briefly, saying some-\nthing like \u201cWe ain\u2019t playin\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018I thought you all was\nplayin,\u2019 \u201d before an older confederate shot and killed the\nstore clerk. Jackson v. State, 359 Ark. 87, 91, 194 S. W. 3d\n757, 760 (2004). Crucially, the jury found him guilty of\nfirst-degree murder under a statute that permitted them\nto convict if, Jackson \u201cattempted to commit or committed\nan aggravated robbery, and, in the course of that of-\nfense, he, or an accomplice, caused [the clerk\u2019s] death\nunder circumstance manifesting extreme indifference to the\nvalue of human life.\u201d Ibid. See Ark. Code Ann. \u00a75\u201310\u2013\n101(a)(1) (1997); ante, at 15. Thus, to be found guilty,\nJackson did not need to kill the clerk (it is conceded he did\n\f                  Cite as: 567 U.

Ibid.\n   The upshot is that Jackson, who did not kill the clerk,\nmight not have intended to do so either. See Jackson v.\nNorris, 2011 Ark. 49, at 10, ___ S. W. 3d ___ (Danielson,\nJ., dissenting) (\u201c[A]ny evidence of [Jackson\u2019s] intent to kill\nwas severely lacking\u201d). In that case, the Eighth Amend-\nment simply forbids imposition of a life term without the\npossibility of parole. If, on remand, however, there is a\nfinding that Jackson did intend to cause the clerk\u2019s death,\nthe question remains open whether the Eighth Amend-\nment prohibits the imposition of life without parole upon a\njuvenile in those circumstances as well.

Our role, however, is to\napply the law, not to answer such questions. The perti-\nnent law here is the Eighth Amendment to the Constitu-\ntion, which prohibits \u201ccruel and unusual punishments.\u201d\nToday, the Court invokes that Amendment to ban a pun-\nishment that the Court does not itself characterize as un-\nusual, and that could not plausibly be described as such.\nI therefore dissent.\n   The parties agree that nearly 2,500 prisoners are pres-\nently serving life sentences without the possibility of pa-\nrole for murders they committed before the age of 18.\nBrief for Petitioner in No. 10\u20139647, p. 62, n. 80 (Jackson\n\f2                    MILLER v.

The Court accepts that over 2,000 of those\nprisoners received that sentence because it was mandated\nby a legislature. Ante, at 22, n. 10. And it recognizes\nthat the Federal Government and most States impose such\nmandatory sentences. Ante, at 19\u201320. Put simply, if a 17-\nyear-old is convicted of deliberately murdering an innocent\nvictim, it is not \u201cunusual\u201d for the murderer to receive a\nmandatory sentence of life without parole. That reality\nshould preclude finding that mandatory life imprisonment\nfor juvenile killers violates the Eighth Amendment.\n   Our precedent supports this conclusion. When deter-\nmining whether a punishment is cruel and unusual, this\nCourt typically begins with \u201c \u2018objective indicia of society\u2019s\nstandards, as expressed in legislative enactments and\nstate practice.\u2019 \u201d Graham v. Florida, 560 U. S. ___, ___\n(2010) (slip op., at 10); see also, e.g., Kennedy v. Louisiana,\n554 U. S. 407, 422 (2008); Roper v. Simmons, 543\nU. S. 551, 564 (2005). We look to these \u201cobjective indicia\u201d to\nensure that we are not simply following our own subjective\nvalues or beliefs. Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 173\n(1976) (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.).\nSuch tangible evidence of societal standards enables us to\ndetermine whether there is a \u201cconsensus against\u201d a given\nsentencing practice. Graham, supra, at ___ (slip op., at\n10). If there is, the punishment may be regarded as \u201cun-\nusual.\u201d But when, as here, most States formally require\nand frequently impose the punishment in question, there\nis no objective basis for that conclusion.\n   Our Eighth Amendment cases have also said that we\nshould take guidance from \u201cevolving standards of decency\nthat mark the progress of a maturing society.\u201d Ante, at 6\n(quoting Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U. S. 97, 102 (1976); inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted). Mercy toward the guilty\ncan be a form of decency, and a maturing society may\nabandon harsh punishments that it comes to view as\n\f                 Cite as: 567 U.

A mature society may determine that this re-\nquires removing those guilty of the most heinous murders\nfrom its midst, both as protection for its other members\nand as a concrete expression of its standards of decency.\nAs judges we have no basis for deciding that progress\ntoward greater decency can move only in the direction of\neasing sanctions on the guilty.\n   In this case, there is little doubt about the direction of\nsociety\u2019s evolution: For most of the 20th century, American\nsentencing practices emphasized rehabilitation of the\noffender and the availability of parole. But by the 1980\u2019s,\noutcry against repeat offenders, broad disaffection with\nthe rehabilitative model, and other factors led many legis-\nlatures to reduce or eliminate the possibility of parole,\nimposing longer sentences in order to punish criminals\nand prevent them from committing more crimes. See, e.g.,\nAlschuler, The Changing Purposes of Criminal Punish-\nment, 70 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1, 1\u201313 (2003); see generally\nCrime and Public Policy (J. Wilson & J. Petersilia eds.\n2011). Statutes establishing life without parole sentences\nin particular became more common in the past quarter\ncentury. See Baze v. Rees, 553 U. S. 35, 78, and n. 10\n(2008) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment). And the\nparties agree that most States have changed their laws\nrelatively recently to expose teenage murderers to manda-\ntory life without parole. Jackson Brief 54\u201355; Alabama\nBrief 4\u20135.\n   The Court attempts to avoid the import of the fact that\nso many jurisdictions have embraced the sentencing prac-\ntice at issue by comparing this case to the Court\u2019s prior\nEighth Amendment cases. The Court notes that Graham\nfound a punishment authorized in 39 jurisdictions uncon-\nstitutional, whereas the punishment it bans today is\nmandated in 10 fewer. Ante, at 21. But Graham went to\n\f4                        MILLER v. ALABAMA\n\n                       ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nconsiderable lengths to show that although theoretically\nallowed in many States, the sentence at issue in that case\nwas \u201cexceedingly rare\u201d in practice. 560 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 16). The Court explained that only 123 prisoners\nin the entire Nation were serving life without parole for\nnonhomicide crimes committed as juveniles, with more\nthan half in a single State. It contrasted that with statis-\ntics showing nearly 400,000 juveniles were arrested for\nserious nonhomicide offenses in a single year. Based on\nthe sentence\u2019s rarity despite the many opportunities to im-\npose it, Graham concluded that there was a national\nconsensus against life without parole for juvenile nonhom-\nicide crimes. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 13\u201316).\n   Here the number of mandatory life without parole sen-\ntences for juvenile murderers, relative to the number of\njuveniles arrested for murder, is over 5,000 times higher\nthan the corresponding number in Graham. There is thus\nnothing in this case like the evidence of national consen-\nsus in Graham.1\n   The Court disregards these numbers, claiming that the\nprevalence of the sentence in question results from the\nnumber of statutes requiring its imposition. Ante, at 21,\nn. 10. True enough. The sentence at issue is statutorily\nmandated life without parole. Such a sentence can only\nresult from statutes requiring its imposition. In Graham\nthe Court relied on the low number of actual sentences to\nexplain why the high number of statutes allowing such\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Graham stated that 123 prisoners were serving life without parole\n\nfor nonhomicide offenses committed as juveniles, while in 2007 alone\n380,480 juveniles were arrested for serious nonhomicide crimes. 560\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13\u201314). I use 2,000 as the number of prisoners\nserving mandatory life without parole sentences for murders committed\nas juveniles, because all seem to accept that the number is at least that\nhigh. And the same source Graham used reports that 1,170 juveniles\nwere arrested for murder and nonnegligent homicide in 2009. Dept.\nof Justice, Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention,\nC. Puzzanchera & B. Adams, Juvenile Arrests 2009, p. 4 (Dec. 2011).\n\f                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                     5\n\n                       ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nsentences was not dispositive. Here, the Court excuses\nthe high number of actual sentences by citing the high\nnumber of statutes imposing it. To say that a sentence\nmay be considered unusual because so many legislatures\napprove it stands precedent on its head.2\n  The Court also advances another reason for discounting\nthe laws enacted by Congress and most state legisla-\ntures. Some of the jurisdictions that impose mandatory life\nwithout parole on juvenile murderers do so as a result of\ntwo statutes: one providing that juveniles charged with\nserious crimes may be tried as adults, and another gener-\nally mandating that those convicted of murder be impris-\noned for life. According to the Court, our cases suggest\nthat where the sentence results from the interaction of two\nsuch statutes, the legislature can be considered to have\nimposed the resulting sentences \u201cinadvertent[ly].\u201d Ante,\nat 22\u201325. The Court relies on Graham and Thompson v.\nOklahoma, 487 U. S. 815, 826, n. 24 (1988) (plurality\nopinion), for the proposition that these laws are therefore\nnot valid evidence of society\u2019s views on the punishment at\nissue.\n  It is a fair question whether this Court should ever\nassume a legislature is so ignorant of its own laws that it\ndoes not understand that two of them interact with each\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 The Court\u2019s reference to discretionary sentencing practices is a dis-\n\ntraction. See ante, at 21\u201322, n. 10. The premise of the Court\u2019s decision\nis that mandatory sentences are categorically different from discretion-\nary ones. So under the Court\u2019s own logic, whether discretionary sen-\ntences are common or uncommon has nothing to do with whether\nmandatory sentences are unusual. In any event, if analysis of discre-\ntionary sentences were relevant, it would not provide objective support\nfor today\u2019s decision. The Court states that \u201cabout 15% of all juvenile\nlife-without-parole sentences\u201d\u2014meaning nearly 400 sentences\u2014were\nimposed at the discretion of a judge or jury. Ante, at 22, n. 10. Thus\nthe number of discretionary life without parole sentences for juvenile\nmurderers, relative to the number of juveniles arrested for murder, is\nabout 1,000 times higher than the corresponding number in Graham.\n\f6                       MILLER v. ALABAMA\n\n                       ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nother, especially on an issue of such importance as the one\nbefore us. But in Graham and Thompson it was at least\nplausible as a practical matter. In Graham, the extreme\nrarity with which the sentence in question was imposed\ncould suggest that legislatures did not really intend the\ninevitable result of the laws they passed. See 560 U. S.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 15\u201316). In Thompson, the sentencing\npractice was even rarer\u2014only 20 defendants had received\nit in the last century. 487 U. S., at 832 (plurality opinion).\nPerhaps under those facts it could be argued that the leg-\nislature was not fully aware that a teenager could re-\nceive the particular sentence in question. But here the\nwidespread and recent imposition of the sentence makes it\nimplausible to characterize this sentencing practice as a\ncollateral consequence of legislative ignorance.3\n   Nor do we display our usual respect for elected officials\nby asserting that legislators have accidentally required\n2,000 teenagers to spend the rest of their lives in jail. This\nis particularly true given that our well-publicized decision\nin Graham alerted legislatures to the possibility that\nteenagers were subject to life with parole only because of\nlegislative inadvertence. I am aware of no effort in the\nwake of Graham to correct any supposed legislative over-\nsight. Indeed, in amending its laws in response to Gra-\nham one legislature made especially clear that it does\nintend juveniles who commit first-degree murder to re-\nceive mandatory life without parole. See Iowa Code Ann.\n\u00a7902.1 (West Cum. Supp. 2012).\n   In the end, the Court does not actually conclude that\nmandatory life sentences for juvenile murderers are un-\nusual. It instead claims that precedent \u201cleads to\u201d today\u2019s\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    3 The\n        Court claims that I \u201ctake issue with some or all of these prece-\ndents\u201d and \u201cseek to relitigate\u201d them. Ante, at 7\u20138, n. 4. Not so: apply-\ning this Court\u2019s cases exactly as they stand, I do not believe they\nsupport the Court\u2019s decision in this case.\n\f                  Cite as: 567 U.

Petitioners argue that the reasoning of those cases\n\u201ccompels\u201d finding in their favor. Jackson Brief 34. The\nCourt is apparently unwilling to go so far, asserting only\nthat precedent points in that direction. But today\u2019s deci-\nsion invalidates the laws of dozens of legislatures and\nCongress. This Court is not easily led to such a result.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Harris, 106 U. S. 629, 635 (1883)\n(courts must presume an Act of Congress is constitutional\n\u201cunless the lack of constitutional authority . . . is clearly\ndemonstrated\u201d). Because the Court does not rely on the\nEighth Amendment\u2019s text or objective evidence of society\u2019s\nstandards, its analysis of precedent alone must bear the\n\u201cheavy burden [that] rests on those who would attack the\njudgment of the representatives of the people.\u201d Gregg, 428\nU. S., at 175. If the Court is unwilling to say that prece-\ndent compels today\u2019s decision, perhaps it should reconsider\nthat decision.\n  In any event, the Court\u2019s holding does not follow from\nRoper and Graham. Those cases undoubtedly stand for\nthe proposition that teenagers are less mature, less re-\nsponsible, and less fixed in their ways than adults\u2014not\nthat a Supreme Court case was needed to establish that.\nWhat they do not stand for, and do not even suggest, is\nthat legislators\u2014who also know that teenagers are differ-\nent from adults\u2014may not require life without parole for\njuveniles who commit the worst types of murder.\n  That Graham does not imply today\u2019s result could not be\nclearer. In barring life without parole for juvenile non-\nhomicide offenders, Graham stated that \u201c[t]here is a line\n\u2018between homicide and other serious violent offenses\nagainst the individual.\u2019 \u201d 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 18)\n(quoting Kennedy, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 27)). The\nwhole point of drawing a line between one issue and an-\nother is to say that they are different and should be\ntreated differently. In other words, the two are in different\n\f8                    MILLER v. ALABAMA\n\n                    ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\ncategories. Which Graham also said: \u201cdefendants who do\nnot kill, intend to kill, or foresee that life will be taken are\ncategorically less deserving of the most serious forms of\npunishment than are murderers.\u201d 560 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 18) (emphasis added). Of course, to be especially\nclear that what is said about one issue does not apply to\nanother, one could say that the two issues cannot be com-\npared. Graham said that too: \u201cSerious nonhomicide\ncrimes . . . cannot be compared to murder.\u201d Ibid. (internal\nquotation marks omitted). A case that expressly puts an\nissue in a different category from its own subject, draws a\nline between the two, and states that the two should not\nbe compared, cannot fairly be said to control that issue.\n   Roper provides even less support for the Court\u2019s holding.\nIn that case, the Court held that the death penalty could\nnot be imposed for offenses committed by juveniles, no\nmatter how serious their crimes. In doing so, Roper also\nset itself in a different category than this case, by ex-\npressly invoking \u201cspecial\u201d Eighth Amendment analysis for\ndeath penalty cases. 543 U. S., at 568\u2013569. But more\nimportantly, Roper reasoned that the death penalty was\nnot needed to deter juvenile murderers in part because\n\u201clife imprisonment without the possibility of parole\u201d was\navailable. Id., at 572. In a classic bait and switch, the\nCourt now tells state legislatures that\u2014Roper\u2019s promise\nnotwithstanding\u2014they do not have power to guarantee\nthat once someone commits a heinous murder, he will\nnever do so again. It would be enough if today\u2019s decision\nproved JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s prescience in writing that Roper\u2019s\n\u201creassurance . . . gives little comfort.\u201d Id., at 623 (dissent-\ning opinion). To claim that Roper actually \u201cleads to\u201d re-\nvoking its own reassurance surely goes too far.\n   Today\u2019s decision does not offer Roper and Graham\u2019s\nfalse promises of restraint. Indeed, the Court\u2019s opinion\nsuggests that it is merely a way station on the path to\nfurther judicial displacement of the legislative role in\n\f                 Cite as: 567 U.

The\nCourt\u2019s analysis focuses on the mandatory nature of the\nsentences in this case. See ante, at 11\u201317. But then\u2014\nalthough doing so is entirely unnecessary to the rule it\nannounces\u2014the Court states that even when a life with-\nout parole sentence is not mandatory, \u201cwe think appropri-\nate occasions for sentencing juveniles to this harshest\npossible penalty will be uncommon.\u201d Ante, at 17. Today\u2019s\nholding may be limited to mandatory sentences, but the\nCourt has already announced that discretionary life with-\nout parole for juveniles should be \u201cuncommon\u201d\u2014or, to use\na common synonym, \u201cunusual.\u201d\n   Indeed, the Court\u2019s gratuitous prediction appears to be\nnothing other than an invitation to overturn life without\nparole sentences imposed by juries and trial judges. If\nthat invitation is widely accepted and such sentences for\njuvenile offenders do in fact become \u201cuncommon,\u201d the\nCourt will have bootstrapped its way to declaring that the\nEighth Amendment absolutely prohibits them.\n   This process has no discernible end point\u2014or at least\nnone consistent with our Nation\u2019s legal traditions. Roper\nand Graham attempted to limit their reasoning to the\ncircumstances they addressed\u2014Roper to the death penalty,\nand Graham to nonhomicide crimes. Having cast aside\nthose limits, the Court cannot now offer a credible substi-\ntute, and does not even try. After all, the Court tells us,\n\u201cnone of what [Graham] said about children . . . is crime-\nspecific.\u201d Ante, at 10. The principle behind today\u2019s deci-\nsion seems to be only that because juveniles are different\nfrom adults, they must be sentenced differently. See ante,\nat 14\u201317. There is no clear reason that principle would\nnot bar all mandatory sentences for juveniles, or any\njuvenile sentence as harsh as what a similarly situated\nadult would receive. Unless confined, the only stopping\npoint for the Court\u2019s analysis would be never permitting\njuvenile offenders to be tried as adults. Learning that an\n\f10                  MILLER v. ALABAMA\n\n                  ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nAmendment that bars only \u201cunusual\u201d punishments re-\nquires the abolition of this uniformly established practice\nwould be startling indeed.\n                        *     *    *\n  It is a great tragedy when a juvenile commits murder\u2014\nmost of all for the innocent victims. But also for the mur-\nderer, whose life has gone so wrong so early. And for\nsociety as well, which has lost one or more of its members\nto deliberate violence, and must harshly punish another.\nIn recent years, our society has moved toward requiring\nthat the murderer, his age notwithstanding, be imprisoned\nfor the remainder of his life. Members of this Court may\ndisagree with that choice. Perhaps science and policy\nsuggest society should show greater mercy to young kill-\ners, giving them a greater chance to reform themselves at\nthe risk that they will kill again. See ante, at 8\u201311. But\nthat is not our decision to make. Neither the text of the\nConstitution nor our precedent prohibits legislatures from\nrequiring that juvenile murderers be sentenced to life\nwithout parole.

Of these categorical propor-\ntionality cases, the Court places particular emphasis on\nRoper v. Simmons, 543 U. S. 551 (2005), and Graham v.\nFlorida, 560 U. S. ___ (2010). In Roper, the Court held\nthat the Constitution prohibits the execution of an offender\nwho was under 18 at the time of his offense. 543 U. S.,\nat 578. The Roper Court looked to, among other things, its\nown sense of parental intuition and \u201cscientific and socio-\nlogical studies\u201d to conclude that offenders under the age of\n18 \u201ccannot with reliability be classified among the worst\noffenders.\u201d Id., at 569. In Graham, the Court relied on\nsimilar considerations to conclude that the Constitution\nprohibits a life-without-parole sentence for a nonhomicide\noffender who was under the age of 18 at the time of his\noffense. 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 24).\n   The Court now concludes that mandatory life-without-\nparole sentences for duly convicted juvenile murderers\n\u201ccontraven[e] Graham\u2019s (and also Roper\u2019s) foundational\nprinciple: that imposition of a State\u2019s most severe penal-\nties on juvenile offenders cannot proceed as though they\nwere not children.\u201d Ante, at 11\u201312. But neither Roper nor\nGraham held that specific procedural rules are required\nfor sentencing juvenile homicide offenders. And, the logic\nof those cases should not be extended to create such a\nrequirement.\n   The Eighth Amendment, made applicable to the States\nby the Fourteenth Amendment, provides that: \u201cExcessive\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 I join THE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2019s opinion because it accurately explains\n\nthat, even accepting the Court\u2019s precedents, the Court\u2019s holding in\ntoday\u2019s cases is unsupportable.\n\f                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                     3\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nbail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed,\nnor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\u201d As I have\npreviously explained, \u201cthe Cruel and Unusual Punish-\nments Clause was originally understood as prohibiting\ntorturous methods of punishment\u2014specifically methods\nakin to those that had been considered cruel and unusual\nat the time the Bill of Rights was adopted.\u201d Graham,\nsupra, at ___ (dissenting opinion) (slip op., at 3) (internal\nquotation marks and citations omitted).2 The clause does\nnot contain a \u201cproportionality principle.\u201d Ewing v. Cali-\nfornia, 538 U. S. 11, 32 (2003) (THOMAS, J., concurring in\njudgment); see generally Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U. S.\n957, 975\u2013985 (1991) (opinion of SCALIA, J.). In short, it\ndoes not authorize courts to invalidate any punishment\nthey deem disproportionate to the severity of the crime\nor to a particular class of offenders. Instead, the clause\n\u201cleaves the unavoidably moral question of who \u2018deserves\u2019 a\nparticular nonprohibited method of punishment to the\njudgment of the legislatures that authorize the penalty.\u201d\nGraham, supra, at ___ (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (slip op.,\nat 5).\n   The legislatures of Arkansas and Alabama, like those of\n27 other jurisdictions, ante, at 19\u201320, have determined\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Neither the Court nor petitioners argue that petitioners\u2019 sentences\n\nwould have been among \u201cthe \u2018modes or acts of punishment that had\nbeen considered cruel and unusual at the time that the Bill of Rights\nwas adopted.\u2019 \u201d Graham, 560 U. S., at ___ (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (slip\nop., at 10, n. 3) (quoting Ford v. Wainwright, 477 U. S. 399, 405 (1986)).\nNor could they. Petitioners were 14 years old at the time they commit-\nted their crimes. When the Bill of Rights was ratified, 14-year-olds\nwere subject to trial and punishment as adult offenders. See Roper v.\nSimmons, 543 U. S. 551, 609, n. 1 (2005) (SCALIA, J., dissenting).\nFurther, mandatory death sentences were common at that time. See\nHarmelin v. Michigan, 501 U. S. 957, 994\u2013995 (1991). It is therefore\nimplausible that a 14-year-old\u2019s mandatory prison sentence\u2014of any\nlength, with or without parole\u2014would have been viewed as cruel and\nunusual.\n\f4                   MILLER v. ALABAMA\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nthat all offenders convicted of specified homicide offenses,\nwhether juveniles or not, deserve a sentence of life in\nprison without the possibility of parole. Nothing in our\nConstitution authorizes this Court to supplant that choice.\n                             II\n   To invalidate mandatory life-without-parole sentences\nfor juveniles, the Court also relies on its cases \u201cprohib-\nit[ing] mandatory imposition of capital punishment.\u201d\nAnte, at 7. The Court reasons that, because Graham\ncompared juvenile life-without-parole sentences to the\ndeath penalty, the \u201cdistinctive set of legal rules\u201d that this\nCourt has imposed in the capital punishment context,\nincluding the requirement of individualized sentencing, is\n\u201crelevant\u201d here. Ante, at 12\u201313. But even accepting an\nanalogy between capital and juvenile life-without-parole\nsentences, this Court\u2019s cases prohibiting mandatory capi-\ntal sentencing schemes have no basis in the original un-\nderstanding of the Eighth Amendment, and, thus, cannot\njustify a prohibition of sentencing schemes that mandate\nlife-without-parole sentences for juveniles.\n                               A\n   In a line of cases following Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S.\n238 (1972) (per curiam), this Court prohibited the manda-\ntory imposition of the death penalty. See Woodson v.\nNorth Carolina, 428 U. S. 280 (1976) (plurality opinion);\nRoberts v. Louisiana, 428 U. S. 325 (1976) (same); Sumner\nv. Shuman, 483 U. S. 66 (1987). Furman first announced\nthe principle that States may not permit sentencers to\nexercise unguided discretion in imposing the death pen-\nalty. See generally 408 U. S. 238. In response to Furman,\nmany States passed new laws that made the death pen-\nalty mandatory following conviction of specified crimes,\nthereby eliminating the offending discretion. See Gregg\nv. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 180\u2013181 (1976) (joint opinion\n\f                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                   5\n\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nof Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.). The Court invali-\ndated those statutes in Woodson, Roberts, and Sumner.\nThe Court reasoned that mandatory capital sentencing\nschemes were problematic, because they failed \u201cto allow\nthe particularized consideration\u201d of \u201crelevant facets of the\ncharacter and record of the individual offender or the\ncircumstances of the particular offense.\u201d Woodson, supra,\nat 303\u2013304 (plurality opinion).3\n   In my view, Woodson and its progeny were wrongly\ndecided. As discussed above, the Cruel and Unusual\nPunishments Clause, as originally understood, prohibits\n\u201ctorturous methods of punishment.\u201d See Graham, 560\nU. S., at ___ (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 3) (inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted). It is not concerned with\nwhether a particular lawful method of punishment\u2014\nwhether capital or noncapital\u2014is imposed pursuant to a\nmandatory or discretionary sentencing regime. See Gard-\nner v. Florida, 430 U. S. 349, 371 (1977) (Rehnquist, J.,\ndissenting) (\u201cThe prohibition of the Eighth Amendment\nrelates to the character of the punishment, and not to the\nprocess by which it is imposed\u201d). In fact, \u201c[i]n the early\ndays of the Republic,\u201d each crime generally had a defined\npunishment \u201cprescribed with specificity by the legisla-\nture.\u201d United States v. Grayson, 438 U. S. 41, 45 (1978).\nCapital sentences, to which the Court analogizes, were\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The Court later extended Woodson, requiring that capital defend-\n\nants be permitted to present, and sentencers in capital cases be permit-\nted to consider, any relevant mitigating evidence, including the age of\nthe defendant. See, e.g., Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586, 597\u2013608 (1978)\n(plurality opinion); Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104, 110\u2013112\n(1982); Skipper v. South Carolina, 476 U. S. 1, 4\u20135 (1986); Johnson v.\nTexas, 509 U. S. 350, 361\u2013368 (1993). Whatever the validity of the\nrequirement that sentencers be permitted to consider all mitigating\nevidence when deciding whether to impose a nonmandatory capital\nsentence, the Court certainly was wrong to prohibit mandatory capital\nsentences. See Graham v. Collins, 506 U. S. 461, 488\u2013500 (1993)\n(THOMAS, J., concurring).\n\f6                   MILLER v. ALABAMA\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ntreated no differently. \u201c[M]andatory death sentences\nabounded in our first Penal Code\u201d and were \u201ccommon in\nthe several States\u2014both at the time of the founding and\nthroughout the 19th century.\u201d Harmelin, 501 U. S., at\n994\u2013995; see also Woodson, supra, at 289 (plurality opin-\nion) (\u201cAt the time the Eighth Amendment was adopted\nin 1791, the States uniformly followed the common-law\npractice of making death the exclusive and mandatory\nsentence for certain specified offenses\u201d). Accordingly, the\nidea that the mandatory imposition of an otherwise-\nconstitutional sentence renders that sentence cruel and\nunusual finds \u201cno support in the text and history of the\nEighth Amendment.\u201d Harmelin, supra, at 994.\n   Moreover, mandatory death penalty schemes were \u201ca\nperfectly reasonable legislative response to the concerns\nexpressed in Furman\u201d regarding unguided sentencing\ndiscretion, in that they \u201celiminat[ed] explicit jury discre-\ntion and treat[ed] all defendants equally.\u201d Graham v.\nCollins, 506 U. S. 461, 487 (1993) (THOMAS, J., concur-\nring). And, as Justice White explained more than 30 years\nago, \u201ca State is not constitutionally forbidden to provide\nthat the commission of certain crimes conclusively estab-\nlishes that a criminal\u2019s character is such that he deserves\ndeath.\u201d Roberts, supra, at 358 (dissenting opinion). Thus,\nthere is no basis for concluding that a mandatory capi-\ntal sentencing scheme is unconstitutional. Because the\nCourt\u2019s cases requiring individualized sentencing in the\ncapital context are wrongly decided, they cannot serve as a\nvalid foundation for the novel rule regarding mandatory\nlife-without-parole sentences for juveniles that the Court\nannounces today.\n                             B\n   In any event, this Court has already declined to extend\nits individualized-sentencing rule beyond the death pen-\nalty context. In Harmelin, the defendant was convicted of\n\f                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           7\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\npossessing a large quantity of drugs. 501 U. S., at 961\n(opinion of SCALIA, J.). In accordance with Michigan\nlaw, he was sentenced to a mandatory term of life in prison\nwithout the possibility of parole. Ibid. Citing the same\nline of death penalty precedents on which the Court relies\ntoday, the defendant argued that his sentence, due to its\nmandatory nature, violated the Cruel and Unusual Pun-\nishments Clause. Id., at 994\u2013995 (opinion of the Court).\n   The Court rejected that argument, explaining that\n\u201c[t]here can be no serious contention . . . that a sentence\nwhich is not otherwise cruel and unusual becomes so sim-\nply because it is \u2018mandatory.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 995. In so doing,\nthe Court refused to analogize to its death penalty cases.\nThe Court noted that those cases had \u201crepeatedly suggested\nthat there is no comparable [individualized-sentencing]\nrequirement outside the capital context, because of the\nqualitative difference between death and all other penal-\nties.\u201d Ibid. The Court observed that, \u201ceven where the\ndifference\u201d between a sentence of life without parole and\nother sentences of imprisonment \u201cis the greatest,\u201d such\na sentence \u201ccannot be compared with death.\u201d Id., at 996.\nTherefore, the Court concluded that the line of cases re-\nquiring individualized sentencing had been drawn at cap-\nital cases, and that there was \u201cno basis for extending it\nfurther.\u201d Ibid.\n   Harmelin\u2019s reasoning logically extends to these cases.\nObviously, the younger the defendant, \u201cthe great[er]\u201d the\ndifference between a sentence of life without parole and\nother terms of imprisonment. Ibid. But under Harmelin\u2019s\nrationale, the defendant\u2019s age is immaterial to the Eighth\nAmendment analysis. Thus, the result in today\u2019s cases\nshould be the same as that in Harmelin. Petitioners, like\nthe defendant in Harmelin, were not sentenced to death.\nAccordingly, this Court\u2019s cases \u201ccreating and clarifying the\nindividualized capital sentencing doctrine\u201d do not apply.\nId., at 995 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\f8                        MILLER v. ALABAMA\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n  Nothing about our Constitution, or about the qualitative\ndifference between any term of imprisonment and death,\nhas changed since Harmelin was decided 21 years ago.\nWhat has changed (or, better yet, \u201cevolved\u201d) is this Court\u2019s\never-expanding line of categorical proportionality cases.\nThe Court now uses Roper and Graham to jettison Har-\nmelin\u2019s clear distinction between capital and noncapital\ncases and to apply the former to noncapital juvenile of-\nfenders.4 The Court\u2019s decision to do so is even less sup-\nportable than the precedents used to reach it.\n                             III\n   As THE CHIEF JUSTICE notes, ante, at 8\u20139 (dissenting\nopinion), the Court lays the groundwork for future incur-\nsions on the States\u2019 authority to sentence criminals. In its\ncategorical proportionality cases, the Court has considered\n\u201c \u2018objective indicia of society\u2019s standards, as expressed\nin legislative enactments and state practice\u2019 to determine\nwhether there is a national consensus against the sentenc-\ning practice at issue.\u201d Graham, 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 10) (quoting Roper, 543 U. S., at 563). In Graham, for\nexample, the Court looked to \u201c[a]ctual sentencing prac-\ntices\u201d to conclude that there was a national consensus\nagainst life-without-parole sentences for juvenile nonhom-\nicide offenders. 560 U.

Id., at 595\u2013596. In Enmund, where the\nCourt held that the Eighth Amendment forbids capital\npunishment for ordinary felony murder, both federal law\nand the law of 28 of the 36 States that authorized the\ndeath penalty at the time rejected that punishment. 458\nU. S., at 789.\n   While the tally in these early cases may be character\u00ad\nized as evidence of a national consensus, the evidence\nbecame weaker and weaker in later cases. In Atkins,\nwhich held that low-IQ defendants may not be sentenced\nto death, the Court found an anti\u2013death-penalty consen\u00ad\nsus even though more than half of the States that allowed\ncapital punishment permitted the practice. See 536 U. S.,\nat 342 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (observing that less than\nhalf of the 38 States that permit capital punishment\nhave enacted legislation barring execution of the mentally\nretarded). The Court attempted to get around this prob\u00ad\nlem by noting that there was a pronounced trend against\nthis punishment. See id., at 313\u2013315 (listing 18 States\nthat had amended their laws since 1986 to prohibit the\nexecution of mentally retarded persons).\n   The importance of trend evidence, however, was not\nlong lived. In Roper, which outlawed capital punishment\nfor defendants between the ages of 16 and 18, the lineup of\nthe States was the same as in Atkins, but the trend in\nfavor of abolition\u2014five States during the past 15 years\u2014\nwas less impressive.

See id., at 566\n(\u201cAny difference between this case and Atkins with respect\nto the pace of abolition is thus counterbalanced by the\nconsistent direction of the change\u201d).\n   In Kennedy v.

See 554 U. S., at 433 (explaining that,\nalthough \u201cthe total number of States to have made child\nrape a capital offense . . . is six,\u201d \u201c[t]his is not an indication\nof a trend or change in direction comparable to the one\nsupported by data in Roper\u201d). The Court felt no need to\nsee whether this trend developed further\u2014perhaps be\u00ad\ncause true moral evolution can lead in only one direction.\nAnd despite the argument that the rape of a young child\nmay involve greater depravity than some murders, the\nCourt proclaimed that homicide is categorically different\nfrom all (or maybe almost all) other offenses. See id.,\nat 438 (stating that nonhomicide crimes, including child\nrape, \u201cmay be devastating in their harm . . . but in terms\nof moral depravity and of the injury to the person and\nto the public, they cannot be compared to murder in their\nseverity and irrevocability\u201d (internal quotation marks\nand citation omitted)). As the Court had previously put\nit, \u201cdeath is different.\u201d Ford, supra, at 411 (plurality\nopinion).\n   Two years after Kennedy, in Graham v. Florida, any\npretense of heeding a legislative consensus was discarded.\nIn Graham, federal law and the law of 37 States and the\nDistrict of Columbia permitted a minor to be sentenced to\nlife imprisonment without parole for nonhomicide crimes,\nbut despite this unmistakable evidence of a national con\u00ad\nsensus, the Court held that the practice violates the\nEighth Amendment. See 560 U. S., at ___ (THOMAS, J.,\ndissenting) (slip op., at 1\u20133). The Court, however, drew a\ndistinction between minors who murder and minors who\ncommit other heinous offenses, so at least in that sense\nthe principle that death is different lived on.\n   Today, that principle is entirely put to rest, for here we\n\f                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                   5\n\n                         ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nare concerned with the imposition of a term of imprison\u00ad\nment on offenders who kill. The two (carefully selected)\ncases before us concern very young defendants, and de\u00ad\nspite the brutality and evident depravity exhibited by at\nleast one of the petitioners, it is hard not to feel sympathy\nfor a 14-year-old sentenced to life without the possibility of\nrelease. But no one should be confused by the particulars\nof the two cases before us. The category of murderers that\nthe Court delicately calls \u201cchildren\u201d (murderers under the\nage of 18) consists overwhelmingly of young men who are\nfast approaching the legal age of adulthood. Evan Miller\nand Kuntrell Jackson are anomalies; much more typical\nare murderers like Donald Roper, who committed a brutal\nthrill-killing just nine months shy of his 18th birthday.\nRoper, 543 U. S., at 556.\n   Seventeen-year-olds commit a significant number of\nmurders every year,1 and some of these crimes are incred\u00ad\nibly brutal. Many of these murderers are at least as ma\u00ad\nture as the average 18-year-old. See Thompson, 487 U. S.,\nat 854 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in judgment) (noting that\nmaturity may \u201cvary widely among different individuals of\nthe same age\u201d). Congress and the legislatures of 43 States\nhave concluded that at least some of these murderers\nshould be sentenced to prison without parole, and 28\nStates and the Federal Government have decided that for\nsome of these offenders life without parole should be man\u00ad\ndatory. See Ante, at 20\u201321, and nn. 9\u201310. The majority of\nthis Court now overrules these legislative judgments.2\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Between  2002 and 2010, 17-year-olds committed an average com\u00ad\nbined total of 424 murders and nonnegligent homicides per year. See\nDept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, \u00a74, Arrests, Age of per\u00ad\nsons arrested (Table 4.7).\n  2 As the Court noted in Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361, 366\n\n(1989), Congress passed the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 to eliminate\ndiscretionary sentencing and parole because it concluded that these\npractices had led to gross abuses. The Senate Report for the 1984 bill\n\f6                       MILLER v. ALABAMA\n\n                         ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n  It is true that, at least for now, the Court apparently\npermits a trial judge to make an individualized decision\nthat a particular minor convicted of murder should be\nsentenced to life without parole, but do not expect this\npossibility to last very long. The majority goes out of its\nway to express the view that the imposition of a sentence\nof life without parole on a \u201cchild\u201d (i.e., a murderer under\nthe age of 18) should be uncommon. Having held in Gra-\nham that a trial judge with discretionary sentencing\nauthority may not impose a sentence of life without parole\non a minor who has committed a nonhomicide offense, the\nJustices in the majority may soon extend that holding to\nminors who commit murder. We will see.\n  What today\u2019s decision shows is that our Eighth Amend\u00ad\nment cases are no longer tied to any objective indicia of\nsociety\u2019s standards. Our Eighth Amendment case law is\nnow entirely inward looking. After entirely disregarding\nobjective indicia of our society\u2019s standards in Graham, the\nCourt now extrapolates from Graham. Future cases may\nextrapolate from today\u2019s holding, and this process may\ncontinue until the majority brings sentencing practices\ninto line with whatever the majority views as truly\nevolved standards of decency.\n  The Eighth Amendment imposes certain limits on the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nrejected what it called the \u201coutmoded rehabilitation model\u201d for federal\ncriminal sentencing. S. Rep. No. 98\u2013225, p. 38 (1983). According to\nthe Report, \u201calmost everyone involved in the criminal justice system now\ndoubts that rehabilitation can be induced reliably in a prison setting,\nand it is now quite certain that no one can really detect whether or\nwhen a prisoner is rehabilitated.\u201d Ibid. The Report also \u201cobserved that\nthe indeterminate-sentencing system had two \u2018unjustifi[ed] and \u2018shame\u00ad\nful\u2019 consequences. The first was the great variation among sentences\nimposed by different judges upon similarly situated offenders. The\nsecond was uncertainty as to the time the offender would spend in\nprison. Each was a serious impediment to an evenhanded and effective\noperation of the criminal justice system.\u201d Mistretta, supra, at 366\n(quoting S. Rep. No. 98\u2013225, at 38, 65 (citation omitted)).\n\f                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           7\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nsentences that may be imposed in criminal cases, but for\nthe most part it leaves questions of sentencing policy to be\ndetermined by Congress and the state legislatures\u2014and\nwith good reason. Determining the length of imprison\u00ad\nment that is appropriate for a particular offense and a\nparticular offender inevitably involves a balancing of in\u00ad\nterests. If imprisonment does nothing else, it removes\nthe criminal from the general population and prevents\nhim from committing additional crimes in the outside\nworld. When a legislature prescribes that a category of\nkillers must be sentenced to life imprisonment, the legisla\u00ad\nture, which presumably reflects the views of the elec\u00ad\ntorate, is taking the position that the risk that these\noffenders will kill again outweighs any countervailing\nconsideration, including reduced culpability due to imma\u00ad\nturity or the possibility of rehabilitation. When the major\u00ad\nity of this Court countermands that democratic decision,\nwhat the majority is saying is that members of society\nmust be exposed to the risk that these convicted murder\u00ad\ners, if released from custody, will murder again.\n   Unless our cases change course, we will continue to\nmarch toward some vision of evolutionary culmination\nthat the Court has not yet disclosed. The Constitution\ndoes not authorize us to take the country on this journey.\n\f"
