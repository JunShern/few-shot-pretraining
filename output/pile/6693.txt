    "text": "Monday, August 23, 2010\n\nThe One Tie You Need\n\nWhether you rock with a pared down wardrobe or are the kind of guy who likes to have 5 of everything, let me humbly recommend the one tie you absolutely need - a J. Press navy knit. Neckwear doesn't get any better. End of story. It's style for the ages - timeless, season-less, all occasions, etc. At 3\" it's the perfect width and ties the perfect four-in-hand knot. The beauty of this tie is how squarely it falls into everyone's sweet spot. No matter what your personal aesthetic may be, this tie will not only transition in with no problem, but quickly become your go-to piece of neckwear. With this very post in mind, I made sure to head over to the J. Press store in NYC on Friday to check out their selection. After not finding a single navy knit I asked a salesman what the deal was. Apparently, early that morning a woman had come to J. Press and asked how many navy knits were currently in stock. After a salesman rounded up all 14 from both the floor and stockroom, the woman proceeded to buy every last one. She mentioned that her boyfriend only wore navy knits and that he got more compliments on his J. Press number than any other. $1,113 (before New York state sales tax) was spent and she left the store as quickly as she had come in. This post is obviously not for that guy - he already knows what's up.\n\nAnon @11:05- Uniqlo makes decent knits for the price, but you cannot compare them to J. Press' offerings in terms of quality or even style. The biggest issue for me, with most knit ties regardless of where they are from, is the width. Uniqlo's options, like 90% of knit ties on the market, are too skinny. 3\" on up or bust...pause.\n\nThe Press navy blue knit is nice but for my money I prefer the Paul Stuart. A bit more body and \"scrunch.\" They're about 65 bucks in PS so maybe 15 bucks more expensive than Press but it's going to last a long time."
