Participants can come alone without feeling out of place; alternatively it is something that women who like to go out in groups can do together.\n\nBecause the matching itself happens after the event, people do not feel pressured to select or reject each other in person.\n\nSpeed dating is a formalized matchmaking process of dating system whose purpose is to encourage people to meet a large number of new people.\n\nIts origins are credited to Rabbi Yaacov Deyo of Aish Ha Torah, originally as a way to help Jewish singles meet and marry.\n\nSpeed dating, as two separate words, is often used as a generic term for similar events.Contact information cannot be traded during the initial meeting, in order to reduce pressure to accept or reject a suitor to his or her face.There are many speed dating events now in the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States.There have been several studies of the round-robin dating systems themselves, as well as studies of interpersonal attraction that are relevant to these events.Other studies found speed-dating data useful as a way to observe individual choices among random participants.\n\nOne of Good Luck Chuck While playing seven minutes in heaven at a party in 1985, 10-year-old Charles \"Chuck\" Logan (Connor Price) refuses to kiss a goth girl named Anisha (Sasha Pieterse) who attempts to have sex with him.\n\nIf you could see anyone perform live who would it be?
