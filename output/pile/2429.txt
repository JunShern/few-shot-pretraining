Since the day we arrived there was no water at all, let alone hot water. We had to complaint every day. The food had no varaity at all. Table clothes we always found dirty. Wi-Fi very poor connection it was difficult to contact with family. I dont think i will visit this place anymore. All the stars where removed, because the building is as old as 1980's. It hasn't been reconstructed since then. Very very very disopoined.\n\nDate of stay: August 2017\n\nTrip type: Travelled with friends\n\nAsk Reading An E about Hotel Lydia's Beach\n\n5 Thank Reading An E\n\nThis review is the subjective opinion of a TripAdvisor member and not of TripAdvisor LLC\n\nWe stayed at the hotel on a package deal from an agency for 4 nights.Where do i start?The sheets and towels were only changed once in 5 days and even then because we insisted and specifially asked at the reception.The small face towel in the bathroom was in poor shape from the start and was never changed.We even left it on the ground on purpose but they never changed it.Food wise, not a lot of variety and very poor quality. Pool was not clean, smelly, and with dead insects floating around.The only good thing there was the hotel staff which was always willing to help and with a very positive attitude.I honestly dont know where this hotel gets the 4 stars from..\n\nDate of stay: July 2017\n\nTrip type: Travelled as a couple\n\nAsk enfrid i about Hotel Lydia's Beach\n\n9 Thank enfrid i\n\nThis review is the subjective opinion of a TripAdvisor member and not of TripAdvisor LLC\n\nThe interior design was awful, like 70's. Faucet didn't work well and Good wasn't good at all and food selection was so small. At the evening when I tried to sleep, I felt sick because of that food. Also beds were so hard. So I stay awake almost all night. I cried. Soundproofing didn't work properly. What a nightmare! I don't recommend.\n\nDate of stay: July 2017\n\nAsk Odyssey682973 about Hotel Lydia's Beach\n\n4 Thank Odyssey682973\n\nThis review is the subjective opinion of a TripAdvisor member and not of TripAdvisor LLC\n\nLydia Hotel Beach, is the greate greate hotel, with all the tipe of places, with the gardem, pool, the beach bar, with the nice intertaiment things in the hotel area.
