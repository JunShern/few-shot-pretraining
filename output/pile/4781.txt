Onlookers snapped photos as an adult held the child up for a \u201ckeg stand,\u201d where a person is held upside down and drinks as much beer as he can.\n\nAccording to thedirty.com, an ASU student, who was appalled, sent the picture in.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t see the joke in it at all,\u201d says website creator Nik Richie. \u201cPeople are really looking at this saying, even if it was a joke it is just poor taste and it is terrible parenting.\u201d\n\nRichie says the photo was taken while tailgating outside the stadium before Saturday\u2019s game.\n\n\u201cIf you are an ASU alumni, I know this is a party school and people look at ASU like this is what you do. It is fun and games. It is not.\u201d\n\nIf this was intended to be joke, not many people are laughing now. ASU Police are investigating. [Emphasis added]\n\nHowever there are also those who are taking the photo with a grain of salt\u2013 and a bit more humor.\n\nDisagreeing with the woman who said \u201cthey should be jailed,\u201d one commenter wrote on thedirty.com: \u201cI doubt they actually gave the kid beer\u2026Just a funny photo opp. Everyone needs to stop being so serious!\u201d\n\nAnother agreed, adding: \u201cI doubt everyone around would be laughing if it was actually happening\u2026Come on, people.\u201d\n\nWhat do you think? Is the \u201cbaby keg stand\u201d photo an innocent joke, or over the line either way?"
