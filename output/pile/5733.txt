    "text": "Search form\n\nMises Daily\n\nGood Enough for Me\n\nTime and again, critics of the free market label certain choices of consumers \"irrational.\" The Center for Science as a Public Nuisance\u2026 sorry, I mean the Center for Science in the Public Interest...recently called for a junk-food tax, the proceeds of which would fund, \"frequent, hard-hitting messages [that] can change Americans' behavior.\"\n\nIf I'm eating poorly, CPSI feels that it is a good idea for money forcibly extracted from me to be used to badger me about\u2026 eating better!\n\nYou see,Michael F.\nJacobson, Executive Director of the lobbying organization, knows what other Americans should eat\u2014what is healthiest for them.\nIt is inconceivable to him that others might choose to value a different end more highly\u2014such as the enjoyment of food, or minimizing the time spent worrying about food.\n\nSimilarly, a very bright man I know recently asked me why people buy athletic shoes endorsed by famous athletes.\n\"Do they think,\" he wondered, \"the fact that Michael Jordan endorsed these shoes will make them play basketball any better?\"\n\nSome free-market economists worry about \"problems\" like this.\nIf consumers are choosing a shoe based on an advertising campaign featuring a certain athlete, or people are eating the \"wrong\" foods, it will give ammunition to anti-market thinkers such as John Kenneth Galbraith, who feel the consumers are simple dupes in the hand of advertisers.\n\nThese economistsspend a great deal of time attempting to show that consumers' choices are \"rational.\" One line taken is to insist that these campaigns are educating the consumers, who after a learning process chose their Michael Jordan shoes.\n\nThis view is best refuted not by arguing that consumers are \"learning\" when they choose Michael Jordan sneakers over Karl Malone sneakers, or over generic brands that are exactly the same (sans name) as Michael Jordan sneakers.\nFantasy is unlikely to be a successful technique for defending the market.\n\nInstead, proponents of freedom should answer with a resounding \"So what?\" So, consumers don't always choose their sneakers based on the criteria that Galbraith feels they should be using\u2014so what?\nThey still choose, and they choose based on the criteria that are important to them.\nIn fact, what many people are buying when they buy, for instance, a sneaker, is an element of an identity.\n\nConsumers may have, as their chosen end, a particular image of themselves in mind.\nPart of that image may involve the personal style of some celebrity, such as Jordan.\nThey buy a certain product not on its technical merits but on its ability to move them closer to that image.\nWhy should Galbraith, or anyone else, have any say in this process?\n\nThe key to understanding this issue is to realize, with Mises, that there is no objective means by which to judge some ends as being better than others are.\nIn Theory and History he says:\n\nJudgments of value are voluntaristic.\nThey express feelings, tastes, or preferences of the individual who utters them.\nWith regard to them there cannot be any question of truth or falsity.\nThey are ultimate and not subject to any proof or evidence.\n\nThis has not stopped countless philosophers, economists, \"social scientists,\" and others from attempting such proofs.\nNo one has ever succeeded.\n\nAmong libertarians, this urge has been especially strong among the followers of Ayn Rand.\nShe was, however, simply one in a long line of thinkers who \"demonstrated\" that his or her value system was the correct one and could be arrived at by pure ratiocination.\nNot one of them, however, has ever been able to get even a large minority of mankind to follow their system.\n\nSuch \"demonstrations\" are easily refuted by simply saying, \"I disagree.\" If the disagreeable person does not accept the initial assumption of ends that the value system presupposes, the argument has reached a standstill from which there is no way, by reasoning alone, to move either party.\nThis has been the terminus of all such attempts to prove a system of values.\n\nThe effort to create an objective system of libertarian ethics that is universally valid founders on some people\u2019s refusal to accept human freedom as an ultimate end.\nTo those who refuse, instead choosing, perhaps, equality, or the fate of the South African giant sea slug, there is nothing more to say.\n\nFrom the opposite perspective, University of Illinois professor Stanley Fishchallenges the classical liberal world view by arguing that its tolerance only extends to other tolerant views, and that there is no ultimate, objective basis for labeling it superior.\n\nThat is true.\nTo have a complete picture of the truth, however, we need to add thatclassical liberalism\nis the only view that makes possible the worldwide cooperation of all people under the division of labor, and their continually increasing prosperity.\nClassical liberalism does not deny the possibility that some system of revealed ethics is ultimately correct.\nIt merely asserts that mankind has never reached a general consensus on this issue, and that it is unlikely that it ever will.\n\nTo someone who aims for the impoverishment or annihilation of mankind there is no objective argument against their attempt to implement a worldwide socialist or theocratic state.\nBut for most of us, this pragmatic aspect of the classical liberal world-view is good enough.\n\nFollow Mises
