Which quickly turned into a simple build with a regular weapon, as Hyaon\u2019s Fury is actually complete shit and is outclassed by any 10c rapier with proper stats.\n\nThat\u2019s where my idea of using Raider also comes from (for a ridiculous amount of frenzy charges which would synergize even better with Hyaon\u2019s), and I decided to stick with it even with another sword as I like having a lot of frenzy charges.\n\n\n\nIn any case, I wanted to make a build with a niche skill (and lightning strike is pretty niche, as far as i can tell), and this is what I came up with. It doesn\u2019t shine by its boss-killing capabilities, but it\u2019s a nice little build using a fun niche skill that can perfectly clear most content, and so is good as a league starter option.\n\n\n\nIf I missed anything, my formatting isn't right, or anything else, do tell me. This is my first guide (as you can probably tell), so I'm prone to making mistakes.\n\n\n\nEnjoy the read !\n\n\n\n\n\nPros & Cons\n\n\n\n+ High AoE damage\n\n+ Good on a budget, can be pushed further with some investment\n\n+ Good league-starter, the only item you really need is Lycosidae\n\n+ High movement speed thanks to Leap Slam and 8+ frenzy charges\n\n+ Combines dodge, evasion and block for damage mitigation\n\n+ Very high lightning penetration (94% !)\n\n+ Can run phys reflect, curse immune maps easily\n\n+ Can run maps up to T15 without any issues\n\n+ Not the best at uber lab (izaro hits hard) but you can run it with relative ease\n\n+ Excels in open layouts\n\n\n\n\n\n- Squishy by nature as a Ranger\n\n- Can\u2019t run ele reflect\n\n- Can run no leech maps but it requires some care\n\n- T16 and Shaper might prove difficult, this is not a bosskiller build.\n\n- Can sometimes be difficult to use in tight layouts or in the presence of obstacles\n\n- Probably not HC viable\n\n\n\n\n\nGear\n\n\n\nMy Gear and Gear Breakdown\n\nMy Gear (3.3 ISC)\n\nHelmet\n\nAny rare helmet will do. The best enchantment you can get is \"Lightning Strike Pierces 3 Additional Targets\", saving you a few points on your skill tree to spend elsewhere, as Pierce is essential and will drastically improve your AoE capabilities. I did not find a good enough helmet with that enchantment, sadly. But it's definitely the best one available. 40% Lightning Strike damage is not too shabby, but it's definitely not as good as the pierce enchantment.\n\n\n\nAlternatives : Starkonja. If you can manage the resists on a build that already has a fair share of uniques, go for it. Any rare helmet will do.

I use Shroud of the Lightless for an easy 6-link (Elemental Penetration allows me to remove Lightning Penetration) and a pretty good HP bonus since this build uses a lot of abyss jewels. The spell Shade Form is also nice, making you immune to physical damage and giving you phasing for a few seconds, but as it has an internal cooldown of 45 seconds, don't count on it too much.\n\n\n\nHowever, there are a few alternatives, such as a simple Belly of the Beast, Queen of the Forest (if you really want to go fast), or a rare Zodiac Leather.\n\nWe have several options here.

It has a low amount of life (up to 50), but the \"hits can't be evaded\" mod is highly invaluable and saves us from investing any resources into accuracy.\n\n\n\nIt being a rather expensive shield at the moment, as a league starter alternative you can get Lioneye's Remorse which will bulk you up a bit with its big amount of HP. You might need to find accuracy somewhere else, though, either in your tree (we have access to a bunch of accuracy nodes) or on your jewelry. Lycosidae.

It gives you increased movement speed per frenzy charge (going up to 45% at 9 charges), and 2% chance to dodge attacks per frenzy charge. All in all, an excellent and cheap pair of boots for us.\n\n\n\nIf you're playing in Standard, the best item is Darkray Vectors with a +1 Frenzy Charges corrupted implicit. Since 3.3, that corruption has been moved to Gloves, so you cannot get it in Incursion.\n\n\n\nIf you do not like Darkray Vectors (shame on you), you can use Atziri's Step for more dodge, or regular Rare boots.\n\n\n\nImportant stats on a rare are :\n\nBest : HP, resistances\n\nGood : Movement speed Darkray Vectors are the obvious choice for a build oriented towards Frenzy Charges.

With good jewels, I can get a very good amount of HP and damage.\n\nBe aware though, you need good jewels to use Darkness Enthroned, and I don't think it's that worth it if you do not use Shroud of the Lightless, unless you have absolutely godtier jewels (aka, a lot better than mine)\n\n\n\nStats to look out for on a rare are :\n\nBest : HP, resistances, Elemental Damage with Attack Skills\n\nGood : Flask duration, flask charges gained, strength (high rolls, 40+ can be interesting for the hp bonus and less constraints for gems)\n\nDecent : HP gained from life flasks, -% flask charges used Here is where it gets interesting.Normally, the best base is a rare Stygian Vise with good rolls, or, if you can't afford that, a Leather Belt with good rolls.However, since I switched to Shroud of the Lightless, I decided to use Darkness Enthroned to use 2 abyss jewels, which are boosted by 50% by the belt.

This tends to get less expensive, as rings that are both good in offense and defense are going to be extremely expensive.\n\n\n\nStats to look out for (defensive) :\n\nBest : HP, resists (120+ total)\n\nGood : Accuracy (if you are not using Lycosidae, if you are, ignore accuracy completely)\n\nDecent : Attributes (as always, str gives us 1 hp per 2 str, int means fulfilling gem requirements, dex gives us evasion only, not very interesting)\n\n\n\nStats to look out for (offensive) :\n\nBest : HP, Elemental Damage with Attack Skills, Added Lightning Damage to Attacks\n\nGood : Lightning Damage\n\nDecent : Attack Speed (minimal gain, don't make this a priority) Any rare rings will do.I believe that The Taming can work well with this build, but I haven't tested it.The best base for your rings is Opal Ring, obviously, but these can get prohibitively expensive.I like to use a ring solely focused on defense (to cap my resistances) and another one more focused on damage.

As a suffix, aim for Staunching or Heat to remove bleed or freeze (I prefer staunching).\n\nDiamond Flask for more crit. Best mods are Experimenter's (more duration) and Heat/Staunching (whatever you don't have on your hp flask)\n\nSulphur flask for more damage. Best mods are Experimenter's (more duration) and Warding (curses are annoying). You can replace this with a Jade Flask or a Basalt Flask for more damage mitigation.\n\nThe Wise Oak is very important. Try to get a flask with max rolls, as this will improve your dps quite a bit. You also require your uncapped lightning resistance to be the highest for it to be useful. Balanced resistances are the best for defensive purposes, but for offensive purposes all you need is for your lightning resistance to be the highest.\n\nAtziri's Promise. An amazing DPS flask. Try to get the highest roll on the elemental to chaos conversion, as it's much more important than the physical one. You can mostly ignore the physical conversion, as you barely deal any physical damage to begin with.\n\n\n\nI think Vessel of Vinktar could be used, but honestly, that flask is shitty. I don't want to add Shock to my weaknesses on an already kinda squishy build. Screw that. If you like to suffer, feel free to replace Sulphur flask with it.

Regular jewels are interesting enough, but Abyss Jewels are the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me.\n\nYou are going to want, most of all, Murderous Eye Jewels, as they can roll high damage for sword attacks. Searching Eye Jewels are also ok, but can't roll sword attack mods.\n\n\n\nStats to look out for :\n\nBest : HP, Added Lightning Damage to Attacks, Added Lightning Damage to Sword Attacks\n\nGood : Global Critical Strike Multiplier\n\nDecent : Attack Speed, Critical Strike Chance, Added Elemental (Non-Lightning) Damage\n\n\n\nYou also need one (should be enough) jewel with the mod \"Chance to blind enemies on hit with attacks\". 3% should be enough, and it will reduce your chances to get hit by quite a lot.\n\n\n\n\n\nSkill gems\n\n\n\nMy Skill Gems and Links\n\n\n\nMain Skill Lightning Strike (20/20) \u2013 Elemental Damage with Attacks (20/20) \u2013 Added Lightning Damage (20/20) \u2013 Multistrike (20/0) \u2013 Lightning Penetration (20/20) (5L) \u2013 Increased Critical Strikes (20/20) (6L)\n\n\n\nOther Possibilities : Swap out Increased Critical Strikes for Ancestral Call\n\n\n\nAs I use shroud of the lightless, I drop Lightning Penetration from my 6L setup, as Elemental Penetration from the armor has the same value has Lightning Penetration, but for all elements.\n\n\n\nWhy do I not 20% multistrike ? It only increases melee physical damage, which only affects the melee portion of Lightning Strike. The projectiles do not scale from melee physical damage but rather from your weapon\u2019s damage, the tooltip is a bit confusing in that regard. All in all, a 20% multistrike doesn\u2019t hurt us, but it\u2019s rather unnecessary and an extremely minor (barely 1k dps gain for me) improvement.\n\n\n\nIf you have a 20/20 Vaal Lightning Strike, you can put that in your 6L setup instead of a regular 20/20 Lightning Strike.\n\n\n\nIf you don\u2019t have a 20/20 Vaal Lightning Strike, here\u2019s the setup for VLS :\n\n\n\nVaal Lightning Strike (20/20) \u2013 Added Lightning Damage (20/20) \u2013 Elemental Damage with Attacks (20/20) \u2013 Elemental Focus (20/20)\n\n\n\nVLS is useful to give us a little dps boost. It comes up very often as it costs only 20 souls. It\u2019s also nice to drop it down somewhere while we go kill stuff in another room (for example, if you have a breach expanding in two different corridors, drop VLS in one and go hit stuff in the other, works wonders).\n\n\n\nA single-target alternative that I have not tested is Blade Flurry, replacing Multistrike with Concentrated Effect. It's possibly better for bosses, but once again, I did not test it. It's good for Atziri, though, since LS has so much AoE you will most of the time end up hitting the mirror clone during the splitting phase, and kill yourself very quickly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCWDT Setup\n\n\n\nCWDT (lvl 1) \u2013 Conductivity (lvl 5) \u2013 Summon Ice Golem (lvl 3) \u2013 Immortal Call (lvl 3)\n\n\n\nConductivity gives us a good damage boost as it reduces enemy resistances by an additional -29%. If you feel like you need more survivability instead, you can use Enfeeble in its place.\n\n\n\nIce Golem and Immortal Call are self-explanatory. I prefer to keep CWDT to a low level so conductivity procs as often as possible, but you can try to bump it a couple levels more if you want. However, I did not test that.\n\n\n\nMovement Skill\n\n\n\nMovement skill : Leap Slam \u2013 Faster Attacks \u2013 Fortify\n\nThe classic.\n\n\n\nNo Specific Links\n\n\n\nWrath (20/0) (More damage)\n\nHerald of Thunder (20/20) (More damage)\n\nBlood Rage (20/20) (More damage, also frenzy charge generator until you have enough points in Raider)\n\nAncestral Protector ( ?/0)\n\n\n\nLevel Ancestral Protector as high as your strength will allow. Since I already have too high STR requirements for my tastes, I kept it at level 12, which I find a reasonable amount.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBandits\n\nBandits\n\nKill all. If you are having mana issues, you can help Alira, but you\u2019ll want to switch to +2 passive points eventually once you have mana leech.\n\n\n\nAscendancy\n\nAscendancy\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/cOY7acW.png\n\n\n\nLevelling and Passive Trees\n\nLevelling Trees and Final Tree\n\n29 points https://www.pathofexile.com/passive-skill-tree/3.3.0/AAAABAIBAABeBiAGogguF9wZjiP2MHxNknSgePl9dX7dfyuNfY25m42jirvjxKLTftRS7YPuDu96_W7-ug==\n\n\n\nI didn\u2019t have anything in particular in mind while levelling, just taking some hp nodes and damage nodes here and there.

Also heading towards the shadow tree for, once again, some more HP, and damage nodes.\n\nFinal Tree - 114 points https://www.pathofexile.com/passive-skill-tree/3.3.0/AAAABAIBAABeBS0FtQYgBqIHHgguDPINjQ5ID8QRlha_F9wZjhnXGo0byB2DI_Yk_SaVKgsqOCpbLlMwWzB8Nj031Dt8Ps9DMUM2R35JUUp9TP9Nkk4qUUdS7FVLWhpbJluvXfJh4mKsZU1noGyMcFJ0oHTtdct4-Xn2eu99dX7dfyt_xn_7h3aJ04w2jX2Nfo25jb-TJ5UumCObjZ2qoS-io6OKpcusl60ztMW3trjKu-O9Nr3mvoq-p8LswzPEos_d02_TftQj1FLWWNrB44Tjn-dU6mLtP-2D7g7vevDV8Yr8xf1u_rr_3g==\n\n\n\nWe finish by taking a couple more damage nodes, the jewel nodes, Acrobatics (I feel like it\u2019s not really needed before maps, but you can take it earlier if you wish), and Vaal Pact (for more leech). This is just a level 91 tree, so if you level further, you can grab some more nodes like Forces of Nature or Revenge of the Hunted for more damage and hp, respectively. There's also a few duellist starting nodes that gives you a bit of HP, if you want.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlaystyle\n\n\n\nNothing much really ! Just hit the ground with your sword like Thor (if Thor had a gender reassignment surgery and started to really be into nature and fencing), and watch the lightning fly ! Considering Lightning Strike fires ground projectiles, some obstacles might make it difficult to hit certain targets. This is why we have Leap Slam and Frenzy charges, to be able to reposition very quickly to hit hard to reach targets.\n\n\n\nDo know that Lightning Strike has two components, the melee attack and the projectiles.

Anything. Which quickly turned into a simple build with a regular weapon, as Hyaon\u2019s Fury is actually complete shit and is outclassed by any 10c rapier with proper stats.That\u2019s where my idea of using Raider also comes from (for a ridiculous amount of frenzy charges which would synergize even better with Hyaon\u2019s), and I decided to stick with it even with another sword as I like having a lot of frenzy charges.In any case, I wanted to make a build with a niche skill (and lightning strike is pretty niche, as far as i can tell), and this is what I came up with. It doesn\u2019t shine by its boss-killing capabilities, but it\u2019s a nice little build using a fun niche skill that can perfectly clear most content, and so is good as a league starter option.If I missed anything, my formatting isn't right, or anything else, do tell me. This is my first guide (as you can probably tell), so I'm prone to making mistakes.Enjoy the read !High AoE damageGood on a budget, can be pushed further with some investmentGood league-starter, the only item you really need is LycosidaeHigh movement speed thanks to Leap Slam and 8+ frenzy chargesCombines dodge, evasion and block for damage mitigationVery high lightning penetration (94% !)Can run phys reflect, curse immune maps easilyCan run maps up to T15 without any issuesNot the best at uber lab (izaro hits hard) but you can run it with relative easeExcels in open layoutsSquishy by nature as a RangerCan\u2019t run ele reflectCan run no leech maps but it requires some careT16 and Shaper might prove difficult, this is not a bosskiller build.Can sometimes be difficult to use in tight layouts or in the presence of obstaclesProbably not HC viableNothing much really ! Just hit the ground with your sword like Thor (if Thor had a gender reassignment surgery and started to really be into nature and fencing), and watch the lightning fly ! Considering Lightning Strike fires ground projectiles, some obstacles might make it difficult to hit certain targets. This is why we have Leap Slam and Frenzy charges, to be able to reposition very quickly to hit hard to reach targets.Do know that Lightning Strike has two components, the melee attack and the projectiles. The melee attack does a lot more damage than the projectiles (around 50-60% more if my math is right) but it also puts you more at risk since you are still kind of squishy.
