It's quite special that I wear lolita clothes now. When I was younger I hated girly clothes and I hated gothic clothes, I was pretty sacred of goths! After my goth/emo 'era' I started to wear lolita, isn't that weird?\n\nI mean at this time I have worn all kinds of clothes I hated when I was a kid.\n\n2. My favourite brands are Angelic Pretty and Moi-m\u00eame-Moiti\u00e9\n\n3. I love to wear lolita still I don't wear it very often. I would like to wear lolita more often but I can't. I need to look a little bit 'professional' for my study. I wear once a week lolita clothes, I'm always very happy to wear my favourite clothes!\n\n4. I admire Mana-Sama, he is my lolita idol. It's more like a love/hate thingy, I always talk about how much I hate him because I spend all my money on pretty Moiti\u00e9 clothes but secretly I admire him. It's so unfair, he is more than 20 (??) years older than me, wears dresses (it's man for those who don't know that ) and still looks better than me >.<\n\n9. I'm a sort of lifestyle lolita even though I don't wear it every day. I love to design my own clothes, I make my own clothes, I collect stuffed animals, I love to bake especially cupcakes, I 'collect' Ball Jointed Dolls,\n\nI read every day lolita blogs and I'm always searching for new lolita clothes.\n\n3 opmerkingen:\n\nNice to read about your 'bubble'. ^^I feel the same about nr.4. How does he manage to look so good, at his age? And he always manages to make me broke when releasing a new item..Or indirectly on egl_sales buying Moiti\u00e9..\n\nFollow this blog with bloglovin\n\nFollowers\n\nAbout me\n\nHello, my name is Violet.\nNice to meet you!\nI'm a girl who lives in an angelic cute world with a touch of darkness. This place is called Angelic Nostalgia,I collect my good memories here.\nI'm a Gothic Lolita and in Summer I wear Sweet Lolita from time to time. I love traveling, art, books, ball jointed dolls, cats, food and cute things.\nThank you for visiting my blog!\nDo you want to know more about me? Please ask me. ^__^"
