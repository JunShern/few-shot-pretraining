    "text": "A survey of anesthesiologist and anesthetist attitudes toward single-use vials in an academic medical center.\nTo evaluate whether proper implementation of safety measures was uniform at 5 hospitals, and to elucidate motivating factors that lead to nonadherence. Electronic anonymous survey instrument. Academic medical center. Of the 319 surveys sent to anesthesia providers across 5 hospitals, 89 responses were obtained. Questions addressed compliance with Centers of Disease Control (CDC) safety standards and the rationale for anesthesia providers' decisions to comply or not comply with these standards. 59.6% of respondents reported that they had reused vials between cases, while 40.4% had never done so. Of the 89 respondents, 63 (44%) felt that cost was the primary factor that prevented them from using entirely new medications on each case. Thirty-two (23%) reported convenience/efficiency as the reason; 11 (8%) responded that time prevented them from using entirely new medications on each case; 14 (10%) reported that the environment was a driving factor; and 3 individuals (2%) responded apathy. Eighteen (13%) responded \"other\" and, when asked to amplify a response, most of these individuals reported that they do use entirely new medications on each case. Safe anesthetic practices were not uniform among respondents, and one of the main reasons given for noncompliance with safe standards was cost."
