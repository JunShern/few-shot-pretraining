    "text": "Posts from the \u2018State Law\u2019 Category\n\nSubscribe\n\nDelaware\u2019s legalization of medical marijuana has fizzled in the wake of legal opinions that growers, distributors and state employees could be prosecuted under federal drug laws.\n\nGov. Jack Markell has suspended the regulation-writing and licensing process for medical marijuana dispensaries \u2014 effectively killing the program \u2014 and criticized the federal government for sending mixed signals on law enforcement, The News Journal has learned.\n\nU.S. Attorney Charles M. Oberly III has adopted the hard-line stance that just came out of President Barack Obama\u2019s Department of Justice. This stance accentuates the inherent conflict between federal marijuana laws and what is playing out in states that have authorized limited marijuana use for medicinal purposes.\n\n\u201c[G]rowing, distributing and possessing marijuana, in any capacity, other than as part of a federally authorized research program, is a violation of federal law regardless of state laws permitting such activities,\u201d Oberly wrote Thursday to Markell\u2019s attorney. \u201cMoreover, those who engage in financial transactions involving the proceeds of such activities may also be in violation of federal money laundering statutes.\u201d\n\nMarkell\u2019s office told The News Journal on Friday that Oberly\u2019s stance prevents the Department of Health and Social Services from issuing licenses to medical marijuana dispensaries, whose employees and owners may be subject to federal raids and prosecution.\n\nThe governor\u2019s office recently sought guidance from Oberly on whether state employees responsible for regulating and inspecting licensed, not-for-profit medical marijuana dispensaries could do their jobs without fear of prosecution.\n\nIn a statement Friday, the Democratic governor said he had no choice but to stop the program.\n\n\u201cTo do otherwise would put our state employees in legal jeopardy, and I will not do that,\u201d Markell said.\n\nWith the federal government firmly against large-scale dispensaries, state legislators may need to consider amending the law to allow doctor-approved patients to grow their own pot at home, said Rep. Helene Keeley, D-Wilmington South.\n\n\u201cMaybe we have to tweak the current law to make this happen,\u201d Keeley said. \u201cWe can\u2019t give up.\u201d\n\nNew approach\n\nOberly\u2019s letter is evidence of the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s changing attitude toward state medical marijuana laws since Obama took office.\n\nDuring his campaign for president in 2008, medical marijuana advocates were encouraged by Obama\u2019s vow to respect state laws. Oberly, a Democrat and former attorney general, is an Obama appointee.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a great betrayal of what he said when he was running for office,\u201d said Karen O\u2019Keefe, director of state policies at the Marijuana Policy Project, a Washington, D.C.-based lobbying group that helped write Delaware\u2019s law. \u201cIt\u2019s been a great disappointment.\u201d\n\nIn 2009, when the first version of a medical marijuana bill was introduced in the Delaware General Assembly, a key impetus for the debate was the newly elected Obama\u2019s pledge not to send his Department of Justice after those involved in state-sanctioned medical marijuana operations.\n\nThat policy was codified in an October 2009 memo written by then-Deputy Attorney General David Ogden that said prosecutions of medical marijuana patients and caregivers was \u201cunlikely to be an efficient use of limited federal resources.\u201d\n\nWith the Ogden memo as its backdrop, Delaware\u2019s legislative effort continued, culminating with the passage of the Medical Marijuana Act last May.\n\nA month later, new Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole issued a memo with a different tone in response to inquiries from a group of federal prosecutors nationwide.\n\nDrawing a corollary from the Ogden memo, Cole said patients and their caregivers were still safe from enforcement action but prosecutors were never meant to ignore \u201clarge-scale, privately owned industrial marijuana cultivation centers\u201d like those authorized in some states.\n\nIn the months after the Cole memo, federal law enforcement agencies raided growers and dispensaries in California and Montana.\n\nA U.S. attorney in northern California sent a letter to local public officials, warning them to quell their efforts to regulate and license marijuana growers or face criminal charges.\n\nIn January, prosecutors in Colorado mailed letters to two dozen medical marijuana dispensaries located within 1,000 feet of schools, notifying them of enhanced federal penalties for drug offenses committed near schools.\n\nLegal worries\n\nSince Delaware\u2019s passage of its medical marijuana law, the state Division of Public Health has been studying similar laws in other states and writing regulations that officials expected to publish this spring. Markell\u2019s recommended budget for the next fiscal year includes $480,000 for the implementation of the program, funded by proceeds from licensing dispensaries and patients.\n\n\u201cIt was our goal to exercise some caution before we move forward, to make sure we have some dialogue with federal prosecutors in Delaware and solicit their input,\u201d Barlow said.\n\nSpecifically, Barlow said, the administration is concerned that the medical marijuana distribution plan outlined in Delaware\u2019s law falls under the parameters outlined in the Cole memo.\n\nThe statute mandates the establishment of one marijuana dispensary \u2014 called a Compassionate Care Center \u2014 in each of the three counties, with the possibility of more centers in future years.\n\nOperators of the centers are to be nonprofit entities selected via a competitive bidding process administered by the state\u2019s Division of Public Health, and would be responsible for cultivating, preparing and distributing the marijuana in cooperation with state regulators and under tight state control.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the Cole memo, it focuses on this large-scale, industrial distribution model, and what we have in Delaware is a distribution model that centralizes that into one place,\u201d Barlow said. \u201cIt seems to be something the Cole memo is looking to specifically.\u201d\n\nThe administration was also worried that Delaware\u2019s medical marijuana distribution structure could put state employees in danger of federal prosecution because of their close work with the dispensaries.\n\n\u201cThe governor\u2019s concern is that we\u2019re not doing things to put state employees potentially in the way of the federal government\u2019s new enforcement,\u201d Barlow said.\n\nIn his response to Barlow, Oberly reaffirmed the Cole corollary to the Ogden memo and said the DOJ will not target patients or caregivers, but distribution is to be treated differently.\n\n\u201cEnterprises engaged in the cultivation, manufacture and sale of marijuana directly violate federal law,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIndividuals and organizations that participate in the unlawful cultivation and distribution of marijuana could be subject to civil and criminal penalties.\u201d\n\nOberly also said state workers are fair game for prosecution, just like anyone who is part of a marijuana distribution operation.\n\nProsecution decisions would made on a case-by-case basis, Oberly said.\n\nThe compassion centers were the linchpin of the medical marijuana bill\u2019s getting bipartisan support in the Delaware General Assembly, Keeley said.\n\n\u201cIn the absence of such compassion centers, patients may be forced to obtain marijuana illicitly, unlawfully grow their own marijuana or forgo use of medical marijuana entirely,\u201d Barlow wrote Friday in response Oberly\u2019s Thursday letter. \u201cThat appears to be the unfortunate consequence of a federal policy that appears to offer mercy to cancer patients and others with a serious medical need for marijuana, but actually threatens criminal and civil sanctions for those who might help them safely obtain that relief.\u201d\n\nLike this:\n\nMarijuana is a topic of significant public discourse in the United States, and while many are familiar with the discussions, it is not always easy to find the latest, research-based information on marijuana to answer to the common questions about its health effects, or the differences between Federal and state laws concerning the drug. Confusing messages being presented by popular culture, media, proponents of \u201cmedical\u201d marijuana, and political campaigns to legalize all marijuana use perpetuate the false notion that marijuana is harmless. This significantly diminishes efforts to keep our young people drug free and hampers the struggle of those recovering from addiction.\n\nThe Administration steadfastly opposes legalization of marijuana and other drugs because legalization would increase the availability and use of illicit drugs, and pose significant health and safety risks to all Americans, particularly young people.\n\nThis Web-based resource center provides the general public, community leaders, and other interested people with the facts, knowledge, and tools to better understand and address marijuana in their communities.\n\nThis resource center will be regularly updated and expanded to address emerging issues, research, and prevention tools, and highlight successful local efforts to reduce marijuana use.\n\nLike this:\n\nAccording to the National Conference of State Legislatures, since 1996, 16 states and Washington, DC have passed laws allowing smoked marijuana to be used for a variety of medical conditions.\n\nIt is important to recognize that these state marijuana laws do not change the fact that using marijuana continues to be an offense under Federal law. Nor do these state laws change the criteria or process for approval of safe and effective medications, including marijuana.\n\nMany of these state laws began in order to create a legal defense to state criminal possession laws or to remove state criminal penalties for purported medical use of marijuana. Since then, many have evolved into state authorization for state-based production and distribution of marijuana for purported medical purposes. These state laws vary greatly in their criteria and implementation, and many states are experiencing vigorous internal debates about the safety, efficacy, and legality of their marijuana laws. Many local governments are even creating zoning and enforcement ordinances that prevent marijuana dispensaries from operating in their communities.\n\nLike this:\n\nIn a major case before the US Supreme Court, Gonzalez v. Raich, the court ruled that the Federal Controlled Substances Act commerce clause gave Congress authority to prohibit the local cultivation and use of marijuana.\n\nFacts of the Case\n\nIn 1996 California voters passed the Compassionate Use Act, legalizing marijuana for medical use. California\u2019s law conflicted with the federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA), which banned possession of marijuana. After the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) seized doctor-prescribed marijuana from a patient\u2019s home, a group of medical marijuana users sued the DEA and U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft in federal district court.\n\nThe medical marijuana users argued the Controlled Substances Act \u2013 which Congress passed using its constitutional power to regulate interstate commerce \u2013 exceeded Congress\u2019 commerce clause power. The district court ruled against the group. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and ruled the CSA unconstitutional as it applied to intrastate (within a state) medical marijuana use. Relying on two U.S. Supreme Court decisions that narrowed Congress\u2019 commerce clause power \u2013 U.S. v. Lopez (1995) and U.S. v. Morrison (2000) \u2013 the Ninth Circuit ruled using medical marijuana did not \u201csubstantially affect\u201d interstate commerce and therefore could not be regulated by Congress.\n\nQuestions\n\nDoes the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801) exceed Congress\u2019 power under the commerce clause as applied to the intrastate cultivation and possession of marijuana for medical use?\n\nDoes the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801) exceed Congress\u2019 power under the commerce clause as applied to the intrastate cultivation and possession of marijuana for medical use?\n\nConclusion\n\nNo. In a 6-3 opinion delivered by Justice John Paul Stevens, the Court held that the commerce clause gave Congress authority to prohibit the local cultivation and use of marijuana, despite state law to the contrary. Stevens argued that the Court\u2019s precedent \u201cfirmly established\u201d Congress\u2019 commerce clause power to regulate purely local activities that are part of a \u201cclass of activities\u201d with a substantial effect on interstate commerce.\n\nThe majority argued that Congress could ban local marijuana use because it was part of such a \u201cclass of activities\u201d: the national marijuana market. Local use affected supply and demand in the national marijuana market, making the regulation of intrastate use \u201cessential\u201d to regulating the drug\u2019s national market.\n\nLike this:\n\nThe Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986. requires that the Governor cause to be published a list of those chemicals \u201cknown to the state\u201d to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity. The Act specifies that \u201ca chemical is known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity \u2026 if in the opinion of the state\u2019s qualified experts the chemical has been clearly shown through scientifically valid testing according to generally accepted principles to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity.\u201d\n\nThe lead agency for implementing Proposition 65 is the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) of the California Environmental Protection Agency. The \u201cstate\u2019s qualified experts\u201d regarding findings of carcinogenicity are identified as the members of the Carcinogen Identification Committee of the OEHHA Science Advisory Board.\n\nOEHHA announced the selection of marijuana smoke as a chemical for consideration for listing by the CIC in the California Regulatory Notice Register on December 12, 2007, subsequent to consultation with the Committee at their November 19, 2007 meeting. At that meeting, the Committee advised OEHHA to prepare hazard identification materials for marijuana smoke.\n\nAt their May 29, 2009 meeting the Committee, by a vote of five in favor and one against, found that marijuana smoke had been \u201cclearly shown through scientifically valid testing according to generally accepted principles to cause cancer.\u201d\n\nLike this:\n\nNullification generally is considered to take one of two forms. The first is where a State acts within the system, whether through a court challenge, or through concentrated series of efforts designed to repeal or amend offending legislative provisions. The second form is most simply described as outright defiance of the law; in other words, a State simply would ignore a federal provision, or a decision of a federal court.\n\nNullification, If Meant As A Term Through Which Offending Legislation or Judicial Decisions Are Overturned By Working Within The Existent Constitutional And Legal Framework, Is Permissible And Encouraged By Our System of Checks and Balances.\n\nIdaho has historically participated in a number of these efforts including the current challenge to the Healthcare Reform Law, as well as various resolutions addressed to the Federal Government with respect to the state sovereignty and specific federal legislative enactments. (See HeR 64, 44,and SJM 106 (2010)). These examples reflect how a State can work within the constitutionally designed system to overturn or amend a provision that offends a State\u2019s notion of sovereignty and federal overreaching.\n\nNullification As Defiance Of Federal Law Or Enactment Is Inconsistent With A State Officer\u2019s Duty To Act In Conformity With The Federal And State Constitutions.\n\nNullification is generally the argument that States have the ability to determine the constitutionality of a federal enactment, and if a State finds the enactment unconstitutional it can ignore or otherwise refuse to adhere to the federal requirements.\n\nThe basis for this argument is that the States came together to create the federal government, and therefore the States retain the ultimate discretion as to the reach of federal authority.! The adoption of these Resolutions in some respects represents the apex of the ongoing argument between Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson over the scope and influence of the fledgling federal government.\n\nThese arguments arose cyclically throughout the Nation\u2019s early history, reaching a virtual breaking point in 1828-1833 in what was referred to as the \u201cNullification Crisis.\u201d President Andrew Jackson expressly rejected the theory of nullification as incompatible with the existence of the Union and destructive to the very purpose of the the Constitution. Southern State nullification advocates nevertheless continued to press their cause, and their arguments formed a central justification for the Civil War.\n\nThe Legal Difficulty Of Idaho\u2019s Nullification Claim.\n\nAs an historical matter, many of the original States came into existence first as English colonies and then as sovereign parties to the Articles of Confederation. Idaho\u2019s road to state status followed a much different path.\n\nVirtually all land within Idaho is the result of the United States making a claim to the land, which was disputed by the British until the adoption of several treaties leading ultimately to the creation of the Oregon Territory. Congress then created the Territory of Idaho and, ultimately, the State of Idaho. Once Idaho was admitted as a State, it acquired all of the privileges and immunities held by each of the other States, but as reflected above, the right of nullification, the right of secession, and the compact theory had all been rejected by the United States by the time of statehood.\n\nThe framers of the Idaho Constitution were acutely aware of that fact. Hamilton actually suggested sending the Army into Virginia as a pretext-thus even the earliest arguments for nullification were viewed as latent arguments for civil war. See also Jonathon Elliot, \u201cAnswers of the Several State Legislatures: \u201cState of New Hampshire\u201d Debates in the Several State Conventions on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution, pp. 538-539. (1907).\n\nJackson also expressly rejected the right to secede, noting that the Constitution forms a government, not a league of States. President Jackson\u2019s Proclamation Regarding Nullification, December 10, 1832.\n\nJoint British and United States Claim was provided for in Treaty of 1818. The Oregon Treaty (1846) established the boundary between United States claims and British Claims at the 49th Parallel. The territory of Oregon was created on August 14, 1848. The territory of Idaho was created on March 4,1863. Reviewing the Idaho Admission Bill, \u00a7 19 specifically applies the laws of the United States.\n\nState inseparable part of the Union.\n\nThe State of Idaho is an inseparable part of the American Union, and the Constitution of the United States is the supreme law of the land.\n\nThe framers therefore expressly recognized Idaho\u2019s status as a part of the United States and the supremacy of the United States Constitution. Consistent with this recognition, every legislator is required to affirm \u201cthat I will support the constitution of the United States and the constitution of the State of Idaho. Legislators and other state officials, in other words, pledge to carry out their duties in a fashion that directly conflicts with the second form of the nullification theory.\n\nThe alpha and omega of the nullification theory, in sum, rest upon rejecting the principle that the United States Constitution as the supreme law of the land. The theory runs contrary to the very purpose of the federal constitution and Idaho\u2019s express constitutional acknowledgment in Article I, \u00a7 3 of that supremacy.\n\nCourts Have Expressly Rejected Nullification\n\nOur history is replete with federal enactments that were unpopular in one State or another, or even within regions. Taking the logic of the nullification theory to its natural extension, federal law would become a patchwork of regulation depending upon which States chose to comply. It is hardly surprising, given this specter, that no court has ever upheld a State effort to nullify a federal law.\n\nThe most instructive case on nullification is likely Cooper v. Aaron. This case arose out of a belief by the State of Arkansas that it was not bound to follow the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Brown v. Board of Education. 9 Arkansas, through its governor and legislature, claimed that there is no duty on the part of state official to obey federal court orders based upon the Court\u2019s interpretation of the federal constitution.\n\nThe governor and the legislature, in practical effect, were advancing the theory that the States were the ultimate arbiters of the constitutionality of federal enactments and decisions.\n\nThe Court expressly rejected this argument stating: \u201cNo state legislator or executive or judicial officer can war against the Constitution without violating his undertaking to support it.\u201d The Court went further: A governor who asserts power to nullify a federal court manifests that the fiat of a state governor, and not the Constitution of the United States, would be the supreme law of the land.\n\nConclusion\n\nThere is no right to pick and choose which federal laws a State will follow. Aside from ignoring the Supremacy Clause in Article VI, Clause 2 of the United States Constitution, that contention cannot be reconciled with Article I, \u00a7 3 of the Idaho Constitution or the oath of office prescribed in Article III, \u00a7 25. I hope this brief analysis responds adequately to your inquiry.\n\nLike this:\n\nAs Colorado\u2019s Attorney General I take an oath to uphold the U.S. Constitution and the Colorado Constitution. As part of this job, I frequently urge upon the state and federal courts a particular interpretation of these constitutional documents.\n\nBut the final word on the meaning of the U.S. Constitution is the U.S. Supreme Court and the final word on the meaning of the Colorado Constitution is the Colorado Supreme Court.\n\nIn a dispute on whether federal laws trump state laws under the Supremacy Clause, the U.S. Supreme Court has the final say.\n\nIn Gonzales v. Raich [case], the U.S. Supreme Court held that even when marijuana is grown, distributed and consumed within a single state, it does affect interstate commerce and is therefore subject to federal regulation. While you or I may find this decision by a majority that included Justice Antonin Scalia to be \u201cjudicial activism,\u201d it is nonetheless the law of the land. In Florida v. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, scheduled to be heard by the U.S. Supreme Court in March, the federal government is citing Gonzales v. Raich and other similar cases to argue that the Commerce Clause allows it to require every American to buy health insurance or face an economic sanction.\n\nMy fellow attorneys general and I have successfully argued in a U.S. District Court and the in 11th Circuit Court of Appeals that one\u2019s failure to buy a particular product or service at the federal government\u2019s direction is economic inactivity (unlike growing and selling a crop) and therefore not subject to congressional regulation under the Commerce Clause.\n\nWe argue that if the federal government is able to regulate your economic decision making in such a manner, federalism is essentially dead. Rather than having limited enumerated powers under Article I, Section 8, the federal government would have largely unbridled power in all areas not addressed in the Bill of Rights.\n\nBut make no mistake about it: If the U.S. Supreme Court should determine that the individual health insurance mandate is a proper exercise of the commerce power by Congress, that will be the law of the land and Americans will be left to pursue political remedies as opposed to legal ones.\n\nSuch is the rule of law in America. Because of the rule of law, until a change of policy by Congress, medical marijuana remains in violation of federal law. The state attorney general cannot change that.\n\nLike this:\n\nAB 390, a bill to legalize marijuana in California, has gone up in smoke at the State Capitol.\n\nChildren need to grow up in safe neighborhoods and attend schools free of marijuana users and sellers. We need to continue to protect our youth from the dangers of drugs. That starts with stopping the proliferation of pot.\n\nThe demise of this disastrous California bill goes to show that our voice was heard at the State Capitol and legislators on both sides of the aisle agreed we don\u2019t want a proliferation of WEED in our streets and communities\u2026our churches\u2026parks and schools.\n\nLegalizing marijuana is bad public policy and most of the legislators know it. In my opinion, once the public wakes up and understands the dangers of legalizing marijuana, legislators voting to legalize may find themselves on the wrong side of public opinion. A lot of voters are going to let their representatives know they will not stand for legalizing such a dangerous drug.\n\nMarijuana is a dangerous and destructive drug\u2026and we must not rest until the pro-legalizers are defeated once and for all.\n\nTo think some California lawmakers would resort to legalizing the sale and manufacture of drugs to generate tax revenue in which to balance our state budget is an outrage!\n\nThere are many ways to get the economy moving again. Putting a flood of mind altering drugs on the streets and then taxing their sales is not one of them.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t make sense for our legislators to ban cigarette usage in public places because it is harmful to health, while at the same time saying \u201cyes\u201d to marijuana smoke, which is also carcinogenic.\n\nCalifornia lawmakers recently banned trans fat because it is harmful to health. And now they want to make marijuana legal because it\u2019s supposedly good for consumption in certain cases?\n\nIf we say marijuana is okay for adults\u2026then what message do do send our children? That it\u2019s okay for them too?\n\nHow do we expect our youth to say \u201cNo!\u201d to drugs when the adults are saying \u201cyes.\u201d\n\nWhy would our public policymakers legalize marijuana, tax it and then go back and use that same money AND MORE for drug prevention programs to convince kids to not smoke dope. It\u2019s bad public policy. It doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\nTaxing marijuana is \u201cblood money\u201d plain and simple. And California lawmakers would have blood on their hands if they voted to legalize this dangerous drug.\n\nPot should never be legal for general use in California. It\u2019s bad for health, it\u2019s bad for our communities, it\u2019s bad for kids and it\u2019s bad for our brains.\n\nCalifornia will go down a dangerous path for which there will be no turning back if voters legalize marijuana. To think people will smoke pot while driving on our roads, visiting our parks, walking in our neighborhoods, sitting in their backyards (with the odor wafting over our fences) and passing near our schools. It is a disaster waiting to happen of enormous consequences. Has anyone given any thought to this?\n\nRogue legislators like Tom Ammiano want to legalize marijuana because they say it will be a windfall for the economy. Many others think it would actually be a drain on the state budget and the root cause of many job losses due to absenteeism and lost productivity.\n\nThere is no guarantee that legalization would undercut the black market, especially if the drug is taxed. Drug pushers would simply sell it \u201ctax free.\u201d\n\nLegalizers think the revenue from a new marijuana tax will solve California\u2019s budget woes, but AB 390 specifically states that people can grow their own weed, which many will do. How do you tax that?\n\nWhere will we get the money to pay for a new watchdog agency to regulate the drug? And will employees of this same agency be allowed to smoke it during their work breaks since it will be legal?\n\nAB 390 to legalize marijuana was passed in the California Assembly Public Safety Committee (Tom Ammiano\u2019s committee) on January 12, 2010. Increase the use of drugs, and our public will be safer? Was there another motive?\n\nPresident Obama was right to declare he wants to usher in a new era of responsibility; and that includes ensuring marijuana remains classified as an illegal drug. There\u2019s no excuse for legalizing another harmful drug known kill through the inducements of carcinogens and mental instability.\n\nBecause marijuana is illegal at the federal level, one can imagine California becoming a favored destination for drug buyers \u2013 and an exporter of drug dealers.\n\nThe \u201clegalizers\u201d will argue we are overcrowding our prisons with people arrested for simple possession of marijuana. The truth is: no one ever stays in jail for more than a day just for possessing it. Anyone that is in jail or prison for marijuana either:\n\nAlso had a role in distribution; or,\n\nPled down to possession in exchange for information; or,\n\nViolated terms of parole/probation, and their original crime was much more serious\n\nLegalizers say: \u201cIf marijuana is legalized we can tax it and bring in much needed revenue to our state.\u201d\n\nThe truth:\n\nIn 2005, the State of California spent $19.9 billion dollars on substance abuse and addiction or $545.09 per capita on alcohol and tobacco. But, the State of California collected $1.4 billion dollars of tax revenue or $38.69 per capita on the sale of alcohol and tobacco products. The costs far exceeded the revenue, and marijuana would likely follow a similar trend.\n\nThe tax revenue does not account for the additional public health concerns and costs, such as cancer risks due to smoke inhalation or increased mental illness due to prolonged use.\n\nLegalizers say: \u201cPeople with medical issues should be able to smoke marijuana to relieve pain or other debilitating symptoms.\u201d\n\nThe truth:\n\nThere is likely medical benefit from components in the cannabis plant. This is very different than legalizing smoked marijuana.\n\nMedicine should never be determined by voters.\n\nThe general public does not have the knowledge necessary to vote on whether a particular pill or patch is beneficial for the treatment of heart disease, attention deficit disorder, or diabetes. Why is this different?\n\nThe 1999 IOM report said that smoked marijuana should generally not be recommended for medical use; we don\u2019t \u201csmoke\u201d medicine.\n\nLegalizers say: \u201cMarijuana toxicity has never killed anyone.\u201d\n\nThe truth:\n\nMarijuana contributes to dependence, mental illness, lung obstruction, lung cancer, memory loss, motor skill disruption and other harms in a way that tobacco does not, and its harms are underappreciated.\n\nThere have been numerous cases of fatal car and other accidents caused by someone under the influence of marijuana.\n\nSmoked marijuana is not medicine. Pot smoke contains more carcinogens than cigarette smoke and is simply not healthy for you. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration routinely tests new drugs according to a rigorous protocol to prove their safety before they are allowed to be sold to the public as medicine. Marijuana has passed no such test.\n\nLegalization will increase drug use and health care costs. Marijuana is an addictive drug that poses significant health consequences to its users. Recent studies have linked marijuana use to birth defects, respiratory system damage, cancer, mental illness, violence, infertility, and immune system damage.\n\nThe latest information from the U.S. Treatment Episode Data Set reports that 16.1% of drug treatment admissions were for marijuana as the primary drug of abuse, compared to 6% in 1992.\n\nLegalization will increase crime-related costs. 75% of children in foster care are placed there because of a parent\u2019s substance abuse. Sexual assault is frequently facilitated by substance use \u2013 some experts put the number at over 60%. The U.S. Department of Justice found that 61% of domestic violence offenders also have substance abuse problems.\n\nAll forms of marijuana are mind-altering (psychoactive). In other words, they change how the brain works. A lot of other chemicals are found in marijuana, too \u2014 about 400 of them, some of which are carcinogenic. Marijuana is addictive with more teens in treatment with a primary diagnosis of marijuana dependence than for all other illicit drugs combined.\n\nLong-term marijuana abuse can lead to addiction; Long-term marijuana abusers trying to quit report irritability, sleeplessness, decreased appetite, anxiety, and drug craving, all of which make it difficult to quit.\n\nNumerous studies have shown marijuana smoke to contain carcinogens and to be an irritant to the lungs. In fact, marijuana smoke contains 50\u201370 percent more carcinogenic hydrocarbons than does tobacco smoke. Marijuana users usually inhale more deeply and hold their breath longer than tobacco smokers do, which further increase the lungs\u2019 exposure to carcinogenic smoke.\n\nDriving experiments show that marijuana affects a wide range of skills needed for safe driving \u2014 thinking and reflexes are slowed, making it hard for drivers to respond to sudden, unexpected events. Also, a driver\u2019s ability to \u201ctrack\u201d (stay in lane) through curves, to brake quickly, and to maintain speed and the proper distance between cars is affected. Research shows that these skills are impaired for at least 4-6 hours after smoking a single marijuana cigarette, long after the \u201chigh\u201d is gone. Marijuana presents a definite danger on the road.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike this:\n\nToday a full 16 percent of the U.S. population is dependent on alcohol, nicotine or other drugs. Another 27 percent of the general population engages in use of these substances in ways that put themselves and others at risk, including underage and adult excessive drinking, tobacco use, and misuse of pain relievers, stimulants and depressants. For a staggering 43 percent of the nation, then \u2014 nearly every other American \u2014 addiction and risky substance use are a matter of public health.\n\nAddiction is America\u2019s number one health care and health cost problem. Approximately 30 percent of our federal and state health care spending is attributable to this disease. Across all government spending, the total financial cost is nearly $500 billion annually."
