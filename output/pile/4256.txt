A $25 late fee will be assessed after the 3rd of the month. MasterCard and Visa debit and credit cards are accepted. All accounts must have a card on file. Silhouette Dance Company is authorized to charge your account the $25 NSF fee should there be insufficient funds.\nThere is a 10% tuition discount when tuition is paid by the semester.

If you wish to unenroll you must be sure to give the 30 days notice before the 1st of the month or else the next month will be charged via auto draft.\nNon Refundable Fees Auto Drafted Performance Fees\nIt is assumed that ALL STUDENTS will perform in all performances when enrolled and all non-refundable fees associated with the performances are auto drafted. There will be 2 performances throughout the year, a Christmas show and an end of year annual recital.\nWe must receive email notification by September 1 (Christmas show) and October 1st, 2017 (Annual Recital) that your dancer is not participating in order to ensure costume and recital fees are not charged.

The Recital Fee is $80 per family and helps cover the cost of the production (theatre rental, backdrop, keepsake programs, etc.) so the show will be free for your family and friends to attend.\nAttendance\nRegular attendance is the student's and parent's responsibility and is extremely important for dancers to learn and review steps and combinations with their class. Excessive absences may hinder their progress and necessitate a change in class level.\nIn the spring, once students have begun learning their recital dances, no more than 4 absences will be allowed otherwise student may be required to attend and pay for private lessons in order to perform in the routine. Students are always welcome to take a make-up lesson within a similar class level.
