MIND.\nIN REALITY, 40% OF THOSE\nEMISSIONS IN THE U.S. STEM FROM\nTHE ENERGY USED TO HEAT, COOL,\nLIGHT, AND POWER OUR BUILDINGS.\nBUT A NEW RESIDENTIAL\nDEVELOPMENT IN FLORIDA IS TRYING\nTO SHOW THERE'S A DIFFERENT WAY.\nTHIS STORY IS PART OF OUR\nONGOING SERIES \"PERIL AND\nPROMISE-- THE CHALLENGE OF\nCLIMATE CHANGE.\"\nIT TOOK THE LOCAL UTILITY\nCOMPANY MORE THAN A YEAR TO\nBUILD THIS 440 ACRE SOLAR ARRAY\nIN SOUTHWEST FLORIDA.\n>> IT'S ONE OF THE LARGEST IF\nNOT THE LARGEST IN THE STATE.\nBUT MORE IMPORTANTLY IT POWERS,\nIT POWERS THE TOWN OF BABCOCK\nRANCH.\n>> Sreenivasan: SYD KITSON ONCE\nPLAYED FOOTBALL FOR THE GREEN\nBAY PACKERS AND DALLAS COWBOYS.\nNOW A DEVELOPER, KITSON IS THE\nMASTERMIND BEHIND BABCOCK RANCH,\nAN 18-ACRE PLANNED COMMUNITY.\nAT ITS PEAK, KITSON SAYS THE\nDEVELOPMENT WILL HAVE CLOSE TO\n20,000 HOMES, ALL POWERED BY THE\nSUN.\n>> THE IDEA FOR US FROM THE\nBEGINNING WAS TO CREATE THE MOST\nENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE, THE\nMOST SUSTAINABLE NEW TOWN THAT\nHAD EVER BEEN DEVELOPED.\n>> Sreenivasan: IN 2006,\nKITSON'S REAL ESTATE COMPANY\nBOUGHT 91,000 ACRES OF LAND,\nTHEN SOLD 80% OF IT TO THE STATE\nOF FLORIDA TO BE PRESERVED\nFOREVER.\nTHE COMPANY IS USING THE\nREMAINING PROPERTY, MOSTLY\nFORMER FARM AND ROCK MINING LAND\nTO CREATE BABCOCK RANCH.\nTHAT INCLUDES MORE THAN 8,000\nACRES FOR GREEN SPACE.\nTHE FIRST RESIDENTS MOVED IN IN\nJANUARY.\nTHE HOPE IS THAT BY 2040,\nBABCOCK RANCH WILL BE HOME TO\n50,000 PEOPLE.\nAND DEMONSTRATE THAT GOING GREEN\nIS GOOD BUSINESS.\n>> IT JUST SEEMED LIKE A GREAT\nOPPORTUNITY TO PROVE THAT YOU\nCAN DO IT THE RIGHT WAY.\nTHAT YOU CAN PRESERVE LAND, THAT\nPRESERVATION AND DEVELOPMENT CAN\nWORK HAND IN HAND.\n>> Sreenivasan: BUT THE AMBITION\nGOES BEYOND SOLAR POWER AND\nPRESERVATION.\nTHE GOAL IS FOR BABCOCK RANCH TO\nBE A MODEL OF SUSTAINABILITY.\nTHE DEVELOPMENT REQUIRES ALL THE\nHOMES AND COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS\nTO BE CERTIFIED GREEN BY THE\nFLORIDA GREEN BUILDING\nCOALITION.\n>> BUILDERS WERE LIKE, \"REALLY?\nYOU WANT ME TO DO WHAT?\nTHAT'S GOING TO BLOW MY BUDGET.\"\n>> Sreenivasan: JENNIFER\nLANGUELL IS A SUSTAINABLE DESIGN\nCONSULTANT HIRED BY KITSON'S\nFIRM.\nSHE WORKS WITH THE BUILDERS AT\nBABCOCK RANCH, STEERING THEM\nTOWARDS ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY\nBUILDING TECHNIQUES AND\nMATERIALS.\n>> SO WHY I WANTED TO GET YOU\nGUYS OUT HERE TO THIS HOUSE IN\nPARTICULAR, WAS BECAUSE IT'S\nKIND OF THIS HOUSE IN HIS\nUNDERPANTS STAGE AND SO WE CAN\nKIND OF SEE WHAT'S BEHIND THOSE\nWALLS.\n>> Sreenivasan: SHE POINTS TO\nINSULATION IN THE ROOF, FOAM IN\nTHE CONCRETE WALLS, AND EVEN THE\nTHICKNESS OF WINDOWS.\nALL OF THESE COMPONENTS ARE\nSPECIFICALLY SELECTED TO\nOPTIMIZE ENERGY EFFICIENCY.\n>> WE'RE LOOKING AT ABOUT A 27%\nENERGY REDUCTION OVER FLORIDA\nENERGY CODE AND THAT'S ABOUT A\n40 TO 42% ENERGY REDUCTION OVER\nTHE NATIONAL AVERAGE.\n>> I WANTED THE SMALLEST\nPOSSIBLE HOME.\n>> Sreenivasan: RICHARD AND\nROBIN KINLEY WERE THE VERY FIRST\nRESIDENTS OF BABCOCK RANCH.\nTHE SEMI-RETIRED COUPLE MOVED\nHERE IN JANUARY FROM THE ATLANTA\nAREA TO ESCAPE THE CONGESTION OF\nTHE CITY AND LEAD A MORE ECO-\nFRIENDLY LIFE.\n>> I GREW UP ON THE EAST COAST\nOF FLORIDA AND I SAW HOMES JUST\nKIND OF THROWN UP AND NOT\nTHOUGHT THROUGH ALL THAT WELL.\n>> IT'S MORE OF AN INTENTION TO\nLIVE IN THIS KIND OF COMMUNITY.\nPRETTY MUCH EVERYONE THAT'S\nMOVED IN SEEMS TO BE A SIMILAR\nMIND AS FAR AS SUSTAINABILITY.\n>> Sreenivasan: THE KINLEYS OWN\nTWO CARS, ONE OF WHICH IS\nELECTRIC.\nEVERY GARAGE IS PRE-WIRED WITH\nENOUGH POWER TO EASILY CHARGE\nIT.\nBUT LIVING IN A TOWN DESIGNED TO\nBE WALKABLE-- BABCOCK RANCH HAS\nMILES OF TRAILS-- THE KINLEYS\nSAY THEY OFTEN GO SEVERAL DAYS\nWITHOUT DRIVING AT ALL.\n>> I LOVE THE IDEA OF GETTING\nAWAY FROM CARS.\nI MEAN I THINK CARS ARE JUST\nLITERALLY CHOKING AMERICA TO\nDEATH.\n>> Sreenivasan: THE TOWN IS\nTESTING ONE OF THE STATE'S FIRST\nDRIVERLESS SHUTTLE SYSTEMS,\nPOWERED BY ELECTRICITY GENERATED\nFROM THE SOLAR PANELS.\nTHE GOAL IS TO GIVE EVERY\nRESIDENT ACCESS TO THE VEHICLES\nVIA A RIDE HAILING APP.\nAND SYD KITSON SAYS THAT MAY BE\nFEASIBLE BY NEXT YEAR.\n>> WE'RE HOPING WITHIN TEN YEARS\nPEOPLE WILL HAVE NEED FOR ONLY\nONE CAR AND THEN SHORTLY\nTHEREAFTER THEY WON'T NEED A CAR\nAT ALL.\n>> Sreenivasan: IN THE MEANTIME\nRESIDENTS KEEP COMING, ABOUT 200\nSO FAR.\nJASMIN AND JOSHUA DAY WEREN'T\nLOOKING FOR A COMMUNITY LIKE\nTHIS.\nBUT JUST A WEEK AFTER\nDISCOVERING THE TOWN, THEY PUT A\nDEPOSIT DOWN ON A HOME.\n>> HE HAD A CONVERSATION WITH A\nCO-WORKER WHO WAS JOKING WITH\nHIM BECAUSE WE KIND OF ARE MORE,\nHIPPY, I GUESS MAYBE IN SOME OF\nTHE THINGS THAT WE DO.\nAND THEY WERE JOKING AND THEY\nWERE LIKE, \"OH WE HEARD ABOUT\nTHIS TOWN IT'S LIKE THIS\nSUSTAINABLE CITY THERE'S SOLAR\nPANELS, YOU GUYS WOULD LOVE IT.\"\nAND I LOOKED IT UP AND I WAS\nLIKE I REALLY ACTUALLY DO LOVE\nTHIS TOWN.\n>> Sreenivasan: JOSHUA, A\nPHYSICAL THERAPIST, GOT A JOB AT\nTHE LOCAL HEALTH CENTER IN THE\nTOWN'S COMMERCIAL HUB BEFORE\nTHEY MOVED IN.\nIT'S WHERE THE FIRST BUILDINGS\nWENT UP.\nTHERE'S ALSO A RESTAURANT AND\nCOFFEE SHOP, A SMALL GROCERY\nSTORE, AND A BRAND NEW SCHOOL\nAND THIS IS ALL STRATEGIC.\nIT'S EARLY IN THE PROJECT, BUT\nKITSON'S GOAL IS TO BUILD A\nSELF-CONTAINED TOWN: PROVIDE\nROBUST LOCAL BUSINESSES WITH JOB\nOPPORTUNITIES SO RESIDENTS WILL\nBE LESS LIKELY TO JUMP IN A CAR\nAND LEAVE.\nIN FACT, JOSHUA'S NEW COMMUTE IS\nJUST A FIVE MINUTE BIKE RIDE.\n>> FOR US, BEING PART OF LIKE A\nCOMMUNITY OF PEOPLE WHO ARE ALSO\nTHINKING THIS, IT'S NOT JUST OUR\nCHOICES.\nIT'S YOU KNOW BUILDERS, IT'S\nLANDSCAPERS, IT'S PEOPLE WHO ARE\nBUYING FROM THE FARMERS MARKET\nINSTEAD OF YOU KNOW X, Y AND Z.\nLIKE, FOR US IT'S REALLY AN\nENDLESS STREAM OF CHOICES.\n>> Sreenivasan: THE SOLAR PANELS\nAND GREEN BUILDINGS MAY BE THE\nMOST VISIBLE SUSTAINABILITY\nFEATURES AT BABCOCK RANCH.\nBUT ACCORDING TO ENGINEER AMY\nWICKS, IT'S WATER CONSERVATION\nTHAT SHAPED THE DESIGN OF THE\nCOMMUNITY.\n>> IT'S REALLY A UNIQUE SYSTEM\nHERE AND IT'S REALLY NOT\nSOMETHING THAT'S BEEN DONE IN\nRESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS THUS\nFAR.\n>> Sreenivasan: DRIVING ALONG\nTHE TOWN'S ROADS YOU MIGHT NOT\nNOTICE THESE FLAT RIBBON CURBS.\nTHEY ALLOW WATER TO FLOW TO WHAT\nARE CALLED RAIN GARDENS, THEY'RE\nDESIGNED TO REPLICATE WHAT\nWETLANDS DO: HOLD AND FILTER\nWATER BEFORE IT FLOWS\nDOWNSTREAM.\n>> INSTEAD OF JUST ENGINEERING A\nSYSTEM TO WORK, WE'RE\nENGINEERING THE SYSTEM TO MIMIC\nNATURE, BECAUSE REALLY WHAT\nWE'VE LEARNED OVER TIME IS\nNATURE HAD IT RIGHT ALL ALONG.\n>> Sreenivasan: WICKS HAS WORKED\nON WATER ENGINEERING AT BABCOCK\nRANCH FOR MORE THAN A DECADE.\nSHE SAYS THIS LAND ONCE HAD\nSEASONAL LAKES BEFORE IT WAS\nDRAINED TO MAKE WAY FOR\nAGRICULTURE AND MINING.\n>> THIS HERE IS THE WEIR THAT\nWE'VE DESIGNED THAT'S GOING TO\nHOLD BACK THAT WATER TO MIMIC\nTHAT NATURAL SYSTEM THAT WAS\nHERE BEFORE, THAT NATURAL LAKE\nSYSTEM.\n>> Sreenivasan: NORTH OF TOWN A\nDITCH THAT JUST A YEAR AGO\nLOOKED LIKE THIS HAS BEEN\nTRANSFORMED.\n>> THIS NOW HOLDS WATER, ALMOST\nTHE ENTIRE YEAR.\nBACK TO WHAT THE NATURAL\nCONDITIONS WERE.\n>> Sreenivasan: AND WHAT BABCOCK\nRANCH IS DOING HERE HAS AN\nEFFECT ON NEARBY WATERWAYS.\nTOXIC ALGAE BLOOMS HAVE\nINCREASED IN FLORIDA.\nTHEY TURN WATERWAYS GREEN,\nSMELL, AND CAN AFFECT BOTH HUMAN\nAND MARINE ANIMAL HEALTH.\nTHE BLOOMS CAN NATURALLY OCCUR,\nBUT WORSEN WITH RUNOFF FROM\nAGRICULTURE AND DEVELOPMENT,\nINCLUDING FERTILIZER AND WASTE.\n>> WE'VE REALLY REALIZED THAT\nDEVELOPMENT HAS REALLY IMPACTED\nTHE WATER QUALITY IN THE STATE\nOF FLORIDA.\nSOMETHING LIKE THIS IS REALLY\nIMPORTANT JUST TO TRY TO REDUCE\nTHE OVERALL RUNOFF THAT'S GOING\nOUT TO OUR GULF ULTIMATELY, OUT\nTO OUR OCEANS.\n>> SOMETHING'S ALWAYS DOWNSTREAM\nFROM YOU AND YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE\nTHAT INTO ACCOUNT.\n>> Sreenivasan: WIN EVERHAM IS\nAN ECOLOGIST AT FLORIDA GULF\nCOAST UNIVERSITY.\nEARLY IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF\nBABCOCK RANCH, HE WAS CALLED IN\nTO HELP SURVEY THE WILDLIFE\nPOPULATION.\nAND HE'S FOLLOWED THE PROJECT'S\nDEVELOPMENT.\n>> WHAT WE KNOW WILL HAPPEN IN\nTHE FUTURE ON THIS LANDSCAPE IS\nMORE PEOPLE WILL WANT TO COME\nHERE.\nAND WHAT WE'RE REALLY LACKING IS\nBETTER MODELS FOR HOW TO PUT\nTHEM ON THE LAND.\nBABCOCK RANCH COULD BE A BETTER\nMODEL.\n>> Sreenivasan: BUT FOR ALL OF\nTHE TOWN'S SUSTAINABILITY\nFEATURES, THERE ARE GAPS.\nFOR EXAMPLE, MOST OF THE HOMES\nWILL BE SINGLE FAMILY.\n>> I THINK IT'S FAIR TO\nCRITICIZE SOME OF THE WAYS WE\nDEVELOP AND PART OF THE WAYS\nTHAT BABCOCK'S BEEN DEVELOPED\nTHAT THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY OF\nPUTTING PEOPLE ON THE LAND WOULD\nBE IN TALL APARTMENT BUILDINGS\nWHERE THE PEOPLE ARE\nCONCENTRATED AND YOU MAXIMIZE\nTHE GREEN SPACE.\n>> Sreenivasan: AND WHILE GREEN\nSPACE HAS BEEN SET ASIDE AT\nBABCOCK, AND THE AMOUNT OF GRASS\nEACH HOME CAN HAVE IS LIMITED,\nSOME HAVE ARGUED THE DEVELOPERS\nCOULD HAVE GONE FURTHER.\nFOR INSTANCE THEY COULD BAN\nLAWNS ALTOGETHER.\n>> WE'VE BEEN ASKED, YOU KNOW,\nWHY DON'T YOU JUST YOU KNOW SAY\nYOU CAN'T HAVE GRASS AT ALL AND\nYOU KNOW THE PRACTICALITY OF IT\nIS DIFFICULT.\nREMEMBER, WE DO HAVE TO SELL\nHOMES.\n>> Sreenivasan: KITSON SAYS\nHOMES ARE PRICED FOR DIFFERENT\nBUDGETS.\nTHEY START AT AROUND $200,000,\nSLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN THE MEDIAN\nFOR THIS PART OF FLORIDA AND CAN\nGO AS HIGH AS $1 MILLION.\nKITSON SAYS AFFORDABILITY AND\nSUSTAINABILITY ARE NOT\nNECESSARILY IN CONFLICT.\n>> WE NEED TO PROVE THAT\nBUILDING A SUSTAINABLE AND\nENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE NEW\nTOWN MAKES SENSE FROM AN\nECONOMIC PERSPECTIVE.\nNOT JUST FROM THE PEOPLE WHO ARE\nDEVELOPING IT LIKE US, BUT FOR\nTHE HOMEOWNERS WHO ARE GOING TO\nBUY HOMES AND MAKE THEIR\nINVESTMENTS WITHIN THE\nCOMMUNITY.\n>> Sreenivasan: BUT KITSON\nACKNOWLEDGES MAKING BABCOCK\nRANCH AS GREEN AS POSSIBLE IS\nSTILL A WORK IN PROGRESS.\n>> ARE WE 100% SUSTAINABLE RIGHT\nNOW?\nNO.\nBUT CAN WE GET THERE?\nABSOLUTELY.\n"
