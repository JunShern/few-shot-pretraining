    "text": "5/7/17\n\nThroughout the years I've been blogging, I've been keeping a record of the books my kids have gotten for their birthdays. This weekend my little one turned 14, and here's what he's got. I myself like to see what books other people get, and I think it's an interesting illustration of why picking \"books for an x-year-old kid\" is so futile an endeavor unless you really know the kid. CatStronauts: Mission Moon, and Race to Mars, by Drew Brockington. (these are graphic novels that are cute as all get out. I gave him a Catstronauts teeshirt a few years ago, and he wore it to pieces. These just came out, but I have known for months that he would be getting them).\n\nThe Northern Crusades, by Eric Christiansen (he wants to learn more about these, and very annoyingly I got rid of my own book about the Northern Crusades five or so years ago, which just goes to show that you should never get rid of any books ever. On the other hand, my book was probably out of date, and of course one should never offer inferior history to one's children.....Quite possible I will end up reading it and then telling him about it; my oral version will probably be more interesting. But in large part I bought it for him as a conscious act to show respect for his intellectual curiosity and capability).\n\nSpecial bonus and thanks to Clarion books (thanks!), Ghosts of Greenglass House, by Kate Milford (yay!). He wants to wait till Christmastime so I can read it out loud to him and his brother like I did for Greenglass House. Which would indeed be sweet seasonal warmth. But I will read it to myself long before then....\n\nNice to hear that kids are still getting books for birthday presents! These look like interesting books. I like to hear he wants to learn about the Crusades. Such an interesting chapter in history. Thanks for the post.\n\nHappy belated birthing-day to you! So many good books here! I'm so very excited to hear that another Greenglass House book is coming out! but I've put Catstronauts on hold in the meantime, and added the Manual of Aeronautics to my son's wishlist. He doesn't know about it, but would want it desperately."
