Counting from pinky to index, it is third. It will never be first or fourth (in a complete hand, anyway).\n\nI am the first. \nI'm no help in \"a way out.\" \nBut I'm first in these words: \"I\", \"don't\", \"know\".\n\nI missed this one entirely. See Matt's answer for the correct interpretation.\n\nI can't be left alone. \nIf I'm alone, I will offend someone. \n\nThe middle finger on its own is an insult.\n\nYou can't make peace if you cut me off. \n\nThe peace sign requires both the index and middle fingers.\n\nBut on the other hand, you might.\n\nI believe this is just a pun on \"hand\".\n\nA:\n\nI think it's\n\n Your middle finger \n\nReasoning:\n\nIt's either second or third, depending on if you start with the thumb or not.  The second clue is where the middle finger falls when typing.  The third clue - a middle finger alone is offensive, and if you cut off the middle finger on one hand, you can't make a peace sign, but then you can always make a peace sign with the other hand\n\n"
