You can get circuits into CNF form without expanding them exponentially by making up intermediate variables which represent the outputs of small sections of circuit.\nEach node of a circuit amounts to a=f(b, c) where a is the output, b and c the input, and f is some simple function like & or |. You can create a CNF function that is true only when a really is the result of f(b, c) and it can't be too unwieldy, because it is a function on only three variables.\nYou can rewrite any circuit into a large number of terms of the form a=f(b, c) and all you have to do with the CNF versions of these is to AND them all together. Assuming you want to solve for the output being true, you then just stick on the output variable as the final component of that big AND.\n\n"
