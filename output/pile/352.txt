And this is \u201cThe Argument.\u201d [MUSIC PLAYING] This week, get ready for impeachment.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nI don\u2019t think you can overemphasize just how abrupt the change has been. The dam sort of burst all at once.\n\ndavid leonhardt\n\nThen we talk about the 2020 primaries on the Republican side.\n\nross douthat\n\nAnyone who runs for president against an incumbent president who probably shouldn\u2019t be president deserves a certain amount of credit and admiration.\n\ndavid leonhardt\n\nAnd finally, a recommendation.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nI have had a feeling that I\u2019ve never had in the past, which is this desire to be in the future looking back analytically at right now. [MUSIC PLAYING]\n\ndavid leonhardt\n\nJust one week ago, it seemed highly unlikely that House Democrats would impeach President Trump. But then came the news about Trump\u2019s attempts to pressure Ukraine to produce dirt on Joe Biden. And suddenly, everything changed. This week, Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the house, who has long been opposed to impeachment, announced that she\u2019s going to open a process that could ultimately lead to the president\u2019s impeachment. Michelle, you\u2019ve been in favor of impeachment for a long time, and I know you\u2019ve been frustrated that it wasn\u2019t happening. But I assume now you think it really is likely to happen.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nYeah, I really do. And I think it\u2019s\u2014 I don\u2019t think you can overemphasize just how abrupt the change has been. The dam sort of burst all at once. I had a column calling out Nancy Pelosi for her failure to begin impeachment proceedings, and for her failure to do it after the Mueller Report, which I think emboldened Trump in his latest betrayal of the country with Ukraine. I had background conversations with people on both sides of this issue and got no sense, as of Monday morning, that there was any real movement. And then by Monday evening, impeachment had seemed inevitable.\n\ndavid leonhardt\n\nWell, I agree with you that it\u2019s likely to happen. And as regular listeners know, you and I\u2019ve been on different sides of this. I have previously thought impeachment would be a mistake. I thought it would have been a mistake after Mueller because I don\u2019t think it would have persuaded people who didn\u2019t already think Trump should be gone. Given that the Mueller Report was a letdown, we don\u2019t need to revisit that whole argument. I know you disagree, Michelle. But I think it\u2019s the right thing now, and I think it\u2019s really telling that a lot of these House Democrats, who don\u2019t just have to run in San Francisco or in New York City or in Massachusetts, but have to run in real swing districts are also coming out for it. Out of a combination of thinking, it\u2019s the right thing and also thinking the politics have changed. Ross, you are particularly good at throwing cold water on liberal excitement, and you did that again this week with your column arguing that President Trump actually wants to be impeached. I will confess I\u2019m a little skeptical of this particular tossing of cold water, so why don\u2019t you make that case?\n\nross douthat\n\nSo I don\u2019t know if this counts as cold water. I mean, just because the president wants something doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s actually good for him. What might be the things that Trump thinks he could get out of an impeachment fight? The first is, basically, that for now, impeachment is a lot less popular than the Democratic policy agenda. And so it shifts the conversation, maybe only temporarily, to terrain where the Democrats are doing something that a majority of the country doesn\u2019t necessarily want them to do. Two, I think Trump has benefited throughout his campaigns and presidency from this contrast between his overt corruption and the kind of business-as-usual corruption of the DC establishment, where he basically presents himself as sort of a man who\u2019s sort of honest about his cynicism and self-dealing, unlike the Clintons and the Clinton Foundation and the D.C. elite and the deep state and so on. And so I think he probably imagines that something similar could happen if we have a battle that sort of loops in everything Hunter Biden has ever done and the Biden family has ever done to profit off their family name. And then the third and fourth all sort of run together. I think that Trump has always delighted in watching Republicans who claim to have principles and honor bend the knee to him. And I think an impeachment battle might not, but is likely, to end with lots of Republicans who might be Trump\u2019s successor voting not to remove him from office. I think Trump likes these kind of highly personalized Twitter-ready battles in this primal way that I think even he maybe doesn\u2019t fully understand. I think there was part of the Mueller investigation that he enjoyed. I think there\u2019s part of an impeachment fight that he\u2019ll enjoy, maybe a little more because he can only be removed from office whereas Mueller could actually put his family in jail.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nSo first of all, I think that that kind of overrates\u2014 I mean, and your column gestures at that this too\u2014 that I don\u2019t think Trump thinks about things that logically or projects things into the future that much. I mean, he clearly has a drive towards chaos and destruction and overplaying his hands and always one-upping whoever he thinks he\u2019s up against. I really disagree that Trump enjoyed the Mueller investigation. He was more restrained during the Mueller investigation and became more unleashed afterwards. He\u2019s just been much more overtly lawless since the Mueller investigation ended, which suggests to me that the Mueller investigation worried him enough to provide some modest check on his criminality and corruption. And then finally, I think it was interesting to watch him give this speech at the U.N. As the dam was breaking and more and more Democrats were coming out for impeachment, it was this fascist speech that was delivered as if he had been tranquilized and was then reading from a phone book in, maybe, a foreign language. He seemed exhausted. He seemed deflated. And so, yeah. He might become energetic in battle, and he obviously drove himself to this point, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to be happy about where he has ended up, at least right now.\n\ndavid leonhardt\n\nRoss, I\u2019ll add one thing on that before you reply, which is I\u2019m not so sure that the conversation in the Democratic primary has been so good for the Democrats. I think it\u2019s really unfortunate. But many of them have come out for things that are unpopular, like taking away people\u2019s private health insurance or border decriminalization. And the only frontrunner who hasn\u2019t is Joe Biden, who\u2014\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\n\u2014and Pete Buttigieg.\n\ndavid leonhardt\n\n\u2014and Pete Buttigieg, who\u2019s now way, way back in the polls. So I don\u2019t think this campaign has been so great for the Democrats. And it\u2019s not clear to me that focusing people on Trump\u2019s misdeeds is actually so terrible.\n\nross douthat\n\nSo two things. First, to take the example you picked, David, where maybe this is better for the Democrats than focusing on the health care debate in their primaries. I think from his perspective, it could be a win-win because his theory might be that this helps take down Biden. Hunter Biden is emblematic of the kind of totally legal self-dealing that\u2019s really common in Washington, D.C. And so if Biden is associated with that, it helps Elizabeth Warren. So the end game is Trump gets impeached. He doesn\u2019t get removed from office. The impeachment helps elevate Warren. Warren is easier for Trump to beat. Trump feels victorious. That\u2019s another impeachment helping Trump scenario I could spin out. Now, I think everybody may be overestimating the political import of impeachment, that it could happen, and Trump could not be removed from office. And then in the time between impeachment and the election, 17 other controversies will cycle through. And it\u2019s not either going to be the game changer that impeachment advocates think or the debacle that I think Nancy Pelosi has been afraid of.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nI just want to say a couple of things. First of all, I think we need to be really, really careful to distinguish Hunter Biden and, quote, unquote, \u201cthe Biden family.\u201d There\u2019s a New Yorker piece that I hope people read about Hunter Biden, who is a really troubled man who has obviously done some sketchy things. But there is no evidence that his father has enabled any of that. Joe Biden was sort of troubled by some of the things that Hunter was doing but also just decided not to get involved.\n\ndavid leonhardt\n\nI\u2019m not sure that impeaching is a game changer, but Michelle, you\u2019ve really persuaded me, particularly at this point, that not impeaching now looks like a game changer. If Democrats look at this latest outrage by Trump and say, ah, just another one, that not only sends him a message that he can keep doing whatever he wants, but I actually think it brings political risk for the Democrats in terms of just making them look feckless.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nYeah, I mean, I also don\u2019t necessarily think that impeaching will be a game changer. I don\u2019t think we have any way of knowing how this is going to unfold. I know that some of the Democrats who have been against impeachment have worried that, yeah, what if we do this, he doesn\u2019t get removed, and then he just sits there for another eight months and feeling even more emboldened? But I do think that the failure to impeach \u2014 it both sends a message that the conduct that he\u2019s engaged in so far is not impeachable and is, therefore, somehow tolerable in a president. And I also do think it makes Democrats look overcautious, overcalculating. And when in doubt, just do the right thing.\n\ndavid leonhardt\n\nThe assumption all along has been that Senate Republicans will line up behind Trump and acquit him, just as they have lined up behind him on the vast majority of things during his presidency. Ross, do you think that should still be our working assumption? Or can you see a not ridiculous scenario in which Marco Rubio and some others start to think, wait a second, we\u2019ve got Mike Pence in waiting \u2014 I really don\u2019t want to define my career by defending this guy?\n\nross douthat\n\nI think it should be our default assumption that all but maybe one or two or three Republicans will stick with him. I think there\u2019s some space where something else could happen. And look. I mean, we don\u2019t have all the details at all. But the default here is just\u2014 this is a point I stole from Jonathan Last, a writer for the anti-Trump conservative site The Bulwark. But he was saying, look, the difference between Nixon and Trump is that Nixon was a man who belonged to the Republican Party, who believed in the Republican Party as an institution. And when Republicans in Congress went to Nixon and said, look, the game is up, they knew that Nixon would listen to them. Part of the bind that the Republicans are in is that what I think of as sort of the smartest and brightest Republican senators, the sort of range of younger senators that includes Rubio and Josh Hawley, and Ben Sasse and three or four others\u2014 all of these guys have long-term and short-term political ambitions that Trump himself can carpet-bomb from retirement after he\u2019s defeated. These guys are politicians. They\u2019re political animals. I can imagine getting a couple profiles in courage. I can\u2019t imagine getting anywhere near enough to get to \u2014 you don\u2019t just need 60. You need 67 votes in the Senate. That seems very hard.\n\ndavid leonhardt\n\nI do think there\u2019s some chance of a cascade, though.\n\nross douthat\n\nYeah. If you could get to 10 \u2014 maybe you could get to 20 \u2014 but getting from 2 to 10 is really hard.\n\ndavid leonhardt\n\nMichelle, you get the last word. Do you see a scenario where Republicans turn on him?\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nNo. Not absent some huge shift in public opinion, although, I mean, I do agree that there could be a cascade because it\u2019s not like any of these people like him. They hate him. My read on most Republicans is that they hate liberals far more than they love this country or that they love our Constitution. And I don\u2019t see that changing anytime soon. [MUSIC PLAYING]\n\ndavid leonhardt\n\nO.K. We\u2019ll leave it there. Something tells me this topic is going to dominate much of the next couple months of news, and we will be talking about it again. But for now, we will take a quick break and be right back. [MUSIC PLAYING] Their supporters call them the Three Musketeers. President Trump calls them the Three Stooges. They\u2019re the other Republicans running for president in 2020. Mark Sanford is a former governor and congressman from South Carolina. He supported Trump in 2016, but he is now one of Trump\u2019s biggest Republican critics.\n\narchived recording (mark sanford) I think we need to have a conversation there. I think we need to have a conversation on the degree to which institutions and political culture are being damaged by this president.\n\ndavid leonhardt\n\nThe next candidate, Joe Walsh, is a former Tea Party congressman from Illinois. He\u2019s somewhat of a Trumpist on Twitter. He has attacked the parents of Sandy Hook shooting victims and supported the lie that Barack Obama was a Muslim.\n\narchived recording (joe walsh) And I wouldn\u2019t call myself a racist, but I\u2019ve said racist things on Twitter. There\u2019s no doubt about it.\n\ndavid leonhardt\n\nFinally, Bill Weld. He\u2019s the former governor of Massachusetts, and he he\u2019s a classic moderate New England Republican.\n\narchived recording (bill weld) And we\u2019re now talking about trillion dollars of accumulated deficit. That raises a fairness issue to the young people, the millennials and Gen Xers who are going to have to pay that bill. I\u2019m not going to pay that bill.\n\ndavid leonhardt\n\nSo Ross, have any of these musketeers won your heart, and why do they matter?\n\nross douthat\n\nThey haven\u2019t won my heart. I find anyone who runs for president against an incumbent president who probably shouldn\u2019t be president deserves a certain amount of credit and admiration. I think that you have to temper that admiration with the realization that running for president in this way can also be a little bit of a grift. I think a lot of anti-Trump Republicans sort of watched a version of that happen with Evan McMullin, who ran this doomed third-party conservative campaign against Trump and then seemed determined to monetize it for the next two to four years. And I think someone like Walsh, who is sort of a professional bomb thrower \u2014 this gets him on cable news and gives him a different profile. Now, obviously, he\u2019s sort of torched his preexisting brand, so maybe he is exonerated from the grifting charge. All of these three guys have what you might call the sort of Marianne Williamson-versus-Oprah problem. They all represent different tendencies within the Republican Party \u2014 Rockefeller republicanism, Tea Party conservatism\u2014 without having the kind of profile or footprint necessary to be more than just cable news challengers to Trump, which is basically what they are right now. They\u2019re characters for MSNBC and CNN.\n\ndavid leonhardt\n\nI understand who Sanford is as a candidate and who Weld is. I don\u2019t totally understand what Walsh\u2019s game is because I get that he\u2019s more Trumpist than Sanford, but what\u2019s his problem with Trump?\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nHe pretty early on was getting frustrated on Twitter about Trump\u2019s evident bald-faced lies and also his deviations from conservative orthodoxy on all sorts of things, particularly his deviations from conservative economic orthodoxy. You saw this anger and opposition building over a long time. And I think there\u2019s something that happens with apostates, which is that as you were rejected from the world that sort of once defined you and that you once lived fully inside of, your entire worldview sort of shifts. And I think that that\u2019s what has happened with Joe Walsh out of maybe some combination of grift, principle, and social psychology.\n\nross douthat\n\nYeah. And you can make a case that Walsh is actually the closest thing to what you would really want in a primary challenger. I mean, that Sanford was the genuinely principled, small government, deficit cutting conservative who really believed in cut, cap, and balance and all these ideas that were sort of in vogue among the Tea Party intelligentsia circa 2010. And Walsh was the guy talking about Barack Obama\u2019s birthplace on Twitter. So for him to convert to anti-Trumpism is actually more interesting, and I think relevant, to where a lot of Republican voters might be, potentially.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nMy friend, Eyal Press, wrote this book called \u201cBeautiful Souls,\u201d which is basically about people who break ranks in all different kinds of circumstances. The point that he makes is that people who break ranks are often true believers who are truly disillusioned when the thing that they believe in doesn\u2019t live up to their ideals about it. It\u2019s the people who were most committed to Tea Party ideals and kind of conservative intellectual vision that have broken with Trump because he has set all that on fire.\n\ndavid leonhardt\n\nI don\u2019t disagree with that, but it leaves me thinking, really, that there is no clear post-Trump Republican Party because to the extent that any of these guys have a vision that actually coheres, like Bill Weld does, it\u2019s a vision that is based on an American public that doesn\u2019t exist. So it\u2019s just really unclear to me, now that Trump kind of called the lie on what the Republican Party was, that many Republican voters were not actually enamored of small government tax cuts. They\u2019re right wing on all kinds of things, but they\u2019re a little more populist. Now that he called the lie on that, it\u2019s just not at all clear to me what a Republican Party after Trump looks like that is real but also just doesn\u2019t have a ton of Trumpism still in it.\n\nross douthat\n\nBecause Trump is popular within the Republican Party, because the economy is good, because he has not presided over major foreign policy catastrophes, it\u2019s very hard for any politician who wants to have a career after Trump to talk themselves into running against him. The shape of the Republican Party after Trump \u2014 I mean, who knows for sure \u2014 but I think you can see the outline of a pretty clear debate. You\u2019ll have people in a zone between Mike Pence and Nikki Haley, who sort of want to go back to where the party was before Trump and pretend nothing has changed. And then you have people like Rubio and Josh Hawley who want to remake the party in a more populist direction, adapt to whatever Trump has revealed. But both of those groups\u2014 they want Trump to go away, but they\u2019re afraid of what Trump can do to their plans for the Republican Party in 2024 or 2028. So you\u2019re left with the ideologies of the past. Basically, all that\u2019s missing here, really \u2014 we need John Bolton. He\u2019s not a neoconservative technically, but he\u2019s certainly a foreign policy hawk. You could add the sort of uber hawk primary challenger, and then you\u2019d have the whole range of versions of Republicanism past that Trump defeated. And Bolton as a primary challenger would be more interesting, certainly, than the three that we have right now.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nI mean, there\u2019s very \u2014 it seems to me that there is very little appetite in either party for big, new foreign invasions. I mean, thank goodness. The thing that I don\u2019t understand\u2014 or maybe I do understand\u2014 but there\u2019s such a lack of vision. It\u2019s like, do any of these people remember what happened to George W. Bush? I mean, George W. Bush, much more than Trump, was venerated across the Republican Party. I mean, they worshipped George W. Bush. It was grotesque. And then it all collapsed so quickly. And it\u2019s very easy for me to imagine a version of the future 10 years from now, where Dinesh D\u2019Souza, or the heir to Dinesh D\u2019Souza, who\u2019s like a kind of right-wing, revisionist historian troll, insists that, no, Trump was never actually a Republican. He was always really a Democrat. And they basically try to pretend that none of this ever really happened. There\u2019s such an opportunity for the person who stakes out that anti-Trump position in the same way that Trump benefited from what was, at the time, very impolitic criticism of George W. Bush.\n\nross douthat\n\nSee, I think \u2014 so two things. One, Michelle\u2019s future \u2014 you also have to have the mirror image, which is that there\u2019ll be the liberal pundits who are saying, man, there\u2019s nothing worse than President Tucker Carlson and Vice President Peter Thiel and if only we could get back to the civilized republicanism of the Donald Trump era.\n\ndavid leonhardt\n\nMichelle and I hereby promise never to say that, and you can hold us to it, Ross.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nWell, I don\u2019t know. I also said\u2014 I remember\u2014 can I just say quickly, I remember during George W. Bush\u2019s administration saying, my god, can you imagine if there\u2019s ever a world in which we\u2019re looking back nostalgically about George W. Bush?\n\nross douthat\n\nThe other point, though, is that Trump came along and attacked George W. Bush\u2019s record in 2016, when nobody else was willing to do it. And it helped him. But he did it eight years after the fact. Donald Trump was not making his critique of George W. Bush in real time. He made it long after the fact when many Republican voters had sort of come around to this view. And watching Trump\u2019s rise has given me a pretty low opinion of Republican politicians, so I\u2019m not surprised that you don\u2019t have profiles in courage. And I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s some long-term upside for a would-be future leader of the Republican Party in opposing Trump directly right now.\n\ndavid leonhardt\n\nWell, in this absurd political era, I think we should end this with a little bit of absurdity, which is these candidates who are running against Trump are going to run into an obstacle that previous presidential candidates have not run into, at least recently, which is the Republican Party is now so in thrall to Donald Trump that in at least four states\u2014 Alaska, Nevada, South Carolina, and Kansas\u2014 party leaders in the state have voted to cancel their presidential nominating contests in 2020 to make sure they can award their delegates to Donald Trump. [MUSIC PLAYING] Now it\u2019s time for our weekly recommendation, when we make a suggestion that is meant to take your mind off of the day\u2019s headlines. I\u2019m going to cheat just a little bit here but make a recommendation that is not on the news but related to the news. And I\u2019m going to encourage our listeners to go study up on Watergate history because it suddenly seems to have a new relevance. I am going to specifically recommend the podcast \u201cSlow Burn\u201d by Leon Neyfakh, which tracks the Nixon impeachment process and his resignation. But if you\u2019ve already listened to that, I\u2019m going to encourage you to dig into a book, like \u201cFinal Days\u201d by Woodward and Bernstein, or, really, any Watergate history that you find appealing. First of all, it\u2019s just super enjoyable. And second of all, I think it\u2019ll leave you with some humility about our being able to forecast exactly what\u2019s going to happen. We look back on Watergate, and we think it\u2019s this nice, tidy thing in which President Nixon broke the law and got removed from office. But anyone who lived through it remembers that that\u2019s not at all the way it happened. And it wasn\u2019t clear at all from the beginning that he was going to get removed from office.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nYeah. I mean, I absolutely would second your recommendation for \u201cSlow Burn.\u201d And I have had, since this whole thing started, a feeling that I\u2019ve have never had in the past, which is this desire to be in the future looking back analytically at right now.\n\ndavid leonhardt\n\nIn part because it means we\u2019re not living through the Trump presidency anymore, I\u2019m sure.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nRight. Exactly. But I\u2019ve never sort of wanted a historical era to end so desperately. And so there is a certain amount of comfort in seeing that they were sort of stumbling in the dark, but then, ultimately, history moved forward, and at least other generations were able to make sense of it all.\n\ndavid leonhardt\n\nRoss, have you listened to \u201cSlow Burn?\u201d No. I don\u2019t listen to any podcast other than \u201cThe Argument,\u201d David. And indeed\u2014 \u2014 on repeat?\n\nross douthat\n\n\u2014I feel that you\u2019ve doubly violated our rules by making an on-the-news recommendation and recommending a rival podcast.\n\ndavid leonhardt\n\nTotally fair. Well my recommendation is \u201cSlow Burn,\u201d specifically the first season of the podcast\u2014 Slow Burn, which covers the Nixon impeachment and resignation.
