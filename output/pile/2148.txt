    "text": "Bill O\u2019Reilly in 2015 on the set of \u201cThe O'Reilly Factor\u201d in New York. (Brendan McDermid/Reuters)\n\nFox News and its star host Bill O\u2019Reilly appear to have developed a strategy in response to allegations of serial sexual harassment and the mass defections of advertisers from O\u2019Reilly\u2019s program: Say as little as possible.\n\nThe voluble TV personality has said nothing on the air about the controversy since it broke over the weekend. Fox News has all but ignored any reporting about it in its broadcasts and on its website; its one acknowledgment was a 25-second summary on its \u201cMedia Buzz\u201d program on Sunday. It has not mentioned the advertiser reaction.\n\nFox\u2019s parent company, meanwhile, has confined its comments to a brief statement issued Saturday saying, in part, that it \u201ctakes matters of workplace behavior very seriously.\u201d\n\nDozens of advertisers have suspended their sponsorship of O\u2019Reilly\u2019s top-rated program, \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor,\u201d since the story broke that O\u2019Reilly and Fox have settled five claims that he harassed women at Fox, paying out $13 million since 2002. A sixth woman, who has not sought payment, said she, too, was pressured for sex by O\u2019Reilly and was punished at Fox when she refused.\n\nFox News\u2019s only statement on the matter was one issued Tuesday from its top ad executive, Paul Rittenberg, who said ads withdrawn from \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor\u201d would be moved to other Fox programs.\n\n(Erin Patrick O'Connor/The Washington Post)\n\nThe network declined again Thursday to respond to questions. Fox\u2019s parent, 21st Century Fox, did not respond at all when asked for comment.\n\nThe takeaway from Fox\u2019s non-response isn\u2019t clear. On one hand, the lack of supportive statements for O\u2019Reilly could reflect official disapproval, while Fox has shown no outward signs that it has disciplined O\u2019Reilly or that it intends to punish its biggest star.\n\nConversely, the blanket of silence could represent the best of a series of bad options. By not responding publicly, O\u2019Reilly, Fox and 21st Century may be hoping that the attention surrounding the issue will eventually subside.\n\nSo far, O\u2019Reilly\u2019s audience has not only stuck with him \u2014 it has grown. \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor\u201d attracted 3.8 million viewers Tuesday night, according to Nielsen, a 20 percent increase over the program\u2019s ratings a week before and 19 percent more than on the same date last year.\n\nO\u2019Reilly\u2019s silence in this instance stands in stark contrast to the last time he was the story. After Mother Jones magazine published a piece in 2015 questioning O\u2019Reilly\u2019s claims about reporting on the Falkland Islands war in the early 1980s, O\u2019Reilly mounted an aggressive campaign to rebut the article\u2019s premise.\n\nIn various interviews with reporters, he called the story \u201cslander\u201d and labeled its principal author, David Corn, \u201ca liar\u201d and \u201ca guttersnipe\u201d who should be put in \u201cthe kill zone.\u201d O\u2019Reilly also warned a New York Times reporter, Emily Steel, that if the Times\u2019 coverage of the topic was inaccurate or inappropriate, he would be \u201ccoming after you with everything I have. You can take it as a threat.\u201d (Steel was an author of the Times story, published Saturday, about O\u2019Reilly\u2019s harassment settlements.)\n\nO\u2019Reilly\u2019s attack on Corn and other journalists in 2015 did not quell the controversy, however. News organizations soon dug up other instances in which O\u2019Reilly had exaggerated his exploits as a reporter.\n\nFor Fox, the current controversy is complicated by its connection to a larger scandal about the network \u2014 the sexual-harassment allegations that led to the ouster of its chairman, Roger Ailes, last year.\n\nGiven that context, O\u2019Reilly and Fox may have no choice but to keep mum now lest they remind people of the earlier scandal, Corn said.\n\n\u201cO\u2019Reilly lives to fight,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in this instance, who\u2019s he going to attack? The women? Anything he can say would only elongate the newsiness of this scandal. His only play is to hope this passes. It must make him very, very sad that there\u2019s no one for him to insult here.\u201d\n\n(O\u2019Reilly addressed the issue Saturday in a brief statement portraying himself as a target of opportunistic people.)\n\nCrisis management experts, however, say silence is rarely a good idea in the midst of controversy.\n\nMichael Fineman, who heads a crisis-counseling company, advises clients in such situations to put out all the facts at once, take responsibility for the controversy, express concern for those affected and make assurances of reform.\n\nIn this case, that may mean Fox should remove O\u2019Reilly from the air, temporarily or permanently, said Steven Fink, the author of \u201cCrisis Communications: The Definitive Guide to Managing the Message.\u201d Fink said NBC News sent a strong and reassuring signal to viewers and nervous advertisers in 2015 by suspending anchor Brian Williams for six months after finding that he exaggerated various stories.\n\n\u201cAs long as O\u2019Reilly\u2019s on the air, I don\u2019t think this story will die,\u201d Fink said. \u201cIn an era of social media, there are enough people who will not let this go by quietly.\u201d\n\nBut Eric Dezenhall, a Washington-based communications counselor, said Fox and O\u2019Reilly have very few choices. \u201cCrisis management is the art of navigating abominable options,\u201d said Dezenhall, who has appeared on O\u2019Reilly\u2019s show. \u201cThe question is not whether silence is the best option. It is a question of it being the least awful option given a variety of variables we just don\u2019t know about as outsiders.\u201d"
