Adding to the muddle are the many exceptions to the rules that are just plain maddening. But understanding grammar is essential for students to speak and write with competence and clarity.\n\n_Practice Makes Perfect: Exploring Grammar_ can be a valuable resource in learning grammar.

Tip sheets throughout the book highlight grammatical facts and rules, while self-correcting worksheets provide students with an interesting way to learn and practice grammar skills.\n\nLearning grammar is challenging.

Along with a subject, every sentence must have a verb.\n\nThe following tip sheets and worksheets focus on verbs and verb usage.

Finally, Worksheets 3.26 through 3.29 provide reviews of verbs.\n\n### **TIP SHEET  \nTwo Kinds of Verbs**\n\nThere are two kinds of verbs in English: action and linking.\n\n\u2022 An _action verb_ tells what the subject of a sentence does or did.\n\nAnthony plays the drums in the school band.\n\nElena watched a scary movie last night.\n\nThe deer ran across the field.\n\n\u2022 A _linking verb_ links, or connects, the subject of a sentence with a noun or adjective in the predicate. A word that follows a linking verb names or describes the subject. Forms of the verb _be\u2014am_ , _is_ , _are_ , _was_ , _were_ , _being_ , and _been_ \u2014are linking verbs.\n\nLindsay was happy.\n\nJoe is a great soccer player.\n\nI am thirsty.\n\n\u2022 Other verbs such as _appear_ , _become_ , _feel_ , _grow_ , _sound_ , _seem_ , _look_ , and _taste_ can also be linking verbs. To be linking verbs, these verbs must be able to take the place of a form of the verb _be_ in a sentence.\n\nMegan seemed shocked.\n\nMegan was shocked.\n\nThe kittens look sleepy.\n\nThe kittens are sleepy.\n\n\u2022 A verb that contains more than one word is called a _verb phrase_. The last word in the phrase is the _main verb_. All other words in the phrase are _helping verbs_. There are many helping verbs. Here are some of the most common: _am_ , _are_ , _is_ , _was_ , _were_ , _be_ , _have_ , _has_ , _had_ , _do_ , _does_ , _did_ , _will_ , _would_ , _shall_ , _should_ , _can_ , _could_ , _may_ , _might_.\n\nKim is studying for her math test.\n\nBryan has finished his science report.\n\nWe will be going to Europe this summer.\n\n#### **3.1 Author of a Classic Story**\n\nP.

One tip sheet and Worksheet 7.9 focus on _coordinating conjunctions_.\n\nAn _interjection_ is a word that shows feeling or emotion. One tip sheet and Work-sheet 7.10 focus on interjections.\n\nPart 7 concludes with Worksheets 7.11 through 7.13, which review prepositions, conjunctions, and interjections, and Worksheet 7.14, which reviews parts of speech.\n\n### **TIP SHEET  \nPrepositions**\n\nA _preposition_ is a word that relates a noun or pronoun to another word in a sentence.

Words like _accept_ and _except_ , _good_ and _well_ , and _lay_ and _lie_ are easy to mix up. Even if you understand the meanings of these words, you may make mistakes with them if you are not careful. Because these words, and words like them, are easily confused, they may slip into your speaking and writing. You can avoid making usage mistakes by (1) understanding the meanings of easily confused words, and (2) proofreading your written work with care.\n\nThe tip sheets and worksheets that follow focus on word usage and proofreading. The first tip sheet identifies several of the most easily confused words, and Work-sheets 9.1 through 9.4 provide practice in recognizing and using these words correctly.
