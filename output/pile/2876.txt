This is just some random guy on the\ninternet who snagged the GitHub username \"systemdaemon\".\n\nHave a look here:\n[https://github.com/systemdaemon](https://github.com/systemdaemon)\n\nA profile created two weeks ago, with a single repository, 0 stars and 1\ncommit over its entire lifetime.\n\nThis is a transparant hoax, and I don't understand how Distrowatch (and the HN\ncommunity) has not seen through it yet...\n\n~~~\n616c\nThanks for shedding real data on the issue. I was skeptical myself. I checked\nout Poettering's Google+ profile and see no mention of this yet, and I was\nkind of surprised.\n\n------\n616c\nI am kind of disappointed that there is some baity qualities to this article,\nspecifically referencing how Linus chewed out a systemd developer. He did\nthat, but I recall it not being directly related to his work on systemd and it\nnegatively impacting the kernel. Kay Sievers is a well-known problem causer as\nLinus is concerned, so this is not news.\n\nKeep in mind if you find the mailing list thread referred to, Greg Hartmann\n(gregkh), the release maintainer of the Linux kernel, arguably part of the\ninner echelons, is responsible for the kdbus branch eventually getting merged\ninto the mainline kernel, that is the kernel driver that will internalize dbus\nas a main (if not only) IPC of the kernel and reducing the overheard of using\ndbus now (reducing 12 operations per dbus call to 3 inside the kdbus driver,\nIIRC from Lennart's video). Again, this is the work of Lennart Poettering\npulseaudio fame, and now much more heated systemd fame. So to pretend the\nLinux kernel is opposed systemd work is not truthful. Some core devs have\ntaken it on and are staking themselves on it. If this gregkh tidbit does not\nmake that obvious I do not know what does.\n\nCan someone who knows more comment on what the substantive changes are thus\nfar? Is the kdbus work a prime motivator of this? I love systemd hate as much\nas the next guy, but I was hoping we would get more facts from the HN crowd.\n\n(EDIT: I know I will get downvoted, but I do use systemd and I am not its\nbiggest fan; I just used Arch and got used to it; everyone has a right to\nchoose their tools, and init systems ain't different.)\n\n------\nthaumaturgy\nDebian forums concludes it's a joke too:\n\n[http://forums.debian.net/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=121167](http://forums.debian.net/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=121167)\n\n _sigh_ Guess my news blackout period is gonna have to start extending from\nMarch 30 to April 2 now.\n\nLame.\n\n------\njoosters\nThey're planning on getting rid of NetworkManager, so they can't be\n_completely_ evil :-)\n\n~~~\ndigi_owl\nBah, sounds like a cure worse than the disease.\n\n------\nraverbashing\nHere's a group that can take criticism nicely...\n\nLet's feign surprise.\n\nOf course the kernel is GPL and forking is allowed, but I have yet to see such\nan idiotic case of tail wagging the dog.\n\nMaybe the guy that wanted to \"prove\" he's better at managing the Redis than\nAntirez is a strong contest\n\n------\nfsniper\nApril fools or the real intension faces water at last?\n\n~~~\nnetworked\n>[...] According to Ivan Gotyaovich, one of the developers working on\nsystemd[...]\n\nI'd say it's a prank but I don't think it's April 1st anywhere in the world\nyet.\n\n~~~\ndigi_owl\nA quick search comes up blank on that name.\n\n~~~\npalmer_eldritch\nJust a quick note about that name \"Ivan Gotyaovich\": Got ya! -ovitch.\n\nIt sounds much more like a prank than a real name.\n\n~~~\nslikts\nYeah, there's no such surname as \"\u0413\u043e\u0442\u044f\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447\"; it's made up.\n\n------\nsimgidacav\nThe fork won't last long I guess...\n\n------\nhias\nso they finally jumped the shark ;-)\n\n"
