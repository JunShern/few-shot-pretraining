    "text": "New research published in PLoS ONE says that horses have a variety of facial expressions (even if they\u2019re not all distinctive to us) and use them when communicating with other horses.\n\nCreationist Ken Ham knows why that is: Because God created horses. (Obviously.)\n\nHam writes:\n\nIn a creation worldview this new research makes sense. God created many animals with the ability to communicate with one another through facial expression, gestures, or song\u2026 \u2026 \u2026 But then the researchers in the PLOS ONE journal say \u201cThe potential to make such cross species comparisons can enhance our understanding of the meaning, function, and evolution of communicative behavior\u201d (emphasis added). Clearly, they are trying to align such expressions with those of humans and other animals based on the belief that horses and humans are related because of progression in their evolutionary belief system. This is not observational science. \u2026 \u2026 Humans, horses, and other animals do not use similar facial muscles and communicative expressions because of shared ancestry, but they do share a common Designer and so we would expect to see similarities in living things \u2014 and we observe that.\n\nLook: In a \u201ccreation worldview,\u201d everything makes sense because 1) There\u2019s no scientific standard you have to meet and 2) The audience is too ignorant to argue otherwise.\n\nIt rained in Chicago last night. I could give you the scientific reasons for that. But why bother when Ham will tell you God is just crying over the legalization of gay marriage? In his world, no research is complete without mentioning God, and God\u2019s presence in a \u201cresearch\u201d article makes anything the authors say automatically true. (Just once, I\u2019d love to see a rejection letter by the folks who put together the Answers in Genesis research journal. Because they\u2019ll accept anything if you use the right Creationist buzzwords.)\n\nThere are theories for how smiling developed that don\u2019t include \u201cGod did it.\u201d Ham\u2019s crack research team didn\u2019t bother looking into any of that.\n\nMaybe that\u2019s because their petting zoo (a.k.a. the Creation Museum\u2019s research lab) offers everything you ever need to know about the subject:\n\nYou can learn more about the horse kind when you visit the Creation Museum here in northern Kentucky. We have a zorse and a zonkey in our petting zoo that show visitors that horses, donkeys, and zebras are all part of one created kind, the horse kind.\n\nThe \u201chorse kind.\u201d\n\nBecause you can\u2019t say \u201cbullshit\u201d at a petting zoo.\n\n\n\n"
