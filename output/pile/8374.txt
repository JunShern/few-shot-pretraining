    "text": "Tuesday, January 04, 2011\n\nUNTO THE HILLS by Billy Graham\n\nUNTO THE HILLS\nA Daily Devotional\nby\nBilly Graham\nPublished by Thomas Nelson Publishers\n\nThis is an updated version of the book reissued on the 25th anniversary of the original. There is a devotional\ndevoted to each day of the year, with a Bible verse at the top and a short prayer at the end of each. I think this is the best way to understand some of the Bible, for those of us who need to delve more deeply into the word of God, but don't take the time to read daily. I am really enjoying the devotionals, and his Preface, he says he never picks up the book without thinking of his late wife, Ruth, and knows that soon, they will be reunited, but until then, he is dedicating the book to her memory.\n\nI have a very hefty respect for Dr. Graham, so when I got a chance to review this book, I jumped at it. I seldom reread a book, but this one will stay by my chair, as it seems to touch on many subjects, I can read it and understand his explainations in just a few minutes time. And with the verse at the top of the page, if you want to go more in depth, you have a location to start reading.\n\nI received a copy of this book from BookSneeze to read and review. I recieved no other compensation for my review. All opinions expressed here are my own.\n\nNo comments:\n\nFollow by Email\n\nFeedjit\n\nPages\n\nDisclaimer\n\nIn accordance with the new FTC Guidelines for blogging and endorsements, you should assume that every book reviewed here at Jettie's Ramblings was provided to the reviewer, by the publisher, media group or the author for free. no financial compensation was received, unless specified on the review..All opinions expressed are my own.\nNow about me..I'm a wife, mom, grandmom, and I'm a 'crafty person'. The girls used to refer to my 'crafts' as my hobby of the month. I finally found soapmaking and floral design, and those I've stuck with for more than a month, florals for about 8 yrs, soapmaking for 6 yr. I also like writing, I've self published 1 book with a co author, A Man Called Brown, abt my gggrandfather, and written several short stories for the entertainment of myelf and a few friends."
