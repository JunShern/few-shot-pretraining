That is not the right solution, and it is against our forum rules to own multiple accounts.\n\nSerionsly guys, are you going to keep on and on trashing the game till the end of times ?\nWe know you're dissapointed of this reboot.\n\nI was in the same situation regarding the new Soul Calibur.\nThough I choose not to lose time on the forum hating all over the place.\n\nIMO, DMC4 could be as well criticized : Dante not being the lead character, having to go all the way back with him as an \"after-game\"... It's like a spin-off + a bonus Dante.\n\nI'm not a fan of the franchise so I can't really complain.\nBut the wig scene is to me hilarious. It's pure trolling from Capcom so I do understand the hate coming from that. But let's be honest, I don't think having boots and long hair was badass to begin with. So yeah, hilarious.\n\nSerionsly guys, are you going to keep on and on trashing the game till the end of times ?\n\nNot all people in this thread is trashing the game. Some people even game the game a chance. The Reboot is solid and have a lot of positive scores and a higher rating than that mediocre Devil may cry 4 whose only positive thing is the gameplay.\n\nI can understand why some people are disappointed in this game too. Alex jones keeps saying that the gameplay is \"evolved\". Certainly at the basic levels, it had evolved, it had more freedom and accessibility than any Hack n' slash game but by \"evolved\" means toping DMC 3 or 4's Advanced combat(Which at this point, i still don't know).\n\nAlso, the Story. Ninja theory is known for it's Storytelling in Heavenly Sword and especially Enslaved. Thing is, the writer in those games and here in DmC is different. While the story in this reboot is the most understandable, it felt way too anti-climatic in the end and the pacing is draggy. I also think the character development of Dante is way too early in the game.\n\nIf there would ever be a DmC 2, i'm hoping the next developer will do better. If it only sell well and if Crapcom thinks that it's worthy enough to be a series again.\n\nSerionsly guys, are you going to keep on and on trashing the game till the end of times ?\n\nPointing out the flaws and major/minor errors of a game, as well as the broken promises of it's developers (not to mention their insufferable attitude) is not considered 'trashing'.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by Vladrave\n\nNot all people in this thread is trashing the game.

Definitely getting it next week.\n\n1. Lacking in depth? Yeah.... Color code enemies restrict gameplay? A half of yes.\n2.Platforming is way better than any DMC game and clearly more unique. Glithces? Who cares about glitches? Skyrim was released with full of glitches yet was universally acclaimed. Your point? Also, it doesn't hinder you from the full experience sooo..\n3.Cool.\n4.Yeah, but this is one is way better.\n5. Want me to get to the point? DMC 4's storytelling is garbage. Also yeah you're right. Bleach doesn't have any major love arc of what ever it is.\n6.Reuben langdon is the iconic VA of dante\n7. Does that mean DMC 4 is not fun without bloody palace? Ha!\nlol JK\n\n1. Lacking in depth?

Does that mean DMC 4 is not fun without bloody palace? Ha!\nlol JK\n\nToo lazy to Multiquote soooo.....\n\n2. Doesn't make it right. So you would pay full price for unfinished game? Also, Skyrim was a HUGE open world game, DmC is a single player game and they still can't get it right?(Also, the whole pulling mechanic was done with Nero as well so it's not that unique)\n\n4. But the other one is prettier.\n\n6. Just making a pun\n\n__________________\n\n~\"I think 'DINOSAUR' might be one of my favorite words for a punchline.\"~\n\nI have a question. If this DMC had Dante living 3 or so years under Mundus' cronies who were beating the ever loving crap out of him, how come they didn't just kill him then? It's not like they hate him that much to put him through extended damnation. A year, two tops then just lop his head off? He's an abberration considered something unwanted, you'd think they would burn him to ashes the chance they get instead of letting him rot.\n\nThe revisionism being exhibited by reviewers and a lot of \"anti-haters\" is pretty fucking depressing, I gotta say. (It's really awful when you consider, oh, Kotaku's treatment of the recent Ubisoft titles as compared to their treatment of this. Capcom must have paid them more.)\nI don't want to play DmC and probably never will, and while I can understand why it would appeal to some people I doubt its myriad problems that have been pointed out ad infinitum long before release have suddenly vanished.\n\nI have a question.
