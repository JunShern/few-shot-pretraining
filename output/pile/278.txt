It was a fascinating lecture, and I must admit that up until then I had known very little about the Late Period tombs in this area, so the talk was a true eye opener for me.\nThe renaissance, or Archaic Revival, of the Late Period has long held a fascination for me, and it\u2019s normally something I think of as having been \u201ckicked off\u201d \u2013 as it were \u2013 by the Pharaohs of the 26th Dynasty. But these classical Saite signatures, such as the passion for (exquisitely executed!) scenes in the Old Kingdom traditions, and even the inclusion of parts of the Pyramid Texts, can be seen in Harwa\u2019s tomb (TT37, El Assasif) at the height of the 25th Dynasty.\nHarwa was the Great Steward of the Adoratrice of Amun, during the reign of Taharqa, and possibly acted as a vassal ruler of the south under him, since the Pharaohs of the 25th Dynasty remained in Nubia and only held power through the Priesthood of Amun, hence Harwa\u2019s great importance. The scale of his tomb would indeed suggest this, for although it\u2019s layout is entirely different, in it\u2019s ambitious design, and in the quality of carving, it is certainly the equal of some royal tombs.\nSadly, time has been unkind to Harwa\u2019s eternal home. Only fragments of the decoration survive, having been re-used for subsequent burials during the Late period, and functioning as a chapel to Osiris in Ptolemaic times. Dr Tiradritti also presented some of the tombs later history that had been unearthed during excavations, including an earlier Italian visit to the tomb by soldiers during the Second World War, leaving behind part of a biscuit packet for future generations.\nThankfully, the team have been able to take advantage of changes in technology over the long course of their work so far (excavation began in 1995, and there is still much work to be done) and this has allowed maps, images and also a complete catalogue of decorative fragments found to be made available on an online database. This has also allowed for digital reconstructions of numerous wall scenes to be made, allowing a much better understanding of the tombs original design.\nA multi-lingual web portal has now been online for ten years, and is available at http://www.Harwa.it/ \u201dhttp://pavementsofsilver.wordpress.com/2008/07/13/the-tomb-of-harwa/trackback/\n\n\u201cAn end and a beginning\n\nOn March 23, 2007 the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art opens at the Brooklyn Museum. To celebrate the opening and the accompanying exhibition, \u201cPharaohs, Queens and Goddesses\u201d, we decided to devote the last posting of the 2007 season at the Mut Precinct to some of the female figures, mortal and divine, associated with the site.\n\nHatshepsut being crowned by Amun-Re and granted life and dominion by the goddess \u201cGreat in Magic\u201d, from the reconstructed Red Chapel in the Karnak Open Air Museum. An early 18th Dynasty temple at Mut dates to the reign of this woman who ruled as king.\n\n\u201cGod\u2019s Wife of Amun\u201d was an important female priestly title in Thebes. In the 1st millennium BC it was usually held by a sister or daughter of the reigning king, each God\u2019s Wife adopting her successor. They became so powerful that they were able to have themselves represented in roles normally played by the king.\n\nIn scenes of goddesses suckling humans, the human is normally the king, with the scene representing the transfer of life and power. Yet in this scene in the Chapel of Osiris-Ruler-of-Eternity at Karnak, not only is the God\u2019s Wife of Amun, Shepenwepet I, being suckled, she is also wearing 2 Double Crowns, something shown nowhere else in any period.\n\nIn her funerary chapel at the temple of Medinet Habu, Amunirdis makes offerings to Amun and Hathor. The presence of funerary chapels to mortals within the sacred grounds of a temple is rare until the Third Intermediate Period, a time when God\u2019s Wives of Amun flourished.\n\nIntangible concepts could also be represented as goddesses. In a scene commemorating an important military campaign by Sheshonq I of Dynasty 22, the goddess \u201cVictorious Thebes\u201d, carrying a mace, an axe and a bow, drags conquered cities (shown as bound prisoners with the city names enclosed in cartouches representing fortified walls) to be slaughtered.\n\nUpper and Lower Egypt were represented as the goddesses Nekhbet (right) and Wadjet. Scenes of the king flanked by these protective deities are common in all periods of Egyptian history. This one comes from the Mut Precinct\u2019s Ptolemaic Chapel D.\n\nKeeping Mut and Sakhmet happy was a main function of the Mut priesthood. In this scene from the Mut Precinct\u2019s main entrance the king (holding Hathor-headed sistra) and two priestesses play music to Mut and Sakhmet to amuse them and keep them contented.\n\nTwo busts of Sakhmet in the Mut Precinct. Sakhmet angered could release disease and disaster on Egypt. Contented she could control these forces, which is why she is a goddess of health and healing as well as of death and destruction.\n\nThese 3 reliefs of Mut span a period of several hundred years. On the left is a relief from Amunirdis\u2019s funerary chapel at Medinet Habu; in the center a relief from the chapel of Osiris-Ruler-of-Eternity at Karnak; and on the right a relief in Chapel D at the Mut Precinct. In all three scenes Mut appears in her usual guise of a human wearing the Double Crown.\n\nAnd finally, a stela of a king offering to Mut that we uncovered in 2006. While the stela is uninscribed, it is entirely possible that it dates to the reign of the Roman Emperor Tiberius, showing that Mut continued as an important goddess even after Egypt\u2019s conquest by Rome.\n\nHarwa was an important man in ancient Egypt. He was an important figure in the life of Amenirdis I of ancient Egypt\u2019s XXV Dynasty. He acted as the \u2018Chief Steward\u2019, or \u2018Grand Steward\u2019 for Amenirdis I, as God\u2019s Wife of Amun and also whilst Queen Amenirdis served as Divine Adoratrice. Additionally, he held the title (as High Priest) of \u201cDoorkeeper in the Temple of Amun\u201d.\n\nBorn in to a family of Theban Priests, Harwa held high office in Thebes (modern-day Luxor) with great responsibility to Amun and God\u2019s Wife of Amun, the Divine Votaress, Amenirdis I. He was son of the \u201cLady of the House\u201d, Nestaureret, and of a Priest attached to the temple of Amun in Karnak, Padimut son of Ankhefenamon.\n\nHis tomb is located in el-Assasif, part of the Theban Necropolis, near to Deir el-Bahri and is known as TT37 (Theban Tomb 37) which has been under archaeological examination for some years and currently not accessible to the public.\n\nThe tomb of Harwa (TT37) displays important features of a man holding such religious, spiritual and political power. Scenes and texts \u2013 at least those engraved in the principal axis of the monument \u2013 can be read as part of a description of the Egyptian man\u2019s journey from his daily life to the Netherworld, passing through the ultimate experience of death and beyond. Each part of the monument concurs to document a different step of the path leading to eternal life.\nThe tomb (TT37) is large and in the \u201cOsiris Hall\u201d there is a wall relief describing the moment of the death where Harwa is shown \u2018between worlds\u2019, and separated from his physical body, with Anubis holding one hand. Harwa then exists in two dimensions \u2013 in the Land of Osiris and still in the land of the living, just. Harwa\u2019s tomb shows the moment of death in its supreme glory and Harwa continues to be shown \u2018in the middle\u2019, almost in a freeze-frame relief with both his Ka and brain conscious. This is highly unusual in ancient Egyptian scenes.\n\nA text well-engraved on the southern wall of the passage leading to the First Pillared Hall enumerates his good deeds having recourse to the most typical phraseology of the Egyptian \u201cideal biography\u201d. It is Harwa himself who is speaking.\n\nHe tells the visitor to the tomb: \u201cI gave bread to the hungry man, clothes to the naked man\u201d.\n\nThis phrase is pivotal in the connection between Harwa and Queen Amenirdis I as, on the reverse (and base) of the famous alabaster statue of Amenirdis I, there is a well-carved series of hieroglyphs which say:\n\n\u201cI gave food to the hungry, drink to the thirsty, clothes to the naked man.\u201d\n\nThe full translation can be found here:\n\nI have not seen a connection made anywhere regarding these two series of hieroglyphs \u2013 online or offline. I believe that this connection hasn\u2019t yet been made by the scholars but the importance of the similar phrases is amazing to me.\n\nHarwa held the position of \u201cGrand Steward\u201d for about forty years from the time of Piankhy, serving under Nubian pharaohs Shabaqo or Shabaka (713-698 BCE) and Shebitqo (698-690 BCE), until the reign of Taharqo or Taharqa (690 \u2013 664 BCE).\n\n\u2018Coincidentally\u2019, Amenirdis I is said to have served as God\u2019s Wife of Amun, Divine Adoratrice (or Divine Votaress) and \u201cGod\u2019s Hand\u201d for approximately forty years.\n\n[Taharqo (or Taharqa) was the uncle of Amunirdis.]\n\nIt is my personal belief that Amenirdis I and Harwa had a close relationship and ruled \u2018together\u2019 (under various roles) from ancient Thebes at approximately the same times in ancient Egypt.\n\nDuring the 1997 archaeological campaign in Harwa\u2019s tomb (TT37), a limestone ushabty (or shabti) was unearthed showing features which shed new light on some aspects of the role played by Harwa inside the Theban administration. It is a typically mummiform funerary statuette of the XXV Dynasty but it holds in his hands the crook and the flail, that is to say, the regalia, the characteristic emblems of the pharaonic royalty.\n\nAs far as it is known, it is the only example of non-royal ushabty displaying such a characteristic.\n\nFurthermore, in the Chapter VI of the Book of the Dead engraved on the body, Harwa is mentioned as \u201cGreat of the Greats\u201d.\n\nThese evidences should point out that Harwa had more power than the one deriving from his role and that he can be considered as the co-governor of the Theban region on the behalf of the Nubian King alongside the Divine Adoratrice, Amunirdis I.\n\nAlso the vastness of his tomb and the high number of his statues can support the hypothesis that Harwa was the most politically influential person of the State; stretching to the First Cataract (a graffito signed by him has been found at Nag\u2019esh Sheikh, near Aswan).\n\nIf this assumption is confirmed by further excavations, then the positions of Montuemhat and Petamenophis will have to be reconsidered. They chose in fact to place their tombs east and west of the tomb of Harwa as if they attributed a high reverence to him and considered him a sort of ancestor. In this frame one has to ask: is it possible to speak of a \u201cdynasty\u201d of functionaries governing the Theban region with the consent of the Nubian kings? If this proves to be true, then, as they did not belong to the one family nor did they share the same titles and position, what was the mechanism of succession of these functionaries? No-one yet knows the answer to that question or the countless others raised by the life, works and tomb of Harwa, Grand Steward in the Precinct of Amun.\n\nMany questions are raised merely because of the surviving evidence belonging to Amenirdis I and Harwa but there are some issues which are quite clear:\n\nUpper Egypt was ruled well under the governance of these two mighty figures (and others) and for forty years, approximately, Upper Egypt was relatively peaceful (as opposed to the XXIII to XXIV Dynasties political and religious unrest and turmoil) whilst Pharaoh Shabaka (Amunirdis I\u2019s brother) ruled from Memphis. Even after the death of her brother, Amunirdis I remained in control and acted, along with others, as the First Prophet of Amun, answering the State\u2019s needs on many levels. Order was temporarily restored and both Amunirdis I and Harwa played a major role in ancient Egypt at that time.\n\nIf you would like to read more about Harwa, please see these web sites:"
