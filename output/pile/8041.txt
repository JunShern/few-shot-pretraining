    "text": "Archive | September, 2012\n\nI love old sports cars. Performance cars are very different, model to model \u2013 some have flat-out speed, some corner like slot cars, some have lively steering, etc. Few cars have \u201ceverything desired\u201d \u2013 each model has strengths and compromises.\n\nAutocross racing intrigues me \u2013 it\u2019s track racing made accessible to enthusiasts like me. Early on, a peer coach helped me understand how to get the best performance and most satisfying experiences while racing.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt\u2019s not about pure speed. It\u2019s about feeling the car \u2018in the moment,\u2019 every moment.\u201d The best drivers are very attuned to the subtle weight shifts that signal where and how a car is poised on the track. Driving straight is easy. When you\u2019re passing cars or turning to find the most efficient line through a corner, the car\u2019s subtle weight shifts give you clues about how it\u2019s handling.\n\nFeeling the nuances of weight transfer, and leveraging that weight transfer for efficiency and speed, is much more art than science.\n\nProactive Culture Management Requires \u201cFeel\u201d\n\nManaging your team or organization\u2019s culture is also more art than science. Vital culture elements \u2013 clear performance expectations, clear values standards, and accountability for both \u2013 don\u2019t make a team\u2019s culture perfect. Just like a track car\u2019s weight shifts in the race, your team\u2019s culture shifts, moment to moment. To ensure your culture is serving your organization, customers, and employees equally well, you must learn to \u201cfeel\u201d the subtle shifts that provide clues about how your culture is operating. Where you see clues of aligned behavior, celebrate and praise. Where you see clues of \u201cless aligned\u201d behavior, redirect the culture back \u201con track.\u201d\n\nHere are the top three \u201cculture shifts\u201d I coach leaders to pay attention to:\n\nValues Demonstration \u2013 Are valued behaviors modeled daily, no matter the temptations to short cut a process or gain an unfair advantage? Stay attuned to values by observing leaders working with team members and team members interacting with each other and with customers. Promptly praise raise aligned behavior and redirect mis-aligned behavior.\n\nPromises Kept \u2013 Are commitments made by the team and by team members diligently honored? Any promise not kept is an unhealthy action that can lead to further eroding of your team\u2019s integrity, as well as the integrity of individual team members. Every day, observe and inquire about team members doing what they say they will do.\n\nCelebrate Progress & Accomplishment \u2013 Do team members praise and encourage each other, day to day, or are they more interested in catching others doing things wrong than in doing things right? A validating culture looks for and celebrates things done well and going well.\n\nPlease join in THIS conversation! What are the culture shifts YOU pay attention to?

It\u2019s not complicated.\n\nThink about your own best boss \u2013 the person you worked for who created an environment where you were immensely productive and you loved going to work every day. What did your best boss do to create that environment for you and your team members?\n\nI\u2019ve asked this question of clients for over 20 years. The answers are remarkably consistent across a wide range of industries, organization size, country of origin, even personality. From my research, these are the most consistently reported \u201cbest boss\u201d behaviors:\n\nThey care. Each team member is a valued person.\n\nThey celebrate. They give praise, encouragement, and credit.\n\nThey listen.\n\nThey validate others\u2019 ideas, efforts, and accomplishment.\n\nThey\u2019re available.\n\nThey inspire increasing performance in service to customers.\n\nNotice the pattern of these great boss behaviors. They are primarily about support, validation, and connection \u2013 not about, for example, pay, goals, or metrics. Certainly great bosses must inspire terrific consistent performance. And, for these \u201cbest bosses,\u201d they spend more time creating and maintaining positive personal relationships than they do driving results.\n\nThe payoff for leaders that connect through conversations with employees? Better results.\n\nKnowing these consistent great boss behaviors is one thing \u2013 demonstrating them every day with team members is another! The simplest, most effective avenue for leaders to connect to employees is through regular conversations.\n\nTwo colleagues have written a terrific book that helps leaders have more authentic conversations with employees. Beverly Kaye and Julie Winkle Giulioni\u2019s book, \u201cHelp Them Grow or Watch Them Go,\u201d is available today. Beverly and Julie present a vibrant model that outlines the importance of proactive, frequent discussions about progress, opportunities, and career.\n\nTheir model describes conversations that engage leaders and employees in hindsight (learning from past effort and identifying what employees are good at AND love doing), foresight (considering the changing business environment and what those changes mean for the future), and finding insight, the \u201csweet spot\u201d where hindsight overlaps foresight, illuminating paths to enhance employee skills, contribution, and career.\n\nBeing a great boss is not complicated. It simply requires proactive engagement on the leader\u2019s part to invest time, attention, and conversation with each team member. Where those conversations enable the employee to feel cared for, listened to, validated, and inspired, the leader is on the path to being that team member\u2019s best boss.\n\nPlease join in THIS conversation!

I struggled to breathe. Shooting pains ran down my arms. Instead of thinking, \u201cThese are the classic symptoms of a heart attack,\u201d I told myself, \u201cHuh. I may not go into work today.\u201d\n\nIt was December 17, 1993 and my life changed that day. I became a heart attack survivor and a heart patient for the rest of my life.\n\nIn the weeks before my myocardial infarction, I experienced symptoms that were consistent with clogged arteries. I ignored them. I had work to do. I had a job I loved \u2013 actually two jobs: internal consultant with the Federal Reserve Bank and director of the YMCA Pacific Region High School Conference, held each Thanksgiving weekend.\n\nI was driven to succeed in those two jobs. That drive caused me to make lousy choices. I didn\u2019t exercise. I didn\u2019t eat healthy. I compromised my relationship with my family \u2013 all because of my focus on my work and my desire to be successful.\n\nA heart attack gets your attention! It let me know that my current path wasn\u2019t a good one.\n\nMost importantly, I learned that unless I was my healthy, best self, I was of no earthly good to anybody. Not my clients, not my family \u2013 nobody.\n\nOhio State football coach Urban Meyer had a similar experience. His drive to succeed as the Florida Gators football coach caused him to experience a frightening health scare that caused him to leave that coveted job. After a year off, Ohio State pursued him for their head coach role. Meyer sought his family\u2019s blessing to take the job. They gave their permission only after Urban signed an agreement that includes:\n\nMy family comes first.\n\nI maintain good health.\n\nI go no more than nine hours per day at the office.\n\nI communicate daily with my kids.\n\nI sleep with my cellphone on \u201cmute.\u201d\n\nI trust God\u2019s plan and am not overanxious.\n\nI eat three meals a day.\n\nMeyer says that meeting these requirements is a \u201cwork in progress.\u201d He\u2019s trying hard to be present and intentional with his health and his family relationships \u2013 so he can serve them and his football responsibilities equally well.\n\nWhat gets in the way of YOUR best self today? How might you reduce the time you spend, boost your efficiency, or lower the anxiety you feel at or about work? How can you be more present for family, community, and friends so you can be of service and of grace, not discontent and anxious about work and life?\n\nMy health is good these days. I\u2019ve lost another 20 pounds over the past two years on the slow carb diet. And, I am a work in progress!\n\nJoin in the conversation! What gets in the way of you being your best self?

I was invited to join the Jones and Raine band in 2007; it is the most talented, musical, and enjoyable band I\u2019ve ever experienced. The reason why may surprise you. It\u2019s not about musicianship or cool gear or great songs or even teamwork \u2013 though all those things certainly help. It\u2019s about listening.\n\nLive music is an interesting challenge. Great live performances are not created by individuals playing their parts at full volume! That creates noise and static which is not pleasurable to listen to.\n\nGreat live performances require well-prepared, skilled players who work WITH each other, listening carefully to leave space for others\u2019 contributions, and not step on anyone\u2019s toes with an unfortunately timed vocal or instrumental. Every note played, every word sung, needs to serve the song\u2019s message and the listener\u2019s receipt of it. Every tune played needs an intentional strategy to guide the players and the performance.\n\nRecording in the studio is a different deal. In that sterile setting, individual players can lay down perfect tracks. The producer and engineer(s) mix and master those tracks to position parts (instruments, vocals, lead instrumentation, etc.) in the stereo soundstage, to ensure clarity of tracks, and to present the song in it\u2019s best, final form. For performers, studio work is less complex than live shows \u2013 you come in, play your parts, and then leave the mixing and mastering (HOURS of hard work) to the pros.\n\nIn a live setting, it is all too easy to create a \u201cwall of sound\u201d that doesn\u2019t distinguish vocals, keyboards, or guitar performances \u2013 or the song\u2019s meaning. The best bands \u2013 like the best work teams \u2013 listen carefully, in the moment, to work together to present the best possible combination of skills and performance for the receiver(s).\n\nDoes Your Team Create Music or Noise?\n\nIn organizations, it is all too rare that a team cooperates, listens, and leverages team members\u2019 best selves in service to internal and external customers. Most teams create noise \u2013 where individual performers do their thing without clear regard for the total package.\n\nThat noise may not be intentional. It could be that individual performers see themselves in a \u201csterile setting\u201d much like that of a recording studio. They perform and leave the \u201cmixing and mastering\u201d to someone else.\n\nIn most cases and with most teams, there isn\u2019t someone else to pull it all together. If you want your team\u2019s live performance to be pleasurable to your \u201clisteners\u201d (customers), every team member needs to bring their best performance, listen for the right space to contribute, and offer space for team mates to contribute, too.\n\nPlease join in the conversation! What are your experiences with work teams \u2013 has it been music or noise or something in between?
