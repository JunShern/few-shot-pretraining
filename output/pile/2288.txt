    "text": "ANNOUNCEMENT {#s1}\n============\n\nThe ascomycete fungus Fusarium graminearum is the main pathogen causing *Fusarium* head blight (FHB), an important cereal disease worldwide ([@B1]). The F. graminearum genome from a South American strain was not previously available. Here, we report an annotated assembly for strain CML3066 (DON/15-ADON), isolated in 2009 in Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil (latitude, \u221228.327, longitude, \u221251.271). This strain was isolated from a symptomatic wheat spike with 21.5% FHB incidence ([@B2]).\n\nGenomic DNA of F. graminearum CML3066 was extracted from mycelia grown for 3 days in potato dextrose broth (PDB) medium using a cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) protocol ([@B3]) and quantified using a Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (Life Technologies). Libraries were prepared with TruSeq DNA high-throughput (HT) (Illumina) and SMRTbell (PacBio) kits. Genome sequencing was done both on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform, producing 100-bp paired-end reads (91\u00d7 coverage) with no quality control required, and on a PacBio RS II platform with a postquality filter of minimum polymerase read quality of 0.80 and minimum subread length of 500 bp, resulting in 160\u00d7 coverage with a subread total of 6,392,721,477 bp, 1,358,615 reads, and an *N*~50~ value of 5,621 bp. Default parameters were used for all software unless otherwise noted. The *de novo* assembly was carried out using SOAPdenovo2 v2.0.4 using the Illumina data with a range of k-mer values (61 to 99) and the SMRT analysis portal using the PacBio data. The PacBio assembly was manually gap filled and further scaffolded using Lastz v1.04.03 alignments with the complementary Illumina assembly, resulting in four complete chromosomes from telomere to telomere with no gaps or N bases. Reference sequence statistics were extracted from Geneious v8.1. The genome annotation of CML3066 was done using the MAKER v2.30 ([@B4]) annotation pipeline with RepeatMasker v4.50 ([@B5]). Gene calls were generated using both AUGUSTUS v2.7 ([@B6]) using the F. graminearum species model and GeneMark ([@B7]), which was trained using strain PH-1 ([@B8], [@B9]).\n\nThe CML3066 assembly is 36,908,675 bp long with a GC content of 47.9%. The CML3066 genome is predicted to contain 14,188 genes, 286 of which are not present in the PH-1 genome. Using the PH-1 reference, a minimum of 80% of the length of the gene was required to have mapped reads to be considered present. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling was performed with SAMtools using default settings. SNP effects were predicted using SnpEff 4.2. Comparison of SNP frequencies along all four chromosomes of both CML3066 and PH-1 ([@B8], [@B10]) revealed that all telomere proximal regions displayed the highest SNP density windows. In addition, chromosomes 1, 2, and 4 were found to have one or two large interstitial regions with a high SNP density. To predict secreted proteins, Blast2GO v3.2 was used to identify signal peptide and transmembrane domains. Prediction of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored membrane proteins, cellular protein localization, and effectors was performed using Big-Pi, WoLF PSort and ProtComp v9.0 (Softberry), and EffectorP v1.0 ([@B11][@B12][@B14]), respectively. The secretome was predicted to contain 874 genes. A genome comparison between CML3066 and the reference strain PH-1 is summarized in [Table\u00a01](#tab1){ref-type=\"table\"}.\n\n###### \n\nGenome sequence assemblies for F. graminearum strains PH-1 and CML3066\n\n  Characteristic                                            Value for strain:   \n  --------------------------------------------------------- ------------------- ------------\n  Genome size (bp)[^*b*^](#ngtab1.2){ref-type=\"table-fn\"}   36,663,736          36,908,675\n  No. of chromosomes                                        4                   4\n  GC content (%)[^*c*^](#ngtab1.3){ref-type=\"table-fn\"}     48.2                47.9\n  No. of spanned gaps                                       0                   0\n  No. of predicted genes                                    14,145              14,188\n\n![](MRA.00157-20-t0001)\n\nReannotated genome ([@B10]).\n\nIncluding all scaffolds and the mitochondrial genome but excluding the large repetitive sequence at the carboxyl end of chromosome 4.\n\nExcluding the mitochondrial genome.\n\nData availability. {#s1.1}\n------------------\n\nThe raw data and assembled/annotated sequences have been deposited in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA).
