    "text": "ART GOLACKI\n\nArt Golacki is a multidisciplinary artist working with traditional mediums as well as installations, photography and digital processing. He was born in Wroclaw, Poland where he also accomplished a Master Degree in Fine Arts. For the past twenty years, Golacki has lived and worked in the United Kingdom, currently in Millport, Scotland.\n\nIn each of Golacki\u2019senigmatic still-life images, a number of man-made, as well as organic objects, are covered inmonochromatic paint and arranged to mimic the classical memento mori. This process renders many objects unidentifiable and thus visually equal; creating a primal, intuitive scene devoid of arbitrary learned judgments or categorical labels. Golacki aspires to evoke a kind of reflective state of mind in the viewer while at the same time, creating an homage to the artistry of Old and also Contemporary Masters."
