For the Hack can scatter into flight\nShakespere and Dante in a single Night!\n  The Penny-a-liner is Abroad, and strikes\nOur Modern Literature with blithering Blight.\n\n\nII\n\nBefore Historical Romances died,\nMethought a Voice from Art's Olympus cried,\n \"When all Dumas and Scott is still for Sale,\nWhy nod o'er drowsy Tales, by Tyros tried?\"\n\n\nIII\n\nA cock-sure Crew with Names ne'er heard before\nGreedily shouted--\"Open then the Door!\n  You know how little Stuff is going to live,\nBut where it came from there is plenty More.\"\n\n\nIV\n\nNow the New Year reviving old Desires,\nThe Artist poor to Calendars aspires,\n  But of the Stuff the Publisher puts out\nMost in the Paper Basket soon suspires.\n\n\nV\n\nHarum indeed is gone, and Lady Rose,\nAnd Janice Meredith, where no one knows;\n  But still the Author gushes overtime,\nAnd many a Poet babbles on in Prose.\n\n\nVI\n\nAldrich's lips are lock'd; but people buy\nHigh-piping Authoresses, boomed sky-high.\n  \"How Fine!\"--the Publisher cries to the Mob,\nThat monumental Cheek to justify.\n\n\nVII\n\nCome, fill the Purse, to Publishers, this Spring,\nYour Manuscripts of paltry Passion bring:\n  The New York Times has oft a little Way\nOf praising--let The Times your praises sing.\n\n\nVIII\n\nWhether by Century or Doubleday,\nWhether Macmillan or the Harpers pay,\n  The Publisher prints new books every Year;\nThe Critics will keep Busy, anyway!\n\n\nIX\n\nEach Morn a thousand Volumes brings, you say;\nYes, but who reads the Books of Yesterday?\n  And this first Autumn List that brings the New\nShall take The Pit and Mrs. Wiggs away.\n\n\nX\n\nWell, let it take them! What, are we not through\nWith Richard Calmady and Emmy Lou?\n  Let Ade and Dooley guy us as they will,\nOr Ella Wheeler Wilcox--heed not you.\n\n\nXI\n\nWith me despise this kind of Fiction rude\nThat just divides the Rotten from the Good,\n  Where names of Poe and Dickens are forgot--\nAnd Peace to Thackeray with his giant Brood!\n\n\nXII\n\nA Book of Limericks--Nonsense, anyhow--\nAlice in Wonderland, the Purple Cow\n  Beside me singing on Fifth Avenue--\nAh, this were Modern Literature enow!\n\n\nXIII\n\nSome for the stories of The World; and some\nSigh for the Boston Transcript till it come;\n  Ah, take The Sun, and let The Herald go,\nNor heed the Yellow Journalistic scum!\n\n\nXIV\n\nLook to the blowing Advertiser--\"Lo,\nBooming's the way,\" he says, \"to make Books go!\n  I advertise until I've drained my Purse,\nAnd huge Editions on the Market throw.\"\n\n\nXV\n\nAnd those who made a Mint off Miss MacLane,\nAnd those who shuddered at her Jests profane,\n  Alike consigned her to Oblivion,\nAnd buried once, would not dig up again.\n\n\nXVI\n\nAnthony Hope men set their hearts upon--\nLike Conan Doyle he prospered; and anon,\n  Remained unopened on the dusty Shelf,\nDelighting us an Hour--and then was gone.\n\n\nXVII\n\nThink, in this gaudy monthly Magazine\nWhose Covers are Soapette and Breakfastine,\n  How Author after Author with his Tale\nFills his fool Pages, and no more is seen.\n\n\nXVIII\n\nThey say that now Miss Myra Kelly reaps\nRewards that Howells used to have for Keeps:\n  And Seton, that great Hunter of Wild Beasts\nHas Coin ahead; Cash comes to him in Heaps!\n\n\nXIX\n\nI sometimes think that never Prose is read\nSo good as that by Advertising bred,\n  And every Verse Sapolian poets sing\nBrings laurel wreaths once twin'd for Spenser's head.\n\n\nXX\n\nAnd this audacious Author, young and green\nIn Smart Set--surely you know whom I mean--\n  Ah, look upon him lightly! for who knows\nBut once in Lippincott's he wrote unseen!\n\n\nXXI\n\nAh, my Beloved, write the Book that clears\nTO-DAY of dreary Debt and sad Arrears;\n  _To-morrow!_--Why, To-morrow I may see\nMy Nonsense popular as Edward Lear's.\n\n\nXXII\n\nFor some we've read, the month's Six Selling Best\nThe Bookman scored with elephantine Jest,\n  Have sold a half a Million in a Year,\nYet no one ever heard of them, out West!\n\n\nXXIII\n\nAnd we, that now within the Editor's Room\nMake merry while we have our little Boom,\n  Ourselves must we give way to next month's Set--\nGirls with Three Names, who know not Who from Whom!\n\n\nXXIV\n\nAh, make the most of what we yet may do,\nBefore our Royalties have vanish'd, too,\n  Book after Book, and under Book to lie,\nSans Page, sans Cover, Reader--or Review!\n\n\nXXV\n\nAlike for those who for TO-DAY have Shame,\nAnd those who strive for some TO-MORROW'S Fame,\n  A Critic from anonymous Darkness cries,\n\"Fools, your Reward will fool you, just the Same!\"\n\n\nXXVI\n\nWhy, e'en Marie Corelli, who discuss'd\nOf the Two Worlds so learnedly, is thrust\n  Like Elbert Hubbard forth; her Words to Scorn\nAre scatter'd, and her Books by Critics cussed.\n\n\nXXVII\n\nMyself when young did eagerly peruse\nJames, Meredith and Hardy--but to lose\n  My Reason, trying to make Head or Tail;\nThe more I read, the more did they confuse.\n\n\nXXVIII\n\nWith them the Germs of Madness did I sow,\nAnd with \"Two Magics\" sought to make it grow;\n  Yet this was all the Answer that I found--\n\"What it is all about, I do not know!\"\n\n\nXXIX\n\nInto the Library, and _Why_ not knowing,\nNor _What I Want_, I find myself a-going;\n  And out of it, with Nothing fit to Read--\nSuch is the Catalogue's anaemic Showing.\n\n\nXXX\n\nWhat, without asking, to be hypnotized\nInto a Sale of Stevenson disguised?\n  Oh, many a page of Bernard Shaw's last Play\nMust drown the thought of Novels Dramatized!\n\n\nXXXI\n\nUp from the Country, into gay Broadway\nI came, and bought a Scribner's, yesterday,\n  And many a Tale I read and understood,\nBut not the master-tale of Kipling's \"They.\"\n\n\nXXXII\n\nThere was a Plot to which I found no Key;\nAnd Others seem to be as Dull as Me;\n  Some little talk there was of Ghosts, and Such,\nThen Mrs. Bathurst left me more at Sea!\n\n\nXXXIII\n\nKim could not answer--Sherlock Holmes would fail--\nThe most enlightened Browningite turn pale\n  In futile Wonder and in blank Dismay;\nSay, is there ANY Meaning to that Tale?\n\n\nXXXIV\n\nThen of the Critic, he who works behind\nThe Author's back, I tried the Clue to find;\n  But he, too, was in Darkness; and I heard\nA Literary Agent say--\"THEY ALL ARE BLIND!\"\n\n\nXXXV\n\nThen, from the lips of Editor, I learn,\n\"This Story is the Kind for which I Yearn;\n  Its Advertising brought us such Renown,\nWe jumped Three Hundred Thousand, on that Turn!\"\n\n\nXXXVI\n\nI think the man exaggerated some\nHis increased Circulation,--but, I vum!\n  If I could get Two Thousand for one Tale,\nI'd write him Something that would simply Hum!\n\n\nXXXVII\n\nFor I remember, shopping by the way,\nI saw a Novel writ by Bertha Clay;\n  And there was scrawled across its Title-Page,\n\"This is the Stuff that Sells--so People say!\"\n\n\nXXXVIII\n\nListen--a moment listen!--Of the same\nWood-pulp on which is printed Hewlett's Name,\n  The \"Duchess\" Books are made--in fifty years\nThey both will rot asunder--who's to Blame?\"\n\n\nXXXIX\n\nAnd not a Book that from our Shelves we throw\nTo the Salvation Army, but shall go\n  To vitiate the Taste of some poor Soul\nWho can get nothing else to read--go Slow!\n\n\nXL\n\nAs then the Poet for his morning Sup\nFills with a Metaphor his mental Cup,\n  Do you devoutly read your Manuscripts\nThat Someone may, before you burn them up!\n\n\nXLI\n\nPerplex'd no more with editorial \"Nay\"\nTo-morrow's Reputation cast away,\n  And lose your College Education in\nThe flippant, foolish Fiction of To-day.\n\n\nXLII\n\nAnd if the Bosh you write, the Trash you read,\nEnd in the Garbage Barrel--take no Heed;\n  Think that you are no worse than other Scribes,\nWho scribble Stuff to meet the Public Need.\n\n\nXLIII\n\nSo, when WHO'S-WHO records your silly Name,\nYou'll think that you have found the Road to Fame;\n  And though ten thousand other Names are there,\nYou'll fancy you're a Genius, just the Same!\n\n\nXLIV\n\nWhy, if an Author can fling Art aside,\nAnd in a Book of Balderdash take Pride,\n  Wer't not a Shame--wer't not a Shame for him\nA Conscientious Novel to have tried?\n\n\nXLV\n\nWriting's a Trade where Newspapers pay best;\nLeGallienne this Verity confess'd;\n  So join the Union, like the rest of us--\nWho strikes for Art is looked at as a Jest.\n\n\nXLVI\n\nAnd fear not, if the Editor refuse\nYour work, he has no more from which to choose;\n  The Literary Microbe shall bring forth\nMillions of Manuscripts too bad to use.\n\n\nXLVII\n\nWhen Fitch's Comedies have all gone past,\nOh, the long Time Pinero's plays shall last,\n  Which of Belasco's little Triumphs heed\nAs Frohman's Self should heed a Bowery Cast!\n\n\nXLVIII\n\nA Moment's Halt--Pray see this charming, chaste\nLadies' Home Journal--\"On the New Shirt Waist\"--\n  \"Advice to Girls,\" and so forth--here is reach'd\nThe Nothing women yearn for, undebased!\n\n\nXLIX\n\nWould you a hurried Lunch Hour wish to spend\nAbout THE SECRET--hearken to me, Friend!\n  The Editors themselves must guess their Way--\nAnd on their Wives' and Sisters' Hints depend!\n\n\nL\n\nA Hair perhaps divides the Good from Bad;\nAnd Bok himself a Lot of Trouble had\n  Before he found Stenographers were Wise--\nThen, as they laughed or wept, his Soul was glad.\n\n\nLI\n\nThe Woman's Touch runs through our Magazines;\nFor her the Home-and-Mother Tale, and Scenes\n  Of Love-and-Action, Happy at the End--\nThe same old Plots, the same old Ways and Means.\n\n\nLII\n\nThe Theme once guess'd, the Tale's as good as told,\nThough Dialect and Local Color mould;\n  This Style will last throughout Eternity,\nWhile Women buy our Books--if Books are sold.\n\n\nLIII\n\nBut if, in spite of this, you build a Plot\nWhich these immortal Elements has not,\n  You gaze TO-DAY upon a Slip, which reads:\n\"The Editor Regrets\"--and such-like Rot.\n\n\nLIV\n\nWaste not your Ink, and don't attempt to use\nThat Subtle Touch which Editors refuse;\n  Better be jocund at two cents a word\nThan, starving, court an ill-requited Muse!\n\n\nLV\n\nYou know, my Friends, I've done with Purple Cows,\nAnd long to sober Fiction paid my Vows;\n  Spontaneous Glee is mighty hard to Sell--\n'Twas Carolyn Wells that shot across _my_ Bows.\n\n\nLVI\n\nFor Stuff and Nonsense being in my Line,\nAs Nonsense modern Fiction I define;\n  But of the sort that one would care for, I\nCan find but Little--and that Little's mine!\n\n\nLVII\n\nAh, but this wholesale Satire, you may say,\nMakes me pretend to be a Critic--Nay!\n  Rather be roasted than to roast, say I;\nAnd I have been well roasted, by the way!\n\n\nLVIII\n\nAnd lately, in a Studio, a Miss\nSat smiling o'er a Book--and it was this:\n  \"The Pipes of Pan\"--she showed it me, and read,\nBidding me pay attention--it was Bliss!\n\n\nLIX\n\nBliss Carman, who with genius absolute,\nMy poor satiric Logic can confute;\n  The only Poet who, in modern Days,\nHis Poems can to clinking Gold transmute!\n\n\nLX\n\nThe vagrant Singer, how does he, good Lord,\nCompete with such a money-making Horde\n  Of tinsel rhymesters that infest the Shops?\nThey say he makes enough to pay his Board!\n\n\nLXI\n\nWhy, be our Talent truly Art, how dare\nRefuse our Lucubrations everywhere?\n  And if it's Rot, as our Rejections hint,\nGod knows the things they print are Rot, for Fair!\n\n\nLXII\n\nI must abjure Dramatic Force, I must\nTake the Sub-Editor's decree on Trust,\n  Or, lured by hope of selling something Good,\nWrite out my Heart--then burn it in Disgust!\n\n\nLXIII\n\nOh, threats of Failure, hopes of Royalties!\nOne thing at least I've sold--these Parodies;\n  One thing is certain, Satire always sells;\nThe Roast is read, no matter where it is.\n\n\nLXIV\n\nStrange, is it not? that of the Authors who\nPublish in England, such a mighty Few\n  Make a Success, though here they score a Hit?\nThe British Public knows a Thing or Two!\n\n\nLXV\n\nBy Revelations of the Past we've learn'd\nThe Yankee Author usually is burn'd;\n  All of our Story Writers say the Same;\nThe London Critic all their Books have spurn'd.\n\n\nLXVI\n\nI sent my Agent where the Buyers dwell,\nSome clever Stories of my own to sell:\n  And by and by the Agent said to me,\n\"One thing I sold--that's doing Mighty Well!\"\n\n\nLXVII\n\nSo Heaven seems tame indeed when I behold\nEditions of Five Hundred Thousand sold;\n  When Clippings show how Critics scorch me, then\nHell's Roasting seems comparatively Cold!\n\n\nLXVIII\n\nWe are no other than a passing Show\nOf clumsy Mountebanks that come and go\n  To please the General Public; now, who gave\nTo IT the right to judge, I'd like to know?\n\n\nLXIX\n\nImpotent Writers bound to feed ITS taste\nFor Literature and Poetry debased;\n  Hither and thither pandering we strive,\nAnd one by one our Talents are disgraced.\n\n\nLXX\n\nThe Scribe no question makes of Verse or Prose,\nBut what the Editor demands he shows;\n  And he who buys three thousand words of Drule,\n_He_ knows what People want--you Bet He knows!\n\n\nLXXI\n\nThe facile Scribbler writes; and, having writ,\nNo Rules of Rhetoric bother him a Bit,\n  Or lure him back to cancel half a Line,\nNor Grammar's protests change a Word of it.\n\n\nLXXII\n\nAnd though you wring your Hands and wonder Why\nSuch slipshod Work the Magazines will buy,\n  Don't grumble at the Editor, for he\nMust serve the Public, e'en as You and I.\n\n\nLXXIII\n\nWith Puck's first joke, they did the last Life feed,\nAnd there of Judge's Stories sowed the Seed:\n  And the first jokelet that Joe Miller wrote\nThe Sunday Comic-Section readers read.\n\n\nLXXIV\n\nYESTERDAY _This_ Day's popular Song supplants;\nTO-MORROW'S will be even worse, perchance:\n  Drink! For the latest <DW53>-Song's floating by:\nDrink! Now the music is an Indian Dance!\n\n\nLXXV\n\nI tell you this--When, started from the Goal,\nThe first Plantation Ditty 'gan to roll\n  Through Minstrel Troupes and <DW64> Baritones\nIn its predestined race from Pole to Pole,\n\n\nLXXVI\n\nThe Song had caught a Rag-Time girls could shout\nAnd Piano-Organs make a Din about;\n  But syncopated Melodies at last\nWill pass away, and more shall come, no doubt.\n\n\nLXXVII\n\nAnd this I know: though Vaudeville delight,\nMusical Comedy can bore me quite;\n  One act of Ibsen from the Gallery caught,\nBetter than Daly for a festal Night!\n\n\nLXXVIII\n\nWhat! out of senseless Show-Girls to evoke\nA Drama? Surely, I resent the Joke!\n  For me, it is not Pleasure, but a Pain--\nAn Everlasting Bore for decent Folk.\n\n\nLXXIX\n\nWhat, must the Theatre Manager be paid--\nOur Gold for what his Carpenter has made--\n  Must we pay Stars we never did Contract,\nAnd cannot hiss at?--Oh, the sorry trade!\n\n\nLXXX\n\nOh Thou, who dost with cool sarcastic Grin\nScorn the poor Magazine my Story's in,\n  Though Thou impute to ignorance my Work,\nI know how bad 't will be, ere I begin!\n\n\nLXXXI\n\nOh Thou, whose Taste demandeth silly Tales,\nDamning the Author when he Tries and Fails,\n  Let us toss up to see which one is Worse--\nThy Fault or mine--Which is it, Heads or Tails?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\nLXXXII\n\nAs, for his Luncheon Hour, away had slipp'd\nThe Editor, his Office-Boy I tipp'd,\n  And once again before the Sacred Desk\nI stood, surrounded by much Manuscript.\n\n\nLXXXIII\n\nManuscripts of all Sizes, great and small,\nUpon that Desk, in Numbers to appall!\n  And Some looked very interesting; some\nI saw no Sign of Merit in, at all.\n\n\nLXXXIV\n\nSaid one among them--\"Surely not in vain\nMy Author has exhausted all his Brain\n  In writing me, to be rejected here--\nI'd hate to have to be sent back again!\"\n\n\nLXXXV\n\nThen said a Second--\"Ne'er a Girl or Boy\nSuch Stuff as I am really could enjoy:\n  Yet He who wrote me, when I am return'd,\nWill me with Curse and bitter Wrath destroy!\"\n\n\nLXXXVI\n\nAfter a literary Silence spake\nA Manuscript of Henry James's make;\n  \"They sneer at me for being so occult:\nBut Kipling's found such Stuff is going to Take!\"\n\n\nLXXXVII\n\nWhereat some one of the typewritten Lot--\nI think it was Cy Brady's--waxing hot--\n  \"All this of Shop and Patter--Tell me then,\nWho buys--Who reads--the Stuff that boils _my_ Pot?\"\n\n\nLXXXVIII\n\n\"Why,\" said another, \"Some there are who tell\nOf one who threatens he will toss to Hell\n  The luckless Tales he marr'd in making--Pish!\nHe's a blamed Fool, Any Old Thing will sell!\"\n\n\nLXXXIX\n\n\"Well,\" murmur'd one, \"Let whoso write or buy,\nMy words with long Oblivion are gone dry:\n  But bind me new, let Christy illustrate,\nMethinks I'd sell at Christmas time; I'll try!\"\n\n\nXC\n\nSo while the Manuscripts were wisely speaking,\nThe Editor came in whom I was seeking:\n  And then they signall'd to me, \"Brother! Brother!\nYours is rejected! You had best be sneaking!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\nXCI\n\nThough Carnegie for Literature provide,\nHe tombs a Body whence the Life has died,\n  And no one seems to turn a single leaf\nUpon the unfrequented Classic side,\n\n\nXCII\n\nUnless to see some First Edition rare,\nOr curious styles of Binding to compare;\n  Art's True Believers know their Aldus well,\nBut of the Author bound, are unaware!\n\n\nXCIII\n\nIndeed, Rare Books that they have yearn'd for long\nHave done their Literary Taste much wrong:\n  Reprints of Burton will not sell to-day\n(I mean the stupid Burton) for a Song!\n\n\nXCIV\n\nIndeed, such First Editions oft before\nI envied, but they proved to be a Bore.\n  Why, are not Tenth Editions still more rare?\nMine are! Why are they not worth even more?\n\n\nXCV\n\nAnd much as Art has play'd the Infidel\nAnd robb'd me of my Royalties--Ah, well,\n  I often wonder what the Women read\nOne half as clever as the Stuff I sell!\n\n\nXCVI\n\nYet Ah, that Spring should come to bring our Woes!\nThat Christmas Season's Sales should ever close!\n  The Book whose praises loud the Critic sang,\nIs not the one that sells the most, God knows!\n\n\nXCVII\n\nWould but these Book Reviewers ever yield\nOne glimpse--if dimly, yet indeed, reveal'd\n  Of what the fainting Traveller can read\nWorth reading--but the Critic's eyes are seal'd.\n\n\nXCVIII\n\nWould but some winged Angel bring the News\nOf Critic who _reads_ Books that he Reviews!\n  And make the stern Reviewer do as well\nHimself, before he Meed of Praise refuse!\n\n\nXCIX\n\nAh, Love! could you and I perchance succeed\nIn boiling down the Million Books we read\n  Into One Book, and edit that a Bit--\nThere'd be a WORLD'S BEST LITERATURE, indeed!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\nC\n\nOh, rising Author, read Me once again\nBefore my Memory gradually wane!\n  How oft hereafter you may look for me\nIn this same Library--and look in vain!\n\n\nCI\n\nAnd when, dear Reader, _you_ shall chance to spend\nA night within The Hall of Fame--attend!\n  If, in that blissful call, you find the Spot\nWhere I broke in--don't turn me down, my friend!\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Rubaiyat of Omar Cayenne, by Gelett Burgess\n\n*** "
