    "text": "Fellowship is so much more than events. I sometimes describe biblical fellowship as \u201ca common lifestyle shared by people with common values, making similar sacrifices, and experiencing common communal experiences.\u201d\n\nPeople who live a life of biblical fellowship are authentic and vulnerable with one another, meet one another\u2019s needs, and do life together \u2014 truly. Bible study groups who enjoy biblical fellowship can honestly say that they have shared laughter and tears.\n\nThis kind of fellowship seldom happens if the only time a group gets together is for group meetings. Gatherings away from the group time are essential if the group is going to experience transformational fellowship.\n\nFollowing are a list of options that may be helpful to you and your group as you brainstorm ideas of things you can do together this winter.\n\nGather around a bonfire snacks and conversation.\n\nGo on a snow skiing adventure.\n\nHost a game night to unleash everyone\u2019s competitive side.\n\nHave a viewing party for the NCAA men\u2019s basketball Final Four.\n\nEnlist group members to open their homes for a progressive dinner.\n\nGo sledding in a local park.\n\nAttend a concert together.\n\nVenture out for a night of karaoke. (This may not be for all groups.)\n\nEnjoy a movie night at someone\u2019s home or go to the theater together.\n\nGet together to watch an awards shows on television.\n\nWe would love to hear your and experiences. What are some things your group has done that aren\u2019t listed?\n\nWe\u2019ve all been there. Sitting in a living room, having just finished a Bible study, your small group now turns to a time of prayer by soliciting requests. Sally shares about her cat Freckles. Freckles is old and has a bad hip\u2014so she asks for healing for Freckles. You can\u2019t quite imagine the apostle Paul praying for his sick cat, but you don\u2019t want to be a jerk so you join the others by bowing your head and praying for Freckles.\n\nSomething doesn\u2019t seem quite right, but you\u2019re not sure why. This repeats itself throughout the meeting and from week to week. A single man shares about being really busy at work and requests prayer for energy. A couple shares about their upcoming trip to Colorado and asks for traveling mercies. Someone else shares about his second cousin just diagnosed with breast cancer. Your group dutifully bows their heads in earnest prayer. A newly married couple in the group shares a praise: marriage has been better than they could have ever imagined. Smiles and prayers of thanksgiving go up to God.\n\nYou wonder, Is this what small group prayer is all about? The prayer requests are near and dear to each person who shares, yet they seem to lack depth. They\u2019re not shallow, but they\u2019re also not substantive and seem to miss the bigness of God. They hover on the surface when your group is longing to go deeper with one another and with God. What should you do?\n\nNavigating the Tension\n\nThere is a tension in prayer. We don\u2019t want to be cynical, hard-hearted, nit-picking prayer police who point out the shallowness of other peoples\u2019 requests. And we know that God desires for his people to pray with freedom to ask God for anything. Jesus doesn\u2019t just throw out things like \u201cask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you\u201d (John 15:7) without really meaning it. If Jesus meant you can only pray for the really important or spiritual stuff he would have said so.\n\nYet Jesus makes answers to prayer conditioned on faith (Matt. 21:22), asking in Jesus\u2019s name (John 14:14; 16:24), abiding in Christ (John 15:7), persistence (Luke 18:1-8), having right motives (Jas. 4:3) and asking according to his will (1 John 5:14). And then we get verses that tell us just to ask (Matt. 7:7-11), to pray without ceasing (1 Th. 5:17) and to bring all of our anxieties and concerns to God in prayer (Phil. 4:6). So what should we do if our small group prayer times seem unusually skewed towards asking for stuff (petition), interspersed with some prayers of thanksgiving? What do we do if many of the things we pray for skim along the surface without ever getting deeper?\n\nPraying is a learned skill that takes time, discipline, and work. Corporate prayer is shallow because private prayer is infrequent. Recognize that we all have room to grow in learning to pray to God together. Be gracious with one another. Yet learn to guide a small group\u2019s prayer time. Here are a few suggestions.\n\n1. Remind the group what they\u2019re doing.\n\nAsking, \u201cWe have about 15 minutes left, anybody have a prayer request?\u201d will inevitably solicit shallow and circumstantial requests of the \u201cdaily bread\u201d variety. The way you\u2019ve framed the time has devalued its very significance. Take the opportunity to remind the group what prayer is. Instead of saying, \u201cAny prayer requests?\u201d ask, \u201cNow as we move from studying God\u2019s Word to praising him through prayer, what are some things God\u2019s Word has revealed to us?\u201d Remind the group that prayer is communicating with the God of the universe through the access purchased for us by the costly sacrifice of the Son and enabled by the indwelling Holy Spirit. We can reflect back to God praise, adoration, thanksgiving, confession, and petition in light of his revelation. We are approaching a holy God through the mediation of his beloved Son, in whom we have union and fellowship. Help the group be awed by what they will embark upon so that the oft-neglected aspects of small group prayer\u2014praise, adoration, confession, and thanksgiving\u2014will become natural responses to what God has revealed.\n\n2. Let Scripture guide your prayers.\n\nIf your group has just concluded a spirited study of a passage of Philippians (or whatever book you\u2019re studying), keep your Bibles open and let Scripture guide your time of prayer. God\u2019s revealed Word provides the content and trajectory for our prayers. Pray the commands from the passage you just studied, asking God to help you obey. Praise God for truths revealed in the passage, thanking him for who he is and how his power, wisdom, and majesty are revealed. Let the Scriptures guide how you pray. If you group has discerned the \u201cbig idea\u201d from the passage, pray for those revealed truths to transform you, your small group, church, community, and world. If you\u2019ve glimpsed an aspect of God\u2019s character, thank God for revealing it to you and praise him for his unchanging character. Ask for God\u2019s name to be hallowed in your life, in your community, and among the foreign peoples where your church missionaries are ministering.\n\nTim Keller, in his book Prayer: Experiencing Intimacy and Awe with God, describes Martin Luther\u2019s method of meditating upon a passage by discerning the instruction of the text (what does the text demand of me?) and then turning it into thanksgiving (how does this truth lead me to praise or thank God?), confession (how does this truth lead me to confess and repent?) and petition (how does this truth prompt me to appeal to God?). Providing your group a simple grid to move from the study of God\u2019s Word to praying God\u2019s Word will broaden the content of your prayers.\n\n3. Get to the heart of the issue.\n\nMany of us do not naturally discern what we really need. But Scripture opens our eyes to see our true needs in light of God\u2019s holiness, power, grace, and love. Perhaps someone shares a prayer request about being busy at work. This requires more information to know how to pray. To pray for more hours in a day or for this person to magically become more efficient is not likely to happen. Ask a few questions to better discern how to pray for this person. Is he busy because of a demanding and overbearing boss? If so, how can he live out his role as a God-honoring employee and make wise decisions on talking with his boss or prioritizing his workload? Is his busyness merely a symptom of an unhealthy desire to succeed, please others, or make the most money possible? Does he idolize his own success and the admiration he receives from others? Does he need to grow in contentment, gratefulness, and joy?\n\nGod cares about our \u201cdaily bread\u201d requests, but he\u2019s also interested in exerting his kingdom and will in our hearts and minds. God is conforming us to his image from the inside out. So for Sally\u2019s cat Freckles, you can pray not merely for the health of the cat, but more importantly, for Sally\u2019s fear, anxiety, and loneliness that are being revealed.\n\n4. Let Scripture evaluate your prayers.\n\nScripture is the best judge of our prayers. Do we generally communicate with God in various types of prayer (adoration, confession, thanksgiving, and supplication) or do we typically just list off our requests? Do we begin by praising God for his character and asking for his name to be hallowed as the Lord\u2019s Prayer instructs? Furthermore, Scripture helps us discern why some of our prayers are actually unbiblical. Praying for a new Lexus to show up on your doorstep probably doesn\u2019t pass muster for being \u201cdaily bread.\u201d Keller writes, \u201cOne way petitionary prayer can actually do us harm is if we see it as a means to say to God, \u2018My will be done.\u2019 We are prone to indulge our appetites, telling God in no uncertain terms how he should run the universe. Such prayer neither pleases God nor helps us grow in grace.\u201d Does your small group just repeat and rephrase the request\u2014\u201cI pray for healing for Nancy\u2019s cancer\u201d\u2014or do you apply the gospel of Christ to the situation? Pray for healing from cancer, but also pray for joy and trust in Christ, confidence in her eternal destiny, patience with nurses and doctors, opportunity to encourage and witness to others, and ultimately that God would be glorified through this trial.\n\nMore could certainly be said about cultivating a safe space for confession during a small group prayer time, following up prayer requests with questions of how things have gone, or praying for each other throughout the week. Yet the reality that we can approach a holy and awesome God together should awaken in us delight, joy, and praise that is reflected back to God in our prayers. Our ability to have access to God, corporately and individually, is blood-bought by the Savior. We pray to know and love God\u2014not merely to list our requests. We pray to declare, again and again, that God is God and we are not, and to be amazed, humbled, and grateful for the blood of Jesus that makes it possible for us to approach the throne of grace.\n\nAsking great questions is as much an art as it is a skill. But developing that question-asking muscle is essential for great leadership. Asking great questions is the most effective thing a leader can do to create conversational environments where people can experience healthy relationships and spiritual growth.\n\nJesus did this better than anyone in history. In the Gospels, he\u2019s asked a ton of questions \u2014 everything from \u201cAre you the Son of God?\u201d to \u201cWhich is the greatest commandment in the law?\u201d He rarely responds with an answer. Instead, he tends to ask questions that lead people to consider the truth, think about their own experiences, and reflect. Jesus understood that asking great questions helps people to process what they\u2019re thinking and feeling and to really own the answers they discover. Providing quick, simple answers doesn\u2019t usually do that.\n\nWhen it comes to asking great questions, Jesus sets the bar high. You probably won\u2019t be as quick or insightful as he was (I\u2019m not, that\u2019s for sure). But it\u2019s still a great idea to work on your question-asking skills, and to look to Christ for inspiration. You won\u2019t change overnight, but in time you\u2019ll find that your ability to ask better questions will create a better environment for your group members to grow.\n\nHere are five simple, self-explanatory tips for asking great questions in group:\n\nAsk open-ended questions, not those that can be answered with a yes or no.\n\nAsk questions that evoke feelings, make people think, and lead to insights.\n\nAsk questions that have more than one right answer.\n\nAsk questions that encourage group members to share personal examples.\n\nAsk questions that stimulate group members to apply what they\u2019re learning.\n\nResponding to questions by asking good follow-up questions engages everyone in the group. As you guide the conversation, make sure responses connect your questions to the topic you\u2019re discussing, pave the way for you and your group members to talk about your personal struggles, and encourage self-discovery by allowing people to arrive at their own conclusions with the help of the group discussion."
