    "text": "1. Field of the Invention\nThe invention relates to exercise apparatuses. More particularly, the invention relates to an exercise apparatus designed for performing squats in a convenient, safe and effective manner.\n2. Description of the Prior Art\nThe squat is a free-weight exercise in which a barbell is placed on a user's shoulders directly behind the neck and is supported by the arms while the user first lowers his or her body by bending the legs and then raises his or her body by restraightening the legs. This exercise is probably the most effective exercise for building lower body muscles and often is used by experienced weight lifters.\nHowever, this exercise can be one of the most painful and traumatic exercises since the legs are capable of lifting a large amount of weight and yet the weight must be supported by the lifter's arms and shoulders. In addition, it is one of the most dangerous exercises since it typically is terminated by placing the barbell on a rack when the lifter's legs are fully extended. As the lifter approaches his or her limit, it becomes difficult to obtain this position. Furthermore, the weight tends to throw lifters forward and cause them to lose their balance. It is, therefore, usually necessary to have two spotters when performing the squat.\nWith the foregoing in mind, a variety of prior art squat type exercise apparatuses have been developed to provide a safer environment for performing squats. Most of these apparatuses require that an individual partially squat into position such that his or her back and/or shoulders engage a user support member coupled to a source of resistance. Once the user is properly positioned relative to the user support member, he or she may move through an exercise routine. The user then moves from the user support member and steps away from the exercise apparatuses.\nConsidering these simple steps, the prior art is surprisingly filled with squat type exercise apparatuses which are difficult to use. For example, many squat type exercise apparatuses require users of different sizes to adapt to the apparatus itself rather than readily adjust for different size users. Where the squat type exercise apparatus does provide a mechanism for adjusting to suit users of differing sizes, prior art mechanisms are invariably difficult to use. While prior art squat type exercise apparatuses offer many set up challenges for users wishing to take advantages of the apparatuses, these prior art squat type exercise apparatuses are even more difficult to get out of once a user's exercise routine is completed.\nWith this in mind, the inventor has studied the prior squat type exercise apparatuses and determined that a need overwhelmingly exists for a squat type exercise apparatus offering users a convenient, adaptable and easy to use apparatus for performing squat type exercises. The inventor has, therefore, developed the present exercise apparatus overcoming the shortcomings of prior art devices."
