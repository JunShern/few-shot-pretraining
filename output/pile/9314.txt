In other words: as long as that B object is referenced from somewhere, it can't be collected. See here for example. \nIt absolutely does not matter here what code within the B class is doing. The only thing that matters is: is the B object still referenced from somewhere. In that sense you should rather study how GC works in general, see here for example.\n\n"
