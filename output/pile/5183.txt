For iOS that's not a problem, since any iPhone newer than the 5 has GLES 3. \nBut I am not sure how wide-spread GLES 3 is in the Android world or if all new devices support it. How can I determine how much support exists for GLES 3 so I can determine if I should use it or fall back to an older version?\n\nA:\n\nThe amount of how many devices support different APIs is usually easy to figure out by looking at public hardware stats of popular engines, such as unity and unreal. I recommend using multiple sources of stats to get better view of actual share of different device capabilities.\n\n"
