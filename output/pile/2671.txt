    "text": "I was born in 1946, just when the boomer wave began. Bill Clinton was born that year, too. So was George W. So was Laura Bush. And Ken Starr (remember him?) And then, the next year, Hillary Clinton. And soon Newt Gingrich (known as \u201cNewty\u201d as a boy). And Cher. Why so many of us begin getting born in 1946? Simple. My father was in World War II. He came home. My mother was waiting. Ditto for the others.\n\nSixty years later, we boomers have a lot to be worried about because most of us plan to retire in a few years and Social Security and Medicare are on the way to going bust. I should know because I used to be a trustee of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. Those of you who are younger than we early boomers have even more to be worried about because if those funds go bust they won\u2019t be there when you\u2019re ready to retire.\n\nIt\u2019s already starting to happen. This year Social Security will pay out more in benefits than it receives in payroll taxes. The tipping point came sooner than anyone expected because the recession has kicked so many people off payrolls. But it was coming anyway. And it adds new urgency to reforming Social Security \u2014 a task the president\u2019s commission on the nation\u2019s debt is focusing on.\n\nSo what\u2019s the answer?\n\nFed Chair Ben Bernanke this week listed the choices. \u201cTo avoid large and unsustainable budget deficits,\u201d he said in a speech on Wednesday, \u201cthe nation must choose among higher taxes, modifications to entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare, less spending on everything else from education to defense, or some combination of the above.\u201d\n\nBernanke is almost certainly right about \u201csome combination,\u201d but he leaves out one other possible remedy that should be included in that combination: Immigration.\n\nYou see, the biggest reason Social Security is in trouble, and Medicare as well, is because America is aging so fast. It\u2019s not just that so many boomers are retiring. It\u2019s also that seniors are living longer. And families are having fewer children.\n\nAdd it all up and the number of people who are working relative to the number who are retired keeps shrinking.\n\nForty years ago there were five workers for every retiree. Now there are three. Within a couple of decades, there will be only two workers per retiree. There\u2019s no way just two workers will be able or willing to pay enough payroll taxes to keep benefits flowing to every retiree.\n\nThis is where immigration comes in. Most immigrants are young because the impoverished countries they come from are demographically the opposite of rich countries. Rather than aging populations, their populations are bursting with young people.\n\nYes, I know: There aren\u2019t enough jobs right now even for Americans who want and need them. But once the American economy recovers, there will be. Take a long-term view and most new immigrants to the U.S. will be working for many decades.\n\nGet it? One logical way to deal with the crisis of funding Social Security and Medicare is to have more workers per retiree, and the simplest way to do that is to allow more immigrants into the United States.\n\nImmigration reform and entitlement reform have a lot to do with one another.\n\nAdd/view comments on this post.\n\n------------------------------\n\nThe Christian Science Monitor has assembled a diverse group of the best economy-related bloggers out there.
