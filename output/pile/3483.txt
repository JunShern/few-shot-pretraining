The almost 40 members present came up with many ideas and a great number of them signed up for one or more of the Working Groups initiated to make this an exciting event. The \"Entertainment\" and the \"PR & Social Media\" Working Groups will be the first to start their activities.\n\nWISTA Cyprus President, Despina Panayiotou Theodossiou, announced that in the last 3 months the Association signed up 13 new members, resulting in a total of almost 70 members in just a little over 2 years. She also looked back on the 2013 WISTA events, such as the presentation by GermanischerLloyd & Department of Merchant Shipping about MLC 2006, the Influence of the Environment in Salvage Operations by Svitzer Salvage, the busy Cocktail Reception during Maritime Cyprus and the motivating \"Leadership Seminar\" by the Copenhagen Business School.\n\nLooking forward to 2014 she mentioned that the main focus of the Association's energy and funds will now be on the organization of the International AGM & Conference, with the theme \"Shipping Connects\". The conference will take place from 8-10 October at the Four Seasons Hotel inLimassol and information can be found on the conference website: wistacyprus2014.com"
