    "text": "Forget what you learned about markets in your introductory economics class. In a new book titled, The Tyranny of the Market: Why You Can\u2019t Always Get What You Want, Wharton professor of business and public policy Joel Waldfogel challenges the conventional thinking that markets will provide adequately if left to their own devices.\n\nIn the prevailing view, markets allow everyone to get what they want, regardless of what others want \u2014 recalling Blockbuster Video\u2019s \u201cGo Home Happy\u201d slogan \u2014 while allocation through government imposes what John Stuart Mill called a \u201ctyranny of the majority\u201d \u2014 that you get what you want only if the majority wants it. This stark distinction between markets and government, advanced by Milton Friedman in his book Capitalism and Freedom, has been the rationale behind letting markets decide a wide variety of questions for decades. But according to Waldfogel, the tyranny of the majority is also at work in many markets, benefiting some, harming others, and not always ending up promoting efficiency.\n\nThe tyranny of the majority \u2014 Waldfogel calls it \u201cthe tyranny of the market\u201d \u2014 arises whenever two conditions hold. First, production entails substantial fixed costs; and second, preferences differ across groups of consumers. High fixed costs limit the number of products that markets can profitably offer, so that only large groups get appealing products. And when preferences differ across groups, then those not targeted \u2014 \u201cpreference minorities,\u201d in Waldfogel\u2019s words \u2014 are unable to go home happy.\n\nThe all-virtuous view of free markets is an influential one in contemporary policy making, often paired with a cynical view of government involvement. Waldfogel cites President George W. Bush\u2019s words on the occasion of Friedman\u2019s 90th birthday: \u201cMilton Friedman has shown us that when government attempts to substitute its own judgments for the judgments of free people, the results are usually disastrous. In contrast to the free market\u2019s invisible hand, which improves the lives of people,\u201d Bush continued, \u201cthe government\u2019s invisible foot tramples on people\u2019s hopes and destroys their dreams.\u201d\n\nWaldfogel offers a series of detailed empirical and case studies to counter that view. \u201cMy goal in this work is not so much to argue that Friedman is wrong,\u201d he writes, but to \u201cdemonstrate that Friedman\u2019s dichotomy between markets and collective choice is not right. In many markets, what I get depends on how many others also want it. Market allocation shares many of the features of allocation through collective choice.\u201d\n\nWaldfogel presents evidence suggesting \u201ca more nuanced view on the \u2018wonders of markets\u2019 and the \u2018evil of government.'\u201d His book makes the case that while markets do a good job of providing products that a majority of people demand, they can fall short in meeting the needs of consumers with less prevalent preferences. Potentially left by the wayside are African Americans, Hispanics, people with unusual medical conditions and residents of remote areas, to name a few groups.\n\nThe Misuse of Economics\n\nThe Tyranny of the Market is based on academic papers that Waldfogel wrote over the past decade. He says he has repeatedly made the argument to his fellow economists that markets share some messy features of politics and are far from perfect. Now he aims to bring the same ideas \u201cto people outside the narrow world of academic economics,\u201d a goal that meshes with his role over the past 18 months as the Dismal Science columnist at Slate.\n\nAccording to Waldfogel, his arguments, though \u201cnot revolutionary,\u201d buck the popular wisdom that government involvement in markets is automatically bad. \u201cEconomics has allowed itself to be used as a bludgeon in favor of free markets and against a government role, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what economics has to say,\u201d he suggests. \u201cLet\u2019s look at how markets actually work and then make our decisions.\u201d\n\nIn contrast to the Blockbuster Video conception of markets in which everyone goes home happy, Waldfogel\u2019s research shows many situations in which larger groups get more satisfaction, and smaller groups less, from markets. He first noticed this phenomenon about a decade ago when he was looking at radio-listening data broken down by racial groups. Blacks and whites have sharply different preferences in radio programming. The formats that attract most black listeners get almost no white listeners. A higher share of blacks listens to the radio in U.S. cities with larger black populations. This illustrates that having more people who share your tastes raises the number of products appealing to you, and your group gets more satisfaction from what\u2019s available.\n\nBut having more whites in the market does not raise the share of blacks listening to the radio, and having more blacks does not increase the share of whites listening. So while more demand generally helps bring forth more variety and more resulting satisfaction, your satisfaction really only increases when there are more people who share your preferences. This is a far cry, Waldfogel says, from the hypothetical situation where you can get what you want simply because you want it. Instead, you get what you want if enough other people also want it.\n\nDaily newspapers offer an even starker example. While your typical U.S. city has multiple radio stations, it has only one major newspaper. Newspaper preferences differ across groups, so the paper can be pitched to appeal to one group or another. As with radio, in cities with more whites, whites are more likely to read the paper, while blacks are more likely to read the paper in cities with more blacks. What\u2019s striking, Waldfogel says, is that blacks are less likely to subscribe in cities with larger white populations where the paper is pitched more toward white readers\u2019 tastes. Not only do you not get what you want simply because you want it, but you get something even less like what you want because others want something else. This is the tyranny of the majority translated almost literally into the market. Having more people who share your preferences helps you by making the product suit your tastes, and having more who do not actually hurts you by making the product less appealing to you.\n\nBecause these problems arise when fixed costs are large in relation to market size, they can be alleviated by increased market size \u2014 for example through trade across geographic areas \u2014 or through new technologies or managerial approaches that allow cheaper customization of products.\n\nA Preference for Action Movies\n\nThe book also explores the liberating effects of trade and the Internet, bringing desirable options to people who lack appealing local options. While trade goes some distance toward solving this group\u2019s problems, it is not a complete solution. \u201cInstead, with products that remain high in fixed costs even relative to the world market, exporting can shift products away from the preferences of the old domestic consumers,\u201d he says, and toward the preferences of the new market. Hollywood, for instance, has begun catering to customers in new-found movie markets, in some cases at the expense of the preferences of moviegoers in this country.\n\n\u201cHollywood has figured out that Japan and some parts of Europe are markets worth worrying about. And it\u2019s been observed lately that Hollywood has skewed products toward things that will export well, like action movies. If you like what Hollywood used to make \u2014 dramatic movies and movies with dialogue \u2014 you\u2019ll be less happy.\u201d\n\nWaldfogel says there are some business-to-the-rescue stories, where technology and other advances are addressing the downsides to the market. On-line booksellers and movie purveyors can offer more titles for a wider variety of tastes than your neighborhood book or video store. And pharmaceutical companies, traditionally focused on finding the next blockbuster drug, are envisioning a day when medicines can be specifically \u201cdesigned\u201d for individuals or smaller groups of people based on their genetic profiles. In restaurants, there is a trend for companies to locate several of their brands under one roof, allowing a family to eat items from Taco Bell and Pizza Hut at the same time.\n\nAll this criticism of markets raises the question of whether allocation through government is better or even different. \u201cIt\u2019s tough to find an apples-to-apples comparison of market and government allocation,\u201d Waldfogel says, \u201cbut one interesting comparison is between municipal public libraries and bookstores.\u201d Markets make bookstores available in rich and populous areas, while governments make libraries available in both populous and less populous areas, and local library availability is about equally sensitive to white and black populations. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that a decision to \u2018let the market decide\u2019 is good for some and not for others,\u201d he suggests.\n\nAccording to Waldfogel, there are no pat answers or simplistic formulas to determine the correct balance between free markets and government intervention. \u201cThe standard economist view of a subsidy is that it\u2019s venal, and there\u2019s often some truth to that,\u201d he says, adding, however, that the benevolent view of markets is over-stated, too. \u201cWhile it is true that in a perfectly competitive market, everything that should be done will be done and nothing that should not be done will be done, this expectation does not carry over to realistic, high fixed-cost examples. For people inclined to favor markets because of their efficiency properties, many real-world industries lack an efficiency rationale for a hands-off \u2014 or \u2018laissez-faire\u2019 \u2014 approach.\u201d Society, Waldfogel says, \u201cneeds to discuss the shortcomings of market allocation honestly \u2014 and with evidence \u2014 when choosing whether to let the market decide.\u201d"
