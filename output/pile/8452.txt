    "text": "2006 was the year of THE discovery, and Metal Storm was probably the first magazine to review Diablo Swing Orchestra and predict a wonderful future success to the band. I remember the day when I first listened to the band and said \"what the hell is that?\", for sure The Butcher's Ballroom was a great surprise and one of the most unexpected album of the last 10 years\u2026 I was awaiting a lot their new release, Sing-Along Songs For The Damned & Delirious, with a little fear to be honest, the level of the previous release being extremely high but now that I listened this release a lot of time, I can tell you that Diablo Swing Orchestra didn't miss the goal one more time!\n\nI'll quote myself this time:\n\"I like it even more than \"The Butcher's Ballroom\". They did all what I wanted them to do: become more aggressive, shorten the number of songs, more male singing, and more experimentation. Also they are more experienced musicians than before. They did it!\"\n\nTBB is a great album, really, but sometimes I find it too long, so, this one is well balanced. And c'mon, yes, the album is crazier, but they aren't at the Unexpect crazyness level, which a good thing for this band, they still have their very own sound.\n\nBTW, this guys are very nice, I met them last year and they were really kind to me and my friends.\n\nHuge disappointment after the The Butcher's Ballroom. Most of the songs are an unfocused mess, and Annlouice's vocals are really annoying, almost unbearable. I don't know why she changed her singing style, it was much more smooth on the previous album. I don't like the male opera singer either. The only good song is Stratosphere Serenade, because it's mostly instrumental\n\nThis group is a new discovery for me. I love what I heard from this album, although the vocals aren't particularly my favorite. Regardless, this is some damn fine music and very refreshing. Just what I needed to hear.\n\nTBB is a great album, really, but sometimes I find it too long, so, this one is well balanced. And c'mon, yes, the album is crazier, but they aren't at the Unexpect crazyness level, which a good thing for this band, they still have their very own sound."
