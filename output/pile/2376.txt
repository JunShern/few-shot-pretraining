If given a variable assignment in an example model, does this mean that (v) refers to all variables (d) that is in the universe, thus that all elements of the universe replaces the variable (v)?\ng1 =\nx1 \u2192 John\nx2 \u2192 Mary\nx3 \u2192 Pete\nxn \u2192 Pete\n(where n\u22654)\ng1[John/x3] =\nx1 \u2192 John\nx2 \u2192 Mary\nx3 \u2192 John\nxn \u2192 Pete (where n\u22654)\ng1[[John/x3]Pete/x1] =\nx1 \u2192 Pete\nx2 \u2192 Mary\nx3 \u2192 John\nxn \u2192 Pete (where n\u22654)\nAlso, I have an exercise based on variable assignment equivalence,  but I do not know how to approach answering these questions since I do not entirely understand the meaning of variable assignment, and modified variable assignment. \nQUESTION: Complete the equivalences assuming: g(x) = Mary, and g(y) = Susan.\n1.\ng[Paul/x)(x) =\n2.\ng[Paul/x)(y) =\n3.\ng[[Paul/x]Susan/x)(x) =\n4.\ng[[Paul/x]Susan/x)(y) =\n5.\ng[(Paul/x)Susan/y)(x) =\n6.\ng[[Paul/x]Susan/y)(y) =\nIf anyone could explain this concept to me, I would be very grateful!\nEDIT: sorry, i'm quite new to this site! the questions were cut off by the closed bracket. I've tried attempting the questions below.\n1.g[Paul/x)(x) = x: Paul\n2.g[Paul/x)(y) = y: Susan \n3.g[[Paul/x]Susan/x)(x) = x: Susan? \n4.g[[Paul/x]Susan/x)(y) = y: Susan? \n5.g[[Paul/x]Susan/y)(x) = x: Paul? \n6.g[[Paul/x]Susan/y)(y) = y: Susan? \nI'm a bit unsure about some of these, if x is originally mapped to Mary, then to Paul & Susan in (3&4)\n\nA:\n\nIf given a variable assignment in an example model, does this mean that (v) refers to all variables (d) that is in the universe, thus that all elements of the universe replaces the variable (v)?\n\nNo.  A variable assignment maps every variable to a specific individual. You can see that with your first example:\n\ng1 =\nx1 \u2192 John\nx2 \u2192 Mary\nx3 \u2192 Pete\nxn \u2192 Pete (where n\u22654)\n\nHowever, we can change those assignments when we do something like:\n\ng1[John/x3]\n\nThis means that everything gets assigned the same individual as above, except that we now map $x3$ to John, so we get:\n\ng1[John/x3] =\nx1 \u2192 John\nx2 \u2192 Mary\nx3 \u2192 John\nxn \u2192 Pete (where n\u22654)\n\nSo, for last exercise at the end, your initial g is:\ng  =\nx \u2192 Mary\ny \u2192 Susan\nSo that means that g[Paul/x] is:\ng[Paul/x] =\nx \u2192 Paul\ny \u2192 Susan\nCan you do the others?\n\n"
