Field of the Invention\nThe present invention relates to an audience response determination apparatus, a playback output control system, an audience response determination method and a playback output control method suitable for use in entertainment facilities where a large audience gathers for watching movies, concerts, plays, shows, sports events and various other events. The invention also relates to a recording medium suitable for realizing these apparatus and methods.\n2. Description of the Related Art\nA wide variety of entertainment is currently available, including movies, concerts, plays, shows, sports events and other events, where a large audience gathers. In response, techniques and equipment for increasing the level of satisfaction felt by the audience to the entertainment content have been called for and proposed.\nIt is generally the case that in movie theaters, concert halls and other places (hereafter collectively referred to as a hall) where an audience gathers for watching and/or listening to movies or various types of performance, the audience are expected to simply be there to passively watch or listen to the content being performed or shown.\nWhen the audience in the hall is large enough, they often display a greater response to the show or performance than in the case of watching or listening to similar content at home. This is due to what is known as mob psychology or a sense of being involved in the entertainment (the story, performers, players, etc.). Such responses include clapping of hands, cries, shouts, standing ovations, cheers, chorus, and gestures.\nIn response to those reactions shown by the audience, it is commonplace for the group of performers playing live music, for example, to voluntarily change the performance schedule or play encores so as to fuel the audience's excitement. However, in the case of movies or when the entertainment content cannot be easily changed, it has been difficult to pick up the audience's response and respond accordingly. It has also been difficult to adjust stage effects in response to the audience's reaction.\nIt is even more difficult to accurately pick up and judge the audience's overall response, given the fact that the audience comprise various types of people, some with loud voices and action, some without, some may be interested at the moment while some may be not, for example."
