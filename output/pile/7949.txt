    "text": "Main menu\n\nTag Archives: Assasin\n\nMy favorite kind of reading are multiple books, and T. C. Edge has a ten book series that I was excited to get to reading. Book One, The Enhanced, introduces us to a future dystopian earth where genetically modified humans (the Enhanced) live in the upper-crust of society while the rest (Unenhanced) live in the outskirts and are subjugated by the Enhanced.\n\nThe series follows a 19 year old orphan named Brie Melrose. She lives in a group home with her best friend, Tess, an over-sized clumsy boy, Drum, her caretaker, Mrs. Carmichael, along with several other kids with varying degrees of attitude. Brie finds herself under the scrutiny of the Sevants (the highest level of the Enhanced) which is exactly where she does not want to be.\n\nWithout giving any spoilers I won\u2019t go into any further details about this first book, or the other nine. (If you are desperate to know, you can go to the author\u2019s page and dive in.) I will, however, review this series as a whole, rather than taking each book one at a time.\n\nOverall, I liked this series. T.C. Edge has developed a world that is similar, yet very different from our own. For the most part it is a believable place, and the characters are well developed. The story itself carries the reader through with plenty of action and unexpected twists and turns.\n\nI did find myself skim reading a lot of the later books where the main character (Brie) has extensive internal debates and analysis of the world she lives in and the people she is close to. It became overly repetitive and if it had been condensed, ten good books would have made five fantastic books. I also took note of several misspelled words (this is in British English so I am not referring to those differences) along with grammar issues. A few more beta readers might have caught these. There were a couple of major issues that were not resolved by the end of the series. I may have missed something from skim reading, but because they were big holes I would have expected more than a few words to wrap these things up.\n\nWith that said, I do recommend these books. The story is a good one and the world T. C. has built is believable. Of the entire series my two favorite books were the first, The Enhanced, and the tenth, Renegade.\n\nHere is the full list of The Enhanced Series:\n\nThe Enhanced\n\nHybrid\n\nNameless\n\nAssassin\n\nAvenger\n\nDefender\n\nCaptive\n\nInvader\n\nRenegade\n\n**One final advisory word to the youngest readers; these books do have intense battle scenes which may not be suited for the more sensitive reader."
