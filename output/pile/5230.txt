He approached a group that included [Richard A.]\n      Cook, [Fidel L.] Cosby and [Appellant] that was gathered outside\n      the building. Williams was informed by someone in the group\n      where to locate his friend and he left for that location. Williams\n      returned shortly thereafter and for reasons that are unclear had\n      an altercation with one person in the group and was struck by\n      that person or someone else in the group. Williams then walked\n      away toward Grandinetti Avenue. While Williams was standing\n      near Grandinetti Avenue, Cook, Cosby, and [Appellant] drew\n      handguns and began firing at him.\n             Williams fled toward Daniel Street while the three\n      continued firing. Williams\u2019 body was eventually found a short\n      distance up a hill near Daniel Street. An autopsy revealed that\n      Williams was struck multiple times with rounds from different\n      caliber handguns with the fatal shot being a back to front\n      through and through that passed his heart and lung. This round\n      was never recovered. Eyewitnesses stated that [Appellant] was\n      firing a semi-automatic handgun with silver on top, Cook was\n      firing a revolver, and Cosby was firing a larger semi-automatic\n      handgun with a laser sight. Detectives from the Johnstown\n      Police Department (JPD) were eventually able to locate and\n      arrest all three suspects. During interviews Cook admitted to\n      being present at the scene, to possessing a .22 caliber revolver\n      that night, to seeing [Appellant] pull a handgun, to seeing\n      [Appellant] firing at Williams, and to drawing his own revolver.\n      Cook stated that he did not recall firing his weapon that night.\n\nTrial Court Opinion, filed 3/1/16, at 3-4.\n\n      Appellant initially was charged in a Criminal Complaint on July 15,\n\n2014, as a \u201cprinciple [sic] or accomplice\u201d of criminal homicide in the death of\n\nMr. Williams.   In the Criminal Information filed on November 21, 2014,\n\nAppellant was charged as \u201cthe Actor\u201d in the homicide.          Thereafter, on\n\nSeptember 17, 2015, the Commonwealth filed an Amended Information\n\nwherein Appellant was charged as \u201ca principal or accomplice.\u201d Appellant\n\nchallenged the amendment, and following a hearing on September 21, 2015,\n\non this issue and other pretrial motions, the trial court permitted the\n\n                                      -2-\n\fJ-S86011-16\n\n\nCriminal Information to be amended. In doing so, the trial court reasoned\n\nAppellant had not been surprised or prejudiced since the matter had been\n\nviewed from the outset as one wherein the codefendants acted in concert.\n\nN.T., 9/21/15, at 26-27.\n\n        The Commonwealth filed a Motion for Consolidation on July 7, 2015,\n\nand Appellant filed a Motion to Sever under Pa.R.Crim.P. 583.2 Following the\n\nConsolidation Hearing held on September 11, 2015, at which Appellant\n\nopposed the Commonwealth\u2019s Motion to Consolidate, the trial court granted\n\nthe Commonwealth\u2019s motion and denied Appellant\u2019s motion to sever.3\n\n        On September 22, 2015, the day upon which jury selection was\n\nscheduled to begin, Appellant and his codefendants entered guilty pleas and\n\nagreed to waive their right to withdraw those pleas.4           Sentencing was\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n2\n    This Rule states that:\n\n               The court may order separate trials of offenses or\n        defendants, or provide other appropriate relief, if it appears that\n        any party may be prejudiced by offenses or defendants being\n        tried together.\n\nPa.R.Crim.P 583.\n3\n While the Docket Entries indicate an Order was entered denying Appellant\u2019s\nMotion to Sever on September 11, 2015, no corresponding written motion\nappears in the certified record.\n4\n  While Appellant initially hesitated to enter into a plea due to the fact he\nhad not been promised a definitive period of incarceration, following a\ndetailed discussion with his counsel and the trial court, Appellant eventually\ndecided to plead guilty. N.T. Guilty Plea, 9/22/15, at 4-10.\n\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\fJ-S86011-16\n\n\nscheduled for November 3, 2015; however, on November 2, 2015, Appellant\n\nfiled his \u201cMotion for Withdrawal of Guilty Plea\u201d wherein he alleged, inter alia,\n\nthat:    \u201cthere is a fair and just reason that he should be permitted to\n\nwithdraw his guilty pleas as he avers he that he is not guilty of the alleged\n\noffenses, and further avers that he was under great pressure and not\n\nthinking clearly when he entered his guilty pleas. . . . \u201d             See Motion to\n\nVacate Guilty Plea, filed 11/2/15, at \u00b6 3.\n\n        On November 3, 2015, the trial court denied Appellant\u2019s motion and\n\nsentenced him to a period of incarceration of two hundred four (204) months\n\nto four hundred eighty (480) months in prison on the third-degree murder\n\ncharge and to a consecutive term of forty-eight (48) months\u2019 to one hundred\n\ntwenty     (120)    months\u2019     incarceration    on   the   firearms   charge.   N.T.\n\nSentencing, 11/3/15, at 52-53.           Appellant filed a post-sentence motion to\n\nmodify his sentence, and following a hearing, the trial court denied the same\n\non December 22, 2015.\n\n        On December 29, 2015, Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal. 5 On\n\nJanuary 6, 2016, the trial court ordered Appellant to file a concise statement\n\nof matters complained of on appeal pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b), and\n\nAppellant filed the same on January 29, 2016, wherein he raised five claims.\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n5\n  Codefendant Richard A. Cook\u2019s appeal from his judgment of sentence is\npending in this Court. See Commonwealth v. Cook, 5 WDA 2016.\n\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\fJ-S86011-16\n\n\nThe trial court filed its opinion pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a) on March 1,\n\n2016.\n\n        Appellant now presents the following Statement of Questions Involved:\n\n        1.    Did the [t]rial [c]ourt commit reversible error when it\n        granted the Commonwealth\u2019s request to consolidate the trials of\n        Fidel Cosby, Richard Cook and [ ] [A]ppellant [] over objection\n        from Appellant[?]\n\n        2.    Did the [t]rial [j]udge commit reversible error by allowing\n        the Commonwealth [to] file an amended Criminal Information\n        over objection from [Appellant] on 09/17/15 when jury selection\n        was scheduled to begin on 09/22/15[?]\n\n        3.    Did the [t]rial [j]udge commit reversible error by not\n        continuing the trial to give the [Appellant] additional time to\n        prepare for trial based on the material change in the Information\n        set forth in paragraph 2 above[?]\n\n        4.    Did the [t]rial [c]ourt err in denying [Appellant\u2019s] pre-\n        sentence motion to withdraw his guilty plea where he asserted a\n        plausible claim of innocence?\n\n        5.   Did the [c]ourt err in sentencing [Appellant] to an\n        aggregate twenty-one (21) to fifty year period of incarceration?\n\n\nBrief for Appellant at 5.\n\n        Appellant first maintains the trial court erred in granting the\n\nCommonwealth\u2019s motion to consolidate the trials of Appellant and his\n\ncodefendants. Appellant relies upon Pa.R.CrimP. 582(B)(1) and (2) to\n\nsupport his claim that the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to file a written Notice of\n\nJoinder prior to formal arraignment on November 25, 2014, and its failure to\n\nfile a motion for consolidation as part of an omnibus pretrial motion within\n\nthirty days of formal arraignment rendered its motion untimely and,\n\n                                      -5-\n\fJ-S86011-16\n\n\ntherefore, the trial court should have denied it on procedural grounds. Brief\n\nfor Appellant at 11-12. Appellant further notes Pa.R.Crim.P. 583 provides\n\nthat where it appears a party may be prejudiced if offenses or defendants\n\nare tried together, the trial court may order separate trials.          Appellant\n\nmaintains \u201c[a] problem of constitutional proportions arises in joint trials\n\nwhen the prosecutor seeks to offer into evidence a confession of one\n\ndefendant which implicates another,\u201d and that herein, while he did not make\n\na confession, Appellant\u2019s codefendant Cook clearly implicated Appellant as\n\nthe shooter such that Appellant had been denied his rights under the\n\n\u201cconfrontation clause.\u201d Id. at 13. Appellant reasons that were a trial held,\n\nbased upon the evidence the Commonwealth would have presented and the\n\ncomplex nature of the case, the jury could not have separated such evidence\n\nand likely would have convicted all three defendants as it \u201cwould have been\n\nunable to determine who fired the fatal shot, and all three would have or\n\ncould have been unjustly convicted of 1st Degree Murder.\u201d          Id. at 13-14.\n\nFinally, Appellant claims that while his codefendants made statements which\n\ncould be introduced against them, such statements would constitute\n\ninadmissible hearsay against Appellant, who did not make a statement, and\n\nthat evidence would be unfairly prejudicial to him at a joint trial. Id.\n\n      Initially, we note it is well-settled that the decision to join or sever\n\noffenses for trial is within the trial court\u2019s discretion and will not be reversed\n\non appeal absent a manifest abuse thereof or a showing of prejudice or clear\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fJ-S86011-16\n\n\ninjustice to the defendant.   Commonwealth v. Wholaver, 605 Pa. 325,\n\n351, 989 A.2d 883, 898 (2010). Herein, the trial court reasoned that\n\nnumerous factors, including the fact that the charges against Appellant and\n\nhis codefendants arose from the same course of events and the same\n\nwitnesses would be called in the trial of each, militated in favor of joinder.\n\nTrial Court Opinion, filed 3/1/16, at 7. In addition, the trial court determined\n\nAppellant could not meet the standard to prove prejudice, because the\n\ncharges were not so numerous or disparate that a properly-instructed jury\n\nwould have been rendered unable to separate the evidence against each\n\ndefendant. Id. at 7-8. In addition, the trial court pointed out that whether\n\nthe statements of Appellant\u2019s codefendants would have been admitted into\n\nevidence never had been determined, and Appellant could have sought at\n\ntrial to limit what portions thereof the Commonwealth might introduce. Id.\n\nat 8. Further, the trial court found Appellant had not been prejudiced by the\n\nCommonwealth\u2019s motion, since all pretrial proceedings involved all three\n\ndefendants, and nothing in the Pennsylvania Rules of Procedure places a\n\ndeadline on the Commonwealth for filing a motion to consolidate. Id. at 9.\n\n      As the trial court stated, Rule 582(B)(2) provides that a motion to\n\nconsolidate \u201cmust ordinarily be included in the omnibus pretrial motion.\u201d\n\nPa.R.Crim.P. 582(B)(2) (emphasis added). The use of the word \u201cordinarily\u201d\n\nplainly indicates that while motions to consolidate should normally be\n\nincluded in an omnibus pretrial motion, the rule is not absolute, and there\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fJ-S86011-16\n\n\nare certain circumstances where a motion to consolidate will be considered\n\noutside of an omnibus motion. This Court will not make a rule absolute when\n\nthe plain language does not purport to do so; thus, under the facts\n\npresented herein, where Commonwealth filed its motion several weeks\n\nbefore trial and each pretrial proceeding involved all three defendants, we\n\nfind the trial court did not err by considering the Commonwealth\u2019s motion.\n\n      The   timeliness   of   the   Commonwealth\u2019s    motion   aside,   we   find\n\nAppellant\u2019s challenge to be moot as Appellant and his codefendants entered\n\nguilty pleas prior to trial; thus, there was no joint trial at which Appellant\n\nwas subjected to prejudice. Indeed, Appellant speaks in terms of the\n\nprejudice that might have or would have befallen him had trial occurred and\n\nif statements of codefendants Cook and Cosby were introduced into\n\nevidence. Brief for Appellant at 13-14. \u201cA defendant requesting a separate\n\ntrial must show real potential for prejudice rather than mere speculation.\u201d\n\nCommonwealth v. Serrano, 61 A.3d 279, 285 (Pa.Super. 2013) (citation\n\nomitted). As such, the trial court correctly determined Appellant simply\n\ncannot show that he was prejudiced by its decision to consolidate the\n\nmatters for trial. This claim, therefore, does not warrant relief.\n\n      In his second and third issues, Appellant argues the trial court\n\ncommitted reversible error by permitting the Commonwealth to amend the\n\nCriminal Information several days prior to the date upon which trial was\n\nscheduled to commence without providing Appellant with additional time to\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fJ-S86011-16\n\n\nprepare a defense for trial based upon the alleged material change.\n\nSpecifically, Appellant explains that while the original Criminal Complaint\n\nfiled on July 15, 2014, named him as an actor or accomplice in the death of\n\nTyrone Williams, the Criminal Information filed on November 21, 2014,\n\ncharged him only as the principal actor; thus, Appellant and his counsel\n\nprepared for trial based upon the Criminal Information. Brief for Appellant at\n\n14.   Appellant maintains that the Commonwealth\u2019s Amended Information\n\nfiled on September 17, 2015, alleging he acted either as a principal or as an\n\naccomplice was impermissible as it clearly expanded and changed the nature\n\nof the offense. Id. at 15-16. While he admits he never sought to have his\n\ntrial continued, Appellant reasons the trial court may have sua sponte\n\ngranted a continuance pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 106.6 Appellant posits that\n\nin light of the gravity of the charged offenses, the trial court should have\n\ncontinued the trial in the interests of justice to allow such a young man more\n\ntime to make an informed decision to enter a guilty plea or proceed to trial.\n\nId. at 17-18.7\n\n       Pa.R.Crim.P. 564 states:\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n6\n  This rule provides in relevant part that: \u201c[t]he court or issuing authority\nmay, in the interests of justice, grant a continuance, on its own motion, or\non the motion of either party.\u201d Pa.R.Crim.P. 106 (A).\n7\n Prior to pleading guilty, Appellant indicated he was twenty years old. N.T.\nGuilty Plea, 9/22/15, at 20.\n\n\n\n                                           -9-\n\fJ-S86011-16\n\n\n      The court may allow an information to be amended when there\n      is a defect in form, the description of the offense(s), the\n      description of any person or any property, or the date charged,\n      provided the information as amended does not charge an\n      additional or different offense. Upon amendment, the court may\n      grant such postponement of trial or other relief as is necessary\n      in the interests of justice.\n\nPa.R.Crim.P. 564. Additionally,\n\n      [i]n reviewing a grant to amend an information, the Court will\n      look to whether the appellant was fully apprised of the factual\n      scenario which supports the charges against him. Where the\n      crimes specified in the original information involved the same\n      basis elements and arose out of the same factual situation as the\n      crime added by the amendment, the appellant is deemed to\n      have been placed on notice regarding his alleged criminal\n      conduct and no prejudice to defendant results.\n\nCommonwealth v. Mentzer, 18 A.3d 1200, 1202\u201303 (Pa.Super. 2011)\n\n(citation omitted).\n\n      Herein, as has been stated above, the Criminal Complaint filed on July\n\n15, 2014, charged Appellant as both the principal and accomplice to the\n\noffenses of homicide and aggravated assault. The Commonwealth explained\n\nthat although the charge was \u201ctyped over defectively by the [District\n\nAttorney\u2019s] office,\u201d N.T., 9/21/15 at 25, its theory of the case never\n\nchanged. The Commonwealth stressed that from the time of the preliminary\n\nhearing held on October 1, 2014, Appellant was aware he was charged with\n\nacting as an accomplice to his and his codefendants. Brief for Appellee at 9\n\n\n\n\n                                   - 10 -\n\fJ-S86011-16\n\n\nciting N.T. Preliminary Hearing, 10/1/14, at 118-19.8    Indeed, Appellant\n\nadduced no evidence at the September 21, 2015, hearing that he was\n\nprejudiced by the amendment.\n\n       Even if he had, it is clear that Appellant and his counsel were well\n\naware of the charges, as they negotiated a plea bargain with the\n\nCommonwealth, and the plea colloquy included a recitation of the facts\n\nalleged as well as stated the criminal charges. Appellant also was reminded\n\nthat no promises regarding his sentence had been made.       We read such\n\nconduct by Appellant as a knowing acquiesce in the technical error and\n\nconclude that the Commonwealth provided Appellant with a sufficiently\n\nspecific accusation of the crimes charged, as upon pleading guilty a\n\ndefendant admits to all of the facts averred in the indictment. See\n\nCommonwealth, Department of Transportation v. Mitchell, 517 Pa.\n\n203, 212, 535 A.2d 581, 585 (1987) (plurality). See also Commonwealth\n\nv. Montgomery, 485 Pa. 110, 114, 401 A.2d 318, 319 (1979) (stating that\n\na guilty plea constitutes a waiver of all nonjurisdictional defects and\n\ndefenses and stressing that a defendant who pleads guilty waives the right\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n8\n  Appellant has not provided the notes of testimony of the preliminary\nhearing for our review. \u201cIt is the obligation of the appellant to make sure\nthat the record forwarded to an appellate court contains those documents\nnecessary to allow a complete and judicious assessment of the issues raised\non appeal.\u201d Hrinkevich v. Hrinkevich, 676 A.2d 237, 240 (Pa.Super.\n1996) (citation omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                          - 11 -\n\fJ-S86011-16\n\n\nto challenge anything but the legality of his sentence and the validity of his\n\nplea). Thus, despite the technical flaw, the trial court did not err in its\n\ndecision to permit the Commonwealth to amend the information.\n\n      With regard to Appellant\u2019s claim the trial court erred by failing to sua\n\nsponte continue his scheduled trial in light of its decision to allow the\n\nCommonwealth to amend the Criminal Information, we note that it was not\n\nrequired to do so under Pa.R.Crim.P. 564. Also, Appellant admits he never\n\nsought a continuance either orally or in writing, and our review of the record\n\nconfirms he neither requested additional time nor objected on the record\n\nafter the trial court found the Amended Information did not result in\n\nprejudice or unfair surprise to Appellant and his codefendants. See Brief for\n\nAppellant at 17; N.T., 9/21/15, at 27. To the contrary, Appellant asked only\n\nthat the accomplice liability language be stricken from the Amended\n\nInformation so that he may \u201cproceed with trial tomorrow on the original\n\ncharge that he was charged with some nine months ago.\u201d N.T., 9/21/15, at\n\n17.\n\n      On Appeal, Appellant has proffered only a bald assertion he was\n\nprejudiced by the amendment and failed to assert how he would have\n\nprepared differently for trial had a continuance been granted sua sponte.\n\nAccordingly, Appellant has waived this claim.       See Commonwealth v.\n\nHouck, 102 A.3d 443, 451 (Pa.Super. 2014) (stating, \u201cthe failure to make\n\na timely and specific objection before the trial court at the appropriate stage\n\n\n                                    - 12 -\n\fJ-S86011-16\n\n\nof the proceedings will result in waiver of the issue.\u201d (citation omitted));\n\nPa.R.A.P. 302(a) (stating an issue not raised in the trial court is considered\n\nwaived for purposes of appellate review).\n\n      In his fourth claim, Appellant avers the trial court erred in denying his\n\npre-sentence motion to withdraw his guilty plea filed on November 2, 2015,\n\nin light of his assertion of a plausible claim of innocence. In support of this\n\nclaim, Appellant argues that through his counsel he asserted at the\n\nsentencing hearing he was \u201cnot guilty of this offense\u201d and was under a\n\n\u201cgreat deal of pressure\u201d when he entered his plea and \u201csaid things that were\n\nnot accurate.\u201d Brief for Appellant at 20. He claims that his confusion arose,\n\nin part, from his inability to discuss with counsel the ramifications of the\n\nCommonwealth\u2019s amendment to the Criminal Information to include a theory\n\nof accomplice liability. Id. citing N.T. Sentencing, 11/03/15, at 5-6. Relying\n\nupon Commonwealth v. Carrasquillo, 631 Pa. 692, 115 A.3d 1284\n\n(2015), Appellant reasons that \u201cgiven the unique situation that [he] was\n\nplaced in the day of jury selection, i.e. the delayed Amended Information,\n\n[he] stated fair and just reasons for his desire to withdraw his guilty plea,\n\nand said request should have been granted by the trial judge.\u201d        Brief for\n\nAppellant at 20.   Acknowledging the fact that he had agreed to waive his\n\nopportunity to withdraw his guilty plea, Appellant posits he should not be\n\nprevented from exercising his right to do so notwithstanding.        Appellant\n\nstresses he had entered an open plea and that the Commonwealth would\n\n\n                                    - 13 -\n\fJ-S86011-16\n\n\nhave had difficulty proving him guilty of first-degree murder beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt. Id. at 21-22.\n\n     Under Pa.R.Crim.P. 591, a trial court may, in its discretion, allow a\n\ndefendant to withdraw a guilty plea at any time before his sentence is\n\nimposed. Pa.R.Crim.P. 591(A) (\u201cAt any time before the imposition of\n\nsentence, the court may, in its discretion, permit, upon motion of the\n\ndefendant, or direct, sua sponte, the withdrawal of a plea of guilty or nolo\n\ncontendere and the substitution of a plea of not guilty.\u201d). The standard of\n\nreview that we employ in challenges to a trial court's decision regarding a\n\npre-sentence motion to withdraw a guilty plea is well-settled:\n\n     A trial court's decision regarding whether to permit a guilty plea\n     to be withdrawn should not be upset absent an abuse of\n     discretion. An abuse of discretion exists when a defendant shows\n     any fair and just reasons for withdrawing his plea absent\n     substantial prejudice to the Commonwealth. In its discretion, a\n     trial court may grant a motion for the withdrawal of a guilty plea\n     at any time before the imposition of sentence. Although there is\n     no absolute right to withdraw a guilty plea, properly received by\n     the trial court, it is clear that a request made before sentencing\n     should be liberally allowed. The policy underlying this liberal\n     exercise of discretion is well-established: The trial courts in\n     exercising their discretion must recognize that before judgment,\n     the courts should show solicitude for a defendant who wishes to\n     undo a waiver of all constitutional rights that surround the right\n     to trial\u2014perhaps the most devastating waiver possible under our\n     constitution. In [Commonwealth v.]Forbes, [299 A.2d 268 (Pa.\n     1973)] our Supreme Court instructed that, in determining\n     whether to grant a pre[-]sentence motion for withdrawal of a\n     guilty plea, the test to be applied by the trial courts is fairness\n     and justice.\n\n\n\n\n                                    - 14 -\n\fJ-S86011-16\n\n\nCommonwealth v. Elia, 83 A.3d 254, 261\u2013262 (Pa.Super. 2013) (internal\n\nquotations and citations omitted).             In addition, our Supreme Court in\n\nCarrasquillo recently reaffirmed the Forbes ruling, stating:\n\n       there is no absolute right to withdraw a guilty plea; trial courts\n       have discretion in determining whether a withdrawal request will\n       be granted; such discretion is to be administered liberally in\n       favor of the accused; and any demonstration by a defendant of a\n       fair-and-just reason will suffice to support a grant, unless\n       withdrawal    would    work    substantial  prejudice    to    the\n       Commonwealth.\n\nCarrasquillo, 631 Pa. at 704, 115 A.3d at 1291\u20131292 (footnote omitted).\n\n       In Carrasquillo the Supreme Court also declared a defendant's\n\ninnocence claim must be at least plausible to demonstrate, in and of itself, a\n\nfair and just reason for pre-sentence withdrawal of a plea. Carrasquillo,\n\n631 Pa. at 704, 115 A.3d at 1292.9 The Court concluded that a per se\n\napproach to allowing a pre-sentence withdrawal of a guilty plea on one\u2019s\n\nmere assertion of his innocence is unsatisfactory. Id. It further noted that\n\nin evaluating a pre-sentence request to withdraw a guilty plea, courts could\n\nconsider the timing of the innocence claim. Carrasquillo., 631 Pa. at 705,\n\n115 A.3d at 1292 citing Commonwealth v. Forbes, 450 Pa. 185, 192, 299\n\nA.2d 268, 272 (1973) (\u201cObviously, the appellant, by his assertion of\n\ninnocence\u2014so early in the proceedings, i.e., one month after the initial\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n9\n  The Supreme Court arrived at the same conclusion in a companion case,\nCommonwealth v. Hvizda, ___ Pa. ____, 116 A.3d 1103 (2015), decided\nthe same day.\n\n\n\n                                          - 15 -\n\fJ-S86011-16\n\n\ntender of a plea,\u2014offered a \u2018fair and just\u2019 reason for withdrawal of the\n\nplea.\u201d) (brackets omitted).\n\n      In considering this issue, the trial court stressed that Appellant had\n\nindicated when entering his guilty plea he was aware jurors and all parties\n\nwere ready for trial and understood he was, therefore, giving up his right to\n\nwithdraw his plea. The trial court explained it had informed Appellant that it\n\nwould not grant such a motion were Appellant to file one \u201cbetween now and\n\nat the time of [his] sentencing.\u201d    Trial Court Opinion, filed 3/1/16, at 12\n\nciting N.T. Guilty Plea, 9/22/15, at 15. Accordingly, the trial court reasoned\n\nthat since Appellant had waived his right to withdraw his guilty plea, it did\n\nnot err in denying his subsequent motion. Id. at 14.\n\n      In the alternative, the trial court asserted that even if Appellant had\n\nnot waived his right to withdraw his plea, he could not have been entitled to\n\ndo so for his failure to present a plausible claim of innocence or colorable\n\ndemonstration that permitting withdrawal of the plea would promote fairness\n\nand justice in this matter as is required under Carrasquillo and Hvizda.\n\nThe trial court reasoned that:\n\n      the evidence presented at the preliminary hearing clearly\n      place[s] him at the scene of the murder with a weapon in his\n      hand firing at Williams. Further, eyewitness testimony was that\n      [Appellant], along with Cook and Cosby continued to fire at\n      Williams as he fled. Viewing [Appellant\u2019s] claim against the\n      totality of the evidence available reveals that his claim of\n      innocence is implausible under the factual circumstances of this\n      case.\n\nTrial Court Opinion, filed 3/1/16, at 15.\n\n\n                                     - 16 -\n\fJ-S86011-16\n\n\n\n      Initially, we note that this Court has held a trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion when it found a defendant waived his right to withdraw a guilty\n\nplea prior to sentencing where the defendant had entered an open plea and\n\nlater asserted his innocence, and where there was no alleged prejudice to\n\nthe Commonwealth if the plea were to be withdrawn. Commonwealth v.\n\nPardo, 35 A.3d 1222, 1224 (Pa.Super. 2011). We further have held that in\n\nkeeping with the dictates of Pa.R.Crim.P. 590 and 591 and our Supreme\n\nCourt's liberal standard of granting pre-sentence requests to withdraw guilty\n\npleas, a trial court may not \u201ccurtail a defendant's ability to withdraw his\n\nguilty plea via a boilerplate statement of waiver in a written guilty plea\n\ncolloquy.\u201d Id. In light of the foregoing, while we acknowledge the\n\nCommonwealth\u2019s position that the waiver in this case was not a boilerplate\n\nwaiver but, rather, was attendant to jury selection, Brief for Appellee at 16,\n\nwe decline under the facts of this case to find Appellant waived his right to\n\nwithdraw    his   guilty   plea.   However,    relying   on   the   most   recent\n\npronouncements of our Supreme Court in Carrasquillo and Hvizda, we find\n\nno abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court in concluding, in the\n\nalternative, that Appellant failed to assert a plausible claim of innocence or\n\nto show that permitting withdrawal of the plea would promote fairness and\n\njustice herein.\n\n      Appellant entered his guilty plea on September 22, 2015, yet he did\n\nnot file his motion to withdraw his plea until November 2, 2015, the day\n\nbefore his scheduled sentencing.       Therein, he simply averred \u201che is not\n\n                                      - 17 -\n\fJ-S86011-16\n\n\n\nguilty of the alleged offenses,\u201d and that \u201che was under great pressure and\n\nnot thinking clearly when he entered his guilty pleas on the above\n\nreferenced date.\u201d See Motion for Withdrawal of Guilty Plea, filed November\n\n2, 2015, at \u00b6 3. Such assertions in a last minute motion to withdraw a guilty\n\nplea do not amount to a colorable claim of innocence or suggest Appellant\n\nshould have been permitted to withdraw his plea in the interest of justice.\n\n       To the contrary, prior to filing his motion, Appellant prepared a written\n\ncolloquy, and the trial court conducted an extensive discussion with\n\nAppellant in response to the latter\u2019s inquiry as to what his sentence might\n\nbe.   N.T. Guilty Plea, 9/22/15, at 5-6.           During this time, the trial court\n\nexplained to Appellant the potential for a life imprisonment sentence should\n\na jury convict him of first-degree murder and the ramifications of the\n\nproffered plea agreement. N.T. Guilty Plea, 9/22/15, at 5-8. Therefore, we\n\nfind the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it refused Appellant\u2019s\n\nattempted withdrawal of his plea.10\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n10\n   Because Appellant did not demonstrate this prerequisite, we need not\nconsider whether the withdrawal of his plea would substantially prejudice the\nCommonwealth. See Carrasquillo, supra, 115 A.3d at 1293 n. 9.\nNotwithstanding, in reliance on the tendered pleas, witnesses and jurors who\nwere present to participate in Appellant\u2019s trial on September 22, 2015, were\ndismissed. Our Supreme Court has found substantial prejudice and affirmed\nthe denial of a defendant\u2019s pre-sentence motion to withdraw his guilty plea\nwhere the Commonwealth dismissed numerous key witnesses in reliance\nupon the plea. Commonwealth v. Ross, 498 Pa. 512, 447 A.2d 943\n(1982).\n\n\n\n\n                                          - 18 -\n\fJ-S86011-16\n\n\n       Finally, in an argument which consists of just one statement, Appellant\n\navers his sentence was excessive and that the trial court failed to consider\n\nhis age, his expression of remorse and the psychological report he submitted\n\nin his post-sentence motion prior to sentencing. Upon noting it never had\n\nviewed Appellant\u2019s brief and, therefore, could not discern whether the\n\naverments he made therein met the standard set forth in Pa.R.A.P. 2119(f),\n\nthe trial court assumed, arguendo, the brief was not defective and that\n\nAppellant had raised a substantial question permitting appellate review.\n\nNotwithstanding, the trial court proceeded to determine this issue lacked\n\nmerit and explained it properly had considered the Sentencing Guidelines,\n\nAppellant\u2019s Pre-sentence Investigation (PSI) report, mitigating factors, and\n\nthe circumstances surrounding the crimes when fashioning Appellant\u2019s\n\nsentence which fell within the standard range of the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\nUpon our review, we find Appellant has waived this issue.\n\n       A claim the trial court failed to consider mitigating factors implicates\n\nthe discretionary aspects of one\u2019s sentence.11 See Commonwealth v.\n\nRaven, 97 A.3d 1244, 1252 (Pa.Super. 2014) (a claim that the sentencing\n\ncourt failed to consider mitigating factors when imposing sentence is a\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n11\n   Open plea agreements do not preclude a defendant from appealing the\ndiscretionary aspects of his sentence. See Commonwealth v. Tirado, 870\nA.2d 362, 365 n. 5 (Pa.Super. 2005).\n\n\n\n\n                                          - 19 -\n\fJ-S86011-16\n\n\nchallenge to the discretionary aspects of one's sentence). It is well-settled\n\nthat a challenge to the discretionary aspects of one\u2019s sentence must be\n\ntreated as a petition for permission to appeal, as the right to pursue such a\n\nclaim is not absolute. Id. When considering an appellant\u2019s challenge to the\n\ndiscretionary aspects of his sentence, we conduct a four-part analysis to\n\ndetermine:\n\n       (1) whether appellant has filed a timely notice of appeal, see\n       Pa.R.A.P. 902 and 903; (2) whether the issue was properly\n       preserved at sentencing or in a motion to reconsider and modify\n       sentence, see Pa.R.Crim.P. [720]; (3) whether appellant's brief\n       has a fatal defect, Pa.R.A.P. 2119(f); and (4) whether there is a\n       substantial question that the sentence appealed from is not\n       appropriate under the Sentencing Code, 42.

However, Appellant\u2019s brief fails to include the requisite\n\nRule 2119(f) statement, and the Commonwealth has objected to this\n\ndeficiency. \u201cBecause the Appellant failed to comply with Pa.R.A.P. 2119(f)\n\nand the Commonwealth objected to the omission, this Court may not review\n\nthe merits of the claim[.]\u201d Commonwealth v.
