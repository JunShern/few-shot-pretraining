I think the question that is yet to be resolved is \"On whose part?\" Because I'm not so sure that this can be blamed on someone who was \"new to the job\". Judging from what I found on their own web site, she was merely handing out the company line.\n\nHostess Brands, a maker of snack foods for 80+ years, is calling it quits. It seems that 2 trips through Chapter 11, intransigent labor unions and I suspect a certain amount of shrugging came together and led the privately held company to begin shutting down operations and selling off the bits.\n\nWednesday, November 14, 2012\n\nIt seems that the Wounded Warrior Project still isn't getting it. Lifting a page from the Zumbo Affair, they have issued an official unapology. Lifted in it's entirety from their Facebook page:\n\nWe've had a lot of questions recently that\nstarted when we declined an opportunity to appear on Gun Talk Radio. We\nwant to clarify and help answer some questions. We have seen through\nthis process that the language on our website and our response to the\ninvitation to appear on the show weren\u2019t clear, and we are working on\nclarifying our approach. There is now much inaccurate information about\nWWP being anti-gun rights, an issue as\nan apolitical organization we do not take a stance on. We understand\nand appreciate that many of our Alumni are gun owners, and we facilitate\nmultiple hunting and outdoor opportunities for our Wounded Warriors\nthroughout the year.\n\nIn the past, we made our logo available\nto appear on wide variety of products, including guns. As an\norganization, we owe it to our donors and constituents to maximize the\nreturn on investment of our dollars and brand. We are always looking at\nour business practices and whether we should continue with them in the\nfuture. In the case of cobranding, we've decided that we're not going to\noffer our logo to appear on weapons anymore - whether they're guns,\nknives, bows, swords, or any other type of weapon. There are still a few\nof the guns around for sale that had licensed our logo years ago, but\nthere aren't any new ones being made. This is purely a business\ndecision based on a review of a return on investment, especially when\ncompared with other types of cobranding ventures.\n\nRegarding\nthe question of donations and events, we do permit fundraisers that are\nshooting- and gun-related, such as gun raffles, shooting competitions,\netc., and we're incredibly appreciative of those who are willing to give\ntheir time to host or participate in an event. Likewise, we gratefully\naccept donations from companies and individuals connected with the gun\nindustry.\n\nAs indicated above, we know that hunting and\nshooting sporting events can be very therapeutic for many of the Wounded\nWarriors we serve, and we're happy to work with the community to make\nthese types of events available to our Alumni. Hunting and shooting\nsport enthusiasts are an incredibly supportive and generous community,\nand we've been honored by how often folks have opened their land and\nhomes, and volunteered their time to make these types of events possible\nfor our Alumni. We're so sorry if it seemed that we didn't appreciate\nthat support with our confusing communication of a business decision. It\ncertainly wasn't our intention!\n\nI hope this post provides\nsome clarity and helps answer some questions. We welcome the\nopportunity to have a warrior on Gun Talk Radio to discuss how hunting\nor events of the like have supported their recovery. We responded too\nquickly to his request and should have delved a bit deeper.\n\nClarity? Oh yes, it provides me some clarity. Now I'm 100% clear that you people are a bunch of tone-deaf fools. Good luck. The pressure is going to be building, and I plan on helping it build just as much as I can.\n\nI had something whiz across my Facebook page this weekend--someone had heard on Tom Gresham's radio program GunTalk that the Wounded Warrior Project (no link, you'll see why in a bit) had refused to participate in an event where guns were present. I figured that someone had misunderstood, and not seeing the gun portion of the blogosphere blow up I figured that was it.\n\nListening to the podcast of the show this morning, I heard the portion of the show concerning this. Sure enough, the Wounded Warrior Project had turned down an opportunity to appear at a HAVA event because, o-o-oh ick, guns were present.\n\nBeing an advocate for doing my own homework, I decided to do so. I found these two things on the Wounded Warrior web site:\n\nIf you're on Facebook (may work if you're not; I'm not sure), here's Gresham's side of the story. Short version is that he got in touch with PR drone Leslie A. Coleman, asked if this was their actual policy and had it confirmed.\n\nOur position regarding firearms and alcohol is in response to the\nstruggles that many injured service members face with substance abuse\nand suicide and the roles those items often play in those issues.\n\nWTF? This is the same sort of BS that we're fed when the gungrabbers have another try at our rights--blame the item used, not the user.\n\nWhat we have here appears to be yet another organization that believes that Lord of the Rings was a documentary, not a work of fiction. I'm way past tired of that crap.\n\nIt's also an organization that has gotten the last donation they'll be getting from me. I'll find someone else doing similar work--someone who is at least not hostile to my civil rights--to donate to. You folks do what you think is right.\n\nSunday, November 11, 2012\n\nOn the preparedness front, there is a lot of information out there. Some of it is inaccurate, and relying on it could cause you some serious problems.\n\nA fairly well know survival podcast has one particular person that is their \"go to guy\" for all things energy. Most of the time, he has his stuff together, and I've learned a lot from listening to him. But lately, I've heard him say something--twice--that I was pretty sure was wrong, based on things I've heard from folks in the industry in question. So I've done a quick check on the subject, just to confirm what I thought I knew. Here's the background and the results.\n\nThis person advocated natural gas as a big part of your preparedness posture. Not LPG or propane, but natural gas as in you have a gas meter at your house, the furnace and stove are attached to it and so on. He says that in the event of a serious, long-term emergency, the natural gas distribution system almost runs itself and could stay up for months to years. Pressure is supplied naturally from the wells, and if no one is digging, pipelines are very reliable. You could still cook, and if you have a generator hooked up, you could power it with natural gas and have electricity as well. With a big enough generator you could even keep your central heat in the winter and AC in the summer. Beats candles, cutting wood and sweating in the heat, let me tell you!\n\nUm, nazzo fast, Guido. According to the American Gas Association, it doesn't work quite that way. Starting in the production fields, compressors are needed to pressurize the lines. Transmission lines need to be pressurized so that the gas keeps moving. While many of these systems are automated, they are centrally controlled--by people, via electronic control systems. As it gets closer to your home, pressure and flow rates are monitored to ensure that things keep moving (and I assume, nothing blows up), again by people using electronic control systems.\n\nMuch of this infrastructure is powered by the natural gas in the lines themselves, but even automated systems break down. I suppose it's possible for much of the system to function on its own for a while, perhaps even a few months, as long as the electronic control systems work. But telling people that they will have near limitless energy available in a long-term grid-down situation is not accurate information, in my opinion. Heck, I wouldn't trust that systems for weeks--what happens if the power in the monitoring stations goes out?\n\nI do believe that natural gas could be a useful strategy. In the event of an emergency, even a regional one, natural gas will probably keep flowing. Can you imagine how much easier your life would be in something like a hurricane event if you still had large quantities of reliable power? You wouldn't be freezing in the dark in a nor' easter in the Rockaways, that's a fact.\n\nBut if I were worried about a months-to-years type event, I'd be sure to have a propane pig, rejetting kits and other sources of power and heat at hand, just in case.\n\nDouble check, triple check, quadruple and quintuple check not only your supplies, but your information. Because the last place you want to get let down by either is when something has hit the fan and became airborne.\n\n(And yes, I've confirmed this information on how the natural gas distribution system works frommultiplesources. )"
