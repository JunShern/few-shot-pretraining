The media have been major proponents and advocates for ObamaCare since it was a glimmer in the President's eye. But the Obama minions at MoveOn must deflect responsibility for this mess away from the President and congressional Democrats in order to complete his utopian transformation of America from now until his term is over.\n\nMoveOn.org is not happy that ObamaCare has become a \"political nightmare\" so they are blaming their cronies in the \"mainstream media\" (yes, they actually use that term) for failing to present balanced coverage of ObamaCare's successes. [See their latest mass email below.] To combat this grave injustice, they are launching a campaign against the Democrat-Media Complex by flooding newsrooms and the internet with stories of the millions of Americans who have purportedly benefitted from ObamaCare.\n\nWant to support our work? MoveOn Civic Action is entirely funded by our 8 million members-no corporate contributions, no big checks from CEOs. And our tiny staff ensures that small contributions go a long\n\nIf you've benefited from Obamacare, or know someone who has-share your story today:\n\nMoveOn members fought long and hard for health care reform because we knew it would improve the lives of tens of millions of Americans. Democrats have had a hard time thus far explaining just how beneficial the new law is, but we don't plan on letting a PR mishap derail the most significant investment in our country's social safety net in generations.\n\nIf you live in one of the 25 states expanding Medicaid-you may be one of the 400,000 Americans who've already benefited from their new eligibility for free health care\n\nIf you live in one of the 25 states expanding Medicaid-you may be one of the 400,000 Americans who've already benefited from their new eligibility for free health care\n\nIf you received an unexpected rebate from your insurance company-that's because the ACA stops insurers from keeping exorbitant profits instead of paying out significant claims.\n\nIf you received an unexpected rebate from your insurance company-that's because the ACA stops insurers from keeping exorbitant profits instead of paying out significant claims.\n\nIf you're recently out of college and struggling to find employer-based coverage in the sluggish economy-you can now opt to stay on your parents' plan until you're 26 years old.\n\nIf you're recently out of college and struggling to find employer-based coverage in the sluggish economy-you can now opt to stay on your parents' plan until you're 26 years old.\n\nIf you've had a donut hole in your prescription drug coverage-thanks to Obamacare, you may be one of an estimated 4 million seniors with Medicare who will soon be able to cover the full costs of your prescriptions.\n\nIf you've had a donut hole in your prescription drug coverage-thanks to Obamacare, you may be one of an estimated 4 million seniors with Medicare who will soon be able to cover the full costs of your prescriptions.\n\nIf you have a child with a pre-existing condition-as of September 2010, health insurance companies can no longer deny your child coverage because of that condition, and as of next year, this rule will apply to Americans of all ages.\n\nIf you have a child with a pre-existing condition-as of September 2010, health insurance companies can no longer deny your child coverage because of that condition, and as of next year, this rule will apply to Americans of all ages.\n\nHere are just some of the ways you may have benefited already:\n\nThe HealthCare.gov website rollout was just the latest piece in the enactment of the Affordable Care Act-Americans have actually been benefiting from the law since 2010. But that's a fact you wouldn't know if you only listened to mainstream media.\n\nIf we're going to change the narrative, though, we've got to start flooding the Internet and the newsrooms with real-world stories from people whose lives are already better because of the Affordable Care Act. That's the only way the media is every going to pay attention.\n\nThankfully, we know what it'll take to turn this political moment around: We're launching a big campaign calling on the media to start giving balanced coverage-and demanding that Congress stand strong for health care reform, because their constituents depend on it.\n\nBut we can't go back-we won't go back-to the bad ol' days before comprehensive health care reform.\n\nA botched website rollout and the media's refusal to cover the stories of the millions of Americans who have already benefited from Obamacare have left the president weakened, Democrats scared, and Republicans emboldened to keep pushing their radical health-care-defunding agenda.\n\nThe past three weeks have been a political nightmare for the Affordable Care Act.\n\nMoveOn members are committed to getting out the truth about Obamacare's successes, even amid the news' recent slanted coverage. But if we're going to get the mainstream media to pay attention, we need to share the real-world stories of people whose lives are being improved. Can you share your Obamacare success story (or that of a family member) today?\n\nStrange way to get the truth, but then again, whodathunk Obama would turn on one of his greatest assets--the press. What's next? Hollywood? Academia?\n\nLet's hope, in their frenzied struggle to bail out ObamaCare, Obama's team continues to supply the 2014 and 2016 elections with more valuable admissions about Obama's abysmal record. For a machine that has beautifully choreographed -- for 5 years -- the dance of lies needed to protect His Highness from multiple scandals that put all previous administrations to shame, bits of the truth are finally allowed out to advance his signature \"achievement\" and protect it from failure. By exposing the administration's lies, they hope to save the big lie that is ObamaCare.\n\nWhat's really got me jazzed about MoveOn.org's announcement of this campaign against the media, is their admission in the body of the email that the economy is still struggling. In claiming that 26 year olds might have already benefited from ObamaCare, MoveOn stated, \"If you're recently out of college and struggling to find employer-based coverage in the sluggish economy-you can now opt to stay on your parents' plan until you're 26 years old.\" [Emphasis added.] As far as admissions go, it doesn't get any better than this.\n\nMoveOn.org is not happy that ObamaCare has become a \"political nightmare\" so they are blaming their cronies in the \"mainstream media\" (yes, they actually use that term) for failing to present balanced coverage of ObamaCare's successes.
