    "text": "Hey everyone! It has been a while since I put something out, but I thought that as it\u2019s almost time for 2015, I should dish out my awards for 2014! Thank you for all the great responses to the 2013 awards, hopefully you\u2019ll enjoy this year\u2019s selection too! So, without further ado, here are this year\u2019s winners\u2026\n\n***Disclaimer: music is subjective, these are just my opinions. When looking at who I\u2019ve given the awards to, please remember that success in the music industry is hard to define as it comes in lots of different shapes and sizes e.g. going from unknown to 10,000 fans, or becoming a regular on UKF etc.***\n\nLet\u2019s kick things off with the more serious awards:\n\nBest Producer- Haywyre. Now, I was tempted to give this to Koven, but I felt that Haywyre\u2019s contribution to 2014 needed to be recognised. He has really delivered, and I\u2019m sure anyone who has heard the Two Fold EP or seen his cover of Smooth Criminal will agree. Not only has he proven he can produce to the highest quality expected, but he has shown his talent across the electronic spectrum with tracks like \u2018Everchanging\u2019 and \u2018The Schism\u2019. I can\u2019t wait to see what he does in 2015!\n\nBest Track- Koven \u2013 Final Call. There were a lot of worthy contenders for this, and it seemed like I\u2019d have to give this to ZHU for his track Faded, however I know that I\u2019d personally rather see this track receive some more recognition instead. It really is something special and it certainly delivers something that not a lot of songs can- major goosebumps.\n\nBest Newcomer- Rootkit. Whilst he may not strictly be a \u201cnewcomer\u201d, it feels like he is, seeing as he has come out of nowhere to \u201cRKO\u201d the music scene by delivering quality track after quality track this year. Showing his versatility with hits like \u2018Too Late\u2019 and \u2018Real Love\u2019, Rootkit certainly deserves recognition for an outstanding year of releases.\n\nBest EP/LP- This was a tough call for sure, but Culprate\u2019s \u2018Deliverance\u2019 is truly a masterpiece and deserves the recognition. It would be remiss of me not to also acknowledge some of the other amazing contributions we\u2019ve had this year such as: Porter Robinson \u2013 Worlds (obviously), Moody Good \u2013 Moody Good, Eptic \u2013 The End, Koven \u2013 Hereinafter Pt I & II, Knife Party \u2013 Abandon Ship (and fuck everyone who hated on it because it seemed like the cool thing to do), Dillon Francis \u2013 Money Sucks: Friends Rule, Haywyre \u2013 Two Fold Pt. 1 and of course, Skrillex \u2013 Recess. (Yes there are others I could mention but I want to keep this relatively short and sweet!)\n\nWorst Track- Tiga \u2013 Bugatti. I mean, are you kidding me? If you take off your hipster beanie for 2 minutes and actually listen to the song\u2026 there is simply nothing positive to say about this track. The fact it got the mainstream exposure it did is, in my opinion, damaging to the electronic music community- it\u2019s like sending Justin Bieber to an interplanetary conference to represent humanity.\n\nBest Remix- ZHU \u2013 Faded (ODESZA Remix). Another very tough call, but this track made such a huge impression on me the first time I heard it, and still sounds amazing even after listening to it countless times. This track shone brightest out of the horde of Faded Remixes and rightly so.\n\nBest Label- Inspected/OWSLA. I genuinely couldn\u2019t decide between these 2. Inspected has released quality track after quality track in 2014 (particular shoutout to their Movember release: \u2018Mosaic\u2019), however OWSLA have been responsible for releasing some of the best tracks of 2014. Therefore they earned the right to share the honours here. Honourable mention to Monstercat for really stepping up the releases this year too.\n\nBest DJ- Porter Robinson. He performed his heart out on his Worlds tour and I\u2019m sure anyone who attended his shows will agree that he earned this.\n\nWorst BJ- Paris Hilton. Typo deliberate.\n\nBest YouTube Promo Channel- MrSuicideSheep. He has had a very strong 2014 and has often gone slightly out of his comfort zone to deliver top quality tracks that you wouldn\u2019t usually expect to hear on there such as Zeds Dead \u2013 Collapse. That, combined with the fact he seems to have taken on-board my criticism from a previous post makes him a winner in 2014.\n\nBest Vocalist- Mammals. They absolutely slayed me with their performance on LVTHER\u2019s track \u2018One Look\u2019 and have a truly unique sound that is a breath of fresh air on the \u201cEDM\u201d world. Honourable mention to Danyka Nadeau who has also had a killer 2014.\n\nBest Blog- Whichever one managed to post about Deadmau5 the least.\n\nMost Underrated Track- Apashe \u2013 No Twerk Ft. Panther x Odalisk. This track is absolute FIRE, yet it largely went unnoticed on release. Some viral videos have since helped raise its popularity, however I still feel this absolute monster of a track passed a lot of people by. Go listen now if you haven\u2019t yet!\n\nMost Underrated Artist- DISKORD. These guys have released a string of MAD tracks in 2014 and I definitely expected them to get more of a following as a result. Tracks like \u2018Go Hard\u2019 and \u2018Freak\u2019 prove they are capable of delivering blistering tracks and I expect them to continue doing so next year.\n\nSmashed It 2014 Award- Mefjus. He has raised both the bar and eyebrows alike by releasing consistently ridiculous tracks. If there\u2019s one man I want to see live as soon as possible, it\u2019s Mefjus.\n\nMost Likely To Smash 2015- Aiden Jude.\n\n\u2026 Just kidding, but seriously, did he die? I haven\u2019t seen any attention-seeking blogs mention him at all lately. Back to the awards though, the Most Likely To Smash 2015 Award ACTUALLY goes to\u2026.. Tchami. Those of you with your \u201cear on the pulse\u201d will have heard his \u2018Take U There\u2019 remix that he released recently and you will know what a monster this guy is. It caps off a year in which he has been truly dominant- from destroying festival stages to co-producing and co-writing one of the biggest tracks of the year- \u2018Turn Down For What\u2019. This guy is destined to do big things in 2015.\n\nAnd now for some more dubious honours\u2026\n\nMost Likely To Not Make It To The End of Year Awards 2015- Anyone who uploads a video of an early WIP of their track and tags everyone on their friends list in it. STAHP.\n\nSexiest Male- Direct. He has defended his title for another year with those tantalising curly locks of hair that whisper sweet nothings to me.\n\nSexiest Female- Danyka Nadeau. I would let her husband the shit out of me.\n\nBest Hair- Andy C. He must be hiding something under that cap. I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s his majestic hair.\n\nCulture Code Consistency Award For Releasing Songs That All Sound The Same- I guess this has to go to Kygo, although to be fair, he has released some great tracks in my opinion.\n\nThe \u201cJared Has AIDS\u201d Award For Impressive Weight Loss- Sadhu. Well done mate.\n\nThe Most Social Media Rants Award (Sponsored by Deadmau5)- Clark Robinson (Twine). For someone who has had such a successful year, you sure have found a lot to complain about along the way. Sending tampons for 2015 brah. Yes, it\u2019s hypocritical of me to award this, but fuck it- I\u2019ve actually barely posted all year! Honourable mention to Curtis \u201cAngriest Man In The World\u201d Dashper.\n\nBest troll- The guy who dressed up as Steve Aoki for Stereosonic Festival and convinced people he was Aoki, despite not actually looking anything like Steve Aoki.\n\nThe \u201cMaking Professor Quirrell Faint In The Hogwarts Great Hall Since Before You Were Born\u201d Award For Lifetime Achievement in Trolling- Wunderground. There have been some exceptionally hilarious satirical articles from Wunderground this year and they thoroughly deserve this award.\n\nThe \u201cThese Are Not The Droids You\u2019re Looking For Award\u201d For Shamelessly Using Bots Without Realising How Obvious It Is To Everyone Else- Sergal Soundwaves (for \u201cbotting\u201d in the best EDM label poll on EDM Sauce- don\u2019t get me started on that poll though\u2026)\n\nThe \u201cSheer Brilliance & Unique Production\u201d Award- all the sheeproducers who made \u201cThis Much Power\u201d/Terror Squad rip-offs this year.\n\nThe \u201cWait, They Make Music?!\u201d Award- Stanton Warriors, whose Facebook page would have you believe they are in fact a meme agency.\n\nMost Baguettes Consumed/Abused- Jack Haigh.\n\nMost Homoerotic Band Name- Jack \u00dc\n\nThe Derek Zoolander Award For Kids Who Can\u2019t Read Good- Anyone who has ever said \u2018EDM Music\u2019.\n\nThe \u201cElectronic Drama Machine\u201d Award For, well it\u2019s pretty self-explanatory- Krewella (and can everyone please chill the fuck out about this and just leave them to sort it out now please?)\n\nThe \u201cTreat Them Mean Keep Them Keen\u201d Award For Releasing Virtually Nothing All Year- Tristam & Nero. Granted, \u2018Satisfy\u2019 was an absolute BANGER, and \u2018My Friend\u2019 is awesome, but I definitely wanted to hear more from these 2 this year.\n\nThat concludes the awards for 2014. Congratulations to everyone who won an award! If you want to have your say on who should have won, let me know in the comments or on my page.\n\nI hope you\u2019ve all bought a greenhouse ready for the inevitable \u201cTropical House\u201d takeover in 2015. Seriously though, I can\u2019t wait to hear what 2015 brings, and big thanks to all the artists who made 2014 another landmark year for electronic music.\n\nStay awesome.\n\nThe Phantom"
