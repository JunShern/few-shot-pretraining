Please I'm confused here\n\nA:\n\nSentence segmentation & tokenization are NLP subtasks, and each NLP library may have different implementations, leading to different error profiles.\nEven within the spaCy library there are different approaches: the best results are obtained by using the dependency parser, but a more simple rule-based sentencizer component also exists which is faster, but usually makes more mistakes (docs here).\nBecause no implementation will be 100% perfect, you will get discrepancies between different methods & different libraries.
