But it's unclear whether the terror group in Iraq and Syria actually had contact with Simpson or Soofi, who both lived in Phoenix.\n\nJUST WATCHED Gunmen opened fire at Mohammed cartoon event Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Gunmen opened fire at Mohammed cartoon event 02:07\n\nMoments before the shootout, Simpson posted an ominous tweet with the hashtag #texasattack: \"May Allah accept us as mujahideen.\"\n\nThe tweet also said Simpson and his fellow attacker had pledged allegiance to \"Amirul Mu'mineen,\" which means \"the leader of the faithful.\" CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank said that probably refers to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi.\n\nEarlier, Simpson had asked his readers on Twitter to follow an ISIS propagandist.\n\nAfter the shooting, the same propagandist tweeted: \"Allahu Akbar!!!! 2 of our brothers just opened fire.\"\n\nBoth Twitter accounts have been deactivated.\n\nHe has a rap sheet\n\nIn 2011, Simpson was convicted of making a false statement involving international and domestic terrorism.\n\nProsecutors said he told FBI agents that he had not discussed traveling to Somalia to engage in \"violent jihad\" -- when, in fact, he had, according to an indictment.\n\nSimpson was sentenced to three years of probation, court records show.\n\nHis former lawyer, Kristina Sitton, told CNN that Simpson ended up on the federal no-fly list. In fact, he contacted her once after trying to get on a plane at a Phoenix airport, only to be turned away.\n\nHe was a 'very devout Muslim'\n\nThat's according to Sitton, who spent many hours over about two years in her office with Simpson while representing him in the Somalia case.\n\nWhen the meetings ran long, the attorney recalled Simpson asking to leave to pray somewhere quiet.\n\n\"He was a very devout Muslim,\" said Sitton, who sensed Simpson was trying to convert her and her staffers but never saw him as a threat. \"... I can tell you with absolute certainty that I didn't observe anything that had anything to do with radicalization.\"\n\nIn fact, Sitton said, \"there were no signs\" that Simpson would pull off an attack like the one in Garland.\n\n\"He was a very kind-hearted, respectful young man,\" the lawyer added. \"He always treated me with respect.\"\n\nHe had 'a good demeanor'\n\nThat view was seconded by the president of the Islamic Community Center of Phoenix, where both Simpson and Soofi worshiped.\n\nUsama Shami said Simpson came regularly until around 2010 or 2011, about the time the FBI arrested him on the false statement charges. Soofi came less frequently.\n\nSimpson \"was a gentle person,\" Shami said. \"He always had a good attitude, a good demeanor.\"\n\nLike others at the mosque, Shami said he was stunned to hear about the attack Sunday night.\n\n\"They didn't show any signs of radicalization or any signs of even thinking about those things in that manner,\" he said. \"So when that happens, it just shocks you. 'How good did you know these people?' That's the question that people ask themselves.\"\n\nHis family is stunned, too\n\nOn top of their grief, Simpson's relatives are struggling to come to terms with his involvement in the attack.\n\n\"We send our prayers to everyone affected by this act of senseless violence, especially the security guard who was injured in the line of duty,\" Simpson's family said in a statement.\n\n\"We are sure many people in this country are curious to know if we had any idea of Elton's plans. To that we say, without question, we did not. Just like everyone in our beautiful country, we are struggling to understand how this could happen. ... We are heartbroken and in a state of deep shock as we grieve.\"\n\nHe and Soofi were roommates\n\nTheir neighbors in Phoenix said they had no clue about what Simpson and Soofi were plotting to do.\n\nAriel Whitlock was actually about to buy a car from Simpson. She was horrified to see the same black Chevrolet Cobalt, damaged from the attack, on the news.\n\nJUST WATCHED Were Texas shooters self-radicalized? Replay More Videos ...

I'm like, 'I was going to purchase that car.' \"\n\nWhitlock said she's sickened by the possibility that, had she bought the car, the money could have gone to fund an attack.\n\n\"Maybe he's just gonna go plot something and you're giving the money to help him go plot something,\" she said. \"It's just crazy.\"\n\nNADIR SOOFI\n\nHe died near where he was born\n\nSoofi was born in Garland and spent the first three years of his life there, his mother said, according to The Dallas Morning News\n\nJUST WATCHED Traffic officer praised for thwarting Texas attack Replay More Videos ...

Just aware of what's going on. I don't know if something snapped or if Elton Simpson was just working on him.\"\n\nHe left behind an 8-year-old son\n\nSharon Soofi also said her son had an 8-year-old boy whom he adored.\n\n\"He put his son above everything,\" she said . \"The hard thing to comprehend is why he would do this and leave an 8-year-old son behind.\"\n\nHe went to a prestigious private school\n\nSoofi's father is Pakistani, and his mother is American, a source with knowledge of the family told CNN.\n\nAfter his parents divorced, Soofi and his brother moved to the United States in 1998 to live with their mother and gradually lost touch with many of their friends in Pakistan , the source said.\n\nIn the 1990s, Soofi attended a prestigious private school in Islamabad.\n\nHe wasn't on the FBI's radar\n\nUnlike Simpson, who had been convicted of a terror-related charge, Soofi was relatively unknown to federal investigators, a law enforcement official told CNN.\n\nAuthorities knew of no indication the two planned to launch Sunday's attack, another law enforcement official said.\n\nHe had asked for forgiveness\n\nSoofi's Facebook page reveals strong opinions, but no call to violence.\n\nBut a note from four years ago shows he asked Allah for forgiveness for every sin -- both intentional and unintentional.\n\nHe was a helpful neighbor\n\nTim Rains remembers Soofi helping him when he had a heart condition about a year ago.\n\nJUST WATCHED Cartoon contest organizer defends decision to hold event Replay More Videos ...

Soofi noticed.\n\n\"He seen all that, and he came over and offered me help,\" Rains said.\n\nSo how does he reconcile the notion that his neighbor also tried to shoot people in Texas?\n\n\"Oh, it's easy, everybody has a good side to them,\" Rains said. \"If you see somebody hurting like that, you're going to help them. I think he went to Texas to shoot people for a reason.\""
