    "text": "Hello, my name\u2019s John Curnow, I am in Immunologist,\nI have a research\ngroup here at the University of Birmingham\nand I\u2019m the programme director\nfor the new MSc in Immunology and Immunotherapy.\nThe programme is delivered as a mixture of\nboth lectures and small group\ntutorials of 10 to 15 students.\nThere\u2019s also a substantial research project\ncarried out in one of the laboratories across\nthe campus.\nImmunology\nimpacts on every area of medicine and we have\nan enormous potential to\ncontrol the immune response.\nExamples include vaccination for infectious\ndisease but also vaccination for cancer.\nSo why study immunology at Birmingham?\nBecause you will be taught by\nscientists at the cutting edge of their discipline.\nThese scientists study both\nthe fundamentals of the immune system, but\nalso there are clinical scientists\nwho are carrying out clinical trials in the\nuse of immunotherapy to treat\ndisease.\nTo complement the expertise of the teaching\nstaff we have a\nfantastic range of cutting edge research laboratories\nand equipment available\nto the students, especially when they carry\nout their research projects.\nEvery\nstudent on the programme will carry out a\nresearch project of around four\nmonths and they will carry these out in these\ninternationally renowned\nresearch groups being fully integrated into\nthose research environments.\nSo when you\u2019ve completed your MSc programme,\nwhat will this enable you to\ndo?\nWell many of our students will go on and study\nat PhD, either staying at\nthe University of Birmingham or going elsewhere\nin the UK or the rest of the\nworld.\nIn addition, however, there is of course a\nvery large job market in this\nmulti-billion dollar industry in the pharmaceutical\nand biotechnology world.\nAlongside that, some people may decide that\nthey want to move slightly\nsideways and may go into scientific media\nor publishing.\nWe welcome applications from anyone with any\nbiological science or\nbiomedical science degree.\nIf you require any further information, please\nfeel\nfree to contact me by email and I hope to\nsee you in September.\n"
