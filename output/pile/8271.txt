When the chamber will take action, or if it will be able to meet the deadline, remains unclear.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellGraham: GOP will confirm Trump's Supreme Court nominee before the election Trump puts Supreme Court fight at center of Ohio rally The Memo: Dems face balancing act on SCOTUS fight MORE (R-Ky.) filed cloture on the House-passed bill early Thursday evening.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut under the Senate\u2019s rules, the earliest the Senate could hold an initial vote is early Saturday morning. After that, senators could drag out the debate for up to an additional 30 hours \u2014 potentially pushing final passage of the bill until roughly 8 a.m. on Sunday.\n\n\u201cAny senator can decide to string out the process,\u201d said Sen. John Cornyn John CornynTumultuous court battle upends fight for Senate Texas Democrats roll out first wave of planned digital ads as Election Day nears Calls grow for Biden to expand election map in final sprint MORE (R-Texas), explaining the chamber\u2019s dilemma. He added it could be a \u201clong couple of days.\u201d\n\nWhen reporters pressed him on the schedule, he quipped: \u201cY'all seem very anxious. You don\u2019t want to spend your weekend with us?\u201d\n\nBeyond filing cloture, McConnell offered no hints about the path forward, or when the Senate will be able to break the current stalemate that has thrown the government into limbo.\n\nThe Senate\u2019s schedule largely comes down to one senator: GOP Sen. Rand Paul Randal (Rand) Howard PaulSecond GOP senator to quarantine after exposure to coronavirus GOP senator to quarantine after coronavirus exposure The Hill's Morning Report - Sponsored by National Industries for the Blind - Trump seeks to flip 'Rage' narrative; Dems block COVID-19 bill MORE (Ky.).\n\nThere is no doubt the bill will pass the Senate. It easily was approved by the House and has support on both sides of the aisle.\n\nBut Paul can slow its progress, and while he has been mum on his plans, he\u2019s signaled he may draw things out.\n\n\u201cPage 281 of \u2018crumni-bus\u2019.

Clapper is the former director of national intelligence, while Brennan is the former CIA chief.\n\nShortly after 6 p.m., Sergio Gor, a spokesman for Paul, sent out an email blast to reporters urging them to check out Paul's Twitter feed.\n\n\u201cMany of you have asked for updates. While everything remains in flux, I did want to share with you our twitter. We are posting some egregious examples of government spending. Worth a click!\u201d he said.\n\nSenators and reporters alike were keeping a close watch on Paul on Thursday as they tried to parse whether or not he would force a repeat performance of his hours-long shutdown from February.\n\nThe libertarian-minded GOP senator antagonized his colleagues by keeping the chamber in session until nearly 2 a.m.\n\nSen. Roy Blunt Roy Dean BluntThis week: Supreme Court fight over Ginsburg's seat upends Congress's agenda McConnell locks down key GOP votes in Supreme Court fight Murkowski: Supreme Court nominee should not be taken up before election MORE (R-Mo.) acknowledged he didn\u2019t know if Paul would cooperate, but \u201chopefully he had time to make the point he wanted to make three weeks ago.\"\n\nRepublicans say Paul did not hint at his plans during a closed-door caucus lunch, which was largely a celebration for retiring GOP Sen. Thad Cochran William (Thad) Thad CochranEspy wins Mississippi Senate Democratic primary Bottom Line Mike Espy announces Mississippi Senate bid MORE (R-Miss.), who is set to retire after four decades next week.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of people who are going to put pressure on him,\u201d said Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.).\n\nAsked if there was an effort to \u201cprevail\u201d on Paul, he added: \u201cThere always is. I'm not being cute. I think there always is an effort.\u201d\n\nFor a brief moment Thursday it appeared Paul could have a partner in crime in his stalling tactics: GOP Sen. John Kennedy John Neely KennedyMORE (La.). told reporters that he hasn't made a decision about if he would slow walk the bill, adding that the legislative process \u201csucks.\u201d\n\nBut he had backed down by Thursday afternoon, saying he would oppose the bill but let it pass quickly.\n\n\u201cI'm not going to try to delay it out of respect for my colleagues,\u201d he said.\n\nThe colossal funding package, which funds the government through the end of September, includes $695 billion in defense funding and $591 billion in nondefense funding.\n\nConservative lawmakers fumed over the higher spending levels, as well as a litany of unrelated issues stuck into the funding bill that is expected to be one of the last major pieces of legislation Congress passes before the midterm election.\n\n\u201cI could not be more discouraged about where we are today with our adult leadership here in Congress and at the White House. This is one of the most grotesque pieces of legislation I can remember,\u201d said GOP Sen. Bob Corker Robert (Bob) Phillips CorkerHas Congress captured Russia policy? Tennessee primary battle turns nasty for Republicans Cheney clashes with Trump MORE (Tenn.).\n\nOther lawmakers grumbled about the breakneck pace of the 2,000-plus page omnibus, which cleared the House less than 24 hours after it was released.\n\nPerdue, who is part of a committee aimed at reforming the appropriations process, added: \u201cYou all I know how I feel about the process. \u2026 [This] is just not the way to govern at all.\u201d\n\nBut with a Christmas tree of legislative priorities included in the bill, leadership in both parties took a victory lap to tout wins for their side of the aisle.\n\nMcConnell pointed to the increase in defense funding, calling it a \u201ctop priority\u201d for Republicans.\n\n\u201cFirst and foremost, in my view, this bill will mark the end of disproportionate and harmful cuts to Department of Defense funding. It delivers the largest year-on-year increase in defense spending in 15 years,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer Chuck SchumerJacobin editor: Primarying Schumer would force him to fight Trump's SCOTUS nominee CNN's Toobin: Democrats are 'wimps' who won't 'have the guts' to add Supreme Court seats Republican senator says plans to confirm justice before election 'completely consistent with the precedent' MORE (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiTrump puts Supreme Court fight at center of Ohio rally CDC causes new storm by pulling coronavirus guidance Overnight Health Care: CDC pulls revised guidance on coronavirus | Government watchdog finds supply shortages are harming US response | As virus pummels US, Europe sees its own spike MORE (D-Calif.) held a joint press conference on Thursday to tout provisions their party secured in the legislation.\n\n\u201cIt was weeks of pain-staking negotiations,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cWe Democrats are really happy with what we were able to accomplish on a number of priorities.\u201d\n\nHe added that \u201cthis spending agreement brings the era of austerity to an unceremonious end.\u201d"
