The way these cannabis-derived compounds interact with our organism is astonishing.\n\nThe endocannabinoid system consists of cellular receptors found in very large amounts throughout the body, and the endocannabinoids\u2014the body\u2019s internal chemical compounds that entice these endocannabinoid receptors.\n\nBecause this is such a complicated topic, wrapping one\u2019s head around everything requires some patience and dedication. However, fathoming the endocannabinoid system is really rewarding and extremely beneficial to anyone looking to consume cannabis for healing purposes.\n\nIt should be taken into consideration that the science of cannabis still has a long way to go, and because of this there are some blanks waiting to be filled. The almost century-long, worldwide illegality of this plant should be held, in large part, accountable for the limited body of research today, and the reasons that led to banning cannabis are also quite sketchy and play a role.\n\nNonetheless, the available collection of scientific works confirms that consuming cannabis-derived cannabinoids compels the body to produce more endocannabinoid receptors, but also to create additional quantities of internal endocannabinoids.\n\nBoth endocannabinoids from the body, and the cannabinoids from the cannabis plant activate cell receptors that cause that individual cell to react in a certain way, and this reaction is dependent not only on the type of cell activated through these receptors, but also on the condition the body is struggling with at the time.\n\nThis may sound like science fiction, but exploring the science behind the endocannabinoids system will help make all this much more understandable. Let\u2019s start with checking out the most notable aspects of the topic.\n\nWhat exactly is the endocannabinoid system, its purpose and when was it discovered?\n\nWhat are the main types of cellular receptors within the endocannabinoid system?\n\nWhat are the main types of endocannabinoids and how they influence the endocannabinoid system?\n\nWhat is endocannabinoid system deficiency?\n\nRole of the endocannabinoid system\n\nFirst, the endocannabinoid system, also known as the ECS, is a vast \u201cnetwork\u201d comprised out of the following:\n\nCellular cannabinoid receptors : These receptors are located on the membranes of many different cells found throughout the body.\n\n: These receptors are located on the membranes of many different cells found throughout the body. Endocannabinoids: These active signaling molecules produced by the body are structurally very similar to active compounds found in cannabis. These internal cannabinoids\u2014just like the ones from cannabis\u2014activate the cannabinoid receptors, and by doing this, trigger a specific response from a cell.\n\nThese active signaling molecules produced by the body are structurally very similar to active compounds found in cannabis. These internal cannabinoids\u2014just like the ones from cannabis\u2014activate the cannabinoid receptors, and by doing this, trigger a specific response from a cell. Enzymes: Different enzymes are responsible for the creation (synthesis), and later the degradation of these compounds.\n\nWhat\u2019s truly amazing about the endocannabinoid system is that the cells that express these specialized endocannabinoid receptors are located in all of the most important parts of our body, including the following:\n\nthe central nervous system (brain, spinal cord);\n\nall vital organs;\n\nThe reproductive organs\n\nvarious glands;\n\nthe immune system;\n\nthe gastrointestinal tract; and\n\nconnective tissues.\n\nSo, the body has this extremely widespread network of cell receptors that react to endocannabinoids and cannabinoids, but what is the function of this system?\n\nThe sole purpose of the ECS is to maintain balance within an organism. This is achieved by performing different tasks within an individual cell, because depending on what type of cell it is\u2014nerve cells, immune cells, skin cells, muscle cells, secretory cells and so forth\u2014the precise mechanism of action of that specific cell will be different.\n\nThe way a specific cell reacts when a endocannabinoid (or a cannabinoid) activates its receptor is also dependent on the type of condition with which an organism is afflicted. This means the ECS is very adaptive and can trigger an extremely wide range of biological responses inside of a single cell, depending on what exactly is wrong at that given time.\n\nIn an ideal situation, where all the systems of the body\u2014including the circulatory, digestive, endocrine, integumentary/exocrine, lymphatic/immune, muscular, nervous, urinary/excretory, reproductive, respiratory and skeletal\u2014function optimally, this perfect functioning of an organism is called the homeostasis, which can be also understood as a dynamic state of equilibrium. The endocannabinoid system is a primary \u201cinstrument\u201d in charge of maintaining homeostasis, and this is why the cells of all these different systems and tissues have (endo)cannabinoid receptors.\n\nIn a nutshell, the endocannabinoid system oversees maintaining health on a cellular level in every system of the body, vigilantly reacting and adapting to the continuous changes that the body encounters.\n\nUnfortunately, the ECS does not function properly in everyone, and this malfunction is associated with the body\u2019s inability to heal itself optimally. Even though the precise causes of ECS malfunction remain elusive, it is hypothesized that numerous different factors\u2014including genetics, diet, lack of exercise, various pollutants and stress\u2014are all responsible for an insufficiently effective endocannabinoid system.\n\nAn inactive ECS can also be responsible for \u201chelping\u201d some conditions and diseases to occur, which the article will later address.\n\nEndocannabinoid system discovery\n\nUncovering how the cannabinoids from cannabis, and the internal endocannabinoids, stimulate the cellular receptors across the body was not a simple task.\n\nOver the course of history, numerous cultures have been using cannabis for medicinal reasons. During the 19th century, cannabis-derived products were also used for health-related purposes across Europe and the U.S. because of the pioneer work of Williams O\u2019Shaughnessy, a doctor from Ireland, and French scientist Jacques-Joseph Moreau.\n\nAs the science of chemistry wasn\u2019t fully developed, they only understood that cannabis brings relief for numerous conditions, without comprehending how the healing actually occurs.\n\nConsider the brief, but precise, timeline of scientific discoveries in the field of cannabis:\n\n1895: the first cannabis-based compound named cannabinol (CBN) was isolated;\n\n1930: the precise chemical structure of cannabinol (CBN) was mapped;\n\n1940: the second cannabis-based compound cannabidiol (CBD) was isolated;\n\n1963: the precise chemical structure of cannabidiol (CBD) was mapped;\n\n1964: the psychoactive tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) was isolated;\n\n1988: the cannabinoid receptors were first located;\n\n1990: a cannabinoid receptor was first cloned; and\n\n1993: internal endocannabinoids anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) were first identified.\n\nAs can be seen, discoveries over the last three decades include the identification of both the cannabinoid receptors and the endocannabinoids, discoveries that are absolutely crucial for understanding how the endocannabinoid system functions, and how the cannabinoids from the cannabis plant affect and influence this system.\n\nThrough all these years, numerous scientists gave their contributions to help reveal the secrets of cannabis and the ECS, but the person who improved the science behind cannabis the most is Dr. Raphael Mechoulam, a famed Israeli organic chemist and a professor of medicinal chemistry in Jerusalem. Mechoulam was involved in mapping the structure of CBD in 1963, and one year later, he and his team identified and isolated THC. During the 1990s, he also participated in the discovery of the body\u2019s own endocannabinoids anandamide and 2-AG.\n\nLearn more about his magnificent work in our article on THC.\n\nThe ECS was discovered by accident, so to speak. In the 1980s, researchers were trying to uncover how cannabis, more precisely THC, induces the psychoactive high, and found that certain cells in the body have specific cellular receptors, in which THC fit perfectly.\n\nResearchers theorized the body must produce its own endogenous compounds that are structurally similar to THC, and after several years of research, more precisely in 1993, anandamide and 2-AG were identified.\n\nBy discovering the endocannabinoid receptors and internal endocannabinoids, scientists have confirmed the existence of a previously unknown physiological system. It is now known that the ECS has an incredibly beneficial influence on practically every other system in the body, and functions as a tool for healing, but also for maintaining optimal health.\n\nBelow are a few interesting facts about the ECS in general:\n\nbesides humans, every other vertebrate species (animals with a spine) possess an endocannabinoid system;\n\nthe most primitive animal that expresses an ECS is the sea-squirt (also called tunicate), which evolved around 600 million years ago; and\n\nin humans, a 2009 study shows the endocannabinoid system is fully operational before leaving the mother\u2019s uterus.\n\nReceptors of the endocannabinoid system\n\nThese cellular receptors are responsible for the body\u2019s reaction to endocannabinoids, but also the cannabinoids from cannabis. There are two main, distinct types of cannabinoid receptors, and they can be considered \u201clocks\u201d present on the membranes of different types of cells in the body. The endocannabinoid and cannabinoid compounds, for their parts, act as \u201ckeys\u201d that trigger a specific response from these cells, upon entering the \u201clock\u201d of the receptors.\n\nCB1 Receptor\n\nCB1s are the most abundant cannabinoid receptors in the body and are mostly located in the central nervous system (CNS), more precisely the brain and the spinal cord. In the brain, the largest quantity of the CB1 receptors is present in the following:\n\nfrontal cortex: where thinking happens;\n\nhippocampus: in charge of memory;\n\ncerebellum: in charge of movement; and\n\nbasal ganglia: associated with voluntary movement, learning, cognition and emotion.\n\nOther than the central nervous system, CB1 receptors are found in the vital and reproductive organs, various glands, gastrointestinal and urinary tract, white blood cells and connective tissues.\n\nCB2 Receptor\n\nCB2 is the second most prominent cannabinoid receptor, and unlike CB1, it is mostly found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, where most of the body\u2019s immune system is located. Large concentrations of CB2 receptors are also found in the tonsils and the thymus gland, and both sections of the body are also valuable assets of the immune response. Like CB1, CB2 receptors are expressed in some neuron cells, like the microglia, in the brain and other parts of the central nervous system, but in much smaller quantities.\n\nAnother captivating attribute of the ECS is that both the cannabinoid receptors and the internal endocannabinoids get synthesized in the body on demand. This basically means that when the body \u201csenses\u201d that additional receptor/endocannabinoid expression will return the organism into a state of homeostasis, both the receptors and the compounds get synthesized on demand.\n\nStudies, including one published in 2007, have shown that this trait of the ECS occurs in situations like nerve injury, inflammation and tissue damage. Here are a few more facts about ECS receptors:\n\nIt is speculated that CB1 and CB2 receptors are more numerous than any other receptor system in the human body, including the receptors of neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin.\n\nNumerous parts of the body contain both CB1 and CB2 receptors, and they are found on many intersections\u2014the borders of two or more different physiological systems\u2014of the body, contributing to the communication and co-operation of differing types of cells.\n\nBesides CB1 and CB2, certain endocannabinoids activate other receptors in the body, including the transient receptor potential (TRP) and peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPARs).\n\nEndocannabinoids\n\nVery similar to the current understanding of cannabis-derived cannabinoids, contemporary science has currently figured out the precise mechanisms of action of two internal endocannabinoids, anandamide and 2-AG. Even though not everything is understood, the ongoing research has provided great insight about the functioning of the ECS, and the extremely diverse roles of these endogenous compounds.\n\nAnandamide (N-arachidonoylethanolamine, or AEA)\n\nDiscovered in 1993 by Mechoulam, anandamide is the most thoroughly studied endocannabinoid. The name is derived from the sanskrit word \u201cananda\u201d, meaning bliss or delight, which is one of the main cerebral effects of anandamide.\n\nThe role of this compound is profoundly diverse, helping to regulate numerous processes that include immune system function, central nervous system function, appetite, pain, memory and much more. Anandamide is an activator, or agonist, of both CB1 and CB2 endocannabinoid receptors, meaning it is created (synthesized) throughout the tissues of the body, which also explains its divergent effect on the organism.\n\nAs previously mentioned, both endocannabinoids and endocannabinoid receptors get synthesized on demand, meaning the body makes them once it \u201csenses\u201d the need for these compounds.\n\nExercise boosts anandamide levels\n\nThe best example of this phenomena is the \u201crunner\u2019s high\u201d, where long-distance runners experience an intensely visceral euphoric feeling, and this sensation is actually anandamide\u2019s doing. Scientists have observed that prolonged aerobic exercise, for over 30 minutes, increases anandamide levels, complementing the joyous feeling experienced after hard physical labour. Marathon and triathlon competitors, for example, experience increased levels of anandamide in the greatest possible extent as their aerobic exercise is intense and very durable at the same time.\n\nAnandamide affects memory and forgetting\n\nWhat\u2019s also fascinating is the effect that anandamide has on memory. Naturally, one would assume that it increases or enhances memory, but the truth is, this compound has a very important role in forgetting.\n\nThis might seem somewhat unusual at first, but consider how much input humans receive from their senses daily. For instance, the amount of faces seen every time as a person, for example, rides the subway. For the brain to store things worth remembering, unneeded information has to be \u201cdeleted\u201d.\n\nAnandamide\u2019s so-called forgetting function is also very important for traumatic and extremely stressful events, and people suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have a very difficult time disconnecting from the trauma they\u2019ve experienced. This is why CBD works wonders for anxiety and also PTSD patients.\n\nAs noted previously, endocannabinoids are created and degraded by certain enzymes in our body. Cannabidiol (CBD) lessens the production of a specific enzyme that is responsible for degrading, or \u201crecycling\u201d, anandamide. By diminishing the amounts of the FAAH (fatty acid amide hydrolase) enzyme, anandamide is left to engage the receptors of the endocannabinoid system for extended periods of time, leading to a diminishment of general anxiety, but also the stress caused by PTSD.\n\nGenetic mutations increase anandamide levels\n\nThe exact same mechanism of degrading anandamide with FAAH enzyme is also what separates entire happy from unhappy nations, which was noticed by examining their \u201clevels of happiness.\u201d This research provided an insight that specific genetic mutations are responsible for different levels of FAAH enzyme in the body, and lesser quantities of this enzyme directly correlates with a constantly better mood, and a general sense of well-being.\n\nThe science team behind this study also noted that a sense of happiness, of course, isn\u2019t only dependant on this connection, but also depends on a complex mixture of economic and political factors.\n\nFoods that increase anandamide production\n\nSome foods are can actually boost anandamide levels, and some can slow down the metabolization of the FAAH enzyme that degrades it.\n\nDark Chocolate\n\nPure chocolate affects anandamide levels in two ways: First, it increases the number of available endocannabinoid receptors that can be triggered by anandamide and, second, it diminishes levels of FAAH enzyme that destroys it.\n\nBlack Truffles\n\nUnlike chocolate, which influences the ECS in more subtle ways, black truffles contain the anandamide compound, and when eaten, they directly increase the levels of this endocannabinoid in the body.\n\nWhat\u2019s also fascinating about these mushrooms is that they don\u2019t have any endocannabinoid receptors whatsoever, and it is theorized the presence of anandamide acts as a tactic for spreading the spores\u2014their asexual reproductive units\u2014by attracting predators to eat them, and, subsequently, spreading the spores to nearby surfaces.\n\nKaempferol\n\nThis compound is found in many fruits and vegetables, such as apples, grapes, onions, potatoes, tomatoes and broccoli. Besides being a powerful antioxidant and reducing oxidative stress, kaempferol also inhibits the synthetization of FAAH enzyme, thus prolonging the duration and effect of anandamide.\n\nOmega 3 Fatty Acid\n\nConsuming these polyunsaturated fatty acids found in fish oil, krill oil, hemp and flax seeds has been shown to increase the vigilance of the endocannbinoid system.\n\n2-AG (2-Arachidonoylglycerol)\n\nThis is the second most prominent endocannabinoid found in the body, but currently it isn\u2019t nearly as researched as anandamide. What is known so far is that 2-AG is present in much larger quantities in the central nervous system\u2014brain and spinal cord\u2014than anandamide. 2-AG is also an agonist\u2014it triggers a biological response\u2014of both CB1 and CB2 endocannabinoid receptors.\n\nWhat\u2019s also interesting is that 2-AG is a high-efficiency agonist of endocannabinoid receptors, while anandamide is described as a low-efficiency agonist for CB1, and a very low-efficiency agonist of CB2 receptors.\n\nWhat additionally separates anandamide and 2-AG is that the enzymes that synthesize and degrade these endocannabinoids are completely different\u2014anandamide is degraded by FAAH, and 2-AG is degraded by an enzyme called monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL).\n\nAs such, they have completely different roles within the ECS, although both are tools for maintaining balance within an organism, which is the primary function of the endocannabinoid system.\n\nResearchers will, undoubtedly, provide additional knowledge about this enigmatic compound soon.\n\nEndocannabinoid system deficiency\n\nClinical endocannabinoid deficiency, or CECD, is a health condition where the body doesn\u2019t produce adequate quantities of endocannabinoids, or it doesn\u2019t produce the needed amount of endocannabinoid receptors. A possible cause for CECD be that the body produces too many enzymes (FAAH, MAGL), that break down the endocannabinoids before they get the chance to affect the receptors. As a result of this deficiency, a weakened ECS cannot properly maintain homeostasis.\n\nThe condition was first described by Dr. Ethan Russo, who\u2019s been on the forefront of modern cannabis research during the last two decades. Russo\u2019s research shows that clinical ECS deficiency can have a negative influence on many conditions and diseases, including the following:\n\nmigraines;\n\nirritable bowel syndrome (IBS);\n\nfibromyalgia;\n\npost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD);\n\ndepression;\n\nmultiple sclerosis;\n\nParkinson\u2019s disease;\n\nchronic pain;\n\nmuscle spasms; and\n\nmood imbalances and irritability.\n\nAll of this may seem a bit far-fetched to someone who isn\u2019t acquainted with the incredibly diverse role that the ECS plays in the body. But if official scientific research concluded that a malfunctioning endocannabinoid system is connected to so many physiological issues, this directly coincides with why cannabis is a valid and successful treatment method for so many conditions, disorders and diseases, such as the following:\n\n* anxiety ;\n\n* depression ;\n\n* insomnia ;\n\n* PTSD;\n\n* epilepsy ;\n\n* pain ;\n\n* cancer ;\n\n* concussions ;\n\n* fibromyalgia ;\n\n* arthritis ;\n\n* amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) ;\n\n* asthma ;\n\n* diabetes ;\n\n* lupus ;\n\n* autism ;\n\n* glaucoma ;\n\n* Parkinson\u2019s disease; and\n\n* Crohn\u2019s disease .\n\nCombating skepticism through awareness\n\nEven though the number of scientific studies dealing with medical cannabis, endocannabinoid system and cannabinoids from cannabis have already been the subject of over 24.000 different articles, many people are still very skeptical about the healing properties of this plant. Considering the decades-long global illegality of cannabis, this doesn\u2019t really come as a surprise. Taking one\u2019s health into one\u2019s own hands is something I consider a personal responsibility, especially when the medicine in question is something completely natural and has existed on this planet long before humans.\n\nAnother reason that demands self-education about cannabis and health is that very few doctors know anything about the ECS, and the effects of endocannabinoids and cannabinoids.\n\nThis survey from 2013 was conducted by the Medical Cannabis Evaluation. It questioned medical schools in the U.S. if the endocannabinoid system is a part of their curriculum.\n\nThe survey found that only 13 percent of surveyed schools were teaching future doctors about the ECS.\n\nThe hope is that this percentage has increased since 2013, but it\u2019s believed that the increment is miniscule. This implies that the chances of one\u2019s personal doctor knowing anything about the ECS\u2014and how it can be positively influenced by cannabis\u2014are very slim.\n\nWhat\u2019s also very important to understand is that by consuming cannabinoids from cannabis, which are health-beneficial by themselves, people can also increase the quantity of both cannabinoid receptors, and the internal endocannabinoids.\n\nSmall and carefully thought-out doses spur the body to produce more of its endogenous cannabinoids, like anandamide and 2-AG, and at the same time, increase the concentration of cannabinoid receptors CBI and CB2.\n\nThis is very valuable to people whose endocannabinoid system is not functioning properly, but more importantly, it demonstrates that cannabinoids from cannabis aren\u2019t just a simple cure\u2014they are also a tool that helps the body increase production of its own internal health regulators.\n\nA greater number of receptors means that lesser quantities of cannabinoids are needed to produce a desired effect, and a carefully planned intake of cannabinoids also increases the amount of available endocannabinoids.\n\nCheck out the all-inclusive dosage guidebook\u2014for which Greencamp collaborated with Dr. Dustin Sulak, who has extensive experience with treating patients with medical cannabis\u2014to learn more about how to correctly and accurately dose cannabis.\n\nWhat\u2019s also very important to mention when consuming cannabinoid-based derivatives for medicinal purposes is that it is of utmost importance to consume products that aren\u2019t isolated compounds, but, instead, have a full spectrum of cannabinoids in them, just like the real plant.\n\nBesides THC and CBD, each strain of cannabis has a vast number of accompanying compounds that\u2014even if found only in trace amounts\u2014add to the synergistic effect of cannabis as a whole, in what\u2019s dubbed the entourage effect.\n\nSynthetic cannabinoids or isolated THC/CBD medications don\u2019t have any minor cannabinoids or terpenes in them, and because of this they lack the cooperative effect leading to a much weaker therapeutic impact.\n\nThe state of the endocannabinoid system is very important as its purpose is to help regulate the proper functioning of all other physiological system of the body. The cellular receptors of the ECS can be positively influenced by cannabinoids from cannabis, causing incredibly diverse effects that are completely dependent on the medical issue in question, but the end goal is always the same: Homeostasis, a state of equilibrium of an entire organism.\n\nCannabis is such a powerful medicine for an incredibly large number of conditions because it directly influences an ancient and all-encompassing system in the body. Further educating oneself on this complex and fascinating topic can bring nothing but good.\n\nWant to keep up to date on what\u2019s happening in the world of cannabis?
