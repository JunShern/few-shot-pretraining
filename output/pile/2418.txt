    "text": "Market Capitalization of Tokens > $1.2B\n\nWhile it\u2019s interesting to look at Token Sales in terms of in dollars raised, it\u2019s equally important to calculate the value of the tokens after they have been issued.\n\nOf the 56 successful Token Sales in the dataset, 34 tokens have started trading and are listed on Coinmarketcap. The market capitalization (the USD value of available supply of tokens) for these 34 tokens currently stands at $1.16B.\n\nFigure 3: Market Capitalization of \u201cListed\u201d Tokens\n\nThe 33 projects that these tokens represent raised $150M in their respective token sales. A back of the envelope calculation shows a 8x increase in dollar value, and our impulsive reaction might be to rush into every single token sale we can get into.\n\nTokens ARE Risky\n\nThe theoretical case for Token Sales is that it they are the optimal way to launch decentralized business models, ranging from core blockchain protocols to Decentralized Applications (dApps) on top of existing blockchains. Ethereum itself started as a Token Sale raising $18M worth of Bitcoin. In these decentralized business models tokens should be the core value unit that represent some combination of usage, work and/or ownership. As Nick Tomaino explained, we should think of tokens primarily as a product feature and not as a fundraising feature.\n\nThe majority of projects behind the tokens have not yet launched. They\u2019re in various stages, ranging from beta launch to being stuck in endless ideation. Simultaneously, many projects are taking advantage or \u201cexploit\u201d the exponential growth and interest from unsophisticated investors interested in digital currencies. This ranges from projects that have no obvious network effects at all or are outright scams (Google \u201cico scam\u201d for starters).\n\nThis indicates that Token Sales are a very young and very risky market. It will take time and more data to get a sense of how risky tokens are and what factors determine winners and outperformance. Sophisticated investors and VC\u2019s in the cryptocurrency space look at the development teams, network potential and core technology as factors that could mitigate some of the risks. The average investor and many digital currency enthusiast will have very few of these skills. Nonetheless, there is some data that we can use to conduct a straightforward analysis and answer the following question:\n\nHave Token Sales returned more money than Bitcoin and/or Ether?\n\nTokens Do Not Outperform Ethereum\n\nGiven the limited amount of data needed for financial return analysis, I was able to calculate the returns for 28 tokens since their sale and compared them with returns on Bitcoin and Ether during the same timeframe. The 28 tokens and the projects they represent were the only ones on which I could collect data from multiple sources to calculate the price at issuance, price now and market capitalization.\n\nFigure 4: Absolute Returns and Hypothetical Portfolio Returns\n\nIf you were to invest $1 in each of the 28 Token Sales, held onto the tokens and sold them at the time of writing you would have made roughly 9x of the notional investment. This compares with \u201conly\u201d 2x if you had invested $1 in Bitcoin tokens at exactly the same times as the Token Sales. More importantly, a portfolio of Ethereum tokens would have yielded 11x, beating the portfolio of tokens.\n\nBecause of the limited data, outliers skew the results drastically. For example, Augur\u2019s token sale took place in October 2015, when Ether was trading at $0.70. Since then, Augur REP-tokens have increased by 29x vs 134x for Ether. Taking Augur out, the results swing in favor of tokens, as per the figure below. When I remove the 2 largest return outliers for Tokens and Ether (i.e. remove 4 in total) the Ether and Token portfolios return roughly the same amount.\n\nFigure 5: Multiples for various portfolio combinations\n\nIt\u2019s not the goal of this analysis to determine which tokens are the best investments. We can slice and dice the dataset in many ways that tip the returns in favor of either Tokens, Ether or even Bitcoin. We must not forget that many of the Token Sales are an application layer on top of the Ethereum blockchain. By investing in tokens you are essentially exposing yourself to some (undetermined) amount of Ethereum exposure, and taking on additional risk. One could argue that the performance swings in my hypothetical portfolios are merely reflections of this additional risk. Until there is more time series data the jury is still out on whether this is the case.\n\nFigure 6: Market Cap of Tokens vs Market Cap of Ethereum\n\nConclusion\n\nThe conclusion that I am confident to make is that the data shows that most digital currency enthusiasts are better off staying away from Token Sales. Unless you\u2019re planning to actually use the tokens for the services that the underlying projects will offer, tokens as a speculative investment come with great risks.\n\nInvestors who are unable to do a full due diligence (development team, technical specifications, network model) on a new Token Sale are probably better off investing in core cryptocurrencies such as Ether. This will yield better results than rushing into every single Token Sale or even token portfolios. It\u2019s common sense and is backed by some data now.\n\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n\nAppendix\n\nAll data used in the analysis is publicly accessible on the websites or via the public API\u2019s of Coinbase, Coinmarketcap, Smith & Crown, ICOrating & Tokenmarket\n\nMost of the terminology that I\u2019ve used were first coined by the following persons on a variety of websites and podcasts:\n\nChris Dixon & Olaf Carlson-Wee: a16z podcast on tokens and polychain capital\n\nOlaf Carlson-Wee & Ryan Zurrer: Ether review podcast\n\nFred Ehrsam: one, two, three, four\n\nFred Wilson: Decentralized Startup\n\nNaval Ravikant: The Fifth Protocol"
