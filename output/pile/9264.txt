For many are called,\nbut few are chosen.\nNow l'm all the more convinced.\n''The kingdom will be taken from you,''\nHe said, ''and given to another.''\nGiven to the few, who are chosen.\nWere we few not chosen\non the shores of Galilee?\nThe weight of it all.\nThis very temple will be His palace.\nFriends, do you see these walls?\nYes, Master. We know\nwhat you're about to say .\nThe day is coming when they shall fall.\nAnd there shall not be\none stone left upon another .\nlt doesn't make sense. He rises to power ,\nthen the temple is destroyed?\nThat can't be what He meant.\nThere shall not be one\nstone left upon another.\nThose were His words.\nlt must be a parable,\nor a saying that means something else.\nWell, maybe a new temple will be\nbuilt in place of the old one.\nMaybe there will be a battle,\nand we'll have to fight\nthose Romans after all.\nCome, let's ask the Master .\nFriends, be not deceived concerning\nthe coming day of my power.\nWe are not deceived, Lord.\nWe know you've come\nto rule over lsrael.\nOver the whole world.\nAgain, l say unto you, be not deceived,\nFor before that day many shall come\nin my name saying, ''l am Christ.''\nAnd they shall deceive many.\nAnd when ye shall hear of wars,\nand rumors of wars, be not troubled\nfor such things must need be.\nBut the end shall not be yet\nfor nation shall rise against nation,\nand kingdom against kingdom.\nAnd there shall be\nearthquakes in many places.\nAnd there shall be famines and pestilence.\nThese are the beginning of sorrows.\nBut in those days after that tribulation,\nthe sun shall be darkened.\nAnd the moon shall not give her light.\nAnd the stars of heaven shall fall.\nAnd the powers that\nare in the heavens shall be shaken.\nLord, when shall all this be?\nNo man knows that day.\nNot even the Son of Man.\nWatch therefore, for you know not\nwhat hour your Lord will come.\nHear this parable:\nFor the Kingdom of Heaven\nis like a man\npreparing to travel\nto a distant country,\nwho called his servants and\nentrusted his property to them.\nQuick.
