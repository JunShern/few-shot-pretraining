    "text": "THE PEGASUS FILE\n\nVietnam Special Forces Air Combat Controller; 25 year CIA deep cover agent; US Army pilot flying classified missions during the US invasion of Grenada; Iran-Contra pilot flying cocaine shipments labelled as medical supplies; and member of the ultra-secret, international G7 run Pegasus \"Hit Team\" - this is the extraordinary story of Gene \"Chip\" Tatum.\n\nBy David Guyatt\n\nPart 1\n\nFrom sensitive and highly secret - and hitherto largely unknown - Special Forces covert operations in Cambodia, to wandering CIA asset, through to \"black ops\" activities in Grenada and Oliver North's Iran-Contra \"Enterprise,\" and on to membership in an international \"hit team,\" Gene \"Chip\" Tatum has seen it all, done it all and is now telling it all.\n\nTatum knows where the skeletons are buried. Above all he is aware that his testimony implicates serving and former US Presidents, plus a whole list of high government officials, and others, in a welter of nefarious activities - including assassination, blackmail, coercion, gun-running, money-laundering and Cocaine trafficking.\n\nTatum, a lanky Floridian, turned whistle-blower following his arrest on a treason charge in 1995. The charge was both astonishing and patently ludicrous and resulted in a flurry of press interest with an article appearing in the Tampa Tribune on 4 May 1996. Incredibly, the charge was later dropped to be replaced by a fraud charge - a drastic step-down. Found guilty he was sentenced to serve a 15 month sentence. In March 1996, an additional charge - \"conspiring to embezzle\" was brought against him. Found guilty he is now incarcerated in Jessup Federal Correctional Facility, Florida, where he is serving a 27 month concurrent sentence.\n\nMany questions continue to hang over the conduct of the trial. His defence lawyer refused to call any of the 80 witnesses nominated by Tatum for the defence. Later he freely confessed to having come under pressure from the Defence Department. Tatum says the first charge was a set-up to discredit him following his \"resignation\" from Operation Pegasus. The second he views with greater scepticism and concern.\n\nHis resignation from Pegasus followed his refusal to \"neutralise\" a leading US political figure in the 1992 US presidential elections. Tatum declares he will not \"participate in assassinations of any sort, character assassinations or anything, of American citizens.\" He goes on to explain that back in 1994, in a telephone conference call from Oliver North, Felix Rodriguez and the late William Colby of the CIA, he was warned to turn over incriminating documents and tapes he had accumulated for his \"retirement.\" He wryly observes that had he done so, he would probably have been quickly \"terminated\" in an \"extreme\" way - a speciality of the Pegasus team of which he was once a member. Countering this demand, he volunteered to plead guilty on a fabricated felony count and serve a twelve month sentence - so that his credibility was damaged in the event he ever decided to speak out. His incarceration for the second charge - and especially the 6 months sentencing of his wife, Nancy - has led him to speak out about his life which spans almost thirty years as a \"black\" operative. It is an extraordinary story.\n\nOPERATION RED ROCK\n\nTatum's has written of his early career in the military, and his involvement in a highly sensitive and classified operation in an unpublished manuscript entitled \"Operation Red Rock.\" Joining the Air Force in February 1970, he went through Army jump school; escape and evasion; jungle training; sea survival school; diving school and was assigned along with six others as \"Combat Controllers\" - the USAF equivalent of Special Forces - receiving his distinctive Special Forces burgundy coloured beret. From there he was assigned to Tinker AFB, Oklahoma, and then on to Fort Bragg, North Carolina - home of the Green Berets - for training in C4 plastic explosives, mines, nuclear, biological and chemical warfare, plus indoctrination in electronic and psychological operations.\n\nPosted to South East Asia as Airman First Class (A1C) in December 1970, he was assigned as a radio operator on a Forward Air Control (FAC) aircraft attached to Task Force Alpha at Nakhon Phanom, Thailand. In short order he was recruited (an involuntary \"volunteer\") to Team Red Rock. The team was composed of eight US Army Green Berets, three US Navy SEALS and two \"cowboys\" - a euphemism for CIA paramilitary specialists. With Tatum attached, Team Red Rock totalled 14 in all, and was about to be tasked with an operation that came directly from the White House.\n\nIn January 1971 the team received a final briefing from General Alexander Haig - who had flown in specially - along with Central Intelligence Agency, Saigon Chief William Colby; posing as \"Mr. Peepers.\" Haig and Colby outlined the plan, stressing it's importance and extreme classification. President Nixon, desperate to quell domestic riots over an increasingly unpopular war, sought to withdraw all US personnel from Southeast Asia. Withdrawal would - and in the end ultimately did - cause a military vacuum quickly leading to the defeat of South Vietnamese forces.\n\nDuring those years, Nixon was also running a \"secret war\" in Cambodia and Laos. In Laos, dwindling number of Meo tribesmen together with covert US personnel employed by the CIA proprietary company, Air America, were battling against superior North Vietnamese ground forces. A much similar pattern was occurring in Cambodia, amid grave fears that the \"Domino Theory\" would result if either of these two nations were to fall to the communist North Vietnamese. Nixon hoped that the vacuum caused by the withdrawal of US covert forces could be filled by native Cambodian forces. Lon Nol, the Cambodian leader, continued to stubbornly resist Nixon's diplomatic overtures to take up the slack - anxious to hedge his bets and realistic about his chances of survival as Kymer Rouge and Vietnamese forces prepared to swarm-in unhindered by US air power.\n\nA plan had been drawn up at the highest levels of Nixon's administration. Team Red Rock were to secretly enter Cambodia's capital, Phnom Penh, and attack the airport, military and civil installations - wrecking as much havoc as possible. The plan called for the team to parachute into the outskirts of Phnom Penh carrying with them captured NVA \"Sappers.\" Taken in unarmed and alive, the Sappers would be \"sacrificed\" and their bodies left to be discovered by Cambodian forces. A furious, Lon Nol would assume North Vietnam was to blame. Such an act would, it was hoped, stiffen Lon Nol's backbone. With nowhere else to turn, the US puppet would urgently seek US hardware to strengthen his forces and continue the battle.\n\nThe team were not told that they too were to be sacrificed by their President to ensure that word of the operation never reached the light of day. A detachment of Montagnard tribesmen (Yards) in the pay of the CIA were assigned to liquidate each member of the team and dispose of their bodies. The attack went successfully, but the teams suspicion of the \"Yards\" foiled the betrayal. Using their knowledge of \"escape and evasion\" tactics the team decided to trek to the Vietnamese border and back to safety with US forces.\n\nCasualties thinned out their numbers until only eight of them remained. Soon these, too, were captured by NVA regulars and underwent hideous torture at the hands of Chinese and Russian interrogators. Ultimately, only Tatum and one other team member survived the ordeal. Convalescing, Tatum was debriefed by CIA station chief, William Colby, and told he would, in future, be kept close to the \"Agency\". Recruited into the CIA, the yawning door of future \"black\" operations creaked open. Life would never be the same again for Chip Tatum.\n\nCIA DEEP COVER AGENT\n\nFor the next ten years or so, Tatum's covert activities were varied. For awhile he worked out of Homestead Air Force Base where he was NCIOC of the tower receiver sight and MARS station. This was the base which then President Nixon used for his frequent visits to the Key Biscayne, Florida, White House. Much of this period remains obscured behind a thick blanket of classification.\n\nFrom there he was stationed in Northern Italy, tasked with visiting the border towns of Yugoslavia and Italy. Colby felt that as a young Air Force man, Tatum might be \"approached\" in these towns for \"information.\" The idea was to make contact with foreign agents and covertly gather information about them and their operations. Later he was tasked with infiltrating Yugoslavia, searching for missing US POW's from Vietnam and elsewhere in Southeast Asia - as well as being assigned to gather intelligence on potential successors to the then Yugoslavian President, Tito.\n\nBy 1976, he was operating out of Lamar, Colorado, in a communications facility, called OLAB. His contact there was Don Holmes, president of Valley - a Saving & Loan bank. Tatum acted as his courier shuttling between Lamar and Springfield, Colorado with transaction files. From there he was transferred to McDill Air Force Base, Tampa, Florida. Shortly before his McDill posting, he received a call from Colby telling him he was resigning his position as Director, Central Intelligence and recommending Tatum should de-activate his clandestine CIA activities. Colby continued, saying that remaining active without Colby there to protect him, may place him in personal \u0093jeopardy,\u0094 as he had powerful enemies in Washington. This warning referred to Nixon, Kissinger and Haig and Tatum\u0092s role and survival from Operation Red Rock. Tatum took good notice of the warning and became de-active. Later, in 1978, he requested and was granted entry into a USAF reserve programme. Leaving active military service he moved to Gunnison, Colorado, and took up a position with Bo Calloway, owner of the Crested Bute Ski area. The appointment was arranged by Colby.\n\nDuring 1980 he received a visit from two men who informed him he was being reactivated, but into the US Army instead of the Air Force. He was sent to the US Army Flight School for rotary wing training at Fort Rucker. From there he was assigned to the 160th Aviation Battalion/Special Forces at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. Shortly afterwards, the 160th combined with others to form Task Force 160.\n\nIt was in this unit that Tatum played a \u0093spooky\u0094 role in the US invasion of Grenada. A photograph of him standing in front of his Hughes MD-500 Defender gunship on the beach-head in Grenada, appeared in the Lousiville Courier Journal, along with a feature story. Tatum will only say of this episode that he \"wasn't there\" in the same sense that he \"wasn't in Cambodia.\" At that time he was attached to the US Army's 160th air wing at Ft. Campbell. Not only was the Hughes helicopter then not in the Army's inventory, but the 160th didn't officially exist. Jim Malone of the Louisville Courier, finds this extraordinary. He has documents showing the wing was stationed at Ft. Campbell, even though officials in the Pentagon continue to deny it - as they deny the wings\u0092 role in Grenada. Malone, in a telephone conversation with this writer, advised that the 160th is now stationed at Fort Bragg, North Carolina - home of the famous Special Forces, the \u0093Green Berets.\u0094 Their mission is to fly \u0093Delta Teams\u0094 on covert assignments, Malone added.\n\nTHE CONTRA COKE TRAIN\n\nDuring 1983, Colby established contact again advising him he would shortly be contacted by \"a man called North.\" This, as Tatum was to later discover was none other than Lt. Col. Oliver North - the central architect of America\u0092s Nicaraguan Contra campaign. Besides fighting a covert war, North was also the link-man in much, much dirtier work.\n\nThe \"Contragate\" years teem with well documented accounts of illicit wholesale gun running and dope smuggling. The expose series published in Autumn 1996 by the San Jose Mercury Post, entitled the \"Dark Alliance,\" openly finger-points at the CIA and the Reagan administration for turning a blind-eye to massive Cocaine smuggling. Moreover, the series of articles claim that the explosion of \"crack Cocaine\" in Los Angeles resulted entirely from the Contra leaders-cum-dope peddlers who made vast personal fortunes from their activities. Today, the official argument remains that the Contra's were \"freelancing\" without the knowledge or consent of their CIA \"handlers\" or North\u0092s so called \u0093Enterprise.\u0094 Despite these assertions, mountains of hard evidence point in a different direction including an entry from North's own diary which shows his knowledge of Cocaine shipments.\n\nIn stark contrast to these denials, Tatum says North's \"Enterprise\" not only set-up the Cocaine factories, \"ran\" the Colombian cartels but were also responsible for master-minding the massive shipments of narcotics into the US. Significantly, he is not alone in making these accusations. A number of those involved in Col. North's operations have subsequently come forward and spilled the beans. Almost all of these \"whistle-blowers\" have been hounded and jailed. Some have died, whilst others have fled. The whole Contra thing, Tatum states, was also being used by an extremely covert group called Pegasus.\n\nDuring February 1985, Tatum was piloting \"Dustoff\" (Medevac) flights for the US Army's 3/498th Medical Company, stationed at Fort Stewart, Georgia. Two flight crews, including Tatum's, were transferred to Palmerola Air Base, Honduras. Each flight consisted of a Pilot, co-pilot, medic and crew chief. Once familiarised they assumed the Medevac mission for Joint Task Force Bravo. In 1984, he had previously infiltrated the 3/498th on the instructions of Lt. Col. Oliver North - who had established contact under the code-name \u0093Jake\u0094 (North had \u0093control\u0094 of the 160th air wing and was also deeply involved with the tactical planning of \u0093black ops\u0094 missions in the Grenada invasion).\n\nOn 15 February 1995, during a flight to La Cieba, Honduras, he was instructed to contact his local \"handler\" - Major Felix Rodriguez - later to prove a major figure in the Iran-Contra investigation. Rodriguez informed Tatum that in addition to his Army \"Medevac\" duties he was to support covert \"Pegasus\" missions. These, he was told, would take priority over his other duties. He was also given his \"chain of command;\" three individuals - any of whom could authorise Pegasus missions.\n\nIn addition to Oliver North and Felix Rodriguez, Tatum would, henceforward, take orders from Amiram Nir, a former Mossad agent and Advisor to Vice President Bush. Aviation support for Pegasus missions operated out of Ilapongo airbase, Honduras (home of the CIA proprietary airline Corporate Air Services) plus numerous Contra camps located in the jungles and mountains along the Honduras/Nicaragua border. A common feature of all future Pegasus missions was the transport \"of large white coolers in and out of the Contra camps.\"\n\nOn 26 February 1985, Tatum and his crew were instructed to fly two individuals to one of the larger Contra camps on the Honduran border. His flight log lists the names of the two individuals as Bill Cooper and Buzz Sawyer - both of whom worked for Corporate Air Services. Following a meeting between the CIA agents and Contra leaders, Tatum was given a sealed cooler marked \"Vaccine\" weighing approximately 200 lbs and instructed to deliver it to a USAF C 130 transport plane at La Mesa airport, Honduras. Two crew members off-loading the cooler accidentally dropped it breaking the seal. Inside was over 100 bags of Cocaine. Tatum resealed the cooler and later watched as it was transferred aboard the C-130 outward bound for Panama.\n\nOn his return to Palmerola Air Base, Tatum phoned Col. North advising him of his discovery. North replied that it was \"a trophy of war\" and that the \"Sandinistas are manufacturing Cocaine and selling it to fund the military.\" North closed the conversation by saying that \"the Cocaine was bound for the world courts as evidence\" against the Sandinistas.\n\nThe whole incident struck him as odd and strongly reminded him of earlier missions dating back to 1983-4 when he was stationed at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, as a Special Operations Pilot. Regularly he would tranship white coolers marked as \"medical supplies\" to Little Rock Air Force Base, Arkansas. On two occasions he carried similar coolers to Mena airport, Arkansas. Deliveries of medical coolers to Mena were picked up by Dr. Dan Lassater - a close confidant of then Arkansas Governor, Bill Clinton. Now almost two years later he decided to document his discovery to safeguard his \"retirement.\" Thereafter, all Pegasus flights were documented on the reverse of his flight logs.\n\nThis was a difficult time for Tatum, since he had three balls to juggle at the same time. On the one hand he was flying classified active duty missions for the US Army, on the other he was flying CIA missions arranged through Mil Group A (CIA) - located at the embassy in Tegucigalpa - and thirdly he was flying Pegasus missions under the control of William Colby, Oliver North and George Bush following his recruitment into Pegasus by Colby in 1986,\n\nTatum completed numerous missions during his rotation to Honduras. Picking up and trans-shipping coolers containing Cocaine was a regular event. Extraordinarily, this included infiltrating Nicaraguan airspace (Tatum says it was not difficult to infiltrate any country and that Foreign Powers would kill to know how it is done) and landing at Bluefields Airbase with deliveries for placement aboard USAF C-123's and C-130's. This was followed by a brief stint to Columbia, where he had been assigned to assist the Drug Enforcement Agencies \"war on drugs,\" only to discover the DEA were heavily engaged in narcotics trafficking.\n\nTHE BOSS HOG LIST\n\nOne of the most flamboyant individuals involved in the Cocaine trail from Columbia through Honduras, Panama and on in to the United States, was Barry Seal. Seal flew an assortment of aircraft, off-loading shipments of weapons in South America, and picking up deliveries of Cocaine for his return flight to the US on behalf of Col. North's \"Enterprise.\" His primary base of operations was Mena airport, Arkansas. Seal, a CIA \"asset\" was later arrested and became a Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) informer. Prior to his killing in 1986 - allegedly by a Medellin Cartel assassination squad in revenge for informing on them - Seal openly boasted he had information that implicated high government officials - including then Vice President Bush - in the Enterprise' narcotics trafficking business.\n\nTatum would soon get to meet Barry Seal and become close friends. Later, after Seal's death Tatum recalled being present during a meeting between Oliver North, Felix Rodriguez, Amiram Nir and General Alverez from Honduras, when North stated that Vice President Bush was going to have his son, Jeb, arrange \"something out of Columbia.\" This conversation focused on Barry Seal's increasingly notorious activities. Tatum later made the connection that he was present when Seal's fate had been decided. The discussion also made it clear that VP Bush, Governor Clinton and his three respective \"handlers\" were knee-deep in the Cocaine venture and making a fist load of money.\n\nUnknown to all those present, Seal had earlier provided Tatum with a list of names of those high government officials deeply involved with or responsible for controlling the narcotics business. Seal called them the \"Boss Hogs.\" This has remained a tightly held secret by Tatum until recent weeks. The list cites the surnames and is re-produced below as I received it, complete with mis-spellings where they have occurred. I have appended their full names and titles in brackets where appropriate/available.\n\nUNITED STATES\n\nCasey - (Director of Central Intellignece William Casey)\n\nClair-George (Clair Elroy George - Head of CIA's Central American Task Force)\n\nBush - (Vice President George Bush)\n\nKissinger - (Dr. Henry Kissinger, Chmn Kissinger Associates, former US Secretary\n\nof State, former National Security Adviser)\n\nHaig - (General Alexander Haig, former Secretary of State)\n\nGreg - (Donald Gregg, former National Security Adviser to VP Bush,\n\nambassador to Korea and alleged joint \"controller\" of Panama's Manuel\n\nNoriega, along with William Casey).\n\nClairage (Duane \"Dewey\" Clarradge, CIA)\n\nFernandez (Joseph Fernandez - CIA Costa Rican Station Chief)\n\nNorth (Lt. Col. Oliver North - National Security Council Aide)\n\nSinglaub (John Singlaub, CIA covert operator)\n\nColby (William Colby, Director of Central Intelligence 1973-76)\n\nSecord (Richard V. Secord, regarded as a \"brilliant\" CIA black operative)\n\nWeld (William Weld, head of Criminal division, US Justice Department -\n\ninstrumental in \"blocking\" Senate investigations into narcotics\n\naccording to testimony of former Senate special investigator, Jack\n\nBlum)\n\nRodriguez (Felix Rodriguez, CIA officer with close connection to VP Bush)\n\nPeroot (General Peroot, Defence Intelligence Agency)\n\nMost, if not all, of these names are readily familiar to Contragate investigators and journalists covering this story. Allegations regarding the involvement of former President George Bush in the Cocaine business are by no means new - they abound in plentiful supply. The fact that Bush pardoned a number of his closest advisors - who faced criminal prosecution and possible jail - late on Christmas eve 1992, just weeks before Bill Clinton's inaugeration, left a sour taste in the mouths of many. If prosecuted they clearly would've fingered the President himself.\n\nPEGASUS - DIRTY MONEY LAUNDERING\n\nBut Tatum's story takes us even further along the dark road of power, greed, and corruption. During l986, he had left Honduras and set up a money laundering business in Watertown, New York State - close to the home base of the Army's 10th Mountain Division at Fort Drum. The location was chosen with care. With access to Fort Drum's telephone lines for secure communications, he was assigned a Cherokee 140 helicopter used to ship personnel and supplies - under radar cover - across the Canadian border. His tenure with these companies lasted from 1986 through to 1990. This was a pure Pegasus operation.\n\nIt was at Watertown, that Tatum was provided with a civilian cover in the form of three construction companies: American National Home Builders; American Constructors and American Homes. Funding was provided by Henry Hyde, Republican politician for Illinois - well known as the CIA's \"black\" money-man. Hyde provided a $250,000 line of credit with Key bank, Watertown. Although Tatum was listed as the President in all three companies, all were in reality under the control of Ben Whittaker, a lawyer from Rochester, New York. Whittaker, Tatum says, is closely associated with Tony Wilson of the Wilson family who owned Xerox Corporation. They are extremely wealthy and \"friends of the Rothschilds and Rockerfellers.\" In addition, he was also closely associated with South Eastern US Investment Group (SEUS) - an investment bank in Savannah, Gorgia, from 1985 through to 1989. Another proprietary he was associated with was Irving Place Development, a service organisation of Irving Bank and Trust Company. Cocaine proceeds were laundered through these companies by an ingenious use of construction loans.\n\nIn response to a question asking why was the \"drug related money\" placed in \"Arkansas Colorado and Ohio,\" Tatum simply explains that he doesn't know why, adding that \"It was being done before I got there. I assume banking laws and whether or not Bush had people in his pocket in these areas.\" He does explain that the primary figure involved in the laundry exercise in Arkansas, was \"Jack Stevens.\" Jackson Stevens, owner of Worthen Bank & Trust Company is closely aligned with President Bill Clinton. Tatum states that \" Clinton received the cash and divided it up between Stevens and [Dan] Lasater to clean it up. Stevens company [Worthen bank] was used as the guarantor providing 'warehouse' lines of credit.\"\n\nDeveloping this theme in more detail, Tatum explains that the \"Enterprise\" were receiving drugs in exchange for the guns they supplied to the Contra's. The raw product in the form of coca leaves was supplied by the Colombians and pressed into large cube-shaped bales and then shipped to Nicaragua and Honduras. All the \"product\" was pre-sold and the delivery into the US \"guaranteed.\"\n\nThis eventually resulted in the sale proceeds being pre-paid to Panama, under Noriega's control. Some of this money was washed through banks and other companies operating in Panama and elsewhere. The rest was sent to Arkansas, Ohio and Colorado. Thereafter, the dirty money was filtered via construction loans with permanent \"takeouts\" \"arranged by banks and mortgage lenders.\" These, in turn, were later sold to Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's - negotiable US Federal securities that are traded globally on a daily basis. Each laundry \"cycle\" lasted from six months to a year. The result was dirty money transformed into good, clean US currency.\n\nThis system wasn't arbitrary or accidental. One initial \"test-bed\" was a small residential mortgage lender named Carl I Brown (CIB), in Kansas. Others were larger and still others became national. All were ultimately destined to be purchased by a bank (proprietary) from Japan within a specific time-frame: 1996 - as part of ongoing Pegasus plans. Eric Brown, the son of the founder of CIB was heavily involved in these activities. Three additional companies were involved to Tatum's knowledge: US Homes, Pulte Homes and Richmond Homes. All became very successful, providing \"The American Dream - as VP Bush put it in a meeting in 1987.\"\n\nPEGASUS - ASSASSINATION & NEUTRALIZATION\n\nTatum has gone into considerable additional detail regarding the role of Pegasus as he knew it. He believes Pegasus was established during the Eisenhower years as a secret group inside the CIA to spy on that agency on behalf of the President. At some point - believed to be after the assassination of President Kennedy - Pegasus went AWOL from direct US government control and came under the direction of an international Board of Directors which Tatum alleges now include George Bush and Henry Kissinger.\n\nThe directors of Pegasus meet once a year in secret conclave following G7 meetings. The group have \"representation\" from a number of intelligence agencies throughout the world. These included the US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) agents, plus agents from British, Israeli, Turkish and Danish Intelligence, plus \"others who performed various functions for Pegasus.\" The mission of Pegasus, Tatum explains, is \" to 'align' world leaders and financiers to our (US) policies and standards.\"\n\nOne of Tatum's Pegasus duties included flying \"Archer Teams\" (a four man hit team) in his helicopter to their insertion point. He states that Enrique Bermudez was assassinated in 1991 by a Pegasus teams, adding he \"was shot in the back of the head while walking down the street from about 150 yards.\" Bermudez, known as \"Commander Zero\" was the senior Contra leader. Tatum received two broken ribs when he came under small arms fire during the assassination. Following the Nicaraguan war, Bermudez sought a prominent position in the new government. Spurned by President Chamarro, \"Commander Zero\" tried to pressure Bush to intercede on his behalf, threatening to expose Bush's role in the Cocaine trafficking enterprise. Bush ordered his disposal.\n\nAnother Pegasus assassination was that of General Augusto (Dr. Gus) Alverez, the \"co-operating\" Army Chief of Staff, Honduras. Alverez was assassinated in 1989, following his demand for a bigger split of the Cocaine profits. Tatum also describes his involvement in the assassination of Amiram Nir - the former Israeli Mossad agent who went under the assumed name, Pat Weber. Nir was scheduled to testify to the Senate subcommittee and it was feared he would reveal the truth. He perished following the shooting down of his aircraft with missiles from Tatum's helicopter.\n\nOther \"neutralisations\" verge on the bizarre. An individual who must remain nameless for a variety of reasons - but whose name is known to this writer - underwent an experience that is both horrific and chilling. Readers are warned that what follows is not at all pleasant. For sake of ease we shall call this individual \u0093Mr X\u0094 or simply \u0093X.\u0094\n\nMr. X was a leader of one of the largest CIA-backed Contra groups. He recently testified before the US Senate Intelligence Committee. Formerly, Mr X was a senior executive in a South American subsidiary of leading US soft drinks corporation. During his Senate testimony, he denied any knowledge of CIA involvement in the narcotics trade, adding that condoning such activity would have been foreign to his way of life. Not so, says Tatum. Mr X had been recruited into the CIA by then Director, William Casey, with the assistance of Oliver North.\n\nIn 1990, when Nicaraguan leader, Daniel Ortega, announced there would be \"free elections,\" X was ecstatic. He began jostling for position and asked President Bush ensure he be given a prominent position in the new government - in return for his years of toil at the behest of the CIA and the \u0093Enterprise.\u0094 The pressure came in a form that Bush could not ignore. Failure to help his friend would result in X\u0092s intimate knowledge of Bush's involvement in the dope trade being made public. His threat left Bush with a sour taste. A Pegasus team was assigned to \u0093neutralise\u0094 him in early 1990.\n\nX, Tatum states \"fancied himself a lover of women. Tall, large-breasted blondes were his favourite. It was determined that, if effectively neutralised, [X] could be an asset. Therefore, it was decided that intimidation would be used to control [X].\" They choose to use the drug \"Scopolamine\" which also went by the nickname \"Burundanga\" or the \"Voodoo drug.\"\n\nThe drug is extracted from the pods of a flowering shrub that grows in remote regions of South America. In it's processed, powdered form, \"Scopolomine\" is \"void of smell, void of taste.\" When properly administered \"it causes absolute obedience,\" without this being \"observable by others.\" Importantly, the target will not recall any of the events that occurred during the period they were under the spell of the drug. In outlining these details, Tatum adds that it is important to administer the drug in the correct dosage and that he has known targets to die from too high a dose. Others have \"remained under the influence of Burundanga for up to three weeks.\" Precise dosage can be achieved by liquid ingestion; the powder being readily soluble. Ingestion via cigarettes is also an optimum method of ingestion. It is fast acting and takes no more than 20 minutes to work.\n\nX was invited to spend a relaxing week-end at a luxury hotel as a guest of his friend George Bush. The evening started with cocktails and was followed by a fine meal. \"Nothing but the best were the orders.\" Following the meal, he was ushered into the suite of a blonde \u0093bomb-shell,\u0094 supplied by the CIA. A dose of Burundanga had been ingested during pre-dinner cocktails.\n\nHis host for the week-end was a trusted18 year veteran field intelligence officer. X was gallant with the blonde as they both moved into the bedroom where video cameras were already set-up in one corner. In short order, the blonde had X standing naked in front of her, slipping his manhood in her mouth. All the while the video cameras whirred. Slowly stripping off, the blonde then instructed X to reciprocate the favour. Naked, the blonde boasted a large erect penis, saying \"now take it in your mouth,\" He obliged, his love-making recorded 24 frames a second on celluloid. The male prostitute was hired, Tatum says, from a bar in New York and killed the same evening.\n\nTwo weeks later, X - wholly unaware of the events of that evening - was visited in Nicaragua. He was presented with a copy of the video footage along with instructions. Tatum says that X can never allow that video to be seen \"Not only does it reveal his homosexuality, but it also reveals his bestiality and satanic worship rituals.\" As frame after frame flicked by, X wept, forced to watch himself kill and gut his homosexual lover, and then eat the still warm heart. Neutralised, Mr X became a leading member of the Nicaraguan government a few short weeks later.\n\nPLANNING FOR RETIREMENT\n\nSince 1985, when he first became aware of the Enterprise drug smuggling, Tatum began collecting documents, audio and video tapes for his \"retirement.\" He was acutely aware that most deep cover agents do not survive long in what is a very dirty game at a high-stakes poker table.\n\nWhen in 1992, President Bush instructed him to \"neutralise\" Presidential runner Ross Perot, Tatum refused. He turned over a copy of an incriminating tape to President Bush, explaining that it would not be released, providing he, his family and Perot were kept safe. He also told the President that copies of the tape had been placed in six different locations world-wide, and that \"if I didn't contact these capsule-holders by a certain time each year, they are to be sent to the addresses on the packaging.\" He closed the conversation by stating that when he originally \"placed the packages, I gave explicit instructions that if I asked for them to be sent back to me, they were to send them to the addresses on the packages.\" This, Tatum reasoned, would avoid intimidation or torture.\n\nENDS\n\nIn part two we further examine Tatum's extraordinary account of his deep-cover life in Pegasus: included will be George Bush's \"scope and mission\" paper for the New World Order, which reveals details of the private corporation that is to be the nucleus of the \"international master plan for world growth and stability.\" We also cruise through Tatum's narrative of the \"Super Bills\" story - how the CIA provided the Shah of Iran with plates and equipment to print \"perfect\" counterfeit $100 bills and how Pegasus used these in the Iran-Contra scandal.\n\nAlso covered is the hidden story why Colombian Cocaine cartel member Pablo Escobar was shot and killed; why Panama's Manuel Noriega warranted a full scale US invasion and imprisonment; and what lay behind the mysterious 1996 death of former Director of Central Intelligence, William Colby. Not least we will examine the shocking role of star prosecution witness Gabriel Taboada, who was \"briefed\" by the US Justice department to ensure Noriega received a long-term jail sentence. Additional revelations centre on the involvement of President Clinton and close Clinton confidant, William Barr, in the Mena, Arkansas Cocaine industry. Accompanying Part Two will be the full list of names, from 11 countries, of the BOSS HOGS."
