Compared to Iron Man and Captain America, Thor feels short-changed in both his Avengers appearances. His first solo film narrowly misses a coherent character arc. His second doesn\u2019t give him one at all. He is, at once, one of the most popular Avengers and one of the least narratively interesting. Or rather he was, until New Zealand\u2019s Taika Waititi was handed carte blanche for the character and his grandiose world. To say that Waititi made a weird movie would be a disservice. It\u2019s a really weird piece of an even weirder puzzle, course-correcting Thor\u2019s prior installments while leaning all the way into the Jack Kirby-esque designs of Marvel\u2019s golden age. It has a giant undead wolf. It has a kindly rock monster. It even has a Hulk, but it also has Jeff Goldblum as The Grandmaster, a character so fun and alluring that you forget he\u2019s a human trafficker who sends people to their deaths for sport. Which, in essence, is the thesis of Thor: Ragnarok, a comedy about the effects of downplaying colonialism, made by an unapologetically Maori filmmaker.

The \u201cHomecoming\u201d sub-title has a sly double meaning in North America, but both the phrase and its many localizations \u2013 usually some variant of \u201cReturning Home\u201d \u2013 sent a singular message to most of the world. This was Spider-Man back where he belonged, at the House of Ideas, right alongside characters he\u2019d shared the page with for over 50 years. In order to re-establish him though, Marvel needed to answer a key question following his appearance in Captain America: Civil War: Where does Spider-Man fit in a world of Avengers? The Marvel Cinematic Universe had been around for nearly 10 years by the time we got Spider-Man: Homecoming. This fictional world began shortly after Tobey Maguire vacated the spider-suit, and it continued through Andrew Garfield fizzling out. Tom Holland was to be the third on-screen Spider-Man in under a decade, and separating him from the other two became imperative. In both prior incarnations, Spider-Man was the only hero around and he had to rise to the occasion no matter how big the threat. Holland\u2019s Peter Parker however \u2013 younger, smaller, and of meeker demeanor \u2013 exists in a world much like our own: a world where a kid his age had grown up watching Avengers rule the skies, as the little guys looked up in awe.

Its prologue, set 34 years in the past, features a budding romance later revealed to have twisted implications, but the love on display is still real. Following this comes the Guardians\u2019 raucous reintroduction in present day, a battle against an inter-dimensional beast in a scene bursting with visual slepndour. Its out-of-this-world action however, is backgrounded and out of focus. The spotlight instead falls on a joyous Baby Groot, dancing his way through the scene as the other Guardians \u2013 Star Lord, Drax, Gamora and Rocket \u2013 take turns caring for him as if he were their child. When the Guardians collect their reward for this battle, they stand in contrast to the gilded Sovereign, a homogenous people genetically engineered to be perfect, but a people to whom slights and insults are unforgivable. The Guardians, on the other hand, are a group of broken characters from wildly different origins, but in their case, redemption isn\u2019t off the table. In short, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is about the complicated relationships we rarely confront. It\u2019s told against a backdrop of action and space-opera, but its focus is on a family of imperfect beings, searching for catharsis while helping one another other find some form of redemption. It may very well be Marvel\u2019s most mature film, zeroing in on the emotional complexities of abuse carried forward into adulthood. But it also solidifies the Studio\u2019s new political direction, acting as the first in a trilogy of films (along with Thor: Ragnarok and Black Panther) whose narrative is adjacent to colonial history.

In August of 2014, as Doctor Strange was being written and as Marvel was figuring out where to film it in 15 months time, the studio underwent a significant restructuring. Kevin Feige would no longer answer to Marvel CEO Ike Perlmutter, a notoriously fickle penny pincher and blockade to diversity, nor would Marvel Studios be subject to the Marvel Creative Committee, whose hellish process of studio-notes was a source of contention behind the scenes. Instead, Feige began answering directly to filmmaker-friendly Disney Charmian Alan Horn. Not long after, Marvel announced films like Black Panther and Captain Marvel and directors like Ryan Coogler (Creed) and Taika Waititi (What We Do in the Shadows) after only having had white men be the major focus on either side of the camera. The message was clear. This was a whole new Marvel, and slowly but surely, the work began to reflect it.

The Marvel Cinematic Universe seems to re-invent itself every couple of years. From big, fun crossover action to space-set family soap opera, it\u2019s been laying track one way or another for the upcoming Avengers: Infinity War, but a decade of narrative investment can\u2019t be achieved without a feeling of genuine loss. This year\u2019s culmination re-introduces us to the scattered Avengers, a family at its most discordant after tearing itself apart. And while no Avengers lost their lives in Captain America: Civil War, the team as a whole may have lost its sense of identity. It\u2019s a film where the long-term personal and political narratives boil over, conflicting with one another for reasons both idealistic and petty, and by the end of it, the Avengers implode. It\u2019s a difficult watch at times, even and especially two years later when debates about military intervention rage on. And while it may seem like folly to view a film from 2016 strictly through a lens of America\u2019s 2018 bombing of Syria, this particular real-world intervention isn\u2019t something new. It\u2019s part of a long-standing and long-intervening military apparatus that makes a film like Captain America: Civil War relevant in the first place. The Avengers\u2019 legacy is America\u2019s legacy. And it\u2019s mighty complicated.

While \u201csuperhero fatigue\u201d is by no means a cultural phenomenon \u2013 Avengers: Infinity War could topple Star Wars: The Force Awakens at the opening weekend box office \u2013 it\u2019s most certainly experienced on an individual basis. The bloated Avengers: Age of Ultron, for instance, may not have been everybody\u2019s cup of tea despite being one of this writer\u2019s favourites. Which is perhaps why Marvel Studios, in order to end its run of \u201cPhase 2\u201d films in 2015, decided on a smaller, more intimate project in the vein of a studio comedy. Ant-Man would\u2019ve been very different under director Edgar Wright, who left the project over creative differences in 2013, but that hypothetical scenario assumes there would\u2019ve been an Edgar Wright Ant-Man at all \u2013 that is, once The Avengers swept the globe and the Marvel Creative Committee under Ike Perlmutter was still intact. The Marvel Studios of 2015 was a different beast from the Marvel Studios of 2003 (when Wright first got involved), and while it\u2019s nice to imagine what could have been, Peyton Reed of Yes Man and Bring It On did an ample job with a film that, for better or worse, seems more in his wheelhouse than Wright\u2019s. (Side note: the visual flourishes people seem to think are Wright\u2019s are likely Reed\u2019s doing, though the film feels like the product of conflicting rewrites). That said, it does make us ponder whether going smaller and more personal in theory is really more artistically sound when the decisions still feel like they\u2019ve had their edges sanded down. Like the character leading it, it\u2019s tough for Ant-Man to be truly good when forces beyond its control seem to hold it back at every turn.

How often do we ask ourselves why we created God and the Devil? We\u2019ve been questioning our own existence for thousands of years \u2013 where we came from and what we\u2019ll leave behind \u2013 so to have those ideas pumped into a $300 million superhero sequel, albeit to varying degrees of success, is something of note. We\u2019re well into Marvel being the biggest thing in popular culture with Avengers: Infinity War, but the questions asked by Joss Whedon\u2019s medial crossover are of particular interest when it comes to the Avengers\u2019 iconography. By 2015, our entertainment landscape had become dominated by the violent \u00dcbermensch in a visage of childlike fantasy, and it warranted artistic introspection. Avengers: Age of Ultron is not some Watchmen-esque deconstruction; then again, neither was the 2009 Watchmen movie, which took straight from the pages of the 1986 comic series rather than drawing from the culture around it. Age of Ultron on the other hand came out a mere two years after the destruction debate post-Man of Steel, which focused largely on civilian causalities. Whether as response to the new tenor of superhero conversation or as a means to set up Captain America: Civil War (or both; the intent isn\u2019t mutually exclusive), Age of Ultron places similar debates in its crosshairs, first by making its characters\u2019 top priority the protection of civilians, and then by exploring the ways in which they ought to go about it. The film forces the Avengers to contend with their in-world legacy as a means to explore their fictional legacy on-screen. It\u2019s a narrative nexus, building on what came before while setting up Marvel\u2019s future, as it attempts to define that very nexus for each of its characters. A mirror to our modern pantheon.

Flashback, Comic Con 2012. Marvel Studios head honcho Kevin Feige announces development on Guardians of the Galaxy, to which even seasoned Marvel readers respond: \u201cWait\u2026 Who?\u201d Flashback, Comic Con 2013. Marvel plays the first public footage from the new James Gunn joint to a crowd who had no idea what to expect. I would know. I was there, buzzing with bewildered excitement. And from the moment we got a glimpse of this thing \u2013 a sizzle reel not dissimilar from the film\u2019s first trailer \u2013 we knew we were in for something special. Flash forward, April 2018. The Guardians\u2019 upcoming team-up with the Avengers is currently outselling the last seven Marvel movies combined. Gunn\u2019s superhero space-opera existed independently of the rest of the Marvel Universe (unless you count post-credit scenes, which I do not) and it seemed to exist independently from most sci-fi films in general. Equal parts grimy and bursting with colour, it felt like bright new world that had been used and lived in by ingrates not unlike ourselves. From an idyllic, multi-species utopia led by Marvel\u2019s Nova Corps, to a floating space-penitentiary with alien inmates of all stripes, even to a mining colony within the severed head of an ancient Celestial, the film departed from its relatively grounded predecessors and marked Marvel Studios going full-Marvel Comics. While Asgard in Thor featured a familiar regality, Guardians of the Galaxy represented a major step out into the larger Marvel cosmos, starting off on Earth before ending up in far-flung corners of an unfamiliar universe \u2013 though not without the right characters to guide us through it.
