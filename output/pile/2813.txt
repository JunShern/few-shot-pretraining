It seems appropriate to assume a bad cable could prevent that from happening.  Note that fiber-channel error code is FC_BADDEV, which also seems appropriate for a bad cable.\nIn short, a review of the source code indicates that ENODEV errors are consistent a bad cable.  \nYou can use dTrace to more closely identify the association if necessary.  Given that both hard and transport errors occur about 5 or 6 orders of magnitude more frequently, IMO that effort isn't necessary until the ENODEV errors occur after the other errors are addressed and no longer occur.\n\n"
