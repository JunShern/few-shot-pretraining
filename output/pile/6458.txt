    "text": "Adventures in genealogy\n\nK is for Ksi\u0119gi Parafialne\n\nContinuing the Family History Through the Alphabet Challenge\u2026K is for Ksi\u0119gi Parafialne (Polish for \u201cChurch Books\u201d) via the website http://www.ksiegi-parafialne.pl/. If your family history is Polish, this site is a must and yet it is not mentioned very often among guides to Polish research or \u201cbest of\u201d lists. What is it? A site that lists, by province, every town that has church books indexed. The indexes (indices) are all on other sites \u2013 this is merely an index of indexes and links are included to get you there. As such, this site is only helpful once you\u2019ve discovered the name of the town from which your ancestors came.\n\nFirst, click on \u201cWojew\u00f3dztwa\u201d to find the province. Since the entire site is in Polish, you must look for the Polish name of the province (Pomorskie for Pomerania, etc). Each province has a separate page with a list of towns. Find the town name in the first column, parafia / USC. If available at one of the online sites, it will be listed. The dates in the columns show what records have been indexed for Chrzty/Urodziny (Baptisms/Births), Ma\u0142\u017ce\u0144stwa (Marriages), and Zgony (Deaths). Under Strona www is a link to the web site with the indexed records. There are over a dozen sites that have images (or at least indexes) of the records available. Included among them are Geneteka, which I\u2019ve praised here before, and the Polish church books included on FamilySearch.org. What\u2019s not listed? Anything on microfilm available via FamilySearch \u2013 this site lists only records/indexes available online. As with any record site, some provinces have many more towns with online records available than others. But towns are added weekly and the site is a great way to keep track of what\u2019s available for your ancestors\u2019 towns. There are hundreds listed \u2013 is your ancestors town among them?\n\nOn the main page next to \u201cWojew\u00f3dztwa\u201d you will also see \u201cII Rzeczpospolita\u201d or \u201cSecond Republic\u201d. This list includes areas once associated with Poland during the interwar period. There is also a heading \u201cDokumenty metrykalne\u201d which offers documents that describe the format of the records. However, as the documents are in Polish, it will not nearly be as helpful as various translation guides in English.\n\nFor those of you with Polish ancestry, how cool is it to have a site that lists all available online records? I think it\u2019s great\u2026I just wish Germany had a similar site! Happy searching\u2026"
