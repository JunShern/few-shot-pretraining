For this, in my opinion, should confirm with the clients, since these figures are all provided by the client.\n\nIn the above figure, for the word \u2018Templates\u2019 should also be translated. However, it is not translated either. In my opinion, we also need to confirm with the client and ensure if it needs to be translated or not."
