    "text": "Originally published by Ha\u00efti Libert\u00e9 as \u201cFive years post-quake: Haiti\u2019s promised rebuilding is unfulfilled as Haitians challenge authoritarian rule.\u201d\n\nFive years after the Jan. 12, 2010 earthquake that struck Haiti\u2019s capital region, the loudly-trumpeted reconstruction of the country is still an unrealized dream.\n\n2015 finds Haitians fighting tooth and nail in renewed political mobilizations to create the nation-building project that big governments and aid agencies pledged but then cruelly betrayed.\n\nNorth American and European powers rushed planeloads and shiploads of soldiers and bottled water to Haiti in the days and weeks following the disaster, saying they would help Haiti \u201cbuild back better.\u201d The world was aghast at the rare glimpse of Haiti\u2019s poverty provided by earthquake coverage. Leaders like Bill Clinton even acknowledged that the failed economic policies they had imposed over decades had impoverished Haiti and, indeed, are the source of its economic underdevelopment.\n\nBut the promises of the multi-billion dollar international relief effort and aid which will reach the grassroots have proven largely illusory.\n\nA key admission in the months following the earthquake was that democratic governance and national sovereignty were essential tools for building Haiti on a new and progressive foundation. Today, the lack of democracy and sovereignty is at the epicenter of the political firestorm sweeping the country.\n\nFor many months, the Haitian people have carried out a sustained political mobilization demanding President Michel Martelly\u2019s resignation. They want elections, now postponed for over three years, to bring a new government and parliament that is not afraid to take up the unfinished tasks of post-earthquake reconstruction.\n\nThe protest movement calls itself \u201cOperation Burkina Faso,\u201d inspired by events in that west African nation. In October, the people of Burkina Faso overthrew an unpopular president, Blaise Compaor\u00e9, and his government. Haitians draw inspiration from that event and, crucially, are aware that it is inspired by the socialist, egalitarian and anti-imperialist ideas of former president Thomas Sankara, killed and overthrown by Compaor\u00e9\u2019s forces in 1987.\n\nHaiti\u2019s movement scored an important victory on Dec. 13 when Martelly\u2019s prime minister, Laurent Lamothe, resigned. But Oxyg\u00e8ne David, a leader of the Dessalines Coordination (KOD), one of the parties leading the protests, told Haiti Libert\u00e9 weekly, \u201cLamothe was just the smallest part of a trinity holding Haiti down. The other two elements are Martelly and MINUSTAH. They also must go for Haiti to have democracy and sovereignty.\u201d\n\nMINUSTAH is the UN Security Council military occupation regime that deployed in Haiti in June 2004 to consolidate the Feb. 29, 2004 coup against Haiti\u2019s progressive and elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.\n\nThe next wave of large protests is planned to take place in cities across Haiti on Jan. 12, the earthquake\u2019s fifth anniversary.\n\nForeign occupation and the slide to authoritarian rule\n\nThree factors are driving the protest movement \u2014 Martelly\u2019s march towards authoritarian rule since coming to power in March 2011, the ongoing MINUSTAH occupation, and the failed record of earthquake reconstruction.\n\nAlthough two presidential elections have been held in the years following the 2004 coup against Aristide, both Presidents Ren\u00e9 Pr\u00e9val and Michel Martelly have been dominated by and essentially subservient to imperialist powers. This weak state was dramatically symbolized by the partial collapse of Haiti\u2019s iconic century-old presidential palace in the earthquake. It could not be salvaged and has been razed.\n\nRight after the quake, the U.S., Canada, and Europe rushed Haiti into a election which they brazenly meddled in to establish even stronger neo-colonial rule. A two-round presidential election in November 2010 and March 2011 brought Martelly to the presidency, but only after the Organization of American States (OAS) intervened and illegally changed the outcome. The largest political party in the country \u2014 Aristide\u2019s Fanmi Lavalas \u2014 was excluded, producing the lowest voter turnout of any polling in the Western Hemisphere\u2019s history. The election was entirely financed from abroad.\n\nPresident Michel Martelly finally managed to get his long-time business partner Laurent Lamothe named as prime minister, and the two declared Haiti \u201copen for business,\u201d meaning that foreign, sweatshop factory investment was to be Haiti\u2019s economic salvation, complemented by foreign aid and charity. Public sector intervention to tackle housing, healthcare, education, and other emergency needs was eschewed.\n\nMartelly was a close ally of the extreme right-wing that twice overthrew Aristide in 1991 and 2004. He honored former tyrant Jean-Claude Duvalier, who was driven out of Haiti by a popular uprising in 1986 and was content (and permitted) to live in France until his embezzled funds ran out and he returned to Haiti in January 2011.\n\nMartelly\u2019s family faces widespread allegations of corruption, including abuse of authority, money laundering, and the squandering public funds. But the Haitian people are also alarmed by Martelly\u2019s steady march toward authoritarian rule. Martelly and Lamothe found excuses not to hold parliamentary and municipal elections, allowing electoral mandates expire. Rather than bargain in good faith with his political opposition to create a provisional electoral commission (CEP) to oversee democratic elections, Martelly sought to create a \u201cpermanent\u201d CEP, stacking it with his partisans.\n\nOn Jan. 12, 2015, the mandates of most Parliamentarians expire, effectively dissolving the legislative branch. Martelly says he is then prepared to rule by decree.\n\nIn the past week, Martelly has nominated a controversial prime minister and concocted a political accord that would extend parliamentary terms and guarantee his own survival until May 14, 2016, but as we go to press, six vanguard senators have refused to vote, saying the prime minister and political map forward should come from the opposition and parliament, not Martelly\u2019s back rooms.\n\nHaiti Libert\u00e9\u2018s Thomas P\u00e9ralte reported on Dec. 31 that large political protests (for Martelly\u2019s resignation) took place for the first time ever in Haiti on Christmas Eve. Protesters said there is nothing to negotiate with the doomed regime, some saying they would prefer \u201ccivil war.\u201d\n\nCholera and public health care\n\nTens of thousands of people died in the earthquake, and half the houses in Port-au-Prince, with a population of nearly three million, were destroyed or seriously damaged. Acute needs were intensified \u2013 for health care, sanitation, housing, public education, and economic development (including agriculture).\n\nEarly gains in earthquake relief were achieved with the public health initiatives taken by Haiti\u2019s Public Health Ministry in cooperation with international missions, particularly those of Cuba (working in Haiti since 1999), Partners In Health (present since the 1980s) and many smaller, vital health care projects.\n\nCuban personnel and hundreds of students and graduates from other countries of the Latin American School of Medicine in Haiti fanned out into some of Haiti\u2019s remotest parts to meet new and existing medical needs.[1] Other Latin American countries made substantial contributions to the Cuban-led health care effort. Cuba proposed a plan to the UN to create a comprehensive, public health care program for the country.\n\nThe Boston-based Partners In Health (PIH) expanded its work substantially, including building a second training hospital, opened in Mirebalais in 2012. PIH, too, voiced support and hope for a public health plan.\n\nTragically, the advances in building medical infrastructure suffered a huge blow in the autumn of 2010. The culprit was Haiti\u2019s familiar old nemesis \u2014 foreign political intervention. MINUSTAH soldiers recklessly and criminally introduced cholera into the country when a Nepalese contingent allowed their cholera-infected sewage to flow into Haiti\u2019s largest river system in October 2010. Over four years later, cholera has killed 8,500 people and sickened nearly 800,000, the world\u2019s worst epidemic. The number of reported cases monthly was averaging 2,000 in 2014 but jumped in the latter months of the year.\n\nAlthough UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon has promised money and resources to combat and eventually eradicate cholera, a report one year ago by the Washington DC-based Center for Economic Policy Alternatives noted, \u201cThe UN itself has pledged just one per cent of the funding needed for cholera treatment [estimated $2.2 billion], even as the UN\u2019s mostly military and police mission in Haiti costs over $572 million a year\u201d.\n\nA recent report by Doctors Without Borders (MSF) blames those in authority in Haiti for persistent \u201cshortages of funding, human resources, and drugs\u201d in Haiti\u2019s health care system, including for cholera. The UN as well as the major governments participating in MINUSTAH are denying any culpability for introducing cholera to Haiti and then failing to assist in its prevention. Cholera is easy to treat and prevent if there is the will and funds. It just requires potable water delivery and sanitary sewage disposal. That\u2019s why people in New York or Toronto don\u2019t get or die from cholera.\n\nThe cholera disaster only deepened the festering wound on Haiti\u2019s body politic known as MINUSTAH. The continued presence of the force is an affront to the dignity and sovereignty of the Haitian people. [2]\n\nThe Housing Crisis\n\nHousing was another of the most immediate needs in Haiti following the earthquake. International aid provided short-term shelters to protect from the elements. A reported 110,000 plywood shelters and tens of thousands of tent shelters were provided. Beginning in 2011, one-year rental subsidies were provided to families as an incentive for them to leave tent camps. The camps were an eyesore as well as visible testimony to the absence of substantial programs to build housing.\n\nAfter mountains of studies highlighting the need for a massive home-building program in Haiti, the gains are few. According to a recent fact sheet on housing prepared by Church World Service and the Mennonite Central Committee (drawing on figures reported to UN agencies), some 85,000 earthquake victims still live in 123 camps of internally displaced persons within Port-au-Prince\u2019s city limits.\n\nMany tens of thousands more live in the new, sprawling informal suburban shantytowns of Canaan, Onaville, and Jerusalem, located beyond the pre-earthquake northern limits of the city. By a stroke of a pen, these communities are not considered as earthquake survivor settlements. That also means they don\u2019t qualify for formal assistance.\n\nThirty four per cent of the families that left survivor camps were forced out by people claiming land ownership or by government officials. Twenty two of the remaining camps face eviction.\n\nThe aforementioned fact sheet reports that in the past five years, 27,353 houses have been repaired and 9,053 have been built, at a cost of $215 million. That amount compares to $500 million spent on the plywood shelters, most of which have long since deteriorated in the tropical weather or have been dismantled to build more permanent structures.\n\nThe UN-sponsored housing coordination body said in 2013: \u201cHaiti needs to meet the challenge of constructing 500,000 new homes in order to meet the current housing deficit between now and 2020.\u201d\n\nThe key instrument of Martelly\u2019s housing \u201cpolicy,\u201d in keeping with the \u201cOpen for business\u201d mantra, has been promises of financing for house construction. No housing agency of the government was created. But Haiti does not have networks of personal banking where people could obtain loans, and in any event, the proposal was laughable because most Haitians don\u2019t have incomes to speak of. According to the updated country report on Haiti by the World Bank, more than six million out of Haiti\u2019s population of 10.4 million live under the national poverty line of $2.44 per day. Over 2.5 million Haitians live under the national extreme poverty line of $1.24 per day. How are they to obtain loans to build houses?\n\nIn reality, the most active area of housing policy has been the clearing of survivor camps by force or by short-term economic lures. The latter has been facilitated by the Canada-funded, $20 million program of providing one-year rental subsidies.\n\nEducation\n\nPublic education was another key social need identified after the earthquake. Before the disaster, half of Haitian children did not attend school. The number reaching secondary school was much less. In 2011, the Martelly regime created a national education fund whose goal was said to get every Haitian child into school. It was to be financed by taxes on international phone calls and money transfers, which were never ratified or overseen by Parliament as constitutionally dictated. The plan has been plagued by a lack of transparency, and its achievements are very slim.\n\nSchool administrators say that promised funding under the plan does not get delivered. Or it arrives months late. This year, the opening of the school year in September was delayed by a month because parents said they couldn\u2019t afford to buy the textbooks and other supplies that schools were not supplying.\n\nOne of the outcomes of the fund, according to a lengthy investigation by Haiti Grassroots Watch published (in French) last July is that private schools have been favored over public schools. About 80% of Haiti\u2019s primary and secondary schools are private, typically operated by churches and other charities from abroad.\n\nTeacher unions in Haiti opposed the fund because it had no legislative authority and therefore operates outside of public oversight. Teachers have battled for years to establish a public education system and to pay teachers living wages. Last spring, strike action won salary increases of 30% to 60%, but salaries are still woefully inadequate.\n\nMisguided economic development\n\nEconomic development was cited as key to Haiti\u2019s future following the earthquake, including for agriculture. Most Haitians still live in the countryside, and those forced to move to the cities by economic circumstance have not done so freely. But international aid and governments never came close to fundamental change in this sphere. They rehabilitated the failed dogma that posits Haiti\u2019s low-wage, factory labor force as an economic asset to be built upon. And they perpetuated the neglect of Haiti\u2019s all\u2013important agricultural production, including environmental decline prompted by deforestation.\n\nA centrepiece of the sweatshop labor strategy promoted by former U.S. President Bill Clinton and current presidential aspirant Hillary Clinton is the Caracol Industrial Park, located far from the earthquake zone in Haiti\u2019s north. It was touted to create tens of thousands of jobs when its idea was launched in 2010. But a 2013 investigation by reporter Jonathan Katz revealed that \u201cfewer than 1,500 jobs have been created \u2014 paying too little, the locals say, and offering no job security.\u201d\n\nKatz reports, \u201cHundreds of smallholder farmers were coaxed into giving up more than 600 acres of land for the [industrial park] complex, yet nearly 95% of that land remains unused. A much-needed power plant was completed on the site, supplying the town with more electricity than ever, but locals say surges of wastewater have caused floods and spoiled crops.\u201d\n\nAssembly factories in the new park routinely pay below the meager US$4.76 average daily minimum wage. A report by the International Labor Organization (ILO) and the International Finance Cooperation (IFC) in 2013, which monitor and enforce factories\u2019 compliance with national and international standards, found that all 24 of the factories it monitored in Haiti were \u201cnon-compliant\u201d. All violate occupational safety and health standards. All violate minimum wage laws, and 11 violate overtime standards. None provide adequate health and first aid services, and 22 were in violation of worker protection standards.\n\nAnd what has become of the billions of dollars of aid promised to Haiti\u201d A report by CEPR in 2013 said that much of the aid earmarked for Haiti was not spent in Haiti at all; it went to foreign contractors. \u201c67.1% of USAID contracts has gone to Beltway-based firms, while just 1.3% has gone to Haitian companies\u201d, it wrote. And \u201cof the $6.43 billion do-gooders by bilateral and multilateral donors to Haiti from 2010-2012, just nine percent went through the Haitian government.\u201d\n\nWriting in July of 2014, the CEPR reported that of the $1.38 billion awarded by USAID to projects in Haiti, just $12.36 million has gone to Haitian organizations. Of the Haitian amount, 57% went to Cemex Haiti, a local cement mixing outlet and subsidiary of the Mexican Cemex, the Mexican company that is one of the largest cement producers in the world. (Cemex purchased the former state-owned cement producer in Haiti some 15 years ago.)\n\nA lot of celebrities and other prominent people have come and gone from Haiti over the past five years. Careers have been created or polished up by charitable works. The Clintons come to mind. Many Hollywood actors. Canada\u2019s former governor-general (titular head of state), Micha\u00eblle Jean, was a mouthpiece for the 2004 coup while she was governor general, then she became a Special Ambassador to Haiti for UNESCO following the earthquake. Recently, she rode rough over the objections of African countries to become the head of the Francophonie organization of French-speaking countries. What all these people as well as many other foreign do-gooders shared in common was their support for the political project keeping MINUSTAH and local clients (Martelly or some other derivative of him) in charge of the country, at the expense of the Haitian people.\n\nCEPR Director Mark Weisbrot wrote one year ago that the lasting legacy of the earthquake \u201cis the international community\u2019s profound failure to set aside its own interests and respond to the most pressing needs of the Haitian people.\u201d\n\nBut then there is the Haitian people \u2013 their mounting political actions and their unrelenting determination to build a country based on sovereignty and social justice. And their true and faithful international allies. Like the countries and healthcare projects mentioned earlier in this article. Like the lawyers of Bureau des avocats internationaux (BAI) and Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti (IJDH) who are suing the UN on behalf of the victims of cholera. Like the SOIL sanitation project and the organizations of peasants and farmers of Latin America who are working in the Haitian countryside. Like many school support projects which are an important form of the struggle for public education in Haiti.\n\nThese are the organizations who are working together with the Haitian people to help shape Haiti\u2019s future.\n\nNotes:\n\n[1] For an early 2010 report of these efforts see \u2018Field Notes from Haiti: After the Earthquake\u2019, by MEDICC (Medical Education Cooperation with Cuba).
