Prepare the inside and outside of a 23cm tin, as before. Cream the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy, then gradually beat in the eggs a little at a time. Add a tbsp of the plain flour if it starts to split. Fold in the flours and a pinch of salt, followed by the lemon zest and juice.\n\nSpoon the mix into the tin and bake for 1 hr 35 mins or until well-risen and golden and a skewer inserted comes out clean. Meanwhile, make the syrup by heating the sugar, lemon zest and juice in a small pan until the sugar dissolves. Set aside.\n\nOnce the cake is out of the oven, leave to cool until it\u2019s just warm, then use a skewer to poke holes down to the bottom all over the cake. Pour the syrup over, letting it completely soak in after each addition. Leave to cool completely, then either wrap or fill and ice the cake. The unfilled cake will keep well if you wrap it with baking parchment and cling film for up to 4 days, or in the freezer for up to a month.\n\nAds by Google\n\nComments, questions and tips\n\nI made this for my brother's wedding 6 years ago and since then has been my go to lemon cake recipe. I scale it up and down as needed and even make cupcakes with it. One of the best lemon cakes i've ever eaten (if I do say so myself :))\n\nginnypeace\n\n6th Jan, 2017\n\nI made the whole wedding cake for my daughter's best friend's wedding and it was very successful - everyone loved it! Have just used the Zingy Lemon Cake recipe to make a Baby Shower cake for the same friend. Again it worked really well. As a previous person commented, it is important that the eggs and butter are at room temperature. I always assume large eggs when baking. And yes, I have produced a great 4\" deep cake each time!\n\nKeinEngel\n\n27th Nov, 2016\n\nLemon juice in cake mix meant it didn't rise at all. Went in the bin\n\nThe White Monk\n\n20th Apr, 2017\n\nSorry to hear your cake did not go well. Don't give up. This recipe really does work but needs carful attention. Not suggesting you were not carful in anyway. Did you weigh out the correct amount of lemon juice in the recipe? If you put too much it can mean the cake becomes too moist and does not rise correctly. Weigh everything out carefully and don\u2019t use more than 100 mL lemon juice. Just by the feedbacks on this page its worth having one more go :)\nI have had my disasters too with cakes and I once doubled the lemon juice on this recipe with terrible consequences! I wanted even more lemon flavour!!\nAll the best with your future bakes.\n\nEmzie_essex\n\n25th Sep, 2016\n\n5.05\n\nMy first attempt at a two tier cake...this is very easy and tastes of lovely zingy lemon.\n\nlicciem\n\n2nd May, 2016\n\nTo all those who got a flatter, dense cake: I just made this for my wedding and my first attempt was about 2-3 inches tall and felt pretty dense. My mistakes were:\nI didn't beat the butter and sugar together enough - for those using a kitchen aid, a flex edge beater attachment is a must for this recipe!\nMy butter was too cold\nMy eggs were too cold - make sure both eggs and butter are at warm room temperature when you start baking\nBasically, because there is no rising agent in the cake (other than in the SRF), it relies heavily on the air you beat in at step 1. Another tip, gently fold in the flour, do not beat at this stage.\nI followed the above, and my second attempt was a soft, bouncy, 4inch high cake that can definitely be sliced twice for filling.\nGood luck!\n\nvintagemunchkin\n\n9th Apr, 2016\n\nMade this for my wedding. As others have commented, there's no way this could be sliced into three, really didn't rise as much as I'd hoped. I made the lemon buttercream and added a layer of lemon curd too. Was all lovely. Flavours great.\nCheck out my blog for details: http://itsonlyvintagebutilikeit.com/food-2/its-only-a-wedding-cake-but-i-like-it/\n\nlebrant\n\n21st Oct, 2015\n\nWhy why why, when spending money on expensive ingredients to make this cake, do you not give the size of eggs? I'd love to see the cake \"good food\" made before it was decorated. I followed the recipe exactly and the result was an almost 2\" height (once levelled) cake. The photos show a three layered cake, I would only get two layers from this cake. I used to rate this website, now I don't.\n\njantho61\n\n6th Sep, 2016\n\nI always weigh my eggs in the shell so it weighs a little over, to compensate the shell..... that way the weights are all the same!\n\nGhd22\n\n17th Jan, 2016\n\nIt says if you click on eggs large eggs\n\nPages\n\nI have made a 14 inch square fruit cake for my brothers wedding. next tier is going to be a 12 or 10 inch which goes better. Can anyone help which Size to go for and how to scale this recipe up. Thanks\n\nmelp7922\n\n22nd Jun, 2017\n\nHi, I was searching for a 10\" square lemon cake and this one came up. Is this recipe for that shape/size?\n\ngoodfoodteam\n\n28th Jun, 2017\n\nHi there, we're not sure why this cake came up, it's actually a 9\" round cake. The mixture will not be sufficient for a 10\" square cake tin.\n\nLindaFeatherby\n\n28th Apr, 2017\n\nHelp.....I have made this cake with success before but today (when it matters because I am making it as a wedding cake for a friend's wedding) it is not working. The first one I cooked today seemed to have pockets of uncooked mixture in it and did not rise as much as usual and was denser. Any ideas? thank you\n\ngoodfoodteam\n\n28th Apr, 2017\n\nSorry to here your wedding cake is not working out. How stressful! Make sure you follow the recipe really carefully, using the correct-sized tin. Have all the ingredients at room temperature before beginning and get plenty of air into the butter and sugar - it wants to be really light and fluffy. Add the eggs very gradually and don't be tempted to add too much flour while beating. Fold in the rest of the flour, you don't want to work it too hard. It's also important to make sure the oven is fully up to temperature before putting the cake into the oven. Don't be tempted to check the cake early, opening the oven door, wait until the full cooking time or a few mins before unless it really looks done. We hope these tips help. Good luck!\n\nbrinda100\n\n26th Dec, 2016\n\nDoes anyone know please if this recipe would work if substituting the butter for a dairy free alternative, such as margarine (or something different if anyone else knows a good dairy free butter substitute!) Thanks :)\n\ngoodfoodteam\n\n29th Dec, 2016\n\nThanks for your question. You can substitute the butter but check the side of the pack to see if whatever you are choosing is suitable for baking. If the substiute contains salt then don't add any extra along with the flour in step 1.\n\nReader offer: \u00a310 off + 2 free craft beers\n\nSkills & know how\n\nAs well as helping you decide what to cook we can also help you to cook it.
