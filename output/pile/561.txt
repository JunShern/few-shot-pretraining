    "text": "Friday, July 28, 2017\n\nI'm experimenting with a new style* for my portfolio this week. It's based on the painting process of three of the art for fun images I blogged about last week (umbrella boat, cats, and sheep and giraffe). Even though they're all very different, I used some of the same processes to make the picture (amazing how art can be so similar and yet turn out so different). Still working on how I want the new style to look, but I like the pieces this week better than the ones last week. Here's the progression of paintings:\n\nFinally, I painted a cow with a moo-stache for Colour Collective (the color this week is Portland Orange):\n\nSo far I'm liking the new style, even if it's not completely there yet. I think it's getting close though (or at least I hope so)!What are you working on this week? Have you ever changed your art style? How did it go?*This is not the first time I've changed my art style. It's never easy, but hopefully in the end it will be worth it! It's always been worth it in the past for me. Fingers crossed it will be this time too!\n\nFriday, July 21, 2017\n\nA: Art that's just for\nfun might be in a different style, use a different medium, or it could\neven be a doodle! Art for fun is just for you. It's not part of a project or for your portfolio (though it could be in the future.\n\nQ: Why is it important to take time away from other projects to make art that's just for fun?\n\nA: It can be hard to keep your creativity if you're schedule is full, or if you feel obligated to create only a certain type of art for a project, or your portfolio. Art for fun doesn't have an agenda, so there's no pressure. You can create what you want. It can help you stay creative (and avoid burnout) and the things you learn could help\nyou make art for books or other projects. You never know what's going to happen when you make art without a plan*.\n\n* Not having a plan and doing it for fun doesn't mean you can't be inspired by an illustration prompt, or try new materials to change up your style. (If you've visited my blog before, you might have noticed that I do a lot of art for illustration prompts. This is why.) What it means is that nobody is expecting you to make the art. You can experiment! You can make mistakes!**\n\n** Mistakes are part of the creative process, but sometimes it seems like we don't have room to make mistakes. You don't have to turn in art for fun, or show it to anyone, unless you want to. I don't show all the art for fun on my site, but it's fun to be able to show a few of the pieces I like.Q: Do you have any examples of art for fun?\n\nA: Yes! Here four pieces of art for fun I made this week (notice how different each of these pieces are). Two of them are for illustration prompts. If I were making these for my portfolio, I wouldn't feel like I could experiment with style and medium as much as I did with these:\n\n2. The color for Colour Collective this week was a blue color - Pantone 292 C, to be exact, which is harder to create in traditional mediums when you can't \"pick\" the color like you can digitally. I experimented with watercolor, watercolor crayons, and sponge painting to come up with an umbrella boat with a bear and two birds, and lots of blue:\n\n3. This image is a character study of 3 Cats meowing, but mostly it's another experiment in sponge painting (I love sponge painting, but I can't control it, which is part of the fun and also part of the frustration):\n\n4. Last but not least, I experimented with not using black line for my giraffe and sheep (with a little sponge painting in the background):\n\nThese are all very different, and I learned things from each one that will help me make art in the future, even if it's digital art. If I were only making art for a book or my portfolio, none of these images would exist. If I weren't making art for fun, I wouldn't grow as an artist, and eventually, that would catch up with me.\n\nQ: What does your regular art look like?\n\nA: If you're not familiar with my art, you might not realize how different this art is from what's in my portfolio. Here are my two latest pieces for comparison, one color, one black line:I. Roberta and Bailey (the robot) at the Beach: [Note - even this is different than the art for the book I illustrated (EWE AND AYE) - it's important to keep growing as an artist, IMO.]\n\nAuthor/illustrator Stephanie Ruble has been making art ever since she could hold a crayon, and making up stories since she learned to talk. She's currently working on new picture books, images for her portfolio, and drawing art for unusual holidays. Thanks for visiting!\nPicture Book: Ewe and Aye written by Candace Ryan, Illustrated by Stephanie Ruble - in bookstores now."
