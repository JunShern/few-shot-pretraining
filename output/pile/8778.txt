We tried to keep the topics light because of the season, but circumstances gave rise to discussions of health care and concern for the future.\n\nTwo people I knew had died the previous week, and it was hard for me to keep my mind from wandering to my grieving friends. All in all, it was a pretty depressing day.\n\nI had spent the morning having medical tests and the afternoon talking about illness and death. None of us felt much Christmas joy that day.\n\nOn my way home, I had to make a stop at the bank. As I was leaving, a nice-looking young man was entering. As he walked by me, he smiled and said \"Merry Christmas.\"\n\nMy face must have shown my surprise that a complete stranger would make that wish for me. I was taken aback and hesitated before I turned my head to repeat Merry Christmas to his back.\n\nThose two words, spoken by a stranger, changed my attitude and my day. He will never know how much it meant to me.\n\nWe say Merry Christmas to one another all the time to the extent that it is just a hollow phrase. But that young man made me consider what those words really mean.\n\nThey are words of hope and joy. How much can ever hurt us when we know the happiness of Christ's birth?\n\nLike many others, I sometimes lose the focus of this holiday season. Shopping, wrapping presents and sending Christmas cards can be stressful when there is such a short time between Thanksgiving and Christmas.\n\nPlanning dinner, cleaning and decorating the house distract from the reason we are making all these arrangements. We know all of the cliches and are quick to repeat: \"Jesus is the reason for the season.\" But do we really believe what we say?\n\nThe only preparation we really need to make for the birth of Christ is inside our heart. If the roast isn't done on time and the cat knocks over the tree, what does it really matter?\n\nWe spend so much time on the trappings of Christmas that we often forget the birth of God's only son is why we celebrate. The child born in Bethlehem more than 2,000 years ago changed the world.\n\nI sometimes wonder whether God puts an angel in our lives to bring us back to focus on what is truly important. Although the young man at the bank appeared fairly ordinary, I wouldn't be a bit surprised if his winter coat wasn't hiding a pair of wings.\n\nMay you all have a heartfelt and happy Christmas.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nEmail this article\n\n'Merry Christmas' has new meaning\n\nOne day last week, my friends and I met for lunch. We tried to keep the topics light because of the season, but circumstances gave rise to discussions of health care and concern for the future."
