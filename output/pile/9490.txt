Summary Opinion 2003-52\n\n\n\n                     UNITED STATES TAX COURT\n\n\n\n                    DAK, INC., Petitioner v.\n          COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, Respondent\n\n\n\n     Docket No. 4335-01S.              Filed May 15, 2003.\n\n\n\n\n     Kenneth R. Chiate (an officer), for petitioner.\n\n     Angelique Neal, for respondent.\n\n\n\n     DINAN, Special Trial Judge:    This case was heard pursuant to\n\nthe provisions of section 7463 of the Internal Revenue Code in\n\neffect at the time the petition was filed.   The decision to be\n\nentered is not reviewable by any other court, and this opinion\n\nshould not be cited as authority.   Unless otherwise indicated,\n\nsubsequent section references are to the Internal Revenue Code in\n\f                                - 2 -\n\n\neffect for the fiscal year in issue.    All Rule references are to\n\nthe Tax Court Rules of Practice and Procedure.\n\n     Respondent determined a deficiency in petitioner\u2019s Federal\n\nincome tax of $30,447 for the taxable year ended May 31, 1995,\n\nand an addition to tax pursuant to section 6662(a) in the amount\n\nof $6,089.40.\n\n     The issues for decision are: (1) Whether petitioner failed\n\nto report income in the amount of $120,371 for the year ended May\n\n31, 1995; and (2) whether petitioner is liable for an accuracy-\n\nrelated penalty pursuant to the provisions of section 6662(a) in\n\nthe amount of $6,089.40.\n\n     Some of the facts have been stipulated and are so found.\n\nThe stipulations of fact and the attached exhibits are\n\nincorporated herein by this reference.   Petitioner\u2019s principal\n\nplace of business was in California on the date the petition was\n\nfiled in this case.\n\n                           Background\n\n     DAK, Inc. (hereinafter petitioner) operates a restaurant in\n\nMalibu, California, known as Moonshadows Restaurant\n\n(Moonshadows).   The restaurant is located on the Pacific Coast\n\nHighway in Malibu and overlooks the Pacific Ocean.    The\n\nMoonshadows premises is owned by Dr. Robert Shlens (Dr. Shlens).\n\n     On October 1, 1991, Mr. Marvin Kelson (Mr. Kelson) was the\n\nprincipal of petitioner and entered into a lease with Dr. Shlens\n\f                               - 3 -\n\n\nto operate Moonshadows for a period of 15 years.   The lease\n\nprovided that petitioner would pay a minimum rent of $120,000 per\n\nyear.   The lease also required the payment of a percentage rent\n\nof 7-1/2 percent of annual gross sales if that amount exceeded\n\nthe minimum rent of $120,000 per year.   The lease also provided\n\nthat Dr. Shlens had the right to conduct an audit of\n\nMoonshadows\u2019s operations to verify the amount of its gross sales\n\nfor any given period.\n\n     In 1992, Kenneth R. Chiate (Mr. Chiate) purchased\n\nMoonshadows from Mr. Kelson.   Mr. Chiate is an attorney.   He is\n\nnow the president and sole shareholder of Moonshadows and\n\npurchased the business for reasons other than running the\n\nrestaurant.   He has had nothing to do with the operation of the\n\nrestaurant since he purchased it.\n\n     After Mr. Chiate purchased the restaurant from Mr. Kelson in\n\n1992, Mr. Kelson became Moonshadows\u2019s accountant and bookkeeper\n\nfrom 1992 through 1995.\n\n     In early 1995, Dr. Shlens hired a certified public\n\naccountant, Ms. Cecy Groom (Ms. Groom) to audit petitioner\u2019s\n\nfinancial records.   She was to verify the gross sales reported to\n\nDr. Shlens by petitioner in order to confirm that the amount of\n\nrent being paid to Dr. Shlens by petitioner was correct.    Ms.\n\nGroom\u2019s audit was initially directed to the period June 1994\n\nthrough May 31, 1995 (the applicable period), but was extended to\n\f                               - 4 -\n\n\ninclude the years 1992 through 1996.   Upon completing her audit,\n\nMs. Groom submitted a comprehensive report to Dr. Shlens.\n\n      Moonshadows has a dining room and a bar area.   During the\n\napplicable period, Moonshadows utilized two cash registers that\n\nrecorded dining room sales (register 1) and bar sales (register\n\n2).\n\n      To conduct her audit, Ms. Groom used the cash register tapes\n\nfrom registers 1 and 2 to determine petitioner\u2019s gross sales for\n\nthe applicable period.   She compared daily sales reported on\n\nsales journals, sales tax returns, financial statements, and\n\npetitioner\u2019s monthly reports that were given to Dr. Shlens.     Ms.\n\nGroom also compared the cash register tapes with the daily dinner\n\nand bar sales tickets.   She determined that Moonshadows had sales\n\nin the dining area of $1,298,418 from June 1, 1994, through April\n\n30, 1995, and sales in the bar area of $380,520, for the same\n\nperiod.   Ms. Groom\u2019s audit did not include the month of May 1995,\n\nbecause petitioner\u2019s records for that month were not available\n\nfor analysis.\n\n      Ms. Groom also determined that for the period June 1, 1994,\n\nthrough April 30, 1995, the register tapes reported \u201cother voids\u201d\n\nand \u201cvoids and overrings\u201d of $23,085 and $237,342, respectively.\n\n      In 1997, respondent commenced his audit of petitioner\u2019s tax\n\nyear ended May 31, 1995.   At that time, representatives of\n\npetitioner informed respondent that petitioner\u2019s sales records\n\f                                 - 5 -\n\nfor the fiscal year ended May 31, 1995, had been destroyed or\n\nmisplaced.    Having become aware of Ms. Groom\u2019s audit, respondent\n\nexamined her audit report for the applicable period and adopted\n\nit in principal to determine petitioner\u2019s gross sales for the\n\nperiod June 1, 1994, through April 30, 1995.   Respondent also\n\nrelied upon petitioner\u2019s \u201cStatement of Revenues, Expenses and\n\nRetained Earnings\u201d for the month ended May 31, 1995.\n\n     After reviewing Ms. Groom\u2019s audit report and petitioner\u2019s\n\n\u201cStatement of Revenues, Expenses and Retained Earnings\u201d for the\n\nmonth ended May 31, 1995, respondent determined that petitioner\n\nhad gross sales of $1,808,423 for the fiscal year ended May 31,\n\n1995.   From that amount, respondent allowed the following\n\ndeductions:\n\n           Sales tax                      $108,318\n           Other voids                      23,085\n           Voids and overrings             237,342\n                                          $368,745\n\n     Respondent deducted from the amount of gross sales\n\n($1,808,423) the foregoing amount of $368,745 and calculated an\n\namount of net gross sales of $1,439,678 for the applicable\n\nperiod.   The record shows that petitioner does not challenge the\n\namounts determined as deductions for sales tax, other voids, and\n\nvoids and overrings.\n\n     On its Federal income tax return for the fiscal year ended\n\nMay 31, 1995, petitioner reported income of $1,319,308.   In his\n\nnotice of deficiency dated January 3, 2001, respondent determined\n\f                                - 6 -\n\nthat petitioner failed to report income for its fiscal year ended\n\nMay 31, 1995, in the amount of $120,371.\n\n                              Discussion\n\n     We are asked to decide (1) whether petitioner may deduct\n\nfrom its gross sales for the taxable year ended May 31,1995,\n\n\u201cdouble-ups\u201d in the amount of $120,371 and (2) whether petitioner\n\nis liable for an accuracy-related penalty pursuant to the\n\nprovisions of section 6662(a) in the amount of $6,089.40.\n\n     Deductions are a matter of legislative grace, and a taxpayer\n\nbears the burden of proving that it is entitled to any deduction\n\nclaimed.1    Rule 142(a); INDOPCO, Inc. v. Commissioner, 503 U.S.\n\n79, 84 (1992); Deputy v. du Pont, 308 U.S. 488 (1940); New\n\nColonial Ice Co. v. Helvering, 292 U.S. 435, 440 (1934).\n\n     Section 6001 requires all taxpayers to maintain sufficient\n\nrecords to determine their tax liabilities.    When a taxpayer\n\nfails to maintain adequate books and records, respondent is\n\nentitled to reconstruct the taxpayer\u2019s income by any reasonable\n\nmethod.     Holland v. United States, 348 U.S. 121 (1954); Ferenc v.\n\nCommissioner, T.C.

See sec. 7491.\n\f                                 - 7 -\n\nTestimony of Kenneth R. Chiate\n\n     Mr. Chiate is president and sole shareholder of Moonshadows.\n\nHe described the restaurant and how it operated.    There is a bar\n\nin Moonshadows that seats between 40 to 50 people.   There is a\n\ncash register in the bar (register 2).   That register would ring\n\nup drinks ordered by bar patrons.\n\n     If a patron were to leave the bar and go to the dining room\n\nfor a meal, the bar ticket would follow the patron from the bar\n\nto the dining room.   There was a cash register in the dining room\n\n(register 1).   The server would then serve the patron his meal at\n\nthe dinner table.   If he wanted another drink during his meal,\n\nthe server would go back to the bar with the patron\u2019s bar ticket\n\nand the bartender would add the drink to the bar ticket.   The\n\nserver would retain possession of the bar ticket.    At the end of\n\nthe meal, the server would add up the amount of the patron\u2019s\n\ndinner ticket and his bar ticket to compute the total owed by the\n\npatron for his meal and drinks.\n\n     Mr. Chiate testified that you cannot determine the total\n\nsales of the restaurant by adding up the dinner and bar cash\n\nregister tapes because there would be \u201cdouble-ups\u201d, i.e., the\n\nsame charge for a drink would appear on the bar cash register\n\ntape and the dining room cash register tape.\n\n     Respondent asked Mr. Chiate if it were not true that you\n\ncould look at the cash register tapes from the bar and determine\n\f                                  - 8 -\n\nthe amounts transferred to the cash register tapes in the dining\n\nroom.   He was shown what had been received in evidence as Exhibit\n\n15-P, a reconciliation of a bar register tape with the dining\n\nroom register tape.      That exhibit reads as follows:\n\n                 Gross                $1,035.81\n                 Key V                   156.06\n                 O.R.                     12.00\n                 Comp                      0.00\n                 Net                     867.75\n\n     Mr. Chiate was able to identify the gross as gross income\n\nfrom bar sales, the O.R. as overrings, the comp as complimentary\n\ndrinks and the net as the result of subtracting the Key V, O.R.,\n\nand comp amounts from gross sales to arrive at net bar sales.       He\n\nprofessed ignorance of the Key V code, however, stating: \u201cI can\u2019t\n\nidentify that code, Your honor.      I don\u2019t personally know what\n\nthat code stands for.\u201d      Upon further cross examination by\n\nrespondent, Mr. Chiate testified as follows:\n\n          Q. Okay. Mr. Chiate, you just testified you\n     don\u2019t know what a key V transaction is?\n\n          A. I don\u2019t know what that code is on the cash\n     register, that\u2019s correct.\n\n          Q. Okay.       Do you know what O/R stands for on this\n     document?\n\n          A. I believe O/R--on that document, I\u2019m not\n     certain, but I know that O/R was an abbreviation for\n     over-ring that was frequently used in other documents.\n     It may or may not be for this purpose.\n\n           Q.   And comp?\n\n          A. Comp is when the bartender decided to\n     complimentary provide a drink to a good customer, or\n\f                                 - 9 -\n\n     somebody who was unhappy with a meal, and a manager\n     authorized a complimentary beverage, or meal.\n\n          Q. This is a reconciliation of the bar register,\n     isn\u2019t that correct?\n\n          A. I\u2019d have to look at the document. I don\u2019t\n     know. I mean I\u2019d have to compare all the tapes to\n     determine for this particular day whether this is just\n     the bar or not.\n\n          Q. Okay. So you\u2019re not able to identify what\u2019s a\n     bar tape and what\u2019s the register tape?\n\n          A.   That\u2019s correct.\n\nFinally, respondent asked:\n\n          Q. Okay. So, just to clarify, it\u2019s your\n     testimony today, well, essentially that you cannot tell\n     from the register tapes if there\u2019s a double up?\n\n          A. Well, I think you can tell. You may not be\n     able to do it as precisely and certainly as the Service\n     has requested, but I think that you can tell--\n\n          Q.   Okay.\n\n          A.   --that there\u2019s a double up.\n\n     Mr. Chiate then assumed the role of interrogator on behalf\n\nof petitioner.2   He called as petitioner\u2019s witness, Mr. Michael\n\nOzenne.\n\nTestimony of Michael Ozenne.\n\n     Mr. Ozenne is a C.P.A. who has an M.B.A.   He has had his own\n\npractice since 1971.   He began working for petitioner in 1997.\n\nHis assignment was to \u201cmonitor\u201d the audit being conducted by\n\n\n     2\n          \u201cA corporation or an unincorporated association may be\nrepresented by an authorized officer of the corporation\u201d. Rule\n24(b).\n\f                              - 10 -\n\nrespondent and to refute respondent\u2019s proposed deficiency.\n\nRespondent had substantially completed his audit of petitioner at\n\nthat time, and Mr. Ozenne was called upon to negotiate with\n\nRevenue Agent Caprio, who was conducting the audit of petitioner.\n\n     When Mr. Chiate called Mr. Ozenne as a witness for\n\npetitioner, Mr. Ozenne took the witness stand, carrying with him\n\na bundle of notes.\n\n     Mr. Chiate asked Mr. Ozenne to explain to the Court what he\n\nhad done to document the fact that there was no deficiency for\n\nthe year at issue.   He was asked to \u201cstart from the beginning,\n\nand just explain to the Court what you\u2019ve done in that respect.\u201d\n\nCounsel for respondent was otherwise occupied, and the Court\n\nasked the witness what he was referring to.   The Court was\n\ninformed that the witness had made notes of points that he wanted\n\nto cover in his testimony although he opined that he probably\n\ncould not cover his material if Mr. Chiate did not inquire.\n\n     Mr. Chiate agreed with Mr. Ozenne\u2019s observation and then\n\ninformed the Court that he would be using Mr. Ozenne\u2019s notes for\n\nexamination.   Respondent did not object, and the interrogation\n\nproceeded.\n\n     Mr. Ozenne testified that he met with Mr. Caprio,\n\nrespondent\u2019s auditing agent, and they discussed the subject of\n\noverrings.   Mr. Caprio agreed that overrings were included in\n\nrespondent\u2019s determination of unreported income, and he reduced\n\f                             - 11 -\n\nrespondent\u2019s original determination of unreported income of\n\n$380,000 to $120,371, the amount proposed in the notice of\n\ndeficiency.\n\n     Mr. Ozenne then testified that, in his opinion, the $120,371\n\nwas principally due to the double-ups, discussed supra.    By\n\nanalyzing restaurant records from periods other than the\n\napplicable period (June 1994 through May 31, 1995), he could\n\nprove that the \u201c$120,000\u201d unreported income could be accounted\n\nfor by showing that the entries from the bar tapes were\n\nduplicated on the entries from the back end of the restaurant\n\nwhere the dinner tapes included the entries on the bar tapes.\n\n     Mr. Ozenne explained his double-up theory as follows:\n\n          Well, what I did, if you take the IRS\u2019s proposed\n     adjustment of $120,000 and you divide by 365 days,\n     because they were open every day except Christmas and\n     Thanksgiving, you get an average of $328. So our\n     contention is that approximately $328 worth of drinks\n     every day were added to tape two (2) and to tape one\n     (1) which are double counted.\n\n          What we did initially is we took the day of July\n     2nd and we added up all the double counts on that one\n     and it came to $183. Because that was a small group of\n     tapes, it was probably a weekday that was slow for some\n     reason. We also took July 14th and came up with $542\n     as the total for that particular day.\n\n          So I felt that between those two, substantiating a\n     $328 average of the prior year was within reason.\n\n     Mr. Chiate continued to lead Mr. Ozenne through their\n\npresentation of petitioner\u2019s theory of the case by asking Mr.\n\nOzenne if, in his opinion, the dinner checks, and cash register\n\f                              - 12 -\n\ntapes that he examined for periods outside the applicable period,\n\nestablished the double-ups theory proposed by petitioner, and Mr.\n\nOzenne agreed--absolutely.\n\n     Mr. Chiate further inquired of Mr. Ozenne:\n\n          Q. Okay. So in addition to the actual dinner\n     checks for the period immediately after the fiscal year\n     (the applicable period) did you determine that that was\n     also true for the months immediately preceding the year\n     in question?\n\n          A.   Yes.\n\n          Q. Okay. And did that support your opinion as to\n     the reasonableness of concluding that double-ups\n     account for the claimed deficiency of $120,000.\n\n          A. For the lion\u2019s share of it. As I said\n     earlier, the gift certificates and the comps would have\n     accounted for a very small part of that. And I think\n     the real proof of that is Ms. Groom came out and\n     finished, I believe in May, the first part of May of\n     1995, and the questions that arose as to the accuracy\n     of her schedule.\n\n          Well, shortly after those questions arose, the\n     bookkeeper at the restaurant instituted a procedure\n     whereby they reconciled the total of the two adding\n     machine tapes to the daily tickets on a daily basis.\n\n          Now that was not available in our year under\n     audit, or prior, because no one thought it was\n     important. [Emphasis added.]\n\n\n\nTestimony of Cecy Groom\n\n     Ms. Groom is a C.P.A. who has a bachelor\u2019s degree in\n\nbusiness administration.   She majored in accounting.   At the time\n\nof trial she was a business owner, managing and operating an\n\nInternational House of Pancakes (IHOP) and was also an affiliate\n\f                              - 13 -\n\nC.P.A. with William and Ribbs (W&R), a C.P.A. firm in Long Beach,\n\nCalifornia.   She was an independent contractor with W&R.   She had\n\nher own clients and shared clients with the firm.   She\n\nspecialized in restaurant clients because she had owned a number\n\nof national franchises such as El Pollo Loco, Sizzler and, at the\n\ntime of trial, IHOP.\n\n     She became involved with DAK, Inc. in March 1995, when Dr.\n\nShlens, the owner of the premises on which Moonshadows operated,\n\nretained her services to analyze the sales revenues.   Ms. Groom\n\nwas aware that, in 1991, Dr. Shlens entered into a lease with\n\nMarvin Kelson who was then the principal of DAK, Inc., to operate\n\nthe restaurant for a period of 15 years.   The lease provided that\n\npetitioner would pay a minimum rent of $120,000 per year.   The\n\nlease also required the payment of a percentage rent of 7-1/2\n\npercent of annual gross sales in excess of the minimum annual\n\nrental amount of $120,000.\n\n     Ms. Groom started her audit in April or May of 1995.   The\n\naudit was mainly conducted on the premises of the restaurant.\n\nBefore beginning her audit, Ms. Groom visited the restaurant as a\n\npatron on a number of occasions to observe the restaurant\u2019s\n\noperations.   When she first began her audit, Ms. Groom met with\n\nMarvin Kelson, the restaurant\u2019s accountant and bookkeeper who\n\nformerly owned the restaurant.   Mr. Kelson explained to Ms. Groom\n\nhow the restaurant recorded its daily sales.\n\f                              - 14 -\n\n     The basic source of information for recording daily sales\n\nwas the meal tickets.   The meal tickets were kept on a daily\n\nbasis in an envelope coded by the day of the week, and the daily\n\ncash register tapes from cash registers 1 and 2 were placed in\n\nthe envelope together with manual calculations prepared by Mr.\n\nKelson to compute net daily sales in the bar area (register 2).\n\nThose are some of the records that Ms. Groom analyzed to\n\ndetermine the restaurant\u2019s daily net sales.    Ms. Groom prepared\n\nvarious summaries of her findings.     Those summaries were received\n\nin evidence as Exhibits 3-J through 13-J.    For example, Exhibit\n\n8-J is a summary of Ms. Groom\u2019s analysis of Moonshadows\u2019s sales\n\nfor the month of November 1994.   For November 18, 1994, Ms. Groom\n\nreported that sales of $3,348 were recorded on the dining area\n\nregister tape (register 1), and sales of $926 were recorded on\n\nthe bar area register tape (register 2).\n\n     The source of the $3,348 reported as register 1 sales was\n\nthe register 1 tape given to Ms. Groom by the restaurant\u2019s\n\naccountant and bookkeeper, Mr. Kelson.    The source of the $926\n\nreported for register 2 sales was the register 2 tape and a\n\nreconciliation of the register 2 tape that was prepared by Mr.\n\nKelson.\n\n     There was introduced into evidence Exhibit 18-R, which\n\nconsisted of the above-mentioned register 1 and register 2 tapes,\n\f                              - 15 -\n\ntogether with a reconciliation of the register 2 tape prepared by\n\nMr. Kelson.\n\n     The reconciliation of the register 2 tape showed that Mr.\n\nKelson determined that the gross sales reported on the register 2\n\nbar tape was $1,580.90.   He then determined that the Code V (5)\n\ntransactions recorded on the tape totaled $628.65.    Code V\n\ntransactions are the bar sales recorded on the register 2 tape\n\nthat are carried over onto the register 1 tape in the dining\n\narea.   Mr. Kelson deducted the $628.65 from gross sales of\n\n$1,580.90, leaving a balance of $952.25.    This step in Mr.\n\nKelson\u2019s reconciliation process eliminated any double-ups between\n\nthe dining room and bar area tapes.    Mr. Kelson then deducted\n\n\u201ccomps\u201d of $12 and overrings of $14, resulting in net sales of\n\n$926.25, the amount entered by Ms. Groom as the net sales\n\nrecorded on register 2.   This procedure was followed by Ms. Groom\n\nduring her entire audit of petitioner\u2019s taxable year ended May\n\n31, 1995.\n\n     Petitioner contends that it carefully maintained adequate\n\nbooks and records for several years to determine its income.      The\n\nonly records the petitioner was unable to produce for examination\n\nare the records for the applicable period.    Petitioner, through\n\nMessrs. Chiate and Ozenne, then fabricated a scenario\n\norchestrated to prove that the determined unreported income of\n\n$120,371 can be explained away by showing that the entries on the\n\f                              - 16 -\n\nbar cash register tapes were duplicated on the dinner cash\n\nregister tapes, thus accounting for the \u201cdouble-ups\u201d theory upon\n\nwhich petitioner relied to invalidate respondent\u2019s determination\n\nof $120,371 of unreported income.\n\n     In following Mr. Chiate\u2019s leading questions, Mr. Ozenne\n\ntestified that by analyzing the restaurant\u2019s records from periods\n\nother than the applicable period (June 1994 through May 31, 1995)\n\nhe could prove that the \u201c$120,000\u201d unreported income could be\n\naccounted for by showing that there were \u201cdouble-ups\u201d on the bar\n\nand dinner cash register tapes.\n\n     Mr. Ozenne explained the basis for his double-ups theory as\n\nfollows:\n\n          Well, what I did, if you take the IRS\u2019s proposed\n     adjustment of $120,000 and you divide by 365 days,\n     because they were open every day except Christmas and\n     Thanksgiving, you get an average of $328. So our\n     contention is that approximately $328 worth of drinks\n     every day were added to tape two (2) and to tape one\n     (1) which are double counted.\n\n     Having computed the amount of $328 as the base figure needed\n\nto arrive at $120,000,3   Mr. Ozenne then incredibly explained how\n\nhe arrived at a $328 day double-up:\n\n          What we did initially is we took the day of July\n     2nd and we added up all the double counts on that one\n     and it came to $183. Because that was a small group of\n\n\n     3\n          To be more accurate, Mr. Ozenne should have divided\n$120,000 by 363 days because the restaurant was closed on\nChristmas and Thanksgiving Day. He would then have a base figure\nof $331 to work with, but the Court is confident the discrepancy\nwould not have slowed Mr. Ozenne down.\n\f                             - 17 -\n\n     tapes, it was probably a weekday that was slow for some\n     reason. We also took July 14th and came up with $542\n     as the total for that particular day.\n\n          So I felt that between these two, substantiating a\n     $328 average of the prior year was within reason.\n\n     As we said in Diaz v. Commissioner, 58 T.C. 560, 564\n\n(1972):\n\n     This case epitomizes the ultimate task of a trier of\n     the facts--the distillation of truth from falsehood\n     which is the daily grist of judicial life. We must be\n     careful to avoid making the Courtroom a haven for the\n     skillful liar or a quagmire in which the honest\n     litigant is swallowed up. Truth itself is never in\n     doubt, but it often has an elusive quality which makes\n     the search for it fraught with difficulty. That this\n     is so is clearly illustrated by the situation herein.\n     * * *\n\n     We closely observed Mr. Chiate and Mr. Ozenne at trial.    We\n\nfind the testimony of each of them to have been contrived and\n\nuntrustworthy, and we completely disregard it.\n\n     On the other hand, we found Ms. Groom to be a credible,\n\nforthcoming witness whose professionalism was evidenced by the\n\ndocumentation admitted at trial to credit her audit of petitioner\n\nfor the applicable period.\n\n     She consulted with the restaurant\u2019s accountant and\n\nbookkeeper, Mr. Kelson (the original owner of Moonshadows).    She\n\nreviewed the daily meal tickets, the daily cash register tapes\n\nfrom cash registers 1 (dining room) and 2 (bar), and, in\n\nparticular, the manual computations prepared by Mr. Kelson on a\n\ndaily basis to reconcile cash register tape l with cash register\n\f                              - 18 -\n\ntape 2.   As noted supra, the purpose of Mr. Kelson\u2019s\n\nreconciliations was to assure that, in determining net sales, no\n\nbar sales were duplicated on the dining room cash register tapes.\n\nMs. Groom clearly demonstrated that no double-ups were included\n\nin her summaries (Exhibits 3-J through 13-J) in which she\n\ndetermined petitioner\u2019s income for the taxable year ended May 31,\n\n1995.\n\n     Petitioner did not call Mr. Kelson as a witness.   He was\n\npetitioner\u2019s accountant and bookkeeper who prepared the daily\n\ncash register tape 2 (the bar) reconciliation that assured there\n\nwould be no double-ups on cash register tape 1 (the dining room).\n\nUnder Wichita Terminal Elevator Co. v. Commissioner, 6 T.C. 1158,\n\n1165 (1946), affd. 162 F.2d 513 (10th Cir. 1947), we infer that\n\nMr. Kelson\u2019s testimony, if offered at trial, would have clearly\n\ndisproved petitioner\u2019s \u201cdouble-ups\u201d theory.\n\n     Petitioner\u2019s \u201cdouble-ups\u201d theory is patently bogus, and we\n\nreject it.\n\n     Respondent determined that petitioner is liable for an\n\naccuracy-related penalty of $6,089.40 for failure to report\n\nincome in the amount of $120,371.\n\n     Section 6662(a) imposes a 20-percent penalty on the portion\n\nof an underpayment attributable to any one of various factors,\n\none of which is negligence or disregard of rules or regulations.\n\nSec. 6662(b)(1).   \u201cNegligence\u201d includes any failure to make a\n\f                                - 19 -\n\nreasonable attempt to comply with the provisions of the Internal\n\nRevenue Code, including any failure to keep adequate books and\n\nrecords or to substantiate items properly.    Sec. 6662(c); sec.\n\n1.6662-3(b)(1), Income Tax Regs.    Section 6664(c)(1) provides\n\nthat the penalty under section 6662(a) shall not apply to any\n\nportion of an underpayment if it is shown that there was\n\nreasonable cause for the taxpayer\u2019s position and that the\n\ntaxpayer acted in good faith with respect to that portion.      The\n\ndetermination of whether a taxpayer acted with reasonable cause\n\nand in good faith is made on a case by case basis, taking into\n\naccount all the pertinent facts and circumstances.    Sec. 1.6664-\n\n4(b)(1), Income Tax Regs.    The most important factor is the\n\nextent of the taxpayer\u2019s effort to assess his proper tax\n\nliability for the year.     Id.; Neely v. Commissioner, 85 T.C. 934,\n\n947 (1985).   We find that petitioner was negligent and lacked due\n\ncare in preparing its Federal income tax return for the year\n\nended May 31, 1995.   We are confident that petitioner was aware\n\nthat its accountant and bookkeeper, Mr. Kelson, on a daily basis,\n\nreconciled cash register tapes 1 and 2 to eliminate any \u201cdouble-\n\nups\u201d.   Respondent is sustained on this issue.\n\n     Reviewed and adopted as the report of the Small Tax Case\n\nDivision.\n\f                        - 20 -\n\nTo reflect the foregoing,\n\n                                  Decision will be entered\n\n                             for respondent.\n\f"
