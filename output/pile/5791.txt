In addition, the fuser member described herein can\nalso be used in a transfix apparatus in a solid ink jet printing machine.\n\n[0004] 2. Background\n\n[0005] In the electrophotographic printing process, a toner image can be\nfixed or fused upon a support (e.g., a paper sheet) using a fuser roller.\nConventional fusing technologies apply release agents/fuser oils to the\nfuser roller during the fusing operation, in order to maintain good\nrelease properties of the fuser roller. For example, oil fusing\ntechnologies have been used for all high speed products in the entry\nproduction and production color market.\n\n[0006] Extending oil-less fusing technologies to high speed printers, such\nas 100 pages per minute (ppm) or faster, while meeting a series of\nstringent system requirements such as image quality, parts cost,\nreliability, long component life, etc. remains technically challenging.\n\n[0007] While perfluoroalkoxy polymer resin (PFA) is currently used in many\ntopcoat formulations in fuser rollers and belts to yield excellent\nrelease, issues such as surface cracking, denting, and delamination limit\nthe lifetime of PFA rollers and belts. It would be desirable to find a\nmaterial combination for fuser rollers and belts that mitigates surface\ncracking, denting and delamination while providing excellent release. In\naddition, adhesion between the intermediate layers and outer layer can be\na problem when using a PFA outer layer. It would be desirable to find a\nmaterial combination that eliminates the need for adhesion or primer\nlayers.\n\nSUMMARY\n\n[0008] According to an embodiment, a fuser member is provided. The fuser\nmember includes a layer of a siloxyfluorocarbon networked polymer.\n\n[0009] According to another embodiment, there is disclosed a method for\nproducing a polymer comprising reacting in a solution of siloxane\nterminated fluorocarbons, and a solvent to form a networked\nsiloxyfluorocarbon. The siloxyfluorocarbon networked polymer has a\nfluorine content of between about 30 weight percent to about 70 weight\npercent.\n\n[0010] According to another embodiment there is provided a fuser member.\nThe fuser member includes a substrate and a resilient layer disposed on\nthe substrate. An adhesive layer comprising a networked\nsiloxyfluorocarbon polymer is disposed on the resilient layer. A release\nlayer comprising a fluoropolymer is disposed on the adhesive layer.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n[0011] The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute\na part of this specification, illustrate several embodiments of the\npresent teachings and together with the description, serve to explain the\nprinciples of the present teachings.\n\n[0012] FIG. 1 depicts an exemplary fusing member having a cylindrical\nsubstrate in accordance with the present teachings.\n\n[0013] FIG. 2 depicts an exemplary fusing member having a belt substrate\nin accordance with the present teachings.\n\n[0017] It should be noted that some details of the FIGS. have been\nsimplified and are drawn to facilitate understanding of the embodiments\nrather than to maintain strict structural accuracy, detail, and scale.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS\n\n[0018] Reference will now be made in detail to embodiments of the present\nteachings, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying\ndrawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used\nthroughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.\n\n[0019] In the following description, reference is made to the accompanying\ndrawings that form a part thereof, and in which is shown by way of\nillustration specific exemplary embodiments in which the present\nteachings may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient\ndetail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the present\nteachings and it is to be understood that other embodiments may be\nutilized and that changes may be made without departing from the scope of\nthe present teachings. The following description is, therefore, merely\nexemplary.\n\n[0020] Illustrations with respect to one or more implementations,\nalterations and/or modifications can be made to the illustrated examples\nwithout departing from the spirit and scope of the appended claims. In\naddition, while a particular feature may have been disclosed with respect\nto only one of several implementations, such feature may be combined with\none or more other features of the other implementations as may be desired\nand advantageous for any given or particular function. Furthermore, to\nthe extent that the terms \"including\", \"includes\", \"having\", \"has\",\n\"with\", or variants thereof are used in either the detailed description\nand the claims, such terms are intended to be inclusive in a manner\nsimilar to the term \"comprising.\" The term \"at least one of\" is used to\nmean one or more of the listed items can be selected.\n\n[0021] Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters setting\nforth the broad scope of embodiments are approximations, the numerical\nvalues set forth in the specific examples are reported as precisely as\npossible. Any numerical value, however, inherently contains certain\nerrors necessarily resulting from the standard deviation found in their\nrespective testing measurements. Moreover, all ranges disclosed herein\nare to be understood to encompass any and all sub-ranges subsumed\ntherein. For example, a range of \"less than 10\" can include any and all\nsub-ranges between (and including) the minimum value of zero and the\nmaximum value of 10, that is, any and all sub-ranges having a minimum\nvalue of equal to or greater than zero and a maximum value of equal to or\nless than 10, e.g., 1 to 5. In certain cases, the numerical values as\nstated for the parameter can take on negative values. In this case, the\nexample value of range stated as \"less than 10\" can assume negative\nvalues, e.g. -1, -2, -3, -10, -20, -30, etc.\n\n[0022] The fixing member can include a substrate having one or more\nfunctional layers formed thereon. The substrate can include, e.g., a\ncylinder or a belt. The one or more functional layers includes an\noutermost or top silicon textured surface having a surface wettability\nthat is hydrophobic and/or oleophobic; ultrahydrophobic and/or\nultraoleophobic; or superhydrophobic and/or superoleophobic by forming\ntextured features in the silicon. Such a fixing member can be used as an\noil-less fusing member for high speed, high quality electrophotographic\nprinting to ensure and maintain a good toner release from the fused toner\nimage on an image supporting material (e.g., a paper sheet), and further\nassist paper stripping. In another embodiment, the silicon textured\nsurface can provide an oil-free, such as wax-free, toner design for the\noil-less fixing process.\n\n[0023] In various embodiments, the fixing member can include, for example,\na substrate, with one or more functional layers formed thereon. The\nsubstrate can be formed in various shapes, e.g., a cylinder (e.g., a\ncylinder tube), a cylindrical drum, a belt, or a film, using suitable\nmaterials that are non-conductive or conductive depending on a specific\nconfiguration, for example, as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2.\n\n[0024] Specifically, FIG. 1 depicts exemplary a fixing or fusing member\n100 having a cylindrical substrate 110 and FIG. 2 depicts another\nexemplary fixing or fusing member 200 having a belt substrate 210 in\naccordance with the present teachings. It should be readily apparent to\none of ordinary skill in the art that the fixing or fusing member 100\ndepicted in FIG. 1 and the fixing or fusing member 200 depicted in FIG. 2\nrepresent generalized schematic illustrations and that other\nlayers/substrates can be added or existing layers/substrates can be\nremoved or modified.\n\n[0025] In FIG. 1 the exemplary fixing member 100 can be a fuser roller\nhaving a cylindrical substrate 110 with one or more functional layers 120\nand an outer layer 130 formed thereon. In various embodiments, the\ncylindrical substrate 110 can take the form of a cylindrical tube, e.g.,\nhaving a hollow structure including a heating lamp therein, or a solid\ncylindrical shaft. In FIG. 2, the exemplary fixing member 200 can include\na belt substrate 210 with one or more functional layers, e.g., 220 and an\nouter surface 230 formed thereon. The belt substrate 210 and the\ncylindrical substrate 110 can be formed from, for example, polymeric\nmaterials (e.g., polyimide, polyaramide, polyether ether ketone,\npolyetherimide, polyphthalamide, polyamide-imide, polyketone,\npolyphenylene sulfide, fluoropolyimides or fluoropolyurethanes), metal\nmaterials (e.g., aluminum or stainless steel) to maintain rigidity and\nstructural integrity as known to one of ordinary skill in the art.\n\n[0027] Examples of functional layers 120 and 220 also include\nfluoroelastomers. Fluoroelastomers are from the class of 1) copolymers of\ntwo of vinylidenefluoride, hexafluoropropylene, and tetrafluoroethylene;\n2) terpolymers of vinylidenefluoride, hexafluoropropylene, and\ntetrafluoroethylene; and 3) tetrapolymer's of vinylidenefluoride,\nhexafluoropropylene, tetrafluoroethylene, and cure site monomer.

The VITON GF\u00ae and VITON\nGH\u00ae have about 35 weight percent of vinylidenefluoride, about 34\nweight percent of hexafluoropropylene, and about 29 weight percent of\ntetrafluoroethylene, with about 2 weight percent cure site monomer.\n\n[0030] For a roller configuration, the thickness of the functional layer\ncan be from about 0.5 mm to about 10 mm, or from about 1 mm to about 8\nmm, or from about 2 mm to about 7 mm. For a belt configuration, the\nfunctional layer can be from about 25 microns up to about 2 mm, or from\n40 microns to about 1.5 mm, or from 50 microns to about 1 mm.\n\n[0031] An exemplary embodiment of a release layer 130 or 230 includes\nfluoropolymer particles. Fluoropolymer particles suitable for use in the\nformulation described herein include fluorine-containing polymers. These\npolymers include fluoropolymers comprising a monomeric repeat unit that\nis selected from the group consisting of vinylidene fluoride,\nhexafluoropropylene, tetrafluoroethylene, perfluoroalkylvinylether, and\nmixtures thereof. The fluoropolymers may include linear or branched\npolymers, and cross-linked fluoroelastomers. Examples of fluoropolymer\ninclude polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE); perfluoroalkoxy polymer resin\n(PFA); copolymer of tetrafluoroethylene (TFE) and hexafluoropropylene\n(HFP); copolymers of hexafluoropropylene (HFP) and vinylidene fluoride\n(VDF or VF2); terpolymers of tetrafluoroethylene (TFE), vinylidene\nfluoride (VDF), and hexafluoropropylene (HFP); and tetrapolymers of\ntetrafluoroethylene (TFE), vinylidene fluoride (VF2), and\nhexafluoropropylene (HFP), and mixtures thereof.

In various embodiments, other additives known\nto one of ordinary skill in the art can also be included to form the\ndisclosed composite materials.\n\n[0034] Optionally, any known and available suitable adhesive layer may be\npositioned between the outer layer or outer surface, the functional layer\nand the substrate. The adhesive layer can be coated on the substrate, or\non the outer layer, to a thickness of from about 2 nanometers to about\n10,000 nanometers, or from about 2 nanometers to about 1,000 nanometers,\nor from about 2 nanometers to about 5000 nanometers. The adhesive can be\ncoated by any suitable known technique, including spray coating or\nwiping.\n\n[0035] FIGS. 3A-4B and FIGS. 4A-4B depict exemplary fusing configurations\nfor the fusing process in accordance with the present teachings. It\nshould be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the\nfusing configurations 300A-B depicted in FIGS. 3A-3B and the fusing\nconfigurations 400A-B depicted in FIGS. 4A-4B represent generalized\nschematic illustrations and that other\nmembers/layers/substrates/configurations can be added or existing\nmembers/layers/substrates/configurations can be removed or modified.\nAlthough an electrophotographic printer is described herein, the\ndisclosed apparatus and method can be applied to other printing\ntechnologies. Examples include offset printing and inkjet and solid\ntransfix machines.\n\n[0036] FIGS. 3A-3B depict the fusing configurations 300A-B using a fuser\nroller shown in FIG. 1 in accordance with the present teachings. The\nconfigurations 300A-B can include a fuser roller 100 (i.e., 100 of FIG.\n1) that forms a fuser nip with a pressure applying mechanism 335, such as\na pressure roller in FIG. 3A or a pressure belt in FIG. 3B, for an image\nsupporting material 315. In various embodiments, the pressure applying\nmechanism 335 can be used in combination with a heat lamp 337 to provide\nboth the pressure and heat for the fusing process of the toner particles\non the image supporting material 315. In addition, the configurations\n300A-B can include one or more external heat roller 350 along with, e.g.,\na cleaning web 360, as shown in FIG. 3A and FIG. 3B.\n\n[0037] FIGS. 4A-4B depict fusing configurations 400A-B using a fuser belt\nshown in FIG. 2 in accordance with the present teachings. The\nconfigurations 400A-B can include a fuser belt 200 (i.e., 200 of FIG. 2)\nthat forms a fuser nip with a pressure applying mechanism 435, such as a\npressure roller in FIG. 4A or a pressure belt in FIG. 4B, for a media\nsubstrate 415. In various embodiments, the pressure applying mechanism\n435 can be used in a combination with a heat lamp to provide both the\npressure and heat for the fusing process of the toner particles on the\nmedia substrate 415. In addition, the configurations 400A-B can include a\nmechanical system 445 to move the fuser belt 200 and thus fusing the\ntoner particles and forming images on the media substrate 415. The\nmechanical system 445 can include one or more rollers 445a-c, which can\nalso be used as heat rollers when needed.\n\n[0038]FIG. 5 demonstrates a view of an embodiment of a transfix member 7\nwhich may be in the form of a belt, sheet, film, or like form. The\ntransfix member 7 is constructed similarly to the fuser belt 200\ndescribed above. The developed image 12 positioned on intermediate\ntransfer member 1 is brought into contact with and transferred to\ntransfix member 7 via rollers 4 and 8. Roller 4 and/or roller 8 may or\nmay not have heat associated therewith. Transfix member 7 proceeds in the\ndirection of arrow 13. The developed image is transferred and fused to a\ncopy substrate 9 as copy substrate 9 is advanced between rollers 10 and\n11. Rollers 10 and/or 11 may or may not have heat associated therewith.\n\n[0039] Disclosed herein is fuser member that includes a siloxyfluorocarbon\nnetworked polymer in any of the above described layers. The\nsiloxyfluorcarbon networked polymer is formed via sol-gel chemistry.\nSiloxyfluorocarbon monomers are crosslinked via sol-gel chemistry, where\nhydrolysis and condensation of alkoxide or hydroxide groups occurs and\nupon curing at elevated temperatures, produces a coating used on fusing\nsurfaces. The siloxyfluorocarbon networked polymer can be present in one\nor more of the intermediate layer, the outer layer, or the adhesive\nlayer. The siloxyfluorocarbon networked polymer can withstand high\ntemperature conditions without melting or degradation, is mechanically\nrobust under fusing conditions, and displays good release under fusing\nconditions. The siloxyfluorocarbon (SFC) networked polymer is well suited\nto serve as an adhesive layer for fuser rollers or belts. A SFC networked\npolymer layer binds together the silicone rubber and the fusing topcoat.\nUsing SFC as an adhesive layer decreases the occurrence of failure due to\ndelamination, and suppresses defects occurring during processing by\nforming a networked, reinforcing layer around the silicone rubber.\n\n[0040] Monofunctional, difunctional, or trifunctional silane end groups\nmay be used to prepare a siloxyfluorocarbon networked polymer.\nSiloxyfluorocarbon monomers are represented by the structure:\n\n##STR00001##\n\nwherein Cf is an aliphatic or aromatic fluorocarbon chain; L is a\nCnH2n linker group, where n is a number between 0 and about 10;\nand X1, X2, and X3 are reactive hydroxide functionalities,\nreactive alkoxide functionalities, unreactive aliphatic functionalities\nof about 1 carbon atom to about 10 carbon atoms, unreactive aromatic\nfunctionalities of about 1 carbon atom to 10 carbon atoms.\n\n[0041] In addition to the monomers listed above, the siloxyfluorocarbon\nnetworked polymer can be prepared using monomers having the following\nstructure:\n\n##STR00002##\n\nwherein Cf represents a fluorocarbon chain, which may be aliphatic,\naromatic, or contain mixtures of aliphatic or aromatic fluorocarbon\nchains; L is a CnH2n linker group, where n is a number between\n0 and about 10 (most likely 0 to 2); X1, X2, and X3 may be\nreactive hydroxide or alkoxide functionalities, or unreactive\nfunctionalities (aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons).\n\n[0042] In addition to the monomers listed above, the siloxyfluorocarbon\nnetworked polymer can be prepared using monomers that include\nnon-fluorinated silane monomers selected from the group consisting of\nsilicon tetraalkoxide and branched pentasilylchloride. The silicon\ntetraalkoxide and branched pentasilylchloride are represented by the\nrespective structures;\n\n##STR00003##\n\n[0043] The siloxyfluorocarbon networked polymer comprises a fluorine\ncontent of between about 30 weight percent to about 70 weight percent or\nfrom about 40 weight percent to about 70 weight percent or from about 50\nweight percent to about 70 weight percent. The silicon content, by\nweight, in the siloxyfluorocarbon networked polymer is from about 1\nweight percent silicon to about 20 weight percent silicon, or from about\n1.5 weight percent silicon to about 15 weight percent silicon or from\nabout 2 weight percent silicon to about 10 weight percent silicon.\n\n[0044] The monomers are networked together so that all monomers are\nmolecularly bonded together in the cured coating via silicon oxide\n(Si--O--Si) linkages. Therefore, a molecular weight can not be given for\nthe siloxyfluorocarbon networked polymer because the coating is\ncrosslinked into one system.\n\n[0045] Solvents used for sol gel processing of siloxyfluorocarbon\nprecursors and coating of layers include organic hydrocarbon solvents,\nand fluorinated solvents. Alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, and\nisopropanol are typically used to promote sol gel reactions in solution.\nFurther examples of solvents include ketones such as methyl ethyl ketone,\nand methyl isobutyl ketone. Mixtures of solvents may be used. The solvent\nsystem included the addition of a small portion of water, such as from\nabout 1 molar equivalent to 10 molar equivalents of water compared to\nsiloxyfluorocarbon precursors or the siloxane terminated fluorocarbons,\nor from about 2 molar equivalents to about 4 molar equivalents of water.\n\n[0046] Upon the addition of water to the solution of sol gel precursors,\nalkoxy groups react with water, and condense to form agglomerates that\nare partially networked, and are referred to as a sol. Upon coating of\nthe partially networked sol onto a substrate, a gel is formed upon\ndrying, and with subsequent heat treatment, the fully networked SFC\ncoating (siloxyfluorocarbon networked polymer) is formed on the substrate\nsurface (fuser substrate).\n\n[0047] A siloxyfluorocarbon networked polymer does not dissolve when\nexposed to solvents (such as ketones, chlorinated solvents, ethers etc.)\nand does not degrade at temperatures up to 350\u00b0 C., and is stable\nat higher temperatures, depending on the system. The siloxyfluorocrbon\nnetworked polymer exhibits good release when exposed to toner or other\ncontaminants, so that toner and other printing-related materials do not\nadhere to the fusing member.\n\n[0048] Ceramic materials are well-known for their strength and durability;\nhowever, they tend to be non-elastic and brittle. Therefore, ceramics\nalone are not ideal for use as a fusing material. The use of metal\nalkoxide sol-gel components allows the chemical incorporation of ceramic\ndomains into a hybrid system. It is desirable to couple sol-gel\ncomponents with fluorocarbon chains both to introduce flexibility into\nthe system, as well as to keep the fluorination content high for good\nrelease.\n\n[0049] In an embodiment, one can use metal alkoxide (M=Si, Al, Ti etc.)\nfunctionalities as cross-linking components between fluorocarbon chains.\nFor cross-linking to occur efficiently throughout the composite,\nbifunctional fluorocarbon chains are used. Mono-functional fluorocarbon\nchains can also be added to enrich fluorination content.\nCF3-terminated chains align at the fusing surface to reduce surface\nenergy and improve release.\n\n[0050] Examples of precursors that may be used to form a composite system\ninclude silicon tetraalkoxide and siloxane-terminated fluorocarbon chains\nand are shown below. Siloxane-based sol-gel precursors are commercially\navailable. The addition of a silicon tetraalkoxide (such as a silicon\ntetraalkoxide, below) introduces extra cross-linking and robustness to\nthe material, but is not necessary to form the sol-gel/fluorocarbon\ncomposite system.\n\n##STR00004##\n\n[0051] Fluorocarbon chains include readily available dialkene precursors\nwhich can then be converted to silanes via hydrosilation (Reaction 1).\nMonofunctional fluorinated siloxane chains are commercially available as\nmethyl or ethyl siloxanes, or could be converted from chlorosilane or\ndialkene precursors.\n\n##STR00005##\n\n[0052] Shown below are some fluorinated and siloxane precursors that are\ncommercially available. Fluorocarbon and siloxane materials are available\nfrom a variety of vendors including Gelest, Synquest, Apollo Scientific,\nFluorochem, TCI America, Anachemica, Lancaster Synthesis Inc., and\nPolysciences Inc.\n\n##STR00006##\n\n[0053] A representation of an example of a crosslinked composite system\nincorporating both monofunctional and difunctional fluorinated siloxane\nchains is shown in Structure 1. In this example, mechanical properties\nand fluorination content can be modified by adjustment of the ratio of\nmono- to difunctional precursors.\n\n##STR00007##\n\n[0054] Organic-inorganic hybrid materials have been prepared for flexible\noptical waveguide applications using a trifunctional siloxane group, and\nfluorinated bis-phenol-A, described in J. Mater. Chem. 2008, 18, 579-585.\nThe resulting materials were reported to be hard, yet flexible, and\ncrack-free. Hybrid materials of this type are often cited for optical\nwaveguide applications due to desirable refractive index properties of\nfluorinated materials combined with the mechanical strength of ceramics.\nHowever, these materials are not suitable for fuser applications where\nmechanical strength, flexibility and low surface energy are required.\n\n[0057] In a flow coating process, one pass of the SFC topcoat layer\nsolution was added to a bare Olympia roller and allowed to air-dry. Heat\ntreatment was carried out to 218\u00b0 C. to ensure networking of the\ntopcoat layer,\n\n[0058] The outer SFC topcoat could not be scraped away with a spatula or\npeeled from the surface of the silicone rubber. In comparison, a PFA\ntopcoat of an Olympia control roller with primer can be peeled from the\nsilicone substrate. In addition, pressing with a spatula or a hard tip\ndid not result in a compressed area to the extent that is observed for a\nPFA topcoat, and simulates surface damage that may occur during handling.\nFusing studies carried out with the SFC topcoat show that toner release\noccurs with wax-containing toner and without requiring the aid of an oil\nbarrier between the topcoat layer and toner/paper surface.\n\n[0059] A proportion of siloxy functionalities are bonded within the\nsiloxyfluorocarbon networked polymer and can be additionally bonded to\nother fusing layer to the extent to allow for release with toner, and\nremaining siloxy functionalities are present to a small extent that does\nnot result in surface contamination.\n\n[0060] Fusing measures such as cold offset temperature and hot offset\ntemperature are influenced by the fluorocarbon chain length and the\nfluorine content of the siloxyfluorocarbon topcoat. Hot offset\ntemperature is increased with increasing n of (CF2)n\nfluorocarbon chain incorporated into the SFC networked polymer.\n\n[0061] A coating of perfluoroalkoxy polymer resin (PFA) with 10 weight\npercent of siloxyfluorocarbon networked polymer was applied over a primer\nlayer composed of siloxyfluorocarbon networked polymer. The structure of\nthe disiloxyperfluorohexane (SFC) is shown below.\n\n[0063] In a flow coating process, one pass of the primer layer solution\nwas added to a bare Olympia roller and allowed to air-dry. Immediately\nfollowing, 4 successive passes of PFA topcoat dispersion were applied to\nthe surface with 5 minutes between passes. Heat treatment was carried out\nto 218\u00b0 C. to ensure networking of the primer layer, followed by\nheat treated in a 350\u00b0 C. oven for 15 minute to cure the PFA\ntopcoat.\n\n[0064] The outer PFA coating could not be scraped away with a spatula or\npeeled from the surface of the silicone rubber. In comparison, the PFA\ntopcoat of an Olympia control roller with primer can be peeled from the\nsilicone substrate. Cracking of the outer PFA topcoat was not observed.\n\n[0065] The PFA with 10 weight percent SFC topcoat would not adhere as\nstrongly to the silicone rubber without the addition of the SFC primer\nlayer. It has been demonstrated that a composite coating of 25 weight\npercent SFC/75 weight percent PFA can be peeled away from a silicone\nsubstrate by force. The addition of the SFC primer layer with PFA\ncontaining only 10 weight percent SFC produced a strongly bound topcoat.\n\n[0066] In order to enhance adhesion to the primer layer, a small amount of\nSFC networked polymer may be added to the topcoat formulation. SFC may be\nadded in the range of about 0.1 weight percent to about 10 weight\npercent, or from about 1 weight percent to about 5 weight percent, or\nabout 2 weight percent to about 4 weight percent. The surface energy of\nflow-coated SFC (disiloxyperfluorohexane), shown in Table 1, is\ncomparable to that of Viton and should not affect toner release in small\namounts.\n\n[0067] Application of the adhesive layer may be carried out by\nspray-coating, flow-coating, or by other coating methods. Typically, a\nsolution of SFC material in ethanol or another alcohol or mixture\ncontaining alcohol can be prepared with the addition of 3-4 equivalents\nof water and a catalytic amount of acid or base to initiate networking.\nFollowing air-drying, the topcoat layer can be applied. The SFC primer\nlayer can fully network and adhere to both silicone and the topcoat layer\nwith heat treatment.\n\n[0068] It will be appreciated that variants of the above-disclosed and\nother features and functions or alternatives thereof may be combined into\nother different systems or applications.
