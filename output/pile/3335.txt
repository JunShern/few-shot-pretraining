As with any promotional film the client wants the product to be bigger and better than reality. We were happy to comply and most of the footage represents reality, until the end scene where the couple are looking out over the river. This is an effect and in reality the river can\u2019t even be seen from the apartment. We weren\u2019t too bothered by this since the first time a potential buyer looks out the window they will realize it\u2019s quite a different story."
