    "text": "A man who apparently has a passionate love for nature's most perfect food crashed his car multiple times into a Connecticut gas station this week in order to get a single solitary banana and leisurely eat it. As anyone with an internet connection circa 2002 knows, a man's got to do what a man's got to do when it's peanut butter jelly time.\n\nPolice tell The Hartford Courant that the incident happened at the Citgo Gas Station in Newington around 1:45 a.m. Wednesday when the store was closed. They say the suspect repeatedly rammed his station wagon into the building, breaking through the glass. Then the driver got out, took a banana off a shelf, peeled it and ate it. \"He didn't appear to be in any rush,\" said Sgt. Christopher J. Perry.\n\nNo other items were stolen from the store during the break-in. Police are still searching for the banana bandit. Below, you can see an exclusive video of the suspect in action:"
