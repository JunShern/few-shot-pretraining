    "text": "But you can also start with reading the introduction to the pre-trip report which follows now and which will tell you who is writing this trip report!!\n\nWe are two sisters from Germany who are planning a trip to WDW together for October 2011. Let's start with some introductions and the story of the trip (and hence the title of this PTR).\n\nIntroductions:\n\nFlossbolna: Magdalene in real life, 39 years old, the bigger Disney fan of the two of us. I am the one with the blue t-shirt in the pictures. I have been to WDW for the first time in 2004 and then annually since 2007. Last fall I realized that I really like those annual trips and that it would make sense for me to actually become a member of the Disney Vacation Club. Since November 2010 I am now the proud owner of DVC points at the Boardwalk Villas.\n\nnodnol: Katharina in real life, 36 years old, and the one who is very happy to be taken along. I have been to WDW only once in 2010. This was a trip where I didn\u0092t really know what to expect and therefore didn\u0092t always know what I wanted. I\u0092m looking forward to some visit my favorite places again as well as experiencing new things.\n\nKatharina and I share quite a lot of \u0084Disney history\u0093. Our first visit to a Disney park was in 1992: two days at Disneyland when we visited our aunt in California. Since then we have been to Disneyland Paris a few times together. And I was very excited when I could take Katharina along to WDW for her first trip there in January 2010. The trip was so great that we really hoped to get the opportunity for another sisters' trip! And here we are planning it...\n\nAs you can see above, we will both be contributing to this PTR, Magdalene writes in Royal Blue and Katharina in Dark Red.\n\nIn case your are interested to read about our previous trip, the pre-trip report can be found here and the trip-report is here.\n\nThe Story of the Trip:\n\nA few years ago I realized that the Magic Kingdom opened in 1971 just a few weeks before I was born. I really liked that bit of trivia. And I had the idea that it would be a lot of fun to celebrate my 40th birthday together with the Magic Kingdom. What other place could make you feel so young when you are starting to belong to the \u0084old people\u0093? So for a few years I have been telling everyone that I will spend November 6, 2011 at Walt Disney World.\n\nThen, after our trip in January 2010, Katharina and I thought it would be wonderful if she could be there to celebrate with me and we thought that Katharina might join me for part of the trip (not spending all her vacation days on me, but keeping enough for a nice vacation with her DH, we call him Remy on the Disboards) in November 2011. And then it turned out that while Katharina would be able to afford to come along (with a little help from our parents), her work suddenly had two huge projects in the first two weeks of November which would make it very difficult to take time off around my birthday. But October would work for her.\n\nIt really wasn't much of a question: Birthdays can be celebrated a month early and a trip with my sister is so many times better than a trip without her, that we changed our dates to October 11-22, 2011. It will still be my 40th birthday present to myself and I intend to celebrate my birthday, but there won't be any actual birthday during our trip... Oh, and we miss the real WDW birthday as well, which is October 1. But I am sure we will make up for that anyway!!\n\nWhat to expect from this TR?\n\nWe had a lot of fun with our PTR for the last trip and are looking forward to share all kind of planning issues with you \u0096 from air travel, ADRs, bags and shoes to possible special excursions.\n\nBut we will also add a few bonus updates into the mix... Those will most likely start with some reports about our trip to Disneyland Paris. We are leaving tomorrow! But we will also include some bits and pieces about life in Germany since those seemed to find some interest in the previous reports.\n\nHi, I turn 40 just before you and had played with the idea of having my birthday at WDW butcould not wait and went in Feb instead. I will have to satisfy myself by following you!Have a great time in Paris!!\n\nI'm in!!! WOOT WOOT...love October Trips!! I celebrate my bday on October 2nd and actually I am a day younger than EPCOT, so I'm hoping to celebrate my 30th bday with EPCOT in 2012 along with my 10th wedding anniversary!!\n\nI'm here too!!!\nI can't wait to meet you in October!!! I almost forgot to tell you that I called Member Services and was able to change to Beach Club.
