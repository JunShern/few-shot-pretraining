    "text": "This review may contain spoilers for DC continuity. Skip To The Verdict? \u00bb\n\nMany of you will have heard of the Secret Six but until a couple of years ago no such super-team existed.\n\nIn fact, several members of it didn\u2019t exist either, or at least not in their current guises.\n\nCatman, Rag Doll, Parademon and Scandal Savage are the more unknown characters who, along with Deadshot and Cheshire, make up the Secret Six.\n\nThe miniseries itself was a direct tie-in with the 2005 DC Universe-changing title Infinite Crisis, one of 6 or so major tie-in/precursor titles for the event.\n\nOut of all these tie-ins, Villains United is one of the few tie-ins that can be enjoyed separately from the main story.\n\nThis trade has more links to the previous mini-crisis, Identity Crisis, than most of the other tie-ins, which for me is pretty nice as I like books that don\u2019t just forget what has happened.\n\nFollowing the fallout of Identity Crisis and the shock revelation of what the Justice League did to Dr. Light, the super-villain community is allying up to make themselves stronger against the so called heroes; they are forming \u201cThe Society\u201c.\n\nWe join them in the full swing of their recruitment drive which features some fan favourite villains starting off with Mr. Freeze and ending with Sabbac and Catman. They all swiftly say yes, in a similar fashion to LOTR\u2019s \u201cYou have my sword\u201d followed by \u201cAnd my \u2026\u201d (replace \u2026 with axe/bow/freeze-ray). All except Catman that is.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he sternly responds to Talia al Ghul and Dr. Psycho, which goes down like a lead balloon. Being turned down by Catman of all people does even more to infuriate the society\u2019s \u201crecruitment officers.\u201d He isn\u2019t even a B-list villain.\n\nWith the Society wanting to become a major force to be reckoned with, this isn\u2019t the kind of underground press they wanted. The majority of the Society want to kill Catman to make an example of him, but Luthor steps in, as devious as ever, suggesting that there is a better way to make an example out of him.\n\nThe plot then skips to the other 5 members of the Secret Six, who are joined by the Fiddler out on a mission in the Amazon. It becomes apparent that they are acting as a force against the Society on behalf of some faceless employer, Mockingbird.\n\nDuring the course of this mission Fiddler [Spoiler: is tragically killed], meaning they are currently one member shy of being the Secret Six. Obviously they have to replace him. It would be bad juju to not have the right number of members for a phonetically pleasing team name. This is where Catman comes in.\n\nThe plot then flows forward in a mostly linear fashion. It is not really a spoiler to find out that part of Luthor\u2019s plans involved humiliating Blake by killing not just him but the entire Secret Six. So now we get to enjoy a full-on super-villain-on-super-villain (ultra-hyphenated) war.\n\nThe writer for this series is Gail Simone, best known before this series for her work on the popular Birds of Prey ongoing.\n\nI am happy to report that her writing in this volume is of the same high standard I had come to expect from her previous work. In fact, this team shows off her ability to write characters from scratch that manage to hold my attention better than she ever did before.\n\nThe Secret Six also allow her to show of the darker side of her humour more than ever, which is the central force behind my affection for this team.\n\nThe interaction involving Rag Doll and Parademon is prime example of this, as is almost anything Rag Doll says. That Rag Doll is one sick character but you cannot help loving him. After all, he is so well spoken and so polite, even when someone has kneed him in the groin.\n\nOne of the most fun things about this volume is how it spans the whole range of super-villains in the DCU. There are a ton of different characters popping up everywhere!\n\nSo many, in fact, that there is a guide in the back that acts a visual role call of who was in the book (by my count, over 70 different villains!).\n\nThe downside of the title being a tie-in is that some of the plot is aimed at having some affect on the Crisis, meaning sometimes the plot seems slightly unnatural.\n\nThe artwork is primarily drawn by Dale Eaglesham (Green Lantern Volume 3) which is up to a decent standard. It isn\u2019t artwork that you will wow you, but neither would you find it insulting to your retinas.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, there is a whole array of different characters in this volume and I can imagine Dale had a great time getting to draw so many. As I am sure Val Semeiks (Lobo) did when he covered for Dale in issue 3. His pencils are a little bit better than the main artist\u2019s.\n\nI would also like to point out another neat feature of this collected edition. The first few pages of the book compromise of a summary of events leading up to this trade, taken from all over the DCU. It acts as a very good introduction to the book and a check-in to make sure you know anything needed to enjoy the story.\n\nThis is a feature I would like to see more in books featuring new teams. For example, something in the beginning of the new Batgirl could have had a brief run-down of Stephanie Brown\u2019s life, Cassandra Cain\u2019s career in the cowl, and the other main events in the Batverse that come up in the trade. Without it, the story might be a little hard to follow for new comic readers.\n\nI have attempted to keep this review relatively vague so as not to spoil anything from Identity Crisis or Infinite Crisis. These are two titles that I would 100% suggest reading before you stumble across a spoiler somewhere, if you haven\u2019t already.\n\nSo what of Countdown To Infinite Crisis: Villains United?\n\nDo the new characters hold their own? Does the team fit together and work? Is there enough here that it deserves its own ongoing? Should that title be successful? Yes, yes, yes and hell yes.\n\nOn the whole this is a very good book with only the average art and slightly forced links to Infinite Crisis letting it down. This is the start of one of the best additions to the DC Universe in a long time.\n\nOr let me put it this put it this way: out of 3 direct titles that came out of Infinite Crisis, Secret Six is the only one still going with no signs of stopping. And it all started here.\n\nVerdict:\n\n4 out of 5.\n\nA solid start to a new team that only grows stronger with each trade.\n\nThe trade itself is what an example of how modern collections should be put together and adds thoroughly to the enjoyment factor.\n\nEssential Continuity:\n\nNot overly essential for Infinite Crisis. Small ties to Identity Crisis.\n\nEntirely essential for the Secret Six.\n\nRead first:\n\nSurprisingly, nothing is essential to read before hand. The collected edition has a rare and really useful 8 page segment at the beginning of the trade detailing everything you need to know.\n\nYou would be missing out if you haven\u2019t read the main Identity Crisis trade, however.\n\nI would say it would be wise to also read Countdown to Infinite Crisis: The OMAC Project if you intend to read this and the main Infinite Crisis collection.\n\nRead next:\n\nI would suggest reading the back up story featured in Infinite Crisis: Companion, and from there move onto the limited series collected in Secret Six: Six Degrees of Separation. Chris just posted a review of that book.\n\n\n\nAfter that, just follow along the Secret Six Trade Reading Order.\n\nAnd despite having utterly nothing to do with the DCU, I would heartily recommend Enid Blyton\u2019s similarly named classic Secret Seven books.\n\n\u00ab Back to the top?"
