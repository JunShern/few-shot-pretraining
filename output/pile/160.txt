Improving the Rapid Software Testing methodology and training. I am going through an interesting transformation with it. I feel like I am nearing the top of a mountain, and soon I will be able to see down the other side. Not yet, though. Not quite yet. The grand book, to which my career has been building, will have to wait, as will the big blog posts.\n\nThe most up-to-date material and ideas I put into my classes and talks. I try it out on students who come to me over Skype.\n\nI explore better ways of testing. But the real focus of my work\u2013 my passion\u2013 is to clearly understand and precisely explain the processes of deep testing as I and the best testers I know already do it. That knowledge is largely tacit, but we find ways to illuminate it and methods to help people grow it. To some degree I can make it explicit, and the parts I can\u2019t make explicit I can still make relatable.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, here are some of the things I\u2019ve been working on:\n\nExploratory processes are not merely a form of search, they nearly always processes of personal transformation.\n\nThe Bootstrap Approach: Begin in confusion; end in precision.\n\nThe mentalities of a tester are much more important than the techniques of testing.\n\nThe Test Management Lens: a heuristic for getting clear on the status of testing.\n\nIntegrated view of regression testing that wraps up all the common ideas about it."
