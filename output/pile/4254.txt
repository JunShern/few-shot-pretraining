    "text": "Livestock\n\nYou will not start out your farm life with a barn to hold livestock animals. To\nstart raising livestock you'll need to hire Gannon to build a Barn, which costs\n200 Lumber and 12,000 G (27,000 G combined). There is only 1 animal Barn available, but you\ncan increase its size. The original small size can hold up to 4 Feeder bins, the\nmedium can hold 8, and the large barn can fit up to 12 Feeders. Each Feeder bin\ncan accommodate one cow or sheep.\n\nCows and sheep share the same barn. You can have any combination of the two\ntypes of animals as long as you have enough Feeder bins.\n\nWhen you receive a baby cow or baby sheep, it will only grow if you feed it every day.\nIf you don't feed it, then it will take longer to mature. Normally, a cow will take 18 days to mature\nand a sheep will take 16 days to mature. If you forget to feed it for a day, or can't due to\na storm, then that will add an extra day to its growing time.\n\nCows and Jersey Cows\n\nAfter you build your livestock barn, Mirabelle will visit and give you a free, baby\nnormal cow. If you want more normal cows, you can purchase them from her shop for\n5000 G each.\n\nTo collect milk from a cow, you need to buy a Milker from Mirabelle's shop. The Milker's price\nwill vary depending on how many Wonderful slots it has\non it (1 slot is 1000 G, 2 slots is 2000 G, etc.). Every day you can milk you normal, black-spotted\nadult Cow to receive a bottle of Milk. The more hearts your cow has, the higher quality of milk\nyou'll receive.\n\nYou will unlock the Jersey Cow once you have shipped an S-Rank milk from a\nnormal cow. The day after you ship the S-Rank Milk, Mirabelle will have baby Jersey Cows for\n15,000 G each. Jersey Cows take just as long as normal Cows to mature, but they produce\nmilk every 3 days instead of every day. Jersey Milk sells for more profit than normal Milk.\n\nThe milk you receive from cows can be converted into several different items via the maker machines:\n\nItem\n\nRecovery\n\nProfit\n\nMilk\n\n+4 STA+1 FUL\n\nAvg. 192 G to shipS-Rank max 270 G to ship60 G to Chen\n\nYogurt\n\n+4 STA+4 FUL\n\nAvg. 288 G to shipS-Rank max 405 G to ship90 G to Chen\n\nButter\n\n+1 STA+1 FUL\n\nAvg. 386 G to shipS-Rank max 540 G to ship120 G to Chen\n\nCheese\n\n+6 STA+4 FUL\n\nAvg. 578 to shipS-Rank max 810 G to ship180 G to Chen\n\nItem\n\nRecovery\n\nProfit\n\nJersey Milk\n\n+4 STA+1 FUL\n\nAvg. 675 G to shipS-Rank max 945 G to ship60 G to Chen\n\nSuperb Yogurt\n\n+4 STA+4 FUL\n\nAvg. 1013 G to shipS-Rank max 1417 G to ship90 G to Chen\n\nSuperb Butter\n\n+1 STA+1 FUL\n\nAvg. 1350 G to shipS-Rank max 1890 G to ship120 G to Chen\n\nSuperb Cheese\n\n+6 STA+4 FUL\n\nAvg. 2026 to shipS-Rank max 2835 G to ship180 G to Chen\n\nIf you want to birth cows on your farm, buy the Cow Miracle Potion from Mirabelle for 3500\nG. The same potion will work on a normal or Jersey Cow. You also need to have an available\nBirthing Pen, and the cow must be an adult. Use the Cow Miracle Potion on the cow you want to\nimpregnate, and then remember to put Fodder in the Birthing Pen's Feeder every day inside of the barn.\nAfter 21 days, the baby cow will be born. The new cow will have half the number of hearts its mother\nhad. It will take 18 days for the baby cow to mature into an adult cow.\n\nCows have a life span of about 6 years.\n\nSheep and Suffolk Sheep\n\nYou don't need to do anything special to unlock normal Sheep. As soon as Gannon finishes building your\nBarn, Mirabelle will have Sheep for 4000 G each. You will also need to buy the Clippers from her store\nfor 1000 G per available Wonderful Slot.\n\nNormal, adult Sheep can have their Wool clipped every 3 days. The more hearts the Sheep has, the\nbetter the Wool that it produces.\n\nMirabelle will also have the Suffolk Sheep for sale after you ship your first S-Rank\nWool. Each Suffolk Sheep costs 12,000 G! The pink Suffolk Sheep can have their wool clipped every\n6 days, but it sells for much higher than normal Wool.\n\nYou can convert wool into yarn with the Yarn Maker Machine:\n\nName\n\nProfit\n\nWool\n\nAvg. 772 G to shipS-Rank max 1080 G to ship240 G to Chen\n\nYarn\n\nAvg. 2412 G to shipS-Rank max 3375 G to ship1000 G to Chen\n\nName\n\nProfit\n\nSuffolk Wool\n\nAvg. 1930 G to shipS-Rank max 2700 G to ship240 G to Chen\n\nSuperb Yarn\n\nAvg. 6032 G to shipS-Rank max 8437 G to ship1000 G to Chen\n\nHaving Sheep born on your farm is similar to the method used for Cows, but the adult Sheep must\nhave all of its wool intact before the Sheep Miracle Potion can be used on it. The Sheep potion is\nat Mirabelle's shop for 3000 G each. After 16 days, the baby Sheep will be born with half of the\nhearts that the mother Sheep had. Another 16 days later and the child will be an adult Sheep."
