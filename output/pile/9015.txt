Take a look at what Time to Climb discovered on our trip to West Virginia!\n\nWest Virginia is home to the Monongahela National Forest which has some of the most stunning rock formations and wilderness in the state. This mountainous national forest contains the 100,000 + acre Spruce Knob-Seneca Rocks National Recreation Area. Established by the US Forest Service in 1965, it is the first of its kind to act as more than a preservation. The Spruce Knob-Seneca Rocks National Recreation area highlights outdoor activities and is used for research. The open space also provides support for the surrounding communities by leasing sections to farmers and cattle herders. This collaboration with the local community has helped foster and maintain the area\u2019s natural beauty & rural culture that has existed for hundreds of years.\n\nSeneca Rocks:\n\nLocated in the self-proclaimed town of Seneca Rocks, this massive \u201cFin\u201d ridge-line rises 900 feet above the Seneca creek and the town below. The rock is composed of Tuscarora quartzite with exposed cliffs that are roughly 300 ft in height. Seneca Rocks has 2 peaks \u2013 North Peak & South Peak (the tallest) \u2013 which are separated by a distinct notch. South Peak is also known as a \u201cTrue Peak,\u201d meaning it\u2019s summit is only accessible by technical rock climbing. It is the only one of its kind found on the east coast of the United States.\n\nCan you spot the climbers?\n\nSeneca Rocks has a long history of world-class rock climbing. The first recorded ascent of the rocks was made by a team of 3 climbers in 1939 and included Paul Bradt, Don Hubbard, & Sam Moore. The team was surprised to find an engraving of \u201cD.B. September 16, 1908\u201d at the top of the rocks, which was believed to be left by a surveyor who was working in the area.\n\nDuring World War II, these very rocks were used as a training ground for the US Army\u2019s 10th Mountain Division in preparation for the invasions made in the mountains of Italy. The rock formation is home to hundreds of trad climbing routes, from single pitch slab to multi-pitch cracks. The routes range anywhere from 5.0 to 5.13 in difficulty.\n\nSpruce Knob:\n\nStanding at 4,863 ft in height, this peak is the highest point of West Virginia (and includes the the Allegheny Mountains and the Appalachian Plateaus). Spruce Knob\u2019s prominence of 2,781 ft offers absolutely stunning views of the surrounding mountains. The summit has a distinct alpine feel and is covered in boulder/rock outcroppings with a dense spruce forest, Krummholz formation and the stunting of exposed trees. Such formations are not usually found in the the southern Appalachian range and are more common in the north woods of New England and Canada.\n\nThere is an abundance of wildlife at the top of Spruce Knob, including white tail deer, black bear, red squirrels and our friend (pictured above) the Appalachian cottontail rabbit who likes to hang out near the observation tower found at the summit.\n\nThe summit of Spruce Knob is accessible by driving. The road from the Gateway Restaurant (near the park entrance) to the summit parking lot is about 11-12 miles long. It\u2019s a bit narrow and has some very sharp turns, so take your time driving through the park. When you reach the top, there is a trail around the summit that is half a mile long. It\u2019s also wheel chair accessible! Upon reaching the far end of the trail (before looping back), you\u2019ll notice 180-degree panorama views that allow you to look out from both sides of the ridge-line.\n\nThe loop back takes you into the woods, which offers shade and protection from the often high winds that accompany the exposed areas of the summit. Small bushes and thick moss adorn the forest floor, giving a mystical feel to your hike through the spruce forest.\n\nCatching the sunset at Spruce Knob is a must if you are in the area. The vibrant colors that wash across the sky and pitch over the mountaintops is simply majestic. The observation tower allows you to get above the spruce trees and experience a unique 360-degree view of the surrounding mountains & valleys. If you are a photographer the \u201cGolden & Blue Hours\u201d here are phenomenal due to the prominence and isolation of the mountain.\n\nTo learn More about Seneca Rocks & Spruce Knob check out the following links:\n\nSpruce Knob and Seneca Rocks National Recreational Area\n\nClimbing Routes at Seneca Rocks\n\nSpruce Knob\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you like this article & want to support Time to Climb?\n\nShare With a Friend:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n25\n\n\n\n\n\n129 Shares\n\nCheck out GearTrade.com Free to sign up, Buy or Sell your outdoor gear and they give us a few bucks when you do!"
