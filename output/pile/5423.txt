    "text": "Q:\n\nMapkit, how to detect annotations have loaded\n\nI want the annotations callout to popup when the pin has finished it's drop animation.  Currently I am able to simulate it with the following method:\n- (void)showCallOut {\n    [myMapView selectAnnotation:[myMapView.annotations objectAtIndex:0] animated:YES];\n}\n\nIn my viewDidLoad is where my annotation is created\n    [myMapView addAnnotation:annotation];\n\nThe problem is that you simply can't callout [self showCallOut]; after that because at run time it responds before MapKit has \"acknowledged\" the annotation drop.  I need to either create a delay (Would like to avoid this) or find the proper way to detect when annotations are in place and then run the showCallOut method.\nThanks for any help!\nThanks to aBitObvious below for providing a solution:\n- (void)mapView:(MKMapView *)mapView didAddAnnotationViews:(NSArray *)views {\n    [self performSelector:@selector(showCallOut) withObject:nil afterDelay:1];\n}\n\nA:\n\nTry using the didAddAnnotationViews delegate method:\n- (void)mapView:(MKMapView *)mapView didAddAnnotationViews:(NSArray *)views\n{\n    [self showCallOut];\n}\n\nMake sure your map view's delegate is set.\nEdit:\nIf you need to add a delay regardless, then try this instead (example with 1/2 second delay):\n- (void)mapView:(MKMapView *)mapView didAddAnnotationViews:(NSArray *)views\n{\n    [self performSelector:@selector(showCallOut) withObject:nil afterDelay:0.5];\n}\n\n"
