Apparently the answer is that user has to accept license before download.\nI know that it is possible (and required) to include a license to the artefact. But is it possible to force user to accept it before downloading and usage?\n\nA:\n\nIt's simply not possible cause Maven has no such mechanism. Apart from that it's interactive during the download of artifacts.\n\n"
