I never had any safety issues in Russia or the Ukraine but I wasn't in Chechnya. The only problems I had was with a pickpocket on the subway, gold digging Slavic women and standard Russian surliness, none physically dangerous.\n\nI've been teaching ESL strictly in Moscow for nearly 5 years and I can say overall I have not witnessed first-hand or been on the receiving end of any kind of violent criminal or terrorist act. Knocking on wood of course. But I was here for the last couple of most recent terrorist attacks.\n\nQuote:\n\nthe terrorism activities tend to focus on airports and other expat locations in Moscow to name a few.\nDo you find this to be so?\n\nWhile it was an extremely horrible and saddening time for all people living here in Moscow, it doesn't seem and I don't think terrorists are or have been targeting \"expat\" locations here. As far as major hubs of transport, that is a different question and are typically common targets in our new age of terrorist warfare.\n\nI haven't heard of any car bombings here or in the Moscow regions...potentially may happen in the southern regions of Russia..i.e., Dagestan.\n\nOverall, I can say I have felt myself safe. I am by no means a night owl and I'm married, so I tend to keep to myself and we do sometimes go out for meals in the center and all is fine. You have probably heard it a lot, but just always keep aware of your surroundings and always remain vigilant, as in any large city.\n\nOn a slightly other note, as far as the police go, I would not look to them for dutiful assistance in nearly any case. They are a corrupt bunch and largely useless, maybe good at breaking up large groups of citizen protesters or harassing and shaking down \"brown\" people.\n\nAnyways, best of luck to you and don't let this particular \"travel warning\" to scare you off from Russia, at least Moscow. There are tons of opportunities, many more once you are on the ground and it's quite an interesting place![/quote]\n\nThe peace-loving peoples of our glorious Motherland are not at all surprised by these slanderous attacks from the decadent Piggies in Londongrad. Pay them no heed, for they are simply lacking in any spirit of adventure, any soul! They are consumed with jealousy because our bonds of Slavic sympathy hold our Union firm - which stands in stark contrast to the imminent collapse of the UK.\n\nAgree with everything the other posters have said. Basic precautions, an absence of very bad luck, the exercise of basic common sense - these will all stand you in good stead in Moscow, as elsewhere.\n\nWhere exactly is the school? I never had any safety issues in Russia or the Ukraine but I wasn't in Chechnya. The only problems I had was with a pickpocket on the subway, gold digging Slavic women and standard Russian surliness, none physically dangerous.\n\nI knew a gold-digging Czech woman who was physically dangerous - she tried to run me over in a Skoda.\n\nWhere exactly is the school? I never had any safety issues in Russia or the Ukraine but I wasn't in Chechnya. The only problems I had was with a pickpocket on the subway, gold digging Slavic women and standard Russian surliness, none physically dangerous.\n\nThank you all for your comments.\nThe British report came a little out of left field and I didn't know what to think of it.\nAgain, I have not heard of such issues in Russia lately or in past years.\n\nAs a side note:\nI looked on the US Department of State site and it was the exact same information as the British site.\nSame wording and everything.\n\nbharrel - I am curious, did you look at the British report I put a link to in my post?\nWhat do you think of the safety problems spots they have listed?\n\nDear Chica88,\nI did look at the advisory. I have been gone from Eastern Europe for 4 years now, so I am not really knowledgeable, if I ever was. Someone living there now would know better. But if you are really concerned, I wouldn't go to the red or orange areas. Being constantly fearful is a terrible feeling and you likely wouldn't enjoy yourself. Why not find a school in the green zone on the map?\nMost all of the people I know about who ever got into trouble overseas were either drunk or on drugs or hanging around with the wrong crowd. Russia can be a bit intense sometimes, but in retrospect, I created most of my own fears.\n\nThe Russians do worry about terrorism and it does exist. However, the residents of London are about as likely to get blown up. So yes, the threat exists but no it isn't any greater than other parts of the world. In my opinion.\n\nI've lived in Russia for about 4 years, and I've never (knock on wood) had any problems with violent crime. And unless you're going to some infamously rough area of Russia (like Dagestan or Chechnya), it's just as safe as any area of the western world. Don't believe the hype! There is the usual petty theft that occurs, but with enough common sense, that's easy to prevent.\n\nOh yeah, common sense goes a long way. Heed any advice about bad parts of the city, and don't walk around alone at night in dark places. You need to be especially careful about alcohol, because the overwhelming majority of crimes I've heard of happened because the victim was wasted and therefore an easy target.\n\nThe country itself is much more dangerous than the people: bad roads, even worse drivers, and wily stray dogs will be the main nuisance in your daily life.\n\nI live in Stavropol, which is reputed to be pretty dangerous. I have lived here for 3 years and have never had any problems. We have had some action. There was a bombing in 2010 and two people were killed as I recall. There have been altercations between Russians and Caucasians from time to time, but I have always felt safe.\n\nI wouldn't let the travel advisory deter you. As someone stated above, you probably have the same chance of being a victim of terrorism in London as in Russia. If you are concerned, stay away from the Caucasus. Russia is a big country. What about Vladivostok? Siberia? The Urals?"
