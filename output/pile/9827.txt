Despite the Parkhead outfit\u2019s domestic dominance though, broadcast income is the main issue hampering their ability to keep pace with the world\u2019s highest earners.\n\nSPFL TV revenue is less than one per cent of the English top flight\u2019s while in La Liga, Real Madrid earned \u00a3161.4m from broadcast rights alone.\n\nA Deloitte spokesman said: \u201cCeltic are among the 40 highest revenue-generating football clubs in the world, having achieved \u00a375.8m in 2012-13, an uplift of \u00a324.5m (48 per cent) on the previous year.\n\n\u201cThe revenue increase was driven by the club\u2019s progress to the knockout stages of the Champions League.\n\n\u201cThis delivered substantial UEFA central distributions and contributed to an increase in match-day revenues due to a higher number of home games at Celtic Park, with a total of 30 in 2012-13 compared to 24 in the previous season.\n\n\u201cWhile domestic league broadcast contract values are a fraction of those for leagues in larger European markets, restricting Celtic\u2019s ability to compete for a top-20 position in the Money League, the club continues to benefit from a strong supporter base, with an average home league match attendance of 46,754.\u201d\n\nEngland boasted six clubs in the top 20 \u2013 both Manchester teams, Chelsea, Arsenal,\n\nLiverpool and Spurs.\n\nThis year\u2019s findings, which exclude player transfer fees, show a total combined revenue for the top 20 of a massive \u00a35.4billion (up eight per cent).\n\nIt includes two new entries \u2013 Turkish pair Galatasaray (16th) and Fenerbahce (18th) \u2013 from clubs outside Europe\u2019s big five leagues for the first time.\n\nTOP 10 RICHEST CLUBS\n\n1 Real Madrid \u00a3444.7m\n\n2 Barcelona \u00a3413.6m\n\n3 Bay Munich \u00a3369.6m\n\n4 Man Utd \u00a3363.2m\n\n5 PSG \u00a3341.8m\n\n6 Man City \u00a3271m\n\n7 Chelsea \u00a3260m\n\n8 Arsenal \u00a3243.6m\n\n9 Juventus 233.5m\n\n10 AC Milan \u00a3225.8m"
