According to the documentation the default mode for the \\per command is 'reciprocal' meaning \\si{m\\per s} should produce output akin to ms$^{-1}$ but on my system it is producing m/s.\nI have tried setting \\sisetup{per=reciprocal} and \\sisetup{per-mode=reciprocal} but it seems to ignore this and continues to use '/'. \nSpecifying the mode for individual units works but I don't want to have to type [per-mode=reciprocal] every time I want to typeset a unit.\nAm I missing something or is there a way to fix this (preferably without \\newcommand)?\n\nA:\n\nThe 'unit parser' in siunitx only operates on 'symbolic' units such as\n\\si{\\m\\per\\s}\n\\si{\\metre\\per\\second}\n\nwhere the behaviour of \\per is selectable. For the 'literal' input\n\\si{m\\per s}\n\nparsing is not possible ('literal' input could be anything), and instead \\per switches to simply inserting a /. Thus while the 'interpreted' mode requires slightly more typing, as it is more 'programmable' it's the recommended approach.\n\n"
