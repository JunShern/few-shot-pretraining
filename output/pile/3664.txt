They\u2019ve developed a comprehensive plan that combines spirituality, community support and science to create lasting weight loss. Learn the basics of this breakthrough plan!\n\nWho Is Daniel?\n\nIn the Old Testament, before he faces the fiery furnace and the lion\u2019s den, Daniel\u2019s resistance to the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar begins by refusing to eat the king\u2019s lavish meals and opting to eat vegetables instead. After the Babylonians ransacked Jerusalem and abducted young Israelites like Daniel to serve the king, it was expected that they would adhere to all the king\u2019s customs. However, Daniel was concerned about his health and challenged the king. After a 10-day trail, Daniel and his friends are prove to be healthier than the men in Nebuchadnezzar\u2019s service. Inspired by this story, Pastor Rick Warren changed his diet and challenged his friends and family to do the same.\n\nStep 1: Banish Sugar\n\nThe average American eats 130 pounds of sugar and 134 pounds of flour a year. Combined that\u2019s almost one pound of sugar per day! These sugary foods that cause your blood sugar to spike promote the production of insulin, a hormone linked to fat-storage. Avoiding sweets and refined grains is key to losing weight.\n\nStep 2: Load Up on Clean Carbs\n\nThe Daniel Plan is a high-carb diet, those carbohydrates just come from foods we don\u2019t traditionally think of as rich in carbohydrates. Instead of eating breads, pastas and cereals, you\u2019ll be eating fresh fruits and vegetables. These clean carbohydrates are the most important part of your diet and are essential for long-term weight loss. They are loaded with the vitamin and nutrients the body needs to heal itself.\n\nStep 3: Make Protein a Side Dish\n\nWhen it comes to protein on the Daniel Plan, start thinking of it as a side dish. When you\u2019re only eating a small serving of protein with every meal, you can focus on quality: fresh fish, whole eggs, organic chicken. Eating the right amount of protein will help regulate blood sugar, build muscle and balance brain chemistry.\n\nStep 4: Do It Together\n\nThe Daniel Plan requires the support of friends and family. When people try to lose weight on their own, they use willpower. Which works for a while, but for most people, the burden is too much to bear alone. Forming a support group, however, is the best way to make change last. The encouragement, support and feedback you get is essential to success. In Rick Warren\u2019s Saddleback congregation, 12,000 members worked together to lose more than 250,000 pounds! They found that when people worked together in small groups, they lost twice as much than people who did the program alone.\n\nDirections\nHeat olive oil in a large soup pot over medium heat.

Dip half of banana into melted chocolate and roll carefully into crushed walnuts.\n\nRepeat until all banana pieces are dipped.

Proteins are the building blocks of the body. They help boost energy, curb appetite and burn fat. You should be eating a minimum of 50 grams of protein every day.

The report also stated that at least 26 of the additives \u201cdid not meet standards set by the agency in 1973, which required companies to submit scientific studies proving the drugs were safe.\u201d (The Washington Post)\n\nDDT exposure linked to Alzheimer\u2019s disease: \u201cA new study links exposure to the insecticide DDT with Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\u201d Researchers found that 80% of patients with Alzheimer\u2019s had evidence of exposure to the pesticide, which was widely used from the 1940s to 1972 to kill mosquitos that cause malaria. About 70% of people without Alzheimer\u2019s also had evidence of DDT exposure, but the levels of DDE, a breakdown product of DDT, \u201cwere nearly four times higher in the blood of people with Alzheimer\u2019s.\u201d DDT was banned by the Environmental Protection Agency in 1972 due to concerns about the risk to wildlife, but \u201cDDT persists in the environment and in human blood and tissue.\u201d (USA Today)\n\nCDC to stay on cruise ship with nearly 650 sickened: \u201cThe CDC says more than 620 have been sickened on Royal Caribbean\u2019s Explorer of the Seas.\u201d Federal health officials are on board the cruise ship, which will arrive back to a port in New Jersey later this week, \u201ckeeping an eye on patients and trying to find the source of a nasty stomach bug that\u2019s sickened more than 620 people.\u201d Officials say norovirus, a common and highly infectious virus that commonly causes diarrhea and vomiting, is most likely to blame. \u201cIt can make as many as 21 million people sick every year and put 50,000 to 70,000 into the hospital,\u201d but fortunately it is not usually fatal. After the ship returns to port, it will be fully disinfected, according to Royal Caribbean. (NBC News)\n\nBreaking: Gynecologists Recommend Birth Control Pills Be Made Available Over-the-Counter!\n\nMexico is known for beautiful beaches, great guacamole and, as any woman who\u2019s forgotten to bring along that all-important pack of pills knows, over-the-counter hormonal contraception. That\u2019s right. You can wander into any pharmacy in Mexico and pick up a pack of birth control pills without a prescription \u2013 a convenience that doesn\u2019t exist in the US.\n\nA lot of people, including most gynecologists, think that should change. And, in a bold move, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) has just released a position statement recommending that oral contraceptive pills be sold over-the-counter.\n\nThe reasons for that endorsement are clear. According to the Guttmacher Institute, 50% of the pregnancies that occur in the United States each year are unplanned. By age 45, half of all American women will experience an unintended pregnancy. Every year, failed contraception, or no contraception, contributes to 3.2 million unintended pregnancies.\n\nBarriers to obtaining contraception, such as the prescription requirement, contribute to our nation\u2019s sky-high unintentional pregnancy rate. ACOG states that increasing availability of pills will improve usage of contraception. Other studies have consistently proven that when barriers such as cost and access are eliminated, unplanned pregnancy rates plummet.\n\nGetting a prescription is a huge burden to many women who have no regular physician, no insurance, and a job that doesn\u2019t allow the luxury of taking an afternoon off to go to see a doctor. The college student without a gynecologist (and without a car) doesn\u2019t have it any easier. Not to mention, many insurance companies only release one month of pills at a time. It\u2019s understandable how a prescription can lapse.\n\nOpponents to the OTC initiative say it is too dangerous. They express concern that high-risk women are likely to take birth control pills which will lead to in an increase in serious side effects such as blood clots and heart attacks. Please! Women deserve a little more credit. The average woman is more than capable of self-screening and determining if taking pills would be dangerous or inappropriate. No woman wants to have a stroke. If someone is 40, overweight, and a smoker, she is going to be informed that she is not a candidate for hormonal contraception just as a man with kidney failure is informed that over-the-counter painkillers are not safe. ACOG, known to be a medically conservative organization, strongly states that the benefits far outweigh the risks.\n\nTruth be told, the same people that say pills shouldn\u2019t be sold over-the-counter are often the same people that think insurance shouldn\u2019t cover contraception in the first place. And that abstinence education actually works. Or that easy access to contraception will increase teenage sexual activity. In other words, their political agenda, not women\u2019s health, is their priority.\n\nMexican women are more likely to stay on their pills and have no higher rates of complications than American women! In addition, evidence shows that even if the pill is available without a prescription, women will continue to show up for their annual checkups, Pap tests and STD screens.\n\nMost women spend the majority of their reproductive years trying to avoid becoming pregnant. The solution to lowering the country\u2019s high unintended pregnancy rate is not going to be completely solved by increasing access to contraception, but it\u2019s a really good start and I\u2019m all for it."
