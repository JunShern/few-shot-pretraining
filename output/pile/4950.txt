    "text": "USA Scrum, Photo Credit: Aaron Castro\n\nThe best way to explain this is overhaul. In total, 15 changes. 5 players move from starting to the bench. 3 Players from the training squad have been activated with three players being dropped. All players were available for selection. You can look at the changes being performance based against the Red Roses and also the need to try more combinations with the young squad. The best way to explain this is overhaul.

You can look at the changes being performance based against the Red Roses and also the need to try more combinations with the young squad.\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking from the pack: The big changes are Katy Augustyn earning starting selection and first appea rance in the 2019 Super Series pushing Joannna Kitlinski to the Bench. Nic James moves from reserve hooker to starting THP, flipping with Catie Benson who's moved to the Bench. Then in the engine room, Stacey Bridges slides to 4 and Alycia Washington earns starting selection at 5 with Kristine Sommer moving to the Bench. Asinate Serevi is dropped, which changes the back row with Elizabeth Cairns being activated and starting at Blindside. Captain Kate Zackary slides over from the Blindside to start at No 8. Overall some of these changes look to be made to address our overall strength in the scrum, but it seemed from the match against the Red Roses that the unit just wasn't strong enough rather than being a simple individual that could change the dynamic. Sommer, Benson, and Serevi were quite consistent on the day.\n\n\n\n"
