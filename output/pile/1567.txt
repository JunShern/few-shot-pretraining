We\u2019ve worked to identify Americans likely to benefit from a FREE pharmacy discount program where you and your entire family can save up to 75%* off costly prescriptions at virtually every pharmacy in America. Our pharmacy discount card has helped over 7 million consumers save a total of over $700,000,000 on their prescription medications.\n\nBelow are some of Rebates\u2019 most Frequently Asked Questions and Answers.\n\nHow does the card work?\n\nOur pharmacy discount card functions essentially like a coupon, and it\u2019s very simple to use. Just bring your card, along with your prescription, to the pharmacy. The pharmacist will enter the card\u2019s information into the computer and your discount will automatically be applied. The card covers all FDA-approved prescription medications and can be used an unlimited amount of times.\n\nWhat is the discount on my medication?\n\nThe discounts and savings on medications are provided by more than 60,000 participating pharmacies that have agreed to provide prices similar to what they give large insurance companies and employers. If you bring the card with your prescription to the pharmacy, your pharmacist can tell you the exact discount on your medication. Discounts typically range from 10% to 75%* and you can usually get a higher discount on generic drugs vs brand name drugs. Different pharmacies have different pricing and store policy, so prices may vary by location and store. For the best price, you can compare at your local pharmacies.\n\nDoes the pharmacy discount card or drug coupon work with insurance?\n\nNo, this card does not work with insurance. However, feel free to use your card to price check against your insurance. In some instances we may provide the lower price. For all other questions, please contact your provider.\n\nWhy did the discount of my medication change since the last time I filled the script?\n\nThe retail costs of medications often fluctuate, which is out of our control. Our discounts will vary by pharmacy and location depending on the store\u2019s prices and policies. We recommend comparing prices at different local pharmacies to see which one will get you the lowest price.\n\nThere was no discount on my medication or the price is higher with the card. Why did this happen?\n\nWe are sorry to hear that. Discounts for each medication will vary by pharmacy and store depending on store policy and pricing. We recommend checking prices at different local pharmacies to see where you can get the lowest price. The amount you can save will also depend on the prescription \u2013 we can usually save more on generic drugs vs brand name drugs.\n\nIf the price with the coupon was the same or higher than the pharmacy price, it\u2019s possible that your pharmacy applied its own discount to your prescription purchase, which happens to be a better price than the price using our card. Some big box stores like Costco and Walmart are able to discount certain generic drugs below wholesale cost. Unfortunately, we cannot offer additional savings on top of these deeply discounted rates.\n\nWhat happens if the pharmacy did not accept my card?\n\nPharmacies are required by state and federal law to process our prescription saving codes. Sometimes pharmacists may not know how to use or process our coupons. If you need help right away, please call our toll-free help line at 855-382-1280 and an agent can help you or speak to the pharmacist on your behalf.\n\nIs the Rebates pharmacy discount card accepted in Canada?\n\nNo, the pharmacy discount card and coupons are not accepted in Canada. This card works in all 50 states and all US territories. No person can be denied this benefit. There is no charge to use this card. It is pre-activated and ready to use.\n\nCan I use the Rebates discount card more than once?\n\nYes, you can use the coupons and discount card more than once.\n\nWill I be charged for using the pharmacy discount card or coupons? Any hidden fees?\n\nYou will never be charged for using this card. We will never sell or share your personal information with anyone. We do not make money from our cardholders. There is no charge to use this free pharmacy discount card, now or in the future.
