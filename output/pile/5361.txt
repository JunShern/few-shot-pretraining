Meanwhile\nthese days, game shows play for a top prize usually around $10k to $1mil per\nepisode. I guess in 1956, TV itself was enough to keep people entertained and\ntuned in. I wonder if 50 years from now, they'll be playing for people's lives\nor something equally crazy to keep jaded video audiences tuned in.\n\n~~~\nburgerbrain\nActually, there are still plenty of gameshows around where people play for\n(generally) sub-thousand dollar prizes. Cash Cab\n(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash_Cab>) comes to mind. $50 payouts on that\nshow are actually surprisingly common, although that is considered doing\npoorly.\n\nI suspect that the perception of the cash prize size is related to the\nperceived commitment the contestant has to put forward. So they are fairly\nlarge on shows the contestant has to go out of their way to be a part of, but\nlow on shows where the contestant just happens to \"stumble upon\" the contest.\n\n~~~\nJangoSteve\nThat's a very good point, and Cash Cab is sweet. Also, I was under the\nimpression that the people guessing in that gameshow were celebrities. Are\nthere any game-shows today that play for sub-thousand-dollar prizes with\ncelebrities?\n\n------\nkbutler\nIt's interesting to note links to historical events by very young observers.\n\nThe last of the civil war widows passed away only a few years ago (2008). As\nyoung women, they married octogenarian civil war veterans - and continued\nreceiving the widow's pension for decades...\n\n[http://www.radiodiaries.org/transcripts/OtherDocs/civilwar.h...](http://www.radiodiaries.org/transcripts/OtherDocs/civilwar.html)\n\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/16/national/16widow.html>\n\n<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maudie_Hopkins>\n\n------\nxefer\nI'm reminded of this:\n\n\"Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., who had served on the bench\ninto the nineteen-thirties, had in his long lifetime shaken hands with John\nQuincy Adams and also our new incumbent, John F. Kennedy.\"\n\n\"Old Country\" by Roger Angell. The New Yorker; September 11, 2006\n\n[http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/09/11/060911ta_talk_an...](http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/09/11/060911ta_talk_angell)\n\n~~~\nstrait\nHe lived long enough into the era where his speech or interview could have\nbeen filmed. I couldn't find anything on YouTube; perhaps he was too frail by\nthe 1930's to be doing such things.\n\nI like finding these old film clips featuring performances from ancient\nlegends.\n\nThomas Edison (born 1847)\n[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ftii6D68Veo&feature=relat...](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ftii6D68Veo&feature=related)\n\nSir Ian Hamilton (born 1853) <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlRruY4WRjw>\n\n------\nsiglesias\nI know this is what is referred to in Midnight in Paris as \"Golden Age\nThinking,\" but I can't fight the feeling when I see television programs and\ninterviews in the 50s and 60s that the level of \"popular\" discourse was much\nhigher then than it is now. That is, interviewees of all ages are much more\nwell spoken, articulate, and informed. I can't imagine the panel of American\nIdol judges (much less the audience) being able to drill down so quickly to a\nhistorical event like that, or even care to take a serious crack at it. Am I\noff?\n\nEx, a 60s era CBS documentary on rock--fair from and to both sides:\n<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSq1ca__cRA>\n\n~~~\nneonscribe\nDid you notice the last word spoken by the host Garry Moore was \"withal\",\nmeaning \"nevertheless\". Can you imagine a game show host using the word today?\n\n~~~\njerf\nYes. Or rather, the temporally-updated equivalent. Withal sounds erudite\nbecause _now_ it's dead, and a sign of sophistication to know the word at all.\nMuch less so then, albeit perhaps not zero.\n\nThe problem with some modern game shows isn't vocabulary. It isn't even\nnecessarily spectacle _qua_ spectacle, because if they could have done it and\nafforded it in the 50s their shows would have been bigger, too. Humans haven't\nchanged in the past 60 years. The problem with modern game shows is something\nmore like they have more resources than they know what to do with, competing\nagainst ten other shows with the same \"problem\". I'm not convinced there's a\ngood argument for modern people being more relatively degenerate than people\nof old... the set of which, I would remind you, _really does_ include actual,\nfactual people who considered combat to the death fit entertainment.\n\n------\nhugh3\n\"But apart from that, Mr Seymour, how was the play?\"\n\n------\nhook\nI think Matt Damon has a time machine.\n\n~~~\nhugh3\nThe Matt Damon looking guy is fifties game show fixture Bill Cullen:\n\n<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Cullen>\n\nand he looks less Matt Damonish in higher resolution.\n\n~~~\npyre\nHe looks more like Drew Carey at that resolution.\n\n------\nstarpilot\nOn a related note, the last surviving Civil War veteran (though he never saw\ncombat) also died in 1956.\n\n<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Woolson>\n\n~~~\nsplat\nInterestingly, the last widow of a Civil War veteran died only three years\nago.\n\n<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maudie_Hopkins>\n\n------\nck2\nIt's easy to forget the United States is \"only\" 235 years old. Columbus sailed\nover TWICE as long ago.\n\nSome countries would laugh at that\n<http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=10+oldest+countries>\n\n(added: _actually, wait a sec, Wolfram is very wrong, Portugal Italy and Spain\nall existed when Columbus first sailed_ )\n\nMechanical steam power, automobiles, airflight, television, computers and\nlanding on the moon was all accomplished in that relatively tiny timeframe of\nUS existence.\n\n~~~\njustincormack\nItaly did not exist then as a country. It was unified by Garibaldi in 1861.\nPortugal is older, Spain, depends how you count it, but it was Castile and\nAragon until 1469, and Granada was reconquered in 1492...\n\n------\nscottyallen\nWow, that's truly fascinating. Seeing that 5 minute clip gives me a much\nbetter feeling for how long ago Lincoln's death really was. Deeply\nunderstanding timelines was always my weakness when it came to history, which\nis part of why high school history was thoroughly boring to me. Now I can saw,\nwhen my parents were 5, they saw a really old guy on TV who was 5 when he saw\nLincoln shot. A lot more digestible than 1865 or 146 years ago.\n\n~~~\nmatt1\nHey, just a quick plug:\n\nI run a web app called Preceden [1], which specializes in creating\nmultilayered timelines. You could easily use it to plot the significant events\nin your life and anyone else's to see how they overlap. Lots of teachers use\nit to solve the same problem you have had; visualizing time can be very\ndifficult without the right tools.\n\n[1] <http://www.preceden.com>\n\nEdit: Just for fun, here's a timeline of the Civil War, Mr Seymour's life, the\nI've Got a Secret Episode, and today's date using Preceden:\n\n[http://preceden.com/timelines/15108-i-ve-got-a-secret---\nlinc...](http://preceden.com/timelines/15108-i-ve-got-a-secret---lincoln-\nassassination)\n\n~~~\nalanfalcon\nVery cool tool. But it appears that the \"article appears on Hacker News\" is\ncut off.\n\n~~~\nmatt1\nThanks -- FYI you can scroll over by dragging the timeline around.\n\nEdit: Added a 25 year zoom level to the timelines, which makes this timeline\n(and I'm sure others) fit better.\n\n------\ncma\nIf you are older than 23, you have been around for more than 10% of the US's\nhistory since the constitution was ratified. Pretty crazy to think about.\n\nThe oldest living American has been around for more than 50% of it.\n\n------\ndabent\nThe fact that I could see an eyewitness to that event was overshadowed by the\nhuge cigarette ads. It reminds me of the current state of online ads, only\nit's huge banners for electronic cigarettes instead.\n\n~~~\nthere\ni'm currently reading _the master switch_ (<http://amzn.to/qvgGrx>) which\ntalks about how early radio and tv were forbidden to have commercials because\nthey were supposed to be public services, but that programs could be sponsored\nlike you see in the video. in early radio, companies weren't allowed to\ndirectly mention their products, so for example, gillette's first radio ad was\na lecture on the history of beards.\n\nafter seeing that video, i much prefer commercials to that style of sponsored\nprogramming. when a commercial comes on, you can get up and do something else,\nchange the channel, or mute it. with sponsored programs, everything is so\nintegrated that it makes it hard to ignore.\n\n~~~\nchollida1\nNon minified and non link code to the above amazon link:\n\n<http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003F3PKTK/>\n\n------\nDanielBMarkham\nWow, this is amazing. I can't help but want to ask him questions -- what was\nDC like during and after the war? How did Marylanders view the assassination\n(after all, Booth hid out in MD for most of his run.) Did the huge numbers of\nUnion troops make a lasting impact on DC? Did his family know people on both\nsides of the war? Did he see any of the heroes from war later on in his life?\nAttend a speech they made or a book-signing? Did he see Grant on any of his\nfamous carriage rides through the city? Know anybody who had personally spoken\nwith any of the presidents? (Back then you could just show up at the WH and\nask for an audience.) What did he think of the many civil war reunions and\njoint parades that previous fighters from both sides participated in?\n\nYou know, there's a finite number of these questions, and they can be broken\ndown into an ontology and recorded. You could even make such and information\nsystem interactive, and 3D. It's a shame we don't have startups that could\nrecord and organize this same type of information from present-day folks who\nwitnessed history -- like those that saw the D-Day invasion, or the Civil\nRights movement in the U.S. We are losing precious pieces of our past, and we\nhave tech that could make a big difference here. We spend more time worrying\nabout polygon counts on shooters and less time about capturing these\nincredible stories that are disappearing all around us.\n\n~~~\nmatt1\nSimilar to this idea, Steven Spielberg established a foundation called the\nSurvivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation to interview holocaust and\nwarcrime survivors. According to their about page, they've done over 52,000\nvideo testimonials so far.\n\nYou can check it out on the University of Southern California's website here:\n<http://dornsife.usc.edu/vhi/>\n\n------\ntormentor\nIts amazing we actually got to see an eyewitness of something this historical\non tv. The fact that tech had evolved this fast in this man's 96 years of life\nis amazing in itself. Just imagine going from a time where you didn't have\nelectricity in your home to having a camera recording you. The cigarette ads\nare irrelevant.\n\n"
