    "text": "- Skinny Dip are closing their store on the Hayes Arcade. Their final day trading will be May 8th. Designer watch brand Daniel Wellington are expected to open their 5th UK store from this unit (KLG04). This will be the brands first UK venture outside of London.\n\n- Yankee Candle are rumoured to be opening in unit LG91, which is the unit previously occupied by Crocs.\n\nI just read this. My opinion on marketing/comms people has taken a knock recently after seeing some shoddy work (not where I work incidentally). But this is pretty shocking given this is an asset worth upwards of \u00a3600 million.\n\nHere are some quotes:\n\nbrochure wrote:A new train station has beenconfirmed for Bow Street, Wales anda total investment of \u00a33.95m from theDepartment for Transport which is setto be complete by March 2020.\n\nFirst of all, that sentence isn't proper English. Second, why are they telling us about a small station in Ceredigion, around 100 miles or so from Cardiff?\n\nbrochure wrote:Works are progressing on phasestwo and three of the 265,976 sq ftscheme which will include a new\u00a3120m headquarters for BBCCymru Wales, and are scheduledfor completion by 2018\n\nErm, what scheme? I know what it is, but the brochure just says this without saying the scheme...\n\nbrochure wrote:After 10 years of deliberation, Cardiff\u2019sbus station plans have been approvedand works are due to start in April 2018.The mixed use development is set toinclude a 14-stand bus station, retailspace as well as offices and apartments.\n\nWho on earth thought it would be good in a marketing brochure to talk about 10 years of deliberations being required for a bus station?\n\nDid noone at Intu spot this? Noone at St Davids management team? Its just shoddy and if I were an investor at Intu, I'd be disappointed. And a manager, ashamed.\n\nFollowing the successful arrival of Stradivarius, Inditex are opening their sixth UK Bershka store in Cardiff. At present Bershka currently operates four stores in London and one in Brighton. Bershka is one of Inditex's key facias in Europe and is most certainly a coup for Cardiff.\n\nA planning application has been submitted for the unit previously occupied by Mothercare (UG01/02). A great location for the brand directly opposite Stradivarius and alongside New Look & H&M!\n\nSadly, Bershka will not be making use of the Mezzanine floor and therefore the store will be over one level.\n\nLandSec/Intu have done a great job developing their relationship with Inditex in order to secure these brands in Cardiff. It would be great to see a Zara Home store in one of the units outside John Lewis on the Upper Grand Arcade and potentially Pull & Bear in the unit once occupied by DV8.\n\nThe lease for unit LG39 (Fossil) is currently being advertised. The unit comprises of 2,179 sq ft of retail space and there's 5 years left on the lease. The adjoining unit LG40 (which Godiva was once negotiating) is also still available."
