I have seen the indirect formula used a lot but I'm not sure if I can string together all that I am trying to do here.\n\nI have created within the X column of SS Sales a formula that calculates the data range based on install dates.  So 1/1/13 to 4/1/13 may equal (DT14:BL41). The X column gives me this answer depending on dates that change.\nI need to use the range determined by cell X2 in SS Sales(DT14:BL41) in a COUNTA formula to count what is actually open on the calendar, which is on a separate sheet within the same workbook.\nThis is what I am trying but it doesn't work:\n\n=COUNTA('install calendar copy'!(INDIRECT('SS Sales'!X2))\n\nA:\n\nYou need 'SS Sales'!X2 to contain the text string 'install calendar copy'!DT14:BL41 then =COUNTA(INDIRECT('SS Sales'!X2)) should give you what you want.\n\n"
