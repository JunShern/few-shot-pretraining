Where can I find those guidelines bkerensa ?\n<MrChrisDruif> Do you mean the COF with that web badge btw?\n<bkerensa> MrChrisDruif: http://design.canonical.com/the-toolkit/ubuntu-brand-guidelines/ and yeah just a badge so bloggers and contributors can advocate on their blog for Ubuntu.... I have a Mozilla badge for instance\n<MrChrisDruif> Have they changed recently?\n<MrChrisDruif> Something like twibbon for adding to someone's avatar?\n<bkerensa> well the only one I could find was on Spreadubuntu and it uses the old logo\n<MrChrisDruif> I've used something like twibbon to add the COF to my avatar on facebook\n<bkerensa> nice\n<MrChrisDruif> So it's already out there, but not always as user-friendly as you'd want\n<bkerensa> But that is for avatars and not mean as a 125x125 web badge for blogs\n<bkerensa> http://affiliates-cdn.mozilla.org/media/uploads/banners/download_beta_small.png\n<bkerensa> thats what I mean something inviting\n<MrChrisDruif> bkerensa; can't you use this svg to make a 125x125 png? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:UbuntuCoF.svg\n<czajkowski> wendar: we're going to be busy on panels at fosdem\n<sladen> bkerensa: could you clarify, a pre-rendered PNG @ 125x125  and do you want CoF, or Word mark, or just the text?\n<sladen> bkerensa: or a banner\n<czajkowski> sladen: you coming to FOSDEM ?\n<bkerensa> sladen: I was think a banner with the wordmark and some sort of text that said maybe Try Ubuntu today or something\n<sladen> bkerensa: so more like a blog advert banner etc\n<MrChrisDruif> Ah, a bit like that firefox icon you showed yesterday?\n<bkerensa> sladen: Yeah like Mozzilla pushes for their FOSS products\n * bkerensa would rather advertise FOSS then actually sell products on his blog for instance\n<sladen> bkerensa: http://launchpad.net/ubuntu-branding/+filebug?field.title=Wishlist:+advert+banners+for+blogs+in+standard+sizes\n<sladen> bkerensa: and list the sizes that you're after, and what you'd like to see in them (if there are standards for these, can you link to them too)\n<bkerensa> k\n#ubuntu-design 2012-01-17\n<wendar> czajkowski: yup, FOSDEM is shaping up nicely (I'm at Linux.conf.au this week, just got network access to catch up)\n<dholbach> good morning\n<czajkowski> wendar: busy !\n<om26er> oh co'mon\n#ubuntu-design 2012-01-18\n<dholbach> good morning\n<doctormon> hey everyone\n<doctormon> Our weekly meeting will start in 8 mins\n<doctormon> OK time to start\n<doctormon> does anyone have any questios before I go into our progress?\n<doctormon> ok great\n<doctormon> So this week wendar is at SCALE and can't join us.\n<doctormon> There haven't been any further requests for design help from any projects this week\n<doctormon> There haven't been any requests for production help either.\n<doctormon> The work items on https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/community-p-ux-participation are going well.\n<doctormon> Does anyone have anything to add?\n<doctormon> Okay then, thanks to everyone for coming and I'll see you all next week.\n<doctormon> Remember to email or message here in IRC if you have any requests or ideas.\n#ubuntu-design 2012-01-19\n<dholbach> good morning\n<om26er> swilson, Hey! about the wallpaper changing on the login screen, as the selected username changes, someone made an interesting point\n<om26er> \"Don't they have some sorta privacy problem with this? Like, if teenage boy wants to have nekkid lady wallpapers, maybe he don't want it to come up on family computer... Dunno, maybe it's not an issue?\"\n<swilson> hi there! yes, i believe that a bug has been created which raises this same issue - about embarrassing or confidentiality issues with this\n<swilson> this seems to be a bit of an edge case, but it may be significant enough to warrant giving some careful thought\n<imnichol> Or if you have bank info on your screen before it's locked\n#ubuntu-design 2012-01-20\n<doctormon> pleia2: https://bugs.launchpad.net/spreadubuntu/+bug/919197\n<webbugs> Launchpad bug 919197 in SpreadUbuntu \"New Category Needed 'Banners'\" [Undecided,New]\n<pleia2> doctormon: yay!\n<pleia2> I'll send an email to the web guy who usually runs things when I have a chance (am at SCALE10x this weekend, and muy busy)\n<doctormon> pleia2: awesome, thanks\n<mcbaine1>  Hi there ::: I'm really excited about going to FOSDEM  ... I put an advert in the national newspaper to see if anyone else is going and to get in touch etc...

I guess there must be.\n<mpt> Can't find it, though.\n<xnox> mpt: down pointing green arrow, let me find it for you.\n<mpt> thanks\n<mpt> Dear Gimp, showing/hiding a layer is not the type of action that should go into the undo/redo stack\n<xnox> find /usr/share/icons/ -name '*download*'\n<xnox> gives me: /usr/share/icons/Humanity/actions/48/browser-download.svg\n<xnox> /usr/share/icons/gnome/scalable/places/folder-download-symbolic.svg\n<xnox> (which is a fancy dotted down arrow)\n<davidcalle> mpt, hi, I see you have trouble finding icons : do you know about https://launchpad.net/icon-library ?\n<mpt> davidcalle, I did not!\n<davidcalle> mpt, it's fantastic. You just need to download it and run the icon-library.py file\n<davidcalle> life changer :)\n<mpt> Sweet!\n<mpt> ...And no, there doesn't seem to be a plain download icon. There's browser-download, cluttered with a disk.\n<mpt> I guess that's the closest.\n<xnox> mpt: /usr/share/icons/gnome/48x48/emblems/emblem-downloads.png here is one cluttered with progress-bar\n<mpt> yeah :-)\n<xnox> /usr/share/icons/unity-icon-theme/places/svg/group-downloads.svg is a generic one, cluttered with a circle and it's not green\n<mpt> Is there ever a good time to include a progress bar in an icon?\n<xnox> /usr/share/icons/gnome/scalable/places/folder-download-symbolic.svg or dots?! =)\n<mpt> As opposed to overlaying a genuine progress bar over top of the icon.\n<xnox> mpt: well it's a clear indication that progress bars lie to you and huge downloads usually stall anyway and one never gets what one wants? =)))))\n * mpt wonders if \"It's just  a string change!\" is the UI equivalent of \"It's just a flesh wound!\"\n<mpt> When I insert an audio CD, I get a dialog, \"You have just inserted an audio CD. Choose what application to launch.\"\n<mpt> The default option is \"Ask what to do\", but it's ALREADY DONE THAT\n<xnox> so the drop down default should be moved further down to \"Lauch Music Player Rhythmbox\"?\n<xnox> yeah that option doesn't make sense. cause i want to keep it asking what to do & offer what to do _now_ at the same time.\n<PaoloRotolo> Hi all!\n#ubuntu-design 2013-01-17\n<mpt> Hi snwh!!!\n<mpt> LOUD NOISES\n<mpt> Oh dear, what did I do\n<snwh> mpt, what did you do?\n<mpt> snwh, you complained how quiet #ubuntu-design was, so I said \"Hi snwh!!!\" and \"LOUD NOISES\" and you dropped off IRC immediately\n<snwh> mpt, oh.
