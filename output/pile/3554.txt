I use Open Office (I like it, and it's free), but I reckon controlling the creation of docs programmatically is probably easier/better documented for MS Word than it is for Open Office and/or Libre Office - that's why I'm strongly considering making this \"rendezvous with Redmond.\"\nThis question is tangentially related to this one\nIf Google Docs is a possibility here, I'd be willing to have a \"meeting with Mountain View\" but I know nothing about that file format or whether it can be \"automated\" etc.\nI need to end up with something that I can either convert to a PDF file or a DOCX file. Open Office can open DOCX and convert files to PDF, but I don't know about Google Docs.\n\nA:\n\nI've found https://docx.codeplex.com/ to be very useful in dynamically building docx documents.\n\n"
