S-400 provides that assurance and is compatible with its current platform. Friends understand that these discussions with Russia started several years ago, hence I do not believe U.S. will impose sanction[s] on India.\u201d\n\nSanctions warranted by the Countering America\u2019s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act or CAATSA, which comes into play in the event of a major purchase like the S-400 missile defence system, may be bypassed by a presidential waiver. Ahead of the deal, the U.S. had urged India not to purchase S-400. It had reiterated on Friday:\n\n\u201cThe Administration has indicated that a focus area for the implementation of CAATSA Section 231 is new or qualitative upgrades in capability \u2014 including the S-400 air and missile defence system,\u201d the White House NSC Spokesperson said.\n\nSanctions on China\n\nLast month, the U.S. had imposed sanctions on China for the purchase of S-400 from Russia.\n\n\u201cOur recent action to sanction a Chinese government entity for an S-400 delivery underscores the seriousness of our resolve on this issue. The waiver authority is not country-specific. There are strict criteria for considering a waiver,\u201d said the spokesperson.\n\nThe State Department, which is tasked with reviewing the deal and initiated the process of sanctions or waiver under CAATSAA, and then recommend to the President, did not respond to the question on the time frame and the process.\n\nHowever, an industry source said the law is ambiguous about \u201cwhen a waiver is necessary so this can be avoided for years\u201d.\n\nThe National Defence Authorisation ACT (NDDA) 2019 gives President the power to waive the CAATSA sanctions if it is national security interest. It also lists out several other options for presidential waiver, prominent among which is that the purchase country \u2014 India in this case \u2014 is taking or will take steps to reduce its inventory of major defence equipment and advanced conventional weapons produced by the defence sector of the Russian Federation as a share of its total inventory of major defence equipment and advanced conventional weapons over a specified period.\n\n\u2018Major Defence Partner\u2019\n\nThe top arms purchaser over the last decade and more, India has gradually reduced its dependence on Russian arms. It now stands at about 60%, which is much lower than it was a decade ago. The U.S. has been a major beneficiary of this move.\n\nAs part of its diversification plan, India has increased its purchase of arms from the U.S. from about zero to more than $18 billion. India is in the process of purchasing arms and equipment worth billions of dollars from the U.S. in the coming years including armed and unarmed drones and fighter jets.\n\nA presidential waiver can also be given if a country \u2014 such as India, in this case \u2014 is cooperating with the U.S. government on other security matters critical to its strategic interests. Experts believe that is exactly the case and one of the main reasons for the U.S. designating India as a \u2018Major Defence Partner\u2019.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like to make predictions in today\u2019s Washington but sanctioning India, and surrendering the Indian defence market to Russia, would have exactly the opposite of the intended effect of CAATSA. No American interest group benefits from sanctioning India,\u201d Benjamin Schwartz from U.S. India Business Council said.\n\nHe has previously served as the director for India in the U.S. office of the secretary of defence.\n\nAparna Pande, from the Hudson Institute think-tank, said, \u201cI believe what is more likely is that even though India will sign the S-400 deal, it will delay payment, etc., so that the sanctions don\u2019t come into effect.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis way India maintains its strategic autonomy and historical ties with Russia and yet ensures its strategic relationship with the U.S. is not impacted either,\u201d Ms. Pande said.\n\nAccording to Rick Rossow, from the Centre for Strategic and International Studies think tank, \u201cCongress widened the waiver criteria with India in mind, and the fact we had a robust \u20182+2 Dialogue\u2019 in Delhi a month back shows that the administration believes in the momentum.\u201d\n\nThe Russian Embassy in the U.S. tweeted that the delivery of S-400 would begin in October 2020."
