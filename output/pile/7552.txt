Disease is caused by disruptions to this flow. Acupuncture corrects imbalances in the flow of qi by stimulating specific anatomical locations on or under the skin. The most common mechanism of stimulation of acupuncture points is penetration of the skin by thin disposable needles.\n\nAbout our Acupuncturist\n\nAndrew Crapo is a nationally certified and state registered acupuncturist as well as a member of the Michigan Association of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine.\n\nHe graduated Summa Cum Laude and valedictorian from Pacific College of Oriental Medicine with a Master of Science in Traditional Oriental Medicine (MSTOM). In addition to traditional acupuncture, Andrew has extensive training in herbal medicine and offers cosmetic acupuncture to his patients.\n\nAndrew also holds a Bachelor of Science in Biomedical Science from Western Michigan University where he graduated with honors.\n\nAndrew\u2019s passion for Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) stems from having been treated with TCM his entire life by his father, Dr. Mark Crapo, one of the first certified acupuncturists in the state of Michigan; thus knowing the amazing healing properties it holds. His wish is to teach as many people as possible about TCM as well as share the experience of attaining wellness with all of his clients.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions:\n\nDoes Acupuncture Hurt? Most people are surprised to find out that acupuncture is not painful. Acupuncture needles are very fine and are inserted gently into the skin with the use of a guide tube. Once the needles are inserted it is common to feel deeply relaxed. Acupuncture feels really good!\n\nWhat is Chinese Herbal Medicine? Herbal medicine consists of blending individual Chinese herbs into formulas. The formula usually consists of two to twelve different herbs. Herbal formulas have demonstrated excellent results for thousands of years and have fewer side effects than conventional pharmaceutical medications. Herbal formulas come in many forms: pills, capsules, granules and tinctures, which are much more convenient and less time consuming than the brewing of tea.\n\nHow does Acupuncture work? Chinese medical theory maintains that the human body is a complex bio-energetic system. The pathways through which our life energy flows, qi as it is called in Chinese medicine, are known as channels or meridians. If the flow or balance of qi is disrupted or damaged, pain; abnormal body functions; or disease will ensue. Acupuncture works by stimulating the flow of energy at points along the meridians as prescribed for a specific treatment. By balancing and regulating the flow of qi, the body can then heal itself.\n\nAlthough a great deal of research has been done, the exact mechanism by which acupuncture works has not been pinned down by western science. One example of acupuncture\u2019s effectiveness is pain relief, believed to be due to the triggering of the release of endorphins, a natural pain reducing substance within the body itself. Acupuncture has been proposed to also effect the release of specific hormones and neurotransmitters as well as other body regulating substances. Although unexplained, the benefits and results are well documented, from ancient times to present day. Acupuncture works!\n\nAre there any side effects of Acupuncture? The main side effect of acupuncture is a deep state of calm and relaxation. You may feel a warm or tingling sensation throughout your body. Though it is rare, a hematoma (also known as a bruise) may appear at the needled site.\n\nOriental Medicine\n\nThe philosophy of Oriental Medicine dictates that every individual must be treated based upon his or her own condition, symptoms and physical constitution. Every patient is evaluated as a whole, with treatment based upon a thorough examination of symptoms, medical history, blood pulse and physical examination, as well as concerns of emotional and mental origin. Acupuncture and herbal medicine are a natural medicine that encourages the body to heal itself."
