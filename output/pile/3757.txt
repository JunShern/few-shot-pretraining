    "text": "Friday - Roatan (West End or South side Roatan) for two dives, lunch then return to dock, sunset cocktail party/dinner ashore\n\nSaturday: 8 am Check Out\n\nPRIMARY DIVING SITES of the ROATAN AGGRESSOR\n\nThe Roatan Aggressor dives the best of the Bay Islands. These islands are Honduras' brightest gems offering divers sheer walls, beautiful shallow reefs, spectacular wrecks and offshore sea mounts. These pristine sea mounts represent a Caribbean frontier rarely explored by divers. Here are some of the areas the Roatan Aggressor will visit.\n\nROATAN ISLANDMary\u2019s Place \u2013 One of the most famous dive sites off of the south side of Roatan, Mary\u2019s Place has a lush reef with crevasses and tunnels running through it that provide great photo opportunities.Taviana\u2019s Wall - Lots of turtles are found here and this site makes a great night dive with octopus, crabs and lobsters.Wreck of the Aquila- This wreck is home to 15 - 20 large Groupers and a big blue Parrot Fish, as well as a big green Moray Eel that is always willing to come out and play.Odyssey Wreck - This freighter is Roatan\u2019s largest wreck measuring 300 feet long, 50 feet wide, and 85 feet tall. It is one of the largest wrecks in the Caribbean.\n\nThe SEA MOUNTCoco\u2019s Sea Mount - Coco\u2019s beauty is in the mix of coral and good visibility that divers always enjoy. The ocean floor rises from hundreds of feet to only 40 feet from the surface. These sea mounts are far from Utila and Roatan, therefore, they are rarely visited by day boat divers.UTILA ISLANDBlack Hills \u2013 A favorite among all divers, you can count on seeing schools of Creole Wrasse, Atlantic Spadefish, Horse-eye Jack and Southern Sennets at this seamount, along with Scorpionfish, Toadfish and the rare Frog Fish. A resident turtle appears unafraid of divers, as do the Barracuda. Large pelagic fish can be spotted here, such as Manta Rays, Marlin, and sharks including the big boy himself, the Whale Shark!Duppy Waters \u2013 A coral garden begins beneath the boat at 20 feet, with walls sloping off into the blue. Eagle Rays, stingrays, octopus and schools of Creole Wrasse and Blue Tang are in abundance.CJ\u2019s Drop-off - This is one for the deep dive enthusiast. Spiny Caribbean Lobster, Golden Tail Moray and schools of Jack are plentiful.Raggedy Cay \u2013 This popular site begins at 30 feet and falls away to 130 feet, with Majestic Eagle Rays swooping by and Hawksbill Turtles munching away on soft corals. Octopus can be found around the sand channels along the coral garden as well as Spotted Morays.Old Bank \u2013 This is a very nice shallow dive site, where the rare Elkhorn Coral flourishes and smaller critters, like the Fringed Filefish and Caribbean Reef Squid, can be seen along the walls. In the sandy areas, the allusive Yellowhead Jawfish can be spotted peering out of its hole.Cannery Bank \u2013 Here\u2019s a prime opportunity to witness large pelagic fish that roam the open waters. There are lots of vibrant color on the mounts, beginning at 25 feet and sloping to 110 feet.Jack Neil Point \u2013 Sand, walls and individual coral heads make this a must dive. Long snout Seahorse, Large-eye Toadfish, Flying Gurnards, and octopus make this one of the area\u2019s best night dives.Halliburton Wreck \u2013 Sunk in 1998, this artificial reef begins at 65 feet with the wheelhouse and continues down to the vessel bottom at 100 feet. Green Morays, Spotted Drum, Yellowline Arrow Crabs, Channel Clinging Crabs and Bearded Fire Worms are usually seen on this exceptional deep dive, as well as the occasional Porcupine Fish and Pipefish.Hawksbill Bank \u2013 The Roatan Aggressor is one of a few that visit this seamount beginning at 40 feet and sloping down to 80 feet. Bluebell tunicates are in abundance, and the rare Fingerprints can also be found. A resident Hawksbill turtle gives the site its name.\n\nCAYOS COCHINOSToon Town- Known for its macro life, this dive off Cayos Cochinos is jam-packed with big clumps of bluebell tunicates, small crabs and flamingo tongue cowries, among a long laundry list of headliners from the tinier marine kingdoms.Pelican Point - every kind of reef fish imaginable, including French and queen angelfish, butterfly fish, tangs, and parrotfish. On the outside of the reef, you may see sharks and barracuda patrolling"
