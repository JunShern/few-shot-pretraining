    "text": "Which player led the league in meaningless receiving yards last year? Wait, what are meaningless receiving yards?\n\nI am defining a meaningless receiving yard as one where:\n\nOn third or fourth down, a player gained fewer yards than necessary for the first down.\n\nThe receiving yard(s) came in a loss and when the player\u2019s team trailed by at least 28 points.\n\nThe receiving yard(s) came in a loss and when the player\u2019s team trailed by at least 21 points with fewer than 15 minutes remaining.\n\nThe receiving yard(s) came in a loss and when the player\u2019s team trailed by at least 14 points with fewer than 8 minutes remaining.\n\nThe receiving yard(s) came in a loss and when the player\u2019s team trailed by at least 9 points with fewer than 3 minutes remaining.\n\nThis definition is not perfect \u2014 Le\u2019Veon Bell had a 29-yard reception on 3rd-and-30 last season against the Patriots, and then rushed for a first down on 4th-and-1 \u2014 but I think it gets us close enough to perfect that I feel comfortable using it. The results aren\u2019t too surprising \u2014 two Jaguars ranked in the top three, separated by the player who led the league in receiving yards \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t have to be the end of the analysis.\n\nCecil Shorts led the league with 351 meaningless receiving yards, which accounts for 45% of all of Shorts\u2019 yards last season. That might lead you to think that Shorts\u2019 777 receiving yards were misleading or inflated because they came against soft defenses. However, 45% of Shorts\u2019 targets last season came in meaningless situations, too. So there\u2019s reason to think his gross number of yards last year isn\u2019t misleading at all, and he wasn\u2019t taking advantage of soft defenses \u2014 he just had lots of opportunities against them.1\n\nThe table below shows all players with at least 100 meaningless receiving yards from 2013, along with their number of total receiving yards, percentage of receiving yards that were meaningless, meaningless targets, total targets, and meaningless target percentage.\n\nJosh Gordon\u2019s line is interesting. While he was second in the league with 282 meaningless receiving yards, that represented only 17.1% of his total receiving yards. Meanwhile, nearly 28% of his targets came in these meaningless situations. Let\u2019s take a game-by-game look at Gordon\u2019s stat line:\n\nWk\n\nOpp\n\nYards\n\nTar\n\nMean Yd\n\nMean Tar\n\n3\n\nMIN\n\n146\n\n19\n\n5\n\n5\n\n4\n\nCIN\n\n71\n\n9\n\n0\n\n2\n\n5\n\nBUF\n\n86\n\n6\n\n0\n\n0\n\n6\n\nDET\n\n126\n\n9\n\n0\n\n0\n\n7\n\nGNB\n\n21\n\n6\n\n14\n\n4\n\n8\n\nKAN\n\n132\n\n10\n\n0\n\n1\n\n9\n\nBAL\n\n44\n\n7\n\n17\n\n3\n\n11\n\nCIN\n\n125\n\n15\n\n0\n\n7\n\n12\n\nPIT\n\n237\n\n17\n\n158\n\n8\n\n13\n\nJAX\n\n261\n\n15\n\n0\n\n1\n\n14\n\nNWE\n\n151\n\n10\n\n4\n\n1\n\n15\n\nCHI\n\n67\n\n10\n\n43\n\n4\n\n16\n\nNYJ\n\n97\n\n16\n\n6\n\n4\n\n17\n\nPIT\n\n82\n\n10\n\n35\n\n4\n\nTotal\n\n1646\n\n159\n\n282\n\n44\n\nIn the final 7 minutes of the Steelers game, Gordon caught 7 of 8 targets for 158 yards and a touchdown. At no point during that stretch were the Browns ever down by less than 16 points. I\u2019m okay saying that Gordon racked up some garbage time yards there. But the amazing part is how infrequently Gordon piled up meaningless yards. In only two other games did he top 20 meaningless receiving yards, and in neither of those games did he hit the 50-yard mark. On the contrary, against the Bengals (in week 11) and Vikings, Gordon had 12 meaningless targets for 5 yards and 34 meaningful targets for 271 yards. While Gordon was putting up numbers for a bad team that passed a ton while trailing, I wouldn\u2019t discount his numbers because of the game situation (you would, of course, discount his numbers because of the sheer volume of passes attempted by Browns quarterbacks).\n\nAnother player with Gordon-like metrics was Washington\u2019s Pierre Garcon. It\u2019s easy to dismiss his league-leading 113 catches as the by-product of playing for a 3-13 team. But Garcon wasn\u2019t racking up the yards in garbage time: despite often playing in meaningless situations, only 15% of his receiving yards came then, compared to 29% of his targets. Assuming Robert Griffin III and company are improved in 2014, this provides some evidence that Garcon\u2019s numbers won\u2019t necessarily decline as his team gets more competitive (his numbers still could decline, of course, due to a decrease in overall pass attempts or well, any other reason).\n\nUpdate: How\u2019s this for incredible? I have Calvin Johnson down for only two meaningless receiving yards the entire season. Those came on this third 3rd-and-5 completion against Arizona in week two.\n\nI acknowledge that \u201ctargets\u201d is not the best way to measure opportunities; the ideal metric to use would be snap counts on pass plays or pass routes, but my resources are limited. Why does this matter? It\u2019s possible that soft defenses could have resulted in more targets for Shorts, too. If, for example, 35% of his passing routes came in meaningless situations and that\u2019s when he got 45% of his targets and 45% of his yards, I\u2019d argue that he was benefiting from soft coverage. On the other hand, if 55% of his pass snaps came in meaningless situations, but that\u2019s when he only got 45% of his yards, well perhaps he has Randy Moss syndrome and checked out of those games (or his teammates tended to do better in these situations, decreasing his number of targets). I also recognize that the idea of an 8-yard meaningless catch on 3rd-and-12 is a bit clunky when applied to the concept of a meaningless target or a meaningless snap in that situation. [\u21a9]\n\nDid Calvin Johnson not break your threshold of 100 meaningless yards? He isn\u2019t on the list.\n\nIan\n\nI would imagine so. Detroit didn\u2019t suffer many double-digit losses, and he didn\u2019t even play in one of them. And he\u2019s not really the kind of receiver you would throw to short of the sticks.\n\nChase Stuart\n\nGreat question. I\u2019ve updated the post.\n\nJames\n\nScanning the list only three players had a higher percentage of receiving yards than targets: Chris Ogboynna, Trent Richardson, and Chris Johnson.\n\nChecking down to a RB in a desparate situation has to be the definition of a meaningless pass.\n\nEdward\n\nThis might be a crazy request, but is it possible to see the entirety of the list?\n\nMattR\n\nWhy did you limit meaningless receiving yards to players on the losing team? It seems that if a player\u2019s team is winning by 17 with 6 minutes to go (for example), any receiving yards he gains after that point on the way to his teams\u2019s victory are just as meaningless as those of a player on the losing side of that game. Using the Super Bowl as an example, it seems weird that Demarius Thomas\u2019s touchdown reception to cut the game from 36-0 to 36-8 at the end of the 3rd quarter is considered meaningless but all the Seattle receptions on the ensuing possession, including Doug Baldwin\u2019s touchdown reception that increased Seattle\u2019s lead from 28 to 35, are not meaningless (especially since if Denver had managed to recover the onside kick and passed their way down the field for another TD to cut the lead to 21 all those yards would have been counted as meaningless)\n\nhttp://www.sports-central.org/sports/nfl/ Brad O.\n\nInteresting stuff. I would love to see this same method applied to QBs."
