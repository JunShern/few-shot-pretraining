Many important features are not supported on Android, like the Drawer native UI. Also, on one of my test phone(Moto G), the native UI calls in JavaScript are broken.\nFor me, the main reason to consider Steroids is about the native UI stuffs, but disappointing me on Android.\nWhat's even worse, Steroids has only iOS simulator support for now. So for Android development, you can only use the AppGyver Scanner on your Android phone.\nSo I would suggest you to do further evaluation if you are only working for iOS, or on Android but doesn't care about native UIs. Anyway, Steroids has a better workflow though.\nUpdate 10/18/2014:\nI've been working on some PhoneGap apps recently, and I think I may have found some more things related to this topic.\n\nToday's Steroids is having a much better Android support, with a fresh new Appgyver Scanner. Many native UI components are now working very well.\nSteroids has a closed-source build system, i.e. you will have to use their build service every time you want to publish a new version of your apps. However, this is somehow necessary, as Steroids is famous for its native UI components and native transitions.\nSteroids has a rather poor support for some of PhoneGap/Cordova plugins. This is also mainly because of the private build system. You can't build your final app by yourself in Eclipse/Android Studio/XCode like what we are doing for many other PhoneGap/Cordova apps.\nIf you want to take the advantage of native UI transitions provided by Steroids, your web project will be split into several parallel parts (who run in their own corresponding WebViews). This increases the complexity of your project, especially when you are using some web frameworks.\n\nSo, if you care a lot about native UIs, native transitions, and don't mind be bound to a proprietary platform, you can try Steroids. Otherwise, I would suggest you try Ionic(http://ionicframework.com/), which is a quite pure web implementation based on PhoneGap/Cordova.\n\n"
