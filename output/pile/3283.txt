    "text": "Work of Art type TV Show\n\nFinally, the second season of Work of Art: The Next Great Artist has arrived on Bravo, and with it, the Sucklord. Work of Art must have thought it died and went to heaven when this guy strolled in, disfiguring stormtrooper dolls and calling it art. The Sucklord \u2014 real name: Morgan Phillips \u2014 is a 42-year-old artist/huckster in the tradition of Jeff Koons who looks a bit like Jimmy Fallon doing an impersonation of a gelled twit. With this guy around, everyone becomes an inadvertent comedian. When another contestant, Michelle, said in the opening moments, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be the one who sucks\u201d \u2014 well, Lordy, supply your own just-look-to-your-right punchline.\n\nThe first challenge of the season was to take a piece of kitschy, garage-sale amateur art and \u201ctransform it into something that has your own style in it.\u201d This was a poor choice to start off the series, since it actually raised more art questions than it asked. Work of Art invited us to sneer at an array of sentimental sculptures and near-outsider-art paintings as, as various contestants said, \u201cjunk\u201d or \u201cgarbage.\u201d Only (wouldn\u2019t you know it) the Sucklord appreciated this stuff on its own terms \u2014 as expressions of genuine passion on the part of untalented but sincere artists. Or as the Sucklord said of his choice, a garish painting of The Lord of the Rings\u2018 Gandalf, \u201cThis picture is already perfect.\u201d And it was, on its own stunted terms.\n\nWe were able to get a fix on some of the 14 artists on the basis of a combination of the challenge, the show\u2019s introductory filmed bios, and the artists\u2019 catty comments about one another. For instance:\n\n\u2022 Jazz-Minh was raised on a \u201chippie commune\u201d and is therefore pegged as a ditzy free spirit; beware of countercultural stereotypes.\n\n\u2022 Bayete chose a painting of Scarlett O\u2019Hara and chose to make an African-American mirror image of the Southern belle; he glued dollar bills around the canvas and tried to pass it off as an example of \u201ccultural hybridity.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Lola is \u201cthis sprightly sexpot,\u201d said one opponent. In other words, this season\u2019s Jaclyn Santos. They wish.\n\n\u2022 Kathryn, who in her own time makes three-dimensional gush that looks like bloody cow intestines \u2014 excuse me, \u201cvisceral tableaux out of dough and jelly.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Tewz, the \u201cstreet artist\u201d seen spray-painting graffiti and groaning \u201cI don\u2019t really, like, do sculpture,\u201d which is this show\u2019s version of Top Chef\u2019s \u201cI don\u2019t do desserts\u201d \u2014 i.e., the what-the-hell-are-you-thinking-of-course-you\u2019re-going-to-be-asked-to-make-some-sculpture-wise-up-jerk-and-come-prepared contestant.\n\n\u2022 Michelle, who came on all gee-golly but demonstrated some serious paper-cutting-and-pasting chops in her intricate, sophisticated audition-tape work.\n\n\u2022 Dusty, an Arkansas elementary-school art teacher who made a very cute self-portrait out of raised Crayola crayons to qualify for this show. I was gravely disappointed that Dusty chose as his kitsch piece a paint-by-numbers portrait of a clown that was clearly the comedian Ed Wynn, but not one person on Work of Art knew enough to point this out.\n\n\u2022 Leon, who, I\u2019m sorry, but given the way he was presented, will, until he distinguishes himself more, inevitably be referred to initially as the deaf artist with the interpreter.\n\n\u2022 Ugo, the French guy who\u2019s very good-looking but who forgot to put an H in the front of his name.\n\n\u2022 The Sucklord explained both his choice of objet de schlock (\u201cThe Lord of the Rings is sort of a religious text for me\u201d) and his name: \u201cthe suckiness, which is my self-deprecating, misanthropic side, and the lord, which is my megalomaniacal, self-aggrandizing side.\u201d His biggest surprise: Some of his work has been bought and auctioned off by Work of Art \u201cmentor\u201d Simon de Pury. The guy\u2019s legit. Or as legit as you need to be to live in New York City and get Simon to simper over your work.\n\nWhoever I left out hasn\u2019t made an impression yet.\n\nDuring the final \u201ccrit\u201d session, we were reintroduced to the judging panel of hostess-with-the-mostest China Chow, New York magazine art critic Jerry Saltz, and Bill Powers; the guest judge was the photographer Mary Ellen Mark.\n\nThe judges were quick to decide whose piece they liked best. Michelle\u2019s The Eternal Woodsman had a witty delicacy that contrasted nicely with the stolid piece of kitsch she personalized and \u201ctransformed.\u201d It was a worthy winner.\n\nIn the bottom three were Ugo, Bayete, and the Sucklord. Everyone from the contestants to the judges had been dismissing Ugo\u2019s painted drawing as too similar to work by Keith Haring. Nobody was buying Bayete\u2019s racially charged but slapdash mess as \u201ccomplex\u201d (\u201cJust because the topic is complex doesn\u2019t mean your piece is complex,\u201d sneered Powers). And the Sucklord did not help himself (but completely won me over) by responding to Saltz\u2019s simple question about what was original about his work by answering, \u201cWow, you really got me there. I think I might die here.\u201d\n\nBut as cute as he is, Ugo was dismissed from Work of Art. Personally, I thought Bayete\u2019s piece was a tad more banal. And the way the hour was edited, the Sucklord received a greater degree of vehement criticism for his lack of originality. But Mary Ellen Mark said with equal force that the modified Gandalf \u201cspoke\u201d to her. (What did it say? \u201cLook at me.\u201d)\n\nAnd thus the Sucklord was permitted to coin his own catchphrase in bidding adieu to Ugo \u2014 \u201cIt sucks for all of us\u201d \u2014 and add with casual menace, \u201cI\u2019m a super-villain and better him than me.\u201d\n\nIs it, though? What did you think of Work of Art\u2018s season premiere? And where do you stand on the Sucklord: Lord of the Zings, or Trying Too Hard?"
