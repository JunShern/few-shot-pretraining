I want to limit this spin to a certain range (say, -15 to 50 degrees), and, furthermore, to make the legs go back and forth within the range, like a pendulum. \nSince I'm going for a 65 degree swath, I tried just changing \"%360\" to \"%65\" as a first step. But this made the legs go way too fast, and I cannot use a lower increment value if I want to use modulus, which only works on ints. \nIs there another way to achieve the desired first-step behavior? More importantly, how can I make the legs go back and forth? It's kind of hard to conceptualize with a function that is getting called multiple times (vs. just using a loop structure that takes care of everything, which I tried before I realized this!) \n\nA:\n\nand I cannot use a lower increment value if I want to use modulus, which only works on ints.\n\nThe % operator is broken anyway. You should not use integers, but floats, and use the fmod (double) or fmodf (float) function.\n\n"
