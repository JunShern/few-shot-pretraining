Test that it works:
```
python run_clm.py \
    --model_name_or_path EleutherAI/gpt-neo-125M \
    --dataset_name wikitext \
    --dataset_config_name wikitext-2-raw-v1 \
    --do_train \
    --max_train_samples 50 \
    --per_device_train_batch_size 1 \
    --evaluation_strategy epoch \
    --do_eval \
    --max_eval_samples 50 \

The section below is from the [HuggingFace examples README](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/v4.10.2/examples/pytorch/language-modeling):

## Language model training

Fine-tuning (or training from scratch) the library models for language modeling on a text dataset for GPT, GPT-2,
ALBERT, BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, XLNet... GPT and GPT-2 are trained or fine-tuned using a causal language modeling
(CLM) loss while ALBERT, BERT, DistilBERT and RoBERTa are trained or fine-tuned using a masked language modeling (MLM)
loss. XLNet uses permutation language modeling (PLM), you can find more information about the differences between those
objectives in our [model summary](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_summary.html).

There are two sets of scripts provided. The first set leverages the Trainer API. The second set with `no_trainer` in the suffix uses a custom training loop and leverages the ðŸ¤— Accelerate library . Both sets use the ðŸ¤— Datasets library. You can easily customize them to your needs if you need extra processing on your datasets.

**Note:** The old script `run_language_modeling.py` is still available [here](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/master/examples/legacy/run_language_modeling.py).

The following examples, will run on datasets hosted on our [hub](https://huggingface.co/datasets) or with your own
text files for training and validation. We give examples of both below.

### GPT-2/GPT and causal language modeling

The following example fine-tunes GPT-2 on WikiText-2. We're using the raw WikiText-2 (no tokens were replaced before
the tokenization). The loss here is that of causal language modeling.

```bash
python run_clm.py \
    --model_name_or_path gpt2 \
    --dataset_name wikitext \
    --dataset_config_name wikitext-2-raw-v1 \
    --do_train \
    --do_eval \
    --output_dir /tmp/test-clm
```

This takes about half an hour to train on a single K80 GPU and about one minute for the evaluation to run. It reaches
a score of ~20 perplexity once fine-tuned on the dataset.

To run on your own training and validation files, use the following command:

```bash
python run_clm.py \
    --model_name_or_path gpt2 \
    --train_file path_to_train_file \
    --validation_file path_to_validation_file \
    --do_train \
    --do_eval \
    --output_dir /tmp/test-clm
```

This uses the built in HuggingFace `Trainer` for training. If you want to use a custom training loop, you can utilize or adapt the `run_clm_no_trainer.py` script. Take a look at the script for a list of supported arguments. An example is shown below:

```bash
python run_clm_no_trainer.py \
    --dataset_name wikitext \
    --dataset_config_name wikitext-2-raw-v1 \
    --model_name_or_path gpt2 \
    --output_dir /tmp/test-clm
```
